I will make every effort to join this call, but just in case airline 
disruptions
defeat me I have two brief initial comments (beyond commending all involved 
for
making this significant effort):

1. To avoid alienating readers unnecessarily, I would suggest using a
subjunctive tense throughout, as in "would", rather than the rhetoric of
"shall."  E.g., "a forward contract would be deemed reasonable," as opposed to
"shall be deemed reasonable."

2. On the rate stabilization plan, please avoid proposals that involve 
freezing
the entire bundled electricity charge, as opposed to the generation commodity
charge.  Several stakeholders, including but not limited to NRDC, UCAN and 
PG&E,
support distribution pricing systems that involve regular small true-ups of 
the
rates that recover distribution revenues; frozen distribution charges are
incompatible with such systems.  I hope all involved will agree not to 
prejudge
this important issue in the rate stabilization proposal.
