FYI, Enron has been a member of this group (ACI), either as EES/ENA or 
Transwestern Pipeline/Gas Pipeline Group.  I think we have NOT paid dues this 
year,  but if you want to call on them, they may want us to pay up (not a 
problem in my opinion).  Also be aware that the pipeline group will probably 
have Tom Rutherford on retainer this year for our legislative session, and 
you may want to retain him as well to keep on the lookout for your issues.  
He has represented us in the electric issues in the past too, and is a great 
lobbyist.  His number is 505 265 7129.  I don't have ACI's number at the 
ready, but they are in Albuquerque (Tom would have it).  Let me know if I can 
help you in any way.

We may want to check in with this group as we begin our PUC certificate 
process in NM.

NEW MEXICO
Business group supports temporary franchise fee moratorium
The Association of Commerce and Industry of New Mexico has said it supports a 
temporary moratorium on telecom franchise fee increases, in-kind services, 
and requirements beyond those currently imposed by municipalities and 
counties. The association says the Legislature should ensure that fees for 
use of rights-of-way, franchises, and other authorizations to place telecom 
infrastructure in rights-of-way are cost-based.
The group also urges the Legislature to continue to monitor the Public 
Regulation Commission's activities to ensure timely implementation of SB 123 
and HB 400, which were signed into law by Gov. Gary Johnson (R.) earlier this 
year. The new laws require the PRC to move Qwest Corp. (formerly U S WEST 
Communications, Inc.) to an alternate form of regulation. The association 
also urges "appropriate funding" for the PRC to accomplish the move.
The association's recommendations were included in a 2001 legislative agenda 
released late last week.
