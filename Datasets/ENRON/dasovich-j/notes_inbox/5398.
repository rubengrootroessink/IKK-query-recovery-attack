I don't think it frees up any money.  The footnote is only indicating that 
they
have $50 million in lease obligations for the upcoming year.  I may be missing
something but what this would potentially affect is the asset turnover and
leverage ratios since non-capitalized leases are off-balance sheet items and 
so
don't get included in the Total Assets category.

Gang:
Quick question.  Does the lease-buy-back free up $50M of funds for 1987?
Mark, is that captured in the 1987 cash flows?  Don't think that should
change our recommendation, but ran across it in the case and was wondering
if we captured it.

Best,
Jeff
