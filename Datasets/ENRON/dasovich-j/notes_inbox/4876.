Jeff, 
??????? The Yellow Book is in the mail. I read it over the weekend and found 
it to be a very good backgrounder for this whole thing. Thanks for lending it 
to me, and thanks again for your time Friday.

??????? A followup question: You had told me Friday that the arrival of QF's 
and other non-utility generators, including plants in neighboring states, had 
large customers chomping at the bit for competition, but frustrated because 
the big IOUs still controlled the grid and held the customers captive. But 
the Yellow book said that already some large customers had found ways to 
bypass the IOUs and get direct access/retail wheeling. 

??????? Could you explain? 
??????? Thanks,  
??????? Dale. 
PS - Please don't forget to call Steve Kean to let him know I'll be calling 
him. Thanks.
