James, Cameron, Ian,

?

I got a call this morning from Marc Eichmann, a?DealBench Product Manager at 
Enron Net Works.? He got my contact info from Ken Sommers, one of the 
Procurement Managers in EES, who has been pushing to get our solutions 
implemented.? 

?

Marc is meeting today with a team of directors to determine how to go forward 
in providing reverse auction and RFQ functionality to the various Enron 
business.? They realize that DealBench does not provide the breadth of 
functionality required to get acceptance by the buyers/dealmakers for daily 
use.? Thus they are trying to determine whether to?put the time and resources 
into developing DealBench further or to strike a deal with a third party 
vendor to enhance their platform.

?

The project is in its early stages.? Their timeline is 2-3 months before 
implementation.? Enron business units would be the primary users of the 
software, but?they would eventually want to sell this service out to all 
users of EnronOnline.? Marc said they would want to be able to open up the 
code and conjoin our software with theirs.? 

?

He wants us to basically hand it away.? I discussed our standard Enterprise 
pricing and the Charter Program offer we have given to GSS and EES, and he 
still felt this was beyond their budget.? He emphasized how much business 
volume runs through EnronOnline and how good an opportunity this would be for 
us.? I told him I would like to have our VP Business Development speak with 
him to discuss any further business relationship and pricing details.? Marc 
can be reached at 713-345-8422 or marc.eichmann@enron.com.?

?

I've tried to followup with Ken Sommers and Eugene Ribaudo to get a feel for 
how we might be able to proceed with a sale directly?to EES versus a marriage 
with DealBench.? Ken is out of town this week, but hopefully will respond to 
my voice mail and email.? Let me know how to proceed.

?

Thanks,

David M. Young
