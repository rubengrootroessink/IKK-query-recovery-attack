***Delete if you have already purchased your Leading Edge ticket.***

The Acteva ticketing site went down for a little while yesterday
afternoon.  The problem has been corrected, but we have extended the ticket
deadline until Noon TODAY (Thursday, 21 September). After that time, we
will be opening up the wait list and the remaining tickets will be
distributed "first-come, first-serve"
