Jeff, My bad.  I forgot to update my address book with your new "migrated" 
e-mail address.

Please consider this a reminder that your "IRT" updates are now due to Rick 
Shapiro & Sue Nord.  

From this point forward, I have taken over for Joseph in distributing and 
updating this report.

In order to facilitate processing this report in a timely manner, please 
utilize the attached Excel file (see below), which contains a worksheet that 
shows the September report, as well as a worksheet with each individuals 
name.  

Please use the September report as a reference for your October report.  
Also, you can "cut & paste" from the September report to use in your update, 
but you are no longer able to change the report as you were previously.  
Please call me directly if you have any questions about this new form.  

Please complete and return to me by COB Friday, October 6th.  I will be 
forwarding this document to Rick and Sue first thing Monday morning.

I will be out of the office on Thursday and Friday.  If you have questions 
regarding the form, please contact me at 503/998-0698.  Please do not contact 
Joseph, as he will not be able to help you.

Thanks in advance for your assistance.

Lysa
