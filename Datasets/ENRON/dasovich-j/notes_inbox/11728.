Transmission lines project draws bidders
By Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writer
(Published July 24, 2001)=20
Aiming to ease one of the festering problems in California's energy crisis,=
=20
13 companies and public agencies have bid for the right to widen a notoriou=
s=20
bottleneck in the state's transmission lines, federal officials said Monday=
.=20
The bidders range from the East Bay Municipal Utility District to wholesale=
=20
power generators such as Mirant Corp., Calpine Corp. and Williams Cos. Some=
=20
independent experts argue that if a generator wins the bid, it could use it=
s=20
control over those transmission lines to manipulate the electricity market.=
=20
The bottleneck is Path 15, a narrow 90-mile stretch of power lines near Los=
=20
Banos that carries electricity between Northern and Southern California. It=
=20
has less transmission capacity than other portions of the power grid, which=
=20
has led to blackouts.=20
In January, Northern California suffered power outages in part because Path=
=20
15 couldn't deliver the surplus electricity that was available in Southern=
=20
California. The proposed expansion would add 1,500 megawatts of capacity.=
=20
"It's a very big issue; there's been a lot of congestion," said Severin=20
Borenstein of the University of California Energy Institute.=20
In addition, the Independent System Operator, which manages the power grid,=
=20
estimates the congestion generated by Path 15 added an estimated $221.7=20
million to California's power bill in a 16-month period that ended in=20
December.=20
Borenstein said he believes there are considerable hidden costs as well,=20
because the bottleneck has created an incentive for sellers to withhold=20
power. Path 15 effectively cuts California into two separate markets, makin=
g=20
it easier for sellers to manipulate each submarket to raise prices, he said=
.=20
Pacific Gas and Electric Co., which owns the existing Path 15 transmission=
=20
lines, already has been conducting environmental studies with an eye toward=
=20
widening the path. To speed things along, the federal government in May ask=
ed=20
for bids on the project, which sparked proposals from generators and others=
.=20
Borenstein said having a generator widen Path 15 could bring new problems.=
=20
Whoever builds the additional power lines owns them and can charge "tolls" =
to=20
companies that use the lines to transmit electricity. A power generator cou=
ld=20
deliberately withhold supplies, thereby increasing the congestion on Path 1=
5,=20
and increase the tolls, Borenstein said.=20
PG&E is among those bidding to widen the path. So is its sister company, an=
=20
unregulated entity called PG&E National Energy Group. Other bidders include=
 a=20
partnership led by Sempra Energy Resources, an unregulated sister company o=
f=20
San Diego Gas & Electric Co.=20
The federal government estimates it will take $300 million and three or fou=
r=20
years to widen Path 15. The costs are ultimately paid by utility customers.=
=20
U.S. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, speaking to reporters in Los Angeles=
=20
on Monday, called the expansion of Path 15 "a critical component in solving=
=20
the long-term power crisis in this state."=20

(Published July 24, 2001)=20
The wrestling match between politicians and Enron Corp. moved into a more=

At one point last spring, state Attorney General Bill Lockyer said he wante=

Most other energy companies have complied with the demands, creating=20

ph=20
Dunn, D-Santa Ana. But Enron has refused, and on Saturday, Dunn submitted a=
=20
report asking the Senate for "an appropriate coercive sanction."=20
Does Enron have something to hide? Or does it sincerely believe that what's=
=20
happening in California is political scapegoating? Are the companies' fears=
=20
about the confidentiality of the data sought by the Senate justified? Would=
=20
data be selectively leaked to show the firms in the worst light? Would data=

be used by competitors? Or could the information find its way into the hand=
s=20
of class-action attorneys?=20
Dunn, a prominent trial attorney himself, insists that confidentiality will=
=20
be protected and that the information being sought is only for legislative=
=20
purposes. But Enron and the other companies have some reason to be wary of=
=20
turning over confidential information to politicians. Similar information w=
as=20
leaked -- without penalty -- in last year's investigation of former state=
=20
Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush. And there are indications that=20
private lawyers are working closely with investigators.=20
Mike Aguirre, the San Diego attorney seeking a "smoking gun" to prove=20
collusion among energy companies, supplied Dunn's committee with a few=20
dissident Duke Energy workers who alleged, in highly publicized hearings,=
=20
that the firm had manipulated production at its San Diego plant to create=

artificial shortages and drive up spot market power prices. Duke then refut=

the charges by releasing some excerpts from the records of the Independent=

System Operator, the controller of California's power grid, indicating that=

Aguirre subsequently asked the governor's office to pressure the ISO -- now=

=20
that would show, he says, that the firm actually manipulated the situation.=
=20
Duke and other companies insist that the ISO-held documents are proprietary=

Aguirre pleaded with one Davis adviser in an e-mail that "we need your help=

he had not yet obtained cooperation from Davis aides.=20
The political and legal struggle to affix blame for California's energy woe=

Cardoza's proposal is the first of what observers say could be several=20

Daniel Weintraub: There's no shame in doing nothing for Edison


(Published July 24, 2001)=20

To understand why state lawmakers are inching closer to handing over billio=
ns=20
of dollars of consumers' money to California's second-largest utility, you=
=20
need to appreciate the collective psyche of the Legislature. Not appreciate=
=20
as in enjoy. But appreciate in a scientific way, in the manner of an=20
anthropologist studying the mores of a foreign culture.=20
Confronted with a big problem, legislators think they need to solve it. Doi=
ng=20
nothing is not a comfortable option. It makes them feel ineffective and=20
impotent. When the governor is demanding a bill, the pressure grows even mo=
re=20
intense. They want to do something -- anything -- rather than having to go=
=20
back to their districts and admit that the problem is not theirs to fix.=20
In this case, though, doing nothing might be the wisest course.=20
Lawmakers now have on their desks three bills that take various approaches =
to=20
rescuing Southern California Edison from the brink of bankruptcy. The compa=
ny=20
has a $3.5 billion debt left over from the state's failed experiment in=20
electricity deregulation. If something isn't done about it in the next few=
=20
weeks, the utility's future is likely to wind up in the hands of a judge.=
=20
But all three bills ignore a fundamental fact: Edison got itself into this=
=20
mess. Maybe the utility should get itself out.=20
Edison was a big cheerleader for the 1996 bill that restructured the way=20
electricity was bought and sold in California. Supporting a freeze on retai=
l=20
rates, which was the centerpiece of that legislation, the company took a hu=
ge=20
gamble. If wholesale prices remained low, Edison would rake in billions by=
=20
capturing the difference between the price it paid for power and the much=
=20
higher price it was allowed to charge its customers. The money would go to=
=20
compensate the utility for power plants it built as a regulated monopoly,=
=20
plants that might no longer be profitable in a free-market, competitive=20
industry.=20
Like all gambles, this one came with a risk. If wholesale prices rose, they=
=20
might exceed the retail rate cap. Edison would be forced to sell its=20
electricity at retail for less than it was paying in the wholesale market.=
=20
The tide of dollars that flowed in so nicely would begin to flow back out=
=20
again.=20
And that's exactly what happened. Some of the world's smartest utility mind=
s=20
guessed wrong. An electricity surplus turned into a shortage. Wholesale=20
prices soared. Things got so bad at Edison that the state stepped in to buy=
=20
power on the company's behalf.=20
But before things got ugly, Edison enjoyed two flush years of artificially=
=20
high rates. During 1998 and 1999, the company pocketed billions from its=20
customers, paid down debt and sent money to its parent firm, Edison=20
International.=20
Now Edison wants to divide the question. The money that flowed in, Edison=
=20
says, the company should get to keep. And the money that flowed out -- well=
,=20
that should be someone else's responsibility. The utility is asking the=20
Legislature to ignore the first two years of hefty profits and reimburse th=
e=20
company for the one year of big losses.=20
Gov. Gray Davis negotiated his version of the Edison bailout several months=
=20
ago, but that deal was seen as so rich for the company that it went nowhere=
=20
in the Legislature. The Senate approved its version last week, a bill that=
=20
would reduce the payout to Edison by $1 billion and then stick business wit=
h=20
the remaining tab. The Assembly, meanwhile, is considering two other=20
measures, both of which would spread the pain between business and=20
residential consumers.=20
"This is corporate welfare at its worst," state Sen. Bill Morrow,=20
R-Oceanside, said of the Senate bill. "This is not even a bailout. It's a=
=20
corporate handout."=20
Edison and the state's other big utility, Pacific Gas & Electric, which is=
=20
already in bankruptcy, say they are entitled to the money because they neve=
r=20
should have been put in the position of charging less for electricity than=
=20
they were paying to obtain it. That's a legal argument that belongs before =
a=20
judge. There is a good chance the court would want to balance the profits t=
he=20
utilities made under deregulation with the losses they incurred. Under that=
=20
scenario, they wouldn't need a bailout.=20
But even if the utilities were to win their case, consumers probably would=
=20
fare no worse than they would under the various legislative proposals under=
=20
consideration.=20
Sen. Steve Peace, D-San Diego, who helped craft the 1996 bill that=20
restructured the industry and who now supports the Edison bailout, lectured=

his fellow senators on the floor the other day about the need to take a ris=

"We can do nothing and be safe," Peace said. "Or we can do something, and d=

our job."=20
Everyone is weary of the state's energy crisis. It is human nature to want =

State consultants don't see need for more rate hikes =20


\
objattph=20
Outlook brightens; price cut may be possible by 2003 By Ed Mendel =20
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER  July 23, 2001  SACRAMENTO -- State consultants,=
=20
releasing a new estimate of power costs with an improved outlook, said=20
yesterday they do not believe an additional rate increase will be needed --=
=20
and a rate cut may be possible by 2003.  The state issued a long-awaited=20
"revenue requirement" asking for a little more than half of the revenue fro=
m=20
a record rate increase imposed by the state Public Utilities Commission=20
earlier this year.  The state power-purchasing agency, the Department of=20
Water Resources, wants 1.65 cents of an increase of 3 cents per kilowatt-ho=
ur=20
that began last month for customers of Pacific Gas and Electric and Souther=
n=20
California Edison.=20
The PUC is not expected to rule on the state's revenue request until the=20
middle of next month, when the regulators also are scheduled to approve an=
=20
increase for the customers of San Diego Gas & Electric.  PG&E and Edison di=
d=20
not immediately say whether the state's proposal would leave enough money f=
or=20
the utilities. But as if expecting criticism, the state consultants said=20
utilities often ask for larger rate increases than they are granted.  An=20
adviser to Gov. Gray Davis said the administration was "mocked" by critics=
=20
when it forecast in April that the average cost of power would drop during=
=20
the summer, even though heat would drive up the demand for power.  "Quote:=
=20
'They just don't know what they are doing,' " consultant S. David Freeman=
=20
recalled the critics saying. "Well, we did know what we were doing. Quite=
=20
frankly, I think this is a good-news story of major proportions."  The wide=
ly=20
derided forecast issued in April said the average cost of power that must b=
e=20
purchased on the expensive spot market would drop from $346 per megawatt-ho=
ur=20
in April through June to $195 in July through September.  Now the "reasonab=
ly=20
conservative" estimate is that the average price of power in July through=
=20
September will be $129 to $130 per megawatt-hour, said Ron Nichols of=20
Navigant Consulting.  Nichols attributed the price drop to a number of=20
factors: long-term contracts, cooler weather, cheaper natural gas used by=
=20
generators, more small and large generators back online and floating federa=
l=20
price caps.  The state began buying power for utility customers Jan. 17 aft=
er=20
PG&E and Edison, whose rates were frozen by deregulation as wholesale power=
=20
costs soared, ran up massive debts and were no longer able to borrow.  The=
=20
consultants estimated that the state will have spent $13 billion on power b=
y=20
the end of next year. But they also predicted that the state power-purchasi=
ng=20
fund would develop a substantial surplus by then.  "That would allow for a=
=20
rate decrease in 2003, based on our current projections," said Joseph Fiche=
ra=20
of Saber Partners.  The new revenue requirement issued by the state yesterd=
ay=20
is needed for a series of actions planned by the PUC next month to pay for =
a=20
record bond issue to repay the taxpayer-supported state general fund for=20
power purchases.  Fichera said that, despite reports to the contrary, the=
=20
recommendation is for a $12.5 billion bond -- leaving a cushion in the=20
authorization of $13.4 billion. The bond will be paid off by ratepayers ove=
r=20
15 years.  The consultants said their projection of state power costs is=20
cautious. They assume consumer conservation will drop from 7 percent to 6=
=20
percent, though it actually has been 11 percent and 12 percent in recent=20
months.  The projections are intended to leave some ability to absorb=20
unforeseen costs, such as scorching temperatures later this summer or next=
=20
summer, or a spike in natural gas prices as happened last winter.  The cost=
=20
projections do not include any overcharge refund from generators. Davis has=
=20
asked federal regulators for an $8.9 billion refund and has vowed to seek=
=20
full recovery in the courts.  The governor wants to get the state out of th=
e=20
power-buying business by the end of next year. But that requires legislativ=
e=20
approval of a rescue plan for Edison that could become a model for getting=

PG&E out of bankruptcy.  The Senate, which left for a monthlong recess afte=

CHINO
Rush for Power Plant in Chino Raises Concerns
Energy: The facility may exceed pollution limits if it begins operations by=

Sept. 30. Opponents say that would endanger public health.
By TERENCE MONMANEY
TIMES STAFF WRITER

July 24 2001

CHINO -- Seldom are government bureaucrats criticized for moving too quickl=
y,=20
but so goes the battle here over a power plant slated for the sun-blasted=
=20
grounds of a men's prison.

The proposed plant--big enough to supply 135,000 homes--is one of five in=
=20
California that have been licensed to start up despite exceeding pollution=
=20
standards as part of Gov. Gray Davis' rush to bring more power online.

The program, covering small to mid-size facilities that run during hours of=
=20
peak demand, slashes licensing review from a year to three weeks, eliminate=
s=20
comprehensive environmental analyses, and authorizes plants to emit=20
pollutants for months at levels exceeding state and federal air quality law=
s.=20
The catch is that the plants must operate by Sept. 30 or those rare and=20
lucrative incentives could be withdrawn--a possibility confronting develope=
rs=20
of the Chino plant, which a growing number of environmentalists opposes.

So far, with only 69 days left until the deadline, workers haven't poured a=
=20
drop of concrete foundation for the $125-million natural gas-burning=20
facility, developed by Delta Power Co. of New Jersey. The site is on the=20
outskirts of the California Institution for Men.

The proposed plant, the largest of 11 so-called peakers given expedited=20
approval, is galvanizing opposition to the governor's emergency fast-track=
=20
program. Environmentalists decry the fact that until the plant installs=20
devices to reduce nitrogen oxide compounds, which contribute to smog, the=
=20
level of the pollutant will reach five times the legal limit.

Five groups, including the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Planni=
ng=20
and Conservation League, have joined in petitioning state air quality=20
officials to deny the plant a final operating permit. They contend that=20
excess nitrogen oxides will endanger public health and that the fast-track=
=20
process jeopardizes decades of gains against smog.

"We're not necessarily opposed to a power plant on the site," said Gail=20
Ruderman Feuer, an attorney in the Los Angeles office of the Natural=20
Resources Defense Council. "We're just opposed to one without environmental=
=20
review and without all the pollution controls."

Critics also are wary of the fast-track process because the state has a=20
vested interest in making sure the plants are built quickly. The Davis=20
administration has promised to spend billions buying electricity from plant=
s=20
that aren't built yet.

"It's a massive subterfuge," said Sandra Spelliscy, an attorney with the=20
Planning and Conservation League in Sacramento.

Jay Roland, manager of the Chino facility for Pegasus Power Partners, a=20
subsidiary of Delta, said the extra nitrogen oxides released from the plant=
=20
for a month or so are "not going to cause damage to anybody."

Roland said he is so frustrated by the "interveners," he sometimes wishes t=
he=20
whole state would go dark, to underscore the power shortage that the plant =
is=20
intended to address.

Though opponents have made a tough job even tougher, he said he hoped to ma=
ke=20
the end-of-summer deadline. Missing it could mean applying to the state all=
=20
over again under the old rules, he said. "Then I sit here nine months with=
=20
$120 million in equipment that's not generating any revenue."

State officials said it was necessary to approve the extra-polluting plants=
=20
because of the need to avoid blackouts and because there is a backlog of=20
emissions-control equipment. Besides, they said, state-of-the-art gas-burni=
ng=20
plants emit fewer pollutants without controls than do many older plants wit=
h=20
them.

Kevin Kennedy, a California Energy Commission official who reviewed the Chi=
no=20
project, acknowledged that public involvement in the process has suffered=
=20
somewhat. "It's been difficult to get the word out . . . to make sure peopl=
e=20
in the communities have enough information to know what's going on."

Site Seems Ideal for Power Plant

In many respects, the 11-acre Chino site looks right for a power plant. It=
=20
rests on flat surplus land at the northern boundary of the state's largest=
=20
prison property, where grasslands cover hundreds of acres.

Half a mile away is a booming warehouse district and a Southern California=
=20
Edison substation, which would relay the new power to the transmission grid=
.

Moreover, Pegasus runs a small power plant on the prison property across a=
=20
narrow utility road from the site. Supplying steam and a few megawatts to t=
he=20
penal institution, the company sells the bulk of its 27 megawatt output to=
=20
Edison.

Delta's president, Dean Vanech, bristles at charges that his company doesn'=
t=20
care about the environment.

He said equipment to reduce nitrogen oxide compounds won't be available unt=
il=20
around November, at which time engineers will work "as quickly as humanly=
=20
possible" to install it. Other air pollutants, such as carbon monoxide and=
=20
microscopic dust particles, will be controlled from the beginning.

Also, though energy officials reviewed the proposal in a matter of weeks,=
=20
they closely scrutinized the company's nine-part application, which took tw=
o=20
months and $1 million to assemble, plant officials say.

The company moved the plant's site after biologists discovered two protecte=
d=20
bird species nesting nearby--burrowing owls and red-tailed hawks. That=20
required engineers to redesign gas, water and transmission lines and tinker=
=20
with the plant structure, Roland said.

Owlets in a nest by a proposed transmission tower still pose an obstacle. "=
We=20
have to wait for the babies to leave," construction manager Robert Surette=
=20
said.

Key decisions over the plant's future lie with the South Coast Air Quality=
=20
Management District, the air pollution agency, which said in May it would=
=20
give the Chino plant a construction permit.

But after environmental groups petitioned in late June, the agency asked=20
Pegasus for more data describing the possible impact of elevated levels of=
=20
nitrogen oxides on people in the plant's vicinity.

"We're still in the evaluation phase, and we're not going to prejudge this=
=20
project," said district executive director Barry Wallerstein.

He said the plant emissions were probably negligible compared with those fr=
om=20
the parade of diesel trucks in the nearby warehouse district. Those "could =
be=20
a larger health hazard to the community than this particular power plant," =
he=20
said.

Public Hearing to Be Held Today

The air quality agency has scheduled a public hearing today at its Diamond=
=20
Bar office to weigh issuing the plant a waiver needed to exceed state air=
=20
quality standards. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has indicated i=
t=20
will not prosecute the Pegasus plant for temporarily emitting more nitrogen=
=20
oxides than the federal Clean Air Act permits.

Vanech of Delta said the company would want to build the plant even if it h=
ad=20
not received expedited approval: "The reason we're doing the project is tha=
t=20
we have a favorable long-term view of the California energy market.'

Delta operates 13 power plants nationwide, five of them in California on=20
state-controlled property.

The Chino plant promises to benefit this diverse, mostly blue-collar city o=
f=20
66,000. Although the developer is leasing the property from the state, Delt=
a=20
agreed to pay the city $500,000 up front, plus $75,000 annually and million=
s=20
more over the years in water and natural gas fees.

Vanech said the half-million-dollar "host fee" was compensation to City Hal=
l=20
for its swift handling of the project's mountainous paperwork and for the=
=20
wear and tear that construction crews will cause on city roads.

In the neighborhood closest to the plant, where large new houses rest on=20
half-acre lots fronted by bridle paths, residents seemed divided.

Jim Tippings, 59, who is retired, said he didn't have a problem with the=20
plant running a month or so without full nitrogen oxide controls: "I don't=
=20
think a month is going to hurt us." Rising utility bills are what really=20
hurt, he said.

Up the street, 35-year-old Kent Hobbenslefken was not aware that a power=20
plant was going up a mile away. A former hazardous waste manager who sells=

full pollution controls, just to meet a bureaucratic deadline.

"What's a couple of months delay?" he said. "We're already in the crisis.=

Surplus Power Sold at a Loss
Electricity: Cool summer and effective conservation efforts result in exces=
s=20
supplies. Industry officials say it's a routine move.
By NANCY VOGEL
TIMES STAFF WRITER

July 24 2001

SACRAMENTO -- Caught with an excess of electricity as a result of cool=20
weather and heavy conservation, the state government sold power at a loss=
=20
approaching $14 million in the first 16 days of July.

The loss amounts to roughly 3.5% of the total amount the state spent on pow=
er=20
during that period.

To keep power flowing to 27 million Californians, the state purchased 3.5=
=20
million megawatt-hours at an average price of $118 per megawatt-hour,=20
according to the state Department of Water Resources. It sold off 177,000=
=20
surplus megawatt-hours at an average price of $36.95 per megawatt-hour.=20
Department of Water Resources Director Thomas Hannigan disclosed the detail=
s=20
in response to an inquiry by Assemblyman John Campbell (R-Irvine).

The sales of surplus power "get to the issue of, do these people really kno=
w=20
what they're doing? Are they really competent to be managing this to the=20
lowest cost for the ratepayers?" Campbell said. "It reinforces to me that w=
e=20
should get the state out of doing this as soon as practically possible."

Industry officials, however, say it is routine for utilities and electricit=
y=20
companies to at times find themselves with more electricity than their=20
customers need. They either sell the power at a loss, work out an exchange =
of=20
power or give it away.

"It's not all that uncommon for utilities to be buying one day and selling=
=20
the next," said one Pacific Northwest trader who asked not to be identified=
=20
because his company does not permit him to talk to reporters. He said a rul=
e=20
of thumb in the industry is to match supply to demand within 1% to 2%,=20
although "5% on a load like California isn't that much."

Assemblyman Roderick Wright (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the Assembly=20
utilities committee, said he did not see a problem with DWR's power sales.

"Right now the summer is cool," he said. "If this had been a normal July, w=
e=20
would have used all that power."

"The worm could have turned the other way."

Department of Water Resources spokesman Oscar Hidalgo said the state's crew=
=20
of 15 power purchasers found themselves selling a "very minimal" amount of=
=20
electricity in May. In June, more power was sold, but less than was sold in=
=20
July, he said. The department has not released those figures.

Department officials expect the sales to stop if temperatures heat up later=
=20
this week.

The water department was thrust into the role of buying 30% to 50% of the=
=20
state's overall electricity in January after the state's major utilities=20
became so financially crippled by high wholesale electricity prices that=20
energy companies refused to sell to them.

The department has so far spent roughly $8 billion of taxpayer money=20
purchasing power that is sent to the customers of Pacific Gas & Electric,=
=20
Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric.

Hidalgo said the sales show that the water department has stabilized the=20
state's electricity market. The average price the department has paid for a=
=20
megawatt-hour is falling, from $271 in May to $119 in June to $89 so far in=
=20
July.

"If we were out scrambling for power right now," Hidalgo said, "the market=
=20
would reflect that and adjust to it, and we would most likely be paying muc=
h=20
more in overall purchases."

Campbell said he assumes the department sold its most expensive, marginal=
=20
megawatts of power. But Hidalgo said that is not necessarily so. The=20
department does not track what it paid for the power it sells, he said.

The department's statement to Campbell shows sales to 25 different companie=
s,=20
including the federal Bonneville Power Administration, the Los Angeles=20
Department of Water and Power, and several private energy companies that=20
bought power plants from California's utilities under the state's 1996=20
deregulation scheme. Those firms include Dynegy Corp., Reliant Energy, Mira=

San Diego -- This city, which was first to bear the brunt of the state's=20
energy crisis a year ago as electricity bills tripled, is now aiming to be=
=20
first with a long- term solution: regional public power.=20
A bill is making its way through the Legislature -- and being fought at eve=
ry=20
turn by the power industry -- to make San Diego County one of the largest=
=20
municipal utility districts in the nation.=20
If the measure fails, San Diego officials intend to refashion the local wat=
er=20
authority as an alternative utility hub that would construct efficient new=
=20
plants and steal business away from costlier, decades-old facilities owned =
by=20
out-of-state generators.=20
Some consumer advocates believe that San Diego's efforts could serve as a=
=20
model for large-scale public power systems in Northern California.=20
"If we can pull this off, we can bring down prices and show the way to ener=
gy=20
independence," said Rep. Bob Filner, D-San Diego. "If we don't change the=
=20
rules, we're going to be back where we were."=20
It won't be easy, though. Even if San Diego can overcome vigorous oppositio=
n=20
from power companies, its public-power scheme still could run afoul of Gov.=
=20
Gray Davis, who is counting on statewide revenue to finance next month's=20
municipal bond offering, the largest in U.S. history. Going its own way as =
a=20
municipal utility district would mean San Diego could avoid purchasing=20
electricity from the state Department of Water Resources, thus reducing the=
=20
flow of cash into California's coffers.=20
Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the governor, said Davis would not take a=
=20
position on San Diego's public-power bill until it cleared the Legislature.=
=20
"But the governor would obviously look extremely carefully at anything that=
=20
would affect revenue to pay off the bonds," he said.=20
Twelve months after California's energy crisis first erupted in San Diego,=
=20
leading to statewide blackouts and financial catastrophe for utilities,=20
residents of this city, to a large extent, have tried to put last summer's=
=20
difficulties behind them.=20
San Diego Gas & Electric Co., owned by Sempra Energy, had been the first of=
=20
California's three investor-owned utilities to pay off outstanding debts an=
d=20
thus qualify for a lifting of the rate freeze that accompanied deregulation=
=20
of the state's power market.=20
Unfortunately for San Diegans, wholesale electricity prices suddenly=20
skyrocketed, and San Diego Gas & Electric was free to pass along its rising=
=20
costs directly to consumers.=20
Customers of Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison we=
re=20
still protected by the rate freeze and thus saw no changes in their power=
=20
bills -- although the two utilities, in turn, were forced to absorb about $=
14=20
billion in unrecovered expenses.=20
San Diego power rates subsequently were limited by state regulators to=20
restore stability to the local market -- but not before many residential an=
d=20
business customers saw their monthly bills go through the roof.=20
"I'm still paying almost double what I was paying before," said George=20
Aguilar, owner of a downtown jewelry store. "We should talk to lawyers and=
=20
sue the people in the government responsible for this. It was pure=20
negligence."=20
WELL-INFORMED POLITICIANS
In fact, San Diego's political leaders are now among the best informed in t=
he=20
nation about energy issues and the volatility of electricity markets.=20
When power bills spiked last year, outraged consumers demanded that their=
=20
representatives take steps to remedy the situation. Democrats and Republica=
ns=20
alike took a crash course in the frequently arcane minutiae of the energy=
=20
business.=20
"We didn't create this problem. We didn't make any mistakes," said San Dieg=
o=20
Supervisor Dianne Jacob, who has been among the most aggressive local=20
politicians in responding to the energy mess and is a leading proponent of=
=20
the county's public-power plan.=20
"But one way or another, we're going to have to pay for it," she said. "Thi=
s=20
was a very bad experiment."=20
Her solution is to establish a vast municipal utility that essentially woul=
d=20
take over the entire service area of San Diego Gas & Electric, which provid=
es=20
power to 1.2 million customers.=20
PLANS FOR NEW POWER PLANTS
The county-run utility would build its own power plants and renewable- ener=
gy=20
resources and would transmit electricity to customers over existing San Die=
go=20
Gas & Electric lines. Funding for the municipal utility's activities is not=
=20
yet clear.=20
"There's no question in my mind that we can generate power for less than wh=
at=20
the generators are putting on the market," Jacob said.=20
REGIONAL APPROACH PRAISED
Medea Benjamin, a San Francisco consumer advocate, said the regional approa=
ch=20
sought by San Diego -- which requires a rewriting of state law -- would=20
benefit consumers by making construction of new plants more economically=20
feasible.=20
Municipal utility districts statewide are now limited to individual cities.=
=20
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power is one of the few large enoug=
h=20
to generate its own juice and sell off excess capacity.=20
San Francisco voters will be asked in November whether to replace the=20
existing San Francisco Public Utilities Commission with an independent powe=
r=20
and water authority.=20
"It would be wonderful if San Diego's disastrous experience with deregulati=
on=20
results in them taking a leadership role in creation of regional public=20
power," Benjamin said.=20
Not everyone, however, backs the plan. San Diego Gas & Electric's parent,=
=20
Sempra, has actively lobbied against the public-power bill in Sacramento,=
=20
fearing that it would allow seizure of the utility's distribution system by=
 a=20
county energy authority.=20
"It's unclear what the bill is trying to accomplish," said Art Larson, a=20
Sempra spokesman. "California's energy crisis isn't a local-utility problem=
.=20
It's a demand-and-supply problem."=20
PUBLIC OWNERSHIP CRITICIZED
Another considerable opponent of the plan is Jessie Knight, head of the San=
=20
Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce and a former member of the state Public=
=20
Utilities Commission.=20
He believes that public officials are no match for savvy power-industry=20
executives in a competitive marketplace and that the county cannot guarante=
e=20
lower rates by building its own plants.=20
"This thing looks like the biggest shell game in the world," Knight said.=
=20
Moreover, he said, he could not see how San Diego would win legislative=20
backing for regional public power when state authorities, including the=20
governor, were counting on revenue from all customers to back California's=
=20
multibillion-dollar bond offering.=20
Assemblyman Mark Wyland, R-Escondido (San Diego County), author of the=20
public-power bill, said it was too soon for anyone to speculate about San=
=20
Diego's breaking away from the rest of the state's power grid.=20
"We have to be realistic about the future of this," he said. "Right now,=20
SDG&E is the utility in San Diego County, and there is no intent to transfo=
rm=20
that overnight."=20
Meanwhile, in case Wyland's bill is defeated, a separate legislative effort=
=20
is taking shape to expand the San Diego water authority's jurisdiction to=
=20
include electricity.=20

13 plans submitted to alleviate power transmission bottleneck=20

Washington -- More than a dozen private investors have turned in proposals =
to=20
ease a Central Valley bottleneck in California's electricity transmission=
=20
grid that can contribute to blackouts in Northern California, Energy=20
Secretary Spencer Abraham said yesterday.=20
The 13 investment plans were in response to the Bush administration's=20
national energy plan, which called for the expansion of Path 15, an 84-mile=
=20
stretch of interconnected transmission lines located between Los Banos=20
(Merced County) and Coalinga (Fresno County). The lines form the main link=
=20
for power flows between the northern and southern parts of the state.=20
"When we announced our plan in May to upgrade Path 15, it was dismissed as =
an=20
old idea on which little had ever been done," Abraham said in a statement.=
=20
"Today, I am pleased to announce that those days of neglect and inaction ar=
e=20
over."=20
The administration's plan calls for $230 million in new investment from loc=
al=20
utilities and other private entities. Abraham called it "the first concrete=
=20
step to relieve congestion on the state's power grid."=20
The Bush administration, he said, "is taking a leadership role in addressin=
g=20
a long-neglected problem in Caifornia's electricity transmission system."=
=20
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. owns Path 15. During the late 1980s, the utili=
ty=20
held public hearings in the Central Valley to discuss a possible expansion,=
=20
but dropped the plans after concluding that existing transmission lines cou=
ld=20
handle future demand.=20
When California's electricity shortages began to mount last year, Path 15=
=20
proved to be a major bottleneck. By preventing an increased flow of power=
=20
from the southern to the northern parts of the state, it contributed to=20
blackouts in Northern California. Earlier this year, the state PUC ordered =
an=20
upgrade to the transmission system.=20
The federal Western Area Power Administration, which manages hydropower=20
projects in the Central Valley, is conducting studies for the Path 15=20
expansion and will be holding environmental impact hearings in Coalinga on=
=20
Aug.=20
27 and in Los Banos on Aug. 28. More information is available on the agency=
's=20
Web site at www.WAPA.gov <http://www.WAPA.gov>.=20
The agency will review the proposals and make a recommendation to Abraham.=
=20
The proposals were made by, among others, PG&E Corp., Calpine Corp. and=20
Mirant Corp, the Western Area Power Administration said.=20
The expansion plans calls for a third transmission line and other upgrades=
=20
that would permit an additional 1,500 megawatts of transmission capacity,=
=20
enough to power 1.5 million homes. Construction time is estimated at three =
to=20
four years and would cost $300 million.=20
The companies are expected to recapture their investment by adding a=20
surcharge on power transmitted over the new lines, Abraham said.=20
The expansion is likely to follow the same route identified in the hearings=
 a=20
decade ago, running in a 2,000-foot-wide corridor through the foothills wes=
t=20
of Interstate 5, mainly over privately owned ranchland.=20
In a related development, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., hailed an agreement=
=20
between the House and Senate to spend $1.3 million for the new environmenta=

Figures show state lost big on extra power=20

BY JOHN WOOLFOLK=20

Mercury News=20


State figures show California may have lost about $14 million this month=20
selling surplus electricity for less than it cost.=20
The Mercury News disclosed last week that some power was being sold at a=20
loss. But the new figures provide the first indication of just how much=20
excess power the state bought in its desperate effort to avoid blackouts --=
=20
and how cheaply some of that power was sold when it turned out not to be=20
needed.=20
A Republican lawmaker said Monday the loss also shows Democratic Gov. Gray=
=20
Davis' energy policies are needlessly costing consumers.=20
``This whole thing is a mess,'' said Assemblyman John Campbell, R-Irvine, w=
ho=20
requested details of the state's surplus power sales. ``The government need=
s=20
to get out of the power business before it costs Californians even more=20
money.''=20
A state spokesman didn't dispute the $14 million figure outright but said i=
t=20
is an approximation based on average prices and that the actual loss probab=
ly=20
is less.=20
``It's a number I'm sure he likes very much, but it's definitely an estimat=
ed=20
number, and it could be far lower,'' said Oscar Hidalgo, spokesman for the=
=20
state Department of Water Resources.=20
Campbell responded that the loss also could be higher.=20
The state has spent $415 million on power so far this month.=20
State officials last week confirmed that cool weather and consumer=20
conservation have left California holding more power than it needs. The=20
revelation was a stunning turnaround for a state that months ago was paying=
=20
top dollar for power, expecting shortages this summer.=20
Price that was paid=20
The state bought 3.5 million megawatt-hours of electricity for July at an=
=20
average price of $118 per megawatt-hour, according to a response Friday by=
=20
the Department of Water Resources to Campbell's inquiry. The state has sold=
=20
178,000 surplus megawatt-hours in July at an average price of $37, the=20
department said.=20
Based on those average prices, the state paid $21 million for the surplus=
=20
power, which it sold for $6.5 million -- $14.5 million less than it cost.=
=20
A more precise calculation of the state's loss is difficult because purchas=
ed=20
power is acquired at different times and prices and pooled as a=20
``portfolio.''=20
Purchases included long-term contracts that averaged $138 per megawatt-hour=
=20
as well as cheaper spot-market buys.=20
State officials last week said they were selling surplus at $15 to $30 a=20
megawatt-hour, while some traders cited unconfirmed sales as low as $1.=20
Hidalgo noted that the surplus sales represent just 5 percent of California=
's=20
July purchases, which totaled $415 million. The $6.5 million from sales wil=
l=20
help lower the state's power bill, he said, adding that utilities routinely=
=20
sell some extra electricity.=20
``Despite the fact that we're in somewhat of a surplus, any power-buying=20
operation in the world is going to have to plan for these types of=20
situations,'' Hidalgo said. ``It's not unique, and in fact it's normal=20
operating procedure for any utility.''=20
Other Western utilities, including Portland General Electric in Oregon, hav=
e=20
said they, too, are selling some surplus power at a loss and describe it as=
 a=20
cost of doing business.=20
The suppliers buying the state's surplus electricity on the cheap include t=
he=20
big out-of-state energy companies that the governor has called price-gougin=
g=20
``snakes.'' Among them are Duke Energy, Dynegy Power and Marketing, El Paso=

Power Services, Mirant, Reliant Energy and Williams Energy.=20
`Best bid' taken=20
Hidalgo said the state took the best offers it could find.=20
``It's only reasonable to get the best bid you can,'' he said.=20
Campbell said the $14 million loss is troubling because ratepayers or=20
taxpayers will have to cover the cost, whereas a private utility could be=
=20
forced to eat the expense if regulators determined it was unreasonable.=20
State officials say what's more important is that the overall cost of power=
=20
is dropping, from an average daily tab of $64 million in May to $25 million=
=20
this month, in part because the state has so much power.=20
