Internet Daily for Thursday, June 7, 2001

7-Eleven expands in-store Web test

Check cashing, wiring money and other financial transactions have
become easier with the introduction of Web-enabled kiosks at
three dozen 7-Eleven stores in Florida's Fort Myers and Naples
area.

The company eventually expects to offer bill payment, event
ticketing, travel directions and road maps through the
proprietary terminals. Fort Myers and Naples were chosen to be a
test market because there already is a strong demand for 7-Eleven
stores' financial products, like money orders, said market
manager Jim Summers.

Depending on the test, 7-Eleven expects to place kiosks in
additional stores nationally within six months. Because the kiosk
is Web enabled, 7-Eleven could also offer branch banking, vehicle
registration, issuance of airline tickets and in-store pickup of
items bought online. A similar test has been under way at 58
stores in Texas. American Express has signed up to be the primary
provider of ATM services, Western Union Financial Services will
provide money order and money transfer transactions and Equifax
has agreed to handle the check-cashing.

Orbitz start travels a rough road

Highly promoted Orbitz.com found itself unable to handle the
traffic. Call centers for the airline-owned ticket site were
understaffed for the demand that greeted its launch Monday, a
fiber-optic cable failed in Chicago, slowed operations and the
site went off  line Wednesday night for upgrades, according to
The Wall Street Journal. "The deluge of customers really has
exceeded our expectations," said Roland Jacobs, chief marketing
officer. The number of customer service agents will be doubled to
200, he said. CEO Jeffrey Katz announced that during the site's
three-month trial, it sold $4 million worth of tickets. Monday
and Tuesday it did $4.5 million in business, a level not expected
until late July.

Napster, the movie

Liberty Media Group's Starz Encore unit is working on a movie
about Napster. A spokesman for the movie programmer confirmed
discussions are under way, Reuters reported. However, there is no
commitment for production of a movie, yet. A Los Angeles-based
writer is developing a screenplay for the project, and has been
interviewing people who have been associated with the company and
its founder Shawn Fanning. He called his song-swapping program
Napster, which was his nickname in high school because of his
curly hair.

Napster said Thursday it has contracted with Loudeye Technologies
to protect copyrighted music downloaded from the service. Loudeye
provides digital "fingerprints" for files, and will be part of
Napster's effort to remove copyrighted content from its service.
"Loudeye's fingerprints and metadata will ultimately help us
track millions of unique music files on our service, so we can
fulfill our commitment to compensate artists, songwriters, music
publishers and record companies," said Napster CEO Hank Barry.

Net pharmacy sales to be probed

A House of Representatives committee will investigate the risks
of imported pharmaceuticals. Among witnesses to be heard are the
parents of Todd Rode of Athens, Ga., who died after taking drugs
he ordered online. Other witnesses scheduled to testify before
the Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations subcommittee
include several drug company executives and a representative from
the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy.
