My brain is fried.  Can you remember what kind of opt in-out thing the CPUC 
had?  I remember it being a fiasco.

Sue,
 Frank Rishe has ask me to search for the states that have allowed customers 
to opt in or out of marketing lists. Does California require utilities to 
offer a customer the opportunity to decide on who they want to market to them 
for energy services? If so did we take a position on it?

 Thank you so very much,
 Lynnette
