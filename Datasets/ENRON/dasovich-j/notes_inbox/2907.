Fellow Evening MBA Students (old and new),

Cindy Best and I would like to introduce ourselves as your new Social
Chairs for the Evening MBA Association.  Now that we've all survived the
latest year (or the application process for you new Admits), it's time to
PARTY!!  The title "Summer Vacation" lost its meaning to most of us once we
got "regular" jobs.  We're going to bring that feeling of summer vacation
back to you - even if you are working full time.  We're going to organize
for you and your families many events during the summer to help you make the
most of your "vacation".

For those not able to commit any serious blocks of time to your fellow
classmates, we will be organizing monthly happy hours at different locations
around the Bay Area for brief but fun gatherings.  The locations are not yet
set, and we welcome any suggestions you may have for meeting places.  The
dates will be as follows (sorry North Bay - you're just
too far out there!):

Date Event
Fri 6/08 Happy Hour of the Month in SF - Location TBD
Fri 7/06 Happy Hour of the Month in South Bay - Location TBD
Fri 8/03 Happy Hour of the Month in East Bay - Location TBD

For those of you looking to broaden your horizons and participate in some
real fun activities, we have some trips on the burner such as: a 4th of July
fireworks/concert extravaganza at Concord Pavilion, a weekend camping trip,
and others.  As these events and dates become firm, we will send out more
information.  We don't want to overload you immediately, after all ... this
is your vacation!

Our first event, however, is set and we would like to get some RSVP's of
those interested.  It's the musical "Oliver" at the top of Mt. Tam
Amphitheatre on Sunday, June 17th.  This is an outdoor summer performance
and an all day event where you pack in your own lunch and enjoy the musical
in a relaxing Sunday afternoon.  This is a great way to spend Father's Day
with your family!  Concert-goers are bused in from parking lots near the 101
in Mill Valley.  At the end of the day, the event organizers will either bus
you directly back to your car, or take back all your gear for you, which
frees you up to hike down Mt. Tam (optional).  At the end of your optional
hike, the buses pick you up from the end of your hike and take you back to
your car and gear.  It is a great summer event which takes full advantage of
living in SF with your classmates and families.  If you want to check out
more information on it, the website for it is www.mountainplay.org and the
number to buy tickets is(415) 383-0155.

Cost:   $24/adult; $17/junior(age 4-17)
Car Pool RSVP: send an email to Tony by June 8th (tai@haas.berkeley.edu)

To minimize complications in purchasing and delivering tickets, you will
need to purchase tickets individually.  We recommend purchasing the tickets
no later than next week.  Please RSVP with your interest and if you are
interested in car pooling, indicate your location.  We will follow up with
additional details, which are dependent on the group size.

Well, let the summer fun begin!!  Look forward to hearing from you.

Cindy Best and Tony Tai
