TO:?????AD HOC GROUP ON THE ELECTRICITY CRISIS

Assemblyman Joe Nation put a bill in the hopper Friday, January 26th, which 
he believes is congruent with our thinking (see attached).? He is seeking our 
comments and possible endorsements.

Please send your comments directly to Joe Nation at <joe@joenation.com>, and 
let me know whether you believe we should work with him and consider 
endorsing his bill.

Thanks,
David Teece
