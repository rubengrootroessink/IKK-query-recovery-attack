Just a reminder regarding all of the high-tech recruiting activity
taking place this week.  Where noted, please sign-up in BearTracks
if you plan to attend.

By the way, the correlation between the sign-ups and
the actual attendees has been inconsistent so far this year. It really
helps the companies regarding space and food planning as well as how many
reps to send.  Please sign up if you plan to attend and remove yourself
if your plans change. The system allows you to sign up up to one day before
the
event.

Thanks,
Rich Wong
Account Manager, Technology
Haas Career Center

>
Brian Stone, Haas '98 and Director of Product Marketing, Wireless Products

> Siebel means it. At Siebel, we believe that if our customers are
> completely satisfied, the company's success will follow. Siebel employees
> will drop everything to make sure our customers are happy. All Siebel
> employees, from sales people to VP's, have incentives in place to ensure

> marketing driven organization, not a technology driven one.
>

> largely due to our ability to retain our small-company atmosphere. Each
> Haas MBA has been given the tools, responsibility, and independence to
> make a difference at Siebel, and to have a tremendous impact on the
> success of the company.  We are hiring in three areas:
>
> * Product Managers lead Siebel's on going process to define, produce
> and improve its world class web-based enterprise applications.  A Product
> Manager at Siebel is the general manager for his/her product, responsible
> for the driving the definition, launch and ongoing revenues.

> Partners and ensure Siebel Systems and the Partner meet agreed-upon
> business objectives in terms of revenue, product delivery, and market

> developing and preparing monthly/quarterly reporting packages and working
> with senior management to define key performance indicators.
>
> Siebel is redefining the rules of business. Come out and talk with us
> about how we do it.
