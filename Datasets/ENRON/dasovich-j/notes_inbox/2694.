versions=20
for an Internet company, publicly traded firm The Cobalt Group said it woul=

become a private company with buyout assistance from Warburg Pincus, one of=
=20
its original venture investors. The Seattle-based company provides Web site=
s=20
and services to online auto dealers and went public in August 1999. The dea=
l=20
is structured as a merger with a shell affiliate of Warburg Pincus, which m=
ay=20
put as much as $35 million into the deal, according to managing director Gr=
eg=20
Back. Shareholders will receive $3.50 in cash for each share of common stoc=
k=20
they own. Shares held by Warburg Pincus, about 46% of the company, will not=
=20
be converted in the merger, but some ten million shares representing half t=
he=20
company are outstanding. The deal has been in the works for several weeks a=
nd=20
was an "unsolicited bid" by Warburg Pincus, said John W.P. Holt, The Cobalt=
=20
Group's president and CEO. Mr. Holt owns 3% of the company's shares and wil=
l=20
remain as its executive. After a special committee of independent directors=
=20
reviewed and recommended the offer, The Cobalt Group's board of directors=
=20
voted unanimously to accept the deal. The transaction is still subject to=
=20
shareholders' approval and SEC review, and will not be completed until=20
September. Some aspects of the deal have not been finalized. Mr. Holt said =
he=20
could not comment on whether Chicago-based First Analysis, The Cobalt Group=
's=20
original venture backer and a continued shareholder in the company, would=
=20
sell off its holdings or retain an equity stake. First Analysis, which hold=
s=20
a board seat and voted in favor of the deal, could not be reached for=20
comment. Mr. Holt said The Cobalt Group's employees were likely to remain=
=20
shareholders but those terms too have yet to be determined. Mr. Back said=
=20
that until the transaction is closed, he would not comment on why Warburg=
=20
Pincus initiated the deal or how The Cobalt Group might benefit from being =
a=20
private company. Recently, several venture firms, including Charter Growth=
=20
Capital and Patricof & Co. have expressed interest in public-to-private=20
conversions of tech companies, noting that good deals are available for=20
companies that have sound business models but either went public too soon o=
r=20
are in sectors out of favor with the market. But until now no venture firm=
=20
has executed such a deal for an Internet company. The Cobalt Group is not=
=20
profitable and does not expect to have positive cash-flow from revenues unt=
il=20
late this year or early next. The company has seven business units and 630=
=20
employees in five offices around the country. Mr. Holt declined to comment =
on=20
whether the company would return to the public market in the future or be=
=20
acquired. He did say his job "feels a lot more secure today than it did a=
=20
week ago," and said the company's business plan will remain unchanged.
