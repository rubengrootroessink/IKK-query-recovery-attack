Governor's myths

We have known for some time that Gray Davis is a much better fundraiser and
political spin doctor than he is a Governor, but lately he is taking the
spin way too far. He is so desperate to find villains with whom he can
deflect focus from his own record that he continues to ignore facts. Here is
my effort to set the record straight on several of the Governor's, and his
lackeys, recent 
pronouncements on energy and the budget. 
Energy:
MYTH:  "All Texans are evil"
His spokesman said, "Anywhere they wear cowboy hats, they probably have
handkerchiefs across their face because they are robbing us blind." 
Why he said it: George Bush is from Texas and is a convenient scapegoat.
FACT: Only 2 of the 12 largest energy suppliers to California are from Texas
and they provide only 9% of the state's energy use.  

MYTH:  "Private power generators charged California the most"
Governor Davis said, "What's going on here, pure and simple, is
unconscionable price-gouging by the big energy producers."
Why he said it: Polls show that it is easier to blame power generators for
the energy crisis than anyone else. FACT: The private company power
generators charged substantially lower prices over the last few months for
energy than the public agencies.  In fact, documents recently released
reveal that Enron and Mirant averaged $181 and $225 per megawatt while LADWP
and Sacramento Municipal averaged $292 and $330 for energy sold to the state
during the first quarter of this year.  

MYTH:  "Power companies manipulated prices" 
Governor Davis said,  "Their testimony could be the "smoking gun" that
demonstrates there was improper manipulation of California's electricity
market."  
Why he said it: another way to say, "its not my fault, its their fault"
FACT: Duke energy shut its plant down because it was ordered to, in order to
balance the grid, by the California ISO, an entity overseen entirely by
Davis appointees. 
Budget:
MYTH:  "Republicans want to cut education spending"
A lead education appointee said, "We feel very strongly that agreeing to
that would put us in a position where children would lose." Why it was said:
he needs to think of something to justify his tax increase. FACT:
Republicans have never proposed cuts in education out of the current budget.
We have instead proposed reducing pork, entirely new or expanded 
programs, and cutting funded but vacant bureaucratic positions. 

MYTH:  "The $1.2 billion sales tax increase is not a tax increase"
The Governor said, "They've just invented this argument about a tax
increase. It's just nonsense. It's not a tax increase." 
Why he said it: he wants to maintain the illusion of being a fiscal
conservative FACT: One year ago, when the sales tax was cut, Davis had a
news conference announcing "This tax decrease will benefit every
Californian.  It will put even more of our prosperity in the hands of those
who created it in the first place - the taxpayers of this State." Now, when
the same tax goes up, it is not a tax increase? 
I will let you figure out for yourself whether or not these myths are indeed
myths -- I only hope that you won't be using the Governor's statements for
your facts.

Until next week, that's all for this week.
