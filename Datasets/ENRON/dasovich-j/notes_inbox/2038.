Hi Jeff,

I hope you had a good Thanks Giving with no power emergencies. I would also
like to follow up to see if you had an opportunity to get in touch with the
Data Center people within Enron? We had discussed the possibility of
coordinating a presentation for them. Along this line, I think it would be
equally as valuable to meet with your Service Provider group. As I mentioned
during our meeting Cambira is currently looking for market/customer
validation. Currently, we are involved in Series B funding and are in
contact with several very interested VCs. And this is where some validation
and a spokesperson would be most beneficial to us.

At present Ariba has validated our technology and their Director of Global
Network Operations has agreed to be a spokesperson for this phase in
Cambira's evolution. In fact, we are discussing a potential joint
development effort for service integration with them. We are hoping to
secure similar support from Enron, and this is really where I would like to
direct desire. I know your schedule is very busy and I appreciate your
consideration and hope to further collaborate with Enron to help realize the
value we can bring to your organization.

I look forward to speaking with you at your earliest convenience and hope we
can be of mutual benefit to each other.

Best regards,

John Protzel
