Looks good.  I wouldn't stress the MOU, but would rather focus on the 
"melding" of alot of good ideas.  The Investigation concession comes from

Basics of Proposal
Something akin to the MOU (that adequately addresses the solvency issue, for 
the IOUs, the State and QFs), but WITHOUT the transmission component
Direct Access for ALL customers, transitioning to a core/noncore market 
structure in 18-24 months (this can be accomplished without stranding CDWR's 
contracts)
Concessions
 -IOUs (MOU modifications)
 -Generators (past due amounts)
 -investigations
Package to finance the deal (bond issuance backed by rate increases to permit 
securitization)
