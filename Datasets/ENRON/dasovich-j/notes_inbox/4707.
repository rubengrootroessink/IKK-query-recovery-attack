Subject: FW: workshop  notice



Attached  for your information is an April 17 Notice of Workshop to Discuss 
California  Natural gas Infrastructure issued by the Energy Division.? The 
Energy  Division has scheduled the workshop to gather information on and 
obtain analyses  of the status of California's natural gas transmission and 
storage capacity and  the adequacy of that capacity to deliver gas to 
California in the  future.

The  Energy Division is requesting that PG&E, SoCalGas, and SDG&E make  
personnel and resources available to discuss and address the status of their 
gas  systems,? the adequacy of serving demand, and the future adequacy to 
meet  demand over the near -term (next year), mid-term (2-5 years) and 
long-term (over  5 years).?? The notice also mentions that the Commission is 
concerned  over the adequacy of the 2000 CGR, particularly the electric 
generation forecast  and requests that the utilities be prepared to bring to 
the workshop the most  recent and up-to-date EG forecast and address gas 
demand from new power  projects.

I've  been told that this request is coming through the Energy Division from 
the  President Lynch's office and is in response to legislative concerns over 
natural  gas infrastructure development.
