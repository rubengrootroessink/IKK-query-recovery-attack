Hi Folks,
          I am planning on organizing a volleyball/
      BBQ party at one of the parks in Sunnyvale
      on Saturday September 30. I will setup
      the volleyball and get the BBQ going. Each
      of us can bring in food and drinks.

      We could start around noon and play till
       4pm or 5pm ...

      Please reply *only* to me if you are interested.

       mailto:viswanat@haas.berkeley.edu

      - thanks,
      - som
