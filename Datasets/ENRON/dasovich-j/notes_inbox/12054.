Here is a preliminary draft of the letter to Dunn.  I have NOT been able to
assimilate and insert the press materials I got from Jeff this morning.  I
will be back from a commissioner meeting at noon California time and can
assist in further editing at that time.  I do believe that some of the press
material can be helpful.  Please send comments back by email.  I can be
reached by cell phone for part of the time during the next 90 minutes.  Mike
