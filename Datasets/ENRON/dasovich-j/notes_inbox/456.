All,
A few of you might have been testifying at the FERC hearings in San Diego, I
know Jeff was, so you know that most people wanted FERC to "do something."  
The
silver lining in that proposal is that our conference becomes more important.

Lee has decided on 12:30  to 6 pm on Monday November 13 so you can tell any
speakers you are inviting.  I think that's the best choice because it more
interesting to more people, and if they can do presidential debates in 2 hours
we should be able to address these issues in 6 hours.

Note that we have competition with another conference, see below.  We should 
be
able to get better, higher profile speakers.  We need to get a list soon so we
can send out advertisements.  Please send updates to Lee and me.  Expect 
another
message asking for reactions to a proposed next set of speakers to invite.  If
you want to be on a voluntary conference call addressing the next speakers,
followed by an even more optional discussion on logistics with Heather, tell 
me
if Monday 9/18 at 5pm EDT/2 pm Pacific works for you.

Lee, if you want to send this to the other potential sponsors you're talking 
to,
feel free.

Thanks!
Rob
