HiJeff-- This is the new report I mentioned yesterday.

To quote an old Grateful Dead song, "I need a miracle, every day..." 

Peace, vjw

Colleagues, below is Eric Hirst's cover note and draft of the DSM
research funded by the Project.? Eric also had EEI funding to use
on the study.? I don't plan to include the study on our
conference call agenda -- because I will not have time to read it
-- so please plan to review it and get back to Eric or me by Nov
17 if possible.? Thanks.

Dear Terry and Jim,

Here is the draft report Brendan Kirby and I prepared for EEI and the Project 
for a Sustainable FERC Energy Policy, Retail-Customer Participation in 
Bulk-Power Markets. We find that "Permitting and encouraging retail customers 
to respond to dynamic prices will improve economic efficiency, discipline 
market power, improve reliability, and reduce the need to build new 
generation and transmission facilities." The report gives several examples of 
recent programs and explains the many obstacles that prevent widespread 
adoption of these programs.

I hope you can review the draft and send me your comments (suggested 
additions, deletions, and revisions) by Monday, November 27. 

I am sending the report to about 50 people including the following 
"environmentalists" Eric Blank, Steve Nadel, Rich Cowart, Dave Moskovitz, 
Bill Marcus, and Art Rosenfeld. Feel free to send the draft to others you 
think might be willing to review it. 

Thanks for the help.

Eric
