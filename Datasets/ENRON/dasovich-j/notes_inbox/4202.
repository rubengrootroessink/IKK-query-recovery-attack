Jeff,
FYI - I saw the following news item and contacted EES to inquire why we 
weren't mentioned in the press release as Macerich is an EES customer.  
Apparently, it was going to be a joint press release by EES and Macerich, but 
the governor's office had other thoughts on the matter and we were taken 
out.  The nerve!

Governor Davis: California's Summer Depends on Conservation

The only way for California to make it through the summer
without blackouts is to cut electricity demand by 10 percent,
Governor Gray Davis announced last week. In a live
address, the governor reiterated the need to save energy in
the state. "Conservation is our best short-term weapon
against blackouts and price-gouging," said Governor Davis.

One company responding to the Governor's request is the
Macerich Company, one of the largest owners and operators
of shopping malls in the United States. While taking
immediate action to cut energy use by roughly 5 percent in
its California malls, the company is also committed to
decreasing energy use at its more than 40 malls across the
country. Macerich anticipates average energy savings of
15 percent through such projects as the installation of high-
efficiency air-conditioning units, thereby saving at least
30 million kilowatt-hours per year. The company is giving
first priority to upgrades at its California properties. See the
