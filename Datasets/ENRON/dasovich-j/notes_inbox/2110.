Jeff,

I have picked the names the past couple of names and would LOVE it if you
would pick.  (Just go ahead and give yourself Mike--mum's the word).

I would be happy to have Christmas dinner here.  We certainly have the space,
we are sort of the halfway point, etc.  And if you would help cook, that
would be really great. Let me just run it by Mike.

I gave Beth and John Bentivoglio a couple of ideas for Katie and Michael via
e-mail yesterday. There is some risk of duplicates but I asked Beth to let me
know what they decide to get so I can let you know too.  One idea for Katie
is bood 5 or 6 of the Narnia chronicles. Then she can complete the set.

Michael likes lego and k-nex toys and doesn't really have any.  Sports things
are always good too (although I don't have any great ideas). We could use a
decent basketball. We have small footballs.  I'll try and come up with other
ideas.
