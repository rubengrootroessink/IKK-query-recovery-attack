		 Subject: Governors update

Last night Ken Lay and I attended an RGA(Republican Governors Association) 
business forum/reception at the Governor's mansion in Denver Colorado.  
Governor attendees were Tom Ridge (PA), John Rowland (CT), Bill Owens (CO) 
and Jim Geringer (WY).  Another notable attendee was Corbin McNeill, CEO of 
Exelon.  It turned out that just about the entire discussion centered around 
energy and they strongly stated that the RGA is going to be very active in 
the western energy issues.  

Strategically this is good for us.  Although the WGA was the vehicle for the 
past 2 months (Kempthorne and Geringer are the chair/vice chair), it is now 
clear that the leadership of the RGA (Ridge, Rowland) will be helping the 
"steer the ship".  Although not talked about publically, I had a conversation 
with one of the governor's staffers (Scott Celley from Hull's office), and he 
is likely going to be the RGA policy guy on this effort,  having direct and 
daily contact with the Cheney energy team.  Paul and I have developed a 
relationship with him and he is going to be looking to us for further 
support/info/talking points etc.

Lastly, it is important to note that Corbin McNeill was singing exactly the 
same song as us on the price caps and western issues.   Additionally,  Mr. 
Lay asked him point blank--twice in fact--if he was for full and open non 
discriminatory access to the transmission system and he stated that he was.
