Lodi just says no to powers that be: Four times since March, the city kept=
=20
the lights on as other towns went dark.
By Stuart Leavenworth
Bee Staff Writer=20
(Published May 29, 2001)

LODI -- In this old farm town, where ferment is largely confined to wine=20
bottles, leaders are staging a Boston Tea Party against California's energy=
=20
crisis.=20
Lodi, population 57,000, is refusing to participate in the rolling blackout=
s=20
that have swept across California. Four times since March, Lodi's electric=
=20
utility has snubbed the state's power managers and kept its lights on while=
=20
others went dark.=20
The rock band Creedence Clearwater Revival once derided Lodi as a=20
conservative backwater, but now, this town is leading an unlikely revolt th=
at=20
is being picked up by others statewide.=20
"Lodi has something of an independent streak," said Steve Mann, a former ci=
ty=20
councilman in Lodi and one of many residents who support the city's utility=
.=20
"It doesn't make sense that we should participate in blackouts when we have=
=20
done everything we can to make sure we can avoid that."=20
So far, Lodi has the only utility in the state to openly defy an on-the-spo=
t=20
call for blackouts. They did so twice in March, then twice again this month=
.=20
This week, however, Riverside's utility said it, too, would not participate=
=20
in forced outages, and leaders of some other "munis" may follow suit.=20
Worried about a political snowball, Gov. Gray Davis met with leaders of the=
=20
munis last week, but refused to exempt them from further blackouts. If that=
=20
happened, the state's power managers would be unable to spread blackouts to=
=20
25 percent of the state's households, putting the brunt on other parts of t=
he=20
state.=20
"I'm sympathetic," said David Freeman, the governor's top energy adviser an=
d=20
a former leader of municipal utilities in Sacramento and Los Angeles. But=
=20
Freeman, speaking with uncharacteristic guardedness, said it may not be=20
practical "to separate out utilities that are an integral part of the grid.=
"=20
The self-proclaimed "wine grape capital of the world," Lodi would seem an=
=20
unlikely hotbed for dissent. Creedence Clearwater once bemoaned being "stuc=
k=20
in Lodi." Instead of being offended by the song, many residents are glad=20
their town isn't inhabited by a bunch of long-haired rabble-rousers.=20
Even so, Lodi likes to defy convention when it comes to protecting its own.=
=20
Two years ago, the city started waging battle against big insurance compani=
es=20
that didn't want to pay to clean up toxic substances from local businesses=
=20
that had trickled into water supplies.=20
In recent years, Lodi has spent millions sprucing up its once-dilapidated=
=20
downtown, which soon will be crowned by a new 12-screen cineplex.=20
But the town's biggest source of pride is its taxpayer-owned utility, which=
=20
started in the 1890s when two brothers, Ed and Fred Carey, launched a water=
=20
and electric utility. In 1910, they sold it to the city of Lodi for $35,000=
.=20
Now, the utility provides $4 million to the town's coffers every year, with=
 a=20
$30 million annual budget.=20
Like many other municipal utilities in Northern California, Lodi has more=
=20
power lined up than it needs, but is dependent on Pacific Gas and Electric=
=20
Co. to deliver that power to its doorstep.=20
As a result, "Lodi's relationship with PG&E has been tenuous throughout its=
=20
history," said Mann. One point of contention is the interconnection agreeme=
nt=20
among PG&E, Lodi and the town's fellow members in the Northern California=
=20
Power Agency.=20
PG&E officials say the agreement requires Lodi to shed power during any pow=
er=20
shortfall. But Lodi contends the pact obligates the utility to impose=20
blackouts only during "physical emergencies," such as a wind storm that=20
knocks out transformers.=20
"We don't see any compelling reason why Lodi should have to participate in=
=20
rolling blackouts," said Alan Vallow, director of the city's utility. "You=
=20
want me to turn customers off when we have the capacity to keep them on? Th=
at=20
doesn't work for me."=20
During a statewide call for blackouts, PG&E conceivably could just switch o=
ff=20
power for Lodi if the city's utility didn't heed the call voluntarily. But=
=20
Vallow doubts PG&E would take such a step. "That would be pretty extreme," =
he=20
said.=20
An engineer who used to work for Los Angeles' utility, Vallow has become=20
"something of a folk hero" because of his stance, said Mann. Vallow is=20
especially popular with Lodi's canneries, which need reliable power in the=
=20
summer to pack fruit before it rots in the field. And most Lodites "are 100=
=20
percent behind Mr. Vallow," said Marie Saunders, a longtime local resident.=
=20
On the other hand, Lodi's City Council hasn't officially endorsed Vallow's=
=20
decision, giving it an out should PG&E or state officials seek revenge.=20
"If we weren't supportive, we would let Alan know," said Alan Nakanishi, th=
e=20
mayor of Lodi. "On the other hand, if we do get retribution, we may say to=
=20
Al, 'Hey, what is all this about?' "=20
So far, PG&E hasn't threatened any action against Lodi, but experts say the=
=20
town is venturing into murky legal territory.=20
"It is a legal question that hasn't been resolved," said John Fistolera,=20
legislative director of the Northern California Power Agency, a group of=20
municipal utilities that includes Lodi.=20
The Sacramento Municipal Utility District, which is not part of NCPA, also=
=20
has taken a cautious approach. Earlier this year, at least one SMUD board=
=20
member recommended the utility follow Lodi's example. But the idea was=20
dropped amid fears that SMUD, being a bigger utility, could face a legal=20
fight that PG&E wouldn't mount against little Lodi.=20
"I really admire what Lodi has done," said Linda Davis, a SMUD board member=
.=20
"But I don't want to end up in court, and I fear SMUD would end up in court=
."=20
Instead of an open rebellion, SMUD has joined the Southern California town =
of=20
Vernon and 13 other cities in appealing to the Federal Energy Regulatory=20
Commission. They want FERC to exempt them from blackouts ordered by the=20
state's grid manager, the Independent System Operator.=20
ISO officials argue that "load shedding" from the municipal utilities is=20
vital for maintaining balance on the grid during shortfalls. But SMUD and t=
he=20
other municipalities say they shouldn't be penalized for lining up power=20
reserves that have eluded the state's big utilities, especially with the=20
state facing dozens of blackouts this summer.=20
"Like Vernon, SMUD has grave concerns over the prospect of sharply escalati=
ng=20
the number and duration of blackout occurrences directed by the ISO on a=20
grid-wise basis over the upcoming summer months," SMUD wrote to FERC.=20
Last week, the Riverside City Council voted to stop participating in=20
blackouts ordered by the ISO. Like Lodi, Riverside says its conservation=20
programs should be taken into account in ISO's attempts to deal with power=
=20
shortages.=20
Vallow says Lodi has done everything it can to help the state. In January,=
=20
the city complied with blackout orders, then purchased long-term contracts=
=20
that gave it a 40 percent surplus in power reserves.=20
To pay for those reserves, the utility increased customer rates by as much =
as=20
15 percent.=20
Since then, the city has sold excess power back to the state to help with=
=20
shortages. But Vallow also has told the state that Lodi will not participat=
e=20
in further blackouts.=20
Vallow calls it the "SET" program, which stands for "System, Electric suppl=
y=20
and Team."=20
"We've done everything the state should have done to avoid the crisis we ar=
e=20
in now," said Vallow. "We are SET."=20

Dan Walters: Debt dilemmas plague energy executives, ordinary workers alike


(Published May 29, 2001)=20
The Bible, in one of its many warnings to the faithful about incurring debt=

makes this pithy observation: "The rich rule over the poor and the borrower=

is servant to the lender."=20
Credit may have become the essential underpinning of a modern industrial=20
society, from the billions of dollars in operational financing arranged by=
=20
governments and corporations to the credit card transactions of everyday=20
consumers, but our uneasiness about debt continues.=20
California's two major utilities ran up more than $13 billion in debt to bu=
y=20
power at prices far higher than consumers were paying, until lenders cut of=
f=20
their credit. And the state government then stepped in and has incurred an=

additional $7.7 billion in debt -- with plans to nearly double its borrowin=
g=20
to over $13 billion -- to keep the lights burning. One utility has sought=

bankruptcy protection and another is on the verge; the state's heavy power=
=20
purchase debts have undermined its credit rating and its ability to finance=
=20
other spending.=20
While the governor and state legislators ponder these multibillion-dollar=

questions of debt, they also must decide what to do, if anything, about the=
=20
relatively tiny debts that poor Californians are incurring. The practices o=
f=20
so-called "payday lenders" and those making home-secured loans to the elder=

The "payday loan" business has mushroomed since being expressly authorized =

state, often replacing pawnbrokers as lenders of last resort.=20
Critics see the trade as legalized usury, in which cash-poor borrowers not=

=20
year -- and are forced, in effect, to roll over the loans week after week.=
=20
Sen. Don Perata, D-Alameda, is carrying a measure that would tighten up=20
payday loan practices, the latest in a long string of proposals that have=

the efforts of lenders and their lobbyists. Assemblyman Dario Frommer, D-Lo=
s=20
Angeles, meanwhile, is carrying a measure that lenders back as a compromise=
,=20
although it's been denounced by consumerists as a smoke screen.=20
A similar battle is being waged over what critics describe as "predatory=20
lending" by home loan subsidiaries of major banks. Consumer activists argue=

=20
opposition campaign and the fate of the bill is in doubt. Dunn and his=20
supporters need five of the six Democrats on the committee to vote for the=

creditworthiness?=20
They are not dissimilar to the questions that are being raised about the hu=

In power crisis, is there ray of light at end of murky tunnel?=20



By Ed Mendel=20
May 28, 2001=20
SACRAMENTO -- Is California, at long last, about to catch a break in the=20
electricity crisis, or will the cost of power this summer short-circuit the=
=20
state budget, forcing painful cuts?=20
Among the doom and gloom of blackout preparations last week, there were a f=
ew=20
faint flickers of hope.=20
Some prices for summer power have dropped. State power buyers smoothly=20
handled high loads during two hot days. A big generator, Mirant, unexpected=
ly=20
agreed to provide 500 megawatts through the summer at a reasonable price.=
=20
Davis administration officials are sticking with their forecast, derided by=
=20
some as a "hope and expectation," that the average price the state will pay=
=20
for non-contracted power will drop this summer.=20
"It's very doable," said Ray Hart, head of the power purchasing unit in the=
=20
state Department of Water Resources.=20
The forecast by Davis consultants expects the average of $346 per megawatt=
=20
hour paid by the state for non-contracted power in April through June to dr=
op=20
to $195 in July through September.=20
But skeptics fear that as heat drives up the demand for power, the state wi=
ll=20
get a double whammy -- soaring spot-market prices because of a regional pow=
er=20
shortage, and a series of disruptive and dangerous blackouts.=20
The state, in what Vice President Dick Cheney calls a "harebrained scheme,"=
=20
began buying power for utility customers in January after a failed=20
deregulation plan forced the utilities deep into debt.=20
The Davis administration notified the Legislature last Wednesday that in 10=
=20
days the state general fund will begin spending another $500 million=20
increment for power, bringing the total since January to $7.7 billion.=20
Now it's nervous time at the Capitol until the general fund is repaid by a=
=20
bond issue of up to $13.4 billion, which is expected to be issued in late=
=20
August and September and paid off by ratepayers over 15 years.=20
What if there is a snag? Or spending on power soars? State Controller=20
Kathleen Connell is predicting that the state will have to borrow more mone=
y=20
than planned, perhaps an additional $4 billion.=20
As for the flicker of hope, a reporter for a publication that tracks power=
=20
said prices at the Palo Verde hub, which serves Southern California, have=
=20
dropped significantly since April for deliveries in July through September.=
=20
"My personal opinion is, they probably won't get back up to where they were=
=20
during the highs," said Mike Wilczek of Platts Power Market Week.=20
Another journalist who tracks power prices, Arthur O'Donnell, editor of=20
California Energy Markets, sees no trend other than volatility.=20
"It depends largely on what the weather is," O'Donnell said. "The expectati=
on=20
is that August is going to be the ugly month, and that is being reflected i=
n=20
the future prices."=20
O'Donnell said he was encouraged that the state Department of Water=20
Resources, which lined up some power purchases in advance, handled=20
heat-driven high loads last Monday and Tuesday without declaring an=20
emergency.=20
"What it tells me is, DWR is learning its job," O'Donnell said.=20
The state is counting on an ad campaign and "sticker shock" from rate=20
increases to reduce power use this summer. And the amount of cheaper power=
=20
obtained through contracts, now less than half the total, is expected to=20
increase to about two-thirds in June through August.=20

"Keeping their heads down did nothing but leave the playing field open to=

The party opposes Davis' creation of a state power authority, with some=20

"America is built on a capitalist system -- not on socialization," said=20
Assembly Republican Leader Dave Cox, R-Fair Oaks. "Socialism has failed=20

Yet Assembly Republicans want to make it easier for San Diego County to=20

The board of the state authority is composed of appointed and elected=20

Assemblyman Mark Wyland, R-Escondido, who is pushing a San Diego utility=20
district, said he believes the difference is local control.=20
"People want to control their own energy destiny," he said. "They don't hav=

Davis chastised Republicans for putting ideology above pragmatism.=20
"They're very quick to say we need more supply, but when you have a measure=

that would lead to more supply, they quickly retreat to their ideological=
=20
point of view and refuse to be problem solvers," he said.=20
Republicans also opposed the Democrats' plan to replenish the state treasur=

for the money it has spent on buying power by floating a $13.4 billion bond=
=20
that would be repaid by ratepayers. They claimed that the bond was so large=

it was fiscally irresponsible.=20
Yet the Assembly Republicans' alternative plan would have led to massive=20

Democrats passed the bond plan anyway, but the Republicans' opposition=20

Republicans have also been hurt by their unwillingness to crack down on the=

By contrast, Cox opposes the tax, worrying that it will hurt the business=

them as "entrepreneurs trying to maximize profits."=20
A recent Assembly investigation into California's high natural gas prices=

The key Republican committee member, Assemblyman John Campbell, R-Irvine,=

"They're siding with Texas oil interests and Texas gas interests and that's=

going to get them in trouble," he said.=20
Republicans may also suffer from association with President Bush, who is=20

?????The hotel--which no longer offers lodging, just food and drink, and=20
plenty of it--is bustling these days with the roustabout energy of a Lone=
=20
Star construction camp. Just down the road, a mammoth electrical power plan=
t=20
is rising out of the sagebrush, its generators housed in four boxy building=
s=20
the size of airplane hangars.
?????It is one of six new major gas-fired power plants expected to be built=
=20
in Kern County over the next several years, an electrical construction boom=
=20
unmatched anywhere in California. Kern, which already has a large surplus o=
f=20
electricity, is cementing its place as California's energy capital, assumin=
g=20
far more than its share of the burden in recharging the state's drained pow=
er=20
supplies.
?????Over the next several years, the county will add nearly 5,000 megawatt=
s=20
of power to the statewide grid. That is more than California now imports, o=
n=20
average, from out-of-state suppliers. It's enough to supply about five=20
counties the size of Kern, which fills the dusty southern rim of the San=20
Joaquin Valley and has a population of 662,000.
?????In some parts of the state, a proposal to build a new power plant is a=
=20
call to throw up the barricades. In recent months, intense community=20
opposition has forced developers to pull back proposals to build major plan=
ts=20
in South Gate and San Jose, although Gov. Gray Davis has tried to revive=20
plans for the San Jose plant.
?????You don't hear a lot of not-in-my-backyard talk in Kern County.
?????"There should be power plants in everybody's backyard," said Paul Gipe=
,=20
chairman of the Kern chapter of the Sierra Club, which did not oppose any o=
f=20
the new plants. "If people are concerned about having too many power plants=
,=20
they should think twice when they flip on the light switch."
?????New, natural gas-fired power plants, Gipe reasoned, are relatively cle=
an=20
and will not add significantly to the county's serious air pollution=20
problems. Ideally, he said, they will allow the state to close some older,=
=20
dirtier plants that cause considerably more environmental damage.
?????If environmentalists don't oppose the plants, it's not too much of a=
=20
leap to guess that some people might be positively thrilled about them.
?????Just try, for instance, asking somebody in Taft, an oil center south o=
f=20
McKittrick. "It's more money coming into Kern County--that's the way I look=
=20
at it," said Pamela Dunlap, who runs a downtown thrift shop.

?????An Economy Rooted in the Oil Industry
?????She stood in the twilight outside her shop, on a street that embodies=
=20
many of the most attractive attributes of small town Americana--with one=20
small difference. Where some towns might have statues of their founders or=
=20
war heroes in prominent public places, Taft has erected small oil rigs and=
=20
other pieces of drilling machinery, a reminder of its economic roots.
?????That Kern County has stepped up as California's blackout-buster is,=20
perhaps, not surprising.
?????To begin with, there's geography. Kern stands astride California's maj=
or=20
north-south electrical transmission lines at precisely the spot at which th=
ey=20
divide between the service areas of Pacific Gas & Electric, which serves=20
Northern California, and Southern California Edison. That spot can be=20
pinpointed as the Midway substation, a vast jungle of humming wires,=20
transformers and circuit breakers that lies a short distance west of=20
Interstate 5 in the town of Buttonwillow.
?????Already, massive new circuit-breakers--they look like Frankenstein=20
helmets sprouting 5-foot-long sparkplugs--are being erected at Midway to=20
handle the power from two major plants that will be revving up in the comin=
g=20
months: PG&E National Energy's La Paloma plant, the one near McKittrick; an=
d=20
Edison Mission Energy's Sunrise plant, just south of Taft.
?????The county is served by two major natural gas pipelines, which will be=
=20
tapped to run the plants. In fact, Kern contains the state's largest known=
=20
reservoirs of natural gas.
?????Another of Kern's geographic advantages?
?????"You look around, and you'll see there aren't a lot of people living=
=20
around here," observed Stephen Whaley, who is overseeing construction of th=
e=20
Sunrise plant. In the surrounding hills, an orchard of oil rigs bobbed in t=
he=20
morning haze. Dirt roads cut crudely across the landscape, bisecting a=20
crisscross of steam pipes, fuel lines and electrical wires.
?????"This area is all about oil," Whaley said. Casting a glance at the=20
modular 560-megawatt plant rising behind him, he added with a wry smile, "Y=
ou=20
know, I guess you could look at this from the road, and you could make the=
=20
argument that it improves the looks."
?????The Sunrise plant, a relatively simple single-cycle plant, is expected=
=20
to fire up 320 megawatts of its total output by Aug. 1, a scant nine months=
=20
after construction began. The other plants--more complex and efficient=20
dual-cycle operations--will be opening over the next several years, assumin=
g=20
all receive final approval.
?????The lack of major opposition to the plants is, of course, another reas=
on=20
developers see Kern County as a good place to build. The county has long ha=
d=20
a more intimate relationship with energy--oil, gas, electricity--than most=
=20
places. To people here, the link between a natural gas well and a lightbulb=
,=20
or an oil derrick and a gas pedal, is neither theoretical nor especially=20
threatening. They're comfortable with energy.
?????Kern produces more crude oil than any other county in the United State=
s=20
outside Alaska. Property taxes from oil companies have helped build handsom=
e=20
new schools in Bakersfield, the county seat and largest city. The companies=
'=20
big payrolls have helped populate elegant subdivisions with names that soun=
d=20
vaguely Houstonian: Seven Oaks, River Oaks, Landmark Estates.
?????Which brings us to the Texas connection.
?????It's hard to overlook it, in a county that runs on oil and cotton and=

boasts a country music scene to rival Austin's. Conversations in the finer=

Bakersfield restaurants are filled with references to trips to Texas, of=20
colleagues in Midland and Odessa. A Bakersfield radio station was running a=

contest recently: The winners would be flown to a bull riding championship =
in=20
Houston.
?????Until December 1999, American Airlines offered direct jet service=20
between Bakersfield and Dallas. It stopped after Occidental Petroleum moved=
=20
its headquarters from Bakersfield to Houston.
?????This is a county where President Bush received more support in the=20
November election than he did in Texas, his home state. But then, Bush=20
already had a Bakersfield connection: He lived there briefly as a child whe=
n=20
his father, former President George Bush, worked in the Kern oil fields.
?????"You look at the topography around Bakersfield, and the county's moral=

and ethics--that predominantly conservative attitude that we have around=20
here--and you look at the oil, and you could be in Midland," said John Alle=

the general manager of Occidental of Elk Hills, which is developing a power=

plant in tandem with Sempra Energy of San Diego.
?????A lot of people in Kern County will tell you they don't mind being an=

energy farm for the state. It's a living, after all.
?????"It's good to be working at home," said Joe Ryan, a Bakersfield pipe=

welder who has spent years on the road seeking the heavy construction work=

that seemed to have vanished in his hometown. Now he's working at the La=20

beginning in December.
?????About 800 people are at work on the plant, and several hundred more wi=

others to build.
?????"This is a good job here, I tell you what," said Ryan, 47, who has bee=

banking his overtime on six 10-hour days a week--sometimes more.

?????County Sees Itself as 'Part of the Solution'
?????But there are some signs of simmering resentment, especially among=20

And people in Kern County are getting hit with the same spring-loaded=20

?????SACRAMENTO--Despite months of negotiations, Gov. Gray Davis' plan to=

effectively dead in the state Legislature, leaders of both houses now agree=

?????Not only has Davis failed to garner support for his more than $3-billi=

to fashion an alternative are also falling flat. As a result, any alternati=

proposal to rescue Edison will probably have to be approved on a party-line=

vote by Democrats.
?????The reasons are complex, according to legislators working to close the=

Edison deal, but ultimately come down to simple politics, and are emblemati=
c=20
of what has been a plodding, partisan response in the state Capitol to the=

energy crisis.
?????The stakes are high, because restoring Edison to financial health and=

requiring the utility to temporarily sell power at lower prices are linchpi=

of Davis' plan to get the state out of the business of buying electricity.
?????Nevertheless, leaders in the Legislature say Davis' approach has few=

backers.
?????"I don't think the governor's [plan] has support in either party in=20

issue is whether we can come up with something else, and I think we can."
?????Senate leader John Burton (D-San Francisco), who has been critical of=

the deal Davis and Edison put together from the outset, said it is certainl=

dead in the Legislature, but that a more far-reaching proposal may still=20
emerge.
?????"Hopefully, we will find a long-term solution" to the state's energy=
=20
mess, Burton said. The Edison deal alone "is not going to solve anything. I=
t=20
is not going to reduce rates, and it is not going to prevent blackouts."
?????Since January, California has authorized more than $7 billion in=20
taxpayer money to buy power for private utilities in order to avoid mass=20
blackouts. It is a perilous fiscal situation that has drained the state=20
budget and led to downgrades of the state's credit rating on Wall Street.
?????Lawmakers are wary of making an even greater blunder than they did in=
=20
1996, when they unanimously approved what is now widely considered to be a=
=20
botched scheme to deregulate electricity in California. In both the Assembl=

?????A core element of all Edison rescue programs being considered is a=20
proposal to use a chunk of customers' monthly electric bills to repay the=

appetizing as a suicide pill.

?????Consumer Activists Threaten Initiative
?????The deal only requires a majority vote, but without two-thirds approva=

?????Meanwhile, Democratic efforts to forge a bipartisan solution with=20

?????Sensing they were being frozen out of negotiations, Assembly Republica=

(R-Fair Oaks) said he had hoped to pursue a bipartisan solution, but,=20
"Regrettably, it appears that [the Legislature] is not moving in that=20

?????The Republicans' decision surprised and angered members of the "Plan B=

group say they are close to unveiling a complex counterproposal that could=

since Davis announced he had reached a deal with Edison executives to save=

?????The rescue deal Davis reached with Edison calls for the state to pay t=

?????From the minute it was announced, however, lawmakers from both parties=

WASHINGTON OUTLOOK
Bush Could Boost Green Power With Buying Power=20


By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, Times Staff Writer=20

?????Today, the south wall of the Energy Department's fortress-like=20
Washington headquarters is a fitting symbol for an agency that itself has=
=20
never quite established an identity: a 32,100-square-foot blank slab of=20
concrete.
?????Shortly before leaving office, however, the Clinton administration=20
awarded a Chicago architectural firm a contract to explore converting the=
=20
wall into something quite different: a vast solar array that would provide=
=20
much of the building's heat and power.
?????The firm--Solomon Cordwell Buenz & Associates--has produced a=20
spectacular design of a graceful, canopy-like Sun Wall that utilizes both=
=20
photovoltaic panels and hydronic systems, a liquid-filled vacuum tube that=
=20
warms with the sun's rays and can heat the building in winter. Now the firm=
=20
is working to estimate the cost of constructing its creation. "We think it=
=20
would certainly draw attention to this whole new type of energy," says Mart=
in=20
Wolf, one of the designers. "Which would be quite timely given where we are=
=20
as a nation."
?????The Sun Wall stands as a riveting symbol of Washington's potential to=
=20
advance the development of renewable energy through a tool that's received=
=20
almost no attention in the energy debate: the purchasing power of the feder=
al=20
government itself. Through all its departments and agencies, the federal=20
government spends about $8 billion a year on energy--probably more than any=
=20
other single consumer in the world. That buying power gives the government=
=20
enormous leverage to speed the growth of renewable energy sources such as=
=20
solar, wind, geothermal and biomass.
?????Today, all of these renewable sources (leaving aside hydropower) provi=
de=20
only 2% to 3% of the nation's electricity, mostly because they are too=20
expensive to compete with conventional sources. Renewables are in the same=
=20
Catch-22 as many new technologies: Because they are too expensive, they=20
cannot attract the sales that their makers need to both generate economies =
of=20
scale and invest in more advanced manufacturing techniques.
?????Government can break the logjam by providing a market that allows=20
renewable manufacturers to advance up the learning curve and lower the pric=
e=20
of their technologies to a level that makes them commercially competitive.
?????Washington has done precisely this before, most important with a produ=
ct=20
that has literally transformed modern life: the microchip at the heart of t=
he=20
computer revolution. The first microchips were much too expensive to attrac=
t=20
commercial customers, but in the early 1960s, both NASA (using the chips fo=
r=20
the Apollo space program) and the Defense Department (embedding the chips i=
n=20
nuclear weapons) provided a guaranteed market--buying the chips without=20
regard to cost.
?????As author T.R. Reid recounted in "The Chip," his history of the=20
microchip: "The government's willingness to buy chips in quantity at premiu=
m=20
prices provided the money the semiconductor firms needed to hone their skil=
ls=20
in designing and producing [the] circuits. . . . As experience taught ways =
to=20
solve the most common production problems, the cost of making a chip began =
to=20
fall."
?????Three years after the government first started buying, the cost fell f=
ar=20
enough that the microchip attracted its first commercial customers. Its bee=
n=20
a breakneck race to the future ever since.
?????An alliance of centrist House Democrats has sensibly proposed that=20
Washington do the same for renewables. Earlier this month, the House New=20
Democrat Coalition introduced legislation that would commit the federal=20
government to purchasing a fixed percentage of its power from renewable=20
sources; the bill also would provide grants and loans to encourage state=20
governments and nonprofit organizations to also buy green. "Today, you can'=
t=20
generate the revenue to make these technologies more commercially viable,"=
=20
says Rep. Adam Smith (D-Wash.), one of the bill's principal authors. "The w=
ay=20
to get around that is to use the market power of the federal government to=
=20
help create a market."
?????With little attention, former President Clinton already committed the=
=20
federal government to that course. In 1999, he signed an executive order=20
mandating that Washington expand its use of renewable energy; later, his=20
administration set a goal of obtaining 2.5% of its electricity from renewab=
le=20
sources by 2005, almost eight times more than today. Smith believes that go=
al=20
is already too low, largely because renewables are becoming more competitiv=
e=20
as conventional sources grow more expensive.
?????Even so, this initiative is already spurring new thinking. As part of=
=20
the overall plan, the Clinton administration committed to installing 20,000=
=20
solar systems on government facilities by 2010; by the time he left office,=
=20
2,000 were already in place.
?????"It's out in the national parks, where instead of having to string pow=
er=20
lines to remote buildings, they are putting up solar systems," says Dan=20
Reicher, the assistant secretary for energy efficiency and renewable energy=
=20
under Clinton. "There are several thousand units of naval housing in Hawaii=
=20
that are now using solar. They are being used at the Coast Guard Station in=
=20
Boston, a post office in Nantucket."
?????Another dramatic project is underway in Nevada. Shortly before Clinton=
=20
left office, his administration signed an agreement with a private consorti=
um=20
to lease part of an old nuclear test site in the desert northwest of Las=20
Vegas as a giant wind power facility that would be the nation's second=20
largest. Eventually the site is expected to provide power for California an=
d=20
Nevada and the Energy Department itself from 500 wind turbines.
?????President Bush hasn't tipped his hand entirely on leveraging governmen=

order--and the green power purchasing goal it includes.

and the existing members of the commission have shown doubts about whether=

?????Gov. Gray Davis described the state's actions--detailed in a set of=20
filings delivered Friday to FERC--as a "full frontal attack" on what he ter=

the commission's industry-friendly policies.
?????"This agency has failed its duties miserably," he said. "It's time for=

?????With the governor's backing, the California Public Utilities Commissio=

FERC's actions to date have failed "to extinguish the fire that is rapidly=

?????A second petition asks the federal government to revoke the rights of=

at whatever price the market will bear.
?????The companies' right to do so was granted by FERC three years ago, whe=

?????The state's filings and the evidence about wholesale prices they conta=

?????California's petitions also come the day that Bush won Senate=20

?????Since last June, after prices began to soar in California's partly=20

?????But its commissioners have declined to cap prices across the West's=20

?????But some economists have concluded that California's market is so flaw=

?????State officials have also faulted the federal plan for exempting=20

the average price had risen more than 700%, to $258 per megawatt-hour,=20

Police Support 48-Hour Alerts for Blackouts=20

?????Earlier this year, when widespread blackouts first began to roll their=

?????That was then.
?????This is now: On Friday, law enforcement officials throughout Southern=

California hailed a decision by Gov. Gray Davis to create an early-warning=

system that would give the public increasingly specific alerts during the 4=

news conference, where he was joined by senior officials of the California=

The governor announced his plan Thursday.
?????The governor's plan was also endorsed by 35 police chiefs from=20

Palm Springs.
?????Since the blackouts began, "one of the No. 1 issues has been the lack =

of the county police chiefs association.
?????What gives? What has changed since January, when officials from Southe=

California Edison insisted that they couldn't give more than five or 10=20

?????Richard Rosenblum, a senior vice president for Edison, said the utilit=

had canvassed law enforcement officials earlier this year. "The general vie=
w=20
at that time--and it certainly was not unanimous--was that for public safet=

reasons, it would be better not to release that information."
?????Since then, he said, "there's been a good deal more thinking . . . and=

that view has changed."
?????Melekian (whose city is served by its own utility, not Edison) said he=

heard that explanation before.
?????"I remember, when they were saying that, I had trouble finding anybody=

who had been canvassed," he said. "I certainly wasn't. Somebody may have=20

?????Were police worried about looting and burglaries in a blackout?
?????"We never were worried about that," Melekian said. With blackouts=20
lasting only about an hour in any one place and always occurring during=20
daylight, "we haven't seen any crime issues emerge and we don't anticipate=

?????Baca said he did have concerns, but they were erased Monday, when Davi=

?????"All of us were extremely relieved that . . . our fears about crime=20

?????Glendale isn't alone--bright lights can be seen after midnight at car=

dealerships throughout the area, including lots in Van Nuys and Thousand=20
Oaks. After-hours lights also were spotted this week at a Smart & Final in=

Venice, a lamp store in Studio City and a Goodyear Tires store in Westwood,=

where the manager said the lights stay on till 3 a.m.
?????"We are obligated to the corporate office to keep our lights on," said=

the tire store manager, who would not give his name. "We do what they tell=

us. I didn't even know a fine could be issued."
?????In San Francisco's Union Square, retailers and restaurants also keep=

their windows lit long after closing time, according to area merchants.
?????"If stores are cutting back, I haven't noticed. The heart of Union=20
Square looks the same. Everything is bright, everything is on," said Brando=

Koehl, manager of the Williams-Sonoma housewares store near Union Square.
?????The light-reduction order, signed by Davis on Feb. 1, called on "all=

California retail establishments" to "substantially reduce maximum outdoor=

the governor's office defined substantial as a 50% reduction in electrical=

lights or cutting the wattage.
?????Law enforcement honchos, including Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca=
,=20
promised to enforce the measure at a Feb. 1 news conference with Davis. Sin=

then, police have expressed confusion about the 50% rule and whether cities=

such as Glendale and Los Angeles that have been spared from blackouts must=

?????Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy David Cervantes said his agency is=

focused on street crime, not store lights.
?????"We aren't issuing citations," Cervantes said, although he said that=

?????Glendale Police spokesman Sgt. Rick Young said the late-night bright=

lights at the Brand Boulevard car dealerships aren't his problem. "We don't=

?????Norman Williams of the state Technology, Trade and Commerce Agency,=20
which was asked by Davis to help implement the order, said he was=20
disappointed to learn that police departments have been reluctant to devote=

?????"We need them to help us," Williams said.
?????Richard Giss, a retail analyst with Deloitte & Touche in Los Angeles,=

said many store managers may be unaware of the rules or are unable to easil=

?????Bob Israel, co-owner of Hungry Al's Bar-B-Que in West Covina, said the=

$1,000 fine didn't scare him into trimming his energy use. His monthly $500=

Businesses Hopeful on Blackout Warnings=20
Power: But some leaders worry that early outage notification won't be=20
accurate.=20

By MARLA DICKERSON, Times Staff Writer


?????Frustrated at being left in the dark about rolling blackouts, Californ=
ia=20
business leaders expressed optimism Friday that a proposed early warning=20
system will help minimize the economic damage of power outages on the state=
's=20
industries.
?????Gov. Gray Davis ordered state officials Thursday to begin warning=20
residents and businesses of likely power outages up to two days in advance=
=20
when power supplies appear scarce. Given the fluid nature of the state's=20
electricity grid, which can see its supplies swing from abundant to=20
inadequate in a matter of minutes, some of those predictions could prove=20
about as useful as a weather report six months in advance.
?????But business advocates say any information is better than no informati=
on=20
when it comes to avoiding outages.
?????"Businesspeople are accustomed to assessing risk," said Jack Stewart,=
=20
president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Assn. "We need to=
=20
give them the best available information, as far ahead as possible, and let=
=20
them make their own decisions."
?????Under Davis' order, blackouts will be issued under a three-tiered syst=
em=20
beginning with a forecast 48 hours in advance of a projected electricity=20
shortfall.
?????General geographic areas to be blacked out will be identified in=20
warnings issued 24 hours before likely outages. Precise locations will be=
=20
announced an hour before the power is cut.
?????Details are still being worked out, but the idea is to use data such a=
s=20
weather patterns and scheduled power plant shutdowns to make the longer-ran=
ge=20
projections. Information about communities and specific block numbers to be=
=20
interrupted will be provided closer to the projected outages, as real-time=
=20
usage and supply information becomes available to the grid operator.
?????Plans call for notifying electricity customers through a variety of=20
means, including the news media, the California Independent System Operator=
=20
(Cal-ISO), utility Web sites and a proactive system being developed by=20
Cal-ISO to phone, page, fax or e-mail individual power users. Agency=20
officials say they plan to implement the governor's order by June 15.
?????Business interests have been beating the drum for early warning since=
=20
the first rolling blackouts walloped companies last summer. Though resident=
s=20
might find it inconvenient to have their dishwashers turned off, a sudden=
=20
outage can wreak havoc on a company if an assembly line freezes or a comput=
er=20
system crashes.
?????The stakes are enormous. A Silicon Valley business group estimated tha=
t=20
a single blackout last June resulted in losses of $100 million for that=20
region's companies because of forfeited sales, squandered productivity,=20
wasted wages and ruined products.
?????A study released this month by a California business consortium=20
estimated that a projected 30-plus days of summer blackouts could cost stat=
e=20
businesses $21.8 billion, reduce household income by $4.5 billion and resul=
t=20
in 135,000 lost jobs.
?????Julie Puentes, a spokeswoman for the Orange County Business Council,=
=20
said the governor's plan is consistent with what businesses have been=20
demanding. "If they can do this, companies will be able to use the backup=
=20
generation that they've paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for," she sai=
d.=20
"They will be able to prevent chaos for their workers, and they'll be able =
to=20
maintain their business operations, which benefits the California economy."
?????The president of Aluminum Precision Products in Santa Ana, which has=
=20
four manufacturing plants in Orange County, was equally enthusiastic.
?????"You have no idea what help [the warnings] would be," Philip S. Keeler=
=20
said. "In our particular case, because of the heavy equipment, this could b=
e=20
the difference between life and death, and I'm very serious. It will help=
=20
tremendously."
?????Others are skeptical.
?????James Swartwout, chief executive of Torrance-based Summa Industries,=
=20
said he's not counting on the system to protect his molded plastics=20
manufacturing company.
?????"How can they say with certainty that a blackout will occur?" Swartwou=
t=20
asked. "It's my understanding that they have no real way of knowing until t=
he=20
very last minute. Eventually, we'll get two or three warnings a week. I can=
't=20
promise we won't start to ignore them."
?????Indeed, while early warning sounds good in theory, implementing it is=
=20
another story. The utilities long resisted such a system because they often=
=20
get only a few minutes' notice from Cal-ISO, which in turn often isn't able=
=20
to project a shortfall with absolute certainty until it is almost upon them=
.
?????One of the big concerns with early warning is that it simply won't be=
=20
accurate. Cal-ISO board member Mike Florio, a consumer advocate, said he=20
worries about crying wolf.
?????"After the third or fourth or 10th time," Florio said, "people start t=
o=20
say, 'They're always calling these things, and nothing ever happens.' "
?????But board member Carl Guardino, who also is head of the Silicon Valley=
=20
Manufacturing Group, sees that as a strength rather than a weakness of the=
=20
program.
?????He said early warning will prompt businesses to redouble their=20
conservation efforts, which could help stave off many of the projected=20
blackouts.
?????"That's not crying wolf; that's popping the champagne," Guardino said.=
=20
"Preventing blackouts from happening in the first place is precisely what w=
e=20
want."

San Diego, to underscore his conservation order for a 10 percent cut in=20
energy usage in federal buildings and military facilities.=20
In Los Angeles, he will deliver a wide-ranging talk before the World Affair=

to=20

But the real drama of the trip will no doubt be the sit-down between Bush a=

DAVIS THREATENING SUIT
The governor has said he will consider suing the Federal Energy Regulatory=

Commission -- the agency charged with overseeing energy prices -- if it doe=

not impose temporary price caps.=20
And the state Legislature has already filed a suit, saying the commission h=

With California's energy woes worsening and a summer of rolling blackouts=
=20
predicted, the Bush-Davis session holds potentially deep political pitfalls=
=20
for both leaders, both of whom are suffering in state polls as a result of=
=20
their handling of the energy crisis.=20
Bush needs to demonstrate his concern for California, a state that gave a=
=20
12-point margin of victory to Al Gore in the presidential election.=20
But even as Bush adviser Karen Hughes told state reporters this week that t=
he=20
president had arrived to show he cares, Vice President Dick Cheney again=20
chastised state officials for delaying their response to the energy crisis=
=20
"because all of the action was potentially unpleasant."=20
And Cheney signaled that the administration would resist long-term price=20
caps, saying, "We think that's a mistake."=20
Such talk drew fire from Davis' senior political adviser, Garry South, who=
=20
charged that Cheney's words demonstrated insensitivity to California's=20
troubles and only underscored the perception of an "all-oil, all-the-time=
=20
ticket."=20
Davis, whose campaign for re-election next year will depend on his handling=
=20
of the crisis, has stepped up his criticism of Bush and profit-hungry energ=
y=20
firms, particularly those from Texas, in recent weeks.=20
And yesterday, signaling no letup, Davis' supporters made an unusual holida=
y=20
conference call to again press his case for federal action. They argued tha=
t=20
without immediate intervention from the Bush administration, the economy of=

California -- and potentially the entire nation -- was at risk.=20

half a percent of the gross domestic product off of the national economy."=
=20
Blinder and others argue that short-term relief -- for about 6 to 12 months=
=20
-- is necessary while new power plants are being built.=20
"Most times and most places, I agree price caps are not the long-run=20
solution, but they can be part of a short-term solution," Blinder said.=20
"There really is a case for temporary price caps to shield consumers and th=
e=20
California and national economy from the full force of the energy shock."=
=20

on the sale of wholesale electricity begin today in California. But the=20

Political analysts say Bush's resistence on the issue could cost him in=20
California -- and elsewhere.=20

=20
when consumers have been socked with hefty electric rate increases, and $70=
=20
million is being drained from our state budget each day as we buy wholesale=
=20
energy at outrageous prices.=20
If Bush were serious about helping Californians, he would immediately tell=
=20
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC, to do its job. FERC's legal=
=20
mandate is to ensure that wholesale electricity prices are "just and=20
reasonable." But current wholesale prices are not just and reasonable, and=
=20
they are completely divorced from costs.=20
FERC has been ideologically fixated on the free market while ignoring the=
=20
reality that companies controlling California's energy supply are=20
manipulating the market to make obscenely high profits at our expense.=20
During the past several months, the news media have unveiled how generators=
=20
are turning power plants on and off as often as several times an hour; taki=
ng=20
plants off line for "unscheduled maintenance," and simply refusing to sell=
=20
California power. Investigators have determined that these energy companies=
=20
have deliberately gouged consumers to the tune of billions of dollars.=20
State Senate figures show that profits of these energy companies rose more=
=20
500 percent between 1999 and 2000.=20
If President Bush wanted FERC to control wholesale prices through a system =
of=20
cost-plus pricing, it would happen overnight.=20
When it comes to long-term solutions, Bush's energy policy dangerously=20
promotes a continued reliance on polluting fossil fuels and a resurgence of=

If the Bush administration were to make sustainable energy sources a=20
priority, technologies such as wind, solar and some types of biomass could=

solve our long-term energy needs. While such a policy is anathema to oil,=

coal and utility industry leaders, it is central to any forward-looking=20
energy strategy.=20
The sensible responses to the energy crisis are clear: Control prices now a=

While this will not help this summer, Abraham said in a statement the line=

The poll of 1,015 Californians, taken from May 11 to May 20, shows that 42=

"This should be a time when Bush is enjoying his honeymoon period," said Ma=

Vice President Dick Cheney fares better, with 47 percent of Californians=20

the governor's overall approval ratings have fallen statewide. Today, 49=20

While state and local political leaders appear to bear the brunt of the=20
public's negative feelings regarding the recent energy crisis, Californians=
=20
continue to give strong approval ratings to their two U.S. senators and to=

members of Congress, the poll showed.=20
Californians hold favorable views of Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who was re-=20

doing, the latest poll showed.=20
"She has always had good job ratings" among voters, said DiCamillo, "and th=

is just an affirmation of that."=20
Sen. Barbara Boxer also continues to get high ratings, with 49 percent=20

An 11th-hour proposal to help ease Nevada's budget problems and provide mor=
e=20
electrical power to neighboring California was outlined Monday by a key sta=
te=20
lawmaker.=20
Assembly Ways and Means Chairman Morse Arberry, D-Las Vegas, said his plan,=
=20
to be introduced Tuesday, would allow power plants to be built along the=20
Nevada-California border, on land that would be owned by this state.=20
"It could produce millions of dollars for the state," said Arberry, adding=
=20
that he has asked researchers to determine the exact dollar benefit to Neva=
da=20
to help get the proposal passed in the final week of the 2001 session.=20
Under the proposal, the state would negotiate with the federal Bureau of La=
nd=20
Management to acquire BLM land on the border of the two states, especially =
in=20
the southern Nevada desert region.=20
The state then could accept bids from companies that wanted to build=20
power-generating plants, and take the bid that would be the best deal for t=
he=20
state, he said.=20
The benefit to the power plant builders would be a site as close to a prime=
=20
market -- energy-starved California -- but located in industry-friendly=20
Nevada, which already has moved to speed up paperwork involved in power pla=
nt=20
approvals.=20
Arberry said he wasn't approached by energy company lobbyists to introduce=
=20
the idea. Instead, he said, "I was just talking to an old guy at the=20
barbershop, and he suggested it. I don't know if he even realized what he w=
as=20
saying."=20
As part of a broad effort to ensure Nevada has enough energy, Gov. Kenny=20
Guinn already has worked with local government officials, especially in=20
southern Nevada, to speed up power plant permit processes.=20
Legislative efforts include SB362, which lets various local and state=20

Davis said last week he was prepared to ``go to court'' if Bush failed to=

``Removing the so-called Path 15 bottleneck is a big step in the right=20

California should try true deregulation=20
Moving toward a government monopoly is the wrong prescription

Capitalism won the Cold War because of better economics: Consumers make=20
better decisions than politicians, central planners or monopolists. That=20
lesson seems to have been learned better by those who lost the war than by=
=20
those who won it.
The failure to absorb the lesson is nowhere clearer than in the efforts to=
=20
deregulate utilities. Deregulation, we are being told, has failed. The ligh=
ts=20
are going out in California, and now politicians, governments, consumer=20
groups and the utilities themselves are rushing to hang out signs that read=
=20
"Capitalism doesn't work here."=20
Principles matter, so let's start with some: The objective of government is=
=20
to provide a framework for a better life for its people, and monopolies are=
 a=20
bad framework. They are inefficient, and when they include the government,=
=20
whether as owner or comprehensive regulator, they are both inefficient and=
=20
dogmatic because politics enters the equation. We pay for that inefficiency=
=20
through higher taxes or higher prices.
We must, of course, keep the lights on to maintain our standard of living.=
=20
Does that mean that we just have to put up with the inefficiencies of=20
government-supported monopolies as a necessary evil to assure that importan=
t=20
services are available? We do not. The problem has not been too little=20
regulation, but too much. California is an excellent example.=20
What has gone wrong? The finger pointing has been great sport, but the core=
=20
of the problem is just the law of supply and demand. California flat ran=20
short of power. Many have wanted to build new power plants in California, b=
ut=20
the regulatory hurdles have been insurmountable. In recent times, the=20
utilities themselves said that California didn't need more power plants and=
=20
fought to stop the construction of new plants by others. The marketplace=20
didn't fail; regulation failed.=20
And California's vaunted "deregulation" was in reality just a botched=20
substitution of one form of regulation for another. When you deregulate a=
=20
monopoly marketplace, you want all buyers and sellers to be subject to mark=
et=20
forces. What California called "deregulation" didn't come close. First, the=
=20
state and the utilities agreed on fixed retail prices for five years.
As a result, consumers used electricity without knowing what it really cost=
=20
to produce. Second, the state and the utilities agreed that the utilities=
=20
would buy wholesale power through a system subject to market forces. As a=
=20
result, the cost of power bought by the utilities fluctuated even though th=
e=20
price they could charge was fixed.
The utilities thought the retail prices were fixed high enough to more than=
=20
cover what they expected power to cost them. For two years they were correc=
t=20
and bought power for much less than the fixed prices they charged their=20
customers, but last year the cost of power soared way above the fixed price=
s.=20
This wasn't deregulation, just another form of regulation. There were no=20
principles, just political expediency.=20
It didn't take long for economic reality to assert itself and the jury-rigg=
ed=20
structure came tumbling down. Blackouts, high prices and insolvent utilitie=
s=20
are not a failure of the marketplace; the marketplace never got a chance. N=
ow=20
we are at a fork in the road. Should we go back to the regulation of the pa=
st=20
or forward to full deregulation?=20
It's not fair to say that deregulation has failed. After all, we haven't=20
tried it yet. We should return to first principles: Deregulate properly by=
=20
making all aspects of the system subject to market forces. True deregulatio=
n=20
would include:=20
* Reducing the regulatory burdens on building new power plants.
* Eliminating fixed prices.=20
* Making sure that there are enough players in the market to make it=20
competitive.=20
* Having shareholders, not customers, be responsible for the financial=20
effects of business decisions.=20
Prices will vary with supply and demand and may rise at the outset until=20
supply is added, but over time a deregulated market will give customers the=
=20
lowest prices. The talk of a retreat to the regulation of the past is in pa=
rt=20
a result of our failure to articulate why capitalism won the Cold War and=
=20
competition makes the world a better place.=20
The tendencies of politicians to intervene, and of businessmen to ask=20
government to exempt their particular business from the marketplace, or som=
e=20
of its effects, remain strong. Ironically, prosperous times reinforce those=

tendencies by masking their effects on the rest of us. Whether in good time=
s=20
or in bad, the public interest is a David to the Goliath of politicians,=20
bureaucrats and businessmen who see governmental protection as safer for=20

Power generators and traders are finally realizing that the phrase "build i=

Back to the future with a twist

For some players, it's back to the future, a return to the days when the sa=
me=20
company owned the fuel, the generation, and the transmission=01*but with a =
21st=20
century twist. Today, the various factions are unregulated.=20

"What goes around comes around in this business," said Edward Tirello Jr.,=
=20
managing director and senior power strategist-investment banking at Deutsch=
e=20
Banc Alex. Brown. "The utilities used to own the various fuel sources, coal=
,=20
natural gas, and now they are getting back into it."=20

"Oil and natural gas firms are rebundling, reintegrating, but in an=20
unregulated sense," said John Olson, an energy analyst in Houston with=20
Sanders Morris Harris.=20

Can't burn paper in a turbine
With volatility as much a part of deregulation as mergers and acquisitions,=
=20
no power producer wants to be caught with its assets unproductive, i.e. wit=
h=20
a shiny, new combined-cycle plant and no gas to fuel it.=20

"You can't put paper in a pipeline; you can't burn paper in a turbine," sai=
d=20
Donato Eassey, head of natural gas analysis for Merrill Lynch in Houston,=
=20
Texas.=20

"There are developing some real physical concerns for getting natural gas,=
=20
and we will see some reneging on deals=01*even with contracts."=20

Olson has done the mathematics concerning the spike in demand related to ne=
w=20
plants=01*and the numbers don't work.=20

"To feed all the plants expected to come on-line in the next few years woul=
d=20
take an additional 13 billion cubic feet per day (Bcfd), and we are produci=
ng=20
52 Bcfd," according to Olson. "Gas production has only been growing at a ra=
te=20
of 0.4 Bcfd over the last 10 years=01*and well productivity has been down t=
he=20
last two years. We've simply been replacing our natural declines."=20

Control what's there
To put it in the vernacular: If enough gas isn't going to be there, you=20
better control what you can. Thus, Calpine Corp. in February announced a de=
al=20
to acquire for $1.2 billion in stock and assumed debt the Calgary, Alberta,=
=20
Canada-based exploration and production (E&P) firm Encal Energy Ltd.=20


No power producer wants to be caught with a shiny, new combined-cycle plant=
=20
and no gas to fuel it.=20

The deal gave Calpine a solid foothold in satisfying part of its seemingly=
=20
insatiable need for natural gas fuel, as it marches toward 70,000 MW of=20
capacity within the next three years. With Encal, San Jose, Calif.-based=20
Calpine's proven and probable reserves jumped to 1.7 trillion cubic feet=20
(Tcf), with a daily production capacity of 390 million cubic feet equivalen=
t=20
(MMcfe).=20

Earlier this month, Williams Cos. pushed oil behemoth Royal Dutch/Shell Gro=
up=20
out of the way and snared independent E&P player Barrett Resources Corp. fo=
r=20
$1.5 billion in cash, stock and assumed debt.=20

Williams' offer was music to Barrett shareholders' ears: At $73 per share,=
=20
the price was some 60% above Barrett's stock price the day before Shell's=
=20
unsolicited bid became a hostile offer in March.=20

Two weeks ago, another independent E&P player took the money and ran. San=
=20
Francisco-based HS Resources agreed to $66 a share=01*a 24% premium=01*$1.7=
 billion=20
in cash, stock and assumed debt from Kerr-McGee Corp. Not bad for a stock=
=20
trading around $20 a year ago=01*and around $5 a share in early 1999.=20

As was the case with Calpine's swallowing of Encal, Williams and Kerr-McGee=
=20
were thinking one thing when they bid the roof off: natural gas reserves.=
=20
Williams' proven reserves, including Barrett, more than doubled to 3.3=20
trillion cubic feet equivalent (Tcfe), while average daily production jumpe=
d=20
to 555 MMcfe.=20

Kerr-McGee gains via the HS Resources deal 1.3 Tcfe, about a 77% increase,=
=20
while daily production will climb 45%.

"Williams looked at Barrett using wellhead-to-power plant economics,"=20
according to Stuart Wagner, a principal in the Denver office of investment=
=20
banking firm Petrie Parkman. "It was looking at long-lived, low-risk=20
reserves."=20

More deals a no-brainer
Generators today cannot take the chance natural gas will not be available=
=20
when that 500-MW or 1,000-MW plant is set to be primed.=20

"If you are building the plants and you don't have the gas, you are down th=
e=20
tubes," Merrill Lynch's Eassey said. "If you are down a day in this market,=
=20
you're sunk. And buying gas in the ground is cheaper than buying it on the=
=20
market."

"The firms already have a market for their power, now they are locking in=
=20
margins," said Phillip Pace, an energy analyst in Houston with Credit Suiss=
e=20
First Boston. "It depends on how short you want to be. One hundred percent=
=20
short=01*you don't want to be."=20

Thus, there will be more plays made for sister firms to Barrett and HS=20
Resources, industry watchers believe. The acquisition of independent E&P=20
players is heating up.=20

"Will we see more deals? That's a no-brainer," said Merrill's Eassey. "You=
=20
think Equitable (Pittsburgh, Pa.-based Equitable Resources Inc., the larges=
t=20
holder of gas in the Appalachian region) is trading around $80 a share on i=
