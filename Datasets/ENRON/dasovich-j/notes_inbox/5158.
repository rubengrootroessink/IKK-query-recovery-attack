Hi Evening MBA students,

REMINDER:

If you plan to graduate in May 2001, this is to remind you to please come
into the Evening MBA office and fill out an Application for Candidacy
form.  You may have done so already.  We need your original signature on
the form and this Friday, March 2 is the deadline.

Thanks,
TJ
