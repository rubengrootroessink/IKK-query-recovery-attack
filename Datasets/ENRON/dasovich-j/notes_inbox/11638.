OK, here's the deal.  Gary Fergus has transcripts through July 11 and a video 
tape for July 16.  I'm having his office fed-ex all transcripts and the tape 
to me for delivery tomorrow.  I just realized you should also probably have a 
copy.  I don't have your office address, so call Jane at 415-442-1284 and 
have her make copies of the transcripts for you, too.  I'll have the 
videotape dubbed and will send you a copy of that.

It's going to be a fun weekend.

Wheeee....
