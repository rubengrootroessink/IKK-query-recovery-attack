Jim, I am afraid I don't understand.  We do have UC/CSU on utility service 
for all pg&E campuses and some SCE campuses. Therefore, I think they are 
purchasing power from an electrical corp on or after 1/17/2001, so I dont 
think this helps us.   
In any event, we are in a dispute with UC/CSU.  They very much want to retain 
their right to direct access - any legislative fix that would provide them 
with the ability to return to direct access after AB1x would end our 
dispute.  Is there anyway we can build in this flexibility?
One suggestion would be to say that any customer that was returned to utility 
service because the utility was not paying negative CTC has the right to  
return to direct access service at any time.  this is probably too technical, 
though.  Any other ideas?

Sue, etal -

It's important to monitor and support the section -

(b)  The right of a retail end use customer who has not purchased power from 
an electrical corporation on or after January 17, 2001 to purchase power from 
an alternate provider may not be limited by this section.

I think that this would take care of the UC/CSU issues (does anyone disagree)?

Jim

This is an OK bill.  Not well drafted. It's also overly complicated and 
proscriptive.

Deletes the offensive part of ABX 1.
It allows anybody to do whatever they want until June 1 (section 2 d)
On June 1, 
  - res and small commercial customers can get in a cue and get DA up to the 
# of MWs that are added through load growth. (Section 2 e)
  -- Larger customers would pay an exit fee. (section 2 f)
  -- DA customers would be a entrance fee to return to IOU service (Section 2 
g)

There is also a confusing section (2 c) that says a retail customer is only 
stuck with CDWR for the proportion of power that CDWR provides.  The way it 
reads, if CDWR is providing 40% of the IOUs' power, the retail customer can 
get DA for 60% of its load.  I doubt that will fly -- too difficult to keep 
track of and ISO will oppose (only one scheduling coordinator/meter)

A conference call and meeting is scheduled with parties tomorrow on this 
language.

Will keep you apprised.
