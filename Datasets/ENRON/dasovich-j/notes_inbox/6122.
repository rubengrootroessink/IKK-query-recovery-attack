DOE and FERC just briefed the Hill and confirmed they never issued the Order 
yesterday since Bonneville released a lot more power late yesterday.  The 
Administration advised that if the situation warrants, they will indeed issue 
the Order.  This remains a fluid situation with Richardson yesterday 
announcing his intent to "sign an Order" which his staff had not yet written 
while in the interim BPA acted so as to make his announcement moot.

We will continue to apprise you of the developments including reports of 
FERC's surprise site inspections.
