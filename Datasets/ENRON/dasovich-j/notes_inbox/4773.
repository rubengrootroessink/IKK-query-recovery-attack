This should give LEGC something to shoot at - 

I love the statment "In fact, a good case can be made that, given market 
conditions, consumers would have saved as much or more under effective 
regulation, without exposing them to price spike risk".  Isn't this the crux 
of the argument.

Jim

Subject: Consumer Group Reports Issued


On March 19th, the Foundation for Taxpayer & Consumer Rights published a 
report in it's Bailout Watch newsletter (Special Report: The Manufactured 
Energy Crisis) concluding that California's energy crisis has been 
manufactured by "energy firms."  A copy of the report is attached and is also 
available on the organization's website at www.consumerwatchdog.org.

Today, the Consumer Federation of America released a report (Behind the 
Headlines of Electricity Restructuring: A Story of Green, Irresponsibility 
and Mismanagement of a Vital Service in a Vulnerable Market) asking 
policymakers to "rethink" the move toward retail electric competition.  A 
copy of the report is available at their website at www.consumerfed.org or 
www.consumerfed.org/calmkt.pdf.  Copies of the press release and the report 
are also attached.
