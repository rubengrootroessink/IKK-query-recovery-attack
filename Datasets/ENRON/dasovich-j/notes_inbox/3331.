Market Participants and Scheduling Coordinators:

The CA ISO has received a number of calls from Market Participants asking to
review the confidential attachments to the CA ISO/EOB's March 1 motion
requested recently from FERC pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act
(request attached).  Market Participants argue that they require access to
the attachments in order to respond to the FOIA request.  The March 1 motion
requested confidential treatment for the attachments "although the ISO and
the EOB do not believe that confidential treatment is required under the ISO
Tariff" because they were nonetheless "concerned that release of the
information contained in the appendices at this time could adversely affect
the ngotiations currently underway between the State of California and the
generators".  Since these concerns exist, the CA ISO cannot release the
confidential appendices.  Attached however are the cover sheets to each
table which describe in detail what is contained in each table.  This
information should assist Market Participants interested in the matter to
prepare any response they may wish to submit to FERC.  Again, Market
Participants should not rely on the CA ISO to make their arguments for them.
