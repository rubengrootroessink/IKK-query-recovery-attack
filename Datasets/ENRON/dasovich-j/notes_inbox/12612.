FINANCIAL TIMES RANKS HAAS EXECUTIVE EDUCATION CUSTOM PROGRAMS BEST IN THE 
WEST 
 The Haas School's Center for Executive Development (CED) offers the tenth 
best custom enrollment programs in the US, according to the executive 
education rankings published in the Financial Times on June 4, 2001. Haas was 
the top school west of the Mississippi in terms of executive custom programs. 

The top ten US custom programs included Duke, Northwestern, Harvard Business 
School, Wharton, University of Michigan, Darden, UNC Kenan Flagler, Babson 
College, Cranfield School of Management, and, of course, Haas. Columbia 
Business School ranked first.

The same ranking named CED's custom programs 17th in the world and the second 
best in the world with regard to whether its programs fulfill participants' 
and corporate purchasers' aims. With regard to follow-up with the customers 
after completion of the program, Haas ranked fourth.

"We are very encouraged with this showing," said Paul Stames, assistant dean 
for Executive Learning at Haas. "For the past two years we have concentrated 
our efforts toward increasing custom programs for client companies and this 
strategy is paying off. We're very pleased that our clients are so satisfied 
with our programs. We went from not making the ranking pool last year to 
placing #10 in the US."

The Financial Times ranked schools that do more than $2 million of business 
in two categories: custom programs and open enrollment programs. CED ranked 
only in the custom programs category. 

The custom programs ranking was based on responses from two questionnaires: 
one completed by purchasers of custom programs (which accounts for 80% of the 
total score) and one completed by business schools.

WARREN HELLMAN TO SPEAK ON THE NASDAQ AT THE BUSINESS FORECAST LUNCHEON
 Financier F. Warren Hellman, BA 55, will share his formidable investment 
knowledge with alumni and friends at the Haas School's 2001 Business Forecast 
Luncheon on June 14 in San Francisco.? Having just paid $240 million for a 
10% share in the Nasdaq Stock Market, Hellman will speak on the timely topic 
of,? "NASDAQ's Strategic Restructuring into a Private, For-Profit Securities 
Market."

Hellman co-founded San Francisco-based Hellman & Friedman LLC 15 years ago 
and serves as the firm's chairman. Hellman & Friedman has raised and managed 
over $4.8 billion in capital and invested in 42 companies. Business Week 
called Hellman the Jimmy Buffet of the West Coast in an article on his 
investing prowess. He is known for orchestrating the massive deal that took 
Levi Strauss private in 1985. Hellman currently has large investments in Levi 
Strauss & Co., D.N.& E. Walter & Co., and Il Fornaio (America) Corp.

Prior to founding this firm, Hellman was a founder and/or partner at Hellman, 
Ferri Investment Associates; Matrix Management Company; Matrix II Management 
Company; and Lehman Brothers.? At Lehman Brothers, he served as president and 
head of the Investment Banking Division, as well as chairman of Lehman 
Corporation (a closed-end investment company). At age 26, Hellman became 
Lehman's youngest partner ever. 

Known for his physical intensity, Hellman runs 100-mile ultramarathons and 
does endurance horseback riding. He is also very involved in the San 
Francisco Free Clinic, serves as chairman of the San Francisco Foundation, 
and is a member of the Haas School's Advisory Board. He proudly wears his 
commitment to life and work on his sleeve: he has tattoos of his horse and 
his company logo adorning his arm and leg.
