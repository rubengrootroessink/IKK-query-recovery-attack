No one knows.  I'm just trying to find out what the prices are.

Delainey/Whaley buy off on the approach?

With the on-going discussions in CA, we need to make sure that we understand 
what would happen if a core / non-core split were implemented.

Basically, what is the 1 year, 3 year, and 5 year price for a E-19 and E-20 
customer with a typical load profile?  Has to be all in (as if EES were 
selling gen only service).

Give me a call if this does not make sense.

Thanks,

Jim
