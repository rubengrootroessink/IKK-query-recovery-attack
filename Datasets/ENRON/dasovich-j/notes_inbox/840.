FYI--good article sent by Mills below.

I think EEI and others are waking up to something big.  Also attach my latest 
graph that shows that new generation growth is 2x forecast since 1993.

Rob:
You going to be on that conference call I hope?  I'll be very interested in
hearing what they have to say.
Our new report, from our newly formed Digital Power Group (merging of
Peter's and my consulting in this 'space') titled

The Internet & Electricity: Deconstructing Demand

Is being announced formally at the EEI Annual CFO meeting the end of this
month (where I'm keynoting) - and we'll be making it available for purchase
at that time.  I'll send you a copy of the 'promo' piece once it's off the
press.

I will be most interested to see if CERA, a) believes the Internet consumes
electricity (I gather from hearsay they did not a while back), and b) what
numbers they put forth, and on what basis.

Keep me posted.

Thanks.

Also, did you see the San Jose Mercury news story on this subject:
