Jeff and Ricardo - will you guys be able to get this info for me (and the LNG 
group) by tomorrow?   If there are parts of the request that you won't be 
able to get by tomorrow, let me know and we'll ask outside counsel.   

Thanks so much for your help.
Lisa

Can we get paper - i.e. certificates, approvals, etc. for the pipeline in 
California, in Mexico, and at the border (Presidential permit).  I can also 
task outside FERC counsel if it is going to be too time consuming for you.


Regards.
Les

Sempra owns an LDC (that impoers gas from California) in Mexicali together 
with a group called Proxima (Mexican private company) at least a couple of 
years ago they began the project and then the construction of a natural gas 
pipeline from California to ROSARITO.  Rosarito is where several fuel fired 
thermoelectric plants have been sited since the early 1960's.  Now some gas 
fired thermo's are being built and there is no nat gas in Baja other than the 
one imported from the U.S. Sempra is building that line to supply the new 
plants in Rosarito.  Jeff Dasovich was trying to get that pipelint to be open 
access last year.  I am not sure where that is.

The building, permitting an dealing with the different interests in the 
region ha been difficult.

If you need som more specific info.  Please let me know.

Best,

Ricardo

Ricardo - do you know anything about Sempra's pipeline from Rosa Rita to San 
Diego Gas & ELectric?   We're trying to get information on the Mexican piece 
of the pipeline.  

Thanks.
