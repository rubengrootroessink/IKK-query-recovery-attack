Kinder Morgan and Calpine Announce Plans to Develop New Natural Gas Pipeline 
To California

Sonoran Accepts Binding Bid for 400,000 Dekatherms/day

HOUSTON, May 2 /PRNewswire/ -- Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. (NYSE: KMP 
- news) and national independent power company Calpine Corporation (NYSE: CPN 
- news) today announced plans to jointly develop the Sonoran Pipeline, 
subject to a successful open season and all other approvals. As proposed, the 
Sonoran Pipeline will be a 1,160-mile, high-pressure interstate natural gas 
pipeline from the San Juan Basin in northern New Mexico to markets in 
California. The project will provide much needed natural gas transportation 
capacity to California to serve rapidly growing electric generation demand. 
In addition, producers will be able to move more natural gas from the San 
Juan Basin through the Sonoran Pipeline. This will benefit California 
consumers, as access to these abundant natural gas supplies has been 
constrained due to a lack of pipeline infrastructure.

The interstate pipeline will be evaluated and developed in two phases, which 
will be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission (FERC). The first phase will run from the San Juan Basin to the 
California border, with the second phase extending from the California border 
to the San Francisco Bay area. The first phase of the pipeline is expected to 
be completed in the summer of 2003.

``This exciting project will enable us to grow our core business and extend 
our natural gas transportation service into new markets,'' said Richard D. 
Kinder, chairman and CEO of KMP. ``We don't currently transport natural gas 
into California, but we do own and operate the largest independent products 
pipeline on the West Coast, headquartered in Orange, Calif. We will utilize 
our expertise as a major natural gas pipeline operator and transporter to 
build the Sonoran Pipeline, and we look forward to expanding our relationship 
with Calpine, one of the leading power plant developers in America.''

According to Pete Cartwright, chairman, president and CEO of Calpine, the 
project will serve several important purposes for Calpine. ``The Sonoran 
Pipeline will help ensure a diverse supply of natural gas in California. With 
our existing plants in California, and our plans to bring on line an 
additional 9,000 megawatts of capacity, it is essential that we have a 
dependable, competitively priced source of natural gas. This important new 
pipeline will allow us to better control our costs in the California market 
to help lower energy prices and build needed generation. This project is a 
great example of two energy companies joining forces and utilizing their 
complementary strengths to provide real solutions to California's energy 
crisis.''

The project is expected to be developed in two phases.

Phase One:

Phase One will consist of approximately 460 miles of 36-inch, high- pressure 
natural gas interstate pipeline originating from interconnects with 
TransColorado Gas Transmission Company, Transwestern Pipeline Company and 
various points at the Blanco Hub in San Juan County, N.M. near the Colorado- 
New Mexico state line; thus providing access to the major producing basins in 
the western U.S. The pipeline will continue westward with delivery points on 
the California/Arizona border near Needles with a 20-mile, 24-inch lateral to 
Topock. The pipeline will initially transport up to 750,000 dekatherms (Dth) 
of natural gas per day and can be economically expanded with compression to 
transport up to 1.0 million Dth per day. A binding ``open season'' will be 
held this month and potential shippers will be given the opportunity to 
commit to firm capacity on the new line. Given sufficient shipper support in 
the open season, Sonoran Pipeline, LLC (Sonoran) proposes an in-service date 
in the summer of 2003. The estimated cost of phase one of the project is 
approximately $624 million. The open season will seek at a minimum, 20-year 
term commitments at a fixed transport rate of $0.39 per Dth for firm 
transportation. Sonoran proposes to charge shippers actual fuel on Phase One 
via a fuel tracker. Fuel is estimated at 1.3 percent. Sonoran has already 
received an acceptable binding bid from Calpine Energy Services, L.P. for 
400,000 Dth per day.

Phase Two:

Phase Two will be an extension of Phase One and consist of approximately 590 
miles of 36-inch and 42-inch high-pressure interstate natural gas pipeline 
continuing from Needles on the California border to points within California, 
terminating near Antioch in Contra Costa County. Depending on shipper 
interest, Phase Two will transport from 1.0 to 1.5 million Dth of natural gas 
per day. A non-binding ``open season'' will be held on Phase Two simultaneous 
with the Phase One open season, and potential shippers will be given the 
opportunity to express their interest in obtaining firm capacity to 
California delivery points. Sonoran has already received a non-binding bid 
from Calpine Energy Services, L.P. for 500,000 Dth per day for Phase Two. The 
estimated cost of Phase Two is approximately $1.1 billion.

The pipeline could connect with several gas pipelines, utilities and 
suppliers, such as Kern River, Mojave, Elk Hills, Pacific Gas and Electric 
Company, Southern California Gas and numerous gas-fired power plants, 
including Calpine's, along its route. Additionally, Sonoran would consider 
other potential connections in accordance with shipper requests.

After finalizing precedent agreements, in which shippers make binding 
contractual commitments to capacity on the line, Sonoran Pipeline will file 
an application for approval of the project with the FERC. Sonoran expects to 
utilize existing right-of-way corridors as much as possible to minimize 
potential environmental impact. Shippers seeking additional information on 
the project should contact Vice President Scott Parker at (630) 691-3689 or 
Project Director Ron Happach at (630) 691-3622.
