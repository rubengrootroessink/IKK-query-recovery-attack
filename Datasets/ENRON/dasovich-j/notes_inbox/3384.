Jeff:  Many thanks for your assistance today.  Following our call with you 
and Dave Parquet, we talked to GE reps here in Washington.  Tomorrow we will 
call OPIC and give them our talking points.  Since they will probably have 
some more questions, I was hoping we could get your participation at some 
point in the call.  We do not have a time at this moment but will probably 
aim for afternoon east coast time.  Will keep you posted.  If there are any 
times tomorrow where you definitely won't be available, please let me know.  
Thanks again, Scott
