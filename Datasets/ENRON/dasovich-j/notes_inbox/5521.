Attention all Evening MBA Students who are utilizing the PARKING option of 
their Transportation Assistance for Spring '01:

More parking passes are now available to be picked up in the Evening MBA 
Program Office, S460 of the Student Services Building.

We will be distributing 1 (one) book of 10 (ten) passes to each student that 
signed up for parking.

When the additional passes are delivered from the Parking Office (they are 
experiencing delays from their supplier) we will distribute them to you. We 
apologize for the inconvenience this has created. Please feel free to call me 
if you have any concerns.

Thank you for your patience,

Meg St. John
