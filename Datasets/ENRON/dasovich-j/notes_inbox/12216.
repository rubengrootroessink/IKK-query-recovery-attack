Here's my proposal for how we cover siting issues for Dave P. and Sam W. in 
California.  Let me know your response to the discussion and clarify as 
necessary.  I want to send this to Dave and Sam ASAP.  

Legislative activity:

? Issues that affect generation owners and operators:  We will rely primarily 
on IEP and only take a position on legislation or administrative activity 
that uniquely affects us.  (Mirant, Southern, AES, etc. have a greater 
interest in these issues that we do, given our business plan).  [Model is 
legislative and adminstrative effort to change basis for taxing power 
plants.]  
? Issues that affect siting or project development:  We will rely primarily 
on IEP, but will proceed with legislative proposals that have a high value to 
Enron.  [Model is the effort that Mike Day has engaged in--i.e., drafting 
legislation to consolidate conflicting administrative action on siting, etc.]
? Primary point of contact within Government Affairs:  Susan Mara
? Primary point of contact in Sacramento:  Scott Govenar


Administrative activity--CEC, CARB, etc.:

? Primary point of contact on environmental issues:  Mary Schoen.
? Primary point of contact if high level contacts need to be made within the 
agencies:  Susan Mara.  Our lobbyists have the ability to make these high 
level contacts on our behalf--particularly the Governmental Advocates firm.  
[From time to time it may be necessary to contact the CEC to expedite permit 
writing, etc.]

Local agency/community affairs activities:

? Primary point of contact for issues that arise from local concerns that may 
require legislation:  Susan Mara.  [Model on this issue is the Williamson Act 
legislation.  The issue and solution was identified at the local level.  The 
solution required legislation, which was then promoted in Sacramento.  GA 
acted to coordinate the efforts.]
