Rosie--the energy breakout session in Los Angeles runs from  1:45 to 3:00 (I 
think you might be getting your 2:15 info from the May 3rd agenda which is in 
SanJose).  

If Ken would like to attend the reception that night at 6:00,I would love to 
have him do that.  I also have a call in to Exelon what John Rowe's schedule 
looks like later in the afternoon.

I will talk to Dasovich about who will be going to the Bryson meeting with 
Ken.

Hi Sue -

I did receive a fax - thought it was just a clean copy, though, so I'd better 
pay better attention to it.  I will try to do a schedule for everyone today 
of the meetings I've arranged.  He is meeting with John Bryson, CEO of Edison 
International 5/2 at 3:30.

Do I read the new schedule correctly that Ken will be through at 2:15 or does 
he stay for the Media Availability with the Republican Governors?  I think he 
needs to leave for the meeting with Bryson at 3:00 as their office is in 
Rosemead, CA.  Does Steve attend this meeting?

Also, does Ken attend the Reception at 6:00?

Rosie

Rosie---FYI---as we talked about yesterday, John Rowe, the co-CEO of Exelon 
(which is the merger of PECO and Commonwealth Edison) will also be attending 
the Republican Governors event in Los Angeles on May 2nd.  Mr. Rowe is also 
the current president of EEI--the national association that all of the 
investor owned utilities belong to.

I would like to schedule 30-45 minutes for Ken to meet with him--primarily to 
talk about FERC issues (open access).

I'll call you later today to see how Ken's schedule is shaping up.  Did you 
get the fax that I sent earlier in the week with the updated RGA 
schedule/agenda?
