COLUMBUS, Ohio--The Dayton Power and Light Co. on Thursday received final=
=20
approval of its deregulation plan, setting the stage for residents and=20
businesses to shop for electricity Jan. 1.

The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio endorsed DP&L's transition plan tha=
t=20
includes a 5 percent reduction in the generation portion of residential=20
electric bills and three-year cap on rates. The discount is expected to sav=
e=20
the average DP=02=14customer $2.50 per month over the next three years.=20

"With (Thursday's) PUCO approval, DP=02=14has a transition plan in place th=
at=20
increases our growth potential in a competitive market," said Allen M. Hill=
,=20
president and chief executive officer of DPL Inc., parent company of DP&L.=
=20
"At the same time, it provides customers with a smooth transition to a=20
deregulated supply market."

DP=02=14provides electric energy generation, transmission and distribution=
=20
services to approximately 500,000 customers in all or part of 24 counties i=
n=20
west central Ohio.

Utility deregulation is a trend across the nation as state regulators seek =
to=20
lower prices for electricity, telephone and natural gas by replacing=20
monopolies with competition. Under deregulation, electric service is divide=
d=20
three ways--generation, transmission and local distribution.

DP&L's three-year plan, versus five years for most Ohio utilities, places a=
=20
ceiling on the cost customers pay for electric generation for three years=
=20
while fixing transmission charges for six years.

Customers will have the choice of shopping for electric power from various=
=20
suppliers, including DP&L. Those who stay with DP=02=14will get the 5 perce=
nt=20
discount.

Names of potential competitors have not been identified.

Those who select a new power supplier will have the electricity delivered=
=20
over DP=02=14lines. The utility will be encouraged to offer incentives so t=
hat 20=20
percent of its customers will shop around.

After three years, DP=02=14will have no restrictions on what it may charge =
for=20
electric generation. The utility also will have the flexibility to purchase=
=20
or sell assets without PUCO approval.

However, competition from new suppliers is expected to keep electric rates=
=20
under control, according to Robert S. Tongren, Ohio Consumers' Counsel.

"The new generation (capacity) being proposed and built right now in the=20
state of Ohio is gigantic," Tongren said. "It is huge."

He said California experienced post-deregulation price spikes during a rece=
nt=20
heat wave because the state is across mountains and can't tap into the U.S.=
=20
power grid. In addition, he said price controls make it unattractive for=20
companies to build new generating plants.

Tongren said his office helped write the DP=02=14transition plan and endors=
es it.

PUCO Chairman Alan Schriber said the plan "provides an opportunity to=20
jump-start the market by providing the resources for retail customers to=20
begin to shop for competitive generation services."

Schriber, a Dayton native, said the plan came before the PUCO as a settleme=
nt=20
in which the overwhelming majority of intervenors either supported or did n=
ot=20
oppose the resolution of the very complex issues inherent in this case.

"Nevertheless, the commissioners carefully scrutinized every aspect of the=
=20
settlement and determined that its approval is in the public interest," he=
=20
said. "Considered in its totality, we believe that our order approving the=
=20
settlement will provide DP=02=14customers the protection they are entitled =
to=20
along with the opportunity to acclimate themselves to the idea of shopping=
=20
for electricity." Folder Name: Utilities, Electric: Deregulation Relevance=
