Gary.

Thank you for the opportunity to discuss the Congestion Management
difficulties faced by the market with your membership.  WPTF has sponsored a
market approach to Congestion Management since its inception.  Last summer
produced good ideas and several proposals to the CAISO.

But now there is a need for immediate action created by the closing of the
CalPX.  APX can fill that void if we take action now.  And, we can jointly
move the solution to a market based approach.

Attached is the agenda for the meetings we have planned for February 21 at
APX to discuss the implementation with market participants.  You mentioned
that you would forward the agenda to your readership.  I appreciate your
support <<Draft Agenda 02_10_2001.doc>>  and hope you can join us as well.
