Thanks, I think we turned a corner yesterday, but I also half expect the desk 
to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.

Oregon had a late surge for Gore yesterday and he is up 7500 votes.  It will 
tighten, but I think Gore may pull it out after all.  Damn that Ralph....

Just talked to Sue re: yesterday's meeting and before I shoot myself in the 
head, I just wanted to say it's been great working with  you guys.  
Unbelievable....   In any case, congratulations.  Sounds like, all in all, it 
was a good meeting.


Scott:  has Oregon figured out who they voted for yet?
