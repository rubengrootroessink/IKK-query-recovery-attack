Kim, I had asked Randy to have you put Jeff Dasovich on the distribution list 
for these reports, but it must have slipped his mind.   Jeff's e-mail address 
is jeff.dasovich@enron.com.  Would appreciate it if you would send him future 
reports.  Hopefully, there won't be many more!!

Thanks.

All:

Attached is a brief memo describing the hearing.  One notable event that came 
out of today's hearing is that Bill Wise will take the stand tomorrow 
afternoon to answer questions from the Judge (and possibly other parties)  on 
the February 14 presentation regarding the EPME acquisition of the EPNG 
capacity.
