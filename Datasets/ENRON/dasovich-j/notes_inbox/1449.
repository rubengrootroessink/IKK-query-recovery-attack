All I know is they say it to our traders.  The rationale is to keep power in 
California.

Is this something they've said publicly?  If so, have they provided any 
rationale?  Thanks.

The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power is refusing to sell outside of 
California for less than $250.  This is diminishing liquidity in the market.  
However, we can't call FERC and complain because munis are not regulated by 
FERC.  Here is an example of something we should be bringing to NW 
congressional members re why FERC should regulate the munis.
