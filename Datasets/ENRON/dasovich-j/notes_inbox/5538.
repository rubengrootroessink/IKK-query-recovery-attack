I wanted to follow-up with everyone following yesterday's meeting. 

It appears to me that we need to develop (1) a better analysis of the four 
market models - AGL (Steve M), Columbia of Ohio (Janine), Socal Gas (Jeff), 
NICOR (Roy) - based on some key elements and (2) the key Influence parties in 
Illinois with 5 layer Influence Circles that we need to be thinking about in 
this discussion.

It would be great if we could get this to Laura for distribution by end of 
day Friday (realize it's tight).

Key elements for Market Models --

1. Direct Access Allowed?  For What customers?  What timeline?
2. Upstream Capacity resolution - assignment or otherwise?  Are there assets 
left to optimize
3. Retail pricing - Fixed price vs. PBR (how?) vs. something else?
4. Role of Wholesale Outsourcing Agent (would ENA sell to marketers or 
utilities or both?)
5. Other Issues

Thanks,

Jim
