I was just brainstorming on potential projects.  I thought that an interesting
and fairly relevant topic could be a current evaluation of Amazon.com and how
the projected revenues & profits relate to the current stock price.  We could
also provide some historical perspective on all realistic Amazon's stock price
was a year or two ago relative to a discounted cash flow.  I can fairly easily
get my hands on some Wall Street analyst research reports that could provide 
us
with some insights and hints as to what Wall Street is expecting.  Most of our
time can be spent creating a discounted cash flow model similar to what we 
have
been doing in class.  Since the jury is still out on Amazon's business model, 
I
think it would make for some interesting debate in class when we present our
model.
