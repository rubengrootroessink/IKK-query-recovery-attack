I think the Senate demos are at 26 to 14; they won Torlakson vs Rainey in
the East Bay, they barely held Machado in Sacramento/San Joaquin, they won
Dede, and they came within 3000 votes of winning Mountjoy's seat in the San
Gabriel Valley.  In the Assembly, they won two seats, which should put them
at 48-32.  In Congress, we took out Bilbray, Rogan, and Kuykendall, and won
Campbell's open seat, for a net gain of 4.  We came within 2000 votes of
beating Steve Horn in Long Beach.

I have no idea about Florida.  But in the Senate, there was a net gain of 4
seats, (Washington, Minnesota, Michigan, Missouri, Florida, Delaware), less
Republican take aways in Virginia and Nevada.
So I think that means 50-50. If somehow Lieberman is VP, his seat becomes
vacant, and the Republican Governor of Connecticut makes the appointment.

As Hunter Thompson once said, "when the going gets tough, the wierd turn
pro."  vjw
