To Congress.  From what I can tell, at least half of these economists are on 
Edison's payroll. Do we need to take any action? Where are the economists on 
the other side?

Attached is a letter signed by 10 prominent energy economists expressing "deep
concern about the failure" of the FERC to address the problems in the 
wholesale
power markets.  It is expected that new Senate Energy Committee Chairman, 
Jeff Bingaman,
will exercise considerable Congressional Oversight Authority to pressure
FERC to act to remedy wholesale prices.

Late Friday evening, the two new FERC Commissioners were confirmed by the
full Senate.
