Subject: Maps and Address for Sun Santa Clara


Karen,

Here are two electronic maps of the campus.  One of them is a close-up of the
campus itself.  The mansion is building 7.  The address is:

4070 George Sellon Circle
Santa Clara, CA

If you want me to walk you through it on the map, I'll be glad to.  The '7' 
is a
bit difficult to see on the map if you're not looking for it.  Unfortunately, 
I
don't have an electronic version of the close-up I faxed you -- it's off the
brochure and makes for a clearer picture.

Please let me know if there's anything else I can do for you.

Einat
