I don't know if you know the history behind McCullough.  He is a consultant 
who primarily advises industrial loads.  He advised his customers that prices 
were going down and that they should go on index based tariffs rather than 
fixed-price tariffs.  Needless to say, his advise cost his customers a great 
deal of money.  Notable examples are Bellingham Cold Storage and Georgia 
Pacific in Puget Sound Energy's service territory.  Rather than acknowledge 
that he was wrong, Robert is on a witch hunt.  His data is bad, his analysis 
is horrible, he lies with numbers but does a good job being pompous and 
putting together flashy power point presentations.  I have not heard of 
anybody agreeing with him, including the NWPPC, CEC, CAISO, CAPX.  He is a 
loud entertaining speaker, so I am sure that he will continue to get coverage.

Have there been any more reactions to the presentation that McCullough made 
at the "volatility conference" in Portland last week?
