Jeff/Michael,

In preparation of Ken Lay's tour through California next week, Steve Kean 
would like to meet with the two of you (in Houston) on Tuesday morning.  
Steve's morning is wide open, so please give me a time (one hour) that works 
with your schedules.  

Please cc Maureen McVicker .  Thanks!
