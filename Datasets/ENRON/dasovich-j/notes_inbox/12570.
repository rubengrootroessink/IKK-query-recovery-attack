Hi Jeff.  I just wanted to tell you why I was upset last night.  I feel lik=
e
recently, when I try to talk to you, you=01,re so quick to jump on me and s=
tart
criticizing or yelling at me.  It makes it much harder to talk to you about
things that are difficult for me to talk about in the first place.  It seem=
s
to me that people who care about each other would give each other the
benefit of the doubt and listen, and not just attack someone the first
chance they get.  Is it possible for you to be a little more patient and
supportive when I=01,m trying to tell you something?  It would make me thin=
k
you actually do care.

I hope you=01,re having a good time in Colorado.  Dennis Sidbury emailed me
back and said he has no idea what goes on on the Securities side of Pru.  I=
=01,
m talking to them at 9 tomorrow morning.  Call me if you get a chance.  I
miss you.
