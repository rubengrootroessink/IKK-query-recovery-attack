Is EES or ENA planning to attend the ISO's vendor fair and stakeholder 
meeting mentioned below?.  Gov Affairs was not planning on it unless one of 
you need us to go and we'll see if we can fit it in.  As you can see, one of 
our cusomters is asking about it.

Jeff,

I will not be attending the meeting. I suspect someone in our office will 
attend the meeting. I will ask Jeff Dasovich, Sue Mara, and Mona Petrochko 
whether or not they will attend and make sure they get in touch with you.

Bruno,

Hope all is well.  I again would appreciate your insight.  Do you know if we 
are participating in this meeting?  If so, who is attending?  Please point me 
in the right direction.

Thanks

Jeff

Jeff, will Enron be attending this meeting?  IBM would be interested in
receiving a report from this event.  We would also like to discuss
potential impacts/options for our CA sites.  Thanks.


The ISO will be hosting a Participating Load Stakeholder
meeting on September 20, 2000 at the ISO.  The meeting is a broad
stakeholder meeting to help refine our load participation programs for
2001.
Much of the day will be committed to presentations and discussions on
lessons learned from 2000 and proposals for 2001, including technical
standards, contractual issues, and load management.

          Some vendors have approached the ISO with systems that would
aggregate loads, give them an opportunity to curtail based on day ahead
energy prices, and provide the curtailment instructions and verifications.
This type of program may be ultimately sold to ESPs or IOUs. In order to
accelerate the testing of such systems the ISO may sponsor a pilot program
to test the system/approach with selected vendors.  The pilot program will
test the concepts, the interfaces, and assist in bringing together vendors,
ESPs, SCs, and the IOUs as we move forward toward improving demand
responsiveness in our markets.  We have reserved about 1 -2 hours in the
afternoon, to allow 3-4 vendors to present their approaches to the
stakeholder group.

          In addition, we welcome you to visit a vendor fair that the
ISO is hosting on September 21, 2000.  The ISO has      experienced
considerable interest from the market place in such a vendor fair that
would
include entities providing Data Processing Gateway technology for both
Generators and Loads in the Participating Ancillary Services Load Program.
This effort is being encouraged to develop multiple solutions pertaining to
installations of direct telemetry for Generators and Load providing
Ancillary Services to the ISO markets.

          The agendas are attached for both events, including
directions and lodging information.
          Please RSVP by September 13, 2000 to Sue Happ at
shapp@caiso.com.
          Thank you.
