Lysa will send you the complaint.  I'll send you the draft answer. =20

Typically I work with Dennis Benevides (EES) and our California regulatory=
=20
affairs people (especially Sue Mara) when we make FERC filings on behalf of=
=20
EES.  Is there someone else you'd like me to loop in?

Bracewell and Patterson prepares all of our FERC filings and usually EES=20
joins if Dennis says they want to.  We can do the same here if you like.  W=
e=20
have the same interest.

Mary--I'd like to have some more info on this matter.  Please send me the=

26th).

Are you working with anyone else at EES?  Who is preparing the answer on=20

is basically just along for the ride (like in the FERC Power Investigation)=

Thanks.  MDS

Subject: Proposed Answer of CMUA's Complaint

As you have already heard, California Municipal Utilities Association filed=
 a=20
complaint with FERC asking for cost based rates. The following is a brief=
=20
outline of an EPMI/EES answer to the complaint.  The answer is due Friday. =
=20
Please send me any comments ASAP.=20

currently faced by the California markets.  We should attach our white pape=

? 2000 prices greatly exceeded 1999 prices without regard to load.

market-based rates.  However, CMUA is wrong in the context of the West wher=
