At the same time, Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., used the occasion of his first=

Escondido eyed profit from Hanover plant=20



Sides were close, but deal crumbled
By Jonathan Heller=20
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER=20
June 7, 2001=20
ESCONDIDO -- You don't need much to build a small power plant: A jet engine=
=20
off a junked 747, a generator, some emission-control systems and a permit t=
o=20
build somewhere.=20
But how much money can you make on such an investment? Most people have no=
=20
idea exactly how much. But a rare glimpse into the big-money world of energ=
y=20
production can be found in Escondido, where a deal for a proposed 49-megawa=
tt=20
plant on city-owned land recently went sour.=20
Documents obtained by The San Diego Union-Tribune show that the deal, if it=
=20
had gone through, would have guaranteed the city up to $27 million over 10=
=20
years, and made a millionaire of the city's energy consultant.=20
The Houston-based Hanover Co. was willing to gamble about $35 million to=20
build a "peaker" plant on leased land in the city's public works yard. The=
=20
plant was designed to run part-time, feeding energy into the region's power=
=20
grid during times of peak demand.=20
Hanover and the city negotiated in secret for more than three months before=
=20
the deal fell apart. But the two sides appeared close to an agreement on=20
several key points:=20
?The city would have made $1 million a year in rent, plus a share of the=20
profits from the sale of wholesale electricity. In a figures adjusted for=
=20
inflation, the city was expecting to earn from $6.7 million to $27 million=
=20
over the initial 10-year lease.=20
?Hanover was expecting average rate of return of about 37 percent, accordin=
g=20
to conservative estimates, and recouping its $35 million within five years.=
=20
Any profits above that were to be split 60 percent for Hanover, 40 percent=
=20
for the city.=20
?Dean Tibbs of Concord, a consultant hired by the city, was paid $100 an ho=
ur=20
and stood to make 10 percent of any revenue the city received. Tibbs' incom=
e=20
was projected to be from $1 million to $3.9 million over 10 years.=20
Whether this deal is typical of other peaker plant proposals around the=20
county is not clear. Most of those are on private property, and not subject=
=20
to public disclosure. Some think the Escondido proposal was too optimistic.=
=20
"Those numbers are phenomenal," said Brian O'Neill, vice president of=20
Alliance Power, which is building several power plants in other parts of th=
e=20
state. "That's absolutely very rich."=20
"I would never enter in a deal like that," agreed Dale Mesple, an energy=20
consultant with Ramco, a San Diego company that is building a similar power=
=20
plant on private property on Escondido's West Mission Avenue. "The develope=
r=20
is taking all the risk."=20
The deal would have achieved Escondido's stated goal of a power plant with =
no=20
financial risk to the city. Its biggest cost would have been paying Tibbs.=
=20
When council members learned how much he stood to make, they asked him to=
=20
restructure his contract. But that never happened because the deal fell=20
through and he was fired. Tibbs, who did not return phone calls seeking=20
comment, was paid $26,500 for 265 hours of work.=20
Mesple said it was smart of Escondido to load Tibbs' contract with incentiv=
es=20
-- such as the 10 percent commission -- because the city had no expertise.=
=20
"This way, the city's interests and his interests were aligned," he said.=
=20
"This is a tremendous multibillion-dollar business and you don't just=20
arbitrarily step into that."=20
City Council members were reluctant to discuss the proposed plant, which wa=
s=20
debated mostly in closed sessions. But Councilwoman June Rady said she=20
opposed the deal because it wouldn't benefit ratepayers.=20
"It was a deal for the power-generating industry and a deal for the=20
consultant," she said. "I could not see where there was a good deal for the=
=20
people of Escondido."=20
Ratepayers might not have benefited, but Escondido would have cashed in on=
=20
the electricity crisis.=20
The one-acre parcel at the city's public works yard was appraised at about=
=20
$350,000, a small fraction of the minimum guaranteed return of $6.7 million=
=20
the city would have earned, according to a report done for the city by Keys=
er=20
Marston Associates. "On this basis alone, KMA finds that the proposed lease=
=20
will provide significant financial benefit to the city," the report said.=
=20
It was unclear exactly why Hanover rejected the deal. A Hanover=20
representative did not return calls seeking comment, but a letter from=20
Hanover executive Chet Erwin to the city said the proposal was "excessively=
=20
landlord-oriented."=20
Erwin also complained about "significant public opposition to the plant."=
=20
That comment was mysterious to city officials because details of the propos=
al=20
were never released to the public. There was, however, some public oppositi=
on=20
to other power plants proposed in the city.=20
Experts in the power-plant industry said they were not surprised that Hanov=
er=20
backed away. While it stood to make millions, its lease payments and revenu=
e=20
sharing might have made it hard to make a profit in the future if energy=20
prices nose-dived.=20
"A million dollars a year (in rent)? I don't think electricity prices are=
=20
going to be there for the next 10 years," said Alliance's O'Neill.=20
Bob Therkelsen, deputy director of the California Energy Commission, said h=
e=20
had heard of deals where cities have been able to charge almost whatever th=
ey=20
wanted to lease land to power plant developers. "This is an interesting tim=
e=20
and lots of interesting arrangements are coming out of this," Therkelsen=20
said. But the big question was whether Hanover had long-term contracts to=
=20
sell its electricity.=20
"Prices are high now but there's no certainty they're going to last more th=
an=20
a couple of years," Therkelsen said.=20






Increased hydropower behind price drop=20



By Craig D. Rose=20
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER=20
June 7, 2001=20
Experts say state electricity prices are falling because of a surprising=20
level of hydropower, cooler weather, increased supplies and pressure from=
=20
investigations into industry practices.=20
But despite the recent price declines, they note, electricity costs remain=
=20
nearly 50 percent above last year and volatile, with few believing Californ=
ia=20
has seen an end to its power crisis.=20
Peak prices slipped yesterday another $15, falling to a range of $62 to $79=
=20
per megawatt hour, according to Bloomberg News. This compares with market=
=20
prices that were routinely more than $300 per megawatt hour from late winte=
r=20
into the early weeks of spring.=20
Future prices have also declined with contracts for delivering power in Jul=
y=20
reportedly available for about $175 per megawatt.=20
Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an=20
industry group, said hydropower -- the cheapest electricity source -- has=
=20
been running at roughly average levels despite below average levels of=20
snowpack in the mountains.=20
Ackerman said the correlation between snowpack levels and water runoff is=
=20
imperfect. He added that there was no certainty that runoff levels would=20
continue at average levels through the summer.=20
A spokesman for Sempra Energy Trading, a sister company of San Diego Gas &=
=20
Electric Co., agreed that increased hydropower was helping to lower prices.=
=20
The spokesman also noted that some power plants in California that had been=
=20
out of commission have returned to service.=20
The state had a record number of plants out of service for months because o=

Senator Fires Warning Shot on Power Costs=20


By RICHARD SIMON, Times Staff Writer=20

?????WASHINGTON--The new Democratic chairman of the Senate energy committee=
=20
bluntly warned federal regulators Wednesday to act more aggressively to rei=
n=20
in electricity costs in coming weeks or prepare for Congress to intervene.
?????As Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.) turned up the political pressure on the=
=20
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, House GOP leaders scuttled an emergen=
cy=20
bill designed to help power-short California through a difficult summer. Th=
e=20
measure became bogged down in partisan wrangling over price controls.
?????Bingaman's comments were a sign of the sudden shift in energy politics=
=20
in Washington after Vermont Sen. James M. Jeffords' switch from Republican =
to=20
independent and the Democrats taking control of the Senate.
?????In his first day as chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources=20
Committee, Bingaman urged the Bush administration to "step up to its=20
responsibility" to ensure that wholesale power rates charged in California=
=20
are just and reasonable.
?????And new Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) expressed similar=
=20
sentiment in a letter to California Gov. Gray Davis.
?????"Unless FERC takes action," Daschle wrote, "I believe that Congress wi=
ll=20
have to consider legislation to address the issue."
?????Bingaman is co-sponsor of a bill introduced by Sens. Dianne Feinstein=
=20
(D-Calif.) and Gordon Smith (R-Ore.) that would direct FERC to limit prices=
=20
while ensuring that power suppliers recover their costs and still make a=20
reasonable profit. The Bush administration has opposed price controls,=20
contending they would discourage power plant construction.
?????The Feinstein bill appeared unlikely to come up for a vote in the Ener=
gy=20
Committee under the former chairman, Sen. Frank Murkowski (R-Alaska).=20
Feinstein said she hopes that if FERC doesn't act within a few weeks, the=
=20
committee will take up her bill. "We intend to keep the pressure up," she=
=20
said.
?????Even if such a measure were to pass the Senate, it would face stiff=20
opposition in the GOP-controlled House of Representatives and probably a=20
presidential veto. Nor is it clear to what extent Congress can dictate to=
=20
FERC, an independent body, what actions to take. But with their newfound=20
power, the Democrats believe they can, at minimum, increase political and=
=20
public pressure on the regulators.
?????On broader energy policy, the Democratic control of the Senate has=20
dashed GOP hopes for speedy approval of comprehensive energy legislation.=
=20
Democrats complain that President Bush's energy plan relies too heavily on=
=20
coal, oil and nuclear power. They are expected to push for greater emphasis=
=20
on conservation, energy efficiency and renewable energy such as wind and=20
solar power.
?????Bingaman said that in the short term he hopes to boost energy assistan=
ce=20
to low-income households, address gasoline price spikes--perhaps by revisin=
g=20
the patchwork of regional fuel recipes--and reduce electricity prices in th=
e=20
West.
?????In a breakfast meeting with energy reporters, Bingaman expressed hope=
=20
that two new FERC commissioners would act more aggressively in response to=
=20
electricity prices, which have bankrupted California's biggest private=20
utility, Pacific Gas & Electric, and cost the state billions of dollars.
?????But he noted that there are limits to what Congress can do. "Once a la=
w=20
is on the books, and a federal agency is not enforcing it, then usually the=
=20
remedy is in the courts," he said. Davis has threatened to sue FERC.
?????FERC officials said they did not want to get into a war of words with=
=20
Bingaman and would let the agency's record speak for itself. "This agency i=
s=20
continuing to work extremely hard on the issues facing the country in regar=
d=20
to energy," said Walter Ferguson, a top staffer for FERC Chairman Curtis L.=
=20
Hebert Jr.
?????The commission actions "are our testament," Ferguson added. "The=20
interests of consumers are paramount, and we will act accordingly."
?????In the House, GOP leaders declared dead a bill that would have provide=
d=20
some short-term help to California, such as federal aid to ease a notorious=
=20
bottleneck in the state's power grid and authority for the governor to ease=
=20
emission rules to boost power supplies during an emergency.
?????Democrats suggested that the legislation was killed to save California=
=20
Republicans from a politically difficult vote on price controls. Republican=
s=20
contended that Democratic leaders were unwilling to compromise.
?????Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas), the bill's author, said the impasse made it=
=20
unlikely that the legislation could pass Congress and clear the president's=
=20
desk in time to help California this summer.
?????Barton complained that his GOP colleagues felt like Charlie Brown abou=
t=20
to kick the football only to have the Democrats, like Lucy, pull it away at=
=20
the last minute.
?????But Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) asserted, "We were never clos=
e=20
to a deal."
?????"The Republicans say they cannot move forward on energy legislation=20
because Democrats refuse to support any energy legislation that does not=20
include wholesale price controls, and I say . . . right." added Rep. Bob=20
Filner (D-San Diego). "What good is a bill that does nothing for consumers?=
"
?????House Democrats vowed to continue to press for price controls. Some=20
Republican leaders who have resisted price controls appeared to be softenin=
g=20
their position, as long as it's called something else.
?????Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.), chairman of the House Energy and=20
Commerce Committee, said he was drafting a letter urging FERC to expand its=
=20
"price mitigation" order that limits the price that power generators can=20
charge.
?????The order now applies only when the state's power supplies slip low=20
enough to trigger an energy emergency. Rep. Doug Ose (R-Sacramento) has=20
introduced legislation to expand the order to cover all times of day and th=
e=20
entire Western region.
?????Democrats contend the Republican proposal doesn't go far enough. For=
=20
example, the top price paid for power would still be set by the least=20
efficient generator, providing bigger profits for newer, more efficient=20
generators.
?????Davis said in a letter to lawmakers that the FERC order is a "faulty=
=20
foundation on which to build relief for California. It is extremely limited=
=20
in its scope and applicability and provides little, if any, real price reli=
ef=20
for consumers and businesses in California."
?????FERC rules prevent staffers from commenting on specific matters=20
scheduled for commission action, such as any changes to the California pric=
e=20
control plan. "That issue is pending and we are prohibited from commenting =
on=20
it," said Ferguson.
?????Democrats contend that as Californians begin receiving higher utility=
=20
bills in the mail, the pressure will grow on Washington officials to clamp=
=20
down more vigorously on wholesale electricity prices.
?????But Rep. Mary Bono (R-Palm Springs), who has opposed price controls,=
=20
said that at a recent town hall meeting in her district, "out of probably 3=

questions, one came up on caps. People in California are looking for real=

solutions, and they recognize that's a quick political fix."

Emboldened by an unexpected plunge in electricity prices, state officials=
=20
said yesterday that they are prepared to press their advantage and walk awa=
y=20
from nearly two dozen long-term power contracts that now are at above-marke=
t=20
rates.=20
This represents a complete reversal from the state's position of just a few=
=20
weeks ago, when officials were at the mercy of power companies and were all=
=20
but begging for any available megawatts.=20
The state Department of Water Resources already has signed 38 contracts to=
=20
purchase electricity at fixed prices over the next decade. But 23 other=20
contracts, or about 40 percent of the total, remain in negotiations.=20
"We may not need all 23," said Ray Hart, deputy director of the state=20
Department of Water Resources. The department so far has spent about $8=20
billion for electricity on behalf of California's cash-strapped utilities.=
=20
If power companies are unwilling to meet the state's demands for more=20
favorable prices, he said, "I don't think all those contracts will come to=
=20
term."=20
Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, was quick to underline=20
California's changed fortunes as an electricity buyer.=20
"We're in the driver's seat now," he said. "There's no question about that.=
"=20
Other officials were feeling similarly encouraged by California's stronger=
=20
position to press their attack on power companies that they suspect of havi=
ng=20
pushed electricity prices higher.=20
Larry Drivon, special counsel to a state Senate committee investigating=20
alleged price manipulation, said the sudden drop in power costs will not=20
derail attempts to determine if power companies illegally gouged customers.=
=20
"Prices have gone down, but they're also capable of going back up again in =
a=20
hurry," he said.=20
Electricity prices have tumbled to the lowest levels since April 2000 -- as=
=20
low as $50 per megawatt hour yesterday, compared with more than $500 earlie=
r=20
this year.=20
Experts attributed the drop to a decline in the price of natural gas, which=
=20
is the fuel that runs most power plants. Milder weather has cut power deman=
d=20
by reducing use of air conditioners, which in turn slashes the amount of ga=
s=20
required by generators.=20
Experts also cited increased electricity production at plants and dams, as=
=20
well as greater conservation by consumers and businesses.=20
"The Armageddon we thought we were facing this summer has backed away a bit=
,=20
" said Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California Energy=
=20
Institute in Berkeley.=20
"These lower prices are saying that the market is not going to be as tight =
as=20
expected," he said. "That means fewer blackouts."=20
It also means California's long-term contracts increasingly appear to be a=
=20
raw deal if power prices continue to fall.=20
A state report to be released today says the average contract price is abou=
t=20
$70 per megawatt hour over 10 years and that the average price over the nex=
t=20
five years is $84 -- well above current market rates.=20
The average contract price in the third quarter of 2001 is $138, rising to=
=20
$142 in the fourth quarter, the report says.=20
LOOKING FOR BETTER DEALS
"I want to work for more favorable deals," said Hart at the Department of=
=20
Water Resources.=20
However, he said, details of the accords will not be made available for the=
=20
foreseeable future because that could jeopardize the state's bargaining=20
position in any subsequent talks with generators.=20
This contradicted a pledge from the governor last week that details of the=
=20
contracts would be revealed within 30 days.=20
The Chronicle and other media outlets are suing for access to the accords,=
=20
arguing that the public has a right to know how $40 billion in tax dollars =
is=20
being spent.=20
Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco, said he plans to=20
discuss with colleagues how the drop in power prices can be used to=20
accelerate the release of the contracts.=20
"We can't know if the contracts show whether the state is being smart or=20
stupid until we see them," he said.=20
PRICE DROP OUT OF BLUE
This much at least is clear: Almost no one could have forecast just weeks a=
go=20
that wholesale electricity prices would drop below $100 this summer.=20
A few months ago, June electricity prices on the forward power market were=
=20
running close to $400.=20
One reason for the changed outlook, ironically, is last week's heat wave,=
=20
which left Northern California sizzling and would have been expected to cau=
se=20
electricity prices to soar as millions of air conditioners kicked into gear=
.=20
Instead, power prices remained steady, "and that really changed the=20
psychology of the market," said Brian Jordan, who monitors electricity=20
trading at energy market researcher Platts.=20
Michael Wilczek, another Platts analyst, said that price stability was=20
bolstered by an increased number of generating plants returning to service=
=20
after spring repairs.=20
He also cited a surge in electricity output from regional dams as the high=
=20
temperatures caused mountain snow to melt.=20
NIGHTMARE HAS ABATED
"Now, things aren't looking like the nightmare scenario some people were=20
expecting," Wilczek said. "But it still could be a volatile summer."=20
Jeff Brown, a member of the state Public Utilities Commission, said the=20
situation could change "in a New York minute."=20
"It's only June," Brown said. "We've got to go through July, August and=20
September."=20
Paul Clanon, the head of PUC's energy division, agreed with Brown that=20
natural gas costs could spike again.=20
"I wouldn't hold out big hope for anyone that those decreases are going to =
be=20
permanent," Clanon said.=20
Indeed, if there is one thing Californians have learned, it is that trying =
to=20
guess where energy prices are headed is a sucker's game. In April, for=20
example, the August electricity price on forward markets was about $700.=20
Yesterday it was closer to $200.=20
This summer's weather will be the deciding factor in determining whether th=
e=20
actual August price on daily markets will be as low as $30 or back up at th=
e=20
$1,900 level seen earlier this year.=20

Amid astronomical power prices in California and other parts of the West,=

Department of Water Resources. The department so far has spent about $8=20
billion for electricity on behalf of California's cash-strapped utilities.=
=20
If power companies are unwilling to meet the state's demands for more=20
favorable prices, he said, "I don't think all those contracts will come to=
=20
term."=20
Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, was quick to underline=20
California's changed fortunes as an electricity buyer.=20
"We're in the driver's seat now," he said. "There's no question about that.=
"=20
Other officials were feeling similarly encouraged by California's stronger=
=20
position to press their attack on power companies that they suspect of havi=
ng=20
pushed electricity prices higher.=20
Larry Drivon, special counsel to a state Senate committee investigating=20
alleged price manipulation, said the sudden drop in power costs will not=20
derail attempts to determine if power companies illegally gouged customers.=
=20
"Prices have gone down, but they're also capable of going back up again in =
a=20
hurry," he said.=20
Electricity prices have tumbled to the lowest levels since April 2000 -- as=
=20
low as $50 per megawatt hour yesterday, compared with more than $500 earlie=
r=20
this year.=20
Experts attributed the drop to a decline in the price of natural gas, which=
=20
is the fuel that runs most power plants. Milder weather has cut power deman=
d=20
by reducing use of air conditioners, which in turn slashes the amount of ga=
s=20
required by generators.=20
Experts also cited increased electricity production at plants and dams, as=
=20
well as greater conservation by consumers and businesses.=20
"The Armageddon we thought we were facing this summer has backed away a bit=
,=20
" said Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California Energy=
=20
Institute in Berkeley.=20
"These lower prices are saying that the market is not going to be as tight =
as=20
expected," he said. "That means fewer blackouts."=20
It also means California's long-term contracts increasingly appear to be a=
=20
raw deal if power prices continue to fall.=20
A state report to be released today says the average contract price is abou=
t=20
$70 per megawatt hour over 10 years and that the average price over the nex=
t=20
five years is $84 -- well above current market rates.=20
The average contract price in the third quarter of 2001 is $138, rising to=
=20
$142 in the fourth quarter, the report says.=20
LOOKING FOR BETTER DEALS
"I want to work for more favorable deals," said Hart at the Department of=
=20
Water Resources.=20
However, he said, details of the accords will not be made available for the=
=20
foreseeable future because that could jeopardize the state's bargaining=20
position in any subsequent talks with generators.=20
This contradicted a pledge from the governor last week that details of the=
=20
contracts would be revealed within 30 days.=20
The Chronicle and other media outlets are suing for access to the accords,=
=20
arguing that the public has a right to know how $40 billion in tax dollars =
is=20
being spent.=20
Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco, said he plans to=20
discuss with colleagues how the drop in power prices can be used to=20
accelerate the release of the contracts.=20
"We can't know if the contracts show whether the state is being smart or=20
stupid until we see them," he said.=20
PRICE DROP OUT OF BLUE
This much at least is clear: Almost no one could have forecast just weeks a=
go=20
that wholesale electricity prices would drop below $100 this summer.=20
A few months ago, June electricity prices on the forward power market were=
=20
running close to $400.=20
One reason for the changed outlook, ironically, is last week's heat wave,=
=20
which left Northern California sizzling and would have been expected to cau=
se=20
electricity prices to soar as millions of air conditioners kicked into gear=
.=20
Instead, power prices remained steady, "and that really changed the=20
psychology of the market," said Brian Jordan, who monitors electricity=20
trading at energy market researcher Platts.=20
Michael Wilczek, another Platts analyst, said that price stability was=20
bolstered by an increased number of generating plants returning to service=
=20
after spring repairs.=20
He also cited a surge in electricity output from regional dams as the high=
=20
temperatures caused mountain snow to melt.=20
NIGHTMARE HAS ABATED
"Now, things aren't looking like the nightmare scenario some people were=20
expecting," Wilczek said. "But it still could be a volatile summer."=20
Jeff Brown, a member of the state Public Utilities Commission, said the=20
situation could change "in a New York minute."=20
"It's only June," Brown said. "We've got to go through July, August and=20
September."=20
Paul Clanon, the head of PUC's energy division, agreed with Brown that=20
natural gas costs could spike again.=20
"I wouldn't hold out big hope for anyone that those decreases are going to =
be=20
permanent," Clanon said.=20
Indeed, if there is one thing Californians have learned, it is that trying =
to=20
guess where energy prices are headed is a sucker's game. In April, for=20
example, the August electricity price on forward markets was about $700.=20
Yesterday it was closer to $200.=20
This summer's weather will be the deciding factor in determining whether th=
e=20
actual August price on daily markets will be as low as $30 or back up at th=

$1,900 level seen earlier this year.=20

e=20
will try to force them to do so.=20
But over in the House of Representatives, a partisan brawl over limits on t=

wholesale price of energy led Republicans to withdraw their bill, which is=
=20
intended to help California out of its electricity mess.=20
Even as Republicans insisted that price caps would never win approval in th=
e=20
House, they sent a letter to federal regulators urging a tough stand on=20
market manipulation and all but conceded that the issue was beginning to hu=
rt=20

The actions put the two chambers -- and the two parties -- on a collision=
=20
course over price controls that promises to play out in Washington through=

the summer, waxing or waning with California's expected blackouts.=20
The Bush administration strongly opposes controls, saying they would not=20

Democrats in Congress insist that price controls will solve the short-term=
=20
problem by stanching the flow of money out of the state.=20
The effort by the Democrats has been given a boost by their takeover of the=

Senate. Soft-spoken and Stanford-educated Democratic Sen. Jeff Bingaman of=

I=20

But if the energy regulators are unwilling, he said, he would consider Sena=

In the House, however, Republicans charged the Democrats with using the pri=

Rep. Billy Tauzin, the Louisiana Republican who heads the House Commerce=20

Tauzin also said that while Republicans had the votes to move the bill, it=

expected problems.=20
Tauzin effusively praised Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Los Angeles, for making a=20
"very sincere effort" to bridge the partisan differences over price control=

But Texas Republican Joe Barton charged that House Democratic leader Dick=

Gephardt had short-circuited the talks so the Democrats could keep price=20

"Mr. Gephardt apparently made a decision to kowtow to the more radical=20

"It appeared to me that Mr. Gephardt did not want a deal," Barton said.=20
No sooner did the Republicans leave their press conference than Democrats=
=20
charged into the same room to deny any such thing.=20
"We were never close to a deal," Waxman said. The Democrats said a proposal=

Energy Regulatory Commission -- which imposes a benchmark price during Stag=

"The FERC has said they weren't going to do anything to help California, th=
e=20

But Fresno Republican George Radanovich said the two parties had been in=20
serious discussions on a Democratic proposal to impose price caps until 80=

contracts.=20
But that fell apart, he said, when some worried whether 80 percent was the=

"For politics, they want to keep the price cap issue," Radanovich said of t=

Sacramento -- A $12.5 billion bonds-for-electricity deal considered critica=
l=20
to California's budget solvency may be delayed unless the state takes steps=
=20
quickly to assure underwriters that the bonds are a sound investment.=20
Backers want greater certainty that buyers of the bonds will be guaranteed=
=20
revenue from utility ratepayers before taking the sale to market, according=
=20
to state bankers and lawmakers.=20
Without those assurances, the bond sale could be delayed or, if it is not,=
=20
the selling costs could be higher for the state if buyers see the bond issu=
e=20
as a riskier investment. Providing that certainty, however, could mean a ra=
te=20
increase should the state's energy costs rise.=20
"The bond market simply is not going to respond to a sale where there is no=
t=20
an assured revenue stream," said Sen. Steve Peace, D-Chula Vista, chairman =
of=20
the upper house's budget committee. "And that revenue stream is not there=
=20
yet."=20
STATE BUDGET AT RISK
Without the bond sale, the state budget would be forced to absorb the more=
=20
than $8 billion it has spent since January to purchase power for=20
cash-strapped utilities. A financial blow of that size could only be absorb=
ed=20
by making deep cuts in spending, raising taxes or both.=20
The three state budget proposals created by the Democratic governor, the=20
Assembly and the Senate all assume the bonds will be sold and the state's=
=20
coffers replenished.=20
But a lot must be done to accomplish that.=20
Although underwriters and bond lawyers working with State Treasurer Phil=20

negotiations said several key elements necessary to market the bonds are no=
t=20

The first of these is that buyers of the bonds want to be sure they will ge=
t=20
paid.=20
The plan is for a portion of each utility customer's bill to be devoted to=
=20
paying off bond holders.=20
Essential to the bond deal is a formal agreement between the Public Utiliti=
es=20
Commission and the state that whatever costs the state incurs, buying power=
=20
will be covered by the rates charged utility customers.=20
That pledge, which could mean a rate increase if energy prices don't keep=
=20
falling, is intended to give bond buyers the confidence there will be enoug=
h=20
revenue to pay them off.=20
The Department of Water Resources, which buys the state's power, estimates=
=20
that it needs about $700 million a month to cover its costs -- a total of=
=20
$9.2 billion through June 2002.=20
The assumption is that as energy prices fall, state costs will drop, freein=
g=20

"Ratepayer revenues, including the most recent rate increase, are expected =
to=20

director of Gov. Gray Davis' Department of Finance, which is involved in th=
e=20
negotiations with the PUC.=20
PUC DUBIOUS ABOUT DEAL
Participants in the negotiations say the PUC is reluctant to sign the=20
agreement because it would surrender its power over deciding whether the=20
state spent more than it should in buying power.=20
PUC Commissioner Jeff Brown said that giving a blanket assurance the state'=
s=20
expenses will be covered might lead to an automatic rate increase if curren=
t=20
rates turn out to be too low to cover both utility costs and the state's=20
power purchases.=20
"The PUC has rate setting authority," Brown said. "We have to be in a=20
position to protect the ratepayers."=20
But Brown said the PUC has just begun the process of determining how the=20
money will be shared, an issue that is likely to be hotly contested over th=
e=20
next month.=20
UNRESOLVED ISSUES
There are still other issues that must be resolved before the bond sale.=20
The state must sign agreements with Pacific Gas and Electric Co., Southern=
=20
California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric on how the utilities will=20
route ratepayer money to the state to pay its costs.=20
And the PUC must increase rates for SDG&E customers because higher rates fo=

those ratepayers is part of the revenue flow to the state, Angelides said.=

Peace and others predict that the bonds will eventually be sold, probably a=

high yields for investors and higher costs for the state.=20
The sale probably won't happen in August as first hoped, however.=20
Angelides said the two weeks before Labor Day are poor ones to sell the bon=

Mercury News=20


After months of pessimistic predictions that California was facing a summer=
=20
of blackouts, the energy outlook is brightening.=20
Increased conservation, new power plants and more electricity imports are=
=20
easing the threat of routine summer outages.=20
``I feel good,'' said Bob Therkelsen, deputy director of the California=20
Energy Commission, crediting a crash program to speed power-plant=20
construction and persuade people to use less electricity. ``Overall, that=
=20
objective of increasing supply and reducing demand is happening.''=20
While no experts say the crisis is over -- and some warn the situation coul=
d=20
quickly worsen -- state energy analysts and some industry officials are=20
revising their dire forecasts.=20
Things certainly didn't look good two months ago. Back then, power plant=20
breakdowns and routine repairs had made nearly 15,000 megawatts of power=20
unavailable in California -- about a third of what the state normally uses.=
=20
And Gov. Gray Davis was warning that by May and early June, the state could=
=20
be ravaged by blackouts.=20
But a lot has changed since then. On Wednesday, only about 6,000 megawatts=
=20
was unavailable because of plant repairs. Other than two blackout days -- o=
n=20
May 7 and May 8 -- last month and the first part of June have had relativel=
y=20
few power problems. Moreover, appeals to conserve appear to be sinking in. =
On=20
Sunday, state officials announced an 11 percent drop in electrical use last=
=20
month compared with May last year.=20
Not wasting power is especially crucial, said Richard Grix, an analyst with=
=20
the California Energy Commission.=20
``It's really been the people who have turned up the thermostats, put in th=
e=20
fluorescent energy-efficient light bulbs and run their dryers at night,'' h=
e=20
said. ``It's all the efforts of people trying to conserve electricity that=

have made the outlook a lot better. And that still has to happen'' to avert=
=20
blackouts this summer.=20
James Macias, executive director of the San Jose-based power plant develope=

Calpine Corp., said he expected fewer blackouts and lower electricity price=
s=20
than predicted this summer because of the number of new plants coming onlin=
e.=20
``I'm optimistic things are improving,'' he said in a New York briefing.=20
News from Northwest=20
California's prospects for buying electricity from other states appear to b=
e=20
better, too.=20
The state normally relies on such imports for about one-fourth of the power=
=20
it uses, with much of it coming from the Pacific Northwest. In recent month=
s,=20
California officials had feared those supplies might dry up this summer,=20
because a drought had reduced the amount of water needed to drive the=20
region's hydroelectric dams. But those concerns have eased.=20
``We're not out of the woods yet,'' concluded a study last week by the=20
Northwest Power Planning Council. But since its last analysis of available=
=20
power supplies in March, it added, ``the situation has improved=20
considerably.''=20
Officials at the Bonneville Power Administration, the giant Portland, Ore.,=
=20
federal hydropower agency, sounded a similarly sunny note. They said=20
agreements by aluminum and other major industries to reduce their power usa=
ge=20
has made more power available for California.=20
Bonneville, with 29 dams and a nuclear plant, generates 8,000 megawatts and=
=20
is obligated to deliver 11,000 megawatts. Typically, it buys the difference=
=20
on the market. So with power prices soaring, Bonneville asked the industrie=
s=20
to reduce demand by 3,000 megawatts or face price increases up to 250=20
percent.=20
So far, the companies have committed to drop 1,200 megawatts, which means=
=20
there is that much more electricity available for other customers, includin=
g=20
California, said Bonneville spokesman Mike Hansen. ``We're not out there=20
competing with everyone else for that power,'' he said. ``We're feeling=20
pretty good about this summer.''=20
Help from the weather=20
Even the weather appears to be cooperating.=20
To be sure, May was hotter than normal and temperatures are expected to be=
=20
unusually hot across much of the Southwest. That could drive up electricity=
=20
use for air conditioning in places like Arizona, potentially limiting the=
=20
Southwest's ability to ship power here. But the long-term forecast for=20
California looks normal, which means ``no apocalyptic forecast here and=20
that's good,'' said Walter Snell, a meteorologist with the National Weather=
=20
Service in Monterey.=20
Such guarded optimism about the state's power supplies comes as electricity=
=20
prices have unexpectedly fallen to levels not seen since last spring before=
=20
California's energy crisis erupted.=20
Market experts say prices reflect lower power-plant fuel costs, more import=
s=20
and increased conservation, but caution that prices, like the blackout=20
threat, are likely to again rise this summer.=20
Words of caution=20
Arthur O'Donnell, editor of California Energy Markets, said a big reason th=
at=20
hydroelectric supplies have increased in the Pacific Northwest is that the=
=20
snow has melted a month earlier than usual. While that unexpected surge of=
=20
power has helped bring down electricity prices across the West, he said, it=
=20
could cause those same supplies to peter out earlier than expected this=20
summer.=20
Others warn that a sudden rash of power-plant breakdowns or an unexpected=
=20
spell of hot weather could easily push California back to the brink of=20
blackouts. In addition, they fear some generators might withhold power to=
=20
drive up prices, although suppliers have denied doing that.=20
Gov. Davis' spokesman Steve Maviglio said it's wise not to take any=20

Four-day week for city halls?
POWER CRISIS=20
Antioch and Vallejo are considering Fridays off to cut power costs=20

TIMES STAFF WRITER=20
Antioch and Vallejo are among several California cities looking to shed=20
energy use by cutting back on the number of days that city hall stays open.=
=20
Local agencies have started to feel the pinch of higher electricity bills,=
=20
and some are beginning to exhaust their efforts to squeeze out savings from=
=20
conservation.=20
Antioch officials soon will consider a move to close City Hall every other=
=20
Friday, but will keep the doors open longer on other days.=20
"Once you put something like that in place, I think we'd look at that as=20
being permanent," said Ron Ward, the city's community development director.=
=20
"It provides a little more flexibility for the commute public and it provid=
es=20
a benefit for employees."=20
The city has budgeted a 46 percent increase in electricity and natural gas=
=20
costs for the fiscal year beginning July 1. It is not yet clear how much th=
e=20
extra day of darkness would save.=20
In Vallejo, the City Council next week will consider starting a four-month=
=20
pilot program for a four-day work week at City Hall, with extended hours on=
=20
the other four days. The city figures it can save 28 percent off its energy=
=20
bill, and may also realize a $50,000 profit in a program to sell its saved=
=20
energy back to the statewide grid.=20
"It has the potential to become permanent and expand to other buildings. It=
=20
also has the potential to go away if it doesn't result in the savings we=20
expect," said Mary Hill, assistant city manager.=20
Beginning next week, Las Positas College in Livermore and Chabot College in=
=20
Hayward will shut down on Fridays through the end of July. Energy costs for=
=20
the Chabot-Las Positas district will run about $800,000 more than budgeted=
=20
for this year, said district spokeswoman Jennifer Aries.=20
Many cities and public agencies have switched to more efficient traffic=20
signal lights, ratcheted back air conditioners and installed motion sensors=
=20
to dim lights when nobody's around. Even with those measures, energy costs=
=20
are expected to rise dramatically over last year.=20
Making matters worse in the Bay Area, a power pool that secured cheap=20
electricity for 56 public agencies took a bath last month under the weight =
of=20
the state's energy debacle, forcing those agencies to seek refuge under=20
Pacific Gas & Electric's regulated rates. PG&E has told some cities that=20

"If we don't speak up, big corporations and the Bush administration will=20

The Davis and Bush administrations have traded potshots over the energy=20

=20
As Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., turned up the political pressure on the=20
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, House GOP leaders scuttled an emergen=

bill designed to help power-short California through a difficult summer. Th=

measure became bogged down in partisan wrangling over price controls.=20
Bingaman's message was a sign of the sudden shift in energy politics in=20
Washington after Vermont Sen. James M. Jeffords' switch from Republican to=
=20
independent and the Democrats' taking control of the Senate.=20
In his first day as chairman of the energy panel, Bingaman urged the Bush=

New Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., expressed similar sentiment=

in a letter to Gov. Gray Davis.=20
"Unless FERC takes action," Daschle wrote, "I believe that Congress will ha=

Bingaman is co-sponsor of a bill introduced by Sens. Dianne Feinstein,=20

Because cash-strapped Edison is unable to purchase power, the state's=20

The rate hike, however, does not fully cover the wholesale cost of that=20
power, and there is no guarantee there will not be future increases.=20
"I don't know what the future holds for ratepayers," said Steve Maviglio,=
=20
Gov. Gray Davis' spokesman.=20
"Our goal is to avoid electric-rate shock to business and ratepayers.''=20
The hike comes on top of a 9 percent increase approved in January.=20

This politicization of the ISO is significant because the organization's=20

that a loss of political independence by the ISO will further degrade the=

The FERC hasn't formally accused the ISO of acting improperly, but it is=20

The governance issue, which may appear esoteric, actually cuts to the heart=
=20
of the power crisis in California. State officials feel they have ceded too=

workings of the formerly arcane ISO, a public-benefit corporation formed=20
three years ago amid California's push to deregulate its electricity market=

In January, the Legislature authorized the governor to eject a FERC-approve=

The ISO's chairman says changes in the board structure have made the ISO mo=

reflect the fact that "we're in a state of emergency."=20
In its filing Friday, the ISO took the position that the tighter relationsh=

t=20
that ISO boards be free of control by market participants. Even though the=

In the midst of California's electricity crisis, Gov. Gray Davis and other=

Democrats keep calling for price controls on the wholesale price California=

is charged for power.=20
At his meeting Tuesday with President George W. Bush, Gov. Davis insisted o=
n=20
"some form of price relief" from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission a=
nd=20
promised a lawsuit against the FERC; the president insisted that price=20

Also on Tuesday, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals turned down a suit by=20
California legislators, led by Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, to get=
=20
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to order price controls.
In Congress, Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer are pushing legislati=

But this is folly. Throughout all human history, wage and price controls ha=

lBabylon. The Code of Hammurabi is famous as the "first of the great writte=

=20
"Prominent and wealthy tamkaru [merchants] were no longer found in=20

In the same way, California's price control threats have retarded the=20

ancient China." (This history was written in 1911, before the communist=20

lGreece. When grain prices rose too high in ancient Athens, the government=

appointed "sitonai, corn-buyers, who ... introduced price reductions and=20
rationing," according to historian M.I. Finley. Violators could be put to=

death.=20
In a similar fashion, California Attorney General Bill Lockyer said on May=

22, "I would love to personally escort [Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth] Lay t=
o=20
an 8-by-10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says, 'Hi my=
=20
name is Spike, honey'."
The Greeks also executed inspectors who failed to control prices, something=
=20
that might give pause to California officials plumping for price controls.=
=20
"Despite the high mortality rates for merchants and bureaucrats alike, the=
=20
price of grain continued to rise when supplies were short and continued to=
=20
fall when supply was plentiful," the Heritage authors note.
lRome. The ancient Latins imposed their worst price controls during the=20
tyrannical reign of the emperor Diocletian (284-305 A.D.). According to=20
historian M. Rostovtzeff, the controls brought "great harm" and "terrible=
=20
bloodshed, without bringing any relief. Diocletian shared the pernicious=20
belief of the ancient world in the omnipotence of the state, a belief which=
=20
many modern theorists continue to share with him and with it."=20
Diocletian was forced to abdicate and the controls were lightened, but 60=
=20
years later Julian the Apostate again imposed controls (361-63 A.D.), which=
=20
proved a failure and helped bring about the decline and fall of the Roman=
=20
empire.
lMedieval times. Charlemagne imposed crop price controls in 806. The contro=

In 1330, the government of England fixed wine prices. But prices kept risin=

After the Black Death in 1348 killed one-third of Europe's population,=20
workers were in demand. Governments across Europe imposed wage laws, which=
=20
led to laborers withholding their work and to Wat Tyler's rebellion in=20
England in 1381.
lColonial America. In 1630 in Massachusetts, the General Court fixed wages=
=20
and prices, imposing a fine of 10 shillings on offenders. The controls=20
"lasted about six months and were repealed," the Heritage authors note. The=
=20
government then tried to regulate trade with Indians; that didn't work,=20
either.=20
In Connecticut, "The New Haven Colony was made notorious by its minute=20
inquisition into the details of buying and selling, of eating and dressing=
=20
and of domestic difficulties," noted a history compiled by the Connecticut=
=20
Bureau of Labor Statistics in 1887. "It utterly failed. The people were wis=
e=20
enough to see that it was a failure."
lThe American Revolution. In 1777, Pennsylvania froze commodities used by=
=20
George Washington's continental army to try to help the troops as well as t=
he=20
local population. "The prices of uncontrolled goods, mostly imported, rose =
to=20
record heights," the Heritage book says. "Most farmers kept back their=20
produce, refusing to sell at what they regarded as an unfair price. Some wh=
o=20
had large families to take care of even secretly sold their food to the=20
British who paid in gold."=20
The result was that Washington's continentals "nearly starved to death" at=
=20
Valley Forge. The Continental Congress then adopted a resolution, which rea=
d,=20
"[R]esolved, that it will be recommended to the several states to repeal or=
=20
suspend all laws or resolutions within the said states respectively limitin=

regulating or restraining the Price of any Article, Manufacture or Commodit=
y."
When the controls were removed, prices soared to "80 times their pre-war=20
level for a short period before settling down to a level just greater than=
=20
the pre-war average, where they remained for the next decade," the Heritage=
=20
authors write.
Washington's army then could buy provisions and won the War of Independence=

lThe French Revolution. The first Law of the Maximum "provided that the pri=
ce=20
of grain and flour in each district of France should be the average of loca=
l=20
market prices which were in effect from January to May 1793." This caused=
=20
shortages and popular uprisings so that "by August of that year the May law=
=20
was generally regarded as a dead letter."=20
lWorld War I. The war brought "the most widespread and extensive system of=
=20
economic controls in history." In England after the war, The Economist note=
d=20
in 1919, "[T]he country now can view the results. On every side failure is=
=20
visible and palpable. No single branch of trade which the government has=20
touched shows a success."=20
lNazi Germany. "Nazi price control was more rigorous and elaborate than=20
anything seen earlier in Germany or any other nation," the Heritage authors=
=20
write. However, "even this rigid structure could not prevent all of the=20
problems associated with wage and price controls that basic economic theory=
=20
would predict." The result was a huge black market and shortages, which=20
fortunately damaged Nazi military production. While awaiting trial at=20
Nuremberg, Hermann Goering admitted "trying to control people's wages and=
=20
prices ... . I tried it and failed."=20
lThe Soviet Union. After the Russian Revolution in 1917, the Soviet Union=
=20
imposed "total wage and price control," the book notes. The result was=20
endemic shortages, malnutrition that in the early years led to famines that=
=20
killed millions, a vast black market and the eventual implosion of the Sovi=
et=20
economy.=20
If Nazis and Soviets couldn't maintain effective price controls, even with=
=20
the threat of torture, concentration camps and execution, what makes modern=
=20
governments think they can succeed?
lAmerica in World War II. Price controls were delayed two years apparently=
=20
because the Roosevelt administration saw they didn't work in Germany and=20
Italy. When the controls were imposed, noted economist Milton Friedman, "Ev=
en=20
60,000 bureaucrats backed by 300,000 volunteers plus widespread patriotism=
=20
were unable during World War II to cope with the ingenuity of millions of=
=20
people finding ways to get around price and wage controls that conflicted=
=20
with their individual sense of justice."=20
A personal account comes from a Pennsylvania farmer, Marshall L. Jones, in=
=20
his book Recollections. "There was a normal potato crop in 1943 but prices=
=20
were rising due to war-time demand," he writes. The government then put a=
=20
ceiling on prices. In the past, some farmers stored supplies to get a highe=
r=20
price in the spring. "As a result, all potato growers, including myself, so=
ld=20
their potatoes during the fall and early winter as soon as they reached the=
=20
ceiling price. In the spring of 1944 all potato supplies (except seed) were=
=20
gone ... . It seems that sometimes when governmental agencies interfere wit=
h=20
normal marketing procedures the result is just the opposite of that desired=
."=20
lThe 1970s Malaise. In 1971, President Nixon imposed wage and price control=
s=20
to deal with inflation, ending most of them in 1974. "During this period, t=
he=20
Wholesale Price Index (WPI), nevertheless, increased at an annual rate of 1=
2=20
percent and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased at an annual rate of 7=
.2=20
percent," the Heritage book reports. "Just prior to the freeze, the rate of=
=20
inflation was running about 4.5 percent per annum."=20
The law of supply and demand is as inflexible as the law of gravity. Trying=
=20
to short-circuit it with wage and price controls is pure folly. It hasn't=
=20
worked across 4,000 years and it won't work if imposed in California.
Indeed, much of our problem stems from controls that remain on retail=20
electricity prices. Imposing more controls on wholesale prices would add a=

new chapter to the four millennia of price-control failure.=20

NewsEdge Corporation - ?The Pacific Northwest has reached the halfway point=
 in its effort to hold the ?Bonneville Power Administration's Oct. 1 rate i=

esday. ?"If we stopped where we are today with about 1,200 megawatts of loa=

," ?said Wright. "On the other hand, if we push ahead and get another 1,200=
 ?megawatts, we can reduce the rate hike below 75 percent. We need those ?u=
tilities and industries that have not yet taken action to step up to the ?p=
late." ?Wright said BPA wholesale customers have 16 days left to make commi=
tments to ?reduce their purchases from BPA. The goal is for all customer gr=
oups to ?reduce their overall purchases by 2,400 megawatts. To date, the al=
uminum ?industry has been the biggest contributor to the load reduction eff=
ort, ?having met 75 percent of its share of the load reduction target. ?Pub=
lic and private utilities so far have contributed 11 percent and 25 ?percen=
t, respectively, of their share. In addition, the private utilities are ?al=
so negotiating long-term agreements to reduce their purchases from BPA. ?Wr=
ight noted that some customers can cancel their load reduction commitments =
?if enough other customers do not sign up. That increases the urgency for t=
he ?region to achieve the additional commitments. ?"We could actually lose =
some of the progress we have made on load and rate ?reduction unless the re=

" Wright said. ?BPA is scheduled to issue its final decision June 20. That =
rate structure ?will be submitted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissi=

 Calif., June 6 /PRNewswire/ -- Beginning this week, Southern ?California E=
dison (SCE) customers will see several major changes to their ?utility bill=
s, as directed by the California Public Utilities Commission ?(CPUC) and th=
e governor's office. ?Most notably, SCE bills now contain the "Rotating Out=
age Group" number ?assigned to all customers, which will help them better p=
repare for outages ?during statewide power emergencies. Another addition to=
 the bill is the ?CPUC's newly adopted "tiered-rate" billing structure. And=
 later this month, ?when bills are prepared reflecting June power use, a ne=
w line item called ?"California 20% Rebate" will be added for customers who=
 meet the summer ?conservation requirements of the state's new "20/20" bill=
 rebate program. ?"Whenever major changes are made to the bill, we get a co=
nsiderable number of ?customer inquiries," said Pam Bass, SCE's senior vice=
 president for customer ?service. "That's why our customer care representat=
ives are standing ready to ?help consumers understand the new information a=
nd how they can use it as an ?effective tool to manage their energy costs a=
nd to cope through the ?inconveniences caused by rotating outages." ?Rotati=
ng Outage Group Numbers ?Customers can now find an alphanumeric Rotating Ou=
tage Group number on the ?upper left portion of the bill, next to the servi=
ce account number. This ?number represents a group of circuits -- the small=
est units of the ?distribution grid -- that can be turned on and off to man=
age electrical load ?when SCE is ordered to do so by the California Indepen=
dent System Operator ?(Cal-ISO) during critical power emergencies. ?By know=
ing the rotating outage group to which their homes and businesses are ?assi=
gned, customers will be able to monitor whether they will likely be ?affect=
ed when rotating blackouts are in effect. ?For example, if the news media w=
ere to report that rotating outage groups ?A035 through A045 were likely to=
 be affected in the next round of blackouts, ?customers in group A038 would=
 know that they may be affected and could take ?steps to prepare. With some=
 exceptions, SCE generally interrupts customer ?groups in numerical order, =
based on the amount of electrical load reduction ?required by Cal-ISO when =
power reserves are critically low throughout the ?state. ?Group numbers may=
 change, without advance notice, for operational reasons and ?as the CPUC r=
evises its policy regarding customers exempted from blackouts. ?SCE will no=
tify customers of such changes as quickly as practical. ?Customers are advi=
sed to stay informed of power forecasts every day through ?the news media a=
nd a special online service offered by SCE. A new "pop-up" ?window automati=
cally greets visitors who click onto SCE's Web site ?(www.sce.com), which p=
rovides a wide range of rotating blackout information. ?When outages are in=
 effect, the site will display a chronological listing of ?group numbers an=
d communities that were previously interrupted, those that ?are currently b=
eing interrupted and group numbers and communities that are ?likely to be a=
ffected next (if blackouts are expected to continue). SCE will ?offer simil=
ar information through its toll-free number, (800) 611-1911. ?Before callin=
g, customers should have both their service account and rotating ?outage gr=
oup numbers available. ?New Tiered-Rate Structure ?The CPUC's newly adopted=
 "tiered-rate" structure now appears on residential ?bills, showing up to f=
ive tiers of energy consumption and the escalating ?surcharges applied to e=
ach tier. Customers who use more will pay more. ?Those who use 130% or less=
 of their "baseline" allocation (Tiers 1 & 2) are ?exempt from any rate inc=
rease, as are those income-qualified customers ?participating in the CARE p=
rogram. However, consumption above this level will ?be billed at higher tie=
r levels in the form of surcharges authorized by the ?CPUC. Customers whose=
 usage reaches Tier 5, for example, will pay the highest ?surcharge for eac=
h kWh exceeding 300% of their baseline allocation. ?The structure was desig=
ned to encourage conservation and to recover the cost ?for wholesale electr=
icity purchased for customers by the California ?Department of Water Resour=
ces. These charges are being collected by SCE only ?as an agent for CDWR. ?=
California 20/20 Rebate Program ?Later this month, a new line item, "Califo=
rnia 20% Rebate," will appear on ?the bills of those customers who use at l=
east 20% less electricity than for ?the same period last year. A 20% bill c=
redit will be applied to the bills of ?qualifying customers for their usage=
 in June, July, August and September. ?SCE has launched a comprehensive pub=
lic information effort to help consumers ?understand the new bill changes, =
ways to conserve energy, and to reinforce ?the importance of preparation an=
