Hi, Jeff --

That would be great!  I understand that things are crazy.  And I can
imagine, looking ahead to January's start of the legislative season, that
it will only get nuttier.  Let me know what your schedule is like, and I
can meet you near where you'll be having meetings.

Looking forward to it --
