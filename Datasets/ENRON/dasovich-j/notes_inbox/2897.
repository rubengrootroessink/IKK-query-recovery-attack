Energy Committee Members:
I apologize for the influx of e-mail from my desk, however, I have only
received a few RSVP's for the Energy Committee meeting scheduled for next
Wednesday, May 30.  It is imperative that we know before close of business
today exactly how many members plan on attending the meeting.  As I
explained in a previous e-mail, we have two possible hosts set up for
Wednesday's meeting, depending on how many members the facility can
accomodate.  Out of respect for the two companies that have kindly offered
their facility to our group, I must confirm with one of them today.  Please,
if you plan to attend the next Energy Committee meeting, RSVP by responding
to this e-mail before 5pm today.  Thank you.
