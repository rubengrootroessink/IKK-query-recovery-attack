that recently set a Wall Street record for new issues by
companies without revenues, raising $1.1 billion in its IPO
at a market capitalization of $11 billion.
--Scott Kriens of Juniper Networks, the young maker of
high-speed Internet equipment whose shares have risen
tenfold since IPO.
--David Peterschmidt of Inktomi, the network-caching
