Something to ponder on election day.... 

Bush Inaugural Address Song 

(to the tune of "What a Wonderful World" by Sam Cooke) 

Don't know much about history 
Don't know much foreign policy 
Don't remember how I got through school 
I'm sure I didn't break the rules 
But what's it matter 'cause my granny says 
"Boy, if you want to you can be the prez 
And what a wonderful world this will be" 

Don't know much about the women's vote 
Don't know much about the bill I wrote 
Don't know much about the foreign vets 
I've never voted for 'em yet 
But I do know if your dad tries hard 
He can get you in the National Guard 
And what a wonderful place that can be 

Now I never claimed to be an A student 
But what's wrong with C's? 
And maybe by knowing the names of my cabinet 
I can win their love for me 

Don't know much about air pollution
Don't know much about the constitution 
Don't know much about th'economy 
It never much affected me 

But there's one thing that I know for sure 
If the rich stay rich and the poor stay poor 
What a wonderful world this will be 

Don't know much about the national debt 
I've never had to pay one yet 
If we need to we can sell the States 
To the Japanese at discount rates 
But I do know if things get bad 
Dick and I can always call my dad 
And what a wonderful world this will be.
