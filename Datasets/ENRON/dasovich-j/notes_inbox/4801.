ENRON
* Summary - outstanding meeting with a world-class F500 company, these
people understand Strategic Sourcing, there are multiple opportunities
within this account, nice work by David Young to get us in front of the
right people
* Derryl's group (50 people) handles Strategic Sourcing (SS) across 8 major
spend categories for the company (IT/Telco, Pipes/Valves/Fittings, Admin
Svcs, Travel & Entertainment, etc...)
* They currently run a very sophisticated, off-line SS process but... have
ZERO tools to manage this process on-line and are desperate for better
information pre and post sourcing events
* Their SS process is slow (the target for each sourcing event is 90 days,
although many run beyond this) and they are frustrated by the lack of
information available from their SAP system
* Our solution was a direct hit with their needs - the marriage of Perfect
Buyer/Supplier to speed up their req2select process was compelling, the PPD
was a hit (as usual), and Perfect Insight will be huge win for them
* Next steps - they want us to come back and show the product with some of
their info (custom demo), we will also hit other areas of the company
identified in the mtg as potential users of our solution
