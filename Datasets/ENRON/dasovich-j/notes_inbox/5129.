THE FRIDAY BURRITO=20

He who laughs last thinks slowest.=20

Which part of the energy crisis did you enjoy this week? Unlike default=20
electric service, when it comes to California disasters, you have a wide=20
range of choices among competing options.? For example, there was the=20
Governor, our Governor preaching the gospel among the Democratic Governors =
in=20
Washington, D.C., and the financial analysts in New York City.? In=20
Sacramento, there was Senate Energy Committee hearings.? And from the poiso=
n=20
tipped pens of the Department of Market Analysis at the ISO there was a=20
report that I can assure you will stir the pot.? Which event was your=20
favorite?=20

This was a Holy Week, of sorts, for Catholics.? Tuesday was Fat Tuesday, an=
d=20
Wednesday was Ash Wednesday.? I saw a married couple in Starbucks on=20
Wednesday night that had ashen smudges on their forehead.? At a distance I=
=20
wasn't sure about the marking.? At first I only saw the woman waiting for h=
er=20
coffee order.?? I assumed she was marked as an Untouchable, you know, the=
=20
Indian type, although she looked more Eastern European than Indian.? You=20
never know.? I couldn't figure out how her marking was so indistinct becaus=
e=20
the Untouchable tattoo is a very bright color.? It wasn't until I saw her=
=20
husband, also marked on his forehead in the same way, that I realized the=
=20
meaning of the symbol, the day and its significance.? When I lived in=20
Chicago, a long time ago, and worked downtown in the Loop, I would see thre=
e=20
out of four adults either at work or on the street with the Ash Wednesday=
=20
indicia on their forehead.? I haven't seen the same interest in religious=
=20
practice for all the 23 years I have lived in California. Amazing the thing=
s=20
one can learn while sipping a Grande Non-fat Chai Tea at Starbucks.? Do you=
=20
think there could be one day a year where people would wear the following=
=20
insignia on their forehaead?=20

[IMAGE]

I don't often go to Starbucks at night.? A caffeine beverage keeps me awake=
.?=20
However, when my son is at his ice-hockey practice in Belmont, visiting the=
=20
local coffeehouse in order to kill time is just too tempting.? I watch=20
people, sip coffee, and hunt for a used newspaper to read.? For some reason=
=20
last Wednesday evening, I checked my voice mail, just in case someone left =
me=20
a message about a mistake in my favor on my bank account.? Instead, a=20
reporter from the Orange County Register called me at 7:30 p.m., and asked =
me=20
to return his call.? Having nothing better to do than watch people take=20
communion at the coffee bar and contemplate how Untouchable tattoos can tur=
n=20
gray, I called the reporter.? He answered the phone.? He wanted to know my=
=20
(meaning your) reaction to the ISO's study to be filed at FERC explaining h=
ow=20
generators have overcharged the ISO relative to their likely operating cost=
s=20
for real time energy? The amounts of the overcharges for December and Janua=
ry=20
are alleged in the study to be hundreds of millions of dollars.? As always,=
 I=20
was equipped with sufficient ignorance to provide a meaningful quote.? I=20
said, "Huh?"=20

He went on.? Did I think the study was politically motivated by the Governo=
r=20
Davis' hand-picked ISO Governing Board?? This time I nailed the answer.? I=
=20
said, "What?"? Actually, I backed away from entangling myself in the finger=
=20
pointing game.? It was tempting to indulge, I might add, but I didn't do it=
.?=20
I said, "No, the politics wouldn't change this outcome.? The ISO has a righ=
t=20
to ask for an audit of the bids, and they did.? Simple."? Maybe I'm right, =
or=20
maybe I'm wrong.? Who knows?=20

Last week, I received an e-mail from ISO Governing Board member Michael Pet=
er=20
Florio, a cat I long ago nicknamed Old Deuteronomy, for reasons I can no=20
longer remember.? Deut responded to a comment I made to him that Mr. Florio=
=20
is the most senior and knowledgeable member of the ISO Governing Board.? Th=
at=20
isn't surprising, I told Deut, but it does speak volumes about the current=
=20
Board's composition.? Deut wrote back, "That's comforting, I think.? I trie=
d=20
to make the point after Kent Palmerton [Williams Energy] spoke at the last=
=20
public comment period that I want to hear what people think about issues=20
coming up at the ISO, even if requires use of personal e-mail to bypass the=
=20
ISO.? Despite all the anguished rhetoric, we all have to live together, wor=
k=20
together, and understand each other going forward."? Deut asked me to put=
=20
that in the Burrito, so I did.=20

But as Governor's go, it gives me a heartache to listen to our State=20
Governor.? This man is a one-act disaster.? I suppose we Californian's get=
=20
what we deserve.? The Gov's comment this week to a group in Washington D.C.=
=20
floored me.? He said, and I am not making this up, that California is on th=
e=20
backside of the electricity crisis problem.? I thought that comment deserve=
d=20
some special attention. When a San Francisco Chronicle reporter asked for m=
y=20
opinion, I couldn't shut up. I exclaimed, "Backside of the problem?? No. I=
=20
think we are on the dark side of the moon.? If we don't turn this thing=20
around, there won't be any light."? Huff, and puff.=20

Bankruptcy or not to bankrupt, that is the question.? Here is my take on th=
e=20
issue, this week.? By next week I should have an entirely different answer.=
?=20
If PG&E folds, that is accepts a deal with the State to sell its transmissi=
on=20
assets, then it would appear as if the utilities are serious about remainin=
g=20
financial whole, and working out their payments with creditors.? Clearly,=
=20
there is many a slip 'tween the cup and the lip.? Creditors could demand mo=
re=20
than the utilities have received from the sale of the assets.? My crude=20
analysis suggests that after the utilities pay off the bonds and obligation=
s=20
secured by the transmission assets, there might not be enough money to cove=
r=20
the outstanding balances with the unsecured creditors.? The remaining open=
=20
question, then, is will the PUC allow as a cost the pass through of=20
additional revenue requirements to fully cover the amounts owed?? It seems=
=20
these days, the PUC can do, and does anything it wants, with or without leg=
al=20
procedure.? Of course, most of what they do make things worse, but, hey, th=
at=20
is why we have a PUC. I noticed that the PUC informed the world that any=20
power purchases made by DWR will be deemed just and reasonable.? Now why=20
couldn't they say the same thing to the utilities for their long-term power=
=20
purchase deals?=20

Let's put some hot coffee on the burner, and see what we can brew.=20

?@@@ Community Choice may be a Savior of Direct Access=20

ABx1 1 suspended all new direct access customers in California until the DW=
R=20
no longer purchases energy.? This will occur when our grandchildren graduat=
e=20
from college.? Although clean up legislation has been suggested to reverse=
=20
this crippling effect of ABx1 1, I am not hopeful. Alas, our friend from=20
Local Power, Paul Fenn located in Oakland has found, at long last, a sponso=
r=20
for his proposed bill to allow communities to select energy providers other=
=20
than the incumbent utilities.? Here are the details.=20

Assemblywoman Carole Migden (D-San Francisco) announced her sponsorship of=
=20
the California Community Choice bill (drafted by Local Power last year) on=
=20
February 15. A hearing will be announced shortly and could be as early as=
=20
next week.=20

Local Power has also submitted an amendment to ABx1 48 to facilitate=20
"distributed generation" in urban areas, such as solar, wind, small hydro,=
=20
fuel cells, etc. This amendment will be heard at the same time. This bill=
=20
would allow a city (for example) to assign power on a real time basis from =
a=20
solar cell or other local generation at one location in a city to "load=20
points" elsewhere in the city on the same distribution system.? The languag=
e=20
would enable many forms of distributed generation to develop, but would be=
=20
particularly valuable for Community Choice cities to jump-start large scale=
=20
urban solar, wind, fuel cell, small hydro and other local power projects.=
=20

Community Choice is the solution to California's failure to implement retai=
l=20
access in any meaningful way. Local governments are authorized to aggregate=
=20
all market non-participants in their jurisdictions into city-negotiated=20
contracts, much like cable television or garbage services have been=20
negotiated for decades, but with an opt-out clause for consumers who are ab=
le=20
to participate directly in the market. Groups of contiguous municipalities=
=20
may join together, and county governments may coordinate consenting=20
municipalities in regional power contracts.=20

Things in the People's Republic of California=20
?@@@ And the Award for the Silliest Bill Goes to ABX1 70=20

Each week our State Legislators try to outdo each other.? I think they meet=
=20
at a local watering hole in Sacramento, and dare each other to see who can=
=20
come up with the most absurd emergency-session energy bill.? We have a new=
=20
winner, Assembly Member La Suer, and it is called ABx1 70.? Here is what th=
is=20
odious piece of legislation is all about.=20

ABX1 70 attempts to criminalize acts of unregulated generators if they=20
perform maintenance at times other than the California Public Utilities=20
Commission requires. Further, the commission is required to allow scheduled=
=20
maintenance of only one generator at a time.=20

I can hear you out-of-state Burrito readers howling with laughter, slapping=
=20
your thighs, and shaking your heads.? "Hey Joe, listen to this.? A guy name=
d=20
La Sewer is forcing generators to be out on maintenance only one at a time.=
"?=20
I admit, there is a certain amount of disbelief that anyone who can read,=
=20
write, and run for the California Assembly could actually craft this bill.?=
=20
If you want to have some fun, then in the above paragraph, replace the word=
=20
"maintenance" with the word "sex", and the word "generator" with "utility=
=20
executive(s)".? We might call Milton-Bradley to see if they want a piece of=
=20
the action on our new game.? We=01,ll call it Legendary.=20

Shall we analyze the impacts?? Let's see, there are about 500 major=20
generators in the state.? That means if you own one of those puppies, you c=
an=20
go down for maintenance once every ten years.? That works for me.=20

It reminds me of a story about the communist government that once ruled the=
=20
USSR.? A Russian asks a plumber when he can come to this house to fix a=20
leak.? The plumber opens his appointment book, and says, "The soonest I can=
=20
fit you in, Comrade, is in February, 2004."? "What day?" asks the Russian.=
=20
The plumber rubs his chin and contemplates an answer, "February 8," he=20
answers.? "Morning or afternoon," asks the Russian.? "Afternoon," answers t=
he=20
plumber.? "Good," says the Russian with a sigh of relief, "the electrician =
is=20
coming in the morning."=20

The bill, if enacted, will allow generators to be out for maintenance durin=
g=20
the peak season, which is rapidly becoming all year long in California.?=20
Well, I would like you people to do me a favor.? Let's play the same game=
=20
that the Legislators like to play in Sacramento.? Think of the most=20
outrageous legislation you can imagine, and write it down on a piece of=20
paper.? Wait a few weeks, and I bet you will see legislation proposed in=20
California that makes your suggestion look pale in comparison.? Stick aroun=
d=20
here long enough, and either you are nuts, or you will be.=20

?@@@ Creditor's Committee for Power Marketers, Out of State Generators, and=
=20
Public Power Entities=20

Several good-news points to tell you regarding the formation of a creditor'=
s=20
committee for those among you who are feeling disenfranchised.? Worry not.?=
=20
You are in good company.=20

The WPTF Board this week provided guidelines for your favorite executive=20
director to apply his organizational skills to facilitate the development o=
f=20
a creditor's committee. I have targeted WPTF members who either have=20
expressed an interest in joining a committee, or those who might be among=
=20
unsecured creditors that want to protect their ability to recover amounts=
=20
owed to them by PG&E, and SCE, through the ISO and the PX.? Any creditor's=
=20
committee so developed will be independent and unaffiliated with WPTF.? Tha=
t=20
is understandable and necessary so that WPTF's status as a tax-exempt trade=
=20
association is not effected with credit issues of individual members.=20

I have talked to many out-of-state generators, power marketers, and in-stat=
e=20
public power agencies about the formation of a committee, and the interest =
is=20
very high.? Here is why.? If SCE and PG&E both strike deals with the state =
to=20
sell their transmission assets to raise some or all of the cash to pay back=
=20
due amounts, there is an increasing likelihood that the debtors, the=20
utilities, will try to stave off bankruptcy.? A creditor's committee is ver=
y=20
valuable in that instance.? A committee of like-minded creditor's with=20
similar objectives will give participants a window and a voice into the=20
disbursement of payments the debtors will make to all creditors.=20

Saybrook Capital will represent the interests of the committee once formed.=
?=20
Saybrook will seek recognition of the committee from the debtors, and becom=
e=20
a pipeline of information between the creditors and the debtors, and vice=
=20
versa.? If there is any member among our group who I have not talked to, an=
d=20
thinks your interests would be aligned with the targeted participants, eith=
er=20
give me a call or send me an e-mail.? I will be happy to provide you with t=
he=20
information you need to participate.? An organizational meeting of the=20
committee is scheduled for the middle of next week.? If your company or=20
organization is unable to join a creditor's committee now, but might be abl=
e=20
to in the future, then there should be no problem.? Being involved with the=
=20
committee at the front end provides participants with an opportunity to cra=
ft=20
the objectives and goals of the group.? Participation at a later date shoul=

be open. For information about Saybrook Capital, please call Jonathon=20
