Thanks a lot. That sounds perfect. I'll give my mom Sharon's number, and she
can call her and get a feel for things through her. About Jay's, I can get
her to chill on that. I think that she's just generally excited, so anything
sounds good. She just needs to come up first, and worry about other things
later. And we can just let you think about what you want to do, and see what
Jay has in mind all in good time. I totally inderstand wanting to approach
him in the way that works best for you. I am at my office at 922-3430.
Thanks again!
