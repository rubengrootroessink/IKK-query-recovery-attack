With Laura Tyson's complete and unwavering commitment to this project, we
can now move ahead.  I have not as yet decided whether it makes most sense
to do this through LECG alone, or jointly through LECG and UC.  The latter
is quite possible.  Let's figure out what's appropriate, given LECG's and
the University's complex conflict of interest and conflict of commitment
rules.  We will certainly get the job done and stay well within any rules
which may be pertinent.  Hence, for the meantime at least, let's think of
this project as a hybrid.

I believe the ball is now in your court to "sell" this to an industry
consortium.  I am of course willing to help if necessary.

PS -- I believe Tom Campbell will join the team enthusiastically after
January 7th when his term in the House expires.  Tom and Laura are
exceptionally talented and can work together.
