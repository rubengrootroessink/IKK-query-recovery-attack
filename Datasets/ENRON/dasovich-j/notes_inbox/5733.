DTE fines Sprint for 'slamming'

The Department of Telecommunications and Energy has ordered Sprint Corp.
to pay a $1,000 penalty for switching a customer's interexchange service
from AT&T Corp. to Sprint without obtaining the customer's
authorization.

The DTE said state law requires it to impose of a civil penalty if it
finds a carrier guilty of "slamming" more than once in the same 12-month
period.  Sprint slammed another customer in June, the department said,
making this the second offense.

The department said Sprint offered in its defense "conclusory statements
that this was not a Sprint slam."  The DTE concluded, however, that "the
absence of any individual from Sprint to authorize or to authenticate or
to submit to cross-examination on these documents renders them
self-serving and unpersuasive."  (DTE 00-22-12)

Sen. Harp aims to prevent prisons from profiting from collect calls

Sen. Toni N. Harp (D., District 10) has introduced SB 418 to ensure that
the state's Department of Corrections doesn't profit from prisoners'
collect calls to their families.  The bill would require the department
to use the proceeds it receives from a provider of inmates' collect
calls to fund "occupational training" for the inmates.

The bill has been referred to the Committee on Judiciary.  Its text is
available at
http://www.cga.state.ct.us/2001/tob/s/2001SB-00418-R00-SB.htm.

INTERNET
MISSISSIPPI
Senate measure takes aim at Web seductions of minors

Sen. Terry C. Burton (D., District 31) has introduced a bill to prohibit
using the Internet to distribute "indecent materials" with the intent of
seducing a minor.  SB 2146 would amend section 97-5-27 of the
Mississippi Code of 1972 to address the issue of "computer luring."

The proposed amendment would define computer luring as using a computer
both to send sexually oriented material to a minor and to induce the
minor to engage in sexual acts.  Computer luring would be a felony
punishable by a jail term of up to three years and a fine of up to
$10,000.

In any computer luring lawsuit, SB 2146 would allow a defendant to argue
that he or she "made a reasonable effort" to determine the minor's age
and couldn't do so because of actions on the part of the minor.  Another
valid defense under SB 2146 would be that the defendant made a
reasonable effort to prevent minors from obtaining objectionable
content.

According to SB 2146, a person couldn't be convicted "solely for
providing access or connection to or from a facility, system, or network
not under that person's control."  Employers couldn't be held liable for
the actions of an employee under the proposed amendment unless those
actions related to the employee's work, or the employer authorized or
"recklessly" ignored the activities.

SB 2146 has been referred to the Senate Juvenile Justice Committee.

INTERNET
OREGON
Bill would form Internet commission to oversee E-commerce

Rep. Jim Hill (R., District 5) has introduced HB 2470 to establish a
15-member Oregon Internet Commission to oversee the development of
electronic commerce in Oregon and any strategies implemented by the
state.

The commission would include two members from the Senate, two members
from the House, and 11 gubernatorial appointees.  The gubernatorial
appointees would have to possess experience with electronic and Internet
commerce issues.

The bill would direct the commission to submit recommendations to the
Department of Administrative Services or other state agencies for
improving citizens' access to information resources and technology.

HB 2470 states that Oregon "must oppose additional unnecessary or
unwarranted regulations that would impede increased access to the
Internet, market competition, consumer choice, security of personal
information, or the conducting of electronic commerce actions."

HB 2470 awaits committee referral.

COMPETITIVE LOCAL ENTRY
MARYLAND
Lawmakers want task force to monitor, promote competition

Del. Joan F. Stern, (D., District 39) has introduced HB 137 to establish
a task force to "encourage and monitor competition" among telecom
providers.  Legislators, representatives of the executive branch, the
Public Service Commission, and industry would sit on the 17-member task
force.

The task force would be charged with studying the state of competition
and recommending measures "for removing barriers to increased
competition among" telecom providers.  The bill has been referred to the
Committee on Environmental Matters.

INTERNET
INDIANA
Bill would require libraries to restrict minors' access to Web porn

A bill has been introduced in the House to require libraries to adopt
and enforce an Internet online policy restricting minors' access to Web
sites that contain obscene material.  HB 2113 has been referred to the
Committee on Commerce, Economic Development, and Technology.

The measure would restrict the amount of state funds designated for
libraries failing to adopt and enforce the policy.

CUSTOMER-AFFECTING
CONNECTICUT
Bill would prohibit fee for unlisted phone numbers

Rep. Ted Graziani (D., District 57) has introduced HB 6169 to prohibit
providers from charging fees for unlisted or unpublished telephone
numbers.  According to the legislative staff, the measure is intended to
reduce barriers to obtaining unlisted number for consumers, especially
"those individuals who have heightened privacy interests, such as
victims of abuse, or those who are divorced or separated from their
spouses."

HB 6169 has been referred to the Committee on Energy and Technology.
Its text is available at

WIRELESS
OREGON
Bill would bar drivers' use of handheld, hands-free wireless phones

Oregon lawmakers will be considering a bill during the 2001 legislative
session that would increase the penalties drivers could face after
committing a traffic offense while talking on a mobile telephone.  SB
190 would define a mobile telephone as "a handheld or hands-free device
designed to receive and transmit voice communication."

Under the bill, the base fine for any traffic offense while using a
mobile phone would be 80% of the maximum fine set for the offense.  This
is the same penalty structure used for drivers that commit a traffic
offense in a highway work zone.

SB 190, which was sponsored by Sen. Avel Gordly (D., District 10),
awaits consideration by the Senate General Government and Transportation
Committee.

IOWA
Mechanicsville to receive '563' area code

The Utilities Board has denied a request by the Bridge Community Bank in
Mechanicsville for reconsideration of the board's decision to move the
Mechanicsville exchange under the new "563" area code.  In October 2000
the board adopted a "split" to relieve NXX code exhaustion in the "319"
area code.  (10/30/00 a.m.)  The new 563 area code will serve the area
being split from 319.

In December 2000 the board moved the Mechanicsville exchange from 319 to
563 because of technical network requirements and to keep the North
Cedar Community School District in a single area code.

In rejecting the bank's request, the board said the bank hadn't
identified any "unique or unusual burden" imposed on Mechanicsville
exchange customers as a result of the assignment.  (Docket no. SPU-99-30
