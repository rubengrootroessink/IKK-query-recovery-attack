May 8,  2001?

To:????????????Cal-Tax?Board  of Directors and?Interested?Parties???
From:????????Ron  Roach, Communications Director??
Subject:????Update  of Windfall Profits Tax  Legislation?

The following is advance  Caltaxletter coverage of  the May 7 California=20
Legislature's actions on two bills that would impose  "windfall profits"=20
taxes on producers of electricity:??
?
SENATE APPROVES =01&WINDFALL PROFITS=018 TAX AS ROLLING BLACKOUTS  HIT?????=
?

Nearly coinciding with rolling blackouts plaguing  California for the first=
=20
time since mid-March, the Senate on Monday approved a  =01&windfall profits=
=018 tax=20
on energy producers (SB 1X, Soto). Critics said  the measure establishes a=
=20
perverse tax incentive not to sell power in California  and will reduce=20
electricity supply even further, increasing prospects of future  blackouts.=
??

Twenty-five  Democrats voted =01&aye=018 on SB 1X, while 12 Republicans vot=
ed=20
against it.  Because the bill did not pass with 27 votes, or two-thirds of=
=20
the Senate as  required by Proposition 13, there will likely be a court=20
challenge on this  point.

Meanwhile,  just hours earlier, the Assembly Revenue and Taxation Committee=
=20
approved a  slightly different version of a =01&windfall profits=018 tax (A=
B 128X, =20
Corbett), despite the fact that the bill was substantially amended at the =
=20
hearing.

SB  1X imposes a 100 percent excise tax on sales of electricity at a price=
=20
above  $80 per megawatt-hour. It also establishes a refundable tax credit=
=20
equal to the  amount of revenue generated by the tax.

AB 128X establishes a retroactive (to January 1,  2001) sliding-scale tax o=
f=20
50 percent of gross receipts on electricity sales  over $60 per=20
megawatt-hour; 70 percent of the gross receipts of sales over $90  per=20
megawatt-hour, and 90 percent of gross receipts of sales over $120 per =20
megawatt-hour. The rate of tax can be changed =01&from time to time=018 by =
the =20
California Public Utilities Commission. ?The bill will likely tax sales not=
 =20
made in California, because it defines =01&sales of electricity to a retail=
er=018=20
in  California to be the higher of the ratio of sales in California to the=
=20
total  sales or percentage of total electricity sales everywhere, using a=
=20
ratio  of total sales everywhere in the year 2000 to sales in California in=
=20
the year  2000.?

Debate in the Senate was hotter than the 95-degree  temperature outside.=20
Democrat Senator Steve Peace, who is generally given credit  for pushing th=
e=20
electricity deregulation bill through the Legislature in 1996,  became high=
ly=20
emotional in denouncing energy producers.?

Continuing to blame the California crisis on the  Federal Energy Regulation=
=20
Commission (FERC), as well as Harvey Rosenfield=01,s  Proposition 9, which=
=20
sought to unravel deregulation in 1998 and caused a  two-year delay in=20
construction of additional power plants, Senator Peace called  SB 1X the=20
=01&only reasonable alternative.=018? He said it will bring competition to =
the =20
market with rules and =01&a referee who will blow the whistle.=018 He descr=
ibed=20
FERC  as =01&the proverbial cop in the donut shop who refuses to enforce th=
e=20
law=018 and  limit what wholesalers can charge.?

Republican Senator Ray Haynes said the tax would not  bring additional=20
electricity to Californians. =01&We are going to make sure by  passing this=
 bill=20
that the lights will go out,=018 he said.??

Democrat Senator Debra Bowen said the prospect of  taxing excess profits=20
=01&will grab (energy producers) by the horns and their  hearts and minds w=
ill=20
follow.=018?

Republican Senator Tom McClintock said the tax would  cut supplies of=20
electricity, noting that other states, such as Texas and Nevada,  are=20
building, or will build, power plants to serve California with investments =
=20
that benefit those states=01, economies, not California=01,s. =01&To make e=
lectricity =20
cheap, we have to make it plentiful. This is a very wrong step in a very=20
wrong  direction,=018 he said.?

At the Assembly committee hearing, numerous speakers  sought to testify for=
=20
and against the bill. However, Democrat Assembly Member  Helen Thomson=20
(chosen by Committee Chair Ellen Corbett to preside instead of the =20
Republican vice-chair, which in itself was unusual) limited testimony to tw=
o =20
witnesses on each side.?

Speaking for the tax were Jean Ross, executive  director of the California=
=20
Budget Project, and Lenny Goldberg, of the California  Tax Reform=20
Association, organizations funded largely by public employee unions  or=20
liberal-leaning foundations that generally oppose tax relief and support =
=20
increased government spending. Ms. Ross urged immediate action, saying=20
consumers  will be paying 1.5 percent of their income on power purchases in=
=20
the next year.  Mr. Goldberg called the proposal a viable and realistic=20
solution, which he said  he hopes is constitutional.??

Providing opposition testimony were Carrie-Lee Coke,  representing the=20
California Manufacturers and Technology Association, and Steven  Kelly of t=
he=20
Independent Energy Producers.?  Ms. Coke said the bill is a disincentive to=
=20
more supply and will make the  current crisis worse. She said it also appli=
es=20
to the cogeneration operations of  California manufacturers. Mr. Kelly told=
=20
the committee that the bill jeopardizes  plans for as much as $10 billion i=
n=20
private capital investment in new California  power plants.??

A number of others were allowed to state their  affiliations and their=20
positions on the bill. Among supporters were the  California Labor Federati=
on=20
and the California Public Interest Research Group.  Opposition included the=
=20
California Chamber of Commerce, InterGen, and BP?Amoco.?

Committee Member Elaine Alquist asked to be a co-author  of the bill, sayin=
g=20
it is about time =01&we did something.=018??AB 128X was  approved by a 5-0 =
vote,=20
with Republicans abstaining. Assembly Member Mark Wyland  said he abstained=
=20
because he believes that while California is being gouged by  high energy=
=20
prices, the bill is anti-free market and incentives are needed to  develop=
=20
more power to avoid blackouts.?

Meanwhile, Governor Gray Davis =01&is open to the idea=018 of  such a tax, =
but has=20
not endorsed either bill, said his press secretary, Steve  Maviglio. =01&It=
 just=20
depends on the bill.=018??????
