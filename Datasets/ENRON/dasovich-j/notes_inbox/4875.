Dylan,
Write up looks good to me.  I added a new exhibit 6 worksheet to your
spreadsheet.  It's a simple graph of X vs a.  You may want to add it to the
report as an illustration of the relationship.  I'm at work and was having
trouble adding an arrow to indicate which direction was good to BF Goodrich.
Since your the IT manager I thought it would be no problem for you.  Anyway,
nice job on the report!
