Jeff,

I am attaching a final version of your declaration for your signature.  Mike 
Smith added a few small changes, which you will see.  If you have any 
additional comments or revisions, let me know as soon as possible.  Once you 
have signed the declaration, please federal express the original to me:

Kristen Bird
Quinn Emanuel Urquhart Oliver & Hedges, LLP
895 South Figueroa Street, 10th Floor
Los Angeles, CA 90017-2543

Also, please send a fax copy of your signature page to Diane Hutnyan at 
415.986.5707 as soon as possible.  She is at our Quinn Emanuel office in San 
Francisco and is helping with the actual filing.  Also, please let me know 
when you have signed and faxed the declaration.  My direct dial is 
213.615.8774.
Thanks again for your help Jeff.

Regards,
Kristen

 - Dasovich.
