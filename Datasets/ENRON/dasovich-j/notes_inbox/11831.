BANDWIDTH BEAT: Enron Readies For Life After Watermelon

A Dow Jones Newswires Column=20

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Listen. Do you hear that giant sucking sound? It's th=
e=20
watermelon being sucked out of the bandwidth market.
Two years ago this month, Jeff Skilling, now chief executive and president =
of=20
Enron Corp. (ENE), told Dow Jones Newswires that the Internet high-bandwidt=
h=20
area of the telecommunications market was growing faster than the wholesale=
=20
energy market.=20
"Enron is positioned in the heart of that watermelon," he said.=20
Skilling's watermelon hype has been replaced by talk of burn rate. Last wee=
k=20
during a conference call with analysts, he said Enron must reduce its=20
operating expenses, because losses at Enron Broadband Services exploded to=
=20
$102 million in the second quarter from $8 million in the same period last=
=20
year.=20
Skilling promised to cut expenses quickly. Enron is closing the broadband=
=20
services office in Portland, Ore. It will redeploy some of those employees=
=20
and lay off others.=20
An Enron spokeswoman said Monday that Ken Rice, chairman and chief executiv=
e=20
of the broadband unit, would move to an as-yet undetermined corporate job i=
n=20
two weeks.=20
In addition to trimming bandwidth losses, Enron's taking a step that could=
=20
trim their visibility.=20
Enron reports results from Wholesale Services, Retail Energy Services,=20
Transportation and Distribution, and Broadband Services. No longer. As of t=
he=20
third quarter of this year, Enron Broadband Services will become a business=
=20
unit within Enron Wholesale Services. That move will "make it easier for=20
Enron to hide the losses," one analyst said.=20
For reporting purposes, Enron will treat broadband as it treats wholesale=
=20
markets for weather, metals, lumber and steel. In second quarter results=20
released last week, Enron said it more than doubled delivered volumes in ea=
ch=20
of those commodities, but it didn't give information on income from any of=
=20
them.=20
If the company's broadband business had been lumped into Wholesale Services=
=20
in the second quarter, the company could have said simply and accurately th=
at=20
delivered volumes in broadband increased more than sevenfold during the=20
second quarter. The broadband losses of $102 million before interest and=20
taxes could have been rolled into the wholesale business income of $802=20
million, leaving still-impressive income of $700 million for the quarter.=
=20
Cutbacks Par For The Course=20

Enron isn't alone in looking for ways to cut expenses in the broadband=20
sector. Telecom carriers and equipment makers have been laying off thousand=
s=20
of employees this year in an effort to cut billions of dollars in losses.=
=20
"It's not pretty out there," a consultant said.=20
Keith Shoemaker, a senior trader at Aquila Energy Corp. (ILA), has left the=
=20
company's broadband unit for its energy business. There isn't enough real=
=20
trading now in bandwidth to require the services of a senior trader, Sushil=
=20
Nelson, general manager of Aquila's broadband unit, told Dow Jones Newswire=
s.=20
"If you look at total sales of any network companies, the real sales - by=
=20
carriers on down the chain - are a fraction of what they were a year ago,"=
=20
said Harold Kamins, a managing director for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. As =
a=20
result, trading has diminished at least the same amount.=20
A liquid market for bandwidth trading is now expected to be six to 18 month=
s=20
away, according to predictions by Enron's Skilling, Aquila's Nelson and=20
others.=20
There's still a future for commodity trading in telecom, because companies=
=20
want to avoid big capital outlays for laying and lighting networks and want=
=20
to preserve cash, said Ciara Ryan, leader of Arthur Andersen's bandwidth=20
trading team.=20
Rather than each company building a network to link all the cities in Europ=
e,=20
in North America or throughout the globe, companies need to cooperate more,=
=20
she said. If a company has unused capacity, it can raise revenue by selling=
=20
it to a competitor. When it needs capacity not covered by its network, it c=
an=20
buy it from a competitor.=20
That more efficient approach means carriers would be more interested in two=
=20
requisites for trading - a more standardized contract and more widespread=
=20
interconnectivity.=20
They want to preserve capital, manage cash flow and earn more from network=
=20
assets, Ryan said. That means bandwidth trading will reflect less the hype=
=20
drummed up by the energy players and more a solid business rationale.=20
Energy companies will remain players in telecom despite what they expect wi=
ll=20
be a lull in trading. Enron will concentrate on intermediation as well as=
=20
network services and the content business, Skilling said last week during t=
he=20
conference call.=20
He pointed to a deal Enron has done recently to provide MSN with bandwidth =
on=20
demand. MSN will be able to provision and pay for bandwidth as it's needed.=
=20
More details will be provided later, he said.=20
Aquila will take a different approach. It will look for assets while waitin=
g=20
for liquidity in bandwidth trading. Prices for network properties are=20
collapsing, Aquila's Nelson said, so more and more assets are becoming=20
available to companies with money.=20
"Any assets that measure up well against the forward curve, we're going to=
=20
buy," he said. "You need to buy low and sell high."=20
Nelson said Aquila will look primarily at metro assets and at some longhaul=

USA: UPDATE 1-Waxman urges probe of White House aide Rove.

WASHINGTON, July 17 (Reuters) - A key congressional Democrat told the White=

Rejecting the White House's contention there was no conflicts of interest.=
=20
Rep. Henry Waxman of California argued that the law requires the Justice=20

Earlier this year, Rove had contacts with energy companies as the=20

"A consistent theme of federal conflict of interest laws is their emphasis =

White House spokesman Anne Womack replied in a statement, "We are confident=

Waxman said during the Clinton administration the White House counsel's=20

Last month, shortly after Waxman first inquired about Rove's dealings, Sena=

Majority Leader Tom Daschle, a South Dakota Democrat, said his chamber=20

ROVE'S MEETINGS=20
Waxman said he wanted to specifically know what transpired during Rove's=20
meetings in March and April with officials from Intel, General Electric and=
=20
Enron , an energy company. According to a Waxman aide, Rove sold more than=
=20
$250,000 in stock in the three companies in June.=20
Waxman wrote to Gonzales: "Unfortunately, your letter fails to respond to m=

"Instead your letter states your conclusion that 'Mr. Rove ... took care to=

California Democrat wrote.=20
Waxman said: "I have closely reviewed the law governing conflict of interes=

"If the news reports of Mr. Rove's conduct are accurate, Mr. Rove discussed=

USA: INTERVIEW-EnronOnline sees volume growth, CEO says.

Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, July 17 (Reuters) - As most players in a shrinking pool of online=
=20
energy trading platforms struggle to stay alive, leader EnronOnline has a=
=20
simple philosophy: If it ain't broke, don't fix it.=20
The Internet arm of the energy marketing and trading giant Enron Corp. ,=20
EnronOnline predicts it will increase its volume and says it can coexist wi=
th=20
the IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), the chief executive of Enron Networks=
=20
told Reuters on Tuesday.
The innovative company is always evaluating its business environment, ready=
=20
to remold itself according to market demands, but it is not pursuing merger=
s=20
or aquisitions for now, according to Greg Piper.=20
"I would never say never, but we're not proactively looking at aquiring an=
=20
ownership position in any other exchange platform," Piper said.=20
With an average of $3.5 billion in trades every day, EnronOnline enjoys the=
=20
highest volume of all energy electronic platforms. Most energy trading=20
platforms launched last year have failed to generate profits.=20
Its closest rival is ICE, which routinely exceeds $1 billion a day. But whi=
le=20
ICE is a many-to-many exchange that matches bids and offers, on EnronOnline=
=20
one can only trade with Enron.=20
"It's a tool that supercharges our market-making business," Piper said.=20
Enron is the No. 1 natural gas and electricity marketer in the United State=
s.=20
About 60 percent of its transactions are captured through the electronic=20
platform.=20
"As long as we show good prices to our customers, our volumes will continue=
=20
to grow," Piper said.=20
The company is looking to grow online volume in products such as metals,=20
steel, weather, petrochemicals and plastics.=20
"We're trying to remain the leader in energy and help our other markets get=
=20
more traction," Piper said. "There is a huge amount of growth that we haven=
't=20
even tapped into yet."=20
Piper said he is not worried about ICE's recent success. The Atlanta-based=
=20
exchange recently took over London's International Petroleum Exchange and=
=20
plans to transfer its open-outcry business online, significantly boosting i=
ts=20
trade volumes.=20
"Maybe six to 12 months from now, the story might be a lot different," Pipe=
r=20
said. "But right now, there is room for the both of us."=20
He added that Enron traders do not shy away from trading on ICE. Many of th=
e=20
energy giants that founded ICE and provide most of its liquidity are also=
=20
Enron's biggest clients.=20
"Enron will seek out a good deal on ICE when there is one," Piper said.=20
INNOVATION KEY TO SUCCESS=20
Recognized as one of the most innovative companies in the United States,=20
Enron is constantly evaluating its position in the market and thinking of=
=20
ways to become more successful.=20
"The right thing to do in November 1999 was to launch EnronOnline," Piper=
=20
said. "But we look at it every day and if it made sense to do something=20
different, you can bet that Enron would do it and we wouldn't be emotional=
=20
about it."=20
One of the company's advantages is the fact that its software is a flexible=
=20
application that allows EnronOnline to easily go in an out of different=20
markets and regions. It constantly adds new products to its trading arsenal=
.=20
But Piper said that EnronOnline has no plans to turn itself in a many-to-ma=
ny=20
exchange.=20
"We want to focus in providing our markets to others," he said. "In the nea=
r=20
term, we're not changing that."=20
The company is considering licensing the application itself, but would not=
=20
elaborate on who wants it and how much Enron would ask for it.=20
EnronOnline has been so successful that even its competitors take their hat=
s=20
off.=20
"I've been hearing for two years now that a one-to-many exchange wouldn't=

work, but Enron just keeps proving people wrong," said Frank Getman, chief=

"If you're willing to make tight two-way markets and be the best price in t=

Terms of reference in Dabhol power inquiry may be difficult to frame, Seema=
=20
Kamdar

The decision of the Democratic Front co-ordination committee to order a=20
judicial probe has cheered many an activist and some political parties. But=
=20
framing the terms of reference of the inquiry may turn out to be a tall=20
order, given the fact that the supreme court has already made its comments=
=20
clear on the subject of probing the validity of the Dabhol power project.=
=20

The special leave petition filed in the supreme court by the Centre of Indi=
an=20
Trade Unions and activist Abhaya Mehta had raised two questions dealing wit=
h=20
the validity of the project and the accountability of the state government.=
=20
Only the latter part survives, with the apex court having observed that the=
=20
issue of validity of the project =01&is not in the public interest now to=
=20
reopen=018. On July 2, 1997, the apex court held that the issue has been de=
alt=20
with on several occasions in earlier public interest litigations in lower=
=20
courts. Further, it said, that considering the stage =01&at which the proje=
ct=20
now is , it is not in the public interestto permit re-opening of that matte=
r=20
for re-examination of the validity of the same once again.=018

Coming as it does from the highest court of the land, this perception would=
=20
make it uncomfortable for the proposed judicial inquiry to cover the=20
worthiness of the project in its entirety. Analysts point out that the term=
s=20
of reference for a judicial inquiry should logically be consistent with the=
=20
perception of the supreme court. In any case, the inquiry may not seem as=
=20
much of a positive development as it appears, they warn. They point to the=
=20
delay in framing the terms of reference for the inquiry. The government has=
=20
decided to draft the terms of reference =01&within a month=018. The renegot=
iation=20
of the project too, entrusted to a committee headed by former Union home=20
secretary Madhav Godbole, is moving at a snail=01,s pace. =01& We hold one =
meeting=20
a month,=018 says a committee member. At this rate, it might take a long ti=
me=20
for the committee to come up with a viable rate chart. These facts make man=
y=20
wonder whether the second phase of the project will ever be commissioned. T=
he=20
1444 MW phase is the larger of the two parts of the project and is 80 per=
=20
cent complete, according to Enron officials.

Many feel that arbitration would be more effective and at least quicker. =
=01&=20
Most companies go in for arbitration in the event of disputes. Enron should=
=20
be no different. Th very fact that  there is no serious effort to put the=
=20
controversy to rest casts doubts on the political will of the government,=
=018=20
says a senior Mantralaya official. He sees the judicial probe as a=20
half-hearted attempt to keep the project at bay. =01& The inquiry could go =
on=20
for ever,=018 he says. Then, there is the question of whether its report wi=
ll be=20
accepted by the state government. Excluding cases dealing with land=20
acquisition and minor disputes, the Enron project, as a private power plant=
,=20
has gone through more than 25 cases which have questioned various aspects o=
f=20
the project, including the tariff, the power purchase agreement, technical=
=20
clearances, the guarantee and counter-guarantee provided by the state and=

central governments respectively. At the moment, there are two pending cour=

cases concerning the project, one in the Bombay high court and the other in=
=20
the supreme court.

Maharashtra strives to avoid embarassment in Dabhol deal , Sanjay Jog

The Maharashtra Government, which has decided to institute a judicial probe=
=20
into the Dabhol deal, is striving hard to avoid an embarrassment from its=

constituents in view of its affidavit before the Supreme Court way back in=

Government in its affidavit during the hearing on a petition by the CITU ha=

said that various studies carried out by the Maharashtra State Electricity=
=20
Board (MSEB) have established that even after absorbing the power generated=

from Dabhol Phase-II, the shortage in base load for certain periods and=20

to=20
the Central Electricity Authority that conditions laid down by CEA will be=

fulfilled and MSEB will be able to absorb power from Dabhol Phase-II.=20
According to the State Government, MSEB has therefore little or no reasons =

Government said that however, on the experience of Dabhol Phase-I, it has=
