How about talking Monday pm?

There were a ridiculous amount of handouts again on Thursday, some of which
directly related to next week's assignments.  I thought the quiz was
straight forward enough.

Mark - my mom and I were going to go to the Pottery Barn Kids in Corte
Madera on Saturday, so perhaps we could stop by your house to drop off
copies of the handouts on our way in or out.  Send me directions again to
your house if you would.

I'm not sure how we can get copies to you Jeff.  I could drop them off to
your place in SF if that works.  Let me know.

Thanks,

Jeff, Mark:

Wondering where you were yesterday. Hope you didn't
forget about the in-class quiz!

The next HW and writeup due next week seems like
a heavy one.
Do most of you have Monday off? I'll take a look at the
case/HW Sa/Su, and prefer a meeting / conf call anytime
Monday. Perhaps PM in the city if folks are working
that day? Sunday PM (after 7) works for me too.
