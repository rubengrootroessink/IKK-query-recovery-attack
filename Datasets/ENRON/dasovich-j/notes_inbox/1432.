1997 Robert Mondavi Winery Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon Reserve 
(Exceptional) - Epitomizes Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon, the grape that is 
the backbone of America's most important wine district. Even at Robert 
Mondavi, which has produced its share of impressive cabs, the 1997 reserve 
stands out. The 1997 vintage was the best of the 1990s in the Napa Valley, 
yielding rich, concentrated red wines. Robert Mondavi Reserve's showy aromas 
of spice, cassis, and cedar make a strong impression in the glass. On the 
palate, the wine is deeply layered with pure dark-berry fruit flavors, has 
firm, ripe tannins and an ultra-smooth finish with superb length. ($120)

1997 Robert Mondavi Winery Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon Reserve - (91) Very 
tight nose, with blackberry, coffee and cocoa notes, this is a big wine that 
shows great intensity and depth. Quite closed now, the dark profile keeps its 
cards close to the vest. One thing for sure: this definitely one for the 
cellar. The finish is lengthy, with brisk tannins as well as espresso and 
bitter-chocolate notes. Hold for eight to ten years; this wine should keep 
till 2020. ($120)

1997 Opus One Napa Valley Red Wine (100) -- Could the 1997 Opus One be that 
elusive wine that one never finds? In my continual pursuit for wine nirvana, 
I have traveled to Bordeaux and back with stops in Italy and Australia and 
for what? Besides losing my luggage, tracking through customs and using 
non-functional phone cards, I have been searching for that wine of 
perfection. Could this wine finally be the one? This just released Opus One 
may be the absolute finest young red wine I have ever tasted in a bottle 
(barrel samples don't count). Aristocratically structured the 1997 Opus One 
magnificently perfumes the air with aromas of ripe, succulent fruit, 
fragrant, sweet earth and delicate, white flowers. Persistent to the point of 
perfection, this wine does not allow its captive audience to escape its web 
of Cabernet ecstasy. Made with the five important varietals of Bordeaux (82% 
Cabernet Sauvignon, 8% Cabernet Franc, 5% Merlot, 4% Malbec, and 1% Petit 
Verdot), this spellbinding wine commands attention. This is my top wine of 
the year. (Best Served 2002-2018). ($130)
