We are using the PUC figures for load.  We do not have the load (by size) in 
the MOU, it is only in the CPUC figures.

 It is the PGE RG-QF estimate that is in question.    We have used the MOU 
net numbers (93mln x 58%), which are close to our internal figures and 
sources which Robert has.   It appears that the MOU may have used the proper 
RG-QF gen figures but used the wrong divisor in calculating the pie charts.   
We can only guess at this based on the other data points we have.  I have a 
call into Saybrook Capital.

Michael:  did we decide to use the PUC's load numbers?  I would worry about 
that (particularly since we use the MOU QF/IOU gen numbers).  I suggest that 
we use the MOU load numbers for the three utilities, since the PUC numbers 
seem real screwy e.g., they have PG&E's load being smaller than Edison.

Best,
Jeff
