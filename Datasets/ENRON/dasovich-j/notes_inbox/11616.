Enron Reportedly Looking to Sell India's Dabhol Power Plant

Associated Press 
HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. would like the Indian government or one of the lenders 
on a dispute-plagued power project to buy out the Houston-based energy 
company's majority stake, officials said.
Such a sale of its 65% stake is the best way to go as long as it provides 
Enron (ENE) a "complete recovery of capital costs and related expenditures," 
company spokesman John Ambler said in Saturday's editions of the Houston 
Chronicle. 
Enron has invested $875 million in the Dabhol power plant project. 
The plant stopped production in May after its sole customer, the Maharashtra 
State Electricity Board, told Enron it was canceling a 7-year-old power 
purchase agreement. 
Enron contends the board didn't have the right to cancel. The company also 
denies the board's allegations that Enron has not lived up to its contract. 
Jeff Dietert, an analyst with Simmons & Co. International in Houston, said he 
doesn't anticipate the matter will be resolved quickly. 
Enron's public statement of its willingness to sell sends a signal to 
companies that might be interested, said Mr. Dietert, who added that the 
energy giant would be well served by resolving the protracted dispute. 
"The stock is going to be much better off after the issue is settled," he 
said. 
Mr. Dietert said the sharp rhetoric associated with the conflict between 
Enron and Indian officials have cast a shadow over the company's stock. 
Enron chairman Kenneth Lay visited India earlier this month and was hopeful a 
solution could be worked out after meeting with the country's finance and 
energy ministers. 
Uncertainty has clouded the $3 billion project, India's largest ever foreign 
investment, after Indian politicians argued the state couldn't afford Enron's 
prices and called for renegotiating the purchase agreement.

INDIA: Enron says wants Indian govt to buy its Dabhol stake.

BOMBAY, July 28 (Reuters) - U.S. energy group Enron Corp said on Saturday it 
wants to sell its stake in the Dabhol Power Company either to the Indian 
federal government or to the project's lenders. 
"As the largest investor in the DPC, Enron believes that selling its interest 
either to the government of India or to the project's lenders is the best 
approach to resolve the protracted dispute," a spokesman for its Indian unit 
told Reuters.
This follows comments made by Enron chairman Kenneth Lay in Friday's issue of 
Financial Times that Enron is looking to exit from its Indian venture. 
The Dabhol Power Company (DPC), 65 percent owned by the Enron Corp, is 
currently locked in a bitter dispute with a local utility over a payments 
default. 
"We want out," said Enron's Chairman Kenneth Lay in an interview with the 
Financial Times. 
DPC which is India's biggest direct foreign investment, had signed a contract 
to supply power to a state-owned utility, the Maharashtra State Electricity 
Board (MSEB), from its gas-based plant on the state's west coast. 
But MSEB stopped buying power in May calling it expensive and defaulted on 
payments jeopardising the project's future. 
"We have made it pretty clear to the government leadership we are now at a 
point where we would like to be taken out and we think most of our partners 
do," Lay said in the Financial Times interview. 
Besides Enron, the other shareholders in DPC are U.S. group General Electric 
and Bechtel which own 10 percent each and MSEB with 15 percent. 
Earlier this month Lay had a meeting with India's Finance Minister Yashwant 
Sinha to try and resolve the issue but talks ended without any solution. 
"We have fought this once before, put it back together, fixed the contracts, 
but we don't want to do that again and have the same problems in a few 
years," Lay was quoted by the paper as saying. 
DPC's power plant is being built in two phases. The first phase of 740 MW is 
up and running and the second phase of 1,444 MW is 97 percent complete. 
Some analysts say India's attempts to resolve the Enron dispute is a test 
case of its ability to attract more foreign investment. 
Last week U.S. assistant secretary of state on South Asian affairs, Christina 
Rocca, said the problems surrounding India's investment climate could be 
summed up in a five-letter word, "Enron". 
"I have to emphasise that it will be difficult for international investors to 
view India favourably until it (Enron issue) is resolved and in a reasonable 
manner," she told a meeting in New Delhi.

MADELEINE BUNTING

Arundhati Roy burst on to the Indian national stage from nowhere in 1997. A 
drop-out architecture student and one-time aerobics instructor, she had 
turned her hand to writing a novel. It was The God Of Small Things, and it 
earned her one of India's biggest ever advances before going on to win the 
Booker Prize and sell six million copies. The rebellious outsider - southern 
and female - had trumped the coterie of men who dominate India's literary 
world, and the reward was an insatiable international fascination. She found 
herself cast in the role of Indian national mascot, adored and feted for her 
global success. 
Four years later, there have been no more novels, and the now 39-year-old 
darling of India's middle class has become a painful thorn in its side, 
writing a series of savage critiques of India's development - its nuclear 
tests, its huge dam-construction projects and its cringing obeisance to 
western corporate power. These are home truths that powerful interests in 
India do not want to hear, and Roy has made herself many enemies. Irritated 
by her criticisms and the publicity they invariably attract in the west, the 
Indian establishment has set about trying to cut this awkward rebel down to 
size. This week, Roy faces a contempt of court charge before the Indian 
Supreme Court - her first appearance in the drawn-out case was four months 
ago. Her alleged crime is to have attended a demonstration against the 
court's decision last autumn to give the go-ahead to the country's most 
controversial dam project, the Sardar Sarovar in the Narmada valley, central 
India. Roy is accused of inciting violence and attacking a court official. 
Ludicrous though many aspects of the case appear to be, the lawyers Roy 
consulted advised her to plead guilty and apologise. When she refused, none 
would risk his career to represent her. Undeterred, she wrote her own 
affidavit and defiantly had it published in a mass-circulation magazine on 
the day of her first court appearance, much to the fury of the court, which 
has threatened further proceedings. Roy risks a six-month jail sentence.
How did the writer of an intensely lyrical novel become a committed activist 
with an analytical prose worthy of a barrister? What induced her to swap her 
status as Delhi's most-favoured dinner party guest for night marches and 
sit-ins at the dam sites, and even, possibly, jail? Why did the whimsical 
chronicler of "small things" - the beetles and creeping, lush greenery of 
Kerala - turn to fighting big things such as nuclear bombs, dams, the Indian 
state and globalisation? 
Roy comes down four flights of stairs to open the door to her apartment 
block. Here, where she writes and spends most of her day, she has none of the 
small army of servants considered necessary by middle-class Delhi. Her flat 
is surrounded by the contradictions of Indian development, which she analyses 
in her essays: a comfortable suburb of New Delhi, where cows rummage in the 
rubbish piled up in the open gutters, and where a man has set up shop in the 
shade of a tree, ironing the neighbourhood's washing, probably earning in a 
day just enough to buy one cafe latte in the new, empty, air- conditioned 
coffee shop. 
We sit in a crepuscular gloom, the fierce Delhi summer requiring that all the 
blinds be drawn, and the air-conditioning is on in Roy's small apartment of 
strong primary colours, books, a big television and computer. She talks in a 
low, gentle voice. It's a sharp contrast to the vehemence and coruscating wit 
of her writing. "I like the fact that my rage goes into bigger things, not 
into small, petty things with people around me," she says. "I am surrounded 
by people I love, and what I crave is gentleness." Friends come and go, and 
the telephone rings frequently. 
We get off to a bad start, because Roy hates the "writer-activist" label with 
which she is saddled - it reminds her of "sofa-bed". She writes what she 
sees, she says, and she sees no great distinction between fiction and 
non-fiction; all she does is keep her "aching eyes open". She refers me to an 
address on writing that she gave earlier this year in the US: "In the midst 
of putative peace, a writer can, like I did, be unfortunate enough to stumble 
on a silent war. The trouble is that once you see it, you can't unsee it. And 
once you've seen it, keeping quiet, saying nothing, becomes as political an 
act as speaking out." 
She stumbled on a silent war in 1998, after a giddy year of international 
celebrity which, she admits, she enjoyed "immensely" (all those hotel towels, 
she enthuses in one essay), but she knew, in the end, that the "good manners 
and hygiene" would kill her. What anchored her as she spun around the globe 
was home, and she resisted the temptations of emigration. "I'm not the sort 
of person who can buy a life." She came to see fame much like a tin can 
trailing noisily behind her wherever she went: eventually, it would drop off 
and she would then write some "worstsellers" and eat mangoes in the 
moonlight. 
But the prospect of such leisure vanished as she returned home to look at her 
country with new eyes: India was jubilant at its first nuclear test, and Roy 
penned The End Of Imagination, a furious attack on this symbol of national 
pride. The title was misplaced, however, because what then captured her 
imagination, and has done ever since, was that the biggest mass non-violent 
movement since Indian independence - the campaign against the Narmada valley 
dams - was then on the brink of victory. She set aside the novels she had 
been planning to read and threw herself into the detail of technical subjects 
such as irrigation and drainage. Since then, her voracious curiosity has 
ranged from export credit guarantees to electricity distribution rates and 
resettlement programmes for those displaced by the dams. 
Roy has spent much time reflecting on the direction her life has taken. She 
describes, with a romanticism akin to Tolstoy's, how the marches she attends 
in the Narmada valley have given her a pride in her people and her land, and 
also a philosophy. The struggle has rooted her, intellectually and 
emotionally, after the upheaval of celebrity. It also helped assuage the 
guilt over her sudden wealth, which she once described as making her feel she 
had "perforated the huge pipeline that circulates the world's wealth . . . 
and it is spewing money at me, bruising me with its speed and strength. I 
began to feel as though every emotion, every little strand of feeling in The 
God Of Small Things, had been traded in for a silver coin." Her interest in 
the dam is less personal, she says. Like any writer, she wants to understand 
and tell stories, and dams sum up, like nothing else, the story of modern 
India: its greed, its wanton violence and its centralisation of power. 
Surprisingly, in all these reflections, Roy steadfastly omits any reference 
to the deep emotional attachment to the rivers of her Kerala childhood, which 
is so evident in the novel. In one vivid passage, she describes the 
humiliation of the river after a saltwater barrage has been built: "A thin 
ribbon of thick water that lapped wearily at the mud banks on either side, 
sequinned with the occasional silver slant of a dead fish. It was choked with 
a succulent weed, whose furred brown roots waved like thin tentacles under 
water . . . Once it had had the power to evoke fear. To change lives. But now 
its teeth were drawn, its spirit spent. It was just a slow, sludging green 
ribbon lawn that ferried fetid garbage to the sea." Almost every page of The 
God Of Small Things reverberates with the fragile vulnerability of the small 
- children, for starters, and an intense awareness of millions of tiny living 
things, and the preciousness of small quotidian events. This reflects a 
fierce protectiveness towards the small and the powerless that predates her 
literary fame; her student thesis, she says, was on the housing of the 
marginalised urban poor. Bombs and dams are the corollary of India's slums: 
the bombs have diverted the taxes, and the dams have deprived millions of 
their lands and their rivers. 
Despite the legal cases, and the veiled threats and savage attacks in the 
media, even by erstwhile allies, Roy is standing her ground. Her political 
writings have evolved from passionate polemic into something more dangerous: 
a considered and witty analysis of globalisation and its impact on India. She 
asks questions that are particularly awkward for the nationalist middle 
classes who are prospering on neoliberalism. Is globalisation "a process of 
barbaric dispossession which has few parallels in history? Is it a mutant 
variety of colonialism, remote-controlled and digitally-operated?" Roy has a 
wonderful sense of her own pace - she will not be hurried, or hurry herself - 
but she is slowly putting together what she calls a "politics of opposition". 
She already senses her place on the intellectual map of anti-globalisation; 
she's been reading Noam Chomsky, John Berger and tomes on the history of the 
third world; she is keen to meet the Mexican Zapatista hero, Subcommandante 
Marcos; and she wants to attend the next meeting of the World Trade 
Organisation. But she is aware that this is not just a matter of acquiring 
the right intellectual baggage. Her politics flow seamlessly from her public 
life into her private; her analysis of power is not just applied to Indian 
democracy, but also to how she relates to her family and friends, and how she 
deals with her celebrity and wealth. 
Roy's political essays, powerful though they are, have not so far achieved 
their objectives. The End Of Imagination in 1998 won her many admirers in the 
west, but in India it failed to dent the extraordinary consensus behind the 
nuclear bomb. The Greater Common Good in 1999, on India's preoccupation with 
dam-building in the 50 years since independence, pointed out that the dams 
had woefully failed to meet targets for either power generation or 
irrigation, while at the same time displacing at least 33 million people. Roy 
argued that the bulk of those displaced were untouchables or tribal peoples, 
and that this amounted to a form of genocide. The essay won her more admirers 
in the west and lent weight to the international campaigns against dams. 
The worldwide publicity that Roy has attracted by campaigning against the 
dams has succeeded in scaring off several western contractors of the huge 
Narmada project - it involves building 3,200 dams, including 30 major ones. 
But despite all her eloquence, and despite the mass protest movement, the 
Supreme Court ruled last October that work on the huge Sardar Sarovar dam 
could resume. It was a bitter setback to a movement that had believed it was 
on the brink of victory after a series of stunning successes, including the 
withdrawal from the project of the World Bank. The defeat means that now, as 
Roy faces her court hearing in Delhi, hundreds of miles away in Narmada the 
arrival of the monsoon season has set the waters rising again behind the dam. 
Over the next few weeks, police will have to drag people from their homes to 
prevent suicide protests by drowning: "While the judges are discussing our 
contempt of court case, people will stand chest-deep in water for days. 
Forget the Narmada, where hundreds of thousands of cases [of compensation for 
lost land] are pending in the courts; a three-judge bench will spend days 
discussing my case. But losing their dignity is much more important to the 
judges." 
The Sardar Sarovar dam alone will displace 400,000 people, and the state 
worst affected, Madya Pradesh, has officially declared that it has no land on 
which to resettle the people whose whole way of life for thousands of years 
has been bound up with the Narmada, one of the great rivers of India. What 
has embittered the battle is that most of the thousands of poor farmers and 
fishermen displaced in the past decade have yet to be resettled. In reality, 
many of those who lose their lands or livelihoods are likely to receive 
nothing more than paltry financial compensation. They end up either as cheap 
agricultural labour or swell the shanty towns. Both options are close to 
destitution. Meanwhile, promises that the dams will help irrigate dry regions 
of Gujarat ring hollow, not least because none of the necessary canals has 
been budgeted for. In reality, the dams will provide electricity and water 
for the prospering urban industrial interests of the state - which is why the 
Supreme Court judgment was greeted with jubilation in Gujarat's cities. 
The dam presents a stark conflict between the interests of urban and rural, 
between industrial and subsistence economies; and it crystallises Roy's own 
questions about progress - that the poorest are crushed in the pursuit of 
development. "I can imagine in the 50s what a fantastic feat of engineering a 
dam appeared to be, but now, when what we know about nature is little enough, 
how can you continue to think this is a wonderful thing to do? To intervene 
in such a massive way in such a complex process - it's like putting a 
jackboot into a spider's web. What kind of civilisation is it when you teach 
men in college to look at a river and imagine pouring concrete into it?" she 
demands. 
The one hope of forestalling the next big Narmada dam scheduled, the 
Maheshwar, is that it will fail to find the necessary financing within India, 
now that the project has become too controversial for any western contractor. 
Emboldened by this success, in her two most recent essays Roy has broadened 
the scope of her attacks to include the western corporations involved in the 
privatisation of Indian state electricity companies, in particular the US 
company Enron. Enron was accused of smoothing the path of its massive 
contract to build a power plant near Bombay with Dollars 20m to "educate" 
politicians and bureaucrats; now the electricity Enron produces is more 
expensive than any of its competitors', yet Maharastra state is locked into 
contractual payments of Dollars 220m a year. 
Such "business arrangements between these huge multinationals in the west and 
the third world elite", says Roy, promote a consensus that their model of 
globalisation - liberalisation and privatisation - represents progress: "It's 
a form of fundamentalism to believe that this is the only measure of progress 
- how much electricity is consumed, how much more rice is produced, whether 
it is eaten or goes to waste in warehouses. Even the tools the economists 
have developed to measure progress are flawed," she says, adding, "I think of 
globalisation like a light which shines brighter and brighter on a few people 
and the rest are in darkness, wiped out. They simply can't be seen. The 
lobotomy in the west is that you stop seeing something and then, slowly, it's 
not possible to see it. It never existed and there is no possibility of an 
alternative." 
But the alternative still exists in India, she believes - the country is too 
old and clever to be lobotomised into believing in the one single idea, "that 
life is profit". 
Defying the tyranny of this idea is a constant thread running through Roy's 
politics and her private life. It lies behind plans to set up with friends an 
Indian-based Corporate Watch to monitor corporate power. It informs how she 
is mapping out a politics that demands accountability, whatever the regime. 
"The only way to keep power on a tight leash is to oppose it, never to seek 
to own it or have it," she says. "Opposition is permanent." But these big 
political ideas also have deeply personal implications, she adds: "Personal 
politics and what you do from day to day is just as important as 
globalisation, and opposition to power has to be matched by a reluctance to 
use power in your own relationships. You oppose by the way you live as much 
as by what you say and do - and that is painful and joyful." 
Joy features prominently in her description of the politics of opposition - 
against all the odds, you defy your critics simply by having too much fun. 
That's why they couldn't forgive her and her mother when she was growing up 
in Kerala, she remembers - they simply weren't as unhappy as a single mother 
and her "thin, black, clever" daughter should have been. "The whole point of 
the feminist fight was that there has to be fun at the end of the tunnel. You 
don't want this image of beaten, oppressed, moaning women. You think about 
things, engage with the world, and you're aware of the terrible suffering 
that is happening around you, and the way to be with all of that is to enjoy 
the process of what you are doing and to speak joy in the saddest places. If 
you're living in a world that is telling you that only if you have 
hamburgers, buy diamonds and have a Rolls-Royce can you be happy, then you're 
saying in the happiest possible way that that is completely wrong." She adds, 
"It's a game of survival, and if you allow yourself to become unhappy, you 
will lose everything. I remember what my mother said to me: 'I've never known 
anyone who guards their happiness so fiercely.' I think it's important to 
patrol the borders of your happiness, to understand your sources of joy and 
to protect them, and to know that, so often, it's only when that happiness 
has gone that you know what it was. But you can be cooking or listening to 
music and think, I don't need anything else to happen or anyone else to be 
any other way in order to be happy." 
Happiness for her, she says, might be going to the market and choosing glass 
beads after weeks of late nights drafting an affidavit, or just lying on the 
floor all day with friends under a ceiling fan in the Delhi summer. Even 
gossiping with friends about relationships as the police move in to break up 
a demonstration at a dam site. These are what Roy describes as the "small 
delights" of her life, a source of the strength that has seen her through the 
turbulence of her meteoric rise to global fame and, now, the anxiety of the 
court cases. She describes her friends as "extraordinary people" for dealing 
with her sudden fame and money, and managing to maintain the "democratic 
nature of our friendships". None of them had money before, now she gives hers 
away, "and I know that it is as sophisticated an act to receive as to give 
it". She has probably made enough from the one novel to live on for the rest 
of her life; she eschewed more, refusing to sell the film rights, arguing 
democratically that six million readers had their own version of the film in 
their heads and she didn't want a single film-maker to replace them all. 
The fame has been burdensome, although she claims (somewhat implausibly, 
since she had her hair cut, a symbol of rare defiance in a culture that 
fetishises long hair) that she has some anonymity in India (when asked if she 
is Arundhati Roy, she says her standard reply is that she wishes she were). 
The causes in need of her celebrity are endless, and she turns down most of 
the requests that come in from all over the world: would she open a lung 
hospital in Kerala? Attend a conference on water in the Hague? Give a speech 
on being a writer at Amherst? Model for Cartier? Make a BBC television 
documentary? Roy smiles mischievously: "One woman phoned me and said, 'Oh, 
darling, that essay on the Narmada was absolutely wonderful. I wonder if you 
could do one for me on child abuse?' And I said, 'For or against?'" 
The most important thing, she says, is to keep in mind your own 
insignificance; she can't speak about every issue and do them all justice. 
She adds thoughtfully, "Sometimes it's hard, because fate has conspired to 
make my voice heard, so you have the illusion - or other people have - that 
you can do a lot." 
Roy is wary of the fickleness of fame, and likens it to a wind blowing 
through a house and all the shutters banging: "There were moments when I was 
so unhappy that I wished I hadn't written the book and I hadn't won the 
Booker." The "huge public fairytale" had "another, equal, opposite version in 
my private life - a terrible dark side". She refuses to expand, preferring to 
answer questions with general reflections on the nature of relationships 
between men and women - which perhaps supports rumours in Delhi that her 
marriage has broken down. In any case, the upheaval in her life has now been 
resolved. She lambasts the pact of mediocrity to which the vast majority of 
people subscribe in their marriages, and confesses herself bewildered as to 
why so many women have children. She has none herself by her marriage to a 
film-maker 10 years her senior, and has no plans to have any: "Until 
recently, I was never secure financially or sure enough about my life to 
think of having children. I'm so scared of the vulnerability of children. I 
suppose, in some deep way, I have not been able to cope with my own 
childhood. I wouldn't know how to protect the child's magic. Now, I want to 
live my life backwards, I want to be free to change my mind, to think my 
thoughts, and not to be responsible for moulding somebody and for teaching 
them what is right." 
Living backwards means that Roy is now looking forward to living out her 
teenage years and growing old, becoming a "fit, old witch"; a form of 
liberation that means being irresponsible, keeping everybody she loves 
feeling loved (that's not a matter of luck but hard work, she maintains) and 
depending on no one for anything - dependence is a form of selfishness, she 
insists. 
Roy admits there is a great struggle between political engagement - the 
demos, the preparations for the court cases - and her desire to concentrate 
on her writing. Her enthusiasm for the latter is undiminished: "I think 
writing is such a beautiful thing to play with all the time - having your 
hands in that stuff. I use it to live my life in the most public and the most 
private way, and I love all different kinds of writing: a novel, an 
affidavit, a letter. Writing leads me through my life, and I trust my writing 
so much more than anything else about myself." In the immediate aftermath of 
the Booker Prize, she said she would never write another novel - she objected 
to the way people treated her like "a factory". Now, she says, she will know 
instinctively when it is time to write and will be ruthless about applying 
herself to it. 
It is Roy's passion for writing that stiffened her resolve not to take the 
lawyers' advice and apologise to the Supreme Court, and she describes a 
poignantly revealing dream she had before the last hearing: "I had been 
sentenced to prison, but that was not the fear. The only way I could live out 
the sentence and be released was to learn not to form an opinion about 
anything. There was a sort of big playground with a dazzling dance 
performance, and I was unable to watch it because I was struggling not to 
have an opinion about it." 
She is more afraid of not being able to speak her mind than she is of prison, 
but she is also well aware that is a ghastly choice, one that she would much 
prefer not to be facing. For now, she feels a judge's hammer hangs over her 
every word. "It's never what it appears to be. It's much more a slow grinding 
down - of a writer in one way, of a lawyer or an activist in another. It's 
not about whether you go to jail, but how you have to adjust yourself to 
survive, and that's the issue - the fatigue, the complete fatigue in the 
end." This is the Indian state's version of the country's tradition of 
non-violence, she adds with wry resignation. 
But she also well knows that the same establishment can be vicious and 
violent. It is dark when we finish talking, and the apartment block is 
silent. She offers me a lift back to my guesthouse and as we leave, the back 
alley is deserted and Roy seems all of a sudden terrifyingly vulnerable. She 
is nonchalant, however. We get hopelessly lost in a suburb of New Delhi, 
going around in circles while she entertains me with anecdotes of being a 
judge at the Cannes film festival last year. I ask if she sees herself 
becoming a standard-bearer in the anti-globalisation movement? "Only if I can

India: Demand for DPC power only at 'particular' price

MUMBAI, July 27. THE Godbole panel today conveyed the power-offtake proposals 
of six States to Dabhol Power Company (DPC) officials. The company was told 
that there was combined demand for 800-1000 MW power at not more than Rs 2.50 
per unit. 
"One thing is abundantly clear. There is demand for (DPC) power at a 
particular price. If the price increases the demand may not be large" Dr 
Godbole told reporters.
" We have told Enron that the need for 800 to 1000 MW DPC power is not at 
baseload, nor is it an all-year-round demand. The States will require this 
power only between the months of April to November and the demand will fall 
during the rainy season," he said. 
Karnataka, Punjab, Delhi and Madhya Pradesh made representations to the panel 
yesterday. Rajasthan and Haryana have presented written proposals asking for 
300 and 100 MW each. 
While Madhya Pradesh has asked for power at Rs 1.65 per unit, other States 
have said they will not pay more than Rs 2.25 to Rs 2.40 per unit. 
According to Dr Godbole, the company officials will "take up the matter with 
lenders and collaborators" before the next meeting which is expected to be 
held in August. Meanwhile, according to DPC, the power purchase proposals 
presented by various States "are totally unrealistic and unattainable by new 
generation liquid fuel plants including even those in the public sector such 
as NTPC's Kayamkulam". 
Dr Godbole had suggested that DPC power "at competitive rates" could replace 
captive power in a number of States. He said though DPC had earlier agreed to 
reduce tariffs by 50 paise, this would no longer be easy as the project has 
seen cost escalation after stoppage of phase II work. 
"Our dialogue with Enron is bogged down by two issues- the plant load factor 
at which the unit is run and the price of power," Dr Godbole said. He said 
there was a need to take a "serious look at whether demand projections in the 
country are realistic".

Enron wants to sell its stake in DPC to fed govt or lenders

07/28/2001
Press Trust of India Limited
(c) 2001 PTI Ltd.

Mumbai, Jul 28 (PTI) US energy major Enron Saturday said it was ready to sell 
its entire stake in Dabhol Power Company's (DPC) USD three billion power 
project to "either the federal government or the project lenders". 
"This is the best approach to resolve the protracted dispute between DPC and 
Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB)," Enron India said in a statement 
here Saturday.
It said any sale would need to be on terms of providing complete recovery of 
capital costs and related expenditures. 
Friday, in an interview to the Financial Times, London, Enron chairman 
Kenneth Lay had said the multinational wanted to be out of India and he 
expected Indian government to buy the 2,184 MW project at Dabhol. 
"We have made it pretty clear to government leadership we are now at a point 
where we would like to be taken out and we think most of our partners do," he 
had said. 
Enron said as the largest investor in DPC, it believed that the issue was 
clearly "having an adverse effect on confidence of potential foreign 
investors to India and pursuing a buyout option can help resolve the dispute 
in a timely manner". 
In a clear reference to its estranged relationship and bitter battle with 
MSEB and state government over unpaid dues upto USD 45 million, Enron said 
failure to reform power sector in India, especially in western state of 
Maharashtra, makes it "extremely difficult" for an outside generator to 
operate effectively. 
"We have serious concerns that DPC not become embroiled in a perpetual series 
of renegotiations, given our experiences of having already renegotiated the 
contract in the 1990s," it said. 
In his interview, Lay had echoed a similar view, saying "We have fought this 
once before, put it back together, fixed the contracts, but we don't want to 
do that again and have the same problems in a few years," he said. 
Enron was involved in arbitration over the Dabhol power purchase contract in 
1995 with the earlier Shiv Sena-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in 
Maharashtra. 
Currently, Enron has a 65 per cent stake in DPC, MSEB has 15 and GE and 
Bechtel each has 10 per cent. 
The multinational also made it clear that till date it had received no 
"realisitic proposals" and there was no progress in creditworthy buyers, who 
could purchase power that was reasonable for new generation plants. 
Friday, Renegotiations Committee chairman Madhav Godbole had said Karnataka, 
Delhi, Punjab and Madhya Pradesh were ready to draw power from DPC's 1,444 MW 
phase-II at an average of Rs two to Rs 2.25 per unit. 
Meanwhile, the DPC's foreign lenders including Bank of America, ABN Amro 
Bank, Credit Suisse First Boston and Citibank also joined the US energy major 
in its special leave petition in the Supreme Court. 
However, DPC's Indian lenders led by Industrial Development Bank of India 
(IDBI) have not yet taken a decision over participating in DPC's petition 
with their foreign counterparts. 
DPC has approached the apex court challenging Mumbai High Court's order 
directing it to go back to Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commision 
(MERC) and also allow the multinational to activate the escrow account and a 
green signal for pursuing international arbitration. 
MSEB has stopped drawing power from DPC since May 28 and has also rescinded 
the PPA. Work for the project's phase II stopped after construction 
contractor GE and Bechtel terminated their contracts due to non-payment.

Enron wants out of India power plant / Company seeks buyer for its 65% stake

Enron Corp. said Friday the best way to resolve protracted disputes 
surrounding the Dabhol Power Co. is for the Indian government or one of the 
project's lenders to buy out Enron's stake. 
There has been continued speculation that the Houston-based energy company is 
looking to sell its 65 percent stake in the project, which has faced ongoing 
problems almost from the time of Enron's initial investment in the early 
1990s.
Enron spokesman John Ambler said Friday the company believes a sale is the 
best way to go but that any deal would need to provide the company a 
"complete recovery of capital costs and related expenditures." 
Enron has $875 million of equity investment in the project. 
In May, the Dabhol Power plant stopped production after its sole customer 
stopped ordering electricity. 
The Maharashtra State Electricity Board told Enron the week before it was 
canceling a 7-year-old power purchase agreement. But Enron said it didn't 
have that right. The board had also refused to pay for power, saying Enron 
wasn't living up to its contract, while Enron said it was. 
Days before the board gave notice to Enron, the company started proceedings 
to end the contract because of the unpaid power bills. But six months must 
pass before Enron can end it. 
Enron will also continue to pursue other remedies for solving the problems, 
Ambler said. Enron Chairman Ken Lay was in India a few weeks ago and met with 
government officials. 
Jeff Dietert, an analyst with Simmons & Co. International in Houston, doesn't 
anticipate the matter will be resolved quickly. 
He had anticipated Enron would try to sell its stake. 
"It's going to be difficult to come out any other way," he said. 
But by publicly stating its intentions, Enron puts out a signal to other 
companies that also might be interested in the stake, he said. 
Dietert wants to see Enron done with the situation. 
"The stock is going to be much better off after the issue is settled," he 
said. 
It's not so much because of the amount of money involved, he said, but 
because the rhetoric has created a big overhang on the stock.

Wind power scrutinized as state considers energy plans
By MELANIE S. WELTE
Associated Press Writer

Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

ALTA, Iowa (AP) - Rising out of a cornfield less than half a mile from Chuck 
Goodman's back door are three huge, whirling wind turbines, pumping 
electricity into the state's energy grid. 
Goodman leases the property to Enron Wind Corp., a California-based energy 
company, for its 292-foot-tall turbines. In all, the company has 247 sets of 
black, swooping blades churning out 193 megawatts of electricity - enough 
power for 72,000 homes. Twenty-one miles long, 7 1/2 miles wide, it is touted 
as the world's largest wind farm.
"It's something I believe in and I want to see it grow," Goodman, 73, says of 
wind power. "It's clean. It renews itself every day." 
Wind power has become a buzz word among energy companies, planners and 
environmentalists in Iowa as the state looks ahead to its energy needs. 
State regulators expect Iowa to exceed its current energy supply within two 
years. By 2003, Iowa's demand for electricity in the summer, when the need 
for air conditioning peaks, will outstrip generating capacity by 191 
megawatts, an Iowa Utilities Board report said. 
Legislators, spooked by rolling blackouts in California last spring, reacted 
with a bill that makes it easier to build new power plants in Iowa by 
removing some regulatory hurdles. 
Among the policymakers pressing for more consideration of wind power in 
Iowa's future plans is Sen. Charles Grassley. 
"Iowa may someday be considered the Saudi Arabia of wind energy," the Iowa 
Republican said. "Wind is obviously clean. It's abundant, even though it's 
not regular, but it's an abundant natural resource." 
A Web site by the American Wind Energy Association, a trade association 
representing wind power plant developers and others involved in the industry, 
lists Iowa as the 10th windiest state in the nation. 
But traditional utilities say that - because the wind does not blow all the 
time and because there is currently no technology to store it - it cannot be 
a large portion of the state's energy mix. 
"You certainly couldn't depend on wind for a large portion of your supply," 
said Dean Crist, senior vice president of MidAmerican Energy, the state's 
largest investor-owned utility. 
"When they're talking about Iowa being one of the windiest states, that's a 
year-round average," said John Ruff, spokesman for Alliant Energy, the 
state's second-largest utility. "The National Weather Service charts show 
that Iowa is good at three seasons out of the year as far as being windy. 
"In the summertime, when we need energy the most is when there tends to be 
not enough wind." 
Crist and Ruff say until technology allows storage of wind-generated power, 
it will be inherently unreliable. 
State Rep. Ed Fallon, a Democrat from Des Moines, said the utilities' real 
reason for hesitation is profit. Iowa utilities have fought wind power and 
other alternative energy sources for years, he said. 
"They can't control the wind like they can control energy generated by a coal 
plant or a nuclear plant," Fallon said. 
"The bottom line is that the energy companies don't want to lose control. The 
more we can move toward resources that don't subject themselves to control, 
the less influence they're going to have," he said. 
The American Wind Association says wind energy is cheaper to generate than 
coal-fired or natural gas power. 
Iowa currently gets 87 percent most of its power from coal, all of which 
comes from outside the state, the association said. In 1995, the latest year 
for which figures are available, the state's utilities spent $310 million on 
coal alone, not including the cost of the plants themselves, it said. 
By contrast, it costs about $750,000 to build a wind turbine, said Al Zeitz, 
site superintendent for Enron Wind's Storm Lake II wind farm. Wind farms near 
Clear Lake and Storm Lake also pay about $2,000 a year to each of 115 
landowners to rent the land on which each turbine sits - a total of $640,000 
per year, the Wind Energy Association said. 
Ruff said those figures don't include the backup generation necessary to 
provide electricity when the wind isn't blowing. That drives the cost of wind 
power up and makes it more expensive than either coal or natural gas, he 
said. 
Since June, utilities have announced plans for three new power plants in Iowa 
- one burning coal and two of them fired by natural gas. 
MidAmerican plans to build a 540-megawatt gas-fired plant just east of Des 
Moines and an 860-megawatt coal-fired plant with the location yet to be 
announced. 
A Louisiana company, Entergy Corp. of New Orleans, plans to build a 
600-megawatt gas-fired in Adair County in southwest Iowa. 
However, MidAmerican also is seeking proposals from wind farm developers to 
provide 100 megawatts of electricity. 
"We think there needs to be a balanced approach on energy ..." Crist said.

5 State Energy Advisors Fired Over Conflicts Ethics: The consultants were 
involved in buying electricity for California from a generator whose stock 
they owned, setting up a clash of official duties, personal interests.

The Davis administration, stung by charges of excessive secrecy, disclosed 
late Friday that it has fired five energy consultants because of conflicts of 
interest involving their official duties and personal finances. 
A sixth consultant hired to help California purchase electricity has quit, 
according to state records.
All were involved in purchasing electricity for the state from a generator 
whose stock they owned. 
In addition, the top lawyer for the agency buying the power was removed from 
her position because of concern about the way the issue of potential 
conflicts was handled. 
Top advisors to Gov. Gray Davis told The Times that they learned of the 
conflicts in the last week, after belatedly asking the consultants to file 
required economic disclosure statements. A review of those documents, which 
included stock holdings, showed that some of the consultants "may have 
crossed the line," said the governor's senior advisor, Nancy McFadden. 
State law prohibits officials from participating in decisions involving their 
personal financial interests. 
Although portraying himself as seriously concerned that such conflicts could 
undermine public confidence, the governor has not required some of his most 
influential private-sector advisors to file the kind of disclosure statements 
that led to the firings. 
Among them are two Wall Street veterans who have been most influential in 
promoting the governor's energy rescue plan, which includes the largest state 
bond sale in U.S. history. 
The New York firms that employ executives Joseph Fichera and Michael Hoffman 
have been paid $275,000 a month to, among other things, help pitch the 
$12.5-billion bond issue to Wall Street analysts and state lawmakers. The 
companies stand to make an additional $14 million if the state goes through 
with the purchase of utility transmission lines. 
Davis contends that Fichera, Hoffman and their associates fall into a 
separate category of advisor, beyond the reach of the state's political 
reform laws. Critics question the distinction. 
"The governor's approach may be convenient for him," said Jim Knox, executive 
director of the watchdog group California Common Cause, "but it ignores the 
law." 
Disclosure is crucial because the public needs to know that "decisions are 
not being made by people who have a conflict of interest," Knox said. "Trying 
to evade the law with a creative use of semantics is not what they ought to 
be doing." 
The firings disclosed Friday are unlikely to diminish criticism surrounding 
the more than 50 consultants and advisors hastily hired by the administration 
as it rushed into the power trading business this year. 
More than $25 million is being spent by the state on consultants, according 
to state records. 
In the process, seemingly little attention was paid to routine government 
ethics laws. 
It took six months for state officials to direct the consultants to file even 
basic disclosures of their personal finances, including investments. The 
state Political Reform Act normally requires such forms to be filed publicly 
within 30 days of starting work for state agencies. 
Even with the hastily ordered disclosures made public thus far, the 
circumstances of most of the stock transactions remain a mystery because key 
information was omitted. Most of the consultants, for example, failed to 
state when they bought the energy stocks. 
One of those pressing hardest for an investigation of possible conflict of 
interest violations and insider trading is Secretary of State Bill Jones, a 
Republican who hopes to challenge Davis next year. Jones has accused the 
governor of "a conscious policy of secrecy" in enforcing compliance with 
public disclosure laws. This week Jones called for a federal Securities and 
Exchange Commission probe of stock purchases by state energy consultants. 
4 Traders Owned Shares of Calpine 
The four traders removed this week all owned shares of Calpine Corp., a San 
Jose-based power generator that has landed the largest share of the $43 
billion in long-term state power contracts. Their investments ranged from 
several thousand dollars to more than $100,000, records show. 
While working for the state Department of Water Resources, officials said 
they bought undetermined amounts of Calpine power on the state's behalf. More 
than $14 million worth of electricity was purchased from the state by Calpine 
in the first quarter of this year, according to the most recent records 
available. 
"We did not want them making governmental decisions and holding these 
stocks," the governor's legal affairs secretary, Barry Goode, said in an 
interview. 
The highest-ranking consultant removed, Richard Ferreira, was hired on a 
$500,000 contract in January to assist in obtaining bids for long-term power 
and negotiating contracts, records show. 
A former assistant general manager with the Sacramento Municipal Utility 
District, Ferreira was paid $200 an hour by the state. After he disclosed 
owning as much as $10,000 in Calpine stock, officials discovered he had 
participated in a review of one of the company's contracts. Ferreira could 
not be reached for comment. 
The governor's office identified the other four as traders William F. Mead, 
Herman Leung, Constantine Louie and Peggy Cheng, most of whom could not be 
reached Friday by The Times. 
All of them formerly worked as energy schedulers at the Power Exchange, a 
now-defunct energy market similar to a stock exchange created in the early 
days of California's electricity deregulation. 
Hired by the state in February and March, the four signed temporary contracts 
calling for maximum payments of between $15,000 and $21,000 a month, 
including living expenses in Sacramento and flights home to Southern 
California. 
Mead, 55, a former Edison engineer, said state officials never warned him 
that owning energy stock was a problem until they demanded that he sell the 
stock a week ago. 
He said he bought nearly all of his shares 2 1/2 years ago for $12,000 and 
saw its value skyrocket as the stock split three times, doubling in value 
each time. 
Mead said he was called by the head of the state's energy buying team 
Thursday and fired. 
"I asked very directly, 'Is this because of the stock?' and they wouldn't 
give me an answer," Mead said. "[He] just said your services are terminated. 
"I came up here, away from home, living in a hotel room, trying to keep the 
lights on, trying to get the state through a crisis and now I get a finger 
pointed at me as if I'm some sort of criminal. I guess it's just politics and 
we're the pawns." 
Administration officials said they also are examining the actions of other 
traders, including one who bought Calpine stock just before beginning work 
for the state. That trader, Elaine Griffin, who also came from the Power 
Exchange, left the state power buying operation July 14, three days after 
disclosing her energy industry investment. Griffin, who the governor's office 
said had obtained another job, could not be reached for comment. 
Griffin reported purchasing $10,000 to $100,000 of Calpine stock on Feb. 1, 
in her final days working at the electricity exchange. 
A few days later, Calpine signed and announced a $4.6-billion, 10-year deal 
to sell power to the Department of Water Resources. 
On Feb. 20, Griffin joined the state power buying agency, just as the state 
and Calpine were finalizing an additional $8.3 billion in power contracts. 
One of those, a 20-year deal signed Feb. 27, was the longest. 
The state has awarded Calpine about $13 billion in contracts to supply power 
for up to 20 years. 
In addition to the state consultants who bought Calpine stock, two others 
reported owning stock in Texas-based power marketing giant Enron Corp. And 
two more bought stock in Southern California Edison, the faltering utility 
that Davis has committed himself to saving from bankruptcy. 
Another consultant bought stock in Reliant Energy of Houston, a large power 
plant operator that bought several California plants from utilities after 
deregulation. 
Bernard Barretto, an energy trader, who buys energy on the daily spot market, 
said in an interview that he bought about $2,000 in Enron stock shortly 
before he began work for the state Feb. 28. 
Purchase of Enron Stock Defended 
"I don't see a conflict," he said. "At the time, we weren't really dealing 
with Enron. I [still] haven't bought from Enron." 
Barretto said he never considered his Enron ownership a possible conflict 
until he received notice July 18 that he had to sell the stocks by noon or 
lose his job. 
That notice came from Goode, the governor's lawyer. 
"We expect and have always expected the state's consultants to uphold the 
highest ethical standards," he wrote. "That standard is not met by those who 
hold a financial interest in one or more energy companies while trading on 
behalf of the state on energy related matters." 
"Therefore each consultant who holds an interest in an energy company must 
divest himself or herself of that interest by noon today. If he or she 
refuses, the state will sever its contract with that person." 
However, the governor's office has taken a distinctly different stance with 
his closest financial advisors, Fichera and Hoffman. 
Davis aides cite an opinion sought last week from attorney Raquelle de la 
Rocha, a former member of the Los Angeles Ethics Commission and the state 
Fair Political Practices Commission. She concluded that the advisors do not 
have to file disclosure statements because they are contractors, not 
consultants, and will be working for less than a year on a limited range of 
projects. 
Fichera is Davis' point man on the governor's energy rescue plan--including 
the unprecedented bond sale. He has pitched the plan to lawmakers, reporters 
and the Wall Street financial community. Fichera refused to comment on the 
record. 
Fichera and Hoffman's companies, Saber Partners and Blackstone Group, 
prepared a controversial analysis that helped underpin legislative approval 
of the bond measure, intended to pay for past and future power buying. 
Pact Specifies Financial Advice 
The state's contract with the Fichera and Hoffman firms calls for them to 
provide "financial advisory services" to the state. 
The decision not to require public disclosure of their financial holdings 
stands in sharp contrast to the approach taken with Montague DeRose and 
Associates. That consulting firm was hired on a $1.8-million contract. Like 
the other two firms, it too was hired to provide "financial advisory 
services" to the state. 
That firm's top advisor, Douglas S. Montague, was required by the 
administration to fill out a disclosure statement. He reported no power 
company interests. 
The governor's legal advisors said the difference is that Montague is on a 
longer contract.

Chasing the powers that be Small energy projects generate excitement

BOSTON - Not so long ago, investing in the energy industry meant buying 
pieces of oil wells, hydroelectric dams and big, clunky utility companies. 
But power deregulation broadened the possibilities, and the headlines from 
the California power crisis have drawn entrepreneurs and investors into the 
sector.
While traditional energy companies are attracting most of the attention, 
there's growing interest in smaller companies in an emerging sector called 
"energy technology": software, microturbines, Web-based electricity trading 
and more. 
The companies and venture capitalists are after the "$300 billion jump ball" 
made possible by electricity deregulation, said Todd Klein, managing director 
of Kinetic Ventures, a Chevy Chase, Md.- based VC firm. 
Their monopolies gone, power companies are being forced to improve 
productivity. Start-ups are trying to help with a new generation of high-tech 
gadgets. 
Meanwhile, technology companies are demanding cheaper and more reliable power 
sources. Entrepreneurial talent is drifting to energy, and several 
technologies developed in government labs are now commercially viable. 
"We have been following these technologies 10 years, and they never were 
anything more than science experiments," said Jeff Miller of Boston's Beacon 
Group, which manages $1.6 billion in two energy venture-capital funds. "Now 
you've got the demand coming from the marketplace and very serious managers 
with very focused business plans." 
Offsetting the flurry of enthusiasm is tighter funding from venture 
capitalists. According to research firm Venture Economics, 77 companies took 
in more than $1.2 billion in funding in the sector last year, but so far this 
year just 17 companies have raised a total of $132 million. 
David Lincoln, founder of EnerTech Capital in Wayne, Pa., told entrepreneurs 
at a recent tech conference in Boston that nobody is in a hurry to make 
deals, and the conditions that venture-capital funds impose now "were 
virtually unheard of 18 months ago." 
The California power crisis has grabbed the attention of the entire 
investment community - every major investment bank is now tracking a sector. 
"Everybody's backing out of the dot-coms and telecoms," said Bradley Johnson, 
president of Washington-based Pepco Technologies. "They're saying the next 
new thing is energy, but they haven't figured it out yet." 
They are chasing some minor success stories like Chatsworth, Calif.-based 
Capstone Turbine, which makes free-standing microturbines that allow 
businesses to produce their own electricity. Company shares have traded as 
high as $100, but have fallen to under $20, and the company still hasn't 
turned a profit. 
The next little thing is on the minds of venture-capital funds as much as the 
next big one. That means they're interested in technologies that don't 
necessarily revolutionize how electricity is produced so much as help 
traditional companies produce it and customers use it more efficiently. 
"With the events which occurred in California and which are threatening to 
occur in other parts of the country, people are focused on immediate 
solutions to those problems," Klein said. 
These solutions include systems to help companies manage their electrical use 
and flywheels that store electricity on site to guarantee a steady stream of 
power to sensitive equipment. Other companies target the power companies 
themselves, with everything from software to satellite meter-readers. 
At the venture-capital level, backers tend to be looking for smaller 
investments and quicker returns. That's been an obstacle for some early-stage 
"green" companies. 
"Everybody's supply-side," lamented R.W. Cushing, an entrepreneur whose 
Austin, Texas, alternative-energy marketing company got the cold shoulder 
from venture-capital funds at the Boston tech conference. "Nobody thinks in 
demand terms." 
But in fact, alternative energy firms raised $2 billion last year from IPOs 
and VCs, according to research firm Clean Edge, based in Oakland, Calif. 
Renewable energy requires deep pockets and patience, and tends to be backed 
by big power companies that, if they can make alternative energy work, have 
the infrastructure in place to distribute it. 
Many big power companies are ensuring that they get the needed technology by 
backing start-ups themselves. Houston-based conglomerate Enron, for instance, 
has invested $90 million in 12 companies it sees as strategic partners. 
"I don't think there is a dearth of interest or investment in renewable 
technologies," Lincoln said. "(But) ... the reason why you see such a strong 
level of interest in helping the supply-side companies is, right now, that's 
where the capital is being spent."

LOS ANGELES -- Power crisis? The state's most powerful city does not have a 
power crisis. No whiff of summer brownout here. If every one of the 3,849,000 
citizens served by the infamous Los Angeles Department of Water and Power 
turned on every hair dryer they owned, the mood lights would not even 
flicker. You could wear a parka in our multiplexes. It's freezing in here.
Why? This is the best part. 
Socialism and coal, my friends, socialism and coal. The City of Los Angeles 
gets its electricity from a paternalistic monopoly run for the public good by 
bureaucratic lifers with engineering degrees who built belching coal-fired 
generating stations, nuclear power plants and gigantic hydroelectric dams -- 
and they built them (you have to respect the genius here) in other states. 
Imagine that. It is a most perverse turn of events. The rest of the country 
likes to wag its finger at California and tsk-tsk us for being flighty 
granola-heads who cannot grasp the brutal rules of supply and demand. That is 
the rest of the state. 
As California lurches ahead into August, spending billions of dollars for 
power from its dwindling state surpluses, praying for another month of 
unseasonably cool summer weather, Los Angeles thermostats are set on . . . 
whatever. 
Our Department of Water and Power did not join the stampede toward the flawed 
half-and-half deregulation. Five years ago, the DWP was assumed to be in need 
of supplemental oxygen. Aged, bloated, deeply in debt -- the department was 
seen as a dinosaur running on the fumes of an earlier age. The DWP did not 
deregulate for the simple reason that its managers and overseers did not 
believe it could compete in the go-go world of open energy markets. 
Silicon Valley is now begging L.A. for spare kilowatts to run its Web servers 
holding auctions for office furniture from failed dot-coms. 
Pacific Gas and Electric? Bankrupt. Southern California Edison? Teetering on 
the brink and waiting for a bailout from Sacramento. San Diego Gas and 
Electric? Defending itself against consumers outraged at some of the steepest 
rate hikes ever promulgated. 
The Department of Water and Power? Selling power at relatively low rates to 
happy customers who appreciate stability. 
To understand history's last laugh, one must comprehend how deeply the L.A. 
Department of Water and Power has been reviled in the past. 
The DWP is not simply another municipal utility its customers love to hate. 
It is not some Pepco occasionally pulling the plug on meter cheaters. 
No, the DWP is mythic. 
Question: How many public utilities have had starring roles as the bad guy in 
Oscar-winning movies? 
Answer: Remember Jack Nicholson in "Chinatown"? Remember what he was 
investigating, some nefarious plot to steal water from a faraway valley and 
bring it to a thirsty young city? The greed? The mendacity? The gall? 
That was the DWP. 
Critics of the DWP -- and those include the authors of two of the most 
popular histories of Los Angeles -- Marc Reisner's "Cadillac Desert: The 
American West and Its Disappearing Water" and Carey McWilliams's "California: 
The Great Exception" -- do not describe the early masters of the DWP as mere 
progenerators of some bad public policy. They describe them as evil. 
Really, the DWP could drive its enemies to almost Kaczynskian screeds -- they 
were called thieves, bullies, con artists and murderers. But not without 
reason. After the DWP's Saint Francis Dam burst in 1928, more than 400 people 
died. And of course, the DWP and by extension thirsty Angelenos almost 
drained one of the great inland waters, the fabled Mono Lake, to death. 
But there is no American metropolis where the power company is so intertwined 
with a city's destiny. 
On a plaque outside the DWP office in downtown L.A. (not far from the real 
Chinatown) is this inscription: "From pueblo to metropolis, the history of 
the city of Los Angeles is indelibly linked with development of community 
water and power supplies." Truer words . . . Inside the lobby of the DWP 
building, the first thing one sees is a larger-than-life cutout of William 
Mulholland, the squinty-eyed Belfast ditchdigger who became the father of 
modern Los Angeles, the self-schooled engineer who built the 238-mile 
aqueduct (on time and under budget, with mules) that brought water to this 
desert city. 
This is all you need to know about Mulholland: At the ceremony that marked 
the opening of the floodgates of the newly constructed aqueduct and the first 
rush of clean mountain water to Los Angeles, this was Mulholland's speech, in 
its entirety: "There it is. Take it." 
" 'Chinatown'? That really doesn't come up in conversation anymore," says 
Frank Salas, chief operating officer of the department, a 30-year man, a 
civil engineer. "It's more like, how do we get into your system? They applaud 
when you start talking about the DWP." 
Let the rest of California get its electricity from companies with Star Treky 
names like Enron, Sempra and Dynergy. The department's motto? "Water for 
Life. Power for Progress." 
Water and Power. 
Here it is. Take it. 
Of course, in recent years, the DWP has tried to put a more modern face on 
the department -- with programs such as "Green Power for a Green LA," which 
encourages solar panels and better light bulbs. 
All good and necessary. But let's review the numbers that are not advertised 
on the Web pages. 
While Mulholland often gets all the ink (good and bad), it was actually Ezra 
Frederick Scattergood who is the "father of municipal power" in Los Angeles. 
Ever heard of a little construction project called the Hoover Dam? Not only 
was Scattergood instrumental in getting Congress to spend the money to build 
the great dam, but he then got the federal government to lend the money to 
build the 266-mile high-voltage Boulder Transmission Line from the dam to . . 
. Los Angeles. 
Fact: Until 1942, hydroelectric power from the Hoover Dam supplied 75 percent 
of the electricity for Los Angeles. 
Fact: Angelenos consume less power per capita than any other residents of 
California. 
Fact: The DWP did transform itself. Its debt has been slashed from $4 billion 
to $1.2 billion today and falling. Its staff was whacked by 3,000 employees. 
And the department is selling its extra power to a desperate state. 
Today, the City of Angels is run on coal, which supplies half of L.A.'s 
power, from three jumbo generating stations in the desert in Utah, Nevada and 
Arizona. 
There is also nuclear power in Palo Verde, Ariz., and four local power plants 
that are run on natural gas. One of them, beside the Pacific Ocean, is named 
the Scattergood Generating Station. 
In the DWP lobby, there is an old photograph of Mr. Scattergood, wearing 
wire-rim spectacles, his hair plastered neatly to his skull, a natty 
mustache, a suit with vest and cuff links. 
Scattergood believed in cheap power and the glory of industry. Of course, the 
founding families took their cut. But Scattergood believed in an idea that 
almost seems quaint today: power for the public good. "After all," he once 
said, "what is there that is really worthwhile in life other than service in 
some form? Everyone has a calling and a bit of service to perform in moral 
and spiritual things and material things. Out of this alone can come 
contentment and true happiness." 
Ah, the spiritual things. Of course, there is also another photograph in a 
hagiography published by the DWP that shows the smiling Scattergood after he 
secured the $23 million to bring electricity here from Hoover Dam. Behind him 
is a banner. The banner reads: "Scattergood Brings Home the Bacon." 
So here in Los Angeles, as we throw another log on the fire and turn down the 
thermostat, that is as good a toast as any. 
Brrrr!

BAY AREA REPORT
SAN FRANCISCO / PG&E creditors won't be shielded in dealings

FINAL
A.12
(Copyright 2001)

A federal bankruptcy judge says he will not shield some of Pacific Gas and 
Electric Co.'s biggest creditors from potential conflict-of- interest charges 
for making energy deals while serving on PG&E's creditors' committee. 
Five of the committee's 11 members, including representatives from energy 
giants Enron and Dynergy, say they trade in the same market as PG&E and are 
engaged in related financial transactions. They also buy power or sell it to 
the utility. Such transactions could lead to conflict-of-interest suits and 
the rejection of a company's debt claim against PG&E if the company took 
advantage of inside information about PG&E available to committee members.
The members told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali that they would create 
an "ethical wall" in their companies to shield them from conflict charges. 
Such a wall would prohibit anyone with inside information from discussing it 
with employees responsible for financial transactions. Montali refused and 
pointed to the large sums at stake in dealings on the volatile energy market. 
"This can create enormous incentives to misuse confidential information to 
make large profits (or avoid large losses) and ethical walls can crumble 
under such pressure," the judge said Thursday. If the companies quit the 
creditors' committee, as they have suggested, many others without potential 
conflicts are available to step in, he said. 
The proposal by the creditors' committee was supported by PG&E and opposed by 
the Justice Department's bankruptcy trustee and the city of San Francisco.

Enron Wants India to Buy Dabhol, Still Eyeing Options (Update4)

Enron Wants India to Buy Dabhol, Still Eyeing Options (Update4)

     (Adds new Enron comment in sixth, eighth, 14th and 16th
paragraphs.)

     Houston, July 27 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the world's top
energy trader, wants the Indian government to buy out its 65
percent stake in the Dabhol Power Co. project, although it's still
looking at other options, a spokesman said.
     Enron has invested $875 million in the $3 billion project,
spokesman John Ambler said, adding any sale would have to insure
Enron would completely recover its capital and other costs.
     Enron and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, Dabhol's
sole customer, are in a seven-month dispute over $64 million in
unpaid bills.
     ``Enron does believe that selling its interest, either to the
government of India or to the project's lenders, is the best way
to resolve this protracted dispute,'' Ambler said.
     He added the company would continue to pursue all its options
under its power-purchase agreement with the board, including
international arbitration, and would try to protect the interests
of Dabhol's lenders, sponsors, fuel suppliers and LNG ship owners.
     The board, which is owned by the state of Maharashtra,
stopped buying Dabhol's power in May, saying it's too expensive.
The move came days after Dabhol announced it was beginning a six-
month notice period to end its contract with Maharashtra. Dabhol
halted production after the board stopped buying power.
     ``We're still pursuing other remedies in case the buyout
doesn't come through on acceptable terms,'' Ambler said. ``While
we remain open to discussing other solutions, we have serious
concerns about becoming embroiled in a perpetual series of
renegotiations.''

                             Partners

     The Financial Times reported earlier today that Enron is
interested in selling the stake, quoting Enron Chairman Ken Lay,
who was in India earlier this month. Lay told the newspaper that
partners General Electric Capital, a unit of General Electric Co.,
and closely held Bechtel Group might also want to exit the
project.
     GE Capital spokesman Ken Koprowski said the company ``would
give serious consideration to credible offers which would enable
us to realize our financial objectives for this investment.'' In
general terms, he said, GE has a ``long-term commitment to doing
business in India.''
     Bechtel ``would certainly consider an offer which would
enable us to obtain our financial objectives for this
investment,'' spokesman Alexander Winslow said.
     Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee was quoted in the
Business Standard last week, saying he wants to resolve the Dabhol
dispute before he visits the U.S. in September.
     ``The Dabhol issue is clearly having an adverse effect on the
potential of other foreign investors in India, and we believe that
pursuing a buyout option could help resolve the dispute in a
timely manner, protecting India's investment climate as well as
the interest of stakeholders in the Dabhol Power Company,'' Ambler
said.
     He added that India's ``failure to reform the power sector
has made it extremely difficult for outside generators to
operate.''
     Madhav Godbole, the chief negotiator on the Indian side of
the payment dispute, said earlier today eight Indian states would
be interested in buying power from Dabhol, but not at ``anywhere
close'' to the rates the utility charged under the Maharashtra
contract. Dabhol rejected the proposal as ``unrealistic.''
     Ambler said there has been ``no real progress'' in producing
creditworthy buyers in India that can purchase power at a price
that's ``reasonable'' for a new power plant.
     Shares of Houston-based Enron fell 74 cents to $46.10.
