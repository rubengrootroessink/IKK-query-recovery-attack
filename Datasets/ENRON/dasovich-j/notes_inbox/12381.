Despite the energy crunch, the state often finds itself with surplus power=

"If I start talking specifics," said Hart, "then I have to give out what I =

Hart said it took time to convince BC Hydro, which has demanded cash for so=

"We have only been able to do it for the last couple of months," said Hart.=

Ex-worker: Duke manipulated market=20



By Bill Ainsworth=20
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER=20
June 22, 2001=20
SACRAMENTO -- A former operator at Duke Energy's Chula Vista plant said he=
=20
was told frequently by company officials during the past year to alter the=
=20
plant's output in a way that may have boosted electricity prices.=20
The operator, Jimmy Olkjer, said he was even ordered to cut power generatio=
n=20
during energy emergencies, when the state faced rolling blackouts because o=
f=20
a scarce supply of electricity.=20
He said he believes reducing the electricity generation helped the company=
=20
charge higher prices. "It looks like that's what they were doing," Olkjer=
=20
said in an interview.=20
He and another former plant employee said that during the past year the=20
company regularly operated its least-efficient turbine, possibly to justify=
=20
higher prices.=20
The allegations, which they plan to repeat today at a state Senate hearing=
=20
investigating power generators, provide the first insider evidence that Duk=
e=20
Energy may have manipulated output at its South Bay plant to drive up price=
s.=20
Duke, based in North Carolina, leases the South Bay plant from the San Dieg=
o=20
Unified Port District.=20
A March report by the Independent System Operator, which manages California=
's=20
electricity grid, alleged that by withholding power Duke and four other=20
owners of generating plants have contributed to billions of dollars in=20
overcharges to California consumers.=20
Tom Williams, spokesman for Duke Energy North America, said that varying th=
e=20
output of the generating units at the Chula Vista plant had nothing to do=
=20
with trying to achieve higher prices.=20
He said the changes in output helped balance the state's grid by "dancing i=
n=20
the market" -- providing flexibility for grid managers by allowing the plan=
t=20
to add or reduce power quickly.=20
Williams added that the aging South Bay plant produced as many megawatts la=
st=20
year as it did in 1994.=20
Olkjer served as a plant operator for 18 years, mostly when the plant was=
=20
owned by San Diego Gas & Electric Co. After Duke took over the plant, worke=
rs=20
were guaranteed their jobs for two years. In April, when that period ended,=
=20
Duke laid off Olkjer and other workers. Now he is retired.=20
During the two years Duke has managed the plant, Olkjer said, operators=20
frequently got calls from officials with Duke Energy Trading and Marketing =
in=20
Salt Lake City telling them to adjust their production schedule.=20
Some employees at the plant monitored the hourly price of electricity poste=
d=20
by the Independent System Operator and recognized a correlation, he said.=
=20
"We noticed that a lot of times when the price was down (our) megawatts wou=
ld=20
go down," he said. "If the price was up, often the megawatts would go up."=
=20
Olkjer said he was never told why he was being ordered to turn the plant's=
=20
output up and down. When he asked, he said, company officials told him it w=
as=20
none of his business.=20
Still, he was puzzled, particularly when he was told to throttle down the=
=20
plant during electricity emergency alerts -- as he says he did Jan. 16 when=
=20
the state declared a Stage 3 alert, with the possibility of rolling=20
blackouts.=20
"It doesn't make sense to cycle up and down when there's a Stage 3 alert," =
he=20
said.=20
Duke spokesman Williams said the company may turn down units at the orders =
of=20
the ISO during a Stage 3 alert because the grid manager can find cheaper=20
power somewhere else.=20
Lisa Szot, spokeswoman at the ISO, said she couldn't determine whether the=
=20
ISO had ordered Duke to power down its Chula Vista plant Jan. 16.=20
Olkjer said the frequent adjustments of power production, which sometimes=
=20
occurred every half-hour, wear out the plant's equipment.=20
"It's harder on the machinery," he said. "It's like driving down the street=
=20
putting your (foot) on the gas and then slamming on the brake."=20
Before deregulation, Olkjer said, the four units at Chula Vista, which have=
=20
the capacity to produce 706 megawatts, had been operated steadily during mu=
ch=20
of their history.=20
S. David Freeman, formerly general manager of Los Angeles' Department of=20
Water and Power and now chief energy adviser to Gov. Gray Davis, said rapid=
=20
cycling had become more common under deregulation and is hard on equipment.=
=20
"We had almost 15,000 megawatts of generating capacity down for repair last=
=20
winter," said Freeman, referring to what industry experts agreed was an=20
extraordinary level of plant outages over several months.=20
SDG&E, which built the Chula Vista plant in the 1960s, sold it to the Port=
=20
District for $110 million. In 1998 the port leased the plant to Duke Energy=
=20
for 101/2 years in what critics are now calling a sweetheart deal.=20
The company pays minimal rent, but has made large profits. In the first=20
quarter of this year, Duke, which owns three other plants in California, sa=
id=20
profits rose 208 percent to $428 million from energy sales and trading.=20
Duke may hold the record for charging the highest price for electricity. It=
=20
asked $3,880 per megawatt-hour this year. By comparison, before the energy=
=20
crisis began, electricity sold for around $35 per megawatt-hour, an amount=
=20
which powers about 750 homes.=20
Federal regulators have ordered the company to refund $20 million to the=20
state for charging excessive prices unless the company can justify them.=20
In May, the company offered to pay the state to settle any price gouging=20
investigations, but Gov. Gray Davis declined.=20
Olkjer and Ed Edwards Jr., who worked at the plant for 20 years before bein=
g=20
laid off in April, said they couldn't understand why Duke ran the=20
inefficient, high-cost turbine unit during the past year while other=20
generators sat idle.=20
They said they believed it may have been an attempt to fetch a higher price=
=20
for electricity because the company got extra fees when it ran.=20
Williams, the Duke spokesman, said the opposite was true. He said Duke ran=
=20
the small turbine more frequently because it was less expensive. It ran on=
=20
jet fuel, which was cheaper than the natural gas powering the other units.=
=20
Edwards said the smaller unit was run so hard that it was destroyed.=20
"It ran so frequently and so hard, it needed extensive repairs," he said.=
=20

Estimates of Power Profits Disputed=20
Electricity: A study of overcharges by suppliers may be flawed, state=20
officials say. Davis quoted the figures to Congress.=20

By DOUG SMITH, ROBERT J. LOPEZ and RICH CONNELL, Times Staff Writers=20

?????Gov. Gray Davis' contention that California has been nicked for billio=
ns=20
of dollars in inflated electricity costs is based on a study that state=20
officials concede may have significant flaws, according to interviews and=
=20
confidential government documents.
?????Those costs--estimated by the state to be as high as $9 billion--were=
=20
central to Davis' testimony this week before a U.S. Senate committee, where=
=20
he again denounced power wholesalers and urged federal regulators to "give =
us=20
back the money that was wrongly taken from us."
?????The governor's impassioned demand, however, was based on shaky=20
calculations. The formulas are being reworked, said Charles Robinson, vice=
=20
president of California's grid operator, which prepared the study.
?????Robinson said he "had no idea" how much the amount allegedly overcharg=
ed=20
by the generators might change. For now, he said, the agency stands by the=
=20
numbers.
?????But internal documents from the California Independent System Operator=
=20
warn that some of the financial assumptions used to quantify the alleged=20
excess profits could be well off the mark.
?????What's more, the documents caution against relying on the agency's stu=
dy=20
as a basis for allegations of overcharging--as Davis did during his testimo=
ny=20
Wednesday. That warning was particularly important because the documents=20
provide for the first time a detailed accounting of how much each energy=20
supplier prospered from the state's power troubles between last summer and=
=20
February.
?????The largest amounts were charged by four out-of-state power companies,=
=20
according to the confidential Cal-ISO report. Okalhoma-based Williams Cos.=
=20
led the group with $860 million, followed by Duke Energy with $805 million,=
=20
Southern Company Energy Marketing (now Mirant) with $754 million and Relian=
t=20
Energy Services with $750 million.
?????When told of the alleged profiteering attributed to them, executives o=
f=20
the companies insisted the numbers were grossly overstated because of=20
Cal-ISO's poor methodology.
?????Duke spokesman Tom Williams said his company's entire energy earnings=
=20
for North America were less than the amount it was accused of reaping=20
unfairly in California.
?????"It doesn't add up. It doesn't come close to adding up," Williams said=
.=20
"What [Cal-ISO] has done is highly irresponsible math."
?????Paula Hall-Collins, a Williams Cos. spokeswoman, said the firm would=
=20
need to study the ISO report further. But generally, she said, such reports=
=20
fail to fully account for electricity production costs.
?????"We maintain that we have not overcharged, and that we have operated=
=20
legally."
?????Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley also questioned the figures, saying=
,=20
"There's a lot of misinformation out of there."
?????A Mirant spokesman said: "We haven 't overcharged. We haven't=20
manipulated. We haven't withheld."=20
?????Even some firms alleged to have overcharged to a much lesser degree we=
re=20
outraged.
?????Joe Ronan, vice president for government and regulatory relations at=
=20
Calpine, said the $236 million attributed to his company "doesn't bear any=
=20
relation to reality."
?????"Anybody can throw out any number," he said. "It's like McCarthyism. .=
 .=20
. Where is the evidence?"
?????A spokeswoman for Davis conceded that his refund figure was an estimat=
e=20
but defended it as reasonable.
?????"It's no surprise that the people that are gouging us want to dispute =
an=20
estimate of how much they're gouging us," senior advisor Nancy McFadden sai=
d.
?????Despite the cautions expressed in the Cal-ISO documents, officials=20
Thursday insisted they were not troubled that the governor referred to the=
=20
agency's figures as potential overcharges.=20
?????"The way it should be characterized is the amount paid above a=20
competitive benchmark," said Robinson, who is also Cal-ISO's general counse=
l.
?????The first version of the now-disputed Cal-ISO study was made public in=
=20
March. It estimated that power sellers earned $6.3 billion in excess profit=
s=20
between May 2000 and last February. The report, later revised upward to $6.=
7=20
billion, became a crucial element of the Davis Administration's campaign=20
against alleged electricity price gougers.
?????This week, just before Davis' appearance in Congress, the study was=20
updated again, adding another $2.2 billions in alleged excess profits throu=
gh=20
May.
?????The orginal study, which did not include actual pricing data, was most=
ly=20
intended to prod federal regulators into seeking information from generator=

that the state had been denied, Robinson said.
?????Thus far, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has ordered refunds=

by California utilities.
?????One encouraging signal for state officials came this week when FERC=20
reiterated an earlier order that Duke Energy pay millions in refunds. The=

order stemmed from the company's sale of electricity at $3,880 a megawatt=

Energy Company Abandons Plans for Baldwin Hills Plant=20
Power: Homeowners and environmentalists rejoice at decision. The site is=20
proposed as a 1,200-acre state park.=20

By JOE MOZINGO, Times Staff Writer=20

?????In a victory for environmentalists and nearby homeowners, an energy=20
company announced Thursday that it was abandoning its plan to build a power=
=20
plant on the site of a proposed state park in the Baldwin Hills.=20
?????La Jolla Energy Development Inc., in a letter to the state Energy=20
Commission, said it was withdrawing its application for fast-track approval=
=20
of the 53-megawatt plant and "will not pursue the Baldwin facility in the=
=20
future."
?????"We listened to the community," La Jolla President Steve Wilburn said =
in=20
an interview Thursday. "We need to find another place for this equipment."
?????The project was to be a joint venture between La Jolla and Stocker=20
Resources, an oil company that leases the land where the trailer-sized=20
natural-gas plant would sit.
?????Stocker officials said they will decide in the next few days whether=
=20
they will pursue the project. "At this point it's just La Jolla pulling out=
,"=20
Stocker spokesman Steve Rusch said.
?????But most observers said it would be difficult to move forward on the=
=20
fast-track schedule the state has implemented to relieve the energy crisis.
?????The state commission was scheduled to decide whether to approve the=20
project today in Sacramento, but the hearing has been canceled.
?????The news sparked elation among environmentalists and nearby homeowners=
=20
who had fought the proposal on grounds that it would pollute neighborhoods=
=20
and threaten an ambitious plan to piece together 1,200 acres of public open=
=20
space in the hills.
?????"We're getting ready to have the biggest party," said Tony Nicholas,=
=20
president of the hills' United Homeowners Assn. "This shows how a community=
=20
can come together for a common goal and mobilize the people in a matter of=
=20
days."
?????About 76% of the residents in the hills are African American and many=
=20
saw the issue as a matter of environmental justice.=20
?????In addition, Stocker and La Jolla were seeking approval for the plant=
=20
within 21 days of filing their application, under the governor's emergency=
=20
power orders. By following this fast-tracked procedure, they would have bee=
n=20
able to avoid the normal, time-consuming environmental review process.
?????That angered opponents even further, and nearly 1,000 people showed up=
=20
at a public hearing Monday to fight the project.
?????But what officials said turned the tide against the project--at a time=
=20
when the energy commission is approving such plants as fast as possible--wa=
s=20
testimony from a South Coast Air Quality Management official who said his=
=20
agency would not be able to approve the plant quickly.
?????Executive Director Barry Wallerstein said his agency would have to=20
conduct hearings that would take up to 60 days, pushing construction well=
=20
beyond a Sept. 30 deadline set by the governor for fast-track projects. He=
=20
also said it was unlikely Stocker could get needed exemptions from federal=
=20
clean air laws.
?????In a letter to the Energy Commission this week, Wallerstein wrote: "It=
=20
appears that the Baldwin Energy Facility could not begin operation until so=
me=20
time in the first part of 2002 at the earliest." By Wednesday night, the=20
energy commissioner who presided over the public hearings issued a statemen=
t=20
recommending that the rest of the commission deny the application for a=20
plant, citing Wallerstein's concerns.
?????Conservationists embraced the outcome as a sign that the movement to=
=20
create a park was gaining steam. The Baldwin Hills Conservancy was created=
=20
last year with the idea of creating green space for the densely populated=
=20
neighborhoods of south Los Angeles. With support from the governor and loca=
l=20
politicians, the state recently bought a 68-acre parcel in the area for an=
=20
unprecedented $41 million.
?????"This is a great day for the Baldwin Hills and all the people who have=
=20
worked so hard to bring this world-class vision to reality," said Esther=20
Feldman, president of Community Conservancy International and the main=20
organizer to build the park.
?????Also applauding La Jolla's decision were state Sen. Kevin Murray=20
(D-Culver City) and Assemblyman Herb Wesson (D-Culver City), who had come o=
ut=20
strongly against the project. They and others questioned whether the small=
=20
amount of power provided by the facility--coming online after the dog days =
of=20
summer--would do much to relieve the energy crisis.
?????"I'm ecstatic" Wesson said. "At this point the environment has won."
?????The plant would have sat on what is a working oil field about 650 feet=
=20
from the Kenneth Hahn State Recreation Area. And according to park=20
proponents, it would lie in the middle of the grander state conservancy, on=
=20
what would be a half-mile bridge of land arching over La Cienega Boulevard.
?????Rusch, the spokesman for Stocker, said much of the information=20
circulating about the trailer-sized plant is false.
?????The plan did not call for "a stack with billowing smoke," he said. "If=
=20
the issue is air quality, we've cleaned air quality up." In the last decade=
,=20
Rusch said, the company's existing 400 oil pumps on the property have reduc=
ed=20
nitrogen oxide emissions from 374 tons to 3 tons a year. The power=20
plant--with two 70-foot stacks--would ultimately add about 18 tons a year.
?????He said the company was trying to cut its energy bills by providing it=
s=20
own power to pump oil, while also contributing an extra 39 megawatts to the=
=20
state grid during the energy crisis.
?????Residents say there are more desolate places for the state to relieve=
=20
the energy problem. Said Mary Ann Green, president of the Blair Hills=20
Homeowners Assn.: "We just hope that Stocker would be responsive to the=20
outcry from the community."

As state legislators consider Gov. Gray Davis' deal to buy part of the powe=
r=20
grid in California, a public records advocacy group filed a lawsuit yesterd=
ay=20
demanding that the state release a report on potential health hazards of=20
living near high-voltage transmission lines.=20
The document could be vital to how legislators vote on the $2.76 billion de=
al=20
to buy Southern California Edison's power lines, said Terry Francke, genera=
l=20
counsel for the California First Amendment Coalition, which filed the lawsu=
it=20
in Alameda County Superior Court. The power line deal was brokered by the=
=20
governor to help the cash-strapped utility.=20
Legislators must approve the power grid purchase by Aug. 15 or the utility=
=20
can back out. Davis also has a $1 billion agreement to purchase San Diego G=
as=20
and Electric's power grid, which also would require the Legislature's=20
approval.=20
Pacific Gas and Electric has not agreed to sell its transmission lines.=20
The power lines report was completed in April by California Electric and=20
Magnetic Fields Program, an agency set up by the state Department of Health=
=20
Services to study the issue, Francke said. Both state agencies and their=20
directors are named in the lawsuit.=20
Efforts to keep the report secret are suspect, Francke said.=20
"If it's known there's some danger . . . do you want the state owning that=
=20
liability?" he asked.=20
The study began in 1993 after the state Public Utilities Commission committ=
ed=20
$7.2 million for research and education on the subject, Francke said.=20
The state document deals with scientific findings on how magnetic and=20
electric fields from transmission lines affect humans and possible policies=
=20
based on those findings, he said.=20
The report was scheduled to be released to the public on May 7, but "at the=
=20
last minute, the Public Utilities Commission apparently instructed the staf=
f=20
of the EMF Program to keep the reports secret," the lawsuit said.=20
State health services spokeswoman Lea Brooks said that the report was only =
a=20
draft and that her department was following orders from the PUC.=20
"The PUC wanted to see the draft before (it is released)," she said. "We=20
prepared (the report) for them. We are following their request."=20
Brooks refused comment on the lawsuit, saying her office hadn't seen it. PU=
C=20
officials were not available for comment.=20
Studies on the effects of magnetic fields have resulted in no clear consens=
us=20
on their effects, Francke said. That's what makes the state study important=
=20
for legislators to consider before voting on the governor's deal to buy=20
transmission lines, he said.=20
Opponents of the power grid deals say the report may add to objections to=
=20
Davis' agreements with the utilities. Some legislators would rather the sta=
te=20
help build more power generators in California.=20
"They are extra nails in the coffin," said James Fisfis, spokesman for stat=
e=20
Assembly minority leader Dave Cox, R-Fair Oaks. "We have fundamental issues=
=20
with the transmission lines, but when you start stacking these items up,=20
you have an undigestible deal."=20
Davis' spokesman Roger Salazar said he believed the governor hadn't seen th=
e=20
health hazard report.=20
"Obviously, if something pops up and is an issue, you'll take a look at it,=
=20
but I don't think we're at that point yet," he said.=20

Forgive Californians for savoring a bit of schadenfreude over the Houston=

=20
fattening up on the backs of the state's beleaguered utilities, residents a=

administration that Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman, was reported to have=20
interviewed a candidate for a job on the commission that regulates his=20
company?=20
Yup. That Enron.=20
On Monday, Enron shares hit a 52-week low of $43.07, after the Federal Ener=
gy=20
Regulatory Commission decided to apply the same price controls to power=20
marketers such as Enron that had applied to power-generating companies for=
=20
months. That's a far cry from August, when the company's shares peaked at=
=20
$90.=20
"There's a whole kaleidoscope of issues that Enron is being challenged with=
=20
in the marketplace right now, none of which on the surface is a major deal,=
"=20
said Donato J. Eassey, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Global Securities in=

Houston. "But when you combine them all . . . I think what's happening here=
=20
is you have a crescendo with this FERC announcement. You have people saying=
,=20
'OK, the growth rate is now in question.' "=20
That growth rate was an eye-popping 88.82 percent in revenues for the Unite=
d=20
States on a two-year average, and nearly 98 percent in the rest of the worl=
d.=20
Enron officials did not respond to a request for interviews, but as the sto=
ck=20
continued to drop Tuesday morning, chief executive Jeff Skilling issued a=
=20
statement to the markets in which he reiterated "strong confidence" in its=
=20
earnings guidance. The stock rebounded slightly throughout the week, closin=
g=20
at $44.05 yesterday.=20
In a speech at the Commonwealth Club last night, Skilling blamed regulatory=
=20
interference with the "free market" for investor flight from his company.=
=20
"Our stock prices have gotten hammered," he said. "They're half what they=
=20
were a year ago."=20
Tumbling stock prices weren't the only bad news for Skilling last night. A=
=20
protester pelted the executive with a berry pie just before he began=20
speaking. As Skilling used paper towels to wipe the pie from his face, a=20
woman was arrested on battery and malicious mischief charges.=20
Enron isn't the only company with stock prices that soared in tandem with=
=20
California's power crisis and are now suddenly headed south. Shares of=20
Reliant Energy Inc., AES Inc. and Williams Companies Inc., which generate a=
nd=20
sell electricity in California, and El Paso Energy Corp., which sells natur=
al=20
gas here, are all trading near 52-week lows.=20
The main culprit appears to be the suddenly serious talk in Washington abou=
t=20
power price controls, re-regulation and now, the possibility of big refunds=
=20
being ordered for California. Even Calpine Corp. of San Jose, which has=20
developed a reputation as an industry good guy because it has not played th=
e=20
spot market and has not been accused of manipulative tactics, dropped nearl=
y=20
7 percent yesterday, to $37.10. But none of the companies has been hit as=
=20
hard as Enron.=20
Such a drastic drop in market capitalization poses serious problems for any=
=20
company. It leaves it less money to invest in its own growth, and because=
=20
executive compensation is so closely tied to stock price, a sharp decline=
=20
makes it more difficult to retain talented leaders.=20
While Enron's power wholesaling division seems to be doing fine, the firm h=
as=20
been buffeted by disappointments in other lines of business and other regio=
ns=20
in recent months. In the financial press, the continuing knock on Enron is=
=20
that its business lines are so new and complex, and the company is so=20
secretive about its operations, that analysts and fund managers don't feel=
=20
confident in their understanding of what it does.=20
A look at the firm's recent troubles exemplifies its diversity.=20
For instance, Enron has engaged in repeated battles with the state governme=
nt=20
of Maharashtra in India over a 2,184-megawatt power plant there. The Dahbol=
=20
Power Co., which is 65 percent controlled by Enron, stopped construction on=
 a=20
second phase of the project on Sunday, claiming it is owed $48 million by t=
he=20
Maharashtra State Electricity Board. The state has accused Enron of chargin=
g=20
too much and not generating enough, and stopped buying power from the plant=
=20
last month.=20
Closer to home, Enron has struggled with its investments in fiber-optic=20
bandwidth. The company buys and sells unused, high-speed bandwidth space,=
=20
treating it like a commodity as it does electricity, coal or natural gas. B=
ut=20
the fiber-optic sector has imploded in recent weeks as it has become clear=
=20
that for all the long-distance cable laid in the ground, there have not bee=
n=20
enough "last mile" connections set up for users to actually take advantage =
of=20
it. Earlier this year, Enron scuttled plans for a joint venture with=20
Blockbuster to offer what it called "video on demand," in which customers a=
t=20
home would be able to select a video of their choice for a fee and have it=
=20
transmitted via fiber-optic cables.=20
Then there was the FERC ruling. For months, the agency had resisted=20
aggressive price controls in the West, preferring to let the market run its=
=20
course. But as control of the U.S. Senate was handed to Democrats this mont=
h=20
and President Bush appointed a tough Texan regulator named Patrick Wood III=
=20
to the commission, the agency changed its tune. It expanded price controls =
to=20
all hours of the day, spread the controls throughout the Western region and=
=20
brought previously excluded power marketers under the tent.=20
So under current calculations, that means Enron could sell power for no mor=
e=20
than $108 per megawatt in a shortage and about $90 during normal hours -- f=
ar=20
short of the hundreds of dollars that companies were regularly charging=20
during the past year.=20
In part, the company's gyrating stock price reflects the volatile nature of=
=20
the businesses Enron has decided to pursue. And the hard-charging company h=
as=20
a reputation for going aggressively into entirely new markets. But sometime=
s=20
that approach gets it in trouble, as was the case last year, when Enron had=
=20
to take a $400 million charge for its failed investment in Azurix, a global=
=20
water company that set out to make a commodity out of water supply the same=
=20
way it had done for electricity service, as governments privatized their=20
water systems. The opportunities never materialized.=20
Add it all together and Enron has a tough time supporting a price-earnings=
=20
ratio of nearly 39, considerably above the liberal standard of health, whic=
h=20
is 25. The company had less than $1 billion in profits on more than $100=20
billion in revenues last year. Still, a survey by Thomson Financial/First=
=20
Call found that analysts expect Enron to deliver earnings of 42 cents per=
=20
share in the second quarter (up from 34 cents last year), and $1.79 per sha=
re=20
on the year. Most maintain a strong "buy" rating on the stock.=20
But investors with big positions in Enron have taken a hit. Hardest-put of=
=20
them will be the Janus funds, which, as Enron's largest mutual fund investo=
r,=20
held nearly $3.33 billion of its stock as of the end of April.=20
In a semiannual report to investors, John Schreiber, a portfolio manager,=

said the stock price of the "new-age energy merchant" was a victim of=20
negative psychology resulting from the California energy crisis. Janus=20
declined to make fund managers available for interviews.=20

The three whistle-blowers outlined their accusations in interviews with the=

The company ordered workers to throw unopened boxes of bolts, steam seals,=

.=20
Duke officials acknowledge that new parts were discarded, but say the high=

inventory tax made it more efficient to order parts as needed because they=
=20
could be delivered within 24 hours.=20
Edwards and Johnson say they were ordered to dismantle critical equipment=
=20
necessary for the generating units to run at full capacity. Because parts=
=20
were thrown away, they couldn't make repairs and generators ran at diminish=
ed=20
capacity for days or weeks. Energy experts say this allegation, if true,=20
would allow Duke to withhold energy from the marketplace, which could drive=
=20
up the price. Duke officials counter that production has increased at its=

power plants and forced outages have decreased since they took over. But in=
=20
late 2000, there was a spike in outages at the Chula Vista plant, according=
=20
to records kept by the state's power-grid operator. The plant reported 3,00=
0=20
hours of outages from October through December. There were relatively few=
=20
outages before that.=20
The mechanics say the inability to perform repairs forced them to use a=20
small, expensive generator that was rarely powered up before Duke took over=

the plant. Experts say that could have been used to exploit federal rules=

allowing generators to justify prices based on the costliest units online.=

Stanford professor Frank Wolak, an expert in California's energy market, sa=

that if their testimony can be proven, the state could be refunded millions=

of dollars and future energy prices could be dramatically reduced.=20
"What they are saying is amazing. This is a classic plot. I've always=20

The Orange County Register=20
WASHINGTON - Gov. Gray Davis told anyone here who would listen Wednesday th=

overcharges from what he calls greedy power generators have now risen to $9=
=20
billion - $2 billion more than earlier reported.=20
And he wants that money back.=20
The governor said if the meetings federal regulators have ordered next week=

d=20

"They must be required to give us back our money,'' Davis told the Senate=

Government Affairs Committee during two hours of testimony and questioning.=
=20
It was the first time California's chief executive has testified on the=20
state's crisis. "It is unconscionable that FERC looked the other way while=
=20
energy companies bilked our state for up to $9 billion."=20
The $9 billion is the amount California's Independent System Operator says=
=20
generators overcharged utilities and the state from May 2000 to May of this=
=20
year. It had initially calculated that between May 2000 and February 2001=
=20
there were $6.7 billion in overcharges, Davis said. Those figures are a far=
=20
cry from the $124 million that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission say=
s=20
were overcharges. That's because FERC only looked at three months of rates=
=20
and only when the state was in an energy alert.=20
The governor faced tough, pointed questioning from Republican members and=

glowing praise and sympathy for his state's plight from Democratic=20

Everything from refunds to long-term contracts will be on the table at next=

If they can't, the administrative judge overseeing the talks will make a=20
recommendation to FERC, which can order the paybacks. Sen. Barbara Boxer=20

Not surprisingly, generators don't see the refund issue the governor's way.=

"It's just crazy," said Tom Williams, a spokesman at Duke Energy. "I don't=

And there's skepticism about next week's talks.=20
"The negotiations are going to be like the SALT Treaty," said Gary Ackerman=
,=20
president of the Western Power Trading Forum, which represents power=20
suppliers. "I question whether it can happen and work out."=20
Also at issue is money generators say they are owed by the utilities. Davis=
=20
said that's about $2.5 billion. But power companies say it's more like $5.5=
=20
billion to $6.5 billion.=20
Whatever the figure, Davis said, "we want to see their money in our pockets=
=20
before we talk about working anything out on their end."=20
The settlement conference was part of FERC's order instituting=20
around-the-clock price caps for California and its 10 Western neighbors.=20
Those price caps were made possible, experts agree, because California=20
lawmakers from both sides of the aisle riled up the public enough over the=

issue that the Bush administration felt the heat.=20
The question is whether that can work with refunds.=20

In rolling blackouts, 'together' is all relative=20
June 21, 2001=20
I have a confession to make: I'm an N001. And as an N001 I can't help feeli=
ng=20
a little guilty.=20
I feel guilty that I won't be called upon to share the pain of all those=20
A001s in=20
Irvine and Laguna Woods, or the M003s in Costa Mesa and Cypress. While the=
=20
M011s in Fountain=20
Valley suffer and sweat through rolling blackouts, I'll be sitting pretty.=
=20
Because I'm an N001. And the dirty little secret about rolling power=20
blackouts is how many of us are out there.=20
Allow me to explain.=20
As you may have heard, Southern California Edison has been required to set =
up=20
a public notification system for rolling blackouts. If you hear on the news=
=20
that the power guys are expecting rolling blackouts, you can go to a Web si=
te=20
(www.sce.com) or call a toll-free phone number (800-611-1911) to see if you=
r=20
"rotating outage group" is on the list for going temporarily dark.=20
How do you know which group you're in? On your Edison power bill, next to=
=20
your account number, there's a code that starts with A or M - A001, A002,=
=20
M001, M002 and so on. That's your outage group number.=20
But wait. There's another category of outage group. If your power bill has=
=20
the code number N001 on it, it means that you're exempt from rolling=20
blackouts.=20
You see, under Public Utilities Commission rules, electric power customers=
=20
who provide "essential public health, safety and security services" - such =
as=20
fire and police stations, hospitals, jails and so on - are automatically=20
exempt from rolling blackouts, even if they have emergency generators on=20
site. And because of the way electric power service is set up, anybody who'=
s=20
on the same circuit with an essential service provider is also exempt from=
=20
rolling blackouts.=20
For example, my house shares a circuit with a fire station. So I'm an exemp=
t=20
N001, as are the other power customers on the same circuit.=20
But here's the kicker: According to an Edison spokesman, 50 percent of all=
=20
Edison customers are N001s - that is, they share circuits with essential=20
service providers, and thus are currently exempt from rolling blackouts.=20
Let me repeat that: Half of all Edison customers are exempt from rolling=20
blackouts. (For San Diego Gas & Electric customers it's 40 percent.)=20
Mind you, this isn't something Edison likes to publicize. When I asked abou=
t=20
it for a column three months ago, Edison said it didn't know how many power=
=20
customers are automatically exempt. And when the company unveiled its=20
blackout warning plan this week, neither the Edison press release nor news=
=20
reports mentioned the 50 percent exemption figure.=20
True, even exempt power customers can be affected by rolling blackouts - at=
=20

Still, the next time you hear some power company or government official say=
,=20
"We're all in this together," don't believe it. When it comes to rolling=20
