PG&E sues state over seizure of long-term power contracts=20
By Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writer
(Published July 18, 2001)=20
Reopening an old wound in California's energy crisis, Pacific Gas and=20
Electric Co. has sued the state over a group of low-cost energy contracts=
=20
seized almost six months ago by Gov. Gray Davis.=20
The lawsuit, filed Monday in San Francisco Superior Court, stems from the=
=20
collapse of the California Power Exchange and the state's entry into the=20
power-buying business in January.=20
PG&E and Southern California Edison had entered into a series of long-term=
=20
purchase contracts through the exchange, a now-defunct market for buying an=
d=20
selling electricity. But as both utilities collapsed financially and the=20
Power Exchange was clinging to life, the exchange seized the contracts and=
=20
was about to auction them off for nonpayment of bills.=20
That's when Davis stepped in. Using his emergency powers, the governor=20
grabbed control of the contracts, saying he didn't want them resold at=20
inflated prices.=20
At the time, the exchange said the contracts were worth about $1 billion,=
=20
with PG&E's share set at $348 million.=20
But it's likely their value has fallen along with the spot market price of=
=20
electricity. Back when the governor seized them, PG&E's contracts were for=
=20
$60 to $130 a megawatt-hour. That was a bargain at the time, and made the=
=20
contracts very valuable. Now that spot prices have plunged, those contracts=
=20
are no longer such a great deal.=20
PG&E's lawsuit didn't put a value on the contracts. Nevertheless, "the stat=
e=20
has benefited from the contracts," said PG&E spokesman Ron Low. "We should =
be=20
compensated."=20
The state had planned to pay for the contracts, at a price to be determined=
=20
by a state government claims board, said Davis' spokesman Steve Maviglio. B=

he said the state also expected to be taken to court over the issue.=20
"We always thought we'd be fighting it out in a neutral forum," Maviglio=20

Hour of decision: Who will pay for costly power of past, future?


(Published July 18, 2001)=20

In the next few days, state lawmakers and regulators must make some=20
unsettling choices about how to share the financial burdens of California's=
=20
electricity debacle.=20
Looking backward, they will decide how -- or whether -- to erase $3.5 billi=
on=20
in debts run up last year by Southern California Edison, when it bought=20
pricey power but couldn't pass the costs on to consumers. Looking ahead, th=
ey=20
will choose who, if anybody, will get out of paying for expensive power=20
purchased by the state since the utilities ran out of cash last January.=20
In both cases, the principle guiding the decision ought to be the same: No=
=20
one is blameless in getting California into this mess, and no group can=20
escape the pain of getting out of it.=20
Democratic lawmakers in the Assembly are searching in vain for ways to hide=
=20
the real costs from voters. Their idea is to have the large users of power=
=20
(mostly big businesses) pay off Edison's past debts. In return, businesses=
=20
would get some freedom to shop for cheaper power deals in the future.=20
The problem is that there won't be much opportunity to shop in the coming=
=20
years. That's because Gov. Gray Davis went out at the very peak of the mark=
et=20
and bought up most of the state's future electricity supply before it went =
on=20
sale. The strategy of locking most of California's power demand into=20
long-term contracts seemed ill-advised at the time, even more so now.=20
Now that the governor has done all this shopping, the Public Utilities=20
Commission must assure that electric customers will pay for all that=20
electricity -- $43 billion worth of power over the next decade or so. In=20
addition, the PUC must commit customers to repaying the state for the power=
=20
it has already purchased this year -- many billions on top of that. The sta=
te=20
borrowed from itself to buy all this power, and is banking on a bond sale t=
o=20
pay off this debt. Unless a portion of the rate customers pay is dedicated =
to=20
repaying those bonds, they can't be sold.=20
This web of regulation, contracts and finance is so complex, so huge, it's=
=20
hard to see how the energy leaders in a few days will find a graceful, fair=
=20
solution. But for a political compromise to work, all the interests involve=
d=20
must take some pain.=20
Southern California Edison must swallow some of its debt. Power generators=
=20
and the state must renegotiate some of their long-term contracts so that th=
e=20
generators give back some of the bounty they reaped by market manipulation.=
=20
And no consumer, big or small, should be allowed to avoid paying the true=

costs of the power they use. In this reckoning, there's no easy way out for=

Utility sues state seeking millions in seized power contracts =20

San Francisco Superior Court.  The suit came as PG&E, which filed for=20

for the buying and selling of power, wanted the contracts for itself to=20
recoup hundreds of millions in unpaid power buys that PG&E owed it.  The=20
governor's office acknowledged that California owes PG&E for the contracts,=
=20
an amount that Davis wants a judge to determine. At the time they were=20
seized, the state estimated their value at $160 million, while the power=20
exchange priced them at $347 million.  "We seized the contracts to have=20
reasonable priced power and expected that price to be set in a neutral=20
forum," said Steve Maviglio, the governor's spokesman.  It's not easy to=20
determine their value. Using the contracts, the state buys electricity at a=

PG&E Sues State Over Contracts

July 18 2001

SAN FRANCISCO -- PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric Co. utility sued=20
California on Tuesday, saying it wants to be paid for the wholesale=20
electricity contracts the state seized in January.

Gov. Gray Davis took away Pacific Gas' 12-month forward contracts to ensure=
 a=20

=20
California estimated the contracts were worth $150 million.

Pacific Gas claims the contracts had "significant value" because they allow=

PG&E has demanded just compensation from the [state], PG&E has received no=

Contra Costa will spend as much as $1.7 million to conserve energy at the=
=20
county's nine worst "energy hog" buildings under a proposal approved=20
yesterday by the Board of Supervisors.=20
The measure is part of a larger effort the board in March agreed to underta=
ke=20
to reduce the county's energy use by up to 10 percent.=20
A private company will install upgraded heating, ventilation and air=20
conditioning control systems at the nine buildings, resulting in savings of=
=20
just under $200,000 a year.=20
"What we've done is pick our energy hogs," said Bart Gilbert, the county's=

County officials had no difficulty in identifying the hogs, which tended to=

Eight of the buildings are in Martinez, the county seat, and one is in=20

One energy waster is the 120,000-square-foot Summit Center, an office=20
building on Arnold Drive in Martinez that the county acquired last year.=20
The building's cooling system activates at a particular setting -- 76=20
degrees. So it shuts down completely when the temperature reaches below tha=
t=20
setting and won't turn on until it reaches about 79 degrees.=20
But new digital technology controls allow the system to gradually reduce or=
=20
increase power without having to shut down, which saves energy.=20
"When you turn the system on everything doesn't kick in, everything doesn't=
=20
come on full speed," said Gilbert. "That's a tremendous savings."=20
The county will contract with Syserco Inc. of Fremont to install the new=20
control systems from July through June 30, 2002.=20
County officials believe that the plan will reduce demand by 700,000 kilowa=
tt=20

The county has applied for a low-interest loan from the state's Energy=20

In the past two months, state officials have received $50 million worth of=

=20
Oaks (Los Angeles County), was debated for several hours yesterday, along=
=20
with a GOP-backed alternative by Assemblyman Roderick Wright, D-Los Angeles=
.=20
The two plans, which are scheduled for votes today in the Assembly Energy=
=20
Costs and Availability Committee, take sharply different approaches:=20
-- Hertzberg's plan would pay $2.4 billion for Edison's transmission lines =
to=20
help cover the utility's estimated $3.5 billion debt. The utility would be=
=20
allowed to pay off its remaining debt by issuing bonds.=20
The utility would repay the bonds using ratepayer money. For the first two=
=20
years, all customers would pay for the debt, but after that the largest use=
rs=20
would pay off the rest.=20
-- Wright calls his plan a "straight bailout." It would allow the utility t=
o=20
issue bonds to cover all of its debt and impose a $2 a month rate increase=
=20
for all users until the debt is paid.=20
The Senate also introduced its own plan. A bill by Sen. Byron Sher, D-Palo=
=20
Alto, would give the state a five-year option to buy the transmission lines=
=20
and would have the state back only $2.5 billion of the utility's debt.=20
Since Davis announced a deal with Edison earlier this year, lawmakers,=20
business groups and consumer advocates have all expressed reservations with=
=20
one aspect or another of it. Opposition has usually focused on the state=20
purchase of Edison's transmission lines.=20
The flurry of activity this week is an effort by lawmakers to take some kin=
d=20
of vote before they adjourn. The Edison agreement has an Aug. 15 deadline f=
or=20
approval by the Legislature.=20
Brian Bennett, a spokesman for Edison, said creditors view that date as=20
extremely important.=20
"We're as close to bankruptcy as our creditors want us to be," he said. "Is=
=20
it a drop dead date? I don't know, but it is clearly an important date."=20
Consumer groups have denounced Wright's plan, and at least one calls=20
Hertzberg's proposal just another bailout and said it would cost California=
ns=20
$6.7 billion over the next 10 years.=20
"We cannot be seduced by big businesses paying a bailout tax," said Doug=20
Heller, a consumer advocate with the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer=
=20
Rights. "At the end of the day, we know businesses will pass these costs on=
=20
to the consumer."=20
Included in the 76-page Hertzberg bill are provisions that would allow larg=
e=20
companies to buy their power directly from a provider instead of going=20
through the utility after 2003.=20
But a coalition of large business groups also said they are strongly oppose=
d=20
to the plan because it does not allow for immediate direct access.=20
"Ultimately, we think our companies buying power for themselves is the best=
=20
solution," said Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and=
=20
Technology Association. "If businesses think there's a light at the end of=
=20
the tunnel where they see lower rates coming, they might tough it out and=
=20
stay."=20
Wright argues that the beauty of his proposal is that it could easily apply=
=20
to the Pacific Gas and Electric Co. service area if the company wanted to u=
se=20
it as a way out of bankruptcy court. He estimates that PG&E customers would=
=20
pay about $4 a month to help the company pay off its debt.=20
"This is a straight bailout," Wright said. "This is not a hidden bill. Ther=
e=20
are extras."=20
Wright said he believes his constituents would rather pay an extra $2 than =
be=20
unemployed because their business left the state due to high energy costs.=
=20
Business groups said the idea makes sense.=20
"What good would it do to have your electricity bill reduced by $10 or $15=
=20
but not have a job?" said Bill Hauck, president of the California Business=
=20
Roundtable.=20
Whatever plan is eventually authorized would be used to convince the PG&E=
=20
bankruptcy judge to follow a similar model for that company, giving the sta=
te=20
those transmission lines as well.=20
The purchase of the transmission lines has been at the center of Davis' pla=
n.=20
He argues that the purchase will give the state the ability to upgrade the=
=20
system, allowing a better flow of power between Northern and Southern=20
California and a decreased chance of blackouts.=20
But opponents argue that the state is getting one-third of a complicated=20
system that will cost billions to upgrade and operate.=20
"It's like buying a car with three wheels -- it is not going to get out of=
=20
the lot," consumer advocate Heller said.=20

Gray Davis seized the energy contracts on Jan. 31 to keep the California ?P=

mount that Davis wants a judge to determine. At the time they ?were seized,=
 the state estimated their value at $160 million, while the power ?exchange=
 priced them at $347 million. ?"We seized the contracts to have reasonable =

 ?``We're seeing certain times of the day where we may not need power that =

' said ?Oscar Hidalgo, spokesman for the state Department of Water Resource=
s. ``We're ?probably moving a little more power than we anticipated, but I =
don't think ?anybody anticipated a July like we're experiencing.'' ?Utiliti=
es routinely sell surplus contract power when demand is lower than ?expecte=
d. But the state's recent sell-off could fuel criticism that ?California bo=
ught too much power at too high a price, fearing rolling ?blackouts and soa=
ring prices this summer. ?``There's a painful lesson to be learned when you=
 overbuy when supplies are ?tight,'' said Gary Ackerman, executive director=
 of the Western Power Trading ?Forum. ``Anybody can lose money in this busi=
ness, and the state of California ?is getting a taste of that.'' ?The state=
 in the past week has sold anywhere from 10 to 20 percent of its ?available=
 power, Hidalgo said. On Tuesday, the state had up to 40,000 ?megawatts ava=
ilable, while demand hovered around 32,000 megawatts, according ?to the pow=
er grid operator. ?Must be sold ?Because electricity cannot be stored, powe=

put ?it in a bottle and put it on a shelf.'' ?State officials would not say=
 how much they've made in sales to offset ?purchase costs, citing concerns =
about jeopardizing their bargaining position. ?According to California Ener=
gy Markets, a trade weekly, the state was ?unloading power last Thursday at=
 $25 per megawatt-hour. Ackerman said the ?state has been selling power for=
 as little as $1 to $5 per megawatt-hour. ?Power was selling on the spot ma=
rket for $20 to $40 per megawatt-hour ?Tuesday. ?The state, which assumed t=
he role of power buyer for California's biggest ?utilities in January, expe=
cted to sell surplus power from time to time, ?although not quite this much=
, Hidalgo said. Even with demand down, the state ?still is buying more powe=
r than it sells, he said. ?With temperatures throughout the West unseasonab=
ly low in recent weeks, other ?utilities also are selling their surplus pow=
er at a loss. ?``That's an accepted operating risk we always assume,'' said=
 Scott Simms, ?spokesman for Portland General Electric, adding that recent =
federal price ?caps are lower than what the Oregon utility paid. ``Sometime=
