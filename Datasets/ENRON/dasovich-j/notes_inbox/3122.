Internet Daily for Monday, May 21, 2001
by Frank Barnako CBS MarketWatch.com

Microsoft releases new MSN software

Microsoft officially released the latest upgrade to its free Web
browser on Monday. Similar in design to the home page of AOL Time
Warner's proprietary service, MSN Explorer seeks to keep users
tied to the company's Web properties. The colorful,
consumer-friendly interface of MSN Explorer includes links to
free e-mail, instant messaging, a built-in media player and
search services. Versions of the software will be available in 30
international markets by the end of the year, the company said.

Amazon to outsource book deliveries

Amazon.com is expected to ask privately held Ingram Book Co. to
mail books directly to customers. The step would be part of the
company's wide-ranging efforts to reduce costs. "You won't be
able to tell if a book is sent from our center in Fernley, Nev.,
or Ingram, in Laverne, Tenn.," Amazon Vice President Lyn Blake
told the New York Times. The company is also reportedly
considering hiring an outside firm to retrieve expensive
electronics items being returned by customers, to eliminate
confusion about whether all parts and manuals were shipped back.

NBC trivia contest links to Web pages

Participants in an NBC-TV contest next month will know it's time
to play when their computer opens a Web page. The promotion will
use technology from Digital Convergence Television, called CueTV.
The companies said "this allows a television to become a remote
control for a computer." It works by sending an audio tone to a
PC, which launches a Web page related to what is being watched.
The free CueTV kit, containing a cable and software, will be
distributed exclusively at more than 7,000 RadioShack stores
starting Thursday. The first use will be promoting NBCIQ, a
trivia game testing viewers' knowledge of NBC programs. Later
this summer, NBC said it will expand its use of the technology.
For example, while watching a news program, viewers' Web browsers
could launch pages with further information about a news
segment.

Youbet.com adds tracks in Gemstar deal

Youbet.com, which runs an online horse-race betting site, said it
will be able to offer bettors access to 20 major tracks,
including Churchill Downs, under terms of a partnership with
Gemstar-TV Guide . TV Guide operates a horse racing cable TV
channel. Under the deal, which could also lead to Gemstar buying
the Web company, TV Guide gets access to Youbet.com's technology
and a share in its revenue from wagering, while Youbet.com gets
content from TV Guide's tracks, in addition to those it already
has, The Wall Street Journal reported. "The biggest reason
subscribers canceled with us or did not sign up is that we have
not had the major track content," Youbet.com Chief Executive
Robert Fell told the Journal.

VeriSign will honor business trademarks

VeriSign Inc. said Monday it will respect a company's registered
or common law trademark rights when assigning Web addresses using
the new ".biz" extension. The first applications for
registrations for the new domain will be accepted in July, by
NeuLevel Inc. VeriSign said trademark holders will be able to
file claim forms for a fee of $89.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Deals of the day

Egghead.com Inc. announced that it sold the remainder of its
interest in Onsale Japan K.K., its Japan-based joint venture with
Softbank Corp., to Onsale Japan. As part of the deal, Softbank is
forgiving a long-term $2 million loan to Egghead. "We are pleased
with this transaction, as it further strengthens our balance
sheet by eliminating our long-term debt," said Mark Shepherd,
senior vice president and CFO of Egghead.com.

NewsStand Inc. announced it will handle digital distribution
services for Harvard Business School Publishing. Subscriptions
and single-copy sales of the Harvard Business Review will become
available next month, the companies said. Pricing has not yet
been announced. According to the Audit Bureau of Circulations,
sales of publications through NewsStand Inc. can be reported as
paid circulation.
