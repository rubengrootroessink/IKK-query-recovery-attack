NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- India's Power Minister Suresh Prabhu said Wednesday=

"You're all English-speaking. You are the opinion-makers of the country. Wh=
y=20
don't you spend some time understanding Indian realities?"=20
His words fell on the audience like the staccato of an AK-47 assault rifle.=
=20
They were dead on target some of Delhi's best-heeled businessmen, gathered=
=20
together at the Ashoka Hotel convention hall. S Gurumurthy, Sangh Parivar's=
=20
swadeshi ideologue, had been invited to deliver a lecture on a serious issu=
e=20
`Challenges and opportunities before the country'. But also sharing the dai=
s=20
with him, and speaking on the subject, were film stars Amrish Puri and Pooj=
a=20
Batra. It was clear that he was not too happy about this.
I was in the audience waiting for the conference to end. I had to take=20
Gurumurthy to lunch. His speech ended with muted but unmistakably snide=20
remarks from the audience. But, he also walked away with maximum applause. =
To=20
me, this illustrated the most striking element about his personality: you c=
an=20
love Gurumurthy or hate him; but you can't ignore him.=20
We walked to the neighbouring Samrat Hotel's Kamakshi restaurant, because=
=20
Gurumurthy likes simple south Indian vegetarian food. Straightaway, we=20
ordered rasam and papad as starters. Gurumurthy was still upset. "The=20
organisers should have prepared the audience for such serious topics as=20
this," he said.=20
As the bowls of rasam and the papad arrived, I prepared myself for a sessio=
n=20
with the man considered to be an influential link between the RSS and the=
=20
BJP. He wields tremendous clout, but avoids displaying it on his sleeve.=20
"Were you always in the RSS?" I asked. "No, I was closely associated with=
=20
Kamraj-ji's Congress till his death," he said, to my surprise. "Kamraj-ji=
=20
used to like me a lot, and our approach was to de-Dravidianise Tamil Nadu=
=20
politically," he revealed.=20
This figured! I know this is politically incorrect, but it must be said.=20
Gurumurthy is a Brahmin, and like most of his ilk, he was ideologically at=
=20
the receiving end of the virulent anti-Brahmin movement which swept Tamil=
=20
Nadu in the 1960s. That it has now waned, and even leaders of Dravidian=20
parties follow Brahminical rituals these days, says a lot about the=20
rethinking on the issue.=20
"Are you a practitioner of Brahminism?" I asked. This was a `Did you beat=
=20
your wife last night?' kind of question. I wanted to provoke Gurumurthy, wh=
o,=20
even his colleagues admit, symbolises traditional Brahminism. Gratifyingly,=
=20
he rose to the bait. "Call me Brahminist or retrograde, it doesn't bother m=
e.=20
If Dravidianism is good, then Brahminism is equally good," Gurumurthy said,=
 a=20
flash of belligerence flaring. He explained his political theory of=20
de-Dravidianisation of Tamil Nadu. "Dravidianism was political speculation=
=20
which became political reality. It (Dravidianism) was poison injected by th=
e=20
British," he said.=20
That Gurumurthy originally came from the Congress fold was news, but more=
=20
revelations were to follow. He was most appreciative of Indira Gandhi's=20
efforts to de-Dravidianise Tamil Nadu by forging an alliance with the DMK i=
n=20
the 1970s. "This was indeed a positive contribution of Indira Gandhi," he=
=20
said. Coming from a Sangh stalwart, this was significant.=20
After Kamraj's death, Gurumurthy found himself in the company of the=20
legendary and irrepressible media baron, Ram Nath Goenka. From here began h=
is=20
association with the RSS. "It was=20
a political assignment," he said,=20
recounting the past. This was=20
the time when Jayaprakash Narayan began his war against Indira Gandhi, and=
=20
Goenka's=20
The Indian Express played a crucial role in the campaign. "Obviously, in=20
those circumstances, my job was more than a financial adviser's," he said.=
=20
"But how did you get attracted to the RSS," I asked curiously. "It was the=
=20
sincerity of people in the RSS that attracted me. They are the gentlest=20
people I have ever come across. Had I not come into contact with the RSS, I=
=20
would have been a hundred times richer in terms of money, but I would have=
=20
been a thousand times poorer in other respects," said the chartered=20
accountant who virtually reveres his association with the Sangh Parivar.=20
"But you're influential because you are associated with the RSS," I said. A=
t=20
one or other time, many in the party and government have felt (and said) th=
at=20
Gurumurthy and his Swadeshi Jagran Manch hold a brief for only some Indian=
=20
industrialists and use their closeness to the RSS to camouflage this.=20
"Give me one example when I've used my influence in the government," he sai=
d=20
flatly. "You have suggested to the Prime Minister indirectly that he should=
=20
remove an officer from the PMO," I said. "Indirectly! No, you are mistaken.=
=20
This was a direct suggestion. Such officers are a blot on a great leader li=
ke=20
Atal Bihari Vajpayee, and I have never been circumspect on the issue," he=
=20
said, adding that had he been influential, his suggestions would have been=
=20
accepted. "My opinion may be powerful, but it does not mean I wield power,"=
=20
he explained.=20
Gurumurthy asked for curd-rice for the main course, a dish all south Indian=
=20
Brahmins swear by (it is also P V Narasimha Rao's favourite food). He=20
continued on the earlier theme. "It is unfortunate that in 50 years, the=20
system has produced very few Bhure Lals (an IAS officer who was one of V P=
=20
Singh's favourite officers)."=20
What did he think about the present government? "The problem is that an=20
Anglo-Saxon class continues to rule the country. Such people have serious=
=20
limitations in understanding Indian realities. They run the country like a=
=20
Bishop runs the Church. In the process, elite India has become the real=20
India," he said. Being a believer in cultural nationalism, Gurumurthy=20
hastened to add, "This divide is only perceptional. What links them is even=
ts=20
like the Kumbh. Culture and religion are the interface where elites and=20
subaltern meet. This is why secular parties are oblivious to real India," h=
e=20
said.=20
"You have been consistent in opposing the government's economic policies. W=
hy=20
is it that even Vajpayee, who belongs to the Sangh, is pursuing the same=20
course?" I asked. What I really wanted to know was his views on the=20
speculation about strained relation between the government and the Sangh=20

`NTPC should also absorb some part of DPC power'

Maharashtra finance and planning minister Jayant Rajaram Patil has said tha=
t=20
invocation of the government of India counter-guarantee by the Dabhol Power=
=20
Company has set the stage for the resolution of the Enron crisis. Talking t=
o=20
Business Standard, Patil spoke on the state government's future course of=
=20
action and several other issues.=20
Excerpts:
Please comment on DPC invoking the Centre's counter-guarantee.=20
The move is aimed at resolving the crisis. We have made it clear that the=
=20
high DPC tariffs have become unaffordable for the Maha-rashtra State=20
Electricity Board. Also, it is not financially prudent for the state=20
government to bail out MSEB in respect of the DPC payments every month. A=
=20
logical solution has to be found within the MSEB itself which has to be abl=
e=20
to absorb the DPC power. With the GOI counter-guarantee invoked, the state =
is=20
set for resolving the whole issue. The solution has to involve the central=
=20
government as it was the Centre that had invited the power major and=20
solicited others like Cogentrix to invest. Maharashtra, with a favourable=
=20
industrial climate, became the testing ground for the setting up of first=
=20
such power project.=20
What led to the present crisis and how is this being addressed to? Even the=
=20
setting up of review committee has been inordinately delayed?=20
Maharashtra economy cannot sustain payments to DPC's phase II, which too ha=
s=20
been sanctioned. I do not want to rake up the politics behind this. We have=
=20
to look forward to resolving the problem on hand.=20
As far as Maharashtra is concerned, the eight-party Democratic Front=20
government has unanimously decided that the present high DPC tariff is not=
=20
affordable and has to be rationalised. The Centre has to actively look into=
=20
it.=20
As far as the delay in the review committee's constitution is concerned, th=
e=20
task would be completed soon. We have shortlisted a number of experts and a=
re=20
seeking to constitute an independent body of experts to look at the multifo=
ld=20
aspect of the DPC project and suggest ways to resolve the present crisis. T=
he=20
panel would probably be asked to immediately submit a set of recommendation=
s=20
to resolve the issues at hand, while looking at the various other options=
=20
before it and suggest multifold recommendations to the government.=20
What options does the government have?=20
There are several lines of thought with regard to resolving the DPC issue.=
=20
The state government is clear that the DPC will have to make available=20
cheaper power. Another option could be staggering phase II. For instance,=
=20
block B and C of phase II could be staggered. We know that once the jetty f=
or=20
LNG is commissioned by DPC the tariffs would be reduced substantially.=20
Similarly, we would be keen to look into the possibility of restructuring t=
he=20
rupee-dollar arrangement so that the risk of foreign exchange fluctuations=
=20
are reduced. The panel would look into this aspect as well. MSEB has to be=
=20
able to afford DPC power. Along with cheaper tariffs, it might also be=20
necessary for the National Thermal Power Corporation to absorb some part of=
=20
the power generated by DPC. The Centre should take some component from Phas=
e=20
I and II. We have to resolve the present crisis as a nation and a state.=20
Why did DPC not invoke the Letter of Credit before the GOM and GOI=20
guarantees?=20
The Rs 135 crore LC was not invoked for obvious reasons. By invoking the GO=
M=20
and GOI guarantees, a dead-end has been reached as far as brokering pieceme=
al=20
solutions are concerned. Now the issue has to be resolve in totality.=20
We want to reach a new understanding with DPC on the project in which the=
=20
Centre will have to get into the picture. Union energy minister Suresh Prab=
hu=20
has been stating that the Maharashtra government should forward a proposal=
=20
for resolving the issue. We are in the process of doing just that.

THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY CRISIS Deregulation Didn't Foster Competition

The way people scrambled for a stake in California's power market three yea=
rs=20
ago, you'd have thought it was the second coming of the Gold Rush.=20
Politicians and free marketers boasted that they were freeing millions of=
=20
customers from their monopolistic utilities so they could shop for cheaper=
=20
electricity. The state ordered an $87-million publicity campaign, promising=
 a=20
brave new energy world bustling with competition.
But those dreams of capitalism unleashed never materialized, dashed by=20
provisions in the 1996 deregulation law that effectively undermined=20
competition and gave the utilities a substantial edge over newcomers. In th=
e=20
end, only 1.7% of the utilities' residential users switched to other=20
providers, many opting to pay more for "green" energy.=20
Although the chaos swirling around California's electricity crisis has=20
chiefly focused on soaring wholesale prices, the virtual absence of=20
competition at the consumer level has played a key role in deregulation's=
=20
undoing.=20
Had competition among retailers flourished, garnering the millions of=20
customers deregulators expected, prices might never have reached today's=20
unprecedented peaks and the turmoil might have been tempered, economists an=
d=20
retailers say.=20
Retail competition "would not have prevented a crisis, but it would have=20
toned it down," said Richard Counihan, spokesman for Green Mountain Energy,=
=20
which has returned most of its 50,000 customers to the utilities' ranks.=20
Now even the prospect of competition is gone. A measure enacted by the=20
Legislature last week, which made state government the biggest electricity=
=20
buyer in California, suspended further retail competition, preventing anyon=
e=20
from underbidding the state.=20
"That buries us," said Tony Wayne, president of UtiliSource of Brea, which,=
=20
under the new law, can keep its relatively small number of customers but is=
=20
barred from entering into new contracts.=20
Few thought it would come to this.=20
High Hopes Collide With Reality=20
Almost 300 firms registered with the state to sell electricity to consumers=
.=20
Many of them, quick-buck hucksters or small-time operations, were scared of=
f=20
by background checks, fingerprinting and the $25,000 deposit required to=20
enter the market.=20
But then there were the likes of giant Enron Corp., which predicted that th=
e=20
new market would pull 700,000 customers from the utilities in the first few=
=20
weeks. Another firm deployed 400 salespeople, nabbing residential and=20
business prospects by the thousands.=20
They quickly discovered that the structure of California's landmark=20
deregulation effort erected protective barriers preventing most retailers=
=20
from beating the prices of the big three utilities--Southern California=20
Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric and San Diego Gas & Electric.=20
For example, deregulation law allowed the utilities to keep their 9 million=
=20
customers until each took the initiative to switch. Any ratepayer who used =
a=20
moderate amount of energy and wanted to change companies had to pay $600 fo=
r=20
a new meter--unless the retailer wanted to eat the cost itself.=20
In contrast, Pennsylvania, where deregulation has been more successful than=
=20
in California, requires most of its utilities to surrender some of their=20
customers. Last year, 300,000 customers of one utility were auctioned off t=
o=20
the retailer who could promise them the most savings. All together, close t=
o=20
1 million customers have switched from utilities to retailers, with savings=
=20
estimates ranging from a few dollars to $15 per month.=20
In California, the next barrier was expressly designed by deregulation=20
architects to keep new retailers at bay, at least temporarily.=20
Before throwing utilities into a free-for-all, lawmakers felt obligated to=
=20
give them time to pay off debts that would hurt their ability to offer=20
competitive prices. The Legislature froze customer prices at 1996 levels,=
=20
well above what the utilities were then paying for electricity. The=20
difference would be used to pay their debts.=20
The hitch for prospective retailers was that their customers--like those=20
remaining with utilities--would be charged the extra amount too. That=20
seriously hurt the retailers' ability to shave prices for their customers=
=20
without taking a hit themselves.=20
Utility executives say the so-called competition transition charge=20
accomplished its intent: providing some protection against new players unti=
l=20
the utilities could shed their debt and compete on an even field.=20
According to those executives, the plan went awry when wholesale electricit=
y=20
prices soared before the special debt charge was lifted and competition had=
 a=20
chance to flourish.=20
"We haven't had enough time for this market to work," said Denise Grant,=20
director of the Edison division that works with retailers. She said Edison=
=20
expected to lose 150,000 customers annually--a far cry from what has=20
happened.=20
Retailers say they faced other obstacles that seemed designed to help the=
=20
utilities keep as many of their customers as possible.=20
One of the biggest was a newly created energy marketplace called the Power=
=20
Exchange.=20
Under the exchange's rules, all buyers--little guys with a few hundred=20
customers and mammoth utilities with millions--paid the same price for=20
electricity. Once again, retailers were stymied in their search for ways to=
=20
cut their customers' bills.=20
Retailers had no place else to shop for energy because suppliers could make=
=20
more money selling in high volume to billion-dollar utilities on the Power=
=20
Exchange, rather than cutting small deals with upstart companies.=20
Wayne, the president of UtiliSource, learned the hard way. He was peddling=
=20
electricity in California in early 1997, before the state created the Power=
=20
Exchange. After arranging a good, but informal, deal with a Washington=20
generator, he sent out hundreds of salespeople, took to the road himself an=
d=20
soon cornered 10,000 customers.=20
But the birth of the exchange caused the death of his deal, Wayne said. The=
=20
generators pulled out when they realized how much money they could make=20
selling on the open market.=20
"That was an oh-my-god. They said, 'Why should we give you a discount when =
we=20
can sell it to the Power Exchange ourselves?' " he said.=20
Retailers say the state protects the utilities in subtler but no less=20
damaging ways. That includes billing customers who switch companies for=20
certain overhead costs of their old utilities, such as weather forecasters=
=20
and accountants involved in procuring electricity.=20
In late 1999, a coalition of retailers filed a complaint with the Public=20
Utilities Commission arguing that their customers should not be forced to p=
ay=20
costs for utilities they had decided to leave.=20
Earlier this month, the PUC finally reached a decision that favors the=20
retailers' argument but accepts the utilities' calculations of the expenses=
=20
borne by retailers, an amount critics say is far too low.=20
In dissenting, Commissioner Richard A. Bilas called the decision's paltry=
=20
award to retailers another strike against them.=20
"We cannot keep stymieing retail competition if we are seeking rational=20
markets," he said. "Energy service providers [retailers] have left the stat=
e=20
in droves. . . . They need all the encouragement we can give them."=20
Retailers Found Little Opportunity=20
Be they multinational giants or kitchen-table entrepreneurs, retailers are=
=20
dismayed by their experiences with deregulation.=20
Enron spent $5 million trying to sell electricity in 1997 and the spring of=
=20
1998. But, unable to offer enticing discounts, the firm picked up only 30,0=
00=20
customers.=20
In a recent meeting with reporters and editors at The Times, Enron Chief=20
Executive Kenneth Lay suggested that the framers of deregulation kept marke=
t=20
forces pinned down in the retail sector. As a result, there was little mone=
y=20
to be made and little incentive to stick around.=20
"The more customers you signed up," Lay said, "the more [money] you lost."=
=20
Last week, Enron returned a number of its remaining electricity contracts t=
o=20
PG&E. "In the end," Lay said, "we couldn't change the rules and we pulled=
=20
out."=20
On the other end of the spectrum, Paul Oshideri is now a one-man operation=
=20
since he laid off his seven employees during his unprofitable two years=20
trying to entice customers to Cucamonga Energy.=20
"You don't have that many options," said Oshideri, who is still holding on =
to=20
his 250 customers and vows not to quit. "What can you do? You can't do=20
anything right now."=20
Only when it came to businesses and big institutions such as universities=
=20
were retailers able to make a dent in the market. The small price reduction=
s=20
they offered translated into huge savings for those large users of=20
electricity. The retailers also offered a variety of other services,=20
including aid to help businesses become more energy efficient.=20
Although fewer than 2% of all residential customers have switched to new=20
energy companies, 13% of industrial users have done so, according to the=20
Public Utilities Commission.=20
"If they'd structured this differently they would have had households able =
to=20
make big savings just like industrials," said Cal State Fullerton economist=
=20
Robert Michaels.=20
There is some dispute among deregulation critics over whether legislators=
=20
designed the law to protect the utilities from an onslaught of competition,=
=20
or it just turned out that way.=20
Jesse Knight, a former member of the Public Utilities Commission who=20
dissented on the panel's deregulation plan, said the law is biased against=
=20
retail competition.=20
"But I don't think it was the legislation's intent to protect the monopoly,=
"=20
Knight said.=20
There is general agreement, however, that not enough attention was paid to=
=20
the mechanics of the retail market.=20
Much of the deregulation legislation deals with generation, transmission an=
d=20
wholesale prices of electricity. The only provisions on the retail end simp=
ly=20
allow consumers to shop for deals.=20
Lay, the Enron executive, recalled that the utilities fought hard to mainta=
in=20
their customer base. The irony is that, with wholesale prices skyrocketing=
=20
over the last six months, buying electricity for all those customers has=20
driven the utilities to the brink of insolvency.=20
"With 20-20 hindsight, I expect they wish they'd agreed to more choice at t=

Texas Energy Company Thrives in California's Deregulated Atmosphere

Reporter (TM)=20

Though it produces hardly any power for California consumers, a Texas energ=
y=20
company is thriving in a deregulated energy marketplace that it helped shap=
e.=20
Through a combination of business and political savvy, the Houston-based=20
company, Enron Corp., has become a leading trader in the state's little kno=
wn=20
but increasingly important wholesale power market.
And while critics contend Enron's soaring fortunes suggest too much influen=
ce=20
over a badly flawed system, some analysts simply credit the company with=20
skillfully operating in a world that barely existed a decade ago, where=20
electricity is traded like soy beans or oil.=20
"The sellers have all the leverage and all the brains. And the buyers have=
=20
been slow and stupid," said John White, an environmental lobbyist who track=
s=20
energy issues. "What I wish is that the buyers' side of the California mark=
et=20
had people as smart and clever and aggressive as Enron."=20
Even as California overhauls its market, Enron will likely play a big part =
in=20
the state's energy future.=20
Partly as a result of state and federal policies that Enron has championed,=
=20
wholesale trading is now a crucial link in the process of delivering=20
electricity to homes and businesses nationwide. Those policies are unlikely=
=20
to change under President George W. Bush, who counts Enron chairman Ken Lay=
=20
as a friend, campaign contributor and energy adviser.=20
Enron reported record operating profits of $1.3 billion last year, excludin=
g=20
one-time adjustments. That's up 32 percent from 1999.=20
Most of its revenue came from wholesale operations. While Enron doesn't=20
provide financial results for each state, company CEO Jeff Skilling said th=
is=20
week that California accounted for about 7 percent of the company's $100=20
billion in sales.=20
"We've probably bought and sold more power than any other market-maker in t=
he=20
West," said Enron executive vice president Steven Kean.=20
Originally a gas pipeline firm, Enron now has many interests, from building=
=20
power plants in India to trading wood products and telecommunications=20
bandwidth on-line. It recently launched a venture with Blockbuster to deliv=
er=20
videos over a fiber optic network. But Enron's primary business involves=20
acting as a middleman between energy producers and the companies that deliv=
er=20
power to consumers.=20
At the company's 50-story Houston headquarters, Enron traders use=20
sophisticated software to monitor supply and demand, often based on such=20
variables as weather, plant breakdowns and availability of fuel.=20
Traders buy power from sources all over the region -- independent generator=
s,=20
local utilities, public agencies or other traders -- and assume the risk of=
=20
finding someone willing to pay a little more. Or they will contract to sell=
=20
electricity at a certain rate, betting on their ability to obtain that powe=
r=20
more cheaply.=20
"They'll take positions based on where they think prices are going to go,"=
=20
said Gary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum, which has 30 member=
=20
firms. "This is a guessing game. Enron does it better than most."=20
Enron's traders may buy from several sources to supply one customer. Or the=
y=20
might purchase a large volume and sell it off in slices, either on the spot=
=20
market or in long-term contracts.=20
"They understand financial markets and they understand risk management," sa=
id=20
Jim Angel, a finance professor at Georgetown University. "That gives them a=
=20
big competitive advantage over the old dinosaurs of the industry."=20
Enron pioneered such trading, he said, building on skills it developed in t=
he=20
natural gas business. But today, most power companies are involved in simil=
ar=20
deals.=20
"As a generator, my production cost might be 20 cents," Ackerman said. "If=
=20
someone else is offering the same commodity for 18 cents, just for this wee=
k,=20
I'll shut down my plant and buy their power and then turn around and resell=
=20
it."=20
Some critics suggest a market based on such price changes is too risky for =
a=20
commodity as essential as electricity. Attorneys have filed two consumer=20
lawsuits accusing generators and traders of manipulating supplies to drive =
up=20
prices.=20
But traders deny those allegations. Enron's Kean said they help find supply=
=20
to meet demand, while their long-term contracts protect buyers from price=
=20
spikes. Kean said Enron makes a profit buying and selling, no matter if=20
prices are high or low.=20
Those transactions are increasingly integral to the energy industry as it=
=20
tries to balance out surpluses and shortages around the region. Ackerman=20
estimated the volume of electricity sold back and forth on a given day is=
=20
often ten times the amount actually delivered to consumers.=20
Such trading will continue, he said, even though the state is now negotiati=
ng=20
long-term contracts with energy providers. "The traders will still try to=
=20
beat the costs of serving those contracts."=20
And traders may benefit from the demise of the state's Power Exchange. The=
=20
central spot market is closing because its largest customers, the utilities=
,=20
are insolvent.=20
Without the exchange to post an hourly rate, said James Bushnell of the=20
University of California Energy Institute, "there really isn't much in the=
=20
way of meaningful price information any more. And that does advantage=20
marketers. The cynical interpretation is that if buyers and sellers don't=
=20
have the information, the marketers can make money."=20
Enron was an outspoken opponent of the exchange when California first plann=
ed=20
for deregulation.=20
Over the last decade, Enron has joined forces with manufacturers and=20
industrial interests in a number of states, as they lobbied for permission =
to=20
bypass local utilities and negotiate for better deals with competing=20
suppliers.=20
In challenging the well-entrenched utilities, Enron has built its own=20
political clout. The company and its employees gave $2.3 million to federal=
=20
campaigns in the last election cycle, according to the non-partisan Center=
=20
for Responsive Politics. Enron donated $235,000 to California campaigns in=
=20
1998, including $75,000 to Gov. Gray Davis.=20
The company also has deployed its own army of lobbyists and consultants. A=
=20
few years ago, it hired former Christian Coalition leader Ralph Reed for=20
advice on building grass-roots support. In California, it recruited former=
=20
staffers from the Public Utilities Commission to help make its case.=20
During California's early discussions, state regulators embraced a=20
utility-backed plan for a single agency to run the state's transmission gri=
d=20
and operate a central exchange for wholesale energy transactions.=20
But Enron and its allies argued the agency would be dominated by the=20
utilities, which would discourage competition and make it harder to negotia=
te=20
lower prices.=20
In the end, California adopted a compromise: It created the Power Exchange =
--=20
mandatory for utilities and voluntary for others -- and a separate agency,=
=20
the Independent System Operator, to run the state's transmission grid.=20
Critics suggest the complex, decentralized structure has made it easier to=
=20
abuse the market, by withholding supplies or taking advantage of congestion=
=20
on the transmission grid to drive up prices.=20
But no one has produced evidence tying any company to wrongdoing. And Enron=
=20
denies taking any unfair advantage.=20
"The fact of the matter is it's easy to blame people from out of state," sa=
id=20
Kean. "It tends to deflect attention from some of the real causes of the=20
problem. The real underlying cause was that you had rapid demand growth and=
=20
you didn't have enough supply."=20
Enron has plans to increase California's supply. Though it currently has on=
ly=20
has a wind-power facility near Tehachapi, it's planning a 750 megawatt=20
gas-powered plant in Kern County and has three more up for licensing.=20
The company also has sought to build a retail business aimed at industrial=
=20
and commercial clients. It abandoned an earlier effort to sign up residenti=
al=20
customers in 1998, after concluding that California utilities had succeeded=
=20
in structuring deregulation to discourage competition for those customers.=
=20
But Enron has contracts with commercial clients to provide a range of=20
services, from advising on energy efficiency to supplying power at a=20
guaranteed rate.=20
As Skilling recently told industry analysts, Enron's business is "packaging=
=20
energy supplies for our customers."=20
It doesn't matter, he explained, if that energy comes from a plant that Enr=
on=20
owns, or from a contract with another supplier. "It's all part of one=20
business model."

California's Power Crisis May Slow Asia Deregulation (Update2)

     (Adds comment from government in paragraph seven that sale of
Korea Electric Power Corp. will go ahead on schedule.)

Sydney, Feb. 7 (Bloomberg) -- Asian officials are backing
away from deregulating their electricity industries after bungled
reforms in California caused power blackouts and pushed the
state's two biggest utilities to the brink of bankruptcy.
    =20
Companies and consumers will have a longer wait for cheaper
power as governments from Korea and Japan to Taiwan and Malaysia
delay plans to break up or deregulate monopoly electricity
companies.
    =20
Korea is reviewing plans to separate state-controlled Korea
Electric Power Corp.'s coal and gas-fired power plants into five
companies. The break up is scheduled for April.
    =20
``Stable supply is our first priority,'' Shin Kook Hwan,
Korea's commerce, industry and energy minister said last week.
``That's more important than leaving electricity supply in the
hands of market rules, especially in light of California's power
crisis.''
    =20
Malaysia's biggest utility, Tenaga Nasional Bhd., last month
asked the government to halt the opening of the power industry,
while Australian companies are complaining their country's system,
similar to that of California, needs an overhaul.
    =20
Asian governments are ``going to pause and take a deep breath
before they dive into the next phase of deregulation,'' said Rob
Booth, managing director of Bardak Group, an Australian energy
consultancy.
    =20
While Korea is looking at the implications of the California
power crisis, the government said this will not delay the sale of
its stake in Korea Electric Power Corp. starting 2002. The
government has 52.2 percent of Kepco, which will be sold off in
stages.

                            LA to KL

    =20
California's legislature last week voted to issue as much as
$10 billion in bonds to help rescue PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas &
Electric and Edison International's Southern California Edison,
which ran out of money as the price they paid for power rose eight-
fold in less than a year.
    =20
PG&E and Edison have run up more than $11.5 billion in debt
from buying power.
    =20
Price-cutting was the goal in California, but it all went
wrong. PG&E and Edison piled up debt because California's 1996
electricity deregulation law set no limits on the price they pay
for power, but capped the rates they can bill consumers.
    =20
Producers and distributors of power were supposed to match
their needs through a central ``pool'' where the price was set
depending on supply and demand. As demand rose and environmental
restrictions discouraged building of new power stations, supplies
tightened and generators pushed the price above the rate the
utilities could charge customers.
    =20
Power outages in California show the power pooling system
hasn't benefited customers, said Fuad Jaafar, chief executive of
Tenaga, which is two-thirds government owned and the biggest
Southeast Asian power utility by sales.

                         Power Down

    =20
It's in Australia, though, that the biggest parallels to
California are being drawn.
    =20
Australia is the only country in Asia which has split up and
deregulated its power industry, and is one of only four places in
the world which chose to use the ``pool'' price-setting mechanism,
invented in the U.K., which has failed in California.
    =20
``Australia is the last place in the world still trying to
get one of these U.K.-style markets to work,'' said Booth.
    =20
All the others -- California, the U.K., and Alberta province
in Canada -- are abandoning the system because it gives
electricity generators too much power to manipulate prices to
boost their profits, said Booth.
    =20
Bob Lim, an adviser to the Energy Markets Reform Forum, said
its members, large industrial power users in southeastern
Australia, don't want to be named because they're negotiating
power supply agreements, and finding it difficult to agree
``reasonable'' prices.
    =20
``That's an early symptom of what's happening,'' said Lim.

``There is a lot of nervousness about the market because of the
fundamentally flawed trading system.''
    =20
While there is concern about pool trading, analysts say
Australia's system is more resilient because unlike in California,
energy retailers have been able to use forward purchases and other
agreements to fix prices for much of their future power needs.
    =20
Meantime, a number of companies are benefiting from higher
power prices.
    =20
Origin Energy Ltd., a gas retailer and distributor, is the
best pick among Australian-listed companies which own generating
plants, said J.B. Were utilities analyst Gavin Rogers in a report.
    =20
``It owns peak power generation plants, has no current
exposure to electricity retailing and controls near-to-market gas
reserves, hedging it from any future input cost increases,''
Rogers said.
    =20
Most Australian generating plants are either state-owned, or
controlled by overseas companies.
    =20
Edison International owns Loy Yang B power station in
Victoria state, while NRG Energy Inc. of the U.S. has a one-
quarter stake in the adjacent A$4.7 billion Loy Yang A station.
    =20
Other foreign investors include AES Corp. of the U.S., U.K.-
based International Power Plc and Powergen Plc, and CLP Holdings
Ltd. of Hong Kong.

                         Elsewhere

    =20
In Japan, deregulation poses a different problem. Increased
competition could leave generators with too much capacity,
discouraging the construction of new, cleaner and more efficient
power stations.
    =20
Japanese electricity producers such as Tokyo Electric Power
Co., the largest, will face a tougher market, said Yoshinori Moda,
a utility analyst at Nikko Salomon Smith Barney in Tokyo.
    =20
``Electricity companies will likely lose after deregulation
because they don't have an alternative other than reducing prices
or losing customers,'' he said.
    =20
Japan's government on March 21 last year opened 30 percent of
the power market to competition, allowing non-utilities to retail
electricity directly to factories and other big users.
    =20
Deregulation has forced Tokyo Electric, or Tepco, and other
power utilities to reduce charges and cut costs to deter potential
market entrants.
    =20
Tepco's rate cuts in October last year will reduce the
company's sales by 130 billion yen during the six months to March,
the company said in November.
    =20
Some parts of the world, such as Scandinavia and several
northeastern U.S. states, have succeeded in deregulation by
allowing generators and their customers to agree power sale
contracts outside the pool, said Booth. That's the way the U.K.
and California are going as well, he said.
    =20
But he warned that usually there are too few power generators
in an individual market to create sufficient competition that
would allow regulators to relax.
    =20
``Even with conventional trading systems of the type that
have been successful, you still have to have enough competition to
keep people honest,'' said Booth.
