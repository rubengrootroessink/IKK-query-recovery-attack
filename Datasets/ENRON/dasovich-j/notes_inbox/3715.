I have sent Janet Covington the participant list as requested per her e-mail 
below.  She has agreed to set up the conference call for Thursday, May 3rd at 
3 PM central time.  Please reserve this time.  I will forward each of you the 
spreadsheet we receive from them today.  I will let you know if I think we 
should get together to review the spreadsheet prior to the call.   
  

Thanks,

Wanda Curry

Wanda, I spoke with Janet after you forwarded her voice mail.  I told her we 
would provide the participant list this morning.  Let me know if you want me 
to do that.

Hi Diann,

I just left a phone message for Wanda as I didn't have her email and was
supposed to coordinate the follow up call with her.  Anyway, we are still
working on preparing the account examples demonstrating the change in
methodology and should have those to you by tomorrow.  In the meantime, I
wanted to go ahead and arrange the follow up call for this Thursday 5/3 at
1pm PST.  That would be 3pm your time.  Can you please let me know the
email addresses for your participants so I can get a notice out to them.

I had yourself, Wanda Curry, Evan Hughes, Jeff Dodson, Bob Williams, Jim
Doth, and Martin Curtilan?  Not sure of the spelling.  Please let me know
so I can send out the meeting notice out with the call in details.

Thanks Much.
