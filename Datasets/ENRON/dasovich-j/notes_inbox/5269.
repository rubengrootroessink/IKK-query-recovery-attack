My comments on the fax --

Sec 1 is horrific in that it tells new generation that they must offer their 
energy to the DWR at "just and reasonable cost base price".   First, this 
sends the wrong signal to developers.  Second, I have no idea what a J&R cost 
based "price" is?  Who determines this?  Finally, Sec 2 would require that 
all generation in the state has to provide a maintenance schedule to the PUC 
- why?  What happens if an unplanned outage occurs?

This is a bad device that does nothing to 'increase supply or decrease 
demand'.
