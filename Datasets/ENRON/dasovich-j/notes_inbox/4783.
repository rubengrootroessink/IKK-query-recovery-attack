Hello Nancy -

Here's the name and email address of the contact at Enron we'll be speaking
with this Friday who wants to see the questions beforehand.  If you
wouldn't mind forwarding him the set of "Marketing" questions, I'd greatly
appreciate it.

Jeff Dasovich       jeff.dasovich@enron.com

Many thanks!
Michle
