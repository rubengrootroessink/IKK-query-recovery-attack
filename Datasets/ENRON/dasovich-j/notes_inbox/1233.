BRIENCE INFORMATION SESSION:
Date: Thursday, November 2.
Time: 12:30pm
Location: Faculty Club
Food will be served! There will be a raffle for a Palm VIIx. Please join us!

Brience was conceptualized in late 1999, and launched in March 2000 to
provide businesses with the flexibility, agility and power to meet the
challenge of mobile eBusiness. While working together at KPMG Consulting,
founders Rod McGeary, Keyur Patel, Arvin Babu and Joni Kahn had helped
countless clients including Cisco, Macromedia, Netscape, Sears, Bally's,
Bank of America, Fleet, Microsoft, and JP Morgan implement eBusiness
infrastructures to meet constantly changing market conditions and customer
demands.

The challenge they saw moving forward was to create a flexible, adaptive
approach that would meet the needs of ensuing generations of eBusiness:
generations faced with myriad devices, diverse content, the convergence of
back-end systems with customer facing operations, and an emphasis on
customization. Brience is the answer to that challenge.
Headquartered in San Francisco, Brience today has nearly 200 employees
worldwide in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Atlanta, New York, Dallas, Orlando,
Brazil and Armenia, and is still growing. The company received the largest
initial round of funding in history, with $200M from GTCR Golder Rauner
(Chicago) and Greylock (Boston) and has achieved critical milestones at a
dramatic rate: signing its first Global 1000 customer within its first month
of operation, completing beta product development in four months, and fully
staffing each and every one of its core management roles.
Brience provides the universal delivery platform for the Adaptive Web,
offering solutions that let companies easily extend their e-Business reach
to customers and employees and allow them to take advantage of new
Web-enabled business opportunities. Brience solutions are based on open,
global standards, allowing businesses to adapt their infrastructures to
changing market conditions quickly and with minimal risk. Through its
relationships with the leading visionaries of the Internet Infrastructure,
Brience ensures its customers have access to the best wireless and broadband
solutions available from the companies that are driving the future of
e-Business.
