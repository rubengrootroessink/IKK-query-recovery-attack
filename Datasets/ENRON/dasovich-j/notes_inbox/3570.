Does it apply to DA Customers as well as bundled?

SDG&E has filed today an emergency petition to modify the interruptible
program decision to offer a special programin San Diego County.  Since
several AReM members continue to do business in sDG&E's service territory,
you might be interested in it.

The program is to be known as the Rolling Blackout Reduction Program
(RBRP).  SDG&E proposes to deploy customer-owned backup emergency
generators during any ISO-declared Stage 3 event, to bring additional
generation  on-line to reduce the need to have rolling blackouts.  Based on
discussions  with customers, SDG&E expects that approximately 75 to100
additional  megawatts (MW) of additional power could be made available
through this proposed  program.    These additional megawatts of demand
reduction are  critical to offset San Diego's anticipated share of ISO
mandated statewide firm  load reductions.  SDG&E expects that the ISO will
most likely require  1,000 MW of statewide reductions during Stage 3 firm
load reduction  events.  SDG&E's share of this 1,000 MW is 7.4% or 74 MW.
Therefore, 75 to 100 MW of additional backup generation can reasonably be
expected to reduce the number and duration of rotating outages in San
Diego.

The RBRP is designed to run for a year, beginning on May 15, 2001  and pay
capacity incentives each month for six months starting  May 15,  2001 and
continuing through November 15, 2001.  Its availability for Summer  2002
will be determined after the upcoming summer.  SDG&E proposes that  this
program be implemented only in San Diego county at this time.
Participating customers must have a backup emergency generator that is
capable  of providing at least 15 percent of customers' annual maximum
demand, but not  less than 100 kW.  Customers' participation in the program
is entirely  voluntary but would require a firm commitment and be supported
by both a  contract and other tariff obligations, terms, and conditions.
As discussed  more fully below, participating customers will earn incentive
payments for their  actual load reduction, and in addition, if a customer's
load reduction is  sufficiently great, the customer also will receive a
circuit exemption.

Once SDG&E receives notification from the ISO that a Stage 3 event  and
rolling outages have been declared, SDG&E would, in turn, notify
participating customers to reduce demand through the use of their backup
generation.  Customers would be required to reduce demand as quickly as
possible but no later than 15 minutes after the customer receives the
notification.  SDG&E would offset the amount of generation brought on  line
against the amount specified by the ISO the Stage 3 event for the load
curtailment to achieve the necessary load drop.   If SDG&E were  required
to curtail more load than the backup generation provides, or should  load
reduction be required faster than the generators could be started, then
SDG&E would follow its normal curtailment plan to meet the full ISO
requirement for load reduction, net of the load reduction on the system
caused  by the customer-owned backup generation.  The backup generators
will run  until ISO no longer requires a firm load reduction and all firm
load is back in  service.  SDG&E's proposed tariff imposes no program
limits on how  often SDG&E may call upon a customer to run its backup
generator.   These and other terms and conditions are specified in  SDG&E's
proposed tariff, which appears as Attachment B to this  Petition.

Do any AReM members want to support this proposal?
