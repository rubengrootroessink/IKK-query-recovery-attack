Indian Official in Enron Talks Retracts Resignation (Update5)

INDIA: UPDATE 1-India state panel head to resume Enron talks.

BOMBAY, May 23 (Reuters) - India's Maharashtra state averted a crisis on 
Wednesday when it persuaded the head of a panel renegotiating U.S. energy 
giant Enron's troubled Dabhol power project to remain in his job. 
Madhav Godbole, who quit earlier on Wednesday, said he was returning after 
the state cabinet unanimously rejected his offer to resign.
"They have bestowed confidence in me," he told Reuters. 
Godbole's resignation over remarks made against him by a senior politician 
had created a stir and looked likely to derail efforts to resolve a raging 
row between Houston-based Enron Corp. and the Maharashtra State Electricity 
Board (MSEB). 
Enron's $2.9 billion project in the western state of Maharashtra is widely 
seen as a test case for India's plans to privatise its power sector. 
Godbole was heading a committee to renegotiate the contract between Dabhol 
Power Company (DPC), owned 65 percent by Enron, and state utility Maharashtra 
State Electricity Board (MSEB), which has been embroiled in dispute for over 
six months. 
The dispute was sparked off last month when MSEB began defaulting on monthly 
payments to DPC, which is building the 2,184 megawatts power plant in the 
state. 
The first phase of 740 MW of the project is already up and running, while the 
second phase of 1,444 MW is slated to be completed next month. 
After months of wrangling over a payments dispute with the cash-strapped 
state electricity board, DPC last Saturday issued a preliminary notice to 
terminate its contract to sell power to the utility. 
Dabhol's termination notice was widely seen as a first step by Enron to pull 
out of the power project. 
MSEB is planning to retaliate by imposing a fine of four billion rupees 
($85.16 million) on the power firm. 
Godhole was appointed last month to resolve this dispute. 
The next meeting of the committee, which was due to meet with DPC officials 
on Wednesday, may be held next Tuesday, he said. 
Meanwhile, a senior banker told Reuters that local lenders to DPC were 
planning to seek the help of the federal government in ensuring that foreign 
lenders did not invoke guarantees that they have issued. 
The Business Standard newspaper said the losses of the local lenders would 
amount to nearly 30 billion rupees if the guarantees were invoked. ($1=46.97 
Indian rupees).

Dutch NMa To Decide On Import Capacity Complaints By Sept

05/23/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

AMSTERDAM -(Dow Jones)- Dutch competition authority NMa doesn't expect to 
reach a decision on complaints filed by several large market parties on the 
way cross-border electricity transportation capacity is allocated before the 
end of August, a commission on the subject said Wednesday during a hearing. 
The commission needs to hear the response to these complaints from Sep, or 
Nea, as the umbrella association for Dutch electricity generators is now 
called, before it can make a decision on the matter.
A representative of Nea said the organization couldn't respond on Wednesday 
as it "needs more time to prepare." 
Several large parties in the Dutch energy market Wednesday appeared before 
the commission to elaborate on previously submitted complaints on the way 
cross-border electricity transport capacity is currently allocated. 
The complaints heard by the commission showed grave concerns that existing 
mechanisms are driving up electricity prices and hampering the development of 
a free market instead of fostering it, as the Dutch government had aimed to 
do. 
At the hearing in The Hague, Cecile Gommans of the antitrust regulator NMa, 
who heads the committee on the subject, said complaints focus on the 
privileged position Nea members have in the allocation of import capacity and 
the rules for the auctions through which the remaining capacity is 
distributed in the markets. 
Three out of the four Nea members are owned by German and Belgian companies 
who control the interconnectors on the other side of the Dutch border. As 
such, half of the proceeds from such auctions accrue to the parent companies 
of the Nea members. 
Of the 3,900 megawatts of total import capacity available, over 900 MW are 
reserved for Nea. Other participants for whom the capacity available to them 
is therefore limited feel the market mechanism has failed to deliver access 
to imported power on equal terms. 
The complaints on the way auctions of import capacity are conducted are 
mostly on entering conditions for parties who want to bid. Smaller parties 
feel rigid rules for that are practically excluding them from the auctions. 
The capacity auctions are held by the TenneT Auction Office, a wholly-owned 
subsidiary of Dutch grid operator TenneT. 
The complaints submitted NMa include those from Enron Corp. (ENE), Dutch 
energy intensive consumer group VEMW and Dutch chemicals industry association 
VNCI. 
After Nea's response, which is scheduled for mid-June, the NMa expects to 
decide on the complaints "within 10 weeks", Gommans said.

Clean Power Group Comments on Report of The National Energy Policy 
Development Group

05/23/2001
PR Newswire
(Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire)

ARLINGTON, Va., May 23 /PRNewswire/ -- The Clean Power Group commends the 
National Energy Policy Development Group for identifying key issues that the 
U.S. must address in order to ensure an adequate, stable, diverse, affordable 
and environmentally sound electric power supply. Last week the President 
said, "procedures intended to protect the environment have too often blocked 
environmental progress by discouraging companies from installing newer and 
cleaner equipment." The Clean Power Group has developed a specific regulatory 
proposal that implements the recommendations laid out in the Administration 
Plan. The proposal improves on the existing regulatory structure that retards 
both environmental progress and development of new power generation. "We're 
gratified that the Bush plan highlights the same priorities that we have 
identified as means of expanding power generation while improving 
environmental protection. We hope that they will consider our approach as a 
means of implementing their recommendations," says Joel Bluestein, Director 
of the Clean Power Group. He added, "Now it is up to both parties in Congress 
to come together to develop pro-environment, pro-growth and pro-efficiency 
policies that leave behind the economy vs. the environment rhetoric that 
always characterized energy policy debates. The truth is, we can have it all 
if we do this right." 
The Clean Power Group includes Calpine, El Paso Corp., Enron, NiSource, and 
Trigen Energy. The Group was formed to identify improved regulatory 
approaches that will encourage the development of cleaner, more efficient 
generation from new and existing sources. The Clean Power Group proposal uses 
proven market-based regulatory approaches with innovative new components to 
simplify regulation of the power generation sector while ensuring 
environmental results that are as good as, and likely better than existing 
programs. The program limits the cost of the reductions while encouraging the 
development and application of new technologies for all fuels, renewables and 
end-use efficiency (conservation). The proposal includes reform of the New 
Source Review program and would expedite the development of increased 
generation from new and existing sources without sacrificing the environment. 
If the U.S. chooses to regulate CO2 emissions, the structure of the proposal 
could also be the basis for addressing CO2 in a measured and productive way.
The plan is based on a national cap and trade system that sets emission caps 
that get progressively tighter over time. In this way, the proposal provides 
a guarantee that the environment will always be getting cleaner. "Cap and 
trade systems have proven effective and cost effective in the SO2 program, 
and more recently in the Ozone Transport Region NOx trading program," said 
Bluestein. Because it ensures continuing reductions in overall emissions, the 
Clean Power Group proposal could replace current NSR requirements. Unlike 
other proposals that have been promoted, this plan provides better 
environmental performance than existing regulation, and would apply to new 
and existing generation. 
New Source Review regulations were intended to ensure that every new 
investment in new generation, or improvement in existing generation, was made 
cleaner than what was built before. These regulations have not worked well 
for existing facilities, which have avoided reducing their emissions but have 
also been discouraged from improving their performance. At the same time, the 
regulations can discourage new investment and slow down approval time for 
clean and efficient new and re-powering projects. "The Clean Power Group 
believes that we should not try to reform NSR if we cannot put something 
better for the environment in its place," said Bluestein. "Consequently, the 
group's proposal marries what industry needs, which is technological 
flexibility, economic certainty, and predictability with guarantees for 
environmental progress that current regulations hoped to get but don't quite 
deliver." 
Among the recommendations of the Energy Plan that are directly addressed by 
the Clean Power Group Proposal are: -- Development of a multi-pollutant 
regulatory strategy for power 
generation. 
-- Increased use of new technology for environmental improvement. 
-- Increased certainty for coal power generators through clear policies 
that can be applied to business decisions. 
-- National priority for increasing energy efficiency. 
-- Encouragement of combined heat and power (CHP). 
-- Addressing concerns with New Source Review (NSR) policies. 
-- Encouraging market-based solutions and international applications of 
U.S. technologies. 
-- Development of innovative technologies and regulatory approaches for 
the mitigation of climate change gases.

UK: ANALYSIS-Spanish power trade hots up after slow start.

05/23/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

(Fixes typo in para 3) 
By Margaret Orgill
LONDON, May 23 (Reuters) - Volumes in Spain's electricity derivatives trading 
market have risen sharply in the first quarter of the year, boosted by the 
arrival of new players and unexpectedly volatile wholesale power prices. 
Wholesale prices hit record highs last autumn after a summer drought slashed 
output from hydroelectric stations but have slumped by 30 percent this year 
after heavy winter rains filled reservoirs, increasing power production. 
"Prices have been all over the place. The good hydro conditions raise the 
risk for thermal generators like Endesa and Union Fenosa," said Ben Tait of 
UK-based analysts Prospex. 
According to Prospex, trading volumes climbed to around 7.9 terawatt hours in 
the first quarter of the year compared with 4.3 TWh in the whole of 2000. 
There were about 300 deals in the quarter but the forward curve remains short 
- trades for 2002 made up less than one percent of volume in the quarter. 
Spain trades physical power through a central electricity pool set up in 1998 
when liberalisation started. 
In the over-the-counter (OTC) market, companies trade derivatives, which are 
financial swaps contracts settled against pool prices. 
ONLY A HANDFUL OF REGULAR TRADERS 
About 12 participants are present in the market although only five or six 
trade frequently. 
Regular traders include U.S. utility Enron, Belgian company Electrabel, 
U.S.-owned TXU and Portuguese REN which is part of the Electricidade de 
Portugal group. 
London-based Axia Energy, a recently created joint venture between between 
U.S. companies Entergy and Koch, says it is looking at the Spanish market. 
Traders mentioned that Union Fenosa and Electricite de France had recently 
entered the market or become more active. 
German utilities RWE and E.ON are also expected to make their debut soon. 
STILL TINY COMPARED WITH OTHER POWER MARKETS 
Despite the increase, the Spanish OTC electricity derivatives market remains 
tiny compared with more mature markets like Germany and the UK and is dwarfed 
by volumes traded in the local electricity pool. 
"Compared to Spanish consumption...Spanish OTC trading is still minimal," 
said Prospex in a report on the sector. 
"First quarter total volumes equate to just 14 percent or so of Spanish 
demand. In advanced power markets, OTC trading is not a fraction of 
consumption but a considerable multiple." 
Analysts say the market is trapped in a vicious cycle, with low liquidity 
deterring new entrants needed to boost volumes further. 
"There are no real market makers. The wide spreads and thin liquidity make it 
difficult to take big positions," Rafael Abati, managing director of 
U.S.-owned Sempra Energy Trading, told a recent energy conference in Madrid. 
"Big variations from one day to another create difficulties in closing 
positions," he added. 
Traders say Spain will remain on the margins of the European power trading 
scene unless there are reforms in the electricity sector to end the dominance 
of Endesa and Iberdrola and encourage new entrants. 
"The problem in Spain is the market structure does not encourage OTC trading. 
There are no independent retailers or generators of any sizable volume in 
Spain," said Simon Baker, head of TXU Espana. 
Sempra's Abati said the market will only expand significantly when Endesa and 
Iberdrola, which control 80 percent of Spain's electricity market, decide to 
become more involved in derivatives trading. 
Both companies are vertically integrated and so have little incentive to use 
derivatives to hedge their risk. 
"There's no real risk sensation among the main players in the physical 
market," Abati told the conference. 
"They are vertically integrated so don't need these tools to hedge price and 
volume risk." 
Spain is opening its electricity markets in stages, echoing a trend in 
Europe. Fifty five percent of the sector is now liberalised and the 
government has ordered full deregulation by 2003, ahead of the timetable 
recently proposed by the European Union.

Indian Official in Enron Talks Retracts Resignation (Update5)
2001-05-23 10:07 (New York)

Indian Official in Enron Talks Retracts Resignation (Update5)

     (Rewrites first section with withdrawal of resignation by
negotiator.)

     Mumbai, May 23 (Bloomberg) -- India's chief negotiator in a
payment dispute with Enron Corp. withdrew his resignation today,
saying talks to forge a compromise are likely to resume early next
week.
     Madhav Godbole, a former chairman of the Maharashtra State
Electricity Board, said he was retracting his resignation in
response to a request from the state government.
     ``I have received a letter from the Maharashtra chief
minister requesting me to withdraw my resignation and saying the
cabinet had unanimously placed its full faith in the negotiating
committee,'' he said in an interview.
     Dabhol Power Co., 65 percent owned by Houston-based Enron,
the world's biggest energy trader, on Saturday began a procedure
to end its power supply contract with the state electricity board
by serving a ``preliminary termination notice.'' If a compromise
is not found, Enron may have to sell its assets and pull out of
the $3 billion project, the country's largest single foreign
investment.
     Godbole quit from the committee Wednesday morning after his
handling of the talks with Dabhol was criticized by a former
Maharashtra chief minister whose party is a partner in the ruling
coalition, dealing a potential setback to efforts for a
compromise.
     ``It was necessary to convey the message that you can't take
liberties with the chairman of the committee and there needs to be
freedom for functioning,'' the official said of his resignation.

                              Dispute

     Dabhol is owed 3 billion rupees ($64 million) by the
electricity board for power supplied in December and January. The
board has refused to pay because it said the bills should be lower
to reflect a penalty Dabhol should pay for failing to supply power
at full capacity.
     India's federal and state governments, which have guaranteed
payments for power by the board and some of the loans to help fund
the project, may have to pay Dabhol more than 170 billion rupees
if it carries through termination of the 2,184 megawatt project.
     A planned meeting between the state electricity board and
Dabhol officials was canceled today after Godbole's resignation.
     ``A meeting will take place mostly probably next Tuesday. But
we will have to discuss and decide on a date,'' Godbole said after
withdrawing his resignation.

                            Statements

     He said earlier today that he resigned because of
``statements made against me'' by Sharad Pawar, leader of the
Nationalist Congress Party in the state's ruling coalition. The
decision to quit was ``well-considered,'' he said.
     The Economic Times quoted Pawar as saying ``a person with a
positive attitude should head the renegotiation panel. A
pessimistic disposition about Enron will further antagonize the
two parties.''
     Pawar was the state's chief minister when Enron first signed
the power supply agreement with the electricity board.
     Anti-Enron activists went to Godbole's residence in South
Mumbai to try to persuade him to return to the negotiating
committee, as they view him as a supporter of their cause.
     ``It's important to get him back,'' said Pradyumna Kaul, an
activist with Enron Virodhi Andolan, a non-governmental
organization opposed to the project. Still, he said Godbole's
resignation has helped focus attention on the need for a solution.

                         Press Conference

     At a press conference, Maharashtra Chief Minister Vilasrao
Deshmukh said the state government hasn't accepted Godbole's
resignation and would attempt to ``clear all the
misunderstandings'' with the negotiator to persuade him to return.
     Chhagan Bhujbal, deputy chief minister of the Maharashtra
government, and a member of the Nationalist Congress Party, said
his party supports Godbole.
     Three other members of the negotiating committee led by
Godbole, including Deepak Parekh, chairman of Housing Development
Finance Corp., India's biggest home mortgage lender, quit citing
personal reasons.
     The committee was set up by Maharashtra after Dabhol in April
authorized its Managing Director Wade Cline to cancel the power
supply contract.
     Enron has called on India's federal government to ensure a
resolution of the dispute.
     ``I am awaiting the return of the power minister who is
abroad,'' Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha told reporters in New
Delhi. Power Minister Suresh Prabhu was in France and is returning
later today.
