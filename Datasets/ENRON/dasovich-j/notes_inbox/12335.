Paul Dawson - I suggest that you pick this up, a chance to ingratiate 
yourself to Ian.  I suggest you contact Ian and explore Edward Barker's 
willingness to commute from LA to SF, on a nearly weekly basis.  You might 
tell Ian that we really have nothing of interest, i.e., no real presence, in 
LA, but are willing to use him in SF (if nothing else, we made the offer, 
which Ian will appreciate).  I will not involve myself further, unless you 
think I can add some value in communicating with Ian.   thanks  mcs

If it's no cost to Enron, and if he's good and willing to commute to SF, and 
if it would be beneficial to the Company, we could certainly use the help and 
put him to work on interesting things.  

But do we we want to infect someone with the lunacy of California regulation 
and then potentially infect the UK?  Seriously, we can make it work if folks 
think that it makes sense.

Best,
Jeff
