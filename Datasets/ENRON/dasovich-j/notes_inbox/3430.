FYI:

With all of the free time you will have this summer, why not do some career
planning.

If you want to work on: a job search strategy, updating your resume,
practicing interviewing, learning how to hire and interview people for
yourself, conducting a targeted job search, networking tips, updating your
resume, salary negotiations tips, deciding what you want to be when you
grow-up or any other career related issues, I will be here all summer to
assist you.

If you anticipate having any special career needs in the coming year please
let me know.  During the summer I will be doing a lot of planning and
scheduling of events for the coming year, if you having anything in
particular you would like to have offered either on an individual or group
basis please let me know

Remember we can work together via phone, fax, email or in person.  You do
not have to be on campus to utilize the services.  Plus, read your Haas
emails during the summer, that is how I will be sending out announcements
for upcoming events.

Everyone have a great summer.
