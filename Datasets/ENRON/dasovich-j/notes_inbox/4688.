Attached is a list of parties the Cal ISO has identified in an earlier report 
that had "overcharged" the market from May - Nov 2000 (the filing was 
mistakenly put into the FERC docket room).

EES is listed as party B8 with $27.9 MM as Excessive Rents.

The biggest overcharger was BC Powerex with $176.2 MM.

We are still analyzing the implications of this list and will get out any 
other information.

Attached is a fax I received of a filing the ISO made yesterday afternoon to 
supplement its comments in Docket No. EL00-95-012 regarding market monitoring 
and mitigation.  The filing links the names of the suppliers and importers 
discussed in Dr. Sheffrin's analysis to the code numbers used in yesterday's 
filing.  The ISO had requested confidential treatment.  The fax is in TIFF 
format and you can disregard the first page as it is a cover sheet to me.  
Please let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.
