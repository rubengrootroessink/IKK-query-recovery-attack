Panel topic questions:
o       What short and long-term trends can be expected in Bay Area job
market for director level and above, executive candidates?
o       What are up and coming industries or fields in the Bay Area job
market. How can those jobs best be accessed?
o       Assume a job candidate has experience at Internet start-up
companies, perhaps several over the past 2 years. How should Internet
start-up experience be leveraged towards next career decision? How should
this experience be presented to next potential employer, especially if the
companies went out of business? Will candidates be penalized if they have
jumped from Internet start-up to Internet start-up over the past several=20
years?
o       How does the job market of San Francisco compare to that of Silicon
Valley/South Bay? Is it worth it for residents of San Francisco to commute
or relocate to Silicon Valley/South Bay?
o       What skills or experiences are necessary to make the jump from
senior director level to vice president? From vice president to COO?
o       In the past few years there was a glut of senior job titles at
start-up companies. Do you believe some people will have to downgrade their
title in their next career moves?
o       Assume a job candidate has received an MBA degree from a top
ranking school 5 years ago and has successfully progressed up an executive
level management career. At that point, what is the relative importance of
