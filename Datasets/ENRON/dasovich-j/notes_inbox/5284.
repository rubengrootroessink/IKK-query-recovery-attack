Jeff:

I thought you were going to do this one.  I can if you need me to.  That is
fine.]

Mark:

I really liked what you did especially the Dupont analysis.  I added some
stuff about the increased riskiness of the stock, and well on additional
benefits from the increased outside influence higher debt has on the
actions of management.

Anyway, here are my additions.  I am working tomorrow so I will check my 
email.
