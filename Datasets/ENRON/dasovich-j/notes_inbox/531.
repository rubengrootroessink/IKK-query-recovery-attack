FYI:

This is Joseph utilizing Bruno's old e-mail to notify you or remind you if 
you were already aware that:
 1) I've been moved from the EES mail group and now can be found under "NA" 
(Corp); 
 2) If you use my "old" EES e-mail address I'm not going to receive it; 
 3) At this time, I can only "read" my e-mail by going through Bruno's 
e-mail; 
 4) I am currently unable to access my own e-mail -- or anything else, for 
that matter -- under my "new" e-mail address as  I have been virtually unable 
to utilize my "new & improved" (I'm trying to be diplomatic here, not my 
forte!), pc since being  "upgraded"* to Windows 2000.  

*"French" for my computer won't work no matter what they do to it.

Thanks,

Joseph Alamo
