As you know, an anonymous party filed a FOIA request with FERC on March 1, 
2001 seeking the certain appendices that the CAISO filed with FERC on a 
confidential basis on March 1, 2001.  Those filings contain aggregate bidd 
data for December and January.

Last Friday, I filed the attached letter with FERC indicating that we would 
oppose releasing the materials until we are able to learn more about what is 
contained in the ISO appendices.  (I have attached a copy of our letter for 
those who have not received it.)

Today, I received a call today from FERC's FOIA Officer informing me that 
SoCal Edison has formally requested FERC to provide it with copies of all 
letters and other responses related to the FOIA request.  I guess we now know 
who made the request (big surprise).
