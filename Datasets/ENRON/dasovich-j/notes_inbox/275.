Subject: MEETING RE: CALIFORNIA




By this e-mail I'm requesting that we all meet on Wednesday, September 13, 
2000,
for breakfast to discuss the California/FERC wholesale issues that have been
plaguing us and will plague us over the next year or so.   I suggest that the
meeting be limited to:  (1) an identification of the inventory of forums we 
are
facing; and (2) our allocation of resources to the inventory.  If time 
permits,
we can also have a substantive discussion of the issues.  In this regard, if 
its
ready, we can present an overview of the California strategy that is being
developed (initially) by Sandi and Jeff.

Respond ASAP directly to Lysa Akin with your interest in participating in this
meeting.

Lysa:  once we have a head count, please get us a meeting room and breakfast.
We'll need an easel with paper and markers.
