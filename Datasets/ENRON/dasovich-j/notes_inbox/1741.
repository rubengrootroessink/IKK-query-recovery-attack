1. Individual Investors' Worst Bloopers
------------------------------------------------------------

The more investment fads change, the more they stay the
same.  Here's a sobering look at schemes and crazes over the
centuries that tempted and punished individual investors.
The Great Tulip Mania, the U.S. railroad boom and the
English Chunnel seemed foolproof at their peak, but only
foolhardy today.

------------------------------------------------------------
2. Information Isn't Experience
------------------------------------------------------------

Too much information can be as hazardous to your financial
health as too little.  Our commentator proposes how to keep a
clear mind amidst the info glut.

------------------------------------------------------------
3. Money Memories: a Young Mom in the '60s
------------------------------------------------------------

What was the economic zeitgeist when you were growing up? A
writer recalls her middle-class youth in a New York suburb
during the 1950s and '60s.

------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------
5. Stock Explorer(tm)
------------------------------------------------------------

Stock Explorer, Schwab's newest screening tool, is a great
way to generate potential investing ideas.  Stock Explorer
uses six well-known investing strategies to create a list of
stocks.  For example, you can screen candidates within
categories such as Growth at a Reasonable Price or Tech
Companies Showing Profits, and then see how they would fit
within your portfolio.  Want to drill deeper on a particular
stock? Stock Explorer allows you to link directly to a
one-page summary Equity Report Card.


Stock Explorer is located in The Analyst Center under the
Investing Tools tab.

6. CEO Speaker Series--Schedule Change
------------------------------------------------------------

Mr. Millard Drexler
President and CEO
Gap Inc.
CANCELLED


Mr. Millard Drexler, President and CEO of Gap, Inc., will be
unable to participate in the November CEO Speaker Series as

------------------------------------------------------------
7. Argus Roundtable
------------------------------------------------------------

Topic: Special Situations and Contrarian Ideas
Date: Wednesday, November 29, 7:00 p.m. ET

This was supposed to be the year of the New Economy.  So why are
old-economy sectors such as  Electric Utilities and Real Estate
Investment Trusts the top performers?  Looking ahead to 2001,
we'll preview some sectors and offer contrarian ideas that may
offer similar surprises.

the Argus Roundtable, click here:

------------------------------------------------------------
8. The Place for Smart Investors!
------------------------------------------------------------

Have you taken a tour of the Smart Investor tab at
schwab.com? You'll find objective investment information,
articles and online courses--plus the opportunity to
communicate with experts and other investors.

http://schwab.ed4.net/go/t8/nov/sig/smartinvestors/

------------------------------------------------------------
9. Price Alerts: Keep an Eye on Your Investments
------------------------------------------------------------

Schwab Price Alerts help you keep up with a fast-changing
market.  Price Alerts are triggered by criteria you select in
advance for your securities.  If one of your security's
market price rises above or drops below a value you specify,
Schwab will send you an Alert by email or pager device.
It's an easy way for you to stay in touch with the market.

http://schwab.ed4.net/go/t9/nov/sig/pricealerts/

------------------------------------------------------------
10. Active Trader Pricing Gets Even Better!
------------------------------------------------------------

Pay as low as $14.95 for automated equity trades.  With
tiered pricing, the more you trade, the less you pay in
commissions--resulting in consistently lower commissions
for consistently active traders.
