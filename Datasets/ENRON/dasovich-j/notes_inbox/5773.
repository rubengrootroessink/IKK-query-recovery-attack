> Attached below are electronic copies of the President's memorandum and the
> Secretary of Energy's Order, which we just received, directing PG&E's gas
> suppliers to keep selling gas to PG&E.
>
> The President's memorandum includes two sentences that appear in
> crossed-out form in the electronic copy attached below.  These two
> sentences do NOT appear in the final copy signed today by President
> Clinton, a copy of which we received by facsimile from DOE.  The excised
> text would have kept the President's emergency findings in effect for 120
> days, as PG&E requested.  But the final text, which bears President
> Clinton's signature, does not include that ruling.  (showing us a
> last-minute change made in the White House.)
>
> The short duration of these orders comes as something of a disappointment.
> But we have made history here.  Never before has the Defense Production
> Act been used to address an energy supply shortfall.  And, the Natural Gas
> Policy Act emergency powers upon which the President and Secretary also
> rely have never been invoked before at all.
>
> Now the work begins of contacting the gas suppliers.
