They gotta go.  The heat on Loretta is starting to rise.  Be interesting to 
see if anything comes of it.

FYI:  Got your message re: swap IOU bailout for end to investigations.  What 
do you think about having Ken Lay, when he delivers the offer to Peevey 
tomorrow, "raising" the usefulness of ending the investigations as a means of 
getting all of this mess back on a rational, constructive track, which is 
what Peevey sez he and the governor want?
