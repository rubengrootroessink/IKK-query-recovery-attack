Energy Systems Update for Wednesday, May 9 at 8:00am:
The California Independent System Operator has declared a "WARNING" which
will extend though the hour 2359 due to forecasted high loads and
temperatures throughout the control area.

Consumers are requested to voluntarily curtail nonessential electric load to
avoid more severe conditions including involuntary curtailments.

ISO may be required to call a Stage 2 including nonfirm by mid-morning.  The
ISO indicated a Stage 3 emergency and firm load shedding is possible today.

If outages occur they will begin with Block 1.

Communications are expected to be similiar to yesterday. Any further
specific changes in operating conditions will be communicated with
additional Grid Updates.
