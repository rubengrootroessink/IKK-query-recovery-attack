2 challenges I see
We do not want the "rate freeze" to end but we do want a interim rate 
increase.  What about a tenporary tax as a solution.  We like taxes in our 
contracts - flow through.  And it does not require ending rate freeze
I think the  front part could be stonger with references to AB1890??
