Dear All,

> Attached is this week's legislative report.
>
> Republicans are still voting against the state's spending budget, citing a
> tax increase of one-quarter of a cent in the state's sales tax. Without a
> state budget in place, essential state services cannot be done such as
> issuing checks to many contractors as well as to lawmakers, legislative
> staffers, constitutional officers, and administration appointees. Civil
> service workers will still be able to recover their paychecks, however
> trial courts do not appear to collect any state funds to cover payroll and
> administrative costs.
>
> Meanwhile, this week's energy-related events and legislative highlights
> include:
>
>
> EVENTS:
>
> * Two new "whistleblowers" from the former San Diego Gas & Electric
> Company came forth on Thursday morning, alleging further accusations of
> price manipulation and unsafe working conditions by Duke Energy. These two
> former employees were introduced at a press conference by Lt. Governor
> Cruz Bustamante and Assembly Member Barbara Matthews to "further expand
> upon testimony" provided by three former Duke employees last week.
> Meanwhile, the Senate Energy Price Manipulation Select Committee chaired
> by Senator Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana) will meet this upcoming Tuesday and vote
> on contempt citations against generators Mirant and Enron who failed to
> comply with subpoenas for documents. According to the committee, six other
> suppliers of energy -- AES, Williams, Reliant, Dynegy, Duke and ERG --
> have until Tuesday to turn over documents.
>
> * The state PUC cancelled its continuation meeting on Tuesday, dealing
> with the "suspension of the right of retail end users of electricity to
> acquire service from providers other than the DWR or a public entity" and
> any other items relating to the DWR's Power Supply Revenue Bonds. Written
> letters received by the Department of Finance, State Treasurer's Office,
> and the DWR all urged the PUC to postpone its hearing until mid-August so
> that interested parties can resolve their issues.
>
> * State Controller Connell released unedited versions of $43 billion
> worth of power contracts with 18 power generators negotiated by the
> governor's energy consultants on Monday. These contracts specifically
> state which companies are selling energy to the state as well as at what
> cost, the duration of the contract, and from where the energy is
> generated. Further information released includes reference to millions of
> dollars already paid towards the long-term energy contracts in addition to
> the $2.8 million for special energy consultants to the governor. Connell
> says that the contracts were negotiated at the "worst possible times, for
> higher prices, and longer periods than necessary."
>
> * The CalISO acknowledged on Monday responsibility for swings in the
> electrical production at a power plant owned by Duke Energy. This is
> significant because Duke had been the subject of allegation of market
> manipulation by former employees in Senator Dunn's surprise committee
> hearing last week. In a document to its oversight board, the ISO states
> records show that Duke merely was following its orders to adjust output to
> help balance the statewide grid and not drive up prices.
>
> * Governor Davis announced late last Friday that Mark Fabiani will no
> longer serve as one of his strategic communications consultants, keeping
> Chris Lehane as his communications consultant with a salary equal to
> former Communications Director Phil Trounstine. Mr. Lehane will continue
> to provide support in "addressing the state's energy-related challenges"
> and "manage all of the state's agency and department public information
> officers" as well as "relinquish his SCE consulting agreement for the term
> of his state contract."
>
>
> LEGISLATION:
>
> * AB 51xx -- Electrical generation -- by Assembly Member Sarah Reyes
> (D-Fresno) was heard in the Assembly Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, and
> passed out with 7 AYES, 0 NOES, and 3 ABSTENTIONS. Despite this vote, the
> committee requested (and the author agreed) that the bill be re-heard in
> the Assembly Judiciary Committee following action of the bill by the
> Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee. This bill addressed
> whether or not an operator of an electric generation facility that reduces
> or discontinues service for financial gain be held liable for damages as a
> result of the reduction or discontinuance in energy output. IEP submitted
> an opposition letter and will continue to oppose this bill.
>
>
> UPCOMING LEGISLATION:
>
> IEP has submitted letters of opposition for the following bills, except AB
> 28xx (Migden). The Board has directed IEP to remain neutral on this bill.
>
> * SB 23xx (Soto) Public power districts on Monday, July 9 in the
> Senate Appropriations Committee at 8:30 a.m..
> * SB 1xx (Soto) Personal income and bank and corporation taxes:
> electrical windfall profits tax: consumer credit on Monday, July 9 in the
> Assembly Revenue & Taxation Committee at 1:30 p.m.
> * SB 39xx (Speier) Public utilities on Monday, July 9 in the Assembly
> Energy Costs and Availability Committee at 2:30 p.m. This bill was
> initially scheduled to be heard on Monday, July 2; however, the committee
> hearing was postponed and rescheduled to the 9th.)
> * AB 28xx (Migden) Electrical restructuring: Oversight Board:
> Independent Service Operator on Tuesday, July 10 in the Senate Energy,
> Utilities & Communications Committee at 1:30 p.m.
> * AB 65xx (Cardoza) Fuel: illegal business practices on Wednesday,
> July 11 in the Assembly Appropriations Committee at 9:30 a.m.
> * AB 81 (Migden) Property taxation: state-assessed property on
> Wednesday, July 11 in the Senate Revenue & Taxation Committee at 1:30 p.m.
