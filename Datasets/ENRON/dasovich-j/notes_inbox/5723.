> Last Thursday, January 18th, PG&E filed an Emergency Application which
> asked the CPUC to declare an natural gas emergency and exercise its
> authority to order SoCalGas to provide assistance by purchasing gas for
> PG&E's core customers.  Today, the CPUC issued an order shortening the
> time parties have to respond to PG&E's Application to this Friday, January
> 26th, and gave PG&E until Wednesday, January 31st to reply.  A copy of the
> order from ALJ Wong is attached.  This schedule suggests that the
> Commission does not plan to act on PG&E's Application this week or next
> week.  Randy
