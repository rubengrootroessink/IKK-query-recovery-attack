My pleasure, our pleasure.? We had a great time, got way far away. Much 
laughter tightened by abbs...? And, you know that we truly love toiling away 
on the property.? 

And, yes, I'll let Karen know that youze guys are available to adhere stuff 
to the boards.... we'll let you know. 

....returning to this place makes my brain feel like a TAHHT MOH!
