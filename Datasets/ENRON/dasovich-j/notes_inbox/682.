Dear Signature Services(TM) Client,

Your Schwab Access(TM) account has been opened.  You should
receive a package containing instructions for using your account
and your account number within 3-5 business days.  For security
reasons we cannot send your account number via e-mail.  If you
are opening both a new Schwab One and a Schwab Access account,
you will receive information for each account separately.

You will also receive the following packages and features within
10 business days.
*  Schwab Access checks
*  Gold Visa(R) debit card (if requested)
*  Schwab BillPay(TM) package (if requested)

For security, you will receive the PIN number for your Gold Visa
debit card shortly after you get your card.  You will also
receive a separate mailing with your Schwab BillPay security code.

To get a feel for the experience and features of your new account,
test-drive the demo at:  http://www.schwab.com/accessdemo

Logging in to Your New Account
-------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Once you have your new account number, log into the Customer
Center by clicking on:
https://investing.schwab.com/trading/start

2. Enter your 8-digit account number and temporary password
(the last 4 digits of your Social Security number).  To
protect your account, remember to establish your own unique
password immediately after logging in for the first time.


For Customers Who Already Have a Schwab One Account
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Please make sure that you have funded your new Schwab Access
account to adequately cover your outstanding transactions. Any
outstanding Schwab One checks, Visa debit card transactions, ATM
withdrawals and bill payments are now debited to your Schwab Access
account.  If you need to move funds between accounts, log into
schwab.com, click on "Move Money" and then "Between Schwab Accounts".


Contact Us
------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you have any questions about your Schwab Access account,
please call 1-888-274-5738 or contact Schwab Signature Services.

We thank you for choosing Schwab.
