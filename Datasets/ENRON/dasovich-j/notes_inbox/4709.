Alan --

Not sure if the West Desk is interested in Demand Bidding issues with the 
ISO, but wanted you to loop around with the commercial people to see if there 
are any specific problems with the current ISO programs.  

Please communicate any issues with Harry Kingerski.

Jim

We are working to get demand bidding into CA legislation (AB31X).  The ISO 
wants from us our laundry list of issues of why their existing programs are 
inadequate.  This is a great opportunity to influence them.

Neil and Jubran, could you give us your specific issues and suggestions?  Jay 
and Fred, any suggestions would be great from you also.  

We will set up a call for Monday at 4 pm CST to discuss and will get phone 
number out to you.  Thanks.

Here is a note from Mike Florio of the ISO Board.  This is encouraging, he
wants to talk further about how the ISO programs can be changed to
accomplish what we want.  What would be most helpful is an item by item
analysis by EES (read: Harry and his people) as to why the existing or
proposed ISO programs are inadequate (or why we need to have 31X amended to
have the ISO do programs for direct access customers parallel to the utility
programs in 31X.)  I need this information soon in order to keep the
dialogue going with Florio.  Thanks for your help.  Mike Day

Just to show how up to speed I am, I thought that the ISO was already 
planning to do this.  Their presentation on demand programs at the last 
board meeting showed a scheduling coordinator option and a UDC option, with 
different billing and settlement provisions for each.  But it's hard for me 
to judge what is adequate (and user-friendly) and what is not absent some 
expert help.  I'm definitely interested in the concept and have no great 
faith in utility management of programs of this nature.  Let's pursue.

P.S.  In his own inimitable way, Dan Richard "offered" me the ORA job way 
back when.  I said: "Gee, Dan, I thought we were friends!"   When he acted 
all surprised and hurt in that way of his, I reminded him that Marty Lyons 
and Mark Loy come with the turf.  End of discussion.
