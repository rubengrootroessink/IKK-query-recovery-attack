Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group Members:

The Governor's office has reached out to the Silicon Valley Manufacturing
Group to assist them in understanding the needs and concerns of the business
community.  One very important aspect of the energy issue is that of
conservation.  In an attempt to understand the usage patterns of business
and their efforts towards conservation, the Governor's office asked that we
implement this quick survey.  Please take a moment to answer the following
questions and return to me via e-mail by 4:30 this evening.  By completing
this survey we will help the Governor address our needs.


-Please indicate at what temperature your company has historically kept the
thermostat set.


-Please indicate where your company expects to keep the thermostat set given
the current conditions.




*PLEASE NOTE*
All information received through this survey will remain confidential.  SVMG
continues to protect the interests of its member companies.  This survey in
no way demeans that obligation.  All information provided to any party will
be anonymous.  Thank you for taking the time to complete this survey.  Given
the urgency of the current situation and its constantly changing nature, I
apologize for the short time frame in which to respond.  Any information
will be appreciated.
