Hi, Jeff --

I just had to write to someone who understands how CRAZY the electricity
argument is getting.  Make sure to check out the Union-Tribune's Web site
today to peruse the articles on dereg (www.uniontrib.com).  Jan
Smutney-Jones did a good job responding to Rosenfeld's voter initiative
plan , but the headline and the front page only lead people to believe that
there's no alternative but going back to regulation -- and a state-owned
power authority at that (imagine!).  It would have been very good to have
ARM get a mention as well -- but maybe it isn't ready to be public yet.
When the group does put a stake in the ground, it will have to be sure to
craft its messages in a way that avoids the appearance of reacting to
Rosenfeld rather than being the pro-active and pro-consumer ESP's.

I don't know if it's in your best interest, and I'd like to hear your
thoughts on this, but since the reporters are either being very biased or
not hearing enough from the pro-competition side, would an op-ed from Enron
help calm things down and give people a chance to hear about what positive
benefits a competitive market -- if allowed to exist -- can bring?  I
thought the WSJ article on Monday was great, but few San Diegans read the
Journal and rely on the UT for their news.  However, the editorial pages
are well read and may serve you well.  I can help out your team on drafting
this if you're interested.  Or if there's any other information gathering
you need, just let me know.

Anyway -- hope you had a good Thanksgiving and that you'll be able to come
down here soon.

Have a good Wednesday,

Dana
