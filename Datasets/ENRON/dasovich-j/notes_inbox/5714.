Lexis-Nexis has been a trusted source of real-time and archival information
for 28 years.  Continuing the Lexis-Nexis tradition of providing the most
comprehensive and credible information in the marketplace, the nexis.comSM
Web interface was released to our corporate subscribers in Fall 2000.  To
determine the applicability of this interface for graduate schools of
business, Lexis-Nexis has entered into a pilot program with select leading
business schools.   As a pilot program participant at The University of
California - Berkeley, Haas School of Business, Lexis Nexis has provided
you with unlimited access to its nexis.com service.  All they want in
return is your opinion on how well the nexis.com service meets your
expectations.

To best understand how the nexis.com service meets your needs, Lexis-Nexis
has chosen an independent market research firm, Shugoll Research, to
conduct a research study with pilot program participants like yourself.
This is strictly market research and there is absolutely no sales effort
involved.  The research will be used to identify ways that the nexis.com
service can be improved.

We urge you to participate in this research which will take place on
February 12, 2001.  All qualified participants will receive a cash
honorarium as a token of our appreciation for their time and opinions.  All
of your answers will be kept strictly confidential.

If you are interested in participating, or simply learning more about this
important research, please contact Shugoll Research one of two ways:
