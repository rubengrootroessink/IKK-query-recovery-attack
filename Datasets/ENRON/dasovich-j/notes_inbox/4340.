Dear Silicon Valley Breakfast Club Member:

Please plan to join us for the April meeting of the Silicon Valley Breakfas=

EPRI in their Cafeteria located on their campus at 3412 Hillview Ave in Pal=
o

Building 1.

Our speaker this month is Bob Therkelsen of the California Energy Commissio=

responsible for carrying out the Commission's energy facility siting and
compliance monitoring functions.  Mr. Therkelsen has worked at the Energy
Commission since 1975 as a technical expert, project manager, supervisor,
and manager.  Prior to joining the Energy Commission, he worked as a
wildlife ecologist and environmental consultant.  Mr. Therkelsen has a
Bachelors of Science in Biological Science from the University of Californi=

California at Davis.
Mr. Therkelsen will brief us on the ten generation facilities that have bee=
n
approved during the past 18 months and where each is in the construction
process, and the 14 generation facilities currently working through the CEC
process.  Everyone agrees this new generation is a key part of the long-ter=

generation facilities and how quickly each will come on-line!
