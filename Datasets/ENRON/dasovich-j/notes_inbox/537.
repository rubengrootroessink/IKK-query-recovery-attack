DJ Calif Officials Look Into Merging Cal-ISO And CalPX

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--California state officials are studying the 
possibility of merging the state's Independent System Operator with the 
California Power Exchange.

     The state auditor's office met Monday with the ISO to look into the 
ISO's operations and its relationship with the CalPX, according to documents 
obtained by Dow Jones Newswires.

     The audit was requested by state senator Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, who 
believes a merger between the ISO and the CalPX would make California's 
electricity market more competitive, said Jan Smutny-Jones, chairman of the 
ISO Board of Governors.

     The ISO controls 75% of the state's electricity grid and real-time 
electricity market. The CalPX is the spot market where electricity is bought 
and sold in the state.

     The ISO will meet again with the auditor's office early next week. The 
audit will be complete by spring, said state auditor Mary Noble.
