Rick, Sue and Jeff:   In our effort to communicate news to employees about 
Enron's deregulation efforts and what we're doing in California, Steve Kean 
agreed that we should publish an in-depth story in Enron Business (April 
issue).  I have contacted one of our writers, Don Anderson.  He will call or 
e-mail you in a day or two to set up a convenient interview time.  Rick, 
please give Don the names of other contacts to interview, if needed.

Thanks.

Mary
