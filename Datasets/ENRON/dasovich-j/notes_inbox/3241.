U.S. TRADING SUMMARY

Equities continued where they left off yesterday as all three of
the majors again surged into the green. Better-than-anticipated
earnings from tech giant Hewlett-Packard and networking
powerhouse Ciena helped give the NASDAQ a good shot in the arm
this morning as the tech index gained almost 1.0%. Both the Dow
and S&P 500 also added to the gains made in Wednesday's
blistering session. The combination of still-modest price
inflation, a Federal Reserve that appears willing to continue to
cut interest rates and a sizable amount of cash on the sidelines
has convinced many in the market that equities are ripe for a
bullish move higher.

----------------------------------------------------------------

JAPAN / EUROPE SUMMARY

Europe followed the lead after Wednesday's action in the U.S. as
the major bourses moved higher during their midafternoon trading
session. The French CAC-40 led the indices higher with a 1.0%
gain while the London FTSE stepped-up 0.9%. The German Dax
brought up the rear to rally 0.5%. In Asia, the Nikkei-225 also
looked to the U.S. for direction and dovetailed higher in
somewhat cautious trading ahead of upcoming earnings
announcements from some corporate titans. Technology shares led
to the upside, but trading volume remained relatively low. The
Nikkei-225 ended with a gain of 1.6% while the broad-based Topix
popped 1.5%.

----------------------------------------------------------------

CURRENCY SUMMARY

The U.S. dollar has been trading lower against the yen but higher
against the euro. The greenback continues to suffer from
profit-taking pressures after hitting 124 yen per dollar
yesterday, and has dropped around 1 yen from its recent high to
trade at about 123 yen. As for the common currency, the greenback
has strengthened to the 0.881 dollar per euro level from 0.888
dollars per euro overnight.
