Thanks for the feedback.  I hope you will be able to weigh in at the Tuesday 
meeting of IEP -- the position of IEP will be debated there.  Don't we want 
the trade association to be taking the tough positions for us? Out front and 
in public?

Sue,

Appreciated your stance on the conference call. We can't hide our heads in
the sand at this point, as the governor will not let up and, despite his
political intentions now or later, still enjoys taking shots at ostriches.

Best regards.
