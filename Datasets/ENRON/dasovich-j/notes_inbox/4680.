Elective Scoop Night

You asked for it and your EvMBAA board delivers.  Come hear about electives 
from
the student's point of view.  2-3 of your fellow classmates will share their
experiences with you then answer questions about which electives are best 
suited
for your background or future career goals.

For all of you graduating "3rd years",  please come share your wisdom with the
poor souls that have to make their selections soon. It is never too late to
start giving back to the program (how is that for an alumni pitch?)

Wednesday April 4th (BofA Forum)
Thursday April 5th (C230)
7:30 - 8:15

Some sort of yummy treat for the first 50 people to show up---cross your 
fingers
for ice cream "scoops" :)

Dawn Taketa
Outgoing EvMBAA President
