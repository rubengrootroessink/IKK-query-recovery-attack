From our buddy Jeffrey in Indiana.

Bush's Inaugural Speech
(to the tune of "What a Wonderful World This Will Be" by Sam Cooke)
 
Don't know much about history
Don't know much foreign policy
Don't remember how I got through school
I'm sure I didn't break the rules
But what's it matter 'cause my granny says
"Boy, if you want to you can be the prez
And what a wonderful world this will be"
 
Don't know much about the women's vote
Don't know much about the bill I wrote
Don't know much about the foreign vets
I've never voted for 'em yet
But I do know if your dad tries hard
He can get you in the National Guard
And what a wonderful place that can be
 
Now I never claimed to be an A student
But what's wrong with C's?
And maybe by knowing the names of my cabinet
I can win their love for me
 
Don't know much about air pollution
Don't know much about the constitution
Don't know much about th' economy
It never much affected me
 
But there's one thing that I know for sure
If the rich stay rich and the poor stay poor
What a wonderful world this will be
 
Don't know much about the national debt
I've never had to pay one yet
If we need to we can sell the States
To the Japanese at discount rates
But I do know if things get bad
Dick and I can always call my dad
And what a wonderful world this will be.

Still laughing and praying he never gets to give it!
Jeffrey
