		 Subject: Phone Call From Rod Wright


I received a call from Asm. Rod Wright's office asking for me to provide a
list of the CEOs, a secondary contact, and their phone numbers for all the
California generators and marketers.  As far as his staff knows, Asm. Wright
is going to be calling them personally.  About what, his staff doesn't know.
Jan, on the other hand, had a conversation with Wright today about the
generators' proposals to the utilities for long-term contracts and believes
he is looking for this kind of information.

I already have the CEOs names and addresses.  If the generating companies
and marketers (and I'm assuming he isn't talking about those with only QFs
or renewables) would please provide me a secondary contact and a phone
number as soon as possible, I would appreciate it.
