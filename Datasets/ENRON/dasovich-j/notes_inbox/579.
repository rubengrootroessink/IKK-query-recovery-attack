Subject: WPTF Teleconference Board Meeting on ISO Tariff Amendment 30


Folks,

Enron has requested that we have a Board meeting teleconference on
Thursday, September 28 at 10 a.m. to discuss the ramifications of the
ISO's Tariff Amendment 30.  This amendment allows the ISO to procure
firm energy in the forward market for the purpose of maintaining
reliability.

Enron's interest in this matter is that a party such as WPTF would be
ideal to pose tough questions to the FERC which call to their attention
that the ISO is supposed to be a transmission operator only, and that
granting them the authority to procure energy is a step towards the old
regime of vertically integrated monopolies.

AUDIO ACCESS INFORMATION:
 ==========================
 Toll Number: +1-712-257-2281

 Passcode: 50702
 Conference Leader: Mr Gary Ackerman

 MEETING INFORMATION:
 =====================
 Confirmation Number: 9069003

The FERC filing date, I think, was September 12.  Therefore, I think we
have 30 days to respond.  A quorum of at least six Board members will be
required for the vote, and of that number, 2/3 must approve any motion
the Board adopts.
