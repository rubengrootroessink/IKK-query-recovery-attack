In an effort to assist the IEP member companies in  closing out their fiscal 
year accounts, IEP is attempting to reconcile its  Special Funds accounts 
receivable/accounts payable.? In the IEP Gas  Restructuring Special Fund 
Account, IEP currently has an inbalance of  approximately $35,000.? This 
imbalance stems from work completed during  1999 and the first quarter of 
2000 related to the gas restructuring  proceeding.? You will recall, IEP has 
active in developing an "IEP Vision"  on gas restructuring that was intended 
to move the gas restructuring proceeding  forward.? The Gas Restructuring 
Task Force also  commissioned?Crossborder, Inc. (Tom Beach)?to conduct a 
study of  the?convergence of the gas and electricity markets.? The 
"Convergence  Report"?was circulated to the IEP Gas Restructuring Task Force 
members in  the Spring of 2000.
?
The IEP Gas Restructuring Task Force is comprised  of the following companies:
?
Dynegy??? ???  ??? ??? ??? ???  c/o??? ??? Greg Blue
GWF??? ???  ??? ??? ??? ???  ??? c/o????????Duane  Nelson
UAE??? ???  ??? ??? ??? ???  ??? c/o??? ??? Darrell  Stoval
Williams Energy???  ??? ??? c/o??? ???  Roger Pelote

FPL??????????????????????????????c/o???  ??? Steve Ponder
Enron C&T??? ???  ??? ??? ??? c/o???  ??? Jeff Dasovich
PG&E  Generating??????????c/o????????Bevin  Hong
?
On a pro rata basis, IEP will invoice each of the  companies listed above for 
approximately $4,000 to cover the difference between  commitments received to 
date and actual expenses incurred.? Please contact  me if you have any 
questions or comments.? The invoices are expected to be  in the mail by the 
end of next week.?
