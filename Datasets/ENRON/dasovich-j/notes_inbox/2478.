Hi -- I've drafted an op ed piece that could go this week while the papers 
are discussing Cal-ISO/FERC's latest move in California. I haven't discussed 
this with Jim, but either Karen or I could suggest it if the piece is strong.

Karen, I went with the interpretation that Enron doesn't want to see retail 
price freezes lifted because that would discourage utilities from buying 
long-term power or structured products from us. 

Jeff, as always, I could use your help in making sure I've made the right 
interpretations and that I've included all the important points.

Karen -- one more thing. I think we could take the first 2 paragraphs of this 
piece and add a third graf quickly explaining Enron's position (soft caps are 
a good first step, but we gotta eliminate them entirely) and run this as an 
eBiz if you'd like.

Please let me know your thoughts.
