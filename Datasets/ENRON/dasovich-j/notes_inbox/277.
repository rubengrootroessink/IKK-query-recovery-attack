Paul and Lysa:

I want to apologize in advance.  It now seems that FERC has realized that it 
has a biz meeting in D.C. on the 13th, which makes having a meeting in San 
Diego on the 12th somewhat difficult.  So, if FERC changes the date (again) 
and pushes the meeting back, I'll go to S.D. on the 11th to see Steve Kean 
testify and fly to D.C. on the evening of the 11th or morning of the 12th and 
attend Paul's meeting in person.  If they don't change the date and it stays 
on the 12th, I won't go to D.C. and will participate in Paul's meeting on the 
12th in D.C. by phone.  I'll let you know what FERC decides, when it decides 
it.

Exasperatedly yours,
Jeff
