I have asked John Klauberg  of LeBoeuf Lamb to look at the letter.  Are we 
using Bracewell on matters relating to the PX? I do not know  who Ron Carroll 
is.

Vicki:

Do we need to add the PX letter to the agenda for tomorrow's 10 AM call?  If 
so, make sense to have Bracewell (Ron Carroll?) and Mike Day on as well?
