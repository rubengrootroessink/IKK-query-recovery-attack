California Blame Game Yields No Score

Probes Reveal Little Evidence Suppliers Acted Illegally


By John R. Emshwiller





05/22/2001


The Wall Street Journal





While the energy suppliers are generating "unconscionable profits," the
question remains "whether they are illegal profits," says California
Attorney General Bill Lockyer, who has offered rewards of as much as
hundreds of millions of dollars for information about lawbreaking in the
energy business.


Mr. Lockyer says he believes his office will eventually file civil charges
against suppliers. He would very much like to add criminal counts. "I would
love to personally escort [Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth] Lay to an 8 x 10
cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says `Hi my name is
Spike, honey,'" adds Mr. Lockyer. Houston-based Enron is a major
energy-trading company. Like other such firms, Enron has denied wrongdoing
in the California market.


Mark Palmer, Enron's vice president for corporate communications, said Mr.
Lockyer's comment about Mr. Lay "is so counterproductive that it doesn't
merit a response."
