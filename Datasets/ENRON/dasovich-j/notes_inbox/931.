DSTAR:  The Board meeting is being held today and tomorrow.  The board 
consultants have been working with the six IOU's to submit a joint filing on 
the 16th that will consist of a letter and supplemental summaries of each 
proposal.  They are not asking for approval or submitting tariff language but 
simply providing a status report.  The consultants indicated that they are 
also including a list of unresolved issues which turned out to be a fairly 
contentious topic as they are not including a majority of the SWPTF 
comments.  Our position was to include all issues or none at all.  The 
consultants are holding meetings next Wed-Friday to discuss the issues and 
prepare for a Board briefing on October 30 where all parties will have an 
opportunity to be heard.  The Board hopes to make final decisions on the 
outstanding issues at the November meeting in order to have a tariff filed by 
the December deadline.

AISA:  Filed an answer in response to the Arizona Irrigation Districts Motion 
to Reject the AISAA Filing and other motions to intervene.  The AISA 
successfully lambasted the irrigation districts citing their substantial 
participation in the process and questioning their motive in what is 
exclusively a retail access initiative.  The irrigation districts are 
exclusively wholesale and are in fact not even wholesale transmission 
customers of any AISA participating transmission provider.  The filing also 
requests the FERC to separate approval of Phase I and Phase II features as 
the limited concerns raised by the few portesters were focused on Phase II 
features of the protocols manual.  AISA requests FERC act on Phase I so the 
marketplace can immediately take advantage of the pro competitive benefits 
associated with Phase I and in particular the temporary transmission rights 
allocation and the fast track ADR process.  This request includes a 
stipulation that if the FERC decide to act in Phases, that it act on Phase II 
features no later than April 15, 2001.  ** The filing also addresses Judge 
Campbell's minute entry on the Retail Electric Competition Rules and 
interprets the fair value determination to be associated with retail sales by 
ESPs and NOT FERC-jurisdictional services.

WIO:  NRTA has confirmed that they do not intend to merge with the other 
entities into the WIO but will support its formation.  They may have certain 
requirements if they wish to be a steering committee member, however.
