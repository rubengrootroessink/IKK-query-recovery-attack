> I ran into Steve Weissman, the Commission's new Energy Re-Restructuring

> have been the first time "Harvey Morris" and "moderate" have been used in
> the same sentence).  Also there will be a presentation on the Project
> Reclaim air emissions credit program.  So the idea is to get information
> on the three main reasons that have been cited to explain the electricity
> prices this summer.  All this is primarily a preface for the Legislative
> Committee hearings to be held in San Diego on Monday, and FERC
> investigative hearings to be held on Tuesday.  The schedule, topics, and
> participants for Friday's hearings are still somewhat up in the air, but
> this information was current as of about 1 p.m. this afternoon.  After
> this flurry of activity, Steve expects and hopes that things will quiet
