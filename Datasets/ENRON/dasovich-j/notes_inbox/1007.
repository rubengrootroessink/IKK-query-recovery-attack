Attached is a summary of AL 2041-E, filed yesterday by PG&E.? It  submits for 
Commission approval PG&E's proposed?reasonableness  standards for 
bilateral?purchases of energy, ancillary services and  capacity products. 
?
However, the standards are redacted and a protective order is  requested.? In 
other words, we have no way of providing any intelligent  comments on the 
standards, although we could protest the process by which they  are being 
developed.? Note that PG&E requests a shortened response time  of only 14 
days for comments or protests.
?
The advice letter and attachment are attached for your information.?  Please 
let me know your thoughts.
?
