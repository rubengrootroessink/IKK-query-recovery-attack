Angie,

Please add Jeff Dasovich and Mike Dahlke to the e-mail distribution list for 
these meetings.  Thanks!

Jeff and Mike,

I apologize for not forwarding this information in time as I was in DC until 
now and did not have access to this information.  I have 2 laptops and 
happened to have the other one with me.  I hope you were both able to make 
the call somehow.  

Regards,

Lara
