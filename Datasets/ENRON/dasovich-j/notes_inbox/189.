I did not hear about the announcement - please send!!

C1 is doing a demo integration with us.  We are having a hard time getting a
booth at their conference, but at least we will be able to announce a loose
partnership with them.

We meet with Ariba tomorrow.

How was the dome?  San Diego was beautiful!
