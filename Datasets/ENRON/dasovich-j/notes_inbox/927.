Sue,

I left you a voice mail on the www.ChooseEnron.com project.  Mona (through 
legal) has reviewed the site.

The purpose of the site is to provide commercial customers within certain 
industries (restaurants, hotels, motels, hospitals, nursing homes, grocery 
stores, convenience stores) the opportunity to purchase power from Enron.  At 
this time, this isn't truly an "online" purchase.

The customer is sent a mailer directing them to the site and providing them a 
unique customer ID and password.  When they arrive at the site, they will be 
asked to enter customer contact information and basic energy usage 
information for up to 5 meters and/or up to 2,000,000 kWh of aggregate 
usage.  (The minimum usage size corresponds to the 20 kW per meter peak 
demand.)  When the customer requests a price, the site is currently 
configured to pull the price from the executable pricing matrix and fill-in a 
contract.  The contract is then emailed to the customer within minutes (at 
worst within 4 hours when the system is extremely busy).  The customer must 
physically sign the contract and fax that back to Enron.  At that time, the 
customer goes into the normal set -up and billing process.

The site is available 24 hours/day and 7 days/week unless the power desk 
shuts it down during times when the desk is reaching it's open position 
limits.

I've reserved several customer IDs for you.  Those are:

The password for each of these user IDs is "begin".

Keep in mind, we've set this up to protect ourselves against arbitrage risk.  
If you enter a request for a price quote(s) under a particular user ID, you 
cannot log in under that ID again until those quotes have expired (5PM CST 
the next business day).  That's why I've given you so many user IDs.

I hope you'll have a chance to look at the site.  Please let me know if you 
have any questions or comments.
