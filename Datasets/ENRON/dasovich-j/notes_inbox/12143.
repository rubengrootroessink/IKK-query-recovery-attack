It's worth going to this site just to "flip the switch" and see the redacted 
portions appear before your very eyes!

Ken Smith just called my attention to the following.  See this link for all 
formerly censored language from the DWR contracts:

http://www.sco.ca.gov/power_page/contract_info.htm

Also, see the summary link.

Finally, below is an interesting article about the real cost of the contracts.

      Connell: Power cost twice Davis' figure  July 6, 2001  By JOHN HOWARD 
The Orange County Register  SACRAMENTO -- The average cost of electricity 
purchased under $43 billion of worth of state contracts is actually more than 
double the amount reported by Gov. Gray Davis' administration, state 
Controller Kathleen Connell said Thursday.  Connell said her staff's analysis 
put the per-megawatt average at $170, compared with $69 to $79 estimated by 
Davis.  Connell stopped short of suggesting that the higher cost could drive 
another increase in rates, although consumer groups said the higher amount 
likely would require some future increase.  The controller, who writes the 
state's checks, said her figures assume fixed prices for natural gas over the 
duration of the contracts, which range from a few months to 20 years.  The 
administration, noting that nearly half its contracts are pegged to the 
fluctuating market price of natural gas, said costs on many of the contracts 
would decline over time.  Consumer groups were skeptical of the 
administration's numbers.  "You could cut these numbers in various ways and 
make different averages, long-range or short-range contracts, peak power or 
nonpeak, and probably either average could be defended mathematically," said 
Nettie Hoge of The Utility Reform Network. "We can't tell you whether it's 
$69 or $170 - the contracts are very convoluted and complex."
