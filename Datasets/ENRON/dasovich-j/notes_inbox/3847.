Dear Silicon Valley Leader:

Once again, we are inviting you to Silicon Valley's second Regional Energy
Summit, co-hosted by the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group, the City of San
Jose and the County Board of Supervisors, to develop quantifiable, near-term
solutions to avoid rolling black-outs, by emphasizing

  --conservation
  --shifting load during peak periods
  --immediate generation
  --sound public policies

Details are as follows:

Date:    Friday, May 4, 2001
Time:  8 a.m. (sharp) until 12:00  Noon
Location: Synopsys
  455 North Mary Avenue, Building 2
  Sunnyvale, California

The summit is free and open to the public.  But, due to limited space,
RESERVATIONS ARE MANDATORY.  Please confirm your attendance no later than
Wednesday, May 2 by 5:00 p.m., by phoning the Manufacturing Group Office at
408/501-7864 or by simply responding to this email.

If you have already made a reservation, there is no need to do so again.  We
look forward to having you join us for this community-wide, public and
private sector summit to develop short-term solutions to our Valley and
State's energy crisis.  Please come prepared to participate.

Sincerely,

Carl Guardino
