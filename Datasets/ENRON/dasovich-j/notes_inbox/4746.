If possible, it would be helpful to get your take on what happened to a 
larger audience.   Afetr a few weeks of optimism, it appears to be changing.

The California Assembly failed to pass AB8 last night in a 48-24 vote 
(two-thirds are needed to pass emergency legislation).  Assembly Republicans 
opposed the bill criticizing the state's spending on electricity.  The 
Assembly may vote on it again today or over the weekend.  Assembly Speaker 
Robert Hertzberg canceled his trip to DC and will work with the group today 
or over the weekend.
