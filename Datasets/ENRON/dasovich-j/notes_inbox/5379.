Good morning.  One of my contacts at RGA sent me a copy of a letter that went 
to DOE Secretary Abraham this week, thanking him for his participation in the 
WGA conference in Portland.  It stated, in part :

 "We now believe it is imperative, given the importance of encouraging the 
development of and investment in new plant construction, that you NOTextend 
the Department of Energy orders requiring the sale of electricity and natural 
gas, and a cap on those prices."

The general tone of the overall letter was that they want Davis to continue 
fixing his own problem.   The letter was copied to Dick Cheney and Chairman 
Hebert.  I'll send a copy along via fax later today.  The signing Governors 
were:  Hull, Owens, Kempthorne, Martz, Guinn, Gary Johnson, Leavitt, 
Geringer--all republicans.
