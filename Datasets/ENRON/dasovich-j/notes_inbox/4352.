Subject: Reliant Negawatt proposal

I have attached a proposal prepared by Reliant.  Reliant hopes that it is 
something that Enron can support (with any modifications).  Steve Walton has 
concerns about the role of the WSCC.  ELCON supports the concept with some 
other modifications.  I recognise that there are issues. Nonetheless, to 
respond to Barton's short term emergency measures, it would be usefule to 
know whther a negawatt program across the WSCC can be im[plemented by June.
