Jeff,
Does Enron support this bill?  What would it mean to Enron... to 
Transwestern?   I don't recall seeing what he was proposing.


Barton to Release CA Emergency Bill Today 
Rep. Joe Barton (R-TX) plans to release to the public today his emergency 
legislation that seeks to provide relief to the troubled California wholesale 
energy markets in the short term. 
But the bill isn't expected to be formally introduced on the House floor 
until probably sometime later this week. The House Energy and Air Quality 
Subcommittee, of which Barton is chairman, has scheduled its first hearing on 
the measure for next Tuesday. 
There have been some changes made to the legislation, but "it's not 
monumentally different" from the draft, said Barton spokeswoman Samantha 
Jordan. It was not immediately known whether a key provision that would 
require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to undertake an 
investigation into wholesale power rates in the western markets remained in 
the bill.
