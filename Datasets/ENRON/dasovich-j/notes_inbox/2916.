In todays' MW Daily, there is a summary of the view taken by Republicans on 
how the utilities could start paying off back debts.  They say that the debts 
could be (partially) be paid off "within the parameters of the existing rate 
structure".

Do we have any info on what they're thinking - in this regard?

I'd like to incorporate any such info into our forward tariff curve as soon 
as I can.
