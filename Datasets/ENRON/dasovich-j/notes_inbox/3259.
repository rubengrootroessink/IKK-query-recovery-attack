Internet Daily for Wednesday, May 16, 2001

Sony teaming with RealNetworks

Sony said Wednesday its PlayStation 2 video-game system will be
able to access streaming audio and video over the Internet
through the inclusion of software supplied by RealNetworks .
Under the deal, the parties envision video-game programmers
making use of bundled RealPlayer 8 software to include video
clips and studios shipping online movie previews. Sony plans to
offer a hard drive for the upgraded game system to store video
and music. Sony also said current PlayStation game console owners
will be able to upgrade their units to enable digital downloads.
The RealNetworks deal comes a day after Sony and AOL Time Warner
said the Internet-connected device would permit users to gain
access to AOL's Instant Messenger and e-mail.

MusicNet service demo set

The chairman of RealNetworks is expected to make the first public
demonstration of the company's music subscription service on
Thursday, The Wall Street Journal reported. MusicNet's debut will
take place on Capitol Hill in Washington, where Chairman Rob
Glaser is scheduled to testify at a House Judiciary subcommittee
hearing involving music on the Internet. The session will be
Webcast.

David vs. Goliaths

IBM has selected Norway's Opera Software to provide the Web
browser for its Linux-based NetVista Internet appliances.
"Signing with IBM is a major breakthrough," said Jon S. von
Tetzchner, chief executive of the Oslo-based company. "This
announcement is the first in a series that will show that Opera
has taken the lead in the Internet appliance market." The
announcement may be significant for both AOL Time Warner and
Microsoft, whose browsers were not selected. The deal "is
certainly something that the AOL folks would have liked to have,"
David Smith, an analyst with research firm Gartner Group, told
CNet News. "It sounds like Opera is muscling in."

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Online sales rise

Total spending on online sales increased from $3.5 billion in
March to $4.3 billion in April, according to a monthly survey
reported by Forrester Research, which said the number of
households shopping online stood at 15.6 million last month.
Consumers spent an average of $273 per person in April, compared
with $263 in March. Furniture and small-appliance category sales
rose by almost 250% from March levels, while sporting goods,
major appliances, toys and video games showed the biggest
declines.

Yahoo puts sex chats in back room

Yahoo has made it more difficult for Web visitors to find its
sexually explicit chat rooms and clubs. A spokesman for Yahoo
denied a claim by some that the entire adult section had been
removed. Thousands of users have signed a petition protesting the
move by the company, according to The New York Times. "We haven't
made a decision one way or another," spokesman Jackson Holtz told
the Times. "This is an evaluation process," he said. About a
month ago, Yahoo backed away from agreements with sellers of
X-rated videos and adult-oriented products.
