Drew/Steve/Tony:

I've talked to Dan and he's available to represent Steve during his testimony 
on Wednesday.  Few things:

Dan's an excellent regulatory lawyer.
Dan worked for many years at SoCalGas before going into private practice.
Drew, I'll leave to you and Dan to work out the details of any contract for 
Dan's services.
Dan will need immediately:
A copy of Steve's testimony.
A copy of the PUC Rulemaking, etc. calling for testimony.
Any information on the list of parties who have indicated that they will 
cross Steve and for how long, and any testimony filed by those parties.
In addition, I would recommend strongly that Dan and Steve (at a minimum) get 
on the phone and discuss Steve's testimony tomorrow, and plan to meet prior 
to the hearing on Wednesday.  If you'd like me to participate in a call 
tomorrow, just let me know.


If there's anything else I can do, just let me know.

Best,
Jeff
