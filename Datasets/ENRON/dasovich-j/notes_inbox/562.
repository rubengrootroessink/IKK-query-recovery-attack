	Don't Miss This Great Opportunity!!!! 
	
	Over the next few days, the Haas School of Business Investment Club (HSBIC) 
will be placing in your mailbox an investment form which you can use to be a 
part of the HSBIC Investment Fund. Since its inception in February of 1996 
through August 2000, HSBIC has returned it investors a compound annual return 
of roughly 18.3%!!!! 
	
	
	
	And not only will you have this investment opportunity, you will be providing 
fellow classmates with an invaluable opportunity to research stocks and learn 
fund management skills.? Unlike tution and other demands Haas makes on your 
money, this is one case where the money remains yours, we are just managing 
it for you. Twice a year you will have the opportunity to withdrawal your 
money from the fund. But while your money is invested, you are not only 
sharing the investment performance of the fund, you are showing your support 
and belief in the students at Haas. 
	
	
	So, you ask, there must be some sort of minimum investment, but how much for 
such a great cause that helps students and puts your own money to work for 
you at the same time.  
	
	
	One may expect to require $10k, but during our limited semiannual enrollment 
window, we not requesting $10K 
	
	
	
	not $5K 
	
	
	
	not even $1K 
	
	
	
	An initial investment of $250 is all we require!!!! Of course, most of you 
will want to invest more?(the average invstment is $1700) and its nice to 
know there is no maximum investment cap. 
	
	
	
	Either way, DON'T let this opportunity pass you by. LOOK in your mailbox for 
enrollment information, fill out the form and return it, along with a check 
made out to 'Haas School of Business Investment Club', to my mail box. 
	
	
	
	And should you have any questions about the fund, have some great stock picks 
or would like to get involved in the club, please feel free to give me a 
call. 
	
	
	
	Thanks for your support,
