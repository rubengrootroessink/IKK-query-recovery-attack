to join us for the October 7 dinner cause I honestly am ordering the foie

Greetings (or Hola!): 

Talked to Jeff Green.? He said he'd do the road, but can't do it with the 
wood that's in the driveway.? Eldon, are you and Bob planning to go up this
week?? If so, any chance of getting the wood moved?? Otherwise, going to be 
tough to do the road.? Jeff starts on my road on Wednesday and I'll be 
going up this weekend to monitor (and start organizing some of the chopped 
up wood that's lying around the yard at the dome. 

Welcome back.? Hope you had a good time in Mexico. 

Best, 
Jeff
