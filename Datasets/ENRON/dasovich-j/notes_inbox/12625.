Creditors? They could, as one consumer advocate says, "cannibalize" each=20

Jesse Fried, a bankruptcy law professor at the University of California,=20
Berkeley. "It looks like they're just going to have to sit down and decide=

Fried says the "right answer" should be PG&E Corp., which requested=20

To force the corporation to repay the money, says Sacramento bankruptcy=20

Rosenfield predicts it will remain off limits because, he says, the state=

Dan Walters: Record undercuts governor's message on handling energy crisis


(Published June 11, 2001)=20
Gov. Gray Davis spoke to a small business conference in Sacramento on May 3=
0=20
and reminded attendees that "I'm a pro-business Democrat." He then launched=
=20
into a recitation of his standard pitch on the state's energy crisis -- tha=
t=20
it's being caused by "greedy energy companies" and that he's working hard t=
o=20
solve it with far-reaching conservation programs and a massive power plant=
=20
construction program.=20
"For 12 years, California did not build one major power plant," he said,=20
adding that since he became governor, 15 have been approved, 10 are under=
=20
construction, and by 2003 "we will have more capacity than demand."=20
Davis is a politician who's renowned for staying, in the jargon of politica=
l=20
consultants, "on message." And what he told the business conference about=
=20
building power plants replicated what he had said dozens of times in=20
preceding weeks. During his April 5 televised speech on the crisis, for=20
example, Davis claimed, "In the 12 years before I took office, not a single=
=20
major power plant was built in California. Not one."=20
Clearly, Davis' message to Californians is that the state wasn't building=
=20
power plants before he began his governorship in January 1999, but that he =
is=20
moving, as he often says, "at warp speed" to license and build new plants a=
nd=20
close the supply-demand gap. There are two things wrong with that message:=
=20
His account of the pre-Davis record is not accurate, and his assertion that=
=20
huge amounts of new power generation are coming soon is, to say the least,=
=20
questionable.=20
First, the past. In the 12 years prior to his becoming governor, the=20
California Energy Commission licensed 17 power plants with a generating=20
capacity of about 1,900 megawatts. Twenty-one plants totaling 3,100 megawat=
ts=20
began producing power during the period, including two considered "major" b=
y=20
the usual definition of being 300 megawatts or more: the 300-megawatt=20
Sycamore plant in Kern County and the 385-megawatt Watson cogeneration plan=
t=20
in Los Angeles County. Two more plants that started production during the=
=20
period were more than 200 megawatts.=20
After Davis became governor, but while the Energy Commission was still=20
controlled by appointees of his predecessor, Pete Wilson, the commission=20
licensed an additional 5,800 megawatts of generation, including nine major=
=20
plants.=20
Plant licensing has been speeded up in the last six months, but the total o=
f=20
plants licensed by the Davis-controlled commission is less than 4,000=20
megawatts and none of those facilities has gone into production.=20
New plants are under construction, according to progress reports prepared b=
y=20
the Energy Commission, but wheth- er all the recently licensed facilities=
=20
will be built, at least in the near future, is questionable. There is, powe=
r=20
industry sources say, an increasing reluctance by energy companies to commi=
t=20
hundreds of millions of dollars to con- struct licensed plants (about=20
$750,000 per megawatt for new facilities) while Davis continues to denounce=
=20
them as greedy exploiters and hints he may seize plants under an emergency=
=20
declaration. Another factor is uncertainty over whether the state or=20
utilities will be financially able to buy the power.=20
One hint of that attitude has already surfaced publicly. Mirant Corp.=20
announced June 1 that it was delaying construction of a 530-megawatt=20
expansion of its Contra Costa County generation complex "because of=20
uncertainty about California energy market rules." Randy Harrison, head of=
=20
Mirant's Western operations, said, "We have to be able to determine that th=
is=20
will be a viable investment before we can put a quarter of a billion dollar=
s'=20
worth of steel on the ground."=20
Work on much smaller cogeneration and "peaker" plants has begun, but many o=
f=20
the big ones apparently are being put on hold. Indeed, there's a secondary=
=20
market developing for selling licensed projects that could be built in the=
=20
future. Energy executives may be greedy, but they're not stupid and it woul=
d=20
be foolhardy to make multimillion-dollar commitments in a state that still=
=20
doesn't know where it's going in energy policy.=20

State program in effect when reserves are low

SACRAMENTO -- Gov. Gray Davis signed an executive order yesterday creating =
a=20
voluntary program that will use up to $100 million in state money to pay=20
businesses not to use electricity when reserves are low.=20
Davis said that since nearly 70 percent of energy use in California is by=
=20
commercial users, the program will "help mitigate and even avoid blackouts.=
"=20
Participants, mostly large commercial users, will submit bids for reducing=
=20
their power. Grid operators will then compare those prices with the going=

price for power and choose the cheapest option, said S. David Freeman, the=
=20
governor's senior energy adviser.=20
"We'd rather pay people in California to cut back than pay out-of-state=20
generators," he said.=20
The Independent System Operator, manager of the state's power grid, will=20

it=20
financially.=20
The program is the first of its kind paid for by the state. The Public=20
Utilities Commission, the Independent System Operator, and the state's=20
utilities have similar programs.=20
Kellan Fluckiger, Davis' energy adviser, said the size of the new program=

would depend on how many participants the ISO can recruit.=20
The ISO releases information on bids for energy after a period of time, and=

will probably treat bids for cutting power the same way, he said.=20







Sempra may drop project in Escondido=20



Dispute over power plant threatens industrial park
By Jonathan Heller=20
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER=20
June 9, 2001=20
ESCONDIDO -- Officials of Sempra Energy Resources are considering pulling t=
he=20
plug on a planned high-tech industrial park in the city because of conflict=
s=20
with a small power plant that would be built near the park's entrance.=20
Sempra executives will meet Monday to discuss the issue, a source familiar=
=20
with the project said late yesterday. If they decide to cancel plans for th=
e=20
business park, Sempra still would move forward with its 500-megawatt plant =
on=20
the site in southwest Escondido, the source said. The 200-acre industrial=
=20
park was supposed to be built around the power plant, in the Quail Hills ar=
ea=20
of the city.=20
Without the park, Sempra would not have to go through the city's permit=20
process, since the power plant would fall under the jurisdiction of the=20
California Energy Commission. If that happened, the city would have lost no=
t=20
only the industrial park, but also the opportunity to have any say over the=
=20
Sempra project, such as setting conditions on it or requiring environmental=
=20
reviews.=20
Sempra's concern stems from a 49-megawatt plant that would be built at the=
=20
entrance to its business park by a company called CalPeak. The city no long=
er=20
has any say about that plant, however.=20
CalPeak, impatient with the city's permit process, opted to bypass the city=
=20
and go through a new expedited 21-day approval process with the state Energ=
y=20
Commission, which approved the plant this week. That angered some city=20
officials, who said their land-use authority had been usurped.=20
Sempra wanted the commission to require that the CalPeak plant be shut down=
=20
in about two years, when its business park was ready to be marketed to=20
prospective tenants, the source said. The commission did not incorporate th=
at=20
provision in its approval.=20
Officials from Sempra and some city officials fear the CalPeak plant would=
=20
not fit the upscale image envisioned for the park, and could hinder its=20
ability to attract high-end tenants.=20
On Wednesday, the City Council met in closed session to consider a court=20
challenge to the Energy Commission's approval of the CalPeak project, City=
=20
Attorney Jeffrey Epp said yesterday. "As of now I don't have any direction =
to=20
pursue litigation," Epp said.=20
Two city officials who asked not to be named said council members June Rady=
=20
and Tom D'Agosta voted in favor of suing to block the plant. Ed Gallo, Mari=
e=20
Waldron and Mayor Lori Holt Pfeiler stayed silent. The lack of a majority=
=20
meant litigation could not move forward.=20
Sempra officials in charge of developing the industrial park and power plan=
t=20
could not be reached for comment yesterday. But the source familiar with th=
e=20
project said they were disappointed that the City Council decided not to=20
challenge the CalPeak plant in court.=20
The commission did approve several city suggestions regarding landscaping f=
or=20
the CalPeak plant, and placing power lines underground, to help shield it=
=20
from the business park. But Sempra officials are not convinced that's enoug=
h.=20
"The city has basically decided to do nothing," the source said. "Obviously=
=20
that will hurt marketing efforts at the business park."=20
Pfeiler said late yesterday she was not aware of Sempra's request to the=20
commission to have the CalPeak plant shut down in two years.=20
"As far as I'm concerned the conditions Sempra and the city asked for were=
=20
met," Pfeiler said. "So Sempra should be ready to go full speed ahead on th=
e=20
industrial park. For Sempra to even think about not building the industrial=
=20
park is very frustrating to the community."=20
City officials desperately want the business park to be built. They see the=

Hackers Victimize Cal-ISO=20

By DAN MORAIN, Times Staff Writer=20

?????SACRAMENTO--For at least 17 days at the height of the energy crisis,=
=20
hackers mounted an attack on a computer system that is integral to the=20
movement of electricity throughout California, a confidential report obtain=
ed=20
by The Times shows.
?????The hackers' success, though apparently limited, brought to light laps=
es=20
in computer security at the target of the cyber-attack, the California=20
Independent System Operator, which oversees most of the state's massive=20
electricity transmission grid.
?????Officials at Cal-ISO say that the lapses have been corrected and that=
=20
there was no threat to the grid. But others familiar with the attack say=20
hackers came close to gaining access to key parts of the system, and could=
=20
have seriously disrupted the movement of electricity across the state.
?????Democratic and Republican lawmakers were angered by the security breac=
h=20
at an entity that is such a basic part of California's power system, given=
=20
its fragility during the state's continuing energy crisis. One called the=
=20
attack "ominous."
?????An internal agency report, stamped "restricted," shows that the attack=
=20
began as early as April 25 and was not detected until May 11. The report sa=
ys=20
the main attack was routed through China Telecom from someone in Guangdong=
=20
province in China.
?????In addition to using China Telecom, hackers entered the system by usin=
g=20
Internet servers based in Santa Clara in Northern California and Tulsa,=20
Okla., the report says. James Sample, the computer security specialist at=
=20
Cal-ISO who wrote the report, said he could not tell for certain where the=
=20
attackers were located.
?????"You don't know where people are really from," Sample said. "The only=
=20
reason China stuck out is because of the recent political agenda China had=
=20
with the U.S. . . . An ambitious U.S. hacker could have posed as a Chinese=
=20
hacker."
?????The breach occurred amid heightened Sino-American tensions after the=
=20
collision between a Chinese military jet and a U.S. spy plane. In early May=
,=20
there were hundreds of publicly reported computer attacks apparently=20
originating from China. Most of those incidents involved mischief;=20
anti-American slogans were scrawled on government Web sites.
?????The attack on the Cal-ISO computer system apparently had the potential=
=20
for more serious consequences, given that the hackers managed to worm their=
=20
way into the computers at the agency's headquarters in Folsom, east of=20
Sacramento, that were linked to a system that controls the flow of=20
electricity across California. The state system is tied into the transmissi=
on=20
grid for the Western United States.
?????"This was very close to being a catastrophic breach," said a source=20
familiar with the attack and CalISO's internal investigation of the inciden=
t.
?????On May 7 and 8, as the infiltration was occurring, California suffered=
=20
widespread rolling blackouts, but Cal-ISO officials said Friday that there=
=20
was no connection between the hacking and the outages, which affected more=
=20
than 400,000 utility customers.
?????"It did not affect markets or reliability," said Stephanie McCorkle, a=
=20
spokeswoman for Cal-ISO.
?????Officials of the agency made no public acknowledgment of the attack=20
until Friday when contacted by The Times. The agency did, however, call the=
=20
FBI, which is investigating.
?????McCorkle said Cal-ISO did not make a public disclosure about the hacki=
ng=20
"because it didn't impact the reliability of any of our internal networks."
?????"It didn't have a negative consequence and would not have impacted the=
=20
public or market participants," McCorkle said.
?????After the attack was discovered, the report says, investigators found=
=20
evidence that the hackers apparently were trying to "compile" or write=20
software that might have allowed them to get past so-called firewalls=20
protecting far more sensitive parts of the computer system.
?????The attackers focused on parts of the grid agency's computer system th=
at=20
are under development. In what may have been the most significant lapse, th=
e=20
system being developed was not behind a firewall, a security element design=
ed=20
to keep out those who are not entitled to access.
?????Additionally, so-called tripwires that might have alerted agency=20
security personnel to the unauthorized entry were nonexistent. Nor were the=
re=20
logs within the system that might have identified users entering the system=
=20
as the infiltration was occurring, the report notes.
?????What's more, dozens of ports into the computer system were open, when=
=20
only a handful should have been available.
?????"All servers should be hardened regardless of their role or location i=
n=20
the network," the report says. "Only ports that are required to be open=20
should be opened; all others should be disabled."
?????Complicating the investigation, workers at Cal-ISO rebooted their=20
computers when the machines balked, apparently in response to the=20
infiltration.
?????"This action limited our ability to discover all files and activity th=
at=20
may be related to this compromise," the report says.
?????Sample, the security engineer who wrote the report, downplayed the=20
potential threat and said the attack was "something that we've been=20
anticipating."
?????"It was a compromise, not really an attack," he said.
?????State legislators were not comforted by such distinctions.
?????"That's really amazing on two counts: that there were computers not=20
behind a firewall and it took 17 days to discover," said state Sen. Debra=
=20

Drop in Gas Price Raises Questions in Probe=20
Regulation: Cost has fallen 96% since May 31, stirring accusations of an=20
artificial shortage.=20

By RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR, Times Staff Writer=20

?????WASHINGTON--As the price of natural gas destined for California power=
=20
plants continued to collapse Friday, new questions were being raised about =
a=20
controversial shipping deal between two offshoots of a Texas energy=20
conglomerate.
?????State officials and utilities have complained to the Federal Energy=20
Regulatory Commission that subsidiaries of Houston-based El Paso Corp.=20
restricted gas supplies on a major pipeline system last year, creating an=
=20
artificial shortage that sent energy costs soaring. The company has=20
steadfastly denied the allegations, which are the focus of a trial-like=20
hearing stretching into its fifth week at FERC.
?????But in a development that had the courtroom abuzz Friday, the markup f=
or=20
natural gas shipped from producing basins in Texas to the Southern Californ=
ia=20
border has plunged by 96% since May 31, when the contract between the El Pa=
so=20
subsidiaries expired and about 30 competitors entered the market.
?????According to data from Natural Gas Week, the markup between Texas and =
a=20
major California-border pipeline junction served by El Paso fell from $6.32=
=20
per million British thermal units on May 31--the last day of the=20
controversial deal--to only 23 cents Friday. A million BTU is about what a=
=20
typical Southern California household consumes in five or six days.
?????That put Southern California natural gas prices in line with the rest =
of=20
the country for the first time since last July.=20
?????State officials and California utilities said the price collapse=20
bolstered their case that the El Paso companies had been exercising market=
=20
power--engaging in monopolistic behavior.
?????"You can't help but think that the market is reacting to the differenc=
e=20
between having many shippers instead of one," said Kevin Lipson, a lawyer=
=20
representing Southern California Edison in the proceedings against El Paso.=
=20
"The market knows the difference between competition and monopoly."
?????Under the deal that just expired, one subsidiary of El Paso had obtain=
ed=20
the shipping rights for up to 17% of California's daily gas consumption=20
through a pipeline system owned by another subsidiary.
?????"We don't have an 800-pound gorilla any more," said Harvey Morris, a=
=20
lawyer for the California Public Utilities Commission. "We have a chimpanze=
e."
?????But Peggy Heeg, deputy general counsel for El Paso Corp., said other=
=20
factors--such as mild weather and increased storage levels of gas in=20
California--are behind the dramatic price swing.
?????"We are glad to see prices coming down and to see some relief for=20
Californians," Heeg said. "The price movement is consistent with what we ar=
e=20
saying, which is that supply and demand are driving prices."
?????The swift reversal in prices has raised suspicions at FERC.
?????"It's not enough to convict El Paso and send them to jail, but this=20
piece of information is certainly consistent with the idea that there was=
=20
market power," said an agency official.
?????"Prices had been dropping a little, but since June 1, it's become very=
=20
noticeable," said another agency official. "Obviously, one of the reasons h=
as=20
to be that the capacity changed hands."
?????FERC's governing board can order El Paso to refund profits if it finds=
=20
that the subsidiaries tried to manipulate the California market.
?????One independent economist cautioned against a rush to judgment. "There=
=20
are a lot of things going on which in and of themselves could account for a=
=20
significant price decline," said Bruce Henning of Energy and Environmental=
=20
Analysis Inc. in Arlington, Va. "I would be unwilling to draw a causal link=
."
?????In addition to the weather and fuller storage cited by El Paso's Heeg,=
=20
increased conservation by Californians has reduced demand for electricity.=
=20
That, in turn, has dampened the market for natural gas, the fuel most=20
commonly used by the state's power plants.
?????But the industry also has come under strong political pressure in rece=
nt=20
weeks. In hearings before Congress and the California Legislature, lawmaker=
s=20
spoke out against natural gas prices that were much higher than elsewhere i=
n=20
the nation. California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer launched an investigation. A=
nd=20
FERC, in addition to the El Paso hearing, called an industry conference.
?????Plaintiffs' lawyers in the El Paso case say they believe the pressure=
=20
led El Paso Merchant Energy--which sells natural gas--to pass up an option =
to=20
renew its contract with El Paso Natural Gas Co., which owns the pipeline=20
system. Instead, El Paso Merchant settled for a much smaller chunk of=20
capacity on its sister company's system. El Paso says the decision was made=

for business reasons, not in response to pressure from regulators.

New Power Plant Proposed for Riverside County

By MITCHELL LANDSBERG, Times Staff Writer=20

?????Calpine Corp., on a breakneck pace to boost the amount of electricity =
it=20
produces in California, announced plans Friday to build a major power plant=
=20
in western Riverside County near the terminus of a hotly contested=20
transmission line.
?????The plant, the 10th the company has proposed constructing in Californi=
a,=20
would be in the unincorporated Romoland area between Hemet and Perris, and=
=20
would supply enough power for about 450,000 homes.
?????"As a California-based company, we are extremely pleased to, yet again=
,=20
move forward on a project such as this," said John King, senior vice=20
president of business development for Calpine, which is based in San Jose.=
=20
The company has been eager to distance itself from the out-of-state energy=
=20
suppliers whom Gov. Gray Davis has portrayed as public enemies for their ro=
le=20
in California's energy crisis.
?????State officials greeted the announcement somewhat warily, noting that=
=20
Calpine has announced plans before that didn't pan out. Until the company=
=20
formally applies for licensing, the California Energy Commission will reser=
ve=20
comment on the plans, spokesman Rob Schlichting said.
?????"It's basically a trial balloon," he said of the announcement.
?????Calpine officials said they intend to file an application for licensin=
g=20
with the commission in July and to begin construction of the $325-million=
=20
plant sometime in the middle of next year. They said the plant could be=20
running by 2004.
?????Greg Lamberg, Calpine's director of business development, said the=20
company has already held extensive discussions with local officials in=20
Riverside County and has encountered no community opposition.
?????"We're finding just the reverse--we're finding a tremendous level of=
=20
support in the community," Lamberg said.
?????Local officials could not immediately be reached for comment. There ha=
s=20
been substantial opposition to another electrical project in the same=20
vicinity, a proposed 500,000-volt transmission line that San Diego Gas &=20
Electric wants to build through southwestern Riverside County.
?????The line would end at Southern California Edison's Valley substation i=
n=20
Romoland. Calpine's proposed Inland Empire Energy Center would be built abo=
ut=20
half a mile from the substation, on vacant land along California 74 near=20
Interstate 215.
?????Proximity to the Edison substation--and to a nearby natural gas=20
pipeline--make the location ideal, Lamberg said. Calpine officials said the=
y=20
don't expect opposition to the SDG&E transmission line to translate into=20
opposition to their project.
?????"The reason folks are opposed to that line is that it's a means for Sa=
n=20
Diego to import power," said Calpine spokesman Kent Robertson. "What we're=
=20
doing is, we're building projects to serve the local community. We think it=
's=20
kind of an apples-and-oranges comparison."
?????The area immediately surrounding the site is industrial, and Lamberg=
=20
said the company believes the plant will not cast a large "footprint" on th=
e=20
environment. Calpine's plans call for a 600-megawatt combined cycle plant=
=20
that burns natural gas to generate electricity. Combined cycle plants, whic=
h=20
recycle their heat to make electricity a second time, are considered=20
extremely efficient and far cleaner than older, single cycle plants.
?????If the plant is licensed and built, it will help cement Calpine's=20
position as a major player in the California energy market. The company now=
=20
owns 11 mostly small, geothermal power plants in the state but has plans=20
underway for nine gas-fired plants that would add more than 5,000 megawatts=
=20
of power, enough to supply about 4 million homes. Three major plants are=20
already under construction in Northern California.

Prior to deregulation, we were all used to our electric bills which showed=

The last few months have seen a flurry of news stories about California 's=

resource. The sun delivers an average of 6 kilowatt- hours of energy per=20

concentrate the light intensity hundreds or thousands of times. This can be=

Even 1995 technology could supply every single watt of electricity that=20
California consumed in 1999, using the sunlight that falls on just a 14-mil=
e=20
square of otherwise useless desert land. Such a "combined cycle solar=20
concentrator" system can be built at less than one-third the cost of solar=

kilowatt-hour.=20
No pollution would be released by such a system, not even thermal pollution=

They are getting a boost from the National Federation of Independent=20
Business, which is setting up councils around the state to come up with=20
conservation solutions for small-business owners.=20
"Small businesses are operating on very narrow margins," said Martyn Hopper=

state director of the agency. "Energy is a bottom-line cost that affects=20
their ability to pay salaries and benefits and their ability to exist. So=
=20
anything they can do to shave costs will help."=20
Projections of 30-plus days of summer blackouts could cost California=20

consortium found. Paired with electricity rate hikes of about 35% for=20
small-business customers, merchants have been forced to think hard about wa=

The first thing Susan Cho did was remove every other bank of overhead=20

her husband, Suk, purchased a new industrial dryer and shirt presser that=

"I'd walk by and there would be two or three blouses in a machine," Cho sai=

"No more."=20
These small steps added up to big savings. Cho estimates she spends $300 to=

$400 less each month on electricity than she did a year ago. She told a=20
friend who also owns a dry cleaning shop what she had done, Cho said, and=

also shared tips with her Korean business association.=20
Trimming energy usage is trickier for Ackerman. The Orange County ice=20

But he does plan to turn off the air conditioning elsewhere and use=20
lower-energy fans near the freezer during summer months.=20
Ackerman also checked out the possibility of buying a gas-powered generator=

Critics say the utility just wants to save gardening costs.=20

Johandes, a big, white-bearded man who owned a Whittier company that=20

Some sign-carrying activists pressed their case before the San Luis Obispo=
=20
County Board of Supervisors last week. One supervisor, Khatchik Achadjian,=
=20
called on PG&E to put the tree-chopping project "on hold until a compromise=
=20
can be developed."=20
So far, PG&E has shown no indication of scaling back plans to begin clearin=
g=20
away undergrowth this month. Utility officials say protesters overstate the=
=20
damage, as well as the project's intent.=20
"Trees and the environment are very important to everyone, including PG&E,"=
=20
said Bill Roake, a spokesman for the company.=20
If PG&E has done anything to be ashamed of, he said, it is failing to=20
communicate effectively with the public. "We did not do a good job," Roake=
=20
said.=20
Some have accused PG&E of planning to clear-cut 15 miles of right-of-way fr=
om=20
the bluff on the coast where Diablo is located. Utility officials say fewer=
=20
than half the trees will be removed from a swath of brushland less than two=
=20
miles long between Carpenter and Price canyons. That is about 104 acres=20
altogether.=20
The goal, Roake said, is to open up the canopy so that fire cannot race alo=
ng=20
the tops of the trees and threaten the power lines.=20
"The lines are right above a very, very heavy [wood and brush] fuel load,"=
=20
said Roake. "If there is a fire, you could have lines disrupted coming out =
of=20
Diablo."=20
Diablo Canyon is PG&E's single largest producer of power. Even if the flame=
s=20
did not reach the overhead lines themselves, smoke from a fire could put=20
particulates in the air causing an arc, or crossover between adjacent lines=
.=20
Known as "phasing," that would essentially short-circuit the transmission=
=20
lines. Last year, Roake said, a small brush fire in the area knocked out th=
e=20
lines for more than six hours, though part of that problem was an unrelated=
=20
equipment failure.=20
A worst case scenario, however, could knock out Diablo Canyon for three to=
=20
four days, Roake said.=20
PG&E said the cutting is being done to satisfy the state's Independent Syst=
em=20
Operator, a nonprofit corporation whose job is to ensure the safety and=20
reliability of the state's energy grid.=20
Stephanie McCorkle, a spokeswoman, said the ISO did not order PG&E to remov=
e=20
trees. "PG&E's preference was to remove trees rather than trim them," she=
=20
said in an e-mail response to The Times.=20
Roake acknowledged that the ISO didn't tell the utility to remove the trees=
.=20
"We felt this was the best way to keep the [grid system] safe and reliable,=
"=20
he said.=20
As for allegations that PG&E is cutting down trees to save money on=20
maintenance, Roake acknowledged that safeguarding 108,000 miles of=20
transmission lines is a big job. The utility spends $138 million annually t=
o=20
trim or remove trees and brush.=20
But the tree project has nothing to do with its cash crunch, according to=
=20
PG&E. The Carpenter Canyon project was planned two years ago.=20
Johandes doesn't believe it. "They are doing it so they don't have to do=20
routine maintenance," he said.=20
PG&E has not made the argument, but conceivably could say it's not anybody'=
s=20
business what it does with vegetation on its property. Oaks are not=20
endangered. There are 11 million acres of oak woodlands in California ,=20
according to the California Oak Foundation.=20
On the other hand, the oak looms large in the California myth. "It is kind =
of=20
our signature tree," said Janet Cobb, president of the foundation.=20
The state has lost 1.5 million acres of oaks since 1945, according to Cobb.=
=20
The PG&E plan, she said, is "a travesty. I can't imagine what they're=20
thinking. Yes, some trees need to be thinned out, but this is butchering."=
=20
Roake denied that. PG&E said it is approaching the project cautiously. The=

first thing that will be done when work begins next week will be mowing dow=
n=20
the grassy underbrush known as ladder fuel. That could be an ignition point=

for fire. After that, dead and diseased trees will be taken out.=20
"Then we'll see what that does for the canopy," he said.

=20
The president's job rating in California , meanwhile, fell from 56% to 43%.=

Bush handed Davis a microphone to shout his message: that he's building=20
plants and conserving electricity --but only federal regulators can order=
=20
price relief, and they've refused. That word finally got through to people,=
=20
the governor thinks.=20
And this was why Davis had phoned--to stress that he does have a plan, an=

endgame, and it's working. Critics to the contrary.=20
"It's premature to declare victory. It's not the time to pop champagne=20
corks," he said. "But we're turning the corner."=20
Davis must have said "turning the corner" and attributed it to "leverage" 2=
0=20
times in our 30-minute conversation. And the anti-generator rhetoric rolled=
=20
naturally off his tongue, having by now become integral to his everyday=20
speech.=20
"The name of this game is leverage," he said. "If you don't have leverage=
=20
over these cowboys, they will steal you blind. They'll take every dime you=
=20
have, all the clothes you own, and be laughing all the way to the bank."=20
These cowboys, of course, are mostly Texans. Critics have protested that a=
=20
governor cannot keep calling people names and still expect to do business=
=20
with them.=20
"That's the only thing that gets their attention," Davis asserted. "They're=

"And then you have a governor who's quick to get in the face of greedy=20

=20
Davis recently went after municipal utilities, as well, after learning they=
=20
occasionally had been gouging the state even worse than the private=20
profiteers. The governor warned he'd seize their excess power unless they=
=20
agreed to sell it at a small profit, maybe 15%.=20
He was especially irked at the L.A. DWP, and told both Mayor Richard Riorda=
n=20
and Mayor-elect James K. Hahn.=20
"They didn't like it," Davis recalled. "They said it sounds like a threat. =

I reminded Davis that critics fault him for not acting more quickly a year=

Lieberman said Davis would appear on June 20 as the key witness. The event=

Electricity traders' tech habits get scrutiny=20

Mercury News=20


State officials investigating California's extraordinary energy prices are=
=20
zeroing in on how energy traders use the technology tools of their professi=
on=20
-- from e-mail and specialized software to Internet energy data sites and=
=20
online trading floors.=20
This technology may be key, they say, to helping traders acquire the intima=
te=20
knowledge needed to manipulate California's troubled energy market. With=20
minute-to-minute knowledge of market conditions, some traders went even=20
further, two lawsuits charge, illegally coordinating bids and sending=20
electricity prices to record-breaking levels.=20
The state Attorney General's Office has subpoenaed from power generators=20
software used to formulate bidding strategies, names of employees providing=
=20
computer support, communications with a prominent industry Web site and the=
=20
name of firms that handle computer networks.=20
And a state Senate committee has hired an information technology consultant=
=20
to help them look into how traders tracked patterns on the state's=20
Internet-based spot market, among other things.=20
``Once you were knowledgeable about its operations, the opportunity to game=
=20
it became pretty obvious,'' said Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Garden Grove, who chairs=
=20
the committee.=20
Anti-trust laws=20
Working together, or colluding, to fix prices is illegal and violates state=
=20
and federal anti-trust laws.=20
Sharing sensitive industry data, if it involved financial markets, would be=
=20
considered insider trading and would be treated far differently, said Anjal=
i=20
Sheffrin, head of market analysis for the Independent System Operator, whic=
h=20
manages the state's power grid.=20
The Securities and Exchange Commission polices the nation's stock markets,=
=20
but wholesale energy trading goes largely unwatched by federal regulators.=
=20
San Diego attorney Mike Aguirre agreed with Sheffrin. Aguirre is part of a=
=20
team of lawyers who have filed two lawsuits against leading power generator=
s=20
such as Dynegy, Duke Energy and Williams Energy Services.=20
``It's basically an embryonic kind of trading market that involves the=20
sharing of inside information, and the only reason they're getting away wit=
h=20
it is there's no SEC cop,'' he said.=20
Energy companies dismiss these charges as speculation.=20
``All of these `What ifs?'?'' said Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel. ``The fa=
ct=20
of the matter is we've played by the rules, we've acted ethically, we haven=
't=20
done anything wrong.''=20
Energy companies say the way they use technology is all above board.=20
``That's something that we're proud of, that we have all of the tools to do=
=20
the best possible job in the trading,'' said Paula Hall-Collins, spokeswoma=
n=20
for Tulsa-based Williams Co.=20
Not everyone is persuaded that energy companies actually conspired to hike=
=20
prices.=20
Some public officials and energy industry players call the technology focus=
 a=20
red herring. California's energy problems are far more fundamental, they sa=
y,=20
than click-happy energy traders with spreadsheets. The now-defunct Californ=
ia=20
Power Exchange, for example, was something of a sitting duck, unable to=20
freely shop around for the best electricity prices.=20
Wealth of data=20
Other experts believe the sheer wealth of data floating around -- from rive=
r=20
flows to 30-day forecasts of power line outages -- gives traders an unfair=
=20
advantage. ``That's exactly the issue,'' said Severin Borenstein, director =
of=20
the University of California Energy Institute. ``The issue is whether all=
=20
this information is actually doing more harm to competition than benefit to=
=20
the efficiency of procuring and selling power.''=20
The best illustration of this is a somewhat legendary Web site blunder.=20
In that incident, an energy industry association called the Western Systems=
=20
Coordinating Council posted highly sensitive real-time data about=20
transmission of extra-high voltage electricity in California.=20
Alarmed that such information could be used to game the market, the state's=
=20
grid operator last October demanded that the trade group take the informati=
on=20
off the site, which it did.=20
A former energy trader who spoke to the Mercury News on the condition that =
he=20
not be identified, said: ``When you can calculate exactly what a market nee=
ds=20
and where its surplus is going to come from, then you have the ability to=
=20
essentially fix prices. It's like a linear equation. You know exactly what=
=20
the end equation is going to be.''=20
At issue are how traders employ the tools that, like the telephone and fax=
=20
machine, are standard in trading electricity: software, data Web sites and=
=20
Internet energy exchanges.=20
Dunn and other public officials acknowledge that it isn't clear how=20
technology was used in suspected abuses. And no one has turned up slam-dunk=
=20
evidence of collusion.=20
The ISO has done extensive studies that conclude traders drove up prices=20
through gaming. The high prices have cost the state at least $6.7 billion=
=20
since May 2000.=20
``Energy traders trade information among themselves,'' the ISO's Sheffrin=
=20
charged, comparing it to insider-trading. ``These traders are calling each=
=20
other up all the time.''=20
The former energy trader who talked to the Mercury News agreed energy trade=
rs=20
as a very incestuous group.=20
They talk and e-mail every day. ``Sometimes many, many, many times a day,''=
=20
he said. ``Some of them have instant messaging.'' He said he believes it=20
could amount to ``de facto collusion.''=20
But proving collusion in court is extremely difficult.=20
The sticking point, said UC's Borenstein, is showing exactly what energy=20
traders did with the information.=20
``These guys aren't actually sitting down in a room together,'' Borenstein=
=20
said. ``They sort of watched each other and said, `Well, other firms are=20
keeping capacity out and we will too.'?''=20
The former energy trader said he doubted that investigators would prove=20
collusion because traders will cover their tracks. ``They're expunging=20
hard-drive data as we speak,'' he said. ``The documents are long gone.''=20
Lawsuits=20
Two class-action lawsuits, filed on behalf of taxpayers by San Francisco an=
d=20
by Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, accuse the energy companies of colluding to=20
drive up prices. Neither lawsuit clearly documents how the energy companies=
=20
engaged in secretive data-sharing.=20
The Bustamante suit, however, targets a new Internet site for wholesale=20
energy trading launched last fall by heavy-hitter energy companies such as=
=20
Duke and Reliant. The Atlanta-based Web site, IntercontinentalExchange, is=
=20
one of at least a dozen such electronic trading floors that have popped up =
on=20
the Internet in the last four years. None of these trading exchanges -- whi=
ch=20
analysts say are the wave of the future -- are regulated.=20
IntercontinentalExchange declined to comment since it is not a party to the=
=20
suit.=20
The lawsuit charges the site ``has several features that support collusive=
=20
behavior amongst market participants.''=20
One is that only approved traders have access to IntercontinentalExchange a=
nd=20
those traders can pick who they want to trade with and shut other traders=
=20
out. And more importantly, Aguirre said, the energy companies who own many =
of=20
these Web exchanges get the tremendous benefit of having a record of all th=
e=20
trades.=20
``It gives them an enormous amount of market data that no one else has acce=

Davis is down, but history and politics are on his side=20
Published Monday, June 11, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News=20
BY PHIL YOST=20
THE next time Gray Davis faces the voters is less than nine months away.=20
Before the March 5 primary election, blackouts could blight the summer,=20
generators could loot the state, utilities could sink into the ocean, and=
=20
Home Depot could run out of batteries.=20
Already, the energy crisis has made voters crabby. In the latest Field Poll=
,=20
49 percent had an unfavorable impression of Davis, as opposed to 44 percent=
=20
favorable.=20
Here, perhaps, is where the battered Republican Party, pinned against its o=
wn=20
goal line, can regain some of the ground lost in the 1998 and 2000 election=
s.=20
Perhaps Davis will even be weakened by a challenge from within his own=20
Democratic Party.=20
Don't be too hasty.=20
From January to June, the GOP's prospects undoubtedly thawed. Two candidate=
s=20
are already looking to take advantage: Bill Jones, California's secretary o=
f=20
state, and Bill Simon, a Los Angeles businessman and philanthropist.=20
But here's a bit of history discouraging for the Bills, neither of whom is=
=20
recognized by even half the voters in the state. The last California govern=
or=20
to be denied a second term by the voters was Culbert Olson, in 1943.=20
Davis will not answer to all the voters in March, only Democratic ones. Cou=
rt=20
rulings have eliminated California's short-lived blanket primaries and=20
restored the partisan contests. So he has two summers before the November=
=20
2002 election to get the power puzzle solved.=20
All the same, politics is an arena in which anything can happen. (Your hono=
r,=20
I call Jesse Ventura to the stand.) And what Republicans more and more are=
=20
hoping will happen is that Los Angeles will send to the governor's office i=
ts=20
departing mayor, Richard Riordan. Riordan says he's thinking about running.=
=20
A Field Poll in late May showed Riordan even with Davis in voter preference=
,=20
while Jones and Simon trailed by double digits. President Bush has called o=
n=20
Riordan to run. Last week, 14 Republican legislators, of the 44 in the=20
Assembly and Senate, and 16 of California's 20 Republican members of Congre=
ss=20
signed a letter urging Riordan to be a candidate.=20
Given the beaten down state of the Republican party in California, one of=
=20
Riordan's advantages for the general election is that he is thought of firs=
t=20
as the mayor of Los Angeles, and only second as a Republican. It's an=20
accurate picture. He opposed the immigrant-bashing Proposition 187. He=20
supports gay rights and is generally pro-choice. He has endorsed Democratic=
=20
Sen. Dianne Feinstein in the past.=20
Plenty of Republicans will find plenty to dislike there. But they should ge=
t=20
realistic about what sort of candidate is electable. Socially conservative=
=20
Dan Lungren, the GOP candidate in 1998, got pounded. The 2000 election=20
offered no suggestion that California voters were moving rightward.=20
Riordan, a very wealthy man, could put $30 million or more of his own money=
=20
into the campaign, which is what Davis already has collected. Yet Riordan's=
=20
performance as L.A. mayor insulates him from the charge that he is a rich m=
an=20
playing at politics.=20
Jones, who is from Fresno, has done a commendable job in his eight years as=
=20
secretary of state. But he offended many Republicans by the way in which he=
