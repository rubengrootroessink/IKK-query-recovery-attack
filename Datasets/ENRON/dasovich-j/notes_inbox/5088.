I don't have the consumer forms you reference.  I assume those were sent to 
Jeff, is that correct?  Could you please resend.  Let's set up a call for 2 
p.m. this afternoon and discuss the other items.  If that time does not work, 
let me know what would.  Thanks.

Subject: CA ETI tariff(s)


Mona: 

Attached are 2 versions of the CA tariff(s) - one has redlines and the other 
is clean.? We have included the new national ETI template service 
descriptions and terms, as well as California specific regulatory language. 

You will recall that we originally filed "placeholder" tariffs with the ETI 
CPCN, which were approved with certain required modifications, and these new 
tariffs will now be ETI's "Initial Tariff" filed at the CPUC.?? Subsequent 
revisions and updates can be made via Advice Letter. 

ETI can make the time and materials, special construction, and collo sections 
"ICB", though we are unsure why ETI would want to include collo in the tariff 
- this is an item you can discuss with Steve and me. Also, the new "early 
termination" contract language appears unusual, given especially that your 
written contracts would cover this, and that an otherwise "verbal" contract 
would be unenforceable.? It is thus not necessary to include the new contract 
termination terms in the California tariff. 

Items for discussion before filing include: 

There is standard early termination protection language in the tariff, and 
the new terms may not be necessary;
We still need to establish (high) rates for the transport services, and 
insert the figures.
Does ETI want to keep collo in the tariff?
We need ETI's operational approval for the Consumer forms previously sent. 
(The Consumer forms must be attached to the tariff).


Please feel free to let me know any questions over the weekend - I can be 
reached via office voice mail or cell phone (609-2210).? Otherwise we should 
talk on Monday morning before filing.? Thanks, 

Jeremy Meier
