We're already into the third week of the HW Survivor Contest - two
contestants have been given the boot and five contestants remain.  Now is
your chance to sway the results - go to www.haasweek.net and vote somebody
off of the HaasWeek Island!  The polls are only open until Wednesday at 5pm,
so vote now!

Immunity challenge update: this past weekend we held our second immunity
challenge, and we tied it in with the Special Olympics Fall Sports Classic
held up in Sacramento.  The HW Survivor contestant who recruited the most
participants for the weekend gained immunity for Round 3, and this time it
was no contest!  Wendy Hsu earned immunity for the second straight round
when 7 volunteers gave her credit for recruiting them, plus Wendy showed up
herself for an additional two points!  No other HW Survivor contestant got
more than one.  So congratulations, Wendy - another round of breathing easy!

Remeber to vote!  (Oh, and vote in the government elections on Tuesday,
too.)
Thanks,
HaasWeek
