Sounds good.  You can reach me at 415.782.7822.  Because my schedule is a 
mess (thanks to the mess California has created), if you don't reach me on my 
office line, please try 415.505.6633.  Also, I think that it would be very 
useful to have Leslie Lawner on, since she's involved a lot in California gas 
matters, but it's your call.  Just let me know.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff, for the meeting on Thurs a.m.  9:30 ( Houston Time ), we should keep 
our group to the list I have identified. I would like to start with a simple 
plan and work out from there. We are working towards an action plan for 
handling PUC issues ( from a commercial perspective) in california and other 
states, prior to anybody addressing the PUC we need agreement as to what it 
is we want to put forward. 

We will call you on thurs a.m.  Can you please verify your contact phone 
number.  

Thanks in advance. 

Jessica, pls reserve a room.
