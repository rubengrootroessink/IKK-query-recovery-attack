Hi.  Just make sure we're aware of the Commission's approval as soon as 
possible so that we can prepare to make a bid.  THanks.

SCE is awaiting a commission order to auction off its SO2 credits.  Janel 
Guerrero is very interested in this.  Please let her know once a final order 
is issued.  Thanks.

Thanks for the voice mail/update on SoCal Ed. It makes sense that everything 
is moving slowly behind the power issues.  Talk with you soon!
