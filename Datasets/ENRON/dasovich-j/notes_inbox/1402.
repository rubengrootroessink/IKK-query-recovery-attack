Sue:

Per our phone conference with Steve Bowen last Friday, the 27th, please
find attached the Advanced Services FCC Order you requested.  This
established ISP traffic as interstate in nature and under the FCC's
jurisdiction.  The Order is at 13 FCC Rcd. 22, 466, In the Matter of GTE
Telephone Operating Cos, CC Docket No. 98-79, FCC 98-292, released
October 30, 1998.

This is probably more germane to current EBS issues than the Collo Order
sent Oct. 29, 2000 to you, and together should provide you with a sense
of current Federal issues.  Please let me know if you need additional 
assistance.

We are also preparing the MSA language regarding the 10% interstate
traffic Rule and will send it this week.
