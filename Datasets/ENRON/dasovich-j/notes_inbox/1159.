Argus Roundtable, Wednesday, November 29, 7:00pm ET
Watch it via streaming live video!
----------------------------------------------------------------

Subject: "Special Situations and Contrarian Ideas"

The conventional wisdom in early 2000 was that
the New Economy Technology Sector would continue to
lift the stock market to new heights. So why are
old-economy groups such as Electric Utilities
and Real Estate Investment Trusts the top performers so
far this year? Because they offered great value at a time
of opportunistic change in their industries. Looking ahead
to 2001, John Eade and Argus analysts will preview some
sectors that may offer similar surprises to investors.
