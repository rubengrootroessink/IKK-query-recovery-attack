Here is the advice letter from SCE.  We are not part of the QF group in IEP, 
so we will not be participating in the conference call tomorrow.  We can 
always get info from Steven Kelly is we need it.  If you need one of us to 
"interpret" this filing, let us know.

		 Subject: Fw: SCE Emergency Motion re December SRAC postings


FYI - SCE filed an Emergency Motion re December SRAC postings.  Unlike last
time, wherein SCE is not unilaterally paying less than the posted numbers.
Rather, they are asking for Commission approval to change the SRAC formula.
They propose to modify the "factor" in the existing formula, and replacing
the gas index (currently a simple average of the three published Topock
border price indices) to an index based on a 10/90 averatge consisting of
10% of the simple average of the three border indices at Topock and 90% of
the SoCalGas monthly published G-CS cost of gas.  SCE is seeking application
of the new formula for December or, alternatively, asking for notification
to QFs of the potential for retroactive treatment for the month of December.

We will discuss this filing on the conference call tomorrow (9:30 a.m. on
Thursday, previously scheduled).  SCE is asking the Commission to require
parties to file comments on December 1, 2000.
