Jeff -

Can you please keep Schroeder in the loop on all final documents that we 
would use?  Europe is talking about how crazy Calif is and we need to make 
sure that they are in the loop.

Jim

Mark --

FYI, we gave the following to the Bush Transition team about what is really 
happening in California.  If there is anyone on your team (you?) who should 
be getting copies of the material we generate, let me know so that we can 
copy.

As we all deal with the fallout from the California scene, I wanted to make 
sure everyone was aware of the recent report of the UK's National Audit 
Office (a highly creible organisation, along the lines of the US's General 
Accounting Office, even similar function; independent, too), saying that 
household electricity bills had been cut by 750 million pounds (if you are a 
Yank, multiply by 1.5 for dollars saved), since the industry was opened to 
competition two years ago.  Of course, much of this may be attributable to 
the divestment of assets in the oligopolistic generation sector, now 
competitive, but it is a very fari example of the benefits of competition and 
should be cited as a counterweight to those arguing that competition is a 
"failed experiment".  Paul Dawson, head of our UK regulatory team, can 
provide any necessary further insights./details.   mcs
