????????????  PG&E has?filed the attached, =01&Motion to Establish Final Ma=
rket =20
Valuation of Non-Nuclear Generating Assets Pursuant to Public Utilities Cod=
e =20
Section 367.=018? The motion requests  that the Commission consolidate in t=
he=20
docket used for the recent rate  stabilization decision the existing record=
=20
of PG&E=01,s remaining major  non-nuclear generating asset market valuation=

proceedings and immediately adopt  a final market valuation for all of PG&E=

remaining non-nuclear generating  assets.? The market valuation dockets tha=

would be consolidated in this  proceeding include A.99-09-053 (hydroelectri=

??? ???  ??? The utility requests that this be done?prior to  establishing=

the revenue requirements and rates for PG&E=01,s retained  generating asset=
s=20
pursuant to the June 15 Chief ALJ=01,s Ruling.? That ruling set a hearing=

services.?  PG&E asks that the?Commission rule on its Motion as soon as=20
possible  and no later than July 19, so that PG&E and interested parties ha=
ve=20
the  benefit of the ruling prior to the beginning of hearings on July 23,=
=20
2001.

PG&E argues that since the Commission has  not completed market valuations=
=20
for PG&E=01,s generating assets,?it  therefore may not legally determine th=
e=20
value of those assets for ratemaking  purposes until such time as those=20
market valuations are complete.? In fact, there has been no action =20
whatsoever in?PG&E=01,s hydroelectric market valuation proceeding since  Ja=
nuary=20

nd=20
public participation hearings, and extending the comment period  on the dra=
ft=20
environmental impact report.

The utility stresses that Section 367(b) of  the PU Code?requires the=20
Commission to market value the utilities=01,  generation assets =01&not lat=
er than=20
December 31, 2001,=018 and that it has to be,  =01&based on appraisal, sale=
 or=20

 First=20
Extraordinary Session modified Section 377 to?prohibit  PG&E from selling a=
ny=20
of its existing generating assets until at least  January 1, 2006, and=20
requires that those assets be dedicated for the benefit of  California=20
ratepayers.? Since AB 6X  precludes the Commission from valuing PG&E=01,s=
=20
generating assets by sale or  divestiture, appraisal is the only lawful=20
method.

PG&E concludes that effective January 1,  2002, its non-nuclear retained=20
generation must be reflected in utility rates on  the same basis as the=20
market value determined for purposes of AB 1890 stranded  cost computations=
.?=20
Therefore,  the?market valuations adopted by the Commission will have to be=
=20
included in  the consideration of URG ratemaking in this proceeding.? The=
=20
motion says that the?valuations  are also essential prerequisites to the=20
determination of any amounts that might  be made available under the curren=
t=20
rate structure for payment to the DWR as  provided for in AB1X.? PG&E =20
concludes that market valuation of its retained generating assets is an =20
essential prerequisite to establishing their revenue requirement, which is =

hardly illogical.
