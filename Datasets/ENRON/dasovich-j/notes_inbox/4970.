* Account Type:         Checking

* Account Number: 593853800
plus your 8 digit Schwab account number

Your refund will be automatically deposited into the Schwab,
Schwab One(R), or Schwab Access(TM) account you designate. (If
you direct your refund to an IRA account, make sure that the
deposited funds stay within your annual contribution limit).

10. Transferring Accounts Into Schwab? It's Gotten Even Easier
----------------------------------------------------------------
We've simplified the process of transferring assets from another
financial institution into an existing Schwab account. Whether
you are transferring specific assets or an entire account, you
can get underway and save valuable time by using the Account
Transfer form on schwab.com.

By starting the transfer online, you save time because your
Schwab account information is automatically filled in for you.
You don't need to wait for an application in the mail, either
from Schwab or from the other institution. Follow the simple
instructions, print, sign and mail the form to us(we still need
to get your signature on a hard copy) and we'll do the rest.

Log-in now and see how easy it is to transfer your account:
http://schwab.ed10.net/ud/IFYP/6JW/GTM/6C/LJR34

Some mutual funds cannot be transferred into a Schwab account,
so check first with your existing mutual fund account before
starting the transfer.
