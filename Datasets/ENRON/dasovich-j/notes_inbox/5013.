Group,

Here's the raw data from the California poll.  Great news, here.   As you can 
see by the progression of the numbers, by slightly changing the message, we 
went from getting killed by the Davis plan to actually breaking even with it 
and even beating it significantly.  

Some takeaways:

 1.  By using the right words, a competing/alternate plan to the governor's 
will win in the polls.
 2.  Education is at least as important as electricity.
 3.  The thought of wiping out the budget surplus by spending it on the grid, 
rather than schools and hospitals, tilts        the scales in our favor.
 4.  Finally, by broadening the demand buy-down program to "consumers," we 
win the argument by a wide         margin.

Next steps:

Take a look at the results.  Pay special attention to how the words matter, 
especially on the questions where our results improved as we altered the 
message.  By late Monday, we'll have the crosstabs. We won't have the full 
analysis and presentation until Friday, though, so I don't think we should 
share the poll with anybody until then.  We could use a few of the numbers in 
the business letter and with VERY good friends in the Assembly.

The key questions are 19, 21, 24, 45 (look at how a change in wording changed 
the results), 46 (another example of better wording yielding better results, 
especially on the March 8 poll), 49, 50, 51 (in particular, March 7-8 poll).


See you on the call.

Mark
