Market Lessons from 2000

Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued a watershed RTO decision last =
=20
week which could lead to substantial expansion of PJM into the Northeast, P=
JM=01,
s  State of the Market Report 2000 contains some interesting information an=
d =20
lessons for us.=20

After the California experience demonized spot electricity  markets, it wou=
ld=20
surprise many that PJM=01,s 2000 spot energy market was a  bargain. Spot pr=
ices=20
in 2000 were below $30.00 per megawatt-hour (MWh), or three  cents per=20
kilowatt-hour (kWh), 70.88 percent of the hours in the year. The  single=20
highest hourly price was $810 per MWh or 81 cents per kWh, but prices =20
reached or exceeded $200 per MWh during only 13 hours in the entire year =
=20
(download charts on our website by typing=20
www.pennfuture.org/items/hourlypricecharts_71601.pdf in your browser). By=
=20
contrast, California experienced spot  prices that often exceeded $200 per=
=20
MWh for most of the last 12 months.

Authored by the PJM Market Monitoring Unit =01* but likely reviewed  and ed=
ited=20
by top PJM management =01* the Report delivered to FERC concludes that  all=
 of=20
the markets operated by PJM were "reasonably competitive." It cautions, =20
however, that,

"there are potential threats to competition in the energy,  capacity and=20
regulation markets that require ongoing scrutiny and in some cases  may=20
require action in order to maintain competition. Market participants do =20
possess some ability to exercise market power under certain conditions in=
=20
PJM  markets."=20

In order to maintain and improve the functioning of the PJM  markets, the=
=20
Report recommends:

Retention of the $1000/MWh bid cap in the PJM energy market  and=20
investigation of other rule changes to reduce incentives to exercise  marke=
t=20
power.

Retention of the $100/mw bid cap in the PJM regulation market. =20

Evaluation of additional actions to increase demand-side  responsiveness to=
=20
price in both energy and capacity markets.

Modification of incentives in the capacity market to require  all Load=20
Serving Entities (LSEs) to meet their obligations to serve load on a =20
longer-term basis, and require all capacity resources to be offered on a =
=20
comparable longer-term basis.

The Report uses several analytical methods to reach these  recommendations=
=20
and conclusions, including looking at the net revenue for  generation from=
=20
all sources, the increase in bid amount over marginal cost,  market=20
concentration (as measured using the HHI index), and lastly an analysis  of=
=20
the resulting prices.
=20

See Spot go to market
Perhaps the Report=01,s most intriguing  information on price trends concer=
ns=20
the spot energy market, where average  prices declined by 9.81 percent from=
=20
1999 levels. Driven by lower peak prices in  the most expensive 100 hours o=
f=20
the year, the average locational marginal price  (LMP) in 2000 was $30.72 p=
er=20
MWh (3.072 cents per kWh), falling from the 1999  average of $34.06 per MWh=
=20
(3.406 cents per kWh). This average price decline in  the spot market was=
=20
more significant because it occurred even though fuel costs  were sharply=
=20
higher in 2000. Indeed, the average fuel-adjusted LMP in 2000  declined to=
=20
$24.78 per MWh, or 27.25 percent from the 1999 price of $34.06 per  MWh.=20

And when one compares 2000 spot market prices to competitive  future prices=
=20
for the year 2000 and to 1996 regulated rates for generation, it  becomes=
=20
clear that spot market prices in 2000 were significantly lower than 2000 =
=20
future contracts. Even with appropriate price adjustments to facilitate =20
comparison, they were also much lower than 1996 regulated residential=20
generation  rates for all hours charged by Pennsylvania=01,s six major elec=
tric=20
utilities,  which ranged from about $51 dollars to $85 dollars per MWh, or=
=20
5.1 to 8.5 cents  per kWh.=20


The lesson
Spot market prices, which received so much bad  publicity as a result of th=
e=20
California fiasco, can be a bargain and customers  who are able to manage=
=20
their demand to reduce or avoid the hours of high spot  prices can reap maj=
or=20
savings by purchasing electricity from the spot  market.

In fact, spot market prices in 2000 were below most of  Pennsylvania=01,s=
=20
shopping credits or "prices to compare." That's saying something,  since th=
e=20
shopping credits in turn are as much as 4.0 cents per kWh less than  the 19=
96=20
regulated rate for just generation paid by customers to the monopoly =20
utilities.=20


But=01(
Since spot market prices in 2000 were well below both  the 1996 generation=
=20
rate paid to monopolies and the much lower shopping credits,  why were ener=
gy=20
suppliers increasingly unable to offer electricity at prices  below the=20
shopping credits?=20

ICAP pricing and reliance by electricity suppliers on higher  priced future=
=20
or forward market contracts supply most of the answer.=20

The spot market gives a good indication of what the forward  markets should=
=20
be under typical circumstances. As the data below indicate, the  average sp=
ot=20
market price for all market locations in 2000 was $30.72/MWh,  almost 10=20
percent less than during 1999, and more than 27 percent lower upon  adjusti=

While the dramatically lower standard deviation in 2000 indicates  that=20
prices were much less volatile than in 1999, there remained a substantial =
=20
gap between average and median prices, indicating that extreme prices durin=
g=20
a  small number of hours continued to substantially skew overall average=20
prices. =20


Grading on a curve
The PJM 2000 price duration curves,  measuring the percent of time prices=
=20
were at or below a particular level, tell  an interesting story. As one wou=
ld=20
expect with higher fuel prices, especially  for natural gas, the general=20
trend was for prices to be slightly higher during  periods where natural ga=
s=20
was the marginal fuel. For approximately 99 percent of  all hours, 2000=20
energy prices were more expensive than in 1999. Yet, with  relatively low=
=20
peak demand, the price for the most expensive 1 percent of demand  during=
=20
2000 was considerably lower in 2000 than in 1999, accounting for the  entir=
e=20
9.81 percent average reduction in 2000 prices from 1999. If not  for the=20
reduced prices for the most expensive 1 percent of demand, overall  prices=
=20
for 2000 likely would have risen approximately 18 percent over 1999, due =
=20
largely to higher fuel costs.=20

For these reasons, the Report recommendation to "evaluate"  additional=20
actions to increase demand-side responsiveness is SEVERELY  understated. PJ=
M=20
and all consumers have an essential interest in implementing  demand-side=
=20
response programs to the maximum economic level, with dramatic  implication=
s=20
for saving individual consumers money, improving system  reliability, keepi=
ng=20
market prices lower for everyone, and improving market  competitiveness.=20


Can everyone say I-C-A-P?
So with the lower wholesale  energy prices and plenty of supply, why did th=
e=20
retail market sputter?=20

Installed capacity (ICAP) price increases are a partial  explanation. In=20
addition to energy, the controversial charge for ICAP is the  other=20
significant cost born by electricity consumers within PJM. ICAP represents =
 a=20
call option on physical generation resources by PJM during system=20
emergencies.  All LSEs are required to purchase an amount of installed=20
capacity equivalent to  their customer=01,s peak load contribution plus an=
=20
adequate reserve margin,  currently 19 percent. But although it exists for=
=20
reliability purposes, PJM  curtailed the export of energy outside PJM from=
=20
PJM-committed installed capacity  on only one day during 2000.=20

Logically, the price for installed capacity, like the price of  energy, mig=
ht=20
have been expected to decrease during 2000. Yet that didn't occur.  As ener=
gy=20
prices decreased within PJM, they remained high or continued to  increase i=
n=20
surrounding control areas. Higher prices in the surrounding markets  led so=
me=20
generation owners to de-list their generation committed to PJM in order  to=
=20
sell out to other control areas without the risk of being curtailed by PJM.=
 =20
The result was an increase in ICAP prices from an average of $52.86 in 1999=
=20
to  $60.55 in 2000. The increase was concentrated over the summer with pric=
es=20
in the  daily markets rising to $177 or more for most of June, July and=20
August. The  increase in ICAP prices raised the cost of supplying many reta=
il=20
customers by  about 1 cent per kWh. The Market Monitoring Unit concluded th=
at=20
the price spikes  over the summer months were a direct result of the=20
opportunity cost associated  with the prices in neighboring control areas.

But the Report=01,s finding that the ICAP market was "reasonably  competiti=
ve"=20
seems inconsistent with PJM=01,s conclusion last year that the 2000  ICAP m=
arket=20
performed so poorly that it needed a major overhaul. This  inconsistency=20
raises questions about the reasonableness of that portion of the  2000 Repo=
rt=20
or giving the 2000 ICAP market the PJM seal of approval.=20

PJM has invested substantial time and resources since last summer  in an=20
extensive stakeholder process to revise its ICAP rules, especially =20
concerning the allocation of deficiency revenues and the interval over whic=
h =20
ICAP is purchased. But since the "reformed" ICAP market began operating onl=
y =20
recently on July 1, 2001, it's too soon to know whether it is functioning=
=20
well  or competitively. We remain skeptical that the PJM prescription cures=

Recent developments
Both in the East and West coast markets  this week, electricity in daily=20
trading has been near its low for the 52-week  period. Several developments=
=20
are pushing down the price of wholesale  electricity. Mild weather, falling=
=20
gas prices, new generation coming online,  increasing demand response and=
=20
conservation as well as a FERC which understands  that competition must exi=
st=20
prior to price deregulation, are all pushing prices  lower. Moreover, forwa=
rd=20
market prices for 2002 within PJM are beginning to fall  and are under=20
downward price pressure.=20

The new downward trend in forward markets partially results from  moderate=
=20
prices this summer, even during high demand periods, with prices  generally=
=20
staying under $150 MWh/$0.15 kWh. A good example of this was July 10,  a=20
relatively hot day with significant demand, which saw prices reach $150 per=
 =20
MWh for one hour but average $62.78 per MWh for all on-peak hours.=20

What's driving forward prices lower?

More efficient generation being installed (below 8000 btu/kWh  as opposed t=
o=20
11000 btu/kWh).

More ICAP in the market (new capacity estimated at over 4000  MW with load=
=20
growth at only 1.5 percent or 1000 MW).

More demand-responsive load in the form of 300 additional MW  of Active Loa=
d=20
Management.

The addition of PJM West slated for 2002, with lower prices  generally.=20

Lower natural gas prices =01* falling from $4.0561 /mmBtu in July  2000 to=
=20
$3.29/mmBtu as of July 12, 2001.

This good news, which suggests that retail customers in late 2001  or 2002=
=20
may again see retail competitive offers below the Pennsylvania shopping =20
credits, must be weighed against the troubled ICAP market. ICAP remains an =
=20
anachronism. ICAP prices have not returned to competitive levels and remain=
=20
one  of the significant obstacles to serving retail customers. The forward=
=20
prices for  ICAP alone have remained above 10 percent of the typical shoppi=

Yet even in the world of ICAP there is hope. ICAP prices may be  beginning =

Tomorrow's homework
The State of the Market Report contains  plenty of data which confirms that=
=20
PJM is the country=01,s best-run independent  system operator and best (tho=
ugh=20

below 1996 regulated generation rates, even with  appropriate adjustments.=
=20
But none of this warrants complacency. Only when PJM  becomes the first=20

electricity, will the wholesale and retail markets within PJM be  FULLY, as=
