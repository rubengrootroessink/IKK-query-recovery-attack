NEW EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE MANAGEMENT OF TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM BRINGS HIS 
VALLEY CONNECTIONS TO HAAS
 Drew Isaacs, the new executive director of the Management of Technology 
Program, is focusing his efforts on linking Silicon Valley to the Haas 
School. Isaacs is building on his connections and contacts from almost 20 
years of working and consulting in Silicon Valley high-tech organizations to 
expand MOT's outreach in the Valley.

MOT is a joint effort of the Haas School, the College of Engineering, and the 
School of Information Management and Systems. Through instruction, research, 
and outreach components, MOT focuses on the set of management activities 
associated with bringing high-tech products to market. Robert Cole, the 
Lorraine Tyson Mitchell II Professor of Leadership and Communication, and 
Paul Wright, the A. Martin Berlin Professor of Mechanical Engineering, are 
the academic co-directors of the program.

Before to coming to Haas, Isaacs was a marketing executive in Silicon Valley 
and Tokyo, a scientist at the NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston, and 
founder and president of California Technology International, a high-tech 
consulting firm in Sunnyvale, which he still runs.

Since being named MOT's executive director in May, Isaacs has pushed hard to 
enhance the program on several fronts. First, he is working on a corporate 
outreach initiative that connects students to Silicon Valley companies, 
working in real time on projects that have a direct impact at the companies. 

Says Isaacs, "This is a huge time and mind-share commitment to Haas by 
Silicon Valley companies. We have established partnerships with Silicon 
Valley companies committed to challenging our students with meaningful 
projects, woven into the academic experience here at Haas. Students and 
companies both make significant commitments, and the result is an 
extraordinary partnership with the Valley." This program grew out of the 
course Isaacs taught at Haas last spring, Opportunity Recognition: Technology 
and Entrepreneurship in Silicon Valley, which partnered students with several 
of the national labs and with high-tech companies.

Isaacs has also been using his contacts in Silicon Valley to add to MOT's 
existing donor base. Since May, he has raised about $200,000 in pledges and 
gifts.

On October 18, Isaacs launches the new MOT lecture series with a lecture by 
Aart de Geus, founder and chairman of Synopsys, Inc., titled "Management 
Evolution in Silicon Valley." Isaacs has selected as speakers in this new 
series founders, scholars, and analysts from Silicon Valley and elsewhere to 
Haas. Isaacs has also been working to expand MOT's connections with Boalt 
Hall, and will feature Boalt faculty lectures on intellectual property law as 
part of the new MOT lecture series. The schedule for the Fall 2000 MOT 
Lecture Series follows below.

HOMECOMING AND REUNION EVENTS BRING ALUMNI AND STUDENTS TOGETHER
 This Saturday, October 14, the Haas School will be buzzing with events to 
celebrate this year's MBA reunion classes and homecoming football game.? Over 
400 Haas alumni are expected at the game and reunion events. 

Alumni career advisor John Morel will start off the day at 10:00 a.m. with a 
discussion on job hunting techniques and procedures using the Internet, 
targeted job searches, and practical techniques to land a job. Also at 10:00 
a.m. the Alumni Entrepreneurs Panel brings back some of the Haas School's 
most recent success stories. Kim Fisher, MBA 94, co-founder of 
audiobasket.com, Keval Desai, MBA 99, co-founder of Achex.com, Alan S. 
Knitowski, MBA 99, founder of Vovida Networks, and Ciaran Quinn, MBA 90, 
co-founder of VEO will share how they got started, what their experiences 
have taught them, and what they have achieved. Special events are planned for 
the reunion classes (years ending in 0's and 5's.) To date, the class of 1990 
has the largest number of returning alumni. 

The pre-game Jambalaya Jubilee starts at 11:30 a.m. with New Orleans style 
food and drinks in the Haas courtyard accompanied by Zydeco music. The 
kick-off time for the Cal vs. UCLA game has been moved to 12:30 p.m. 
(originally 3:30 p.m.), so get to the Jambalaya early.? The change in the 
kick-off time resulted in the cancellation of the Alumni Connections Mixer.

as part of a larger piece on venture capitalists searching on university 
campuses for businesses to fund. Fogarty works for Information Technology 
University as a campus partner reviewing business plans.

Administration and director of the University of California Energy Institute, 
was quoted in the Los Angeles Times on October 9, in an article on Unocal's 
patenting of the process to make reformulated gasoline. Borenstein said that 
the patent may be legal but ultimately has made consumers worse off.

chair of the Marketing Group, was quoted in the San Francisco Chronicle on 
October 6 on the decline in door-to-door salesmen. In the article "A Brush

they will not disappear completely.

Borenstein was quoted in the October 3 Chicago Tribune on the effect that 
high natural gas prices will have on incentives to explore for more gas.
