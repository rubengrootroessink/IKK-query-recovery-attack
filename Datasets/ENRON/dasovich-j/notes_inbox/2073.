Sue, Mona,

1.  Tomorrow Martin Wenzel is speaking at a 1200 BOMA Luncheon at the 
Sheraton Palace Hotel at the Corner of Market and New Montgomery in San 
Francisco.  Martin was hoping that one of you might be available to attend.  
He thought that if you were not busy it might be valuable to have a 
government affairs expert available in case any tough regulatory questions 
came up.  If you are both busy I am sure we will get by.  We are currently 
trying to structure a new offering for their membership in the greater East 
Bay Area.



2.  Below is an excerpt from an e-mail I received from a customer.  My first 
inclination is that the customer is talking about the $65.00 rate cap in 
place in SDG&E and does not understand the implementation.  But this customer 
happens to be very savvy and is normally very involved in the regulatory 
environment.  Is there a new issue regarding some type of $65.00 rate cap 
that is being discussed for 2001 that is different from the current SDG&E 
proposal?  If so, what are the details.  As you can see below, depending on 
how it is implemented, it could be a problem.  My interpretation of the 
comments below is that this customer thinks a $65.00 rate cap is going to be 
put in place in 2001 and any charges above this cap are going to be shared by 
all rate payers equally. Therefore, it does them no good to lock in a higher 
price with an ESP if the market price is above $65.00.  I have a phone call 
in to the customer to get more details.


"We should talk about prices for next year, because it is my belief that UDC
prices must be below $65.00 next year; any price above that mark should be
ignored by customers, and I would be happy to explain why."
