Jan,
I agree that the meetings are too large.  However, I think it is imperative 
that each discipline be represented in the meeting.  To that end, I would ask 
that each of Accounting, Regulatory and Legal send no more than two 
representatives to participate in the TARL meeting in Houston.  A commercial 
person should attend as well.  The only exception to this rule should be a 
temporary exception for you and Mike to call in, with other exceptions to be 
made as hot issues arise.

Angie will see what she can do about arranging a videoconference but does not 
make any promises, as any type of conference room is difficult to find these 
days.

Minutes would be great.  Given that the most recent TARL meeting was entirely 
about your area of responsibility, we volunteer you to write those minutes.

Thanks.

Dear all:

Following my experience of the last meeting, my feeling is that we need more 
to focus on some items instead of having ever expanding discussions. I am in 
favour of having smaller meetings instead of big cometogethers. I thing that 
meeting should focus on two or three subjects and having smaller teams to 
work out solutions on specified tasks. I also think that we can achieve 
better time efficiency without losing the learning effect of discussing.

A second point would be my preference to have you on the screen. In 
particular for those dialling in from abroad, it would be helpful in order to 
better follow the discussion.

Lastly, I wonder whether it would not be useful to have short minutes of 
every meeting for those who did not succeed in participating.

Let me have your thoughts on these suggestions.

Jan

Subject: TAR&L MEETINGS, 1/25, 2/1 & 2/8

I have reserved conference room EB 4325 for the next 3 TAR&L meetings (1/25, 
2/1 & 2/8).  The meeting will run from 8:30 to 11:30 and a light breakfast 
will be served.

The dial in number for these next 3 meetings is as follows:

Host (Wayne):   1-888-232-3866, passcode 860073 (host only)

There are a total of seven ports and automatic port expansion should 
additional parties wish to join in.  All that is necessary is to dial the
