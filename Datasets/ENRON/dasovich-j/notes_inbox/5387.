Jeff:

I took a crack at expressing our thoughts on the exit strategy below.  I am
not really happy with it in either tone or content and would welcome your
input so that we can have more persuasive testimony tonight.

Gratefully,

Principles to Create a Healthy Competitive Electricity Market

The Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group is concerned by the absence of a
systematic and expedited exit strategy for the state from the power
business.  We are convinced that planning for and creating a competitive
electricity market is the most effective means to long-term stability and
cost-competitiveness for all consumers in California.

There are certain principles that, if followed, will help lead us to the
kind of stability and cost-effective power that Californians want.  We
recommend that follow-up legislation to AB1X provide the guidelines for thi=
s
exit strategy with the following concepts:

1. Keep the utilities solvent and spread out the payback of the CTC over
several years
2. Encourage the DWR to buy the least amount of power necessary to stabiliz=
e
the market for the least amount of time.  It does not take a lot of fixed
priced contracts to stabilize the market
3. Establish an objective trigger (based on credit worthiness) for the
utilities to assume long-term contracts.
4. Allow customers to have direct access and real choice while providing
necessary protections to assure the state that the bonds can be repaid =01)
5. Direct long-term customer contracts are beneficial for the State because
it lessens the burden of the DWR to obtain power, particularly at peak
demand times.
6. Remove barriers to on-site generation to meet customer needs and put
excess power onto the grid.

Even though we are in a crisis, we should not postpone accounting for
long-term and unintended consequences of our short-term measures.  Effectiv=
e
energy policy should be based on sound economic principles.  Together, we
can accomplish this.
