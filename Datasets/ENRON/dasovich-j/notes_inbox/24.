Jeff-

This is a guy from South Carolina who works with a bunch of industrial 
customers there.  At the last GridSouth meeting, he cornered Joe Connor and I 
and asked us about California and the price spikes there.  I told him a bunch 
of reasons why the price spikes happened, but it appears that he wants more 
information.

I would appreciate it if you would call him or if you could find someone else 
out there in CA to give him a call.  He is not super sophisticated, but he is 
the representative of some big clients, so I try to keep him happy.  [I think 
he represents Michelin and Nucor steel--two huge energy users in South 
Carolina.]

Thank you very much.

Tom

Do you have a contact in California that I can continue my questioning about
the situation out there?
