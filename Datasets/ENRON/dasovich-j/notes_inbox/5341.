Many of you are using Izio Infopier, the learning management software used in 
a pilot we are conducting this semester.? As with any pilot study, we are in 
a "discovery" phase and we will encounter bugs and process issues that 
require correction.? For example, regarding accounts or access to courses, 
some persons may still have some related issues to resolve.? Because of this, 
some problem routing bottlenecks have occurred, which have introduced delays 
in service in resolving those problems.? HCS wants to ensure the fastest 
response possible for you, our customers.

Here are your (most efficient) support options:

1) FOR FASTEST SERVICE AND ACCESS TO THE FIRST-AVAILABLE PERSON, CONTACT THE 
HCS HELP DESK (510) 642-0434, mailto:helpdesk@haas.berkeley.edu, or at 
https://helpdesk.haas.berkeley.edu.

2) SEE YOUR GRADUATE STUDENT INSTRUCTOR OR TEACHING ASSISTANT FOR THE COURSE.

3) SEE PHIL MAHONEY, KRISTINA VERA, PAZ MELENDEZ, OR JESSE PARAISO IN THE 
STUDENT COMPUTING GROUP, S300A, S300B, S300S.

Haas Computing Services appreciates your participation, cooperation, and 
patience in this pilot of Izio.? We are working with you and with the Izio 
application service provider to resolve issues and to continually improve 
both the product and the user experience as we move forward.

Best,
Zane
