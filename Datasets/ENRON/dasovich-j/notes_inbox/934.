HIPAA - The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
is kicking into high gear. The final rule on National Standards
for Electronic Transactions was published on Aug. 17, 2000 and
the clock is ticking with a compliance date is less than two
years away.  The industry has hardly been vigilant in its prep-
aration, more than 95% of the 800 million doctor/patient en-
counter charges are still captured manually, but healthcare
administrators and executives are planning to spend up to three
times as much getting ready for HIPAA as they did preparing for
Y2K.  Healthcare Outlook 2000 will gather the private companies
best suited to make the most of the HIPAA opportunity.  Last
year the meeting sold out, so register today:
