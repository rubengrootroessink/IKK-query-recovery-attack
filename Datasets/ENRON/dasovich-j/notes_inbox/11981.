Enron files suit in contempt bid
By Emily Bazar
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published July 12, 2001)=20
State legislators pressed forward with contempt findings against Enron Corp=
.=20
on Wednesday after the company failed to produce subpoenaed documents and=
=20
filed a lawsuit asking the court to intervene on its behalf.=20
Lawmakers on a special Senate committee investigating electricity price=20
manipulation warned that the voluminous lawsuit, filed in Sacramento Superi=
or=20
Court, could have far-reaching implications for the Legislature's ability t=
o=20
conduct investigations and make findings. A few even suggested the legal=20
action could trigger "a constitutional crisis" that could end up in the=20
California or U.S. supreme court.=20
"You are treading into the territory of asking a court to make judgment on=
=20
the rules and the law governing the rights of the Legislature," said state=
=20
Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon. "It is a separation of powers issue of the=20
highest order."=20
Representatives from Enron, a power marketer based in Houston, said they ar=
e=20
merely concerned that the committee has violated their due process rights.=
=20
Enron and another company, Mirant, were initially found in contempt by the=
=20
committee June 28 for refusing to turn over thousands of pages of documents=
=20
that had been subpoenaed June 11.=20
But the committee offered the companies a reprieve. If they complied with t=
he=20
subpoenas, signed confidentiality agreements and set up a document deposito=
ry=20
in Sacramento by Tuesday, the contempt findings would be expunged.=20
Committee attorney Laurence Drivon reported at the hearing that Mirant had=
=20
complied with the requirements, and had set up a document depository in the=
=20
U.S. Bank building downtown.=20
Mirant spokesman Patrick Dorinson said 159,000 pages of documents had been=
=20
turned over in 44 boxes as of Wednesday morning.=20
As a result, the panel voted to purge the contempt findings against Mirant,=
=20
but said it would review the company's compliance again in about 30 days.=
=20
Enron, however, did not turn over any documents or sign a confidentiality=
=20
agreement since the last hearing, Drivon said, and negotiations yielded=20
little progress. On a 6-0 vote, the panel agreed to move forward with=20
contempt proceedings against Enron.=20
As early as next week, the committee will forward a report to the Senate,=
=20
which will vote on the contempt findings and levy punishments that could=20
range from jail time for company officials to steep fines.=20
The panel said Enron could still purge the contempt findings if it complies=
=20
with the subpoena before the report is forwarded.=20
But company officials fired back at the committee, accusing members of=20
unfairly singling out Enron and treating it differently from other energy=
=20
companies.=20
"It is exceedingly difficult to discern whether the committee's actions are=
=20
designed to uncover the facts underlying the price spikes in California's=
=20
wholesale electric power market, or to create a convenient political=20
scapegoat to shoulder the blame for California's policy mistakes," one=20
official wrote to the committee.=20
All along, Enron officials have said they have several objections to the=20
committee's process. They believe the panel is violating the Federal Energy=
=20
Regulatory Commission's jurisdiction in its investigation; that it isn't=20
entitled to documents that are stored outside California; and that it doesn=
't=20
have the right to the confidential information and trade secrets in the=20
documents.=20
They also argue that their due process rights have been violated because th=
ey=20
received no response to their written objections to the subpoena before the=
=20
June 28 contempt vote.=20
The committee chairman, Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, overruled most of their=
=20
objections Wednesday. However, Enron officials argued it's unfair for a=20
committee member to rule on their objections.=20
"It is a foregone conclusion that the objections are going to be overruled,=
"=20
Enron lawyer Michael Kirby said at the hearing.=20
Officials believe an impartial third party should determine the merits of=
=20
their concerns, which was a primary reason the company filed the lawsuit,=
=20
said Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne.=20
In the lawsuit, Enron seeks a court injunction to end contempt proceedings=
=20
until the company's objections "have been duly considered and ruled upon by=
=20
an impartial hearing officer."=20
But Dunn said the Legislature's investigations are different from court=20
inquiries, and so are its procedures. "The same due process concerns=20
applicable to a court proceeding are not equally applicable to an=20
investigation by the Legislature," he said.=20
He denied the committee had singled out Enron, and said he believes Enron's=
=20
lawsuit is really asking the court to force the Legislature to end its=20
investigation.=20
The committee is scheduled to consider contempt findings against other powe=
r=20
companies next week.=20
"Enron (has) raised, potentially, a constitutional crisis with this=20
litigation," Dunn said.=20
Constitutional scholar Clark Kelso said legislators clamoring about a=20
constitutional crisis may be exaggerating. But Kelso, a professor at McGeor=
ge=20
School of Law in Sacramento, believes the suit should be dismissed because =
it=20
is premature. He said the contempt process is still under way in the Capito=
l,=20
and has yet to be acted upon by the Senate.=20
Reacting to Enron's claims that an impartial third party should hear its=20
objections, Kelso also disagreed. "A court is not going to hold a Senate=20
committee to the same standard of impartiality it would hold a judge to," h=
e=20
said.=20

Davis' refund plan faces a tough road: Several experts say it's unlikely th=

FERC will buy the state's figures.
By Dale Kasler

(Published July 12, 2001)=20
Gov. Gray Davis' defiant "see you in court" broadside to federal regulators=
=20
this week demonstrates that it's unlikely the regulators will deliver the=
=20
multibillion-dollar refund from wholesale power generators that Davis is=20
demanding.=20
Davis' team limped out of Washington empty-handed Monday, concluding two=20
weeks of fruitless refund negotiations with generators. Instead of the $8.9=
=20
billion he wanted, Davis got a $716 million offer from generators -- and a=
=20
conclusion by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission judge who oversaw th=
e=20
talks that California isn't entitled to anything near $8.9 billion in=20
refunds.=20
Judge Curtis Wagner plans to recommend that FERC hold a full hearing on the=
=20
state's refund claims but said he doubts the refunds would amount to more=
=20
than $1 billion. That sum is so small that Wagner said the refunds would be=
=20
canceled out by the unpaid debts owed to the generators.=20
State officials proclaimed the talks a victory of sorts. The governor's chi=
ef=20
negotiator, Michael Kahn, said "our positions were vindicated" because=20
generators for the first time put refund dollars on the table.=20
The governor says generators and marketers, in violation of a federal law=
=20
setting a "just and reasonable" limit on wholesale electricity prices, have=
=20
routinely overcharged California, plunging the state into a crisis that's=
=20
bankrupted Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and could do the same to Southern=
=20
California Edison.=20
Insisting they've done nothing wrong, generators and marketers said they=20
offered the refunds simply to put the matter behind them.=20
"It was to get rid of the litigation and investigations -- they're a huge=
=20
drag," said Enron Corp. spokesman Mark Palmer. He wouldn't say how much the=
=20
Houston-based marketer had offered.=20
Palmer and several experts said the state faces an uphill battle convincing=
=20
FERC that California is entitled to the mega-refund Davis wants.=20
FERC, which will make the final call on refunds, probably believes it's=20
helped California already by imposing price controls on wholesale=20
electricity, and may not be inclined to order huge refunds, said Larry=20
Foster, editor of the Washington newsletter Inside FERC.=20
"At some point the commission might say, 'We've done all we can do (for=20
California), and if you don't like it, go to court,' which is what the stat=
e=20
is going to do anyway," Foster said.=20
The governor said Tuesday that he will sue FERC if it fails to order $8.9=
=20
billion in refunds. "You order what you think is fair," he said. "We'll tak=
e=20
what you order, and we'll see you in court."=20
Undaunted by the threat, generators and marketers were chortling over remar=
ks=20
by Wagner, who wrapped up the failed settlement talks by saying refunds=20
probably wouldn't top $1 billion.=20
Californians "got hammered" by Wagner, said Enron's Palmer. "The judge told=
=20
them, 'Look, your claim is bogus.'"=20
Wagner has retreated somewhat from his statement, telling the San Jose=20
Mercury News that he isn't sure what the final numbers would be.=20
Sources have said that at one point in the talks, he suggested a $4.5 billi=
on=20
refund -- including $2 billion in cash and $2 billion in discounts on=20
long-term power contracts. But it wasn't clear how seriously anyone took th=
at=20
proposal, and as the talks wound down the judge was clearly dismissive of t=
he=20
state's insistence on getting $8.9 billion.=20
Experts say FERC probably will hold the formal hearing and employ a formula=
=20
Wagner recommended for calculating the refunds -- a formula that spells goo=
d=20
and bad news for both sides.=20
For one thing, Wagner will likely urge a formula based on the price-control=
=20
system FERC implemented last month -- something that could work to=20
California's advantage. The controls limit prices to a ceiling based on the=
=20
production costs of the least-efficient power generator in California.=20
But Wagner's plan would calculate production costs differently than FERC ha=
s=20
so far. He would employ a system that's significantly more favorable to the=
=20
generators, said John Stout, senior vice president with power generator=20
Reliant Energy Inc.=20
Also, Wagner would ignore alleged overcharges prior to last October. That=
=20
alone could wipe out about $2.9 billion in potential refunds, according to=
=20
the Independent System Operator, which runs California's power grid.=20
Suppliers say a full accounting of costs, particularly the skyrocketing=20
natural gas expenses, will show the prices they charged were fair. "The mor=
e=20
days of testimony you have, the stronger Wagner's case becomes, the=20
weaker-looking Davis' case becomes," said Enron's Palmer.=20
Nonetheless, California officials said a hearing could produce a refund in=
=20
excess of $1 billion.=20
"Any reasonable calculation is going to give you a much higher number than=
=20
that," said Severin Borenstein of the University of California Energy=20
Institute.=20

Energy Digtest: UC, CSU, Enron extend contract

Energy consultants failed to file disclosures, Jones says
By Amy Chance
Bee Political Editor
(Published July 12, 2001)=20
The Davis administration failed to abide by state ethics laws as it hired 4=
5=20
outside consultants to help the state cope with the electricity crisis,=20
Secretary of State Bill Jones charged Wednesday.=20
While such consultants are required to file statements of economic interest=
s=20
-- reports of outside income that might represent a financial conflict with=
=20
their responsibilities for the state -- Jones said a check by his aides=20
Monday found that none of them had filed the documents.=20
Although the administration began hiring consultants in January, Jones aide=
s=20
said they were told that the state Department of Water Resources -- which h=
as=20
handled the state's electricity-buying efforts -- only recently became awar=
e=20
that the reports were necessary.=20
Jones released a copy of a June 15 memo in which the department notified=20
energy contractors that they were required to file the statement and=20
disqualify themselves from decisions that could affect their financial=20
interests. The memo was written one day after Jones demanded that two of Go=
v.=20
Gray Davis' consultants, Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani, file=20
conflict-of-interest forms.=20
"It's a sad commentary when an administration only decides to comply with=
=20
ethics and anti-corruption laws after their violations have been exposed,"=
=20
Jones, a Republican who wants to challenge Democrat Davis for governor next=
=20
year, said at a Capitol news conference. "I am also deeply concerned that=
=20
when filed, the statements of economic interests will show that a number of=
=20
consultants have illegally engaged in policy discussions and decisions that=
=20
affect their personal finances."=20
Davis press secretary Steven Maviglio said Wednesday that all consultants=
=20
required to file the statement had done so or would do so within the requir=
ed=20
30-day time period. But he was unable to produce any of the statements,=20
saying they would first have to be reviewed to remove home addresses and=20
other personal information.=20
Information provided by the state Fair Political Practices Commission on it=
s=20
Web site states that the forms are public records that state agencies must=
=20
make available for "public inspection or reproduction during regular busine=
ss=20
hours no later than the second business day after they are received."=20
Jones called on state Attorney General Bill Lockyer to investigate what he=
=20
called the administration's "blatant disregard for the state's=20
full-disclosure and conflict-of-interest laws." A Lockyer spokeswoman said=
=20
the attorney general would consider the request.=20
Maviglio noted that the statements, which fall under the purview of the FPP=
C,=20
are not Jones' responsibility as secretary of state. He said Jones is "on a=
=20
witch hunt on something outside his jurisdiction."=20
Jones said if consultants involved in negotiating billions of dollars worth=
=20
of contracts with electricity generators had financial conflicts, the publi=
c=20
has a right to know.=20
"The governor's insistence on secrecy throughout the energy crisis has=20
prompted increased public cynicism of their government," Jones said.=20

Fudging at FERC: Feds must define 'just' energy charges


(Published July 12, 2001)=20

The economists say that some of the record-high electricity prices that hav=
e=20
plagued California in the past 14 months are the result of generators and=
=20
traders exploiting flaws in a dysfunctional market to exert market power ov=
er=20
prices. The problem is that federal regulators have been slow to wake up to=
=20
reality and exert some power of their own to enforce the law.=20
The Federal Power Act is supposed to protect the public by keeping prices f=
or=20
electricity "just" and "reasonable." With price limitations now in place=20
going into the future, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has done on=
ly=20
half of its job. Now it must do the other half by reviewing and remedying t=
he=20
abuses of the past.=20
Gov. Gray Davis estimates that generators have overcharged California to th=
e=20
tune of about $9 billion. Generators and traders, on the other hand, have=
=20
suggested refunding something less than $1 billion. Efforts at a settlement=
=20
have gone nowhere. So now FERC must settle the score, even if it means a=20
trial-like proceeding that puts the last year under a microscope, one=20
questionable transaction at a time.=20
While much of the political focus has been on price, the job of the=20
regulators is to consider both price and circumstance. An unjust transactio=
n=20
is born out of broken market conditions, when the buyer has little choice b=
ut=20
to accept the price of seller who can move the market by his own actions.=
=20
When the price exceeds by many multiples the actual cost to produce power,=
=20
there is compelling reason to look for gouging.=20
Undoubtedly, there were times over the last year when generators and trader=
s=20
weren't gouging California, as evidenced by records of some transaction=20
recently released by the state. During the winter when the price of natural=
=20
gas (the state's primary fuel for electricity) was high, there's a reasonab=
le=20
explanation for high power prices. Yet last fall and last summer, when=20
natural gas was cheaper yet electricity was outrageously expensive, there's=
=20
reason to doubt that the market was working reasonably.=20
Reviewing the prices charged in the last year is a test case for FERC, one=
=20
that it has sought to avoid. It requires FERC to concede that it was not on=
=20
alert as California ventured into the uncharted world of deregulation.=20
Yet the future of electricity competition in California, and perhaps the=20
nation, depends on the federal government showing that it is able and willi=
ng=20
to do its duty to protect the public from unfair market conditions. Settlin=
g=20
this score also affects the math of potential deals to put Pacific Gas and=
=20
Electric and Southern California Edison back on their feet. The refund that=
=20
Californians are owed is likely somewhere between those $1 billion and $9=
=20
billion estimates. It's time for FERC to go find out the right amount.=20

State energy contracts must be paid off by users in system By Ed Mendel =20
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER  July 12, 2001  SACRAMENTO -- California=20
businesses are being hit by big electricity rate increases, some as high as=
=20
100 percent, and they would like to be able to shop around for cheaper=20
power.  But state regulators are poised to ban customer choice, or "direct=
=20
access" as it has come to be called, because they want to make sure that=20
enough customers remain with utilities to pay for state power purchases. =
=20
After a month of closed-door talks, the revelation that the state has signe=
d=20
$43 billion worth of long-term power contracts at above-market prices helpe=
d=20
scuttle an attempt to work out a compromise in the Assembly.=20
"If the intent of the big customers is to leave the small customers paying=
=20
for those contracts, we are going to fight like hell," said Lenny Goldberg,=
 a=20
lobbyist for The Utility Reform Network.=20
Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology=20
Association, said large business users were offering to pay off the back de=
bt=20
of Southern California Edison, estimated at $3.5 billion, in exchange for=
=20
direct access.=20
"I thought we were making a lot of progress until the information on the=20
contracts came out," Stewart said. "We really don't have a way of dealing=
=20
with those contracts."=20
Now Stewart is suggesting that direct access be slowly phased in over a=20
period of years and that the long-term power contracts be renegotiated,=20
perhaps with some being switched from the state to big-business users.=20
The manufacturers association and the California Chamber of Commerce helped=

Huntington Loses Battle on Generators
Power: AES receives go-ahead to restart two shut-down units without a=20

TIMES STAFF WRITER

July 12 2001

The California Energy Commission on Wednesday voted to allow giant power=20
company AES to move ahead with plans to restart two mothballed generators i=
n=20
Huntington Beach even without the company's guarantee that it would sell th=
e=20
electricity within the state.

The decision permits AES to begin operating the generators next month.

The 3-1 vote marks a defeat for Huntington Beach, which had agreed to AES'=
=20
plans only with the company's pledge that all electricity generated would b=
e=20
used to ease the state's power crisis. In granting approval, energy=20
commissioners conceded that the deal does not come without potential harm t=
o=20
the environment.

"We do not know the extent of the plant's contribution to the transport of=
=20
bacteria to the beach, which can result in beach closures and the loss of=
=20
recreational opportunities to beach visitors and commercial opportunities t=
o=20
local merchants," the ruling says.

State officials said they decided to drop the restriction that AES sell pow=
er=20
within California to avoid more delays and help fulfill Gov. Gray Davis'=20
executive order that the state significantly boost power production over th=
e=20
next year.

"It adds power that will make California's power grid more secure, and the=
=20
more power we can get, the more secure we are from rolling blackouts," said=
=20
energy commission spokesman Rob Schlichting.

AES originally agreed to the restriction. But the company demanded that it =
be=20
dropped after negotiations with the state over long-term energy contracts=
=20
broke down in June.

With no contracts, AES argued it should have the right to sell power produc=
ed=20
in Huntington Beach to whomever it wants.

Huntington Beach officials who lobbied hard for the sales restriction said=
=20
they felt betrayed by the decision.

They said the commission bowed to the demands of a corporation over local=
=20
concerns.

"AES got exactly what it wanted," said City Councilwoman Connie Boardman, w=
ho=20
testified at the hearing.

"There's a lot of impacts the residents of Huntington Beach put up with. Th=
e=20
energy crisis is the reason this project was approved so rapidly. Now that=
=20
seems irrelevant. I think it's a big waste of time."

An AES spokesman said the company would prefer to sell its power to custome=
rs=20
in California. But he acknowledged there is no guarantee the extra=20
electricity will remain in the state.

Councilwoman Debbie Cook said she fully expects AES to sell the power to=20
out-of-state companies.

"They're going to sell it where they can get the most money," Cook said.

"If they can sell it outside the state and resell it at a higher rate, then=
=20
that's what they're going to do."

The two 40-year-old generators, which have been out of service since 1995,=

can produce enough power to supply 337,500 homes and represent almost 10% o=

AES said the retooling of Unit 3 is 75% complete and it should be on line b=
y=20
Aug. 7, and Unit 4 is 70% complete and could come on line a week later.

AES had also requested a 10-year license to operate the generators.

But the commission on Wednesday sided with Huntington Beach on that point.

The city lobbied for a five-year license and a five-year renewal if the=20
company complies with a host of laws and regulations.=20

Enron Gets 2nd Chance to Turn Over Documents
Energy: State Senate panel gives the electricity seller a way around a=20
contempt citation. But the company balks.
CARL INGRAM
TIMES STAFF WRITER

July 12 2001

SACRAMENTO -- Acting five hours after Enron Corp. sued to stop a legislativ=
e=20
investigation of its business practices, a state Senate committee Wednesday=
=20
gave the electricity wholesaler a second chance to turn over documents and=
=20
rid itself of a contempt citation.

But officials at Enron, a major player in the California power market,=20
brushed aside the gesture, saying it fell far short of meeting the company'=
s=20
objections.

"Our position has not changed. . . . The issues we had at the beginning of=
=20
the hearing, we still had at the conclusion of the hearing," spokeswoman=20
Karen Denne said. The Houston-based electricity wholesaler claimed in a=20
letter to the Senate investigative committee that it was being singled out =
as=20
a "political scapegoat" for the energy mistakes of California officials.

In the suit, Enron charged that the committee's investigation went far=20
outside the law, an allegation denied by Chairman Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana). H=
e=20
also denied the scapegoat charge.

The lawsuit was filed in Superior Court 62 minutes before the select=20
committee investigating market manipulation was to finalize its earlier=20
finding of contempt against Enron.

Enron appears to be the last of eight power sellers to refuse to make=20
documents available to the committee. Seven others also had held out, but i=
n=20
the last two weeks have said they will provide the records or are negotiati=
ng=20
to do so.

Dunn said the committee must examine the hundreds of thousands of documents=
,=20
including what Enron called its "most closely guarded secrets," to determin=
e=20
whether price gouging occurred and whether remedial legislation is necessar=
y.

Gov. Gray Davis and other officials are convinced that the wholesalers=20
overcharged the state $8.9 billion during the energy crisis. A federal=20
mediator has said the overcharges are closer to $1 billion.

But at Wednesday's hearing, an angry Sen. Steve Peace (D-El Cajon), a spons=
or=20
of California's flawed 1996 deregulation law, charged that by suing the=20
committee, Enron was trying to "precipitate a constitutional crisis" betwee=
n=20
the judicial and legislative branches of state government.

"You just went to war with the state of California and the people of=20
California!" Peace shouted at Michael Kirby, a San Diego attorney=20
representing Enron. "You are already at war economically. Now you are at wa=
r=20
politically."

Kirby replied that Enron was merely trying to defend its right to due proce=
ss=20
against what he called unlawful violations by the committee.

He complained that Enron was held in contempt on June 28 but that the compa=
ny=20
had never been given a chance to present its objections.

"An accused criminal has been given more opportunity to have a hearing on=
=20
their objections than I have [in this committee]," Kirby told the lawmakers=
.

Sen. Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey), also an attorney, told Kirby that=20
legislative subpoenas are far different than those issued in the court syst=
em=20
and are not subject to the same restrictions because lawmakers must deal wi=
th=20
policy issues, not matters of guilt or innocence.

In their suit and testimony to the committee, Enron representatives charged=
=20
the committee had ventured far out of its jurisdiction and that only the=20
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission could legally undertake a wholesale=20
price investigation and impose sanctions.

The committee asked for a vast array of documents, including those involvin=
g=20
business decisions and transactions in other states. But Enron claimed that=
=20
the committee had no authority to issue subpoenas outside California and th=

the subpoenas themselves were flawed.

The company asked the court for an injunction against further investigation=
=20
by the committee and proposed that a "neutral" arbitrator or judge try to=
=20
fashion a compromise.

Dunn suggested that the lawsuit was an effort to intimidate the committee.=
=20
But he insisted it "will not impact our investigation."

Under contempt procedures, last used in 1929, the committee can find an=20
individual or entity in contempt. It then reports its recommendations to th=
e=20
full Senate, which must ratify the committee's action. The Senate also can=
=20
impose sanctions, ranging from possible jail terms to heavy penalties.

Dunn offered Enron what he called a "middle ground" that would give the=20
company an opportunity to change its mind and comply with the subpoenas=20
instead of facing an immediate report to the Senate.

Under Dunn's recommendation, approved on a bipartisan 5-0 vote, the report =
of=20
Enron's failure to comply would be compiled and written, but it would not b=
e=20
delivered to the full Senate until Monday at the earliest.

If Enron were to reverse itself and agree to provide the records the=20
committee wants, sign a confidentiality agreement and create a Sacramento=
=20
repository for its records, the committee would hold the report back.

If compliance continued, Dunn said, the committee's contempt finding would =
be=20
purged.

Dunn said he decided to give Enron a second chance because his "No. 1=20
priority is to get the documents. Contempt is the last resort."

Denne, the Enron spokeswoman, noted that the company recently established a=
=20
document repository in Sacramento for records of its California operations,=
=20
but not the disputed documents involving business elsewhere.

She contended that the confidentiality agreements proposed by the committee=
=20
failed to "guarantee that these documents would remain confidential."

Another wholesaler, Mirant, also had been held in contempt by the committee=

uncertainty.=20
One of the main reasons for doubts about coal as a commodity is that it has=
=20
little history of wide price fluctuations, a key ingredient in bringing=20
together buyers and sellers. And of the roughly 1 billion tons of coal burn=
ed=20
in the United States annually, 80 percent is bought through long-term=20

Skeptics also contend that the exchange is overestimating the industry's ne=

But those assumptions were under assault as Nymex's Central Appalachian=20

Sacramento -- In another escalation in the war between California and=20
out-of-state energy providers, Enron Corp. filed a lawsuit yesterday=20
challenging the Legislature's authority to subpoena company documents.=20
The suit came as a Senate panel investigating market manipulation voted 6 t=
o=20
0 to move forward with a contempt motion against Enron. A report will be=20
forwarded to the full Senate early next week if the marketer continues to=
=20
refuse to comply with the subpoena.=20
"You just went to war with the state of California," Sen. Steve Peace, D-El=
=20
Cajon, told the lawyer representing Enron. ". . . You already initiated a w=
ar=20
economically; now you're in a political war."=20
The Senate committee investigating price manipulation found Enron and Miran=
t=20
Corp. in contempt last month for not turning over subpoenaed documents. The=
=20
finding against Mirant was vacated yesterday because it agreed to turn over=
=20
documents.=20
The committee, chaired by Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, requested documents=
=20
from power providers in early April. When the requests were ignored, the=20
committee issued subpoenas asking generators for documents covering busines=
s=20
plans, operations, risk management and investment strategies.=20
Peace argued that forcing a judge to decide the scope of the Legislature's=
=20
authority could provoke a constitutional crisis.=20
"You are treading into the territory of asking the court to make judgment o=
n=20
the rules and the law governing the rights of the Legislature," Peace said.=
=20
"It is a separation of powers issue of the highest order."=20
But Michael Kirby, a lawyer hired by Enron, said the Houston company was=20
simply looking for due process.=20
"A subpoena is a subpoena and once you go that route you must comply with t=
he=20
law," he told the committee. "We are entitled to some kind of hearing with =
a=20
neutral arbitrator. It was not our preference to file a lawsuit."=20
Kirby and the lawsuit cite several objections to the Senate's subpoena. The=
se=20
include the confidentiality of the documents and whether a California body=
=20
can require documents from outside the state. Enron also says that only=20
federal regulators have the power to subpoena their records.=20
Kirby and members of the committee disagreed over the scope of what a=20
legislative subpoena covers versus one used in a criminal matter.=20
"I think there is a fundamental misunderstanding about our legislative=20
inquiry," Dunn said. "We are not drawing conclusions about guilt or=20
innocence. We want to see what fixes must be made in the law."=20
Kirby did say Enron has set up a depository in Sacramento and has 30,000=20
documents ready to be deposited, pending an agreement can be reached on=20
confidentiality issues.=20
But that is not good enough for committee members, who believe that Enron h=
as=20

PUC Chairwoman Loretta Lynch promptly said she was exasperated by the=20

Dropping the voltage carried by power lines by as little as 2.5 percent was=

But lawyers for PG&E filed a 10-page document with the commission on Tuesda=

"While some further voltage reductions can be made, substantial additional=

According to Wattenburg, the two big Southern California utilities could sa=

additional 200 to 300 megawatts. Total electricity consumption throughout t=

The concept of lowering power line voltages in an attempt to save energy ha=

controversial.=20
Michael O'Hare, an engineer and professor of public policy at the Universit=
y=20

reductions "are precisely zero" when they are applied to refrigerators,=20
air conditioners or "anything else controlled by a thermostat" because they=

would merely run a little longer than they do with full voltage.=20
"In sum," O'Hare said in a recent comment to The Chronicle, "the promised=

PG&E promised hundreds of megawatts in savings within a month, but in paper=

But Lynch misunderstood PG&E's comments, according to Les Guliasi, the=20

In a move that pushes the nation farther down the path of deregulating its=
=20
power systems, federal energy regulators yesterday ordered that transmissio=
n=20
grids in the Northeast and Southeast be combined to form regional systems.=
=20
The decision represents a victory for marketing companies that buy, sell an=
d=20
trade electricity. Power marketers such as Enron, based in Houston, which=
=20
have created a new kind of business buying power where it is abundant and=
=20
selling it where it is scarce, had fought for creation of the regional=20
systems.=20
They argued that utility ownership created a costly barrier to entry in man=
y=20
markets and that more regional systems would better enable them to transmit=
=20
power over longer distances.=20
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has been slowly nudging power=20
interests toward the regional systems for two years. Yesterday, in a sudden=
=20
and aggressive demonstration of its intent, the commission ordered three=20
independent system operators covering 12 Northeastern states to form one=20
regional transmission group, and ordered four utilities in the Southeast,=
=20
including Southern Co. and Entergy, to form another system.=20
Under the latest federal orders, utilities that own or control power lines=
=20
will have to turn them over to nonprofit groups called regional transmissio=
n=20
organizations that will manage them. The groups would set rules for the=20
regional market systems and facilitate easier transmission of power across=
=20
state lines.=20
A similar move has been proposed in California, but California power grid=

managers and utilities have resisted it, saying the market in the state is=

Voltage cut won't work, PG&E warns=20

In a move that blindsided state regulators, Pacific Gas & Electric official=
s=20
have raised serious concerns about a novel plan to conserve energy by=20
reducing the voltage sent into homes and businesses.=20
Company officials told the Public Utilities Commission this week that its=

electric distribution system is already operating at a low voltage level an=

that any energy savings would fall short of expectations.=20
What is more, company officials said they would not be able to complete the=

voltage changes for three months -- too late to help the state if hot summe=

At the urging of Gov. Gray Davis, the PUC was to consider today changing it=
s=20
regulations to allow utilities to lower their voltage, possibly starting th=

month.=20
Officials said they were stunned to receive a filing from PG&E Tuesday=20
afternoon raising concerns about the proposal. Scientists, the PUC and=20
utilities have been working on the voltage reduction plan for more than a=
=20
month, and PG&E voiced no major concerns before now, PUC officials said.=20
``It's quite unfortunate that even though we had a cooperative process . . =

those concerns were not submitted earlier,'' said PUC President Loretta=20
Lynch. ``It's derailed at this point so we can be serious about addressing=
=20
PG&E's concerns.''=20

The change, championed by scientist and talk show host Bill Wattenberg, wou=

crank down the voltage on the state's electrical grid from about 120 volts =
to=20
117 volts, a drop of about 2.5 percent.=20
State officials expected the reduction to go unnoticed by most users and to=
=20
conserve about 500 megawatts of power during peak periods -- enough to=20
possibly spare the state from blackouts on high-demand days.=20
About half that energy savings was expected to come from PG&E customers. Bu=
t=20
in their filing with the PUC, utility officials said their system is=20
``already operating at the lowest voltages possible'' under current=20
regulations. The company said that, at most, it could probably reduce load =
by=20
about 40 megawatts.=20
``We are operating at the low end of the system,'' said Les Guliasi, direct=
or=20
of regulatory relations for the utility. ``We've been very up front and fra=
nk=20
with what we could achieve with these savings.''=20
Lynch's energy adviser, Robert Kinosian, said 40 megawatts is ``significant=
ly=20
lower than what they said before.''=20
``If 40 megawatts is all we're going to get, should we even take the time t=
o=20
do it?'' Kinosian said.=20
Southern California Edison officials also said their reductions would be=20
lower than state officials expected. John Ballance, director of network=20
engineering for Edison, said Wednesday the utility could probably shave 100=
=20
to 150 megawatts off its load with the lower voltage.=20
Disputing numbers=20
PG&E spokesman John Nelson said the utilities have insisted all along that=
=20
the 500-megawatt savings touted by Davis and others was unreasonable.=20
``All the utilities have disputed that number,'' he said.=20
Wattenberg, who has been helping PG&E test the voltage reduction idea, said=
=20
he doubted the utility was operating at the low end of the voltage range.=
=20
``That's funny,'' Wattenberg said from his Sierra home. ``I'm sitting here=
=20
with 122 volts.''=20
Kinosian said the PUC would study PG&E's concerns and might send inspectors=
=20
out to test the utility's system. If necessary, he said, state regulators=
=20
could go ahead with the reductions elsewhere in the state.=20

Regulators Order Formation of Big Grids
To Optimize the Flow of Electricity in U.S.

The commission said it wants utilities and independent grid operators in th=

orders for the Midwest and the West.=20
The federal orders are intended to accelerate development of=20
electric-transmission organizations that the FERC endorsed in a landmark=20
decision called Order 2000 issued in December 1999. In that order, the FERC=
=20
urged utilities to voluntarily surrender control of their transmission=20

In addition, formation of regional transmission organizations, or RTOs, wou=

Commissioner William Massey described yesterday's directives as a "watershe=

=20
utilities want to do."=20
The FERC orders likely will face resistance in the Southeast, where states=
=20
haven't deregulated their retail electricity markets and where fear of=20
federal control is particularly acute. "My guess is that those states will=
=20
say, `We're happy with what we've got and with keeping control over our own=
=20
utilities,'" said Frank Wolak, an economics professor and power-markets=20
expert at Stanford University. "Any state that surrenders control to FERC,=
=20
after what's happened in California , isn't thinking clearly."=20
The directive also creates big problems for existing grid-running=20
organizations that thought they already were doing what the agency wanted.=
=20
Currently, New York, New England and the mid-Atlantic states each are=20
represented by separate, nonprofit independent system operators, or ISOs,=
=20
that operate transmission systems still owned by local utilities. PJM=20
Interconnection LLC, which controls power flows in the mid-Atlantic region,=

is regarded as having the best market structure. The FERC said it intends t=

organization.=20
That upsets the plans of the other two operators that have been working wit=

=20
suppliers to schedule power flows across all three ISO areas. Such a virtua=

Carol Murphy, spokeswoman for the New York ISO, said attempts to smooth out=

Some market watchers had expected the FERC to compel utilities to surrender=
=20
operational control of their power lines to the independent operators by De=
c.=20

that approach seemed slow and wasteful. "These organizations aren't cheap t=
