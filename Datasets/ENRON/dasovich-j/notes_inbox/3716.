LONDON -(Dow Jones)- U.S. energy group Enron has mandated Schroder Salomon 
Smith Barney as bookrunner for a multi-currency credit-linked notes trust 
transaction. 
The transaction will consist of tranches in intermediate maturities. A launch 
will follow a European roadshow, subject to market conditions.
UBS Warburg will be joint lead manager.

LONDON, May 2 (Reuters) - Enron Credit Linked Notes Trust has mandated 
Salomon Smith Barney and UBS Warburg to lead manage a multi-currency 
transaction, the banks said on Wednesday. The issue will consist of tranches 
in intermediate maturities and will be launched following investor 
presentations in Europe.

Enron to Sell Credit-Linked Notes in Several Currencies

     London, May 2 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. plans to raise money
by selling credit-linked notes in several currencies, according to
Salomon Smith Barney, which will manage the sale with UBS Warburg.
     The sale will follow presentations to investors in Europe and
will consist of issues of intermediate maturities, Salomon said in
a faxed statement. Investors usually regard notes maturing in five
to seven years to be intermediate maturities. Salomon declined to
provide details on the size or timing of the sale.
     Credit-linked notes are typically backed by a pool of assets
owned by the issuer. The payments on the notes are often linked to
the creditworthiness of those assets.
     Houston-based Enron has branched out from its gas pipeline
business to include trading in financial contracts such as gas and
electricity futures and derivatives on corporate bankruptcies.
     Enron owns $65 billion in assets, including 32,000 miles of
pipeline that span 21 states and transport 15 percent of all of
the natural gas consumed in the U.S. Other assets include an
18,000-mile fiber-optic network in the U.S. and 51 power plants
and other energy projects in 15 countries.
     Last week Enron agreed to cancel its $3.1 billion sale of
Portland General Electric Co. to Sierra Pacific Resources, after
both companies decided the California energy crisis had made it
too hard to win approval. The state of California has banned power
plant sales by utilities until 2006 amid an electricity shortage.
     Southern California Edison and PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas &
Electric Co., California's two largest utilities, have run up more
than $14 billion in debt from buying power at soaring prices. The
two utilities are nearly insolvent.
     Enron has $15.8 billion in bonds outstanding, of which $2.7
billion mature this year, according to Bloomberg figures. Enron is
rated ``BBB+'' by Standard & Poor's and ``Baa1'' by Moody's
Investors Service.

Saudi Gas Proj Consortia Seen Selected 2H May -Sources

DUBAI -(Dow Jones)- Consortium leaders and members for the three core gas 
ventures on offer in Saudi Arabia are expected to be announced in the second 
half of May, sources familiar with the negotiating process have told Dow 
Jones Newswires. 
As previously reported, the Saudi Arabian committee negotiating with 
international oil companies, or IOCs, on the so called Gas Initiative, 
recently submitted its proposals for consortium leaders to the kingdom's 
Supreme Petroleum Council for approval.
Saudi Arabia invited international oil companies in October 1998 to 
participate in proposals for downstream gas projects and upstream gas 
enhancement. A series of meetings between the negotiating committee and 
shortlisted IOC's have taken place in the past year. 
Royal Dutch/Shell Group (RD), BP Amoco PLC (BP), Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron 
(CHV), TotalFinaElf (TOT) and ENI SpA (E) have been shortlisted for core 
venture number one, the $15 billion South Ghawar Area Development. Exxon, 
Shell and BP have been dubbed as the frontrunners with ExxonMobil seen as the 
strongest contender. 
For core venture two, the Red Sea Development, Enron Corp. (ENE) and 
Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) are bidding jointly and Exxon Mobil, 
TotalfinaElf, Marathon Oil Canada Inc. (T.M), Shell and Conoco Inc. (COCA) 
have also been listed. Among these, TotalfinaElf and Shell are seen as strong 
possibilities. 
For core venture three, the Shaybah area, TotalFinaElf, Conoco, Phillips 
Petroleum (P), Enron & Occidental, Exxon Mobil, Shell and Marathon Oil have 
been listed. Conoco and TotalfinaElf are said to be frontrunners here. 
Role Of Consortium Leaders Still Unclear 
Sources have said some companies currently under consideration will be struck 
off the list in the final selection. 
Consortium leaders are expected to be responsible for directing further 
detailed negotiations on the projects at hand, such as pricing and finance. 
They are also likely to get the largest stake in any project as well as 
operatorship. 
But the IOCs are still in the dark as to what their exact roles will be in 
the event they are selected, industry sources said. 
Still, despite lacking a comprehensive framework, some deals are expected to 
be initialed this year. And once sealed, IOCs are also expected to start 
talking to local companies about contracting out participation on parts of 
the projects. 
The three ventures have a combined value of about $25 billion with each one 
having on average eight individual components. How these components will be 
dealt with or allocated is also as yet undetermined. 
Saudi Arabia has about 2.5 billion cubic feet of gas a day in its system 
currently and will have about 4 bcf/day by 2003. 
By 2025, it will need an estimated 14 bcf/day to meet its own consumption 
requirements and for possible export.

USA: Enron says no plans to sell Dabhol stake
By C. Bryson Hull

05/02/2001
Reuters English News Service 
(C) Reuters Limited 2001. 

HOUSTON, May 1 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. has no immediate plans to sell its 
stake in the troubled $2.9 billion Dabhol power project in western India, the 
energy giant's chairman said on Tuesday. 

"We're not in any discussion right now on selling the plant," Enron Chairman 
Kenneth Lay told reporters after the company's annual meeting. He did not say 
whether the company planned to sell the project in the future.
Enron has said in the past that it is unlikely to sell the plant until its 
payment disputes are resolved. 
"The lenders have sent the government of India a letter indicating the 
various things both the government of Maharashtra and the government of India 
need to do to come back into compliance with the contract." 
The Houston-based company and the government of the western state of 
Maharashtra have been locked in a payment battle for months, with the state's 
electricity board balking at paying Enron what it considers too high a rate 
for electricity. 
The fight is also now with the national government of India, which is 
contractually bound to cover defaulted payments by Maharashtra, but has since 
changed that position. 
At present, Maharashtra's State Electricity Board (MSEB) owes the Dabhol 
Power Plant, of which Enron is a 65 percent stakeholder, some $48 million for 
power. 
The Dabhol project, the single largest foreign investment in India, consists 
of two phases, the already-built 740 megawatt power plant and a 1,444 MW 
plant that is expected to be finished this year. 
The second phase could be finished later if the payment issue remains 
unresolved, Lay said. 
"The construction activity is being scaled down, so it is impacting 
operations, but its still not too late to stop any damage from that if the 
governments step up and honor the contracts," he said. 
Last week, Dabhol's board authorized the plant's managing director to issue a 
preliminary notice of termination of service to MSEB. The notice, which has 
not been issued, would be the first step for Enron to pull out of the project.
Both governments have a few more weeks to respond to the letter from the 
creditors, Lay said. Enron has already declared political force majeure, a 
legal maneuver that allows a party to break a contract because of situations 
beyond their control, such as coups or civil war. 
India can ill-afford the very public fight Dabhol has become, Lay said. 
"It sends a very bad signal to the rest of the world as to the difficulties 
of investing in India, which is not what India needs right now," Lay said. 
India needs a lof of foreign investment if the country expects to build up 
its infrastructure, he said. 
Indian Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha on Monday told Reuters "there is no 
need for us to think that because there is a problem with Enron it is 
necessarily going to act as a dampener to foreign direct investment."



Centre spikes plan to fix Enron
Vinu Lal

The Times of India 
Copyright (C) 2001 The Times of India; Source: World Reporter (TM) 
MUMBAI: This one would have turned the table in favour of Maharashtra State 
Electricity Board (MSEB), only if the Centre had not opposed it. Even before 
the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) board meeting that took place in London on 
April 25, MSEB was readying with a termination notice intended to be slapped 
on Enron just in case. 
But both the Union ministries, of power and finance, struck down MSEB's 
termination notice plan. Sources confirmed that the board was legally advised 
to prepare a termination notice citing contractual default and that the MSEB 
chairman, Vinay Bansal had duly signed the notice. 
But in a marathon meeting between Union minister of power, Suresh Prabhu and 
finance minister, Yashwant Sinha on April 23, MSEB officials were advised not 
to act in haste as it would precipitate the issue.
However, sources added that if MSEB had slapped the notice first, then the 
liquidated damages payable by the board would have been considerably less 
vis-a-vis the situation prevailing now where Enron has authorised the 
management to issue termination notice. 
``It is still not clear why the Centre spiked the board's plan to issue a 
termination notice since they had a valid point in issuing the same citing 
the penalty of Rs 401 crore for misdeclaration of power. If Enron cites 
non-payment as a default, they are also liable to face termination for 
defaulting by misdeclaring their plant's capacity,'' sources added. 
Interestingly on April 22, Mr Prabhu was advised by the Shiv Sena leader, Bal 
Thackeray, on the issue where he was requested not to dump the project on 
Maharashtra. Since the project has sovereign guarantee of the Indian 
government, it was mandatory that the Union ministries of finance and power 
to clear the proposal of issuing a termination notice. 
The Cabinet sub-committee of the government of Maharashtra, which met thrice 
recently, had finalised the notice under Schedule 17.2 of the power purchase 
agreement, where the contracted party (Enron) has not obliged to PPA 
conditions citing the penalty issue. 
When contacted Vinay Bansal refused to comment on the issue where the Centre 
scuttled MSEB's plans. Legal sources associated with the board confirmed that 
under Section 17 of the power purchase agreement, MSEB had prepared a 
termination notice in retaliation to the drastic steps Enron was resorting to 
after payment defaults.




India's Dabhol Pwr Co: Naphtha Supply Remains Regular

Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- U.S. energy major Enron Corp.'s (ENE) India unit, 
Dabhol Power Co., is continuing to receive regular supplies of naphtha, a DPC 
official told Dow Jones Newswires Wednesday. The US$3 billion Dabhol power 
project has been mired in financial disputes since its main customer, the 
Maharashtra State Electricity Board, failed to pay several of its bills.
The dispute has raised concerns about the regularity of DPC's naphtha supply. 
"We have a term agreement with Indian Oil Corp. (IOC) for the supply of 
naphtha until the end of this year," he said. He added that the plant will 
switch from naphtha to liquified natural gas as a fuel source in 2002. 
"I confirm that one or two shipments of naphtha are coming every month. Each 
shipment is carrying about 30,000 metric tons of naphtha. Shipments come 
depending on the power that Maharashtra State Electricity Board draws," 
hesaid. 
The naphtha is sourced from IOC's Gujarat refinery. 
A committee appointed to renegotiate the MSEB's power purchase agreement with 
the DPC will hold its first meeting with DPC management May 5, the Press 
Trust of India reported Tuesday. 
Dabhol has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power. 
Critics object to Dabhol charging INR7.1 a kilowatt-hour for its power, 
compared with INR1.5/KWh charged by other suppliers.

Maharashtra Electricity Board unamused by new Enron demand
Mahesh Vijapurkar

05/02/2001

Copyright (C) 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd (KSL); Source: World Reporter (TM) - 
Asia Intelligence Wire 
MUMBAI, MAY 1. The Enron-sponsored Dabhol Power Company (DPC) appears to have 
adopted a twin-track approach - threaten withdrawal by terminating the power 
purchase agreement (PPA) and simultaneously asking the Maharashtra State 
Electricity Board (MSEB) to activate some features of the same accord. 
Just days before its board of directors met in London and authorised the 
local management to decide when the PPA should be terminated, the DPC asked 
the MSEB to operationalise the escrow agreement. This, sources said, was a 
bid to confuse issues by sending contradictory signals.
An unamused MSEB shot off a letter saying the DPC, by invoking its rights 
under a force majeure clause enabling it to suspend the PPA, could not now 
ask for operationalising the escrow agreement. It had to be either of the two 
options, not both. 
Under an amended and restated accord, signed in March 1999, specific revenue 
collection centres of the MSEB were identified and collections from these 
would have to be lodged into a separate account in an identified bank; the 
cover had to be 1.25 times the monthly billing of the 1,444 mw phase II. 
Already, the escrow for Phase I is operational, with 32 revenue circles of 
the MSEB committed to the DPC to meet its billing. So far, despite the 
controversy surrounding the bills, they have not been encashed even once. 
Curiously enough, there had been, according to well- placed sources, some 
informal, even if feeble suggestions that the DPC may go slow on the 
activation of the second phase of the project, which the State says does not 
come within its ability to digest the burden. If so, why did it want the 
escrow to be operationalised? 
The MSEB had to point out, following this demand, that DPC could not have the 
cake and eat it too. It could not invoke the force majeure clause, then 
threaten to have the PPA terminated and at the same time, ask for activation 
of this feature of the PPA. At the London meeting of the Board, this issue 
was neither listed nor discussed. 
The escrow agreement, as designed, requires fresh infusion of funds through 
allocation of more regions of the MSEB's revenue network to meet shortfalls 
since the tariff is forever mounting or remains high and as the Godbole 
Committee pointed out, a "situation where virtually all of MSEB's revenues 
would be required to be escrowed to meet DPC payments". 
That would leave little "for wages and fuel, let alone additional power 
purchase" from any source and the Godbole panel wanted it cancelled. Was it, 
therefore, a demand for operationalisation of the agreement to see what steps 
the MSEB and the Government would take? 
PPA to be terminated in May? 
Even if DPC decides to issue notice terminating the PPA, it would not be 
earlier than mid-May since IDBI, which leads the consortium of Indian lenders 
guaranteeing the provisions made by the foreign lenders, had asked for a 
three-week freeze on any decision by the company. 
IDBI, which voted against authorising the local management to issue a notice 
terminating the PPA at its London meeting, suggested that by that time the 
re-negotiation could commence, even as members of the consortium led by it 
were consulted given their very high exposures. 
The IDBI-led consortium's cover of around Rs. 6,000- crores to lenders abroad 
makes it a major player in the events that would unfold in the near future. 
Its stand has been in sharp contrast to the overseas financiers, who were 
dismayed at the non-payment of bills by the MSEB in time, the disputes and 
the controversy surrounding the project. They are more inclined towards 
withdrawing from the project. 
Close between 70 and 80 per cent of the debt on the $ 3 billion project has 
come from foreign lenders. The Indian component also leads to serious 
concerns as those of their foreign counterparts. It is unlikely that the DPC 
board can take any decision independent of the wishes or inclinations of the 
lenders. 
In effect, the IDBI told the board, "Give us some time; we will come back." 
Now that the Madhav Godbole Committee has been expanded with the addition of 
the MSEB Chairman, the State Government and also a nominee of the Union 
Finance Ministry, negotiations could commence, but the DPC, which has adopted 
a blow hot, blow cold attitude, would have to respond. 
The Maharashtra Chief Minister, Mr. Vilasrao Deshmukh, has said that the 
moment the Centre nominates its representative, "we will write to the DPC to 
come for renegotiations". The DPC response would indicate the course it wants 
to take - terminate the deal or enter into talks.


Sinha hopes sanctions will be lifted soon

Asia Intelligence Wire 

WASHINGTON, MAY 1. The Finance Minister, Mr. Yashwant Sinha, has expressed 
confidence that the United States will lift the economic sanctions against 
India "as quickly as possible". 
Mr. Sinha, here for the last few days to attend the Spring Meetings of the 
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, had a number of bilateral 
meetings with his counterparts from around the world, including the U.S. 
Treasury Secretary, Mr. Paul O'Neill.
The sanctions figured at the meeting with Mr. O'Neill, but only at the 
latter's instance. "He himself mentioned the issue of sanctions," Mr. Sinha 
told reporters at a press conference at the Indian embassy here. 
"India's views have been very clear. We have said from day one that the 
sanctions hurt U.S. interests more than they hurt Indian interests and the 
fact that they are raising it *with us is an indication of their keen desire 
to be able to do away with it as quickly as possible," he said. 
During a meeting here last month with Mr. Jaswant Singh, the Secretary of 
State, Gen. Colin Powell, raised the issue. 
Mr. Sinha said his meeting with Mr. O'Neill reflected a substantial measure 
of the commitment and interest of the Republican administration and the 
desire to pursue the outlines of the Vision Statement as it related to 
economic and financial matters. Mr. O'Neill accepted the invitation to visit 
India later this year to attend the second of a series of Cabinet-level forum 
meetings, first of which was held in Washington last year. 
Mr. Sinha said the Enron imbroglio did not figure in any of his meetings here 
but the subject of foreign direct investment did. In fact, the Minister had 
brought it with Mr. O'Neill and explained the present situation. Mr. O'Neill 
was said to have been satisfied; and Mr. Sinha said the Enron problem was 
well understood here and the issue was not a dampener to foreign investment 
in India. 
Concern at violence against minorities 
In another development, the U.S. Commission on international religious 
freedom has flayed India - the BJP - for the "disturbing increase" in 
violence against religious minorities and called on the Bush administration 
to take steps to pressure New Delhi into pursuing those responsible for 
violent acts against religious minorities. 
"The violence is especially troubling because it has coincided with the 
increase in political influence at the national and in some places the State 
level of the Sangh Parivar, a collection of exclusivist Hindu nationalist 
groups of which the current ruling party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, is a 
part," the Commission said in the section on India. 
The Commission said its perception came from a number of sources including an 
extensive examination of the situation in India, testimony from Indians of 
various religious hues, experts, academics and through personal interviews of 
victimised groups. Its efforts to travel in an official capacity to India had 
been scuttled by the Government there, the Commission said. 
Apart from the friction between Muslims and Hindus and the contributing 
causes to these over the years, the Commission said, the violence against 
Christians increased "dramatically" in India since 1998. "Particularly 
troubling are the continued reports that religious institutions are being 
pointedly desecrated by militant groups, groups that several Christian 
leaders describe as associated with the Sangh Parivar," it said. Though the 
BJP-led Government was not directly implicated, many accused it of hesitating 
to prosecute persons or groups responsible, in the process building a climate 
where extremists believed violence against religious minorities would go 
unpunished. 
"Though the worst of the extremist groups do not have official power, they 
are closely aligned with those in power and are seen by human rights 
organisation to be deliberately encouraging an environment of increasing 
hostility towards religious minorities," the Commission said. 
It also mentioned the suggestion that the tension between the ruling BJP and 
members of the Sangh Parivar was partly behind the Government's reluctance to 
pursue the perpetrators of sectarian violence. It also made suggestions to 
the Bush administration on how to deal with India, first of them being that 
the administration "should persistently press India to pursue perpetrators of 
violence against religious groups." 
The Bush administration has been called upon to press New Delhi to oppose 
attempts to interfere with or prohibit ties between religious communities in 
India and any government efforts to regulate religious choice or conversion. 
The U.S. should pressure New Delhi to allow official visits from government 
agencies concerned with human rights, including religious freedom; and that 
New Delhi should also be asked to allow visits from non- governmental human 
rights organisations and groups concerned with religious freedom. 
The Commission also called on the U.S. to allocate funds from its foreign 
assistance programmes for the promotion of education on religious tolerance 
and inclusiveness in India.





Neither State nor MSEB has defaulted on agreement with Enron

(c) 2001 PTI Ltd. 

Mumbai, May 1 (PTI) Chief Minister ofthe western Indian state of Maharashtra 
Vilasrao Deshmukh Tuesday said neither the state government nor the state 
electricity board had "defaulted" on contractual agreements with Enron
-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) prompting the latter to slap a 
termination notice on the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB). 

"It will not be proper for the government to announce its public stance over 
the issue unless it gets to know something officially from Enron", Deshmukh 
said when his attention was drawn to the dispute between MSEB and Enron with 
both treatening to serve termination notices on each aother for breaking 
contractual agreements.
The government was of the view that the Enron imbroglio must be resolved 
amicably through negotiations, the Chief Minister told reporters. 

Deshmukh said the energy review committee, headed by former bureaucrat Dr 
Madhav Godbole, had been given powers to renegotiate the Power Purchase 
Agreement (PPA) between DPC and MSEB. The Godbole committee that reviewed the 
enery scenario in general and Enron deal in particular recently submitted its 
report to the state government.

Sanctions hurt US interests more than India: Sinha

05/01/2001
Press Trust of India Limited 
(c) 2001 PTI Ltd. 

Washington, May 1 (PTI) India Tuesday asserted that economic sanctions by the 
US hurt Washington more than New Delhi and said it would be in both 
countries' interest if Bush Administration lifted them "as quickly as 
possible". 

"Our views have been very clear. We have said right from day one that 
sanctions hurt the US interests more than they hurt Indian interests, and the 
fact that they are raising it with us is an indication of their, I think, 
keen desire to be able to do away with it as quickly as possible, Indian 
Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha told reporters here.

After a meeting with his US counterpart, Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, 
Sinha said "it will be in the interest of both countries if the US could see 
its way to lifting sanctions with legislative approval." 

During the talks, he said surprisingly O'Neill himself mentioned the issue of 
sanctions imposed on India after the Pokhran nuclear tests in May 1998. 

Referring to the Enron issue, he said both Enron and the government of 
western Indian state of Maharashtra have agreed not to take precipitative 
action and "I personally feel there is no reason for us to think that because 
there is some problem with Enron it is going to act as a dampener to FDI 
(Foreign Direct Investment) in India." 

The Maharashtra Government has set up a negotiating team with a 
representative from the federal government to renegotiate the power purchase 
agreement with Enron. 

"We also agreed neither should take any precipitate action and that we should 
negotiate and find a negotiated solution to this problem," Sinha said.

Sinha confident US will lift sanctions in its own interest

T V Parasuram 

Washington, May 1 (PTI) Indian Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha has expressed 
confidence that the United States will lift the sanctions imposed on India 
following the May 1998 Pokhran nuclear explosions "as quickly as possible."

Sinha said he told the US Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill during their 
meeting that things were quite normal (despite the sanctions) in certain 
areas and "it will be in the interests of both countries if the US 
Administration could see its way to lifting sanctions with legislative 
approval." 

"Surprisingly he (O'Nell) himself mentioned the issue of sanctions," Sinha 
told reporters Monday. 
"Our (India's) views have been very clear. We have said right from day one 
that sanctions hurt US interests more than they hurt Indian interests, and 
the fact that they are raising it with us is an indication of their, I think, 
keen desire to be able to do away with it as quickly as possible," he said. 

The Indian Finance Minister said that he and O'Neill discussed issues 
concerning the US and India and pointed out that the 'Vision Statement signed 
by then-US President Bill Clinton and Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari 
Vajpayee envisaged a Cabinet level forum to deal with economic and financial 
matters. 

The meeting with O'Neill showed a commitment and involvement of the present 
US Administration to India in a very substantial measure, Sinha said. 

He said that he had also extended an invitation to O'Neill to visit India 
later this year to attend the next meeting of the forum, adding the 
invitation was accepted. 

Sinha said the performance of Indian economy was recognised by the IMF and 
added that everyone was very confident that not only would India be able to 
maintain its growth but improve upon it. 

When asked what accounted for India's decision to welcome a new trade round 
now though it had been opposed by India and other developing countries at 
Seattle, Sinha said: "Our position has been that we are not against a new 
trade round, and we have reiterated that position here. The world community 
also feels that there should be a new trade round. 

"We have our point of view with regard to the agenda for the new trade round. 
I don't think we have diluted that stand or that position. There was a 
general feeling that a new trade round, if properly conducted and properly 
negotiated, could be of great help," he said. 

Pointing out that EU is reported to be spending 400 billion US dollar a year 
for agricultural subsidies, which is many times their total overseas 
development assistance, Sinha said if the agricultural market could be opened 
to exports from developing countries, including India, they would benefit 
greatly. 

"So there is a general feeling that a new trade round should take place but 
on the basis of an understanding about what the agenda and the outcome will 
be. That is something in regard to which developing countries will lay a very 
important role," he said. 

When asked that many people were of the view that the rupee may go down to 50 
to the US dollar, Sinha said he had heard that "doomsday scenario" several 
times before for the last three years and it had not happened. "I don't think 
we have reason to be despondent on that score." 

On NRI investment in India, Sinha said India had a very positive outlook 
about NRI investment and he had already done a great deal to make it 
worthwhile for them to invest in India. 

Answering a query on the Enron issue, he said that no one had raised that 
(the issue) with him during his meetings with several ministers and 
multilaterals here, but the general issue of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) 
came up during his meeting with O'Neill and "I myself took the opportunity to 
point out to him what was happening. 
"I explained to him that I had a meeting with the Chief Minister of 
Maharashtra (a western Indian state) a few days before I came here in which 
the Power Minister of the federal government also joined and we came to the 
conclusion...that the Maharashtra government would set up a negotiating team, 
which they have done now to renegotiate the power purchase agreement with 
Enron. 

"We agreed that we will nominate a Government of India representative on this 
negotiating team. We also agreed that neither of the two sides (Enron and 
Maharashtra) should take any precipitate action and that we should negotiate 
and find a negotiated solution to this problem," Sinha said. 

He said "I personally feel there is no reason for us to think that because 
there is some problem with Enron it is going to act as a dampener to FDI in 
India." 

Asked when would FDI in India reach the level in China, he said that the 
first thing that needed to be done was to implement the budget as soon as 
possible.

Sinha urges U.S., EU, Japan to boost growth

Indian Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha said he is urging his U.S. Japan and 
EU counterparts to boost economic growth, as the global slowdown is having a 
detrimental impact on India and the developing world. 

Sinha said he told IMF's policy making committee, the International Monetary 
and Financial Committee, that the onus for reviving global growth is on the 
three leading economies.

"I said there was a need for much greater proactive policies for improving 
growth rates, especially in the G3 economies (U.S., Japan, EU)," Sinha told 
reporters after the close of the IMF's Spring meetings, adding that "a 
slowdown in the world economy will have an impact on our exports because 
these are the markets which are our major markets for exports." 

But he said that the slowdown has not had as negative of an effect on India 
as it has had on other developing nations in Asia because the Indian economy 
is largely dependent on domestic demand. 

"[While] the slowdown in the world economy will also have some impact on 
India, it may not be as large as other East Asian countries." 

Sinha said his government will work to create an environment "where fresh 
investment becomes attractive," which he said would take place when the 
parliament passes his reform-oriented budget for 2001/02. It passed the lower 
house on Wednesday. 

"We'll have to encourage demand and to various measures which have been 
continuing from the past and which I have enumerated in this year's budget," 
he said, adding that "when demand picks up investment climate improves. 
Domestic investment will also take place and so will foreign investment." 

He said the dispute between Enron Corp and the government of Maharashtra 
state is not expected to cause foreign investors to think twice about 
investing in India. 

"I don't think because there is a problem with Enron it is necessarily going 
to act as a dampener to [foreign direct investment]," he said. 

Sinha said he raised the issue in an April 27 bilateral meeting with Treasury 
Secretary Paul O'Neill, who "appeared satisfied" with Sinha's suggestion that 
Enron and the Maharashtra government should hold negotiations to ensure the 
continuation of the 2 bln usd project, which Enron is on the verge scrapping.
 
Sinha added that O'Neill accepted his invitation to visit New Delhi at an 
unspecified date later this year as part of bilateral cabinet level forum 
initiated under President Bill Clinton in 2000. 

And he said that O'Neill raised the issue of U.S. sanctions against India 
which have been in place since India conducted nuclear tests in May 1998. 
Sinha said that he did not raise the issue with O'Neill because "our views 
have been clear. Sanctions hurt U.S. interests more than they hurt India's 
interests." 

He said that O'Neill's raising of the issue demonstrated a willingness on the 
part of the Bush administration to move toward lifting the sanctions.

U. Houston: U. Houston forum focuses on minority education

HOUSTON -- Increasing access to higher education for members of Houston's 
minority communities will be one of the most critical challenges facing the 
city's business and civic leaders, said a panel of such leaders at a forum 
held Monday on the University of Houston campus.

"Who Will Lead?" was the topic of the discussion for the 2001 Elizabeth D. 
Rockwell Distinguished Leadership Forum, which was co-sponsored by the Bauer 
College of Business. 

Rockwell is a winner of the UH Distinguished Alumna Award and is an executive 
of CIBC Oppenheimer Corp. 
Demographic trends indicate that Texas -- and Houston -- will within a few 
years be comprised of a minority-majority population, meaning that the 
different minority groups combined will outnumber Caucasians. 

The speakers agreed that ensuring young people from those backgrounds gain 
the education necessary to enter the increasingly high-tech workforce is a 
matter of economic survival for the region. 

"There's nothing more important in our community right now," said Kenneth 
Lay, chairman of the board of Enron, the Houston-based natural gas supply 
company that Fortune magazine has named the World's Most Innovative Company 
for the last six years. 

"Some progress is being made. Some programs have been shown to be pretty 
effective," Lay said. "They have significantly increased the graduation rates 
(of minority members) from high school, the percentage going on to college, 
and the percentage getting out of college." 

Lay noted that less than 10 percent of Hispanics in Texas graduate from 
college. 

"That is a time bomb waiting to blow us all up, unless we solve that 
problem," he said, adding that a large number of Hispanics, particularly 
male, who drop out of high school eventually go to prison. 

"We spend about $30,000 a year keeping them in prison, but yet we can't spend 
maybe $2,000 or $3,000 a year trying to get them educated while they're in 
high school," he said. 

John Mendelsohn, president of the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer 
Center, concurred. 

"I think it's very important that a city of this size have major university 
power to take the kids that do make it into college, and educate them and 
move them into the leadership roles, and join our workforce as leaders," 
Mendelsohn said. 

"I applaud (UH President) Art Smith's attempts to bring the University of 
Houston to a higher level," he added, in reference to the Smith 
administration's advocating of the Texas Legislature to create a Texas 
Excellence Fund. The fund would help the University achieve the status of a 
Tier I research university. 

"I think it's critically important for the fourth largest city in the United 
States to have a school like this join the jewel we have of Rice University, 
which is small and one of the very best in the world, but can't produce the 
number of well-educated youngsters that this public university can," 
Mendelsohn said. 

Joseph Pratt, a faculty member of the Bauer College of Business and executive 
director of the UH Scholars' Community, pointed out from the audience that 
the University has several such programs to encourage young people from 
minority communities to pursue higher education. The Scholars' Community is 
an on-campus program designed partially to increase retention of college 
students from underprivileged backgrounds. 
The other members of the panel were Ben Love, retired chairman and chief 
executive officer of Chase Bank of Texas, and Robert Smith III, senior vice 
president in charge of the Houston branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Dallas.
 

Prebon Yamane Hires Former RCN Executive to Run Bandwidth Unit

Prebon Yamane Hires Former RCN Executive to Run Bandwidth Unit

     Jersey City, New Jersey, May 1 (Bloomberg) -- Prebon Yamane
(USA) Inc., a derivatives brokerage, has hired a former RCN Corp.
executive to run a new unit that will buy and sell space on fiber-
optic networks used for phone and Internet services.
     Rajan Chopra, 49, a former president of new product
development for Princeton, New Jersey-based telecommunications
provider RCN, will be president of Prebon Bandwidth, which will
provide access to high-speed communications systems.
     Trading companies such as Enron Corp. see broadband bandwidth
as one of the most promising emerging commodity markets as
businesses look for the cheapest ways to zip data, voices and
images around the world.
     ``The potential of this market is huge,'' Chopra said in an
interview, though he declined to say how big. Chopra was involved
in derivatives trading and risk management at Chase Manhattan Bank
before joining RCN in 1998.
     Potential customers will be wholesale users of data networks,
such as International Business Machines Corp. or Citigroup Inc.,
and telecommunications companies looking to add bandwidth to their
networks or lease excess carrying capacity, Chopra said.
     ``We try to understand their businesses, their risk
management and trading needs,'' Chopra said. ``And we provide
market intelligence and timely execution'' of transactions.
     Trading opportunities in bandwidth will increase as users
shift from trans-continental routes to regional networks, similar
to the electricity markets, Chopra said.
     ``The bandwidth market has many of the same attributes as the
swaps market in its infancy, and holds the same exciting
promise,'' said Sanjay Sathe, executive vice president for Prebon
Bandwith, who was also previously involved in Chase Manhattan
Bank's derivatives business.
     Prebon Yamane (USA) and Prebon Bandwith are divisions of
Prebon Yamane Ltd., a London-based broker with operations in
financial derivatives, foreign exchange, energy and metals.

Enron's Lay Discusses India's Dabhol Power Project: Comment
2001-05-01 19:31 (New York)

     Houston, May 1 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. Chairman Ken Lay
discusses the company's Dabhol Power Co. project with investors at
the company's annual shareholder meeting in Houston and answered
questions about operations in a press conference later.
     India's Maharashtra State Electricity Board, which buys power
from the plant, has refused to pay Enron bills of 3 billion rupees
($64 million). Enron has invoked credit guarantees by India's
federal government to cover the nonpayment. Lay said Tuesday that
Maharashtra State board, a quasi-governmental agency, is $48
million in arrears.

On a possible sale:
     ``We're not in any discussions right now about selling the
plant.''

On the Maharashtra State Electricity Board:
     ``They want the power, they just don't want to pay for it.''

On the strength of Enron's contracts:
     ``We have good, strong contracts that have been tested in the
courts 29 to 30 times. I think we will work this problem through
in a way that won't impair our investment. It's not going to be
pretty, and there's going to be a lot of noise.''

On the impact of the turmoil on the project:
     ``It is impacting operations, but it's not too late to
curtail any damage,'' Lay said, specifying construction work.
``We're not pulling anybody out of there right now.''
