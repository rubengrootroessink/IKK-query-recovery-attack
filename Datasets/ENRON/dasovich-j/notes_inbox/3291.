Thanks Jeff.  No problem getting off the call as I think you had the time to 
more than adequately describe the situation in California.  We are going to 
allow OPIC to continue on the path towards loan approval for our project and 
see whether any problems flare up from Congressman Sherman.  We're keeping an 
eye on whether any other folks in the political realm here in Washington try 
to utilize some of Sherman's rhetoric in other instances.  From what I've 
heard from you and the GE guys, I'd say there is ample, factual information 
to refute such misguided claims.  Thanks again for your help.  Best regards, 
Scott

Sorry I had to get off the call early.  Hope it helped.  If there's anything 
else you need, just let me know.

Best,
Jeff
