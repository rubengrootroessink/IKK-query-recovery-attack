Tomorow night at Atlas Cafe the Dark Hollow Band is playing, featuring Larry
Cohea on banjo, that guy who tried to kiss Prentice on guitar (John
Kornhauser), and that thick-glasses, stick-thin, white-trash lookin' woman
on bass (y'all know the one, 'specially you Cameron). I figure we should go
on down there as a preliminary rage for Jeff's Fowtee-ieth. What you say?
Goes from 8-10, so they say.
