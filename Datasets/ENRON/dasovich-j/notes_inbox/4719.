Jeff:

Attached is some information regarding EPMI sales to CA utilities and munis.  
We looked at only transactions by the Middle Market Group.  It might be 
possible to bring in trades made through the traders, but that would require 
a significant time investment and I don't think there would be that many 
additional deals.

It is interesting to note that our average price for the very long term deals 
is $50.  For CA utilities and munis that were bold enough to make decisions, 
their prices are below $50!

Call to discuss.

Chris
