A rush to duck power outages: About half of the state's electric users=20
already have been exempted from rolling blackouts.
By Carrie Peyton, Terri Hardy and Clint Swett
Bee Staff Writers
(Published May 31, 2001)=20
Up and down California, businesses, government agencies, campuses and other=
s=20
are scrambling to join the millions who will escape this summer's predicted=
=20
waves of rolling blackouts.=20
Some have gotten state regulators to change blackout rules. Some have given=
=20
different versions of their needs to utilities, changing their stories in=
=20
ways that satisfy exemption standards. Some have persuaded legislators to=
=20
propose laws just for them.=20
"People that have political power or economic power are going to find ways =
of=20
getting exempted. It happens all the time," said Richard Bilas, one of five=
=20
appointed members of the state Public Utilities Commission.=20
Every addition to the largely confidential list of those exempt from outage=
s=20
boosts the frequency of blackouts for everyone else.=20
While a few thousand institutions -- including hospitals, fire departments=
=20
and prisons -- are deemed "essential" users who should not be blacked out,=
=20
nearly half the state is spared outages because millions more share circuit=
s=20
with those exempt facilities.=20
In Sacramento, for example, the electric utility will not cut power to a=20
water treatment facility along the American River for fear of endangering=
=20
water quality. But sheltering that circuit also spares the sprawling=20
California State University, Sacramento, campus nearby.=20
If exemptions grow, "at some point, you lose the ability to reliably have=
=20
rolling blackouts," said PUC commissioner Carl Wood. He has estimated that=
=20
fewer than 1,000 more institutions can be exempted without compromising the=
=20
system that rolls outages from one part of the state to the next when the=
=20
electric grid can't supply power for everyone.=20
With close to half of the state sitting out outages, "that means the other=
=20
half is going to get blacked out twice as often. It's basically unfair to t=
he=20
rest of the community," said Paul Perkovic, who sits on the board of the=20
Montara Sanitary District, which provides sewer, garbage and other services=
=20
to a San Mateo County community.=20
Perkovic urged the PUC last week to make more government agencies, includin=
g=20
his tiny district, eligible for blackouts, arguing that they should be=20
prepared for other emergencies anyway.=20
The deluge of exemption requests has created a dilemma of values and number=
s.=20
Should nursing homes be placed on the essential list? What about outpatient=
=20
surgical clinics or transit agencies or schools? And when, if ever, should=
=20
someone review existing exemptions to see if they're still needed?=20
Utilities and regulators say they try to apply the rules fairly. But=20
inconsistencies appear, and the rules keep changing as the realization sink=
s=20
in that many more blackouts could await California.=20
The state's two biggest utilities are close in size, but one shields about =
25=20
percent more customers than the other from outages.=20
The Sacramento Municipal Utility District, which sets its own outage=20
standards, exempts only 21 of its 530,000 customers.=20
Pacific Gas and Electric Co., which applies rules set by the PUC, is much=
=20
more generous, giving 2,600 of its 4.8 million customers the "get out of=20
blackouts free card."=20
Southern California Edison is even more open handed in its interpretation o=
f=20
the same rules, doling out 3,600 exemptions among its 4.3 million customers=
.=20
The roads to getting an exemption are varied. There are at least three plac=
es=20
to start for those who want to stay cool and bright when all around are goi=
ng=20
dark.=20
Businesses or governments can apply to their utility, which determines=20
whether they fit rules for a public safety exemption.=20
Or if their utility is regulated by the PUC, they can apply directly to a n=
ew=20
program set up to examine their petition for exemptions.=20
Finally, they can go to the state Legislature, where lawmakers have=20
introduced a range of bills that would protect schools, nursing homes,=20
refineries -- even Universal Studios.=20
But in the attempt to quickly piece together a system to grant exemptions,=
=20
critics say, a haphazard process has been developed.=20
Dan Johnson, associate vice president for facilities development and=20
operations at San Jose State University, said he has sought an exemption fr=
om=20
PG&E and is still waiting, while campuses with similar circumstances have=
=20
succeeded. Now he wonders about the fairness of what seems to him a murky=
=20
decision-making process.=20
"Each utility has its own way of dealing with exemptions," he said. "If it=
=20
appears that the decision is arbitrary and capricious, we hope that when we=
=20
appeal to the PUC some sanity prevails."=20
One person in PG&E's tariff's department has done nothing but process=20
exemption requests since March, officials said, after the job became too bi=
g=20
to be absorbed in another worker's duties.=20
About 200 requests have come in since early this year, and PG&E has approve=
d=20
45 of them and denied 72, with 79 still pending.=20
The process is aimed at being a straightforward evaluation of whether an=20
entity fits into existing PUC categories of "essential" customers.=20
But it isn't always that simple, said Roland Risser, PG&E director of tarif=
fs=20
and compliance.=20
Sometimes, said Risser, a customer will say it has adequate backup=20
generation, and PG&E will let the customer know the backup disqualifies it=
=20
from an exemption. Later, the customer calls back and says "we've=20
re-evaluated" and the backup generator won't supply all its needs.=20
"We just take their word for it," Risser said. "We don't police."=20
From universities to transit agencies, a wide range of customers worry that=
=20
as different utilities apply PUC standards, those regulations don't always=
=20
yield the same results.=20
So far, at least eight campuses within the University of California and CSU=
=20
systems will not be subject to rolling blackouts, including UC Davis.=20
In a letter to PG&E asking for an exemption, UC Davis stressed the potentia=
l=20
danger to animals in its veterinary hospital and the possible destruction o=
f=20
research. But PG&E spokesman Ron Low said health and safety arguments are t=
he=20
only ones that matter. PG&E granted the exemption because the campus does n=
ot=20
have generators for its airport and its radio station -- which is part of t=
he=20
emergency broadcasting network.=20
Transportation officials say they're frustrated by the mixed signals sent b=
y=20
utilities.=20
While the PUC has declared the Bay Area Rapid Transit District exempt from=
=20
blackouts, Edison says Los Angeles' Municipal Transportation Authority is=
=20
not. Ralph de la Cruz, deputy executive director of operations for the MTA,=
=20
doesn't understand that logic. True, BART travels under the bay. But the=20
MTA's Green Line runs down the middle of the I-105 Century Freeway. Some MT=
A=20
rail lines are elevated, and passengers trying to extricate themselves from=
 a=20
stalled train could plunge to the ground.=20
The MTA asked Edison to reconsider and has appealed to the PUC.=20
"We are anxious to see this resolved as quickly as possible, before blackou=
ts=20
occur," de la Cruz said. "My God, we don't want to be in the position of ou=
r=20
lines experiencing the prospect of stranded passengers."=20
The San Francisco Giants also have appealed to the PUC to be exempt during=
=20
games. A blackout at Pacific Bell Park would "pose major operational=20
challenges," said Staci Slaughter, a Giants' spokeswoman.=20
Electric turnstiles wouldn't work. Concession stands could only accept cash=
=20
only for hot dogs and beers. The field would go dark and night games would=
=20
have to be canceled.=20
The PUC has been so swamped with bids to escape blackouts that it has hired=
 a=20
scientific and engineering consulting firm to study who else should be adde=
d.=20
Meanwhile, it has asked utilities to look into ways to reconfigure the wiri=
ng=20
so that each essential customer won't take so many nonessential ones out of=
=20
the blackout pool. A report on those efforts is due Friday.=20
"We've been deluged at the commission by individual requests that do have a=
=20
broader public policy good," said PUC president Loretta Lynch, including on=
e=20
from the lone U.S. maker of a blood-clotting agent for hemophiliacs.=20
The PUC has hired Exponent, a Menlo Park consulting firm, for $615,000 to=
=20
analyze who else should be exempt.=20
Exemption applications are due Friday and will be reviewed by people with=
=20
specialties ranging from toxicology to environmental sciences to electrical=
=20
engineering, said Robert Caligiuri, an Exponent vice president.=20
The company will rank applicants based on safety risks, and it will work wi=
th=20
utilities to determine the potential impacts of adding each one to the=20
exemption pool. It will report to the commission in July, and Wood expects =
a=20
decision in early August. He hopes the new rules can be implemented by=20
utilities soon after.=20
But no one within the PUC is taking an equally rigorous look at those who a=
re=20
already exempt, and the commission is split on whether such a study is=20
necessary. Wood, who specializes in the blackout issue, believes that the=
=20
commission simply doesn't have the time for such an effort during the curre=
nt=20
emergency.=20
Unsure of their prospects with utilities or the PUC, some are taking their=
=20
cases to the Capitol.=20
State Sen. Sheila Kuehl, D-Santa Monica, said lawmakers are scrambling to=
=20
draft energy policies that help all Californians, and at the same time, loo=
k=20
after interests in their districts.=20
One example is Kuehl's bill that would allow 15 businesses -- including=20
Universal Studios -- which straddle the boundary between Edison and the Los=
=20
Angeles Department of Water and Power to get their electricity from DWP. No=
t=20
only would that deal provide them with cheaper rates, but it would likely=
=20
exempt them from blackouts.=20
The Los Angeles city utility is not part of the region controlled by the=20
state Independent System Operator, and so it functions independently when t=
he=20
ISO orders utilities to impose blackouts.=20
Kuehl said the proposal is fair because those businesses were harmed by a=
=20
"geographic quirk," where parts of the park are in DWP territory but they a=
re=20
solely an Edison customer.=20
"These are already DWP customers," Kuehl said. "They should be able to draw=
=20
all their energy from DWP."=20
Other lawmakers are carrying bills for public schools, oil refineries and=
=20
customers in areas where there are extreme temperatures. Sen. Richard=20
Polanco, D-Los Angeles, is proposing a law that would ensure municipal=20
utilities -- such as his district's DWP -- don't have to participate in=20
blackouts.=20
Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey, chairwoman of the Senate energy=20
committee, said the state has to realize that not everyone can be exempt.=
=20
"All these bills that seek to put one group of folks in a better position=
=20
than someone else do is Balkanize the issue," Bowen said. "Unfortunately,=
=20
instead of having people come together to try and share the pain equally,=
=20
we're seeing folks rushing for their own lifeboat without regard for who ge=
ts=20
thrown overboard in the process."=20

Sempra chief: County may fare OK on outages=20



By Kristen Green=20
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER=20
May 31, 2001=20
San Diego County may be more insulated from blackouts this summer than the=
=20
rest of the state, the chief executive officer of Sempra Energy said=20
yesterday.=20
Stephen Baum said power supply shortages aren't as profound in Southern=20
California, in part, because the capabilities for importing energy are=20
better.=20
And that might mean Northern Californians will face more days in the dark=
=20
than San Diegans over the next three months, he said.=20

In a lecture at University of California San Diego yesterday, Baum, who=20
oversees San Diego Gas & Electric's parent company, said the state will=20
probably have at least 30 days of rolling blackouts this summer, an estimat=
e=20
often repeated by other energy experts.=20
But Baum hopes to limit San Diego County energy outages by introducing a=20
rolling blackout reduction program. Sempra is asking the state to support t=
he=20
program, which would give San Diego County credit for the energy that=20
businesses contribute to statewide energy supplies when electricity reserve=
s=20
drop dangerously low.=20
Local companies would turn on generators as the state nears blackouts, whic=
h=20
would make more energy available. In return, Sempra asks that the state=20
reduce the number of households that would be blacked out in San Diego=20
County. The state Public Utilities Commission has not considered the idea=
=20
yet.=20
State officials, however, have suggested that the program be applied=20
statewide. That would mean San Diego County businesses that run generators=
=20
would contribute to the state's energy supply, but the number of local=20
residents impacted by blackouts would not shrink.=20
During the afternoon lecture, attended by about 30 UCSD students and=20
visitors, Baum acknowledged the significance of President Bush's visit=20
Tuesday but said he disagrees with Bush's opposition to price caps.=20
And he expressed frustration that a resolution seems so far off.=20
"I see no leadership in this issue," he said.=20

'Plan B' gains key support in Assembly=20



Lawmakers also want state costs on energy to be fully disclosed

CALIFORNIA'S POWER CRISIS=20

SACRAMENTO -- Assembly Democratic leaders have decided to back an alternati=
ve=20
to Gov. Gray Davis' plan to keep Southern California Edison out of bankrupt=
cy=20
that places less emphasis on state purchase of the Edison transmission=20
system.=20
The long-awaited "Plan B" from Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Van Nuy=
s,=20
is taking shape as legislative leaders are demanding that the governor reve=
al=20
detailed information about state power purchases, which total more than $7=
=20
billion.=20
"You can't come to a solution of this problem until you know exactly what t=
he=20
Department of Water Resources is spending," said Senate President Pro Tempo=
re=20
John Burton, D-San Francisco.=20
A Davis spokesman said the administration expects to begin complying with t=
he=20
legislators' request soon. But there is a question about whether standard=
=20
confidentiality clauses prevent release of long-term contracts and concern=
=20
that revealing daily purchases would result in higher prices.=20
"The governor philosophically wants to release them as soon as possible,"=
=20
said Steve Maviglio, Davis' press secretary. "We just want to make sure we=
=20
don't adversely affect our ability to get power at lower cost for the=20
summer."=20
Reserve power levels dropped yesterday, and the state power grid operator=
=20
declared a Stage 2 alert for the first time in three weeks. The Independent=
=20
System Operator said some power plants were off-line for maintenance and ho=
t=20
weather across the state increased demand. Fewer imports were available=20
yesterday in comparison to last week.=20
Another reason legislative leaders are pushing for a full disclosure of sta=
te=20
spending on power is to help the Legislature prepare a new state budget for=
=20
the fiscal year that begins July 1.=20
"There are many reasons that having very precise numbers in that regard are=
=20
important to Sen. Burton and the speaker," said Assemblyman Fred Keeley,=20
D-Boulder Creek, who has been active on the power issue in the Legislature.=
=20
Keeley said disclosure of power spending costs might encourage Republican=
=20
legislators to provide an urgency vote allowing the prompt sale of a bond o=
f=20
up to $13.4 billion to repay the state general fund for the power purchases=
.=20
Without an urgency vote the state cannot begin issuing the massive bond=20
before late August, nearly two months into the new fiscal year. The bond=20
would be paid off by ratepayers over 15 years.=20
In addition, said Keeley, detailed information about state spending might=
=20
also lead to an agreement on legislation sought by Republicans that would=
=20
allow "direct access" purchase of electricity, where businesses and other=
=20
consumers contract with generators and marketers.=20
The state began buying power for utility customers in January after a faile=
d=20
deregulation plan, which froze customer rates as power costs soared, result=
ed=20
in a combined $13 billion debt for Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric and=
=20
left them unable to borrow.=20
After PG&E went into bankruptcy in early April, Davis quickly completed a=
=20
memorandum of understanding to purchase the Edison transmission system for=
=20
$2.76 billion as part of a plan to keep Edison out of bankruptcy and able t=
o=20
resume buying power for its customers by the end of next year.=20
But Republican legislators immediately opposed the state purchase of the=20
transmission system. Democratic legislators think the plan is too generous=
=20
for Edison and are reluctant to approve what consumer groups have called a=
=20
"bailout" of the utility.=20
Burton said that before legislators can evaluate an alternative to the=20
governor's plan they need to know how much the state power purchasing agenc=
y,=20
the Department of Water Resources, is spending and how much money has been=
=20
committed for the future.=20
"Until we can find that out it's kind of tough to plan," Burton said.=20
Speaker Hertzberg has asked Keeley and senior Assembly staff members to=20
prepare the documents for an alternative to the governor's plan that=20
Hertzberg is expected to propose in a few days.=20
"The transmission purchase is not featured as prominently as it was in the=
=20
governor's proposal," Keeley said.=20
One of the options considered by the Assembly Democratic "Plan B" group was=
 a=20
proposal by Assemblymen John Dutra of Fremont and Joe Nation of San Rafael=
=20
that would give the state the option of purchasing the Edison transmission=
=20
system for $1.2 billion within five years.=20
A key part of both the governor's plan and the Dutra-Nation proposal is=20
giving Edison part of the revenue from monthly utility bills, a "dedicated=
=20
rate component," that could be used to pay off Edison's debt and allow the=
=20
utility to resume buying power.=20
Both plans also would require Edison to make other concessions, including=
=20
providing low-cost power and the return of a $400 million tax refund that=
=20
Edison gave to its parent firm. Generators would be asked to forgive 30=20
percent of what they are owed.=20
Assembly Republicans said last week that what the state should receive in=
=20
exchange for aiding Edison is not the transmission system, but an agreement=
=20
that Edison would build new power plants to provide low-cost power.






FERC boss unfazed by Davis' lawsuit threat=20



Court has dismissed similar action already
By Toby Eckert=20
COPLEY NEWS SERVICE=20
May 31, 2001=20
WASHINGTON -- The head of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said=20
yesterday he is confident the agency would prevail in a legal battle with=
=20
California Gov. Gray Davis over electricity price controls.=20
"I feel good about our chances," said FERC Chairman Curtis Hebert, citing a=
=20
federal court's decision Tuesday to dismiss a similar lawsuit filed by=20
California legislative leaders.=20
Davis has threatened to sue the FERC for allegedly failing to meet its lega=
l=20
obligation to ensure that wholesale power costs are "just and reasonable."=
=20
Such a move would be the latest escalation in Davis' running battle with th=
e=20
agency over its response to California's power crisis.=20
"I think the 9th Circuit (federal appeals court) made very clear that the=
=20
commission is doing its job appropriately," Hebert told reporters.=20
A three-judge panel of the San Francisco-based court rejected a suit by=20
California Senate President Pro Tempore John Burton and Assembly Speaker=20
Robert Hertzberg that sought to force the FERC to impose wholesale price=20
controls. The court said the lawmakers "have not demonstrated that this cas=
e=20
warrants the intervention of this court."=20
Davis says his administration has laid a firmer legal foundation for a=20
lawsuit by first pursuing administrative remedies at the FERC. Several stat=

But as California's energy crisis deepened, Gonzales' position became=20

The committee rejected a bill last week authorizing the creation of a new=

municipal utility district. The new version of the bill simply expresses th=

"intent" that the county, cities and special districts cooperate to obtain =
a=20
stable source of low-priced power.=20
The author, Assemblyman Mark Wyland, R-Escondido, pledged to bring the bill=

Wyland said he hopes to negotiate a bill that would allow the new agency to=

at=20
the proposed new agency would not have the power of eminent domain.=20
Wyland said he thought the original version of the bill was rejected by the=

initially wanted to create a new district without a vote of the people,=20
hoping to quickly get cheaper power.=20
Now legislators have made it clear that a vote of the people will be=20

the proposed new agency might be able to raise taxes.=20

that SDG&E might find beneficial.=20
"It's on that premise that I am here today," Madaffer said, "and I believe=

that would require the SDG&E "balancing account" debt to be paid off by=20

Summing up his approach to unpredictable electricity prices and supplies, t=

"My administration will continue to work to help California through the=20

The president outlined his opposition to electricity price controls -- a=20
stance Democrats have exploited to portray the Bush administration as a=20
lackey for profiteering energy companies.=20
"We will not take any action that makes California's problems worse. And=20
that's why I oppose price caps," he said. "At first blush, for those=20

An long-distance war of words between Democrat Davis and Republican=20
administration officials, particularly Vice President Dick Cheney, has=20
escalated in recent weeks over energy policy.=20
With Davis two seats away on the World Affairs Council dais, Bush pointedly=

called for an end to the acrimony.=20
"For too long, too often, too many have wasted energy pointing fingers and=

Leading up to yesterday's meeting was a week of posturing by spokesmen for=

the two leaders on seemingly every detail, including who invited whom to th=

But when the two met -- Bush and Davis are casual acquaintances from their=

as devoid of rancor as it apparently was of productivity.=20
"The meeting was cordial, informational, businesslike," Davis said.=20
As Davis told it, he even deployed the only remaining weapon in his=20
gubernatorial arsenal -- the threat of a lawsuit -- delicately.=20
"I said, 'Mr. President, you understand I have to do everything in my power=
=20
to seek relief for the people of this state. You would do the same thing if=

you were in my position,' and he agreed," Davis said.=20
Karl Rove, Bush's hard-nosed chief political adviser, also characterized th=
e=20
meeting in amiable terms.=20
"They did agree on one thing: that California is entitled to price relief,"=

The Home Energy Drain=20
How Appliances Draw Electricity, Even When Off=20

By DAVE WILSON, Times Staff Writer=20

?????When devices such as stereos are turned off, we think of them as dead.=
=20
But it turns out they're only mostly dead. And mostly dead is a little bit=
=20
alive.



Graphic: Standby power consumption of common appliances.=20

?????For instance, have you ever wondered how a television set can understa=
nd=20
the "power on" command from the remote control if the TV isn't using any=20
power at all? The fact is nearly all television sets--in fact, most home=20
appliances--use power as long as they're plugged in to a live electrical=20
outlet, if only to receive and interpret remote control signals or keep the=
=20
little clock running.
?????All those little trickles of electricity can add up to a steady stream=
=20
of juice that users end up paying for--power that's being drained from a=20
system that can't meet the state's needs as California enters a summer of=
=20
rolling blackouts and rising power bills. Plus, the delicate electronic=20
circuitry that makes our favorite gizmos work can be damaged when the power=

flow abruptly stops and starts.
?????Researchers refer to this sort-of-off-but-sort-of-on condition as=20
"standby power" and say the drain on the electrical supply is=20
significant--and continuing to rise.
?????"When you add up all these things like TVs and VCRs, it looks like=20

Shopping for a Surge Supressor
Fluctuating power levels can cause damage under certain conditions to devic=
es=20
that draw power all the time. One tactic to prevent damage is using a surge=
=20
supressor.
=01=07 When shopping for a surge suppressor, the key number is the maximum =
level=20
of electricity that will be let through in case of a surge. This number is=
=20
referred to as, depending on the marketing guys behind the product, "clampi=
ng=20
voltage," "let-through voltage" or "voltage rating." The lower the number,=
=20
the better.
=01=07 Right now, the best rating you can get is a surge suppressor carryin=
g the=20

=20
cheaper suppressors take longer to respond to a spike, which can be too lat=

to protect your components.

-- DAVE WILSON


?????The cost of this drain probably isn't especially onerous to most=20
consumers. Leaving your answering machine plugged in all the time, for=20
instance, will cost you about 37 cents a month, assuming you're paying abou=
t=20
17 cents a kilowatt-hour.
?????The total cost of standby power probably is in the neighborhood of $10=
0=20
a year per household at current rates, though that figure will rise as=20
electricity becomes more expensive. Though that's not a vast sum to many=20
people, reducing electricity usage is critical to maintaining a steady powe=
r=20
supply in California.
?????The difference between a Stage 2 power emergency and Stage 3--the poin=
t=20
at which rolling blackouts kick in--is only 3.5% of total reserve electrica=
l=20
capacity. So cutting back on that leaking 10% in homes can make the=20
difference.
?????Not all the standby power is wasted. An answering machine is pretty=20
useless if it doesn't have access to power all the time since part of the=
=20
device's job is to be primed to pick up the phone if it should ring. It's=
=20
those other devices, such as the microwave oven clock that pulls power even=
=20
though nothing's being cooked, that are the problem. All devices that use=
=20
standby power could be designed to use as little electricity as possible.
?????Standby power drain is getting worse as more of the items we have in o=
ur=20
homes move from mechanical switches and timers to electronic controls. The=
=20
typical household today uses 7,000 kilowatt-hours of power each year.
?????Overall, residential consumption of power has risen 17.6%, from 68,000=
=20
gigawatt-hours in 1990 to an estimated 80,000 gigawatt-hours, according to=
=20
the California Energy Commission. Even when adjusted for population growth,=
=20
Californians use more power than they did 10 years ago--despite the fact th=
at=20
household appliances got more energy efficient.
?????One reason: We've got a lot more energy-gobbling devices in our homes.=
=20
For instance, Fred Johnson, who works in Silicon Valley's high-tech industr=
y,=20
has three TVs, each with a DVD player. He's also got two TiVo digital=20
recorder boxes, four computers and two stereo systems.
?????"Fortunately, it's not all on simultaneously," he said.
?????Another reason for the increase in power draw is a simultaneous increa=
se=20
in the number of devices that are always on. For instance, older microwave=
=20
ovens used a mechanical timer, which means the device didn't draw power=20
unless the oven was actually heating something up. Newer ovens use electron=
ic=20
touch pads and digital clocks, both of which require a steady stream of=20
power. Part of the reason for the shift was interest in reliability;=20
mechanical switches wear out or need maintenance, whereas electronic contro=
ls=20
are generally service free.
?????Those digital controls are showing up in things such as stoves,=20
dishwashers, washers and dryers, which means these devices also leak=20
electricity even when they're not actually working.
?????Some devices are so badly designed that they generally use as much=20
electricity when they're theoretically off as when they're on, Meier said.=
=20
"The set-top boxes for cable and satellite television broadcasts are good=
=20
examples," he said. Manufacturers aren't under any pressure to improve the=
=20
design of electronic components in the home because there's no financial=20
incentive for them to do so.
?????Consumers wind up paying the price.
?????"We think there are typically 20 devices in a home that are consuming=
=20
standby power," Meier said. "In the average home in California, standby pow=
er=20
is somewhere around 500 kilowatt-hours a year. And some users are paying 20=
=20
cents a kilowatt. So that's about $100 a year for appliances that aren't=20
actually doing what you bought them for."=20
?????That hundred bucks during the course of a year might seem a pretty sma=
ll=20
price to pay for the ability to change the music coming out of the CD playe=
r=20
without having to lever yourself off the couch.
?????But even if it does bother you, there's not a lot you can do, short of=
=20
unplugging devices when they're not in use. Sometimes unplugging a device=
=20
isn't practical, though, because many components will lose information stor=
ed=20
in them if the power goes out. Your radio might forget its presets, your VC=
R=20
will lose the time and some TVs will have to be reprogrammed with the local=
=20
television stations available. ?????On a fundamental level, this is an issu=
e=20
that has to be addressed by electronics manufacturers, who, until now,=20
largely ignored the issue. Meier has been leading a fight during the last=
=20
couple of years to get manufacturers to build devices that use standby powe=
r=20
more efficiently, to keep that functionality but make better use of=20
electricity.
?????"Some of these devices draw 15 or 20 watts," Meier said. New designs c=
an=20
reduce that flow to 1 watt, but few manufacturers have shown enthusiasm for=
=20
the goal. That might change as governments put pressure on manufacturers.=
=20
Australia, for one, recently endorsed the goal of 1-watt standby drain for=
=20
all appliances.=20
?????In addition, there is some concern that, under certain conditions,=20
devices that draw power all the time could be slightly more vulnerable to=
=20
damage caused by fluctuations in the power supply than devices that are=20
completely powered down.
?????If that's true, it makes such things as surge suppressors and=20
uninterruptible power supplies even more important to consumers at a time=
=20
when rolling blackouts are expected to become a regular occurrence.
?????Surge suppressors are designed to choke off a spike of electricity=20
before it can reach your valuable components and damage them. Typically, a=
=20
lightning strike a mile or so away can flow down electric, telephone or cab=
le=20
television wires and fry any component connected to the line, such as a hom=
e=20
computer. The surge suppressor intercepts that overload.
?????These surges can occur in many different situations, such as apartment=
=20
buildings where large motors--for instance, those used in air conditioners=
=20
and elevators--routinely go on and off.
?????"Any time the power goes off and goes back on again, that's a tremendo=
us=20
hit on the electrical system, and that can cause surges," said John=20
Drengenberg, an electrical engineer who's manager of global consumer affair=
s=20
for Underwriters Laboratories, the nonprofit testing organization. "I think=
=20
maybe right now in California, in particular, installing transient voltage=
=20
surge suppressors would be a good idea."
?????Surge suppressors don't help at all with a brownout, which is an=20
insufficient flow of electricity through the wires.
?????Brownouts are most often caused by things such as a squirrel shorting=
=20
out a line and can be identified by suddenly dimmed lights. Low voltage can=
=20
seriously damage appliances that use motors--such as refrigerators and air=
=20
conditioners--so if the lights go dim and stay dim, unplug such appliances=
=20
until the power company makes repairs.
?????Items that use electricity to create heat or produce light will contin=
ue=20
to function with little chance of damage; they just won't get as hot or be =
as=20
bright.
?????Some devices, such as computers, will get trashed by low power or sudd=
en=20
loss of power, especially if the power fluctuates while the system is writi=
ng=20
data to the hard drive. Computers should be turned off using the standard=
=20
shutdown procedure for their particular make and model to avoid corruption =
of=20
the operating system, which can create lots of headaches for users.
?????To avoid that, consider an uninterruptible power supply, basically jus=
t=20
a system of rechargeable batteries that's always plugged in to the electric=
al=20
outlet. Plug the components into the UPS, and if the voltage on the line=20
drops or disappears, the juice flows from the batteries to the device.
?????Many of these systems also come with surge suppressors built in as wel=
l,=20
protecting equipment from both too much and too little electricity. A=20
high-end consumer UPS costs less than $200.
?????Most of these systems are designed to safely power down a computer in=
=20
the event of a power outage. They won't provide enough juice for more than =
a=20
few minutes on a standard desktop computer.
?????And of course, the debate about whether some conservation efforts have=
=20
diminishing returns continues. Turning off your computer reduces electricit=
y=20
consumption, but repeatedly turning the computer off and on can stress the=
=20
electronic circuitry, which could cause it to fail sooner.
?????Devices that are pulling down considerably less electricity might eke=
=20
out an hour or two on a UPS. If you find yourself growing increasingly=20
annoyed at having to reset the clock on the VCR or microwave, a=20
consumer-level UPS might provide enough stored power to get you through a=
=20
blackout that lasts an hour or two.
?????Don't plan on watching TV or making popcorn. We're talking strictly=20
about keeping the clock on line, although most people probably won't be=20
interested. "Spending $150 because you don't want to set the clock on the V=

probably won't be very appealing to many people," said James Little, a=20
spokesman for Belkins Components, which makes such devices.
?????And there's no such thing as a free lunch. UPS systems are also a drai=

blackout. So don't look to a UPS as a solution to conservation.
?????What you can do is plug components that can safely be completely shut=

surge suppressors have a kill switch, a button that will cut off all power =

Sacramento -- Gov. Gray Davis threatened last night to seize excess power=
=20
generated by California's municipal utility districts, which he said have=
=20
charged even higher electricity prices than out-of-state generators.=20
Davis said in an interview with The Chronicle that some municipal utility=
=20
districts have charged the state as much as 10 percent more than the averag=
e=20
wholesale cost demanded by private power companies.=20
The governor's tough talk came as California suffered through a Stage 2 pow=
er=20
alert and faced the prospect of a long, hot summer of rolling blackouts and=
=20
skyrocketing electricity prices. So far this year, the state has paid more=
=20
than $8.2 billion to buy power for its cash-strapped utilities.=20
In a variation on his threat to seize power plants from out-of-state=20
generators if they continue gouging California ratepayers, the governor sai=
d=20
he would use his executive powers to claim excess juice from the locally=20
owned utilities if they do not lower their prices.=20
He said he is ready to go to court if they offer resistance.=20
"We're going to get that power one way or another," Davis said.=20
Municipal utilities are city-owned power companies. In Northern California,=
=20
there are municipal utilities in Alameda, Palo Alto, Redding, Sacramento an=
d=20
Santa Clara. Los Angeles has the largest municipal utility in the state.=20
30 DAYS TILL CONTRACT DETAILS=20
For the first time, the governor also gave a time frame for releasing detai=
ls=20
of more than 40 long-term electricity contracts California is signing with=
=20
generators since the financial meltdown of the state's two biggest utilitie=
s.=20
He said that after about six more contracts get nailed down, he expects ful=
l=20
details to be made available within 30 days.=20
Although the contracts involve nearly $40 billion in public funds, Davis an=
d=20
other state officials have adamantly refused to divulge their contents,=20
insisting that secrecy is needed to remain competitive during negotiations.=
=20
The Chronicle and other media outlets have filed suit for access to the=20
contracts, arguing that the public has a right to know how its money is bei=
ng=20
spent.=20
RUDE AWAKENING
While going toe-to-toe with the out-of-state generators, the last thing Dav=
is=20
needed was for municipal utilities -- the home team, as it were -- to emula=
te=20
the Texas big boys and dig deep into California's pockets.=20
Yet the governor's negotiators have been struggling for weeks to convince=
=20
municipals that they are obliged to provide power at cost -- which Davis=20
insisted they are required to do by law.=20
He met last week with the heads of a dozen municipal utilities and told the=
m=20
explicitly that he would not tolerate gouging from within the state as=20
California faces a summer of potential blackouts.=20
The governor said after the meeting that the municipals had agreed "to make=
=20
most of their excess power available this summer . . . at prices=20
significantly lower than those being charged on the spot market."=20
Apparently, however, little progress has been made since that declaration.=
=20
Davis told The Chronicle last night that he is still "trying very hard to=
=20
promote this notion that we're all in this together."=20
While unwilling to specify which municipal utilities have been most=20
aggressive in their pricing, and refusing to place a dollar amount on how=
=20
much the utilities charged, Davis said he is prepared to seize up to 800=20
megawatts of output if the they do not change their ways.=20
Eight hundred megawatts is enough power to light about 800,000 homes.=20
Representatives of the various municipal utilities could not be reached for=
=20
comment, nor could a spokesperson for the California Municipal Utilities=20
Association in Sacramento.=20
"I told them that they will either (reduce their prices) voluntarily or=20
involuntarily," the governor said.=20
UNCERTAIN FUTURE
It remains to be seen, however, whether the municipal utilities will play=
=20
ball. To date, they have shown a firm inclination to go their own way.=20
In March, Lodi's municipal utility district and a Northern California=20
municipal utility cooperative that includes Palo Alto, Santa Clara and=20
Alameda told Pacific Gas and Electric Co. that they will not participate in=
=20
rolling blackouts during power shortages.=20
"I won't arbitrarily screw my customers . . . so 5,000 PG&E customers can=

San Jose mayor changes course, endorses power plant=20

ZAPLER=20
Mercury News=20

After a year of staunch opposition to a major power plant in South San Jose=
,=20
Mayor Ron Gonzales reversed course Wednesday and endorsed the project,=20
removing the largest remaining barrier to construction and angering residen=
ts=20
of a nearby neighborhood he had pledged to protect.=20
Speaking before news cameras and reporters in his City Hall office, Gonzale=
s=20
said he had negotiated an agreement with Calpine that eased his concerns=20
about the Metcalf Energy Center project. The deal, he said, contains=20
provisions to help shield the Santa Teresa neighborhood from air pollution,=
=20
gives local businesses the chance to negotiate below-market electricity rat=
es=20
and provides a sure energy source for local residents.=20
``We need power in San Jose and we believe this power plant is needed in Sa=
n=20
Jose,'' Gonzales said. ``We've worked hard to make this plant better for th=
e=20
neighborhoods and better for the city.''=20
But the city entered talks with Calpine about five weeks ago in a vastly=20
weakened position, and its chief negotiator, mayoral budget director Joe=20
Guerra, was unable to extract most of the concessions the city and=20
neighborhood had sought. Santa Teresa leader Elizabeth Cord called the=20
neighborhood protection provisions ``totally not substantive,'' and another=
=20
opponent said a lawsuit is likely if the plant is ultimately approved.=20
``The mayor's deal does nothing to reduce the impact on this neighborhood,'=
'=20
Santa Teresa activist Issa Ajlouny said. ``It's the same project as it was=
=20
two years ago except San Jose residents will be paying millions of dollars=
=20
more.''=20
Shift by Cisco?=20
Cisco Systems, which is planning a 20,000-worker campus adjacent to the=20
proposed plant and has strenuously opposed it, appears to be softening its=
=20
opposition. Kent Jenkins Jr., a spokesman for the company, said Wednesday=
=20
that Cisco would still prefer not to have the plant, but that officials wer=
e=20
pleased, at first glance, with the health and safety concessions Gonzales h=
ad=20
negotiated. Asked whether Cisco might file a lawsuit, Jenkins said, ``We're=
=20
not ruling anything in or out and by that, I don't want to imply we are=20
considering anything.''=20
He added that the agreement will have no bearing on the company's plans to=
=20
build the campus. ``All along we were committed to pursuing Coyote Valley a=
nd=20
that remains unchanged,'' he said.=20
With experts predicting a summer of rolling blackouts, and with the=20
California Energy Commission expected soon to override the city council's=
=20
November rejection of the plant, Gonzales was under enormous pressure to=20
strike a deal. Polls taken by Calpine had shown overwhelming public support=
=20
for the plant, another ominous sign for the mayor who is up for re-election=
=20
next year.=20
While the city probably could not have blocked approval of the plant once i=
t=20
got state approval, the mayor indicated as late as April?18 that the city=
=20
might fight it in court. But that possibility vanished with Wednesday's=20
announcement, leaving a possible neighborhood-backed lawsuit as the only=20
potential threat.=20
``This power plant is coming to San Jose. That's clear from the support it=
=20
has gathered in Sacramento,'' Gonzales conceded, referring to Gov. Gray=20
Davis' endorsement in April. So rather than continue to fight an uphill=20
battle, Gonzales decided it was best to negotiate what he could.=20
At the news conference, Gonzales touted provisions in the deal that will=20
provide two additional air monitoring stations to ensure the plant complies=
=20
with local air quality standards. The agreement also provides a three-month=
=20

?One key negotiating point was how much Calpine would pay to extend a=20
recycled-water pipeline seven miles to the plant site. The city started by=

asking the company to pay at least $25 million of the roughly $50 million=
=20
price tag. But, in a provision Gonzales touted as a victory, Calpine will p=

20 percent of the cost, or $10 million, and the city will pick up the=20
remaining $40 million. Calpine said the company is simply paying its fair=
=20
share.=20
?In an effort to protect neighborhoods from pollution, the city wanted=20
Metcalf to operate full time, since emissions are highest when a power plan=

A representative for power companies said Thursday that he doubts companies=

Without seeing details of the spending, lawmakers this month approved a=20

reached nearly $8 billion. Critics question whether the state is getting a=

good deal and wonder whether the bonds will cover the costs.=20
Until now, Gov. Gray Davis has answered critics by arguing that revealing t=

``These contracts have been out there for a couple of months and this is an=

The state routinely enters into contracts in other areas, and those contrac=

``Businesses don't reveal their contracts, and the state has gone into the=

The state's power-buying authority ends on that date.=20
News agencies, whose case will be heard Friday, say there's no evidence=20

Alonzo Wickers, a lawyer for the news agencies, including the Mercury News,=

The administration has signed dozens of contracts ranging from several mont=

Even with the contracts already signed, the state still will have to buy ha=

Building a new plant? More power to them=20
May 31, 2001=20
By GORDON DILLOW
Orange=20
County Register=20
As you probably know, the main reason we're in a power crisis in California=
=20
is because we haven't built enough power-generating plants. And one reason =
we=20
haven't built enough plants is NIMBY-ism: When faced with having a new powe=
r=20
plant nearby, most people shout "Not in my back yard!"=20
Well, I just found out that a new power plant is being built in my back yar=
d.=20
And frankly, I think it's a dandy idea.=20
The power plant in question is being built at the county Olinda Alpha=20
Landfill in Brea. The plan is to take the methane gas formed by the natural=
=20
decomposition of refuse in the dump - which ordinarily would have to be=20
flared off -- and burn it in engines to produce electricity. Actually,=20
they've been producing power at the landfill that way for years, but now,=
=20
with power at a premium, a New Jersey-based company called Ridgewood Power=
=20
wants to expand the plant's output by about 50 percent.=20
True, the power plant isn't literally in my back yard; it's a couple of=20
ridgelines away. But it's still close enough for the Air Quality Management=
=20
District to recently send me a letter informing me of increased pollution=
=20
from the plant - and warning me that the plant emissions could cause cancer=
.=20
Now, ordinarily those would be the sort of grim tidings that would cause=20
palpitations in my homeowner's heart. So why am I being so welcoming to my=
=20
new power-generating, air-polluting neighbor?=20
Several reasons. First, it's a pretty tiny power plant. Even with the 50=20
percent production boost, it will only crank out 8 megawatts - enough to=20
provide power to about 8,000 homes, but still less than 1 percent of the=20
juice produced by one reactor at the San Onofre nuclear power plant.=20
Also, the increased air pollution hardly seems like enough to worry about.=
=20
For example, the AQMD says the plant will produce up to 9 pounds of fine=20
particulates per day - which is probably about the same amount of=20
particulates I release into the atmosphere when I burn a steak on the=20
barbecue. And according to the AQMD's calculations, I'd have to suck in the=
=20
plant's air for 70 years to run even a 1-in-1 million risk of developing=20
cancer from the emissions.=20
But the big thing in favor of the landfill power plant is that it's exactly=
=20
the sort of clever power-producing scheme we need right now. It takes=20
something we don't need - the methane from our garbage - and turns it into=
=20
something we desperately need: electric power. These days, every 8 megawatt=
s=20
helps.=20
And now that I think on it, there's another, more personal advantage to=20
having the landfill power plant nearby:=20
Without requiring any real sacrifices on my part, it makes me feel like a=
=20
non-NIMBYist. So when they start looking around for a place to build anothe=
r=20
power plant to help ease the energy crunch, I can strongly suggest - no,=20
demand! -- that they build it in somebody else's back yard.=20
Because I already have one in mine.

Electrical Emergency Stepped Up to Stage Two; Need for Energy Conservation =
is=20
Critical



FOLSOM, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 30, 2001 via NewsEdge Corporation  -
The California
Independent System Operator (California ISO) declared a Stage Two
Electrical Emergency today, Wednesday, May 30, 2001, at 2:00 p.m. with
operating reserves dipping below five percent. A number of factors are
contributing to today's emergency condition:
--  With higher than expected temperatures and the corresponding use


of air conditioning units, the demand for power is trending


approximately 1,200 megawatts over the forecast.
--  Net imports are running at 4,000 megawatts; 3,000 less than last


week.
--  A total of 9,800 megawatts worth of generation remains unavailable


today with power plants off-line because of preventative repairs


and plant malfunctions.


Consumers are asked to step up conservation efforts as the
California ISO's job of balancing the supply and demand for power
becomes more challenging this afternoon and into the evening peak
hours. Demand across the California ISO Control Area is expected to
peak at 36,174 megawatts around 3:00 p.m. this afternoon. Today's
Stage Two Emergency is in effect until midnight. With the Stage Two
declaration, the California ISO is able to access emergency resources
that will help maintain operating reserves.


A Stage Two Emergency is declared when operating reserves dip
below five percent or are expected to within the next two hours. If an
operating reserve shortfall of less than one-and-a-half percent is
unavoidable, Stage Three will be initiated. Involuntary curtailments
of service to customers, including "rotating blackouts," are possible
during this emergency declaration.


The California ISO is charged with managing the flow of
electricity along the long-distance, high-voltage power lines that
make up the bulk of California's transmission system. The
not-for-profit public-benefit corporation assumed the responsibility
in March, 1998, when California opened its energy markets to
competition and the state's investor-owned utilities turned their
private transmission power lines over to the California ISO to manage.
The mission of the California ISO is to safeguard the reliable
delivery of electricity, facilitate markets and ensure equal access to
a 25,526 circuit mile "electron highway."


Information about the California ISO control area's electricity
supply and the current demand is available on the web at
www.caiso.com.

Washington's Role Helped Spark California's Power Crunch



WASHINGTON, May 29, 2001 (States News Service via COMTEX)  via NewsEdge=20
Corporation  - Although it is
popular in Washington to point the finger at California for its energy cris=
is,
the federal government shares a good deal of blame for the California energ=
y
crisis.

In 1995, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission helped lay the foundation=
=20
for
what has become the debacle of the new millenium when it rejected a state p=
lan
calling for new power plants that today would be providing 1,300 megawatts =
in
new electricity.


What's more, records from that year show that the regulatory commission
expressed "grave concerns about the need" for new power generation in the=
=20
state.


Had those power plants been built, they would be generating power for an
estimated 1.3 million homes at the wholesale fixed cost of between 3.5 and =
6.6
cents per kilowatt-hour with binding, long-term contracts.


At the time, retail prices averaged 9 cents per kilowatt-hour, according to=
=20
FERC
documents.


In recent months, wholesale prices have been averaging between 12 cents to =
13
cents per kilowatt-hour, according to California Public Utility Commission
spokesman James Hendry. During peak usage, those prices can reach 20 cents =
to=20
40
cents and at times have rocketed to a record $1.90 since last December.


"Everybody is saying those prices will go higher this summer," Hendry added=
.


Nevertheless, members of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission -- known =
as
FERC -- have regularly blamed California for failing to build new power pla=
nts
to meet present power needs that have sparked energy shortages and higher=
=20
prices
throughout the West.


The commission also shares the widely held view that faulty legislation aim=
ed=20
at
deregulating the state's power industry in 1996 is to blame.


Although FERC put limited price caps into effect on wholesale electricity o=
n
Tuesday, the commission continues to resist broader demands to stabilize=20
prices
in the Western region, as has been sought by California Gov. Gray Davis, an=
d
other lawmakers. They claim that FERC has ignored their responsibility to=
=20
ensure
that electricity rates are "just and fair."


President Bush has sided with FERC's limited price caps because he believes=
=20
that
market-oriented supply and demand is the only sure way to restore permanent
order to the crisis.


The messy trail of the Golden State's rolling blackouts and power failures
passed through Washington in January 1995 when several California utility
companies asked FERC to rule against the state's plans to build power=20
facilities
around the state.


As part of that plan, first announced in 1992, the California Public Utilit=
ies
Commission nailed down bids through a competitive auction process to build =
two
new geothermal plants, one wind farm, and the repowering of an existing ste=
am
plant in Southern California. A "badly needed" gas-powered plant on the San
Francisco Peninsula also was called for.


All would have been up and running by 1999.


Had the plants been build, California's electrical utilities would have bee=
n
required to buy power from them under a long-standing policy first enacted =
by
Congress in 1978, the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act. But two utili=
ty
companies protested, claiming they didn't need more electricity. Besides, t=
hey
said they could provide or purchase cheaper electricity elsewhere if needed=
.


California used "a flawed auction process," recalled Art Larson, spokesman =
for
Sempra Energy, parent company of San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, when asked=
=20
about the
decision. "It didn't consider the least-cost bids," he said, because=20
California
mandated the use of renewable energy.


So, just two months before construction on the plants was to begin, Souther=
n
California Edison and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric filed a protest with FER=
C.=20
The
five-member regulatory commission approves rates for wholesale electric sal=
es=20
of
electricity and transmission in interstate commerce.


Both utility companies argued that because the PUC favored renewable energy
generation, it ignored less expensive ways to provide electricity such as
gas-fired plants and other sources.


Southern California Edison also expressed concerns about California's effor=
ts=20
to
deregulate the electric utility industry that soon would be approved the
following year. Such legislation would likely bring down energy costs, it
predicted.


Other parties also weighed in on the complaint, including the National Coal=
=20
and
Western Fuels Association, which claimed that Edison could purchase power f=
rom
out-of-state sources at 3 cents a kilowatt hour. Today, FERC and other crit=
ics
of California's electricity policies believe that the state relies far too
heavily on out-of-state sources.


California responded to the complaints by noting that it did approve gas=20
powered
turbines in its plans, but also wanted "clean" energy suppliers as part of =
the
state's environmental objectives. After factoring in the costs of controlli=
ng
pollution in California caused by other forms of energy production, the pri=
ce
for electricity provided from alternative sources would be competitive, it=
=20
said.


California's argument fell of deaf ears and FERC sided with the utility
companies. In its ruling, the commission stated that California's auction
procedure violated the standards set by PURPA because the state explicitly
sought out renewable energy providers and ignored other sources in the bidd=
ing
process.


FERC added that "we have grave concerns about the need" for added electrici=
ty=20
in
California. It also cautioned that the fact that the state was moving towar=
d
deregulating the electricity industry, "heightens our concern" about forcin=
g
utility companies into long-term contracts.


FERC's controversial ruling, which was opposed by many independent energy
organizations, still disturbs Loretta Lynch, chairman of the California Pub=
lic
Utilities Commission.


What derailed the effort to build more power "was not the actions of=20
California,
but instead the actions of FERC itself," she said last December when FERC=
=20
first
denied requests to place wholesale price caps on electricity in western sta=

and blamed California for not building enough power plants.


And how do the utility companies now feel about the power plants they fough=

1995 when long-term contracts would have been had for a fraction of the cos=

they are now paying?


"20/20 hindsight is a luxury," responds Larson of Sempra Energy. "But the=

Energy Experts Say Solution to California Crisis is Inescapable/ Build More=
=20
Power Plants and Ensure Competition



ATLANTA--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 30, 2001 via NewsEdge Corporation  -
As the Bush Administration
continues to face harsh criticism in California over perceived
inaction regarding the energy crisis, industry executives appear to be
lining up behind Bush's assertion that enhancing the availability and
reliability of the nation's energy supply is the long-term solution.


And they consider creating more supply while maintaining the
transition to a deregulated marketplace crucial, reports the May issue
of Energy Competition Strategy Report, published by Atlanta-based NHI
Publications.


One leading utility executive says the solution to the nation's
long-term supply problem is inescapable. "We need to build new power
plants. And those new plants will be built only if we allow the
competitive market to do its job," says William Hecht, chairman,
president, and CEO of Allentown, PA-based PPL Corp. Price caps - which
California is pushing for and Bush opposes - "reduce the incentive to
invest in new production and unnecessarily prolong and exacerbate the
current supply and demand mismatch," Hecht adds.


PPL is aggressively developing new power plants in Connecticut,
New York, Pennsylvania, Washington, and Arizona that will add more
than 4,000 megawatts of supply. Other members of the Washington,
DC-based Electric Power Supply Association, such as ABB Energy
Ventures of Switzerland and Zeigler Coal Holding of Ashland, KY, are
building new, unregulated merchant power plants.


Meanwhile, EPSA is asking Congress to enact legislation that would
allow federal eminent domain for transmission siting and establish a
standardized interconnection policy to make it easier for generation
companies to "get onto the grid."

LOS ANGELES, May 30 -- For Evans Keller, a turkey farmer in the Central=20

For 17 years, he and his family have raised turkeys near Fresno, far from t=

use electric fans and fog-making machines to cool his one million turkeys -=

or watch them roast in tin-roofed sheds.=20
But with energy experts forecasting more than 260 hours of blackouts this=
=20
summer and no relief in sight from regulators or politicians, Mr. Keller ha=
s=20
taken matters into his own hands. In April, he bought eight small generator=

Since then he has regularly conducted drills on the 14 farms that supply hi=

has spent weeks winnowing the routine down to 40 minutes, barely enough tim=
e=20
before the birds begin to wither under the searing sun.=20
''Believe me, we're not proud,'' said Mr. Keller, who said he had appealed=

earlier this year, without success, to Pacific Gas and Electric for advance=
=20
warnings of blackouts. ''We'll do what we have to to protect our=20
investment.''=20
The energy crisis here has come to this: from tourist attractions in sunny=
=20
Southern California, to farmers who dominate the central region of the stat=
e,=20
to technology concerns up north, businesses are coming up with novel ways t=
o=20
cope with what many fear will be an unpleasant summer.=20
The concerns are understandable given the issues that many businesses face,=
=20
including lost revenue and potential layoffs, as the state's power shortage=
s=20
continue. ''The uncertainty is what kills you,'' Jerry Meek, utility=20
operations manager at Roche Pharmaceuticals in Palo Alto, said.=20
Trying to reduce that uncertainty, businesses are applying to the state's=
=20
Public Utilities Commission for exemptions from having their power turned o=
ff=20
this summer. (The deadline is Friday.) Last week, Gov. Gray Davis announced=
=20
that the state would begin a three-tiered warning system for residences and=
=20
businesses that are likely to be affected. The first warning will come two=
=20
days before a blackout; the second, one day in advance; and the final=20
warning, one hour before the lights go out.=20
A more radical approach is being suggested by Mike Briggs, a Republican=20
assemblyman from Fresno. He is asking the state to schedule potential=20
blackout days as much as months in advance so business owners know when the=
ir=20
turn is coming. ''It is scary what this has come to,'' Mr. Briggs said. ''B=
ut=20
this gives people options.''=20
Farmers in the Central Valley, for instance, have to order water for their=
=20
crops a day ahead. But if the power is off when the water shows up in an=20
irrigation canal, he said, ''they can't open the gates and the water flows=
=20
right past them.'' One business owner told Mr. Briggs that he spent $30,000=
=20
one month to lease two generators that were never used. ''He said it would=
=20
have been nice to know ahead of time so he could rent the generators for a=
=20
day,'' the assemblyman said.=20
Of course critics worry that burglars will know when the lights go out, too=
.=20
''Yes, there is the downside of more potential burglaries,'' Mr. Briggs sai=
d.=20
''But maybe people are willing to make that trade-off.''=20
Even those business owners who say they are currently protected from power=
=20
failures are making preparations -- just in case. The Legoland California=
=20
amusement park in Carlsbad, near San Diego, has an arrangement with its=20
utility, the San Diego Gas and Electric Company, to keep the lights on, sai=
d=20
a spokeswoman, Courtney Simmons. Still, she added, the park is prepared in=
=20
the event of a loss.=20
The contingency plan consists of keeping open the 3 rides, of the 20 total,=
=20
that are not powered by electricity, she said. Barbecues would be rolled ou=
t=20
to cook food, and the park's boulevards would be flooded with performers,=
=20
including singers, dancers, jugglers and musicians who will entertain until=
=20
the power comes back on. ''We are prepared for outages no matter what the=
=20
cause this summer,'' she said.=20
Many tourist attractions, including Disneyland in Anaheim, are already=20
prepared because they upgraded their systems in 1999, fearing a Year 2000=
=20
disaster that would threaten the power grid. ''A lot of these things were=
=20
already tested and documented,'' said Ray Gomez, director of communications=
=20
at Disneyland Resorts. ''We are skilled at emergency evacuations. Energy is=
=20
only one part of that.''=20
As part of its plan, Disneyland shored up its emergency operations center,=
=20
holding employee drills to turn on emergency power. This summer, Disneyland=
=20
will have employee volunteers who roam the park day and night, turning out=
=20
lights and replacing incandescent bulbs with more energy-efficient ones. Th=
e=20
park also works with the city of Anaheim, which supplies the park with powe=
r,=20
to conserve 5 to 10 percent, minimizing the risk of blackouts at all.=20
Oddly enough, Disneyland is reviving its Main Street Electrical Parade, a=
=20
29-year-old light show that had most recently been an attraction in Florida=
.=20
Leslie Goodman, a senior vice president for strategic communications for Wa=
lt=20
Disney Parks and Resorts, said the park had made sure that the parade did n=
ot=20
use energy when Californians need it most. The lights in the parade are=20
powered by battery, and are recharged during off-peak hours. But, she added=
,=20
despite what was a difficult decision and a potential public relations=20
nightmare, ''the show goes on.''=20
While most businesses make an effort to conserve (if for no other reason th=
an=20
to save money as rates soar), some communities are giving corporations adde=
d=20
incentives. The city of Palo Alto, for example, has agreed not to cut off=
=20
power to Roche Pharmaceuticals as long as the company reduces energy=20
consumption by 15 percent within 30 minutes of an announced Stage 3 alert,=
=20
the state's most critical. Only once has Roche lost power, said Mr. Meek, t=
he=20
company's utility operations manager. And that, he added, was because of a=
=20
mistake.=20
Roche has a plan to ensure that a blackout does not happen. Once Mr. Meek=
=20
gets an alert on his pager from a city representative (who can see how much=
=20
is being saved because the company has a real-time meter for the 15-buildin=
g=20
campus), voice mail and e-mail messages are sent to more than 1,000 employe=
es=20
asking them to turn off nonessential lights. The air-conditioning is change=
d=20
to raise the temperature in most areas to 78 degrees from a normal 72=20
degrees. Lighting in all offices is reduced, and some employees move from=
=20
their dark cubicles to the window-walled cafeteria to work, he said.=20
''The question is, do you treasure light or do you want your computer shut=
=20
down?'' Mr. Meek asked. If these measures do not reduce overall demand by 1=
5=20
percent, Roche will switch on backup generators to power the laboratories.=
=20
Why? If laboratory tools are not properly shut off before a loss of power, =
it=20
takes days to recalibrate them, costing thousands of dollars and wasted tim=
e,=20
Mr. Meek said. ''My focus with the uncertainty is to do what we can to get=
=20
around it,'' he said.=20
One way that California businesses are seeking certainty is by appealing to=
=20
the state's Public Utilities Commission for relief. One commissioner, Carl=
=20
Wood, said in a recent interview that about half the customers who got=20
electricity from the state's three largest utilities were exempt from=20
blackouts because their services were considered essential, like fire=20
stations or hospitals, or because they shared power with an essential sourc=
e.=20
No more than 60 percent of the state's customers can be exempted from=20
blackouts.=20
Recently, an exemption was granted for the Bay Area Rapid Transit District,=
=20
which runs 95 miles of commuter train service in the San Francisco=20
metropolitan area, Mr. Wood said. Pacific Bell Park, home of the San=20
Francisco Giants, has asked for one, too; that request is being reviewed.=
=20
''It can be extremely disruptive and expensive if there are lots of blackou=
ts=20
this summer,'' he said. ''This is a big economic issue.''=20
Just imagine, he said, musing about how the summer could end: ''Disneyland=
