We don't stand a chance...

Can you imagine working for a company that has a little more than 500
employees and has the following statistics:

  *29 have been accused of spousal abuse
  *7 have been arrested for fraud
  *19 have been accused of writing bad checks
  *117 have directly or indirectly bankrupted at leased 2 businesses
  *3 have done time for assault
  *71 cannot get a credit card due to bad credit
  *14 have been arrested on drug-related charges
  *8 have been arrested for shoplifting
  *21 are currently defendants in lawsuits
  *84 have been arrested for drunk driving in the last year

Can you guess which organization this is?

Give up yet?

It's the 535 members of the United States Congress.  The same group that
cranks out hundreds of new laws each year designed to keep the rest of us
in line.  You gotta pass this one on!
