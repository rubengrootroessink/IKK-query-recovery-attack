Jeff, I believe is we decide to refute Bethany McLean's garbage, it will 
probably take the tone of the attachments below.  In fact they are very 
interesting and I know Mark plans to meet with this gentleman next week.  Of 
course, at this point thess documents are completely internal.

Have a great weekend.

Cindy
