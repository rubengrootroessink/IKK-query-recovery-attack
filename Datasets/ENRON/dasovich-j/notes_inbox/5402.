Tannin Salon

One of the most ubiquitous words in wine reviews is "tannin." Wine 
writers never seem to tire of references to "round" tannins, "ripe" 
tannins, "smooth tannins," "tough" tannins, "gentle" tannins, and 
"supple" tannins. It begins to seem that, if you don't understand 
tannin, you don't understand wine (especially red wine). So just what 
the hell is a tannin? 

Tannins are organic compounds in plants, trees, roots, and bark - or, 
in the case of wine, skins, seeds, and stems. Tastewise, tannin 
doesn't impart a flavor but a texture. In concentrated quantities it 
sticks to the inside of your mouth, where it creates a puckering 
sensation - a sensory effect that senior wine.com merchant Tim Gaiser 
likens to that of overbrewed tea. 

"Tannin is astringent," Gaiser explains. "If a wine has too much of 
it, it's out of balance. But tannin isn't a bad thing. It's a 
necessary component for wine to have structure and aging potential." 

In other words, the more tannin a wine has, the better it will age? 
Not necessarily. "If a wine has a lot of tannin that isn't balanced 
by adequate fruit and acidity, it won't age well," says Gaiser. 
"Eventually the fruit will fade, leaving nothing but tannin. Balance 
is the key." 

Winemakers and vineyard managers can control tannin in several ways. 
"Ripeness of grapes dramatically affects the level and quality of 
tannins," says Gaiser. "Wines made from grapes that aren't fully ripe 
often have green, stemmy, hard tannins. Ripe tannins are finer and 
rounder tasting." 

In other words: supple. Given a suitable climate, ripeness (and its 
corollary, flavor development) results from such factors as low 
vineyard yields and long growing seasons, which allow extended 
hang-time for the fruit. 

Tannin quality also depends on the amount of time that a winemaker 
leaves fermenting grape juice ("must") in contact with the skins - a 
process referred to as maceration. 

"One of the main reasons California Cabernets have gotten so much 
better in the last 10 years is that longer maceration times have been 
used," Gaiser says. "What's improved more than anything is texture, 
which speaks specifically to tannin management." In Bordeaux and 
California Cabernet, maceration times commonly last three weeks or 
longer, a period that enables tannins to grow rounder and gentler. 

Tannin isn't usually associated with white wines because they don't 
undergo maceration; they're pressed off the skins right away. (Almost 
all red grape varieties contain clear juice, so the color of red wine 
is attributable solely to extended skin contact.) But some white 
wines do gain tannin from the new oak barrels in which they're aged. 

"A lot of oaky Chardonnays are just as tannic as red wines," Gaiser 
points out. "People don't usually take that into account, which is 
why Chardonnay can be so difficult to pair with food."
