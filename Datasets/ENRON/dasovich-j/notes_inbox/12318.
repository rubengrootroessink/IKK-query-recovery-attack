Jeff:  Per your discussion with Michael.  Here is the Core/Non-Core Analysis 
with the toggle switch for the 25% of Under 20kW going to non-core/75% of 
Under 20kW staying in core, as well as the 50% of Under 20kW going to 
non-core/50% of Under kW staying in core.

Please let me know if you have any questions or revisions to this.

Thank you.

Kortney
