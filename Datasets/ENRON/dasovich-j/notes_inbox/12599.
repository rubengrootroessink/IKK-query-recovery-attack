HEADLINE: ?Pressure Eases for Calif. Governor

BYLINE: ALEXA HAUSSLER


DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif.

BODY:

???Gov. Gray Davis is getting his first glimpse of relief after months
defending the state's soaring electricity prices and rolling blackouts.

??A series of events from plummeting wholesale energy and natural gas prices 
to
the unexpected shift in the U.S. Senate has Davis declaring that the state has
''turned a corner'' in its power woes.

??But the governor, whose popularity ratings have taken a dive in recent
months, must still weather steaming summer months and homeowner reactions to
record-high electricity bills.

??''Some irreparable damage has been done to his image and his popularity,''
said Bruce Cain, director of the Institute of Governmental Studies at the
University of California at Berkeley.

??Two recent statewide polls showed that as electricity rates climbed, Davis'
approval rating plummeted to its lowest marks since he took office in 1998.

??Davis, who is up for re-election next year, is battling his image as a
middle-of-the-road leader and has adopted a confrontational style to deal with
the power crisis.

??In May, he hired high-powered crisis control specialists Chris Lehane and
Mark Fabiani, trained at the Clinton White House and in the Al Gore 
presidential
campaign. He declared ''war'' on Texas-based energy wholesalers.

??Davis also attacked the Bush administration for opposing price controls on
wholesale electricity.

??Soon after, the crisis-weary governor's fortunes shifted.

??Vermont Sen. James Jeffords announced he would defect from the GOP, handing
the majority and committee chairmanships to Democrats who favor price caps on
wholesale electricity. 

??President Bush, criticized for failing to visit California since taking
office, traveled to the state and met with Davis.

??When the state Energy Commission announced that Californians had cut power
use by 11 percent in May over the previous year, Davis declared a personal
victory. He had called for residents and businesses to conserve 10 percent.

??Last week, wholesale electricity prices plunged from more than $500 a
megawatt hour to about $50 a megawatt hour their lowest level in a year while
natural gas prices also dropped.

??Some experts attributed the price spiral to conservation efforts and mild
Western temperatures, which have reduced the need to run air conditioners.

??But the governor's aides argue the declining prices are a direct result of
Davis signing long-term contracts with energy providers.

??''We may still have some difficult days ahead of us in the summer but it's
pretty clear that the governor's strategy has now borne some fruit,'' said 
Garry
South, chief campaign adviser to Davis.

??Still, the energy crisis has battered Davis, once considered a potential
presidential contender in 2004.

??California, heavily reliant on the technology sector, is facing its toughest
budget crunch in years.

??Critics argue Davis has called a premature victory in the energy crisis. The
state has yet to sell $13.4 billion worth of bonds to repay the state for 
power
buys, and California relies heavily on the spot power market to make up for
electricity shortages.

??California Republicans, meanwhile, are fortifying their own campaign
strategy. The state party hired veteran consultant Rob Stutzman to counter
Davis' hiring of Lehane and Fabiani.

??And Stutzman says Davis has little for which to take credit.

??''The governor is like a little kid that breaks his mother's china and then
wants credit for gluing half of it back together,'' Stutzman said.

??Davis' short-term fortunes look promising, however. The state Democrats
control both houses of the Legislature and all but one statewide office.

??Davis also holds strong leads over the two Republicans who have announced
they will challenge him, Secretary of State Bill Jones and Los Angeles
businessman William E. Simon Jr.

??Whoever runs against Davis will find an incumbent with more than $26 million
raised for next year's election and a team of campaign advisers already using
focus groups and polling to gauge public reaction to the power crisis.

HEADLINE: Public furious at 19 percent rate hike;PUC says its hands are tied

BYLINE: Craig D. Rose

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO

BODY:

??California tends to unanimity when it comes to electricity deregulation: The
legislature passed it unanimously in 1996, and people who testified at rate 
hike
hearings yesterday voiced unanimous opposition.

??Speakers at public hearings in San Diego and El Cajon alternately demanded
and implored the California Public Utilities Commission to reject an average 
19
percent rate hike that the commission says it is obligated by state law to 
pass
along to SDG&E electricity customers.

??Perhaps the loudest applause from an audience that approached 100 at the
downtown San Diego hearing yesterday afternoon came in response to calls for 
the
state to exercise its power of eminent domain and seize power plants.

??Guy Mock, a Navy enlisted man who was among those calling for such 
takeovers,
said many in military service are finding rising utility costs a significant
burden, pushing some to use food stamps.

??''Remember, people in the military have no choice about being here,'' Mock
said.

??Waving computer printouts from research he said he conducted on the 
Internet,
Mock said generators were charging outrageous prices, noting in particular the
recent revelation that at one point Duke Energy had charged nearly $3,900 a
megawatt-hour for its electricity. Last spring, a megawatt-hour sold for less
than $30.

??''Let's take it over,'' Mock suggested as a solution to the power crisis.

??An overflow crowd of about 250 people attended a hearing at the El Cajon
Community Center that at times took on the flavor of a church revival. 
Audience
members cheered, clapped and called out comments in support of almost 50 
people
who spoke at the hearing.

??''There are a couple of hundred here who are very irritated,'' said Chris
Medicus of El Cajon. He said he has been conserving energy even before calls 
to
cut back on power use.

??''Who's going to do something for me since I can conserve no more?''

??Edy Mason, a retired nurse who lives in El Cajon, said she can't afford her
rising rent and utility bills on the $732 she receives each month.

??''This is legal rape. I'm tired of being raped. This has to stop,'' Mason
said.

??Dan McKenna, chief of the Rural Fire Protection District that serves
unincorporated areas of the county, said fire and emergency medical services
will be hurt if there is a rate increase. Fire departments are already having 
to
spend large portions of their budgets on energy costs, he said.

??''That's unacceptable, sir,'' he said as members of the audience clapped and
called out, ''That's right.''

??Despite the appeals for tough action, Carl Wood, the only member of the
California Public Utilities Commission in attendance at yesterday's hearings,
insisted that the commission was obligated to pass along the proposed 19 
percent
rate hike demanded by the California Department of Water Resources.

??Under legislation passed earlier this year, the department began purchasing
power for state utility customers. The same legislation gave the department 
the
right to self-judge the reasonableness of its rate hike requests, a function
formerly allocated to the utilities commission.

??That leaves the PUC with a limited role in the rate hike process, Wood
acknowledged.

??''We are here to spread the pain,'' said the commissioner, who noted that
customers who use 130 percent or less of the baseline amount are shielded from
any rate hike by state law. The baseline allowance, which is printed on 
utility
bills, is a subsistence amount of electricity that varies by location and
climate.

??But Wood also said later, ''We have to (raise rates) if we want to keep 
power
flowing.''

??San Diego County Supervisor Dianne Jacob was not persuaded. Jacob said the
duty of the commission is to ensure just and reasonable utility rates for
Californians.

??''The only way for the commission to fulfill its mission is to disobey the
(water department),'' Jacob said. ''I urge the commission to refuse the $915
million rate increase request from the DWR.''

??Nearly all other speakers agreed, with many blasting the notion that
consumers should be forced to pay for the fallout of a deregulation plan they
said was designed by major energy corporations for their own benefit.

??''They spent the money, they had the party and now they are asking the 
little
guys to clean up the mess,'' said Frank Jordan.

??Another speaker said the utilities commission would find options to the rate
hike if it tapped into public outrage over the electricity crisis.

??''Don't throw more money at the problem,'' said Robert Womack of La Mesa.
''Give us the chance to throw our weight around and we have plenty of weight 
to
throw around.''

??Holly Duncan of San Diego was as upset over the rate hike process as she was
over the increase itself. Duncan noted that the water department which in 
effect
ordered the rate hike was declining to release its power purchase contracts.
That left her, she said, in the position of paying for something that was
negotiated in secret.

??''Where is our systems of checks and balances?'' Duncan asked.

??The commission is expected to have a proposed rate hike plan ready by June
21, with a final vote on the increase slated for June 28.

??Additional public hearings will be held at 1 p.m. today at the Country Inn
Hotel, 35 Via Pico Plaza, San Clemente, and at 7 p.m. today at the California
Center for the Arts, Escondido, 340 N. Escondido Blvd.

Williams May Be Required to Refund $11 Million for Power

BYLINE: Nancy Rivera Brooks

BODY:

??A major electricity marketer in California, Williams Cos., said Monday that
it may be required to refund $11 million for electricity sold in the state 
this
year at prices deemed too high by federal regulators.

??Williams of Tulsa, Okla., markets nearly 4,000 megawatts of electricity 
produced by three Southern California power plants owned by AES Corp. of
Arlington, Va.

??Williams has been ordered by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to
justify prices for $30 million of electricity sold in California during Stage 
3
power emergencies from January to April.

??FERC set a price cap for times of extreme electricity shortages during each
of those four months and found that prices charged by power plant owners and
marketers, including Williams, exceeded the caps by $124.6 million in all. The
companies were told to justify those prices or refund them.

??"Williams has filed justification for its prices with the FERC and 
calculated
its refund liability under the methodology used by the FERC to compute refund
amounts at approximately $11 million," Williams said in a filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. Williams said it continues to object to
refunds in any amount.

HEADLINE: Edison Devises Complex Debt Restructuring Plan;
Energy: New subsidiary created to sell bonds would issue the proceeds as
dividends to the parent of utility SCE.

BYLINE: JERRY HIRSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER

BODY:

??Edison International plans to raise $1.2 billion in a complex transaction
that would tap the borrowing capacity of its only significant profit center--a
move critical to the firm's financial health.

??The financing would pay off $618 million in Edison bank debt that comes due
June 30. Additionally, the offering would be used to pay off $600 million of
floating rate notes due by year's end.

??Mission Energy Holding Co., a company created by Edison International for 
the
sole purpose of issuing these bonds, will offer the notes. The assets of 
Edison
Mission Energy, a subsidiary that owns a network of power plants across the
United States and in Asia, Australia and New Zealand, will secure the debt.

??Mission Energy Holding plans to issue the proceeds to Rosemead-based Edison
International in the form of dividends, giving the parent company funds to pay
off a substantial portion of its debt.

??Despite the backing of such heavy hitters as Wall Street investment bank
Goldman Sachs Group, some analysts question whether there is enough investment
interest to make the deal work.

??"I am not sure what type of appetite the market will have for this," said 
Jon
Cartwright, a bond analyst with Raymond James & Associates in St. Petersburg,
Fla.

??The financing plan comes as the firm is struggling to keep its ailing
Southern California Edison electric utility out of Bankruptcy Court. Edison
International can pursue the deal because of its byzantine corporate 
structure,
designed to reduce the risk that Edison Mission Energy would be dragged into 
any
potential bankruptcy of either the parent company or corporate sibling SCE.

??The question, Cartwright said, is whether that separation, erected under a
financial legal doctrine called "ring fencing," provides enough protection to
make lending money palatable to investors.

??"What price are you willing to get for a security that looks like it will
have to be tested in Bankruptcy Court?" Cartwright asked.

??Edison International, which declined to comment about the offering, plans to
start pitching it on Wall Street this week.

??Even if the offering were completed, Edison International probably would pay
a high price for its borrowing.

??Cartwright said a similarly rated bond at another company would pay an
interest rate of about 9.67%, but given the risk he would expect investors to
demand a higher yield.

??The notes will have a credit rating of BB-minus and come due in 2008, said
Standard & Poor's, the bond rating agency. That's slightly higher than the
near-default CC rating now carried by Edison International.

??Standard & Poor's said the transaction could raise Edison International's
credit rating to a CCC-plus grade--better but still considered a junk rating 
by
the investment community.

??In issuing its rating for the offering Monday, Standard & Poor's said that
"the prospects of a bankruptcy filing by or against SCE remain high."

??That reflects the rating agency's assessment that it is increasingly 
unlikely
that the state will complete a rescue plan devised by Edison and Gov. Gray
Davis, which calls for the state to purchase SCE's transmission lines for 
nearly
$2.8 billion and issue up to $3.5 billion in ratepayer-secured bonds to pay 
off
debts from purchasing electricity at higher rates than it was allowed to 
charge
customers.

??Edison International shares closed unchanged Monday at $11 on the New York
Stock Exchange. The stock has fallen 30% this year.

HEADLINE: Davis Eases Power Plant Pollution Rules;
Electricity: Order will allow more production from heavily polluting 'peaker'
facilities.

BYLINE: DAN MORAIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO

BODY:

??Gov. Gray Davis agreed Monday to lift air emission limits on heavily
polluting power plants and allow them to run at capacity this summer as long 
as
the electricity they produce is sold in the state.

??State officials said the plants must be pressed into use to avoid blackouts.

??Davis' executive order lets the generators build the cost of air pollution
fines into the price the state pays for electricity produced by natural
gas-fired power plants, said Catherine Witherspoon of the California Air
Resources Board.

??Municipal utility districts--including the Los Angeles Department of Water
and Power--and independent power companies could supply as much as 1,200
megawatts from so-called peaker plants, facilities that generally are 
permitted
to operate for only a few hundred hours a year because they pollute so 
heavily.
That is enough power for more than 1 million homes.

??Other gas-fired power plants that have been shut down because of air
pollution restrictions also could be started up as a result of the order.

??In a news conference Monday, state officials said the order will have the
effect of lowering air pollution by limiting the use of far dirtier diesel
generators, which industry could use if power supplies are threatened.

??"If we don't get every last megawatt we can [from natural gas-fired 
plants],"
said Witherspoon of the air board, "we will see people turning to diesel more
frequently."

??Added Kellan Fluckiger, a top energy advisor to Davis: "If you don't run
these, you're either going to have outages or you're going to run something
dirtier."

??Fluckiger said the order expands "the number of hours these things can run
and the amount of energy they can produce."

??New natural gas-fired power plants emit about half a pound per megawatt-hour
of operation of ozone-producing pollutants. The plants affected by the order
emit between two and five pounds of oxides of nitrogen per megawatt-hour.

??If the plants are pressed into operation for 200,000 megawatt-hours this
summer, there will be between 400,000 and 1 million additional pounds of 
oxides
of nitrogen emitted into the air.

??The state probably will end up paying the fees associated with the extra
pollution through higher electricity prices. The fees amount to $7.50 per 
pound
of oxides of nitrogen--or $7.5 million if the plants operate for 200,000
hours--and $1.10 per pound of carbon monoxide emissions. The money would be 
used
to reduce air pollution from other sources.

??"Under this order, dirty power plants can run as long as they want and
pollute as much as they want so long as they pay into a fund," said Gail
Ruderman Feuer, senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council. 
"Our
concern is that there's no guarantee that the fund will result in emission
reductions any time soon."

??A Ventura County air pollution control official said that running one 
peaking
power plant operated by Reliant Energy for one hour is the equivalent of 
adding
20,000 new cars to Ventura County highways for an hour. Reliant Energy could 
not
be reached for comment Monday night.

??"To the extent that they run when not needed for an emergency, it's going to
put more air pollution into Ventura County skies and it's going to make our 
air
dirtier," said Dick Baldwin, air pollution control officer for Ventura County.

??Los Angeles DWP Director David Wiggs hailed the order, saying it was needed
so the city can sell the state as much as 1,000 megawatts of power this 
summer.

??"This was the issue we had to have solved or we could not offer any of our
excess capacity to the state," Wiggs said.

??He added, however, that the city and state have not yet agreed on a price 
for
the power. Wiggs said the city is "negotiating to get our cost as low as we 
can
legally charge" so that customers of the city utility district are not
subsidizing consumers in the rest of the state. Municipal utility districts
elsewhere in the state also are expected to benefit from the order.

??Though the order was aimed at spurring municipal utilities to sell power to
the state, it also applies to independent power producers such as Reliant 
Energy
of Houston and Duke of North Carolina--both of which have called on Davis to
ease air pollution restrictions on their old natural gas-fired facilities.

??"This puts more money in the Texans' pockets and more air pollution in
Ventura County residents' lungs," said Baldwin of Ventura County.

??Doug Allard, a Santa Barbara County air pollution control officer, also said
it seems as if the governor is giving private power generators much of what 
they
had sought.

??"We have serious concerns about the order," said Feuer of the Natural
Resources Defense Council. "It's taking the discretion away from local air
districts to regulate power plants in their region."

HEADLINE: Bush to Insist on Ethanol Use in California

BYLINE: ?By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 11

BODY:

??The Bush administration has decided to force California to use ethanol as an
antipollution fuel additive, a move that the critics say could result in an
increase of at least 5 cents a gallon at the pump this summer in that state.

??California had asked the federal government to be exempted from a Clean Air
Act requirement to use fuel additives like ethanol to cleanse its gasoline,
arguing that cheaper technologies were available.

???Administration officials said today that the government would issue a
decision on Tuesday denying the request.

??Last Friday, in a speech in Iowa, Mr. Bush hinted at the decision, saying he
supported the use of ethanol "not only to reduce dependency on foreign sources
of energy but secondly as a way to clean the air."

??Several Democratic senators from farm states, including Tom Daschle of South
Dakota, the new majority leader, and Tom Harkin of Iowa, the new chairman of 
the
Agriculture Committee, saw a favorable decision as a huge boon to their 
states'
economies and had urged Mr. Bush to deny California the waiver.

??It was Mr. Daschle -- and former Senator Bob Dole of Kansas -- who began the
push for ethanol a decade ago by inserting in the Clean Air Act an amendment
that required 2 percent of cleaner-burning gasoline to contain oxygenates like
ethanol.

??The act required that it be sold in cities with the worst smog: Los Angeles,
New York, Baltimore, Chicago, Hartford, Houston, Milwaukee, Philadelphia,
Sacramento and San Diego.

??Some California fuel has oxygenates throughout the year, but in most
Northeastern states the additives are used only in the winter months to reduce
emissions of carbon monoxide.

??The decision opens up the biggest market in the country to corn producers
and, in particular, could benefit the Archer Daniels Midland agribusiness, a
major Republican contributor, because it is one of the few ethanol producers
able to transport ethanol to the West and East Coasts.

??But environmentalists say there are now less expensive, less complex ways to
reduce such pollution than adding ethanol.

??And they contend that Mr. Bush's decision is intended to solidify his 
support
in the farm states that he won in the last election and help him make an
important overture to Iowa, which he lost.

??Several Northeast states were waiting to see whether California received its
waiver before applying for their own, but a spokesman for a consortium of 
those
states said today that they would not apply and without it would expect to see
an increase in gasoline prices.

??Gov. Gray Davis of California, who has already clashed with the White House
over its energy policy and its refusal to place price caps on electricity, 
said
the decision could cost Californians, who already pay the highest gas prices 
in
the nation, an additional 6 cents per gallon, or about $450 million a year for
the estimated 580 million gallons of ethanol that will be needed annually.

??Janet Hathaway, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council, with a
specialty in fuels and vehicles, said the decision "means that the whole 
country
has to use ethanol in every gallon of reformulated gas, which means suddenly a
lot of demand has to chase a limited supply, which always means prices go up."

??Ms. Hathaway added, "It's not necessary to use ethanol to achieve the same
environmental results."

??There are basically two widely available additives, or oxygenates, that help
cleanse gasoline -- ethanol and M.T.B.E. (methyl tertiary butyl ether). But
M.T.B.E. has been found to contaminate drinking water and is being phased out 
in
11 states, including California and much of the Northeast.

??The administration's expected decision would force those states instead to
use ethanol, an alcohol made by the fermentation of sugars from corn, which 
last
year constituted two-thirds of 1 percent of the gasoline produced in this
country.

??California argued two years ago to the Environmental Protection Agency that
it wanted a waiver from such a mandate because refiners had other ways to 
blend
gasoline that were cheaper and cleaner.

??The agency under the Clinton administration decided to grant the waiver,
concluding that it would reduce emissions, but President Bill Clinton never
completed action on the matter.

??David Uchic, a spokesman for the National Corn Growers Association, said he
doubted California's claim of cheaper, cleaner blends.

??"If you want to tell us you can refine a gas that meets the Clean Air
standards and is cheaper than ethanol-added enhanced gas, go ahead," Mr. Uchic
said. "Let's see the numbers."

??In addition, he said the Bush decision was a flat-out victory for his
industry, which hopes to triple ethanol production over the next decade.

??"This will spur new investment in ethanol plants and in expanding existing
facilities, and we just see production going up, up, up," Mr. Uchic said.

??Jason Grumet, executive director of the Northeast States for Coordinated Air
Use Management, a consortium of state agencies, said the
administration's decision was ill-conceived and potentially harmful. ?"We will
be paying more money for higher-polluting gasoline," Mr. Grumet said. "This 
is a
decision that will profoundly benefit a couple of multinational agribusinesses
at the expense of the environment, drivers and the small farmer."

DAVIS ORDER: They can run overtime

SOURCE: Chronicle Sacramento Bureau

BYLINE: Robert Salladay, Lynda Gledhill

BODY:
Gov. Gray Davis eased California's air pollution standards for power plants
yesterday with an executive order that will allow some to run overtime this
summer and squeeze out extra electricity.

???Energy advisers said the governor's order actually would cause less
pollution in the coming months because it allows natural-gas powered plants to
run longer and reduce the need to run dirtier diesel-powered generators often
used as backups.

???"If you don't run these, you're either going to have outages, or you're
going to run something dirtier," said Davis adviser Kellan Fluckiger.

???Under the current state of emergency, the governor has sweeping powers to
make changes in the law.

???The Davis administration roughly estimated that about 1,200 megawatts in
extra power could be produced and sold to California, enough to supply an
estimated 1.2 million homes. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power,
which has been selling its extra electricity to the state, said it might be 
able
to supply 1,000 megawatts alone.

???Under the current law, power plants in California are allowed to emit
specific amounts of major pollutants -- nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide --
and then must shut down when they reach a federal and state quota.

???The executive order allows power plants in California to bypass those
environmental standards as long as they sell the extra power to the state or
another California-based utility. The order lasts until Davis rescinds it.

???EXEMPTION TRADE-OFFS

???In exchange for the exemptions, the power generators must pay penalties for
the extra pollution they cause. The fines would probably range around $37.50 
for
every megawatt produced during these peak periods, according to Catherine
Witherspoon with the California Air Resources Board.

???Although prices are falling, a megawatt hour has sold on the daily market
for more than $500 -- at one point soaring to as much as $1,900.

???Money from the fines would be put into local pollution-control accounts and
used to reduce emissions elsewhere, Witherspoon said. She said the governor's
order was the best way to get more power and still maintain environmental
standards.

???Witherspoon said the federal Environmental Protection Agency, which needs 
to
approve the new standards set by Davis, had been "very cooperative."

???"Bringing the maximum amount of power out of natural gas capacity is really
going to help," Witherspoon said. "If we don't get every last megawatt we can,
we will see people turning to diesel more frequently."

???The South Coast Air Quality District, which is the largest and most 
polluted
area of the state, already has been allowing power plants to produce more 
power
in exchange for higher fines, said Ralph Cavanagh of Natural Resources Defense
Council.

???"The key is whether the mitigation fund being set up will actually be used
to offset pollution," he said. The "jury is still out" on how successful the
program has been, Cavanagh said.

???Cavanagh agreed that using natural gas plants was much better than diesel,
something the Davis administration is considering. "Clearly we want to 
suppress
the operation of diesel," he said. "To the extent that it reduces diesel, that
is a benefit."

???The state's municipal utilities have for months been asking Davis for
yesterday's exemption so they can run their natural-gas-powered plants longer,
and presumably make some money off the increase in sales. Power prices are at
their highest in history.

???Davis has previously threatened the public utilities takeover because of 
the
high prices being charged the state, which has spent about $8.3 billion to
purchase power since January. The utilities have said they are only passing
along the high cost of the natural gas used to produce the electricity.

???"This was the issue we had to have solved or we could not offer any of our
excess capacity to the state," said David Wiggs, general manager of the L.A.
Department of Water and Power.

???The price of the extra power is "being negotiated now with the governor's
people at the direction of Mayor (Richard) Riordan to get the cost as low as
possible," Wiggs said. "We have not reached an agreement."

NATURAL GAS: Charges of price fixing

SOURCE: Chronicle Staff Writers

BYLINE: Bernadette Tansey, Zachary Coile

BODY:
Federal regulators widened their investigation yesterday of a Texas natural 
gas
firm accused of inflating statewide energy prices, reversing an earlier order
that had partially exonerated the company.

???The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's 4-to-0 ruling in the
investigation of El Paso Corp., backed by Pat Wood, the Bush
administration's new appointee, was greeted by California's chief energy
regulator as a turning point in the commission's attitude toward state
complaints of price gouging.

???The commission's action "signals a whole new chapter of vigilant
enforcement," said Loretta Lynch, president of the state Public Utilities
Commission.

???The federal commission reopened the question of whether El Paso rigged the
bid for a huge block of capacity on its gas pipeline in favor of its own
marketing affiliate, thus stifling competition that could have prevented 
natural
gas prices from soaring to the levels they reached last winter.

???In the past year, gas from the Southwest has sold at the California border
at prices as much as 10 times the nationwide average, driving up the price of
consumers' heating bills and of electricity produced at power plants that run 
on
natural gas.

???In March, before Wood was appointed, the commission cleared El Paso of
complaints by California officials that the firm had engineered the takeover 
by
its marketing arm of more than one-third of the space on its pipeline into
California. That pipeline supplies half of the state's gas.

???In the same ruling, however, the commission ordered a trial-like hearing on
the separate question of whether El Paso exercised near-monopoly market power 
to
boost its profits.

???The PUC, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison say El
Paso's pipeline affiliate and its marketing subsidiary combined to prevent
competing shippers from importing natural gas, jacking up prices.

???The hearing, which has already stretched from an original schedule of four
days to more than five weeks, will now be expanded for evidence on accusations
that l Paso broke federal regulations against preferential treatment for
affiliates.

???COMPANY NOT WORRIED

???El Paso spokeswoman Norma Dunn said the probe would reinforce the
commission's original decision that El Paso was innocent of rigging the 
pipeline
bid.

???"We're confident they'll use the same information to reach the same
conclusion," Dunn said.

???Harvey Morris, the PUC's lead attorney in the case, said the order could
lead to harsher penalties against El Paso if an administrative law judge found
wrongdoing.

???Lynch said last week that El Paso should be forced to pay back California
for what the state considers its excess costs during the 15-month contract
between the company and its marketing arm, El Paso Merchant Energy. The state
has never estimated that figure, but consultants for Edison say the alleged
market manipulation cost California an extra $3.7 billion.

???The PUC first asked the federal commission to void the contract in April
2000. By the time the commission ordered a hearing, the contract was close to
its expiration date -- this past May 31.

???Wood, who was sworn in to the commission last week, said in a concurring
opinion yesterday that such cases should be investigated promptly.

???"In the framework of active energy markets, it is critical that the
commission act expeditiously on complaints," Wood wrote.

???RAISING THE BAR

???Wood's remark "seems to raise the bar for FERC" in its role as a market
watchdog, Lynch said.

???There has been much speculation about how Wood's presence will affect the
federal commission, which has been at odds with California officials over
virtually every area of energy policy.

???Wood, a 38-year-old lawyer, was nominated to the Texas Public Utilities
Commission by then-Gov. George W. Bush in 1995. At the time, Bush said that 
Wood
"shares my conservative philosophy" and would bring a free-market approach to
regulation.

???Bush administration officials have hinted that Wood will replace Curt 
Hebert
as chairman of the federal commission, though White House spokesman Ari
Fleischer dampened the speculation last week, saying Hebert was not in danger 
of
losing his job.

???On his recent trip to the state, Bush said he had assigned Wood to
investigate the high cost of natural gas delivered to California.

???Wood has spoken to Gov. Gray Davis twice on the phone about the energy
crisis. The two plan to meet in Washington on June 20, said Steve Maviglio, a
spokesman for Davis.

???"The governor was enthusiastic about Pat Wood after his conversations with
him," Maviglio said. "He feels the commissioner understands the issues out 
here,
and he promises to provide some relief in one form or another."

???Davis declined to comment on yesterday's decision until he had time to read
it.

???The PUC's Morris said that it was no coincidence that gas prices in
California had dropped dramatically since El Paso Merchant Energy's contract
expired May 31, and 30 competing shippers started to share the pipeline
capacity.

???"It's no longer the 800-pound gorilla on the El Paso system," Morris said.

???El Paso spokeswoman Dunn said prices had dropped because of a wide range of
factors, including mild weather, increased hydroelectric power production and 
a
lower demand for gas.E-mail Bernadette Tansey at btansey@sfchronicle.com. and

HEADLINE: Whining in the Dark

BODY:


???California Gov. Gray Davis [op-ed, May 16] asserted that California's 
energy
crisis is a result of the federal government's failure to "carry out [its]
statutory obligation to ensure energy prices are 'just and reasonable.' "

???Nonsense.

???For 12 years, by Gov. Davis's own admission, California has not built a
major power plant within its borders. Instead, it has exported pollution to 
the
other states (where does that lovely "green" electricity come from?) and 
patted
itself on the back for its environmental "consciousness."

???Now Gov. Davis says, "The federal government must do its part to 
temporarily
control runaway energy prices." Again, nonsense. The "runaway energy prices"
California pays are a direct result of a conscious decision to export 
pollution
to its neighboring states for 12 years.

???And, it should be pointed out, demanding that the federal government
institute "temporary" price controls is the equivalent of demanding that the
rest of the states pay for accepting California's pollution.

???Until California brings its own generators on line -- and the
refining-pipeline capacity to fuel them -- let it whine in the dark. It won't
freeze.

HEADLINE: 'Blackout' sheds some light on spike in energy costs

BYLINE: By Steve Johnson, Tribune media critic.

BODY:

??You are reading this, I presume, with the lights on. Don't get too
comfortable with that idea.

??The very timely "Frontline" episode titled "Blackout" (9 p.m., WTTW-Ch. 11)
examines the new circumstances that led to California's energy crisis, in
particular, but also the natural-gas price spike that made last winter so long
and costly in Illinois.

??The episode, reported with The New York Times, suggests very strongly that
what happened in the Golden State was not simply another case of isolated
left-coast kookiness, like est, but rather a case of left-coast kookiness 
likely
to spread to the rest of the country, like salad bars.

??It is, in other words, a cautionary tale, and then some. The take from
correspondent Lowell Bergman -- yes, the fellow from "The Insider" who used to
be a top "60 Minutes" producer -- blames free-market theory mixed with the 
basic
business principle of trying to make as much money as you can. Electricity
deregulation and other legal developments paved the way for a new class of
businesspeople, ones who trade power like any other commodity. Regulatory
agencies, meanwhile, have either had their teeth taken away or have lost the
will to use them.

??The effect was especially profound in California because a deregulation bill
that satisfied neither free marketers nor public-interest groups had forced
power companies to get rid of their generating plants. They were at the mercy 
of
the markets, the markets found a way to charge more, and that -- again, in
Bergman's take -- is why the cost of electricity jumped by more than a 
multiple
of 10.

??At the heart of this debate is the question of whether the nation can afford
to treat power like soybeans. The California evidence suggests not, but
Bergman's interviews, including one with Vice President Richard Cheney, 
suggest
this administration will continue to follow the free-market path that,
coincidentally, helps some of its biggest campaign donors.

??Two side notes:

??- It is fascinating to see Bergman, who used to be a resolutely behind-the-
scenes guy, take so readily to appearing on camera. He makes sure to include
some of his best moments as a questioner, even when they're not necessarily 
key
to the story. Mike Wallace, his old partner, would be proud, but it's a
different style than "Frontline" viewers are used to, where the correspondent
stays out of the way.

??- This "Frontline" received heavy advance publicity before it aired last
Tuesday on most PBS stations nationwide. WTTW says the episode was a late
addition to the "Frontline" schedule and the station was already locked into
pledge programming at that time.

HEADLINE: Political pressure eases for California Gov. Gray Davis as power
prices dip

BYLINE: By ALEXA HAUSSLER, Associated Press Writer

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif.

BODY:

??Gov. Gray Davis is getting his first glimpse of relief after months 
defending
the state's soaring electricity prices and rolling blackouts.

??A series of events - from plummeting wholesale energy and natural gas prices
to the unexpected shift in the U.S. Senate - has Davis declaring that the 
state
has "turned a corner" in its power woes.

??But the governor, whose popularity ratings have taken a dive in recent
months, must still weather steaming summer months and homeowner reactions to
record-high electricity bills.

??"Some irreparable damage has been done to his image and his popularity," 
said
Bruce Cain, director of the Institute of Governmental Studies at the 
University
of California at Berkeley.

??Two recent statewide polls showed that as electricity rates climbed, Davis'
approval rating plummeted to its lowest marks since he took office in 1998.

??Davis, who is up for re-election next year, is battling his image as a
middle-of-the-road leader and has adopted a confrontational style to deal with
the power crisis.

??In May, he hired high-powered crisis control specialists Chris Lehane and
Mark Fabiani, trained at the Clinton White House and in the Al Gore 
presidential
campaign. He declared "war" on Texas-based energy wholesalers.

??Davis also attacked the Bush administration for opposing price controls on
wholesale electricity.

??Soon after, the crisis-weary governor's fortunes shifted.

??Vermont Sen. James Jeffords announced he would defect from the GOP, handing
the majority and committee chairmanships to Democrats who favor price caps on
wholesale electricity. 

??President Bush, criticized for failing to visit California since taking
office, traveled to the state and met with Davis.

??When the state Energy Commission announced that Californians had cut power
use by 11 percent in May over the previous year, Davis declared a personal
victory. He had called for residents and businesses to conserve 10 percent.

??Last week, wholesale electricity prices plunged from more than $500 a
megawatt hour to about $50 a megawatt hour - their lowest level in a year -
while natural gas prices also dropped.

??Some experts attributed the price spiral to conservation efforts and mild
Western temperatures, which have reduced the need to run air conditioners.

??But the governor's aides argue the declining prices are a direct result of
Davis signing long-term contracts with energy providers.

??"We may still have some difficult days ahead of us in the summer but it's
pretty clear that the governor's strategy has now borne some fruit," said 
Garry
South, chief campaign adviser to Davis.

??Still, the energy crisis has battered Davis, once considered a potential
presidential contender in 2004.

??California, heavily reliant on the technology sector, is facing its toughest
budget crunch in years.

??Critics argue Davis has called a premature victory in the energy crisis. The
state has yet to sell $13.4 billion worth of bonds to repay the state for 
power
buys, and California relies heavily on the spot power market to make up for
electricity shortages.

??California Republicans, meanwhile, are fortifying their own campaign
strategy. The state party hired veteran consultant Rob Stutzman to counter
Davis' hiring of Lehane and Fabiani.

??And Stutzman says Davis has little for which to take credit.

??"The governor is like a little kid that breaks his mother's china and then
wants credit for gluing half of it back together," Stutzman said.

??Davis' short-term fortunes look promising, however. The state Democrats
control both houses of the Legislature and all but one statewide office.

??Davis also holds strong leads over the two Republicans who have announced
they will challenge him, Secretary of State Bill Jones and Los Angeles
businessman William E. Simon Jr.

??Whoever runs against Davis will find an incumbent with more than $26 million
raised for next year's election and a team of campaign advisers already using
focus groups and polling to gauge public reaction to the power crisis.

HEADLINE: State seeks electric rate hike for SDG&E customers

BYLINE: By SETH HETTENA, Associated Press Writer

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO

BODY:

??While resident after resident rose in outrage over the state's ongoing 
energy
crisis, Gail Hoover stood in the hallway outside the public hearing, begging 
for
money.

??Through tears, the 52-year-old single disabled mother from El Cajon said 
this
is what California's energy crisis has driven her to. On top of her folding
table sits family photos and a gift bag that reads, "A donation would be 
greatly
appreciated."

??Hoover said electricity is essential to her well-being. She needs power to
keep her medicine cool and to work her electric hospital bed. And because her
disability check isn't enough to pay all the expenses, Hoover said she has no
choice but to ask strangers for help pay her $300 San Diego Gas & Electric 
bill.

??"We don't have money for anything but food," she said Monday. "My children
are so ashamed we have to do this."

??San Diegans were the first in the state to pay out of control power prices
and they will soon experience another first - an electric rate hike imposed by
the state.

??The California Department of Water Resources, which recently took over
electricity buying for the state's cash-strapped utilities, is raising San 
Diego
Gas & Electric rates 19 percent to collect $915 million the agency says it 
needs
to make those purchases. The rate hike was the subject of a public hearing
Monday, where residents like Hoover had the opportunity to tell state 
regulators
how they felt about such increases.

??Customers of SDG&E were the first to be exposed to unrestricted power prices
under the state's 1996 deregulation law, which is widely blamed for the 
current
energy crisis. After local residents saw their power bills double and triple
last summer, the California Legislature stepped in last fall and froze bundled
rates at about 15 cents a kilowatt hour.

??The DWR will raise rates on average by 2.77 cents per kilowatt-hour to 17.87
cents a kilowatt-hour, according to the Public Utilities Commission. A
kilowatt-hour is enough to light 10 100-watt lamps for one hour.

??SDG&E, which serves 1.2 million customers in San Diego and Orange counties,
has a separate request to raise rates an additional 16 percent or 2.3 cents 
per
kilowatt-hour, pending before the PUC. The utility says the increase would 
raise
$800 million to cover losses it incurred paying skyrocketing prices of
electricity before the DWR began buying power in January.

??Typically, requests for rate increases, such as SDG&E's, goes through the
PUC, which reviews such proposals and sets "reasonable" rates. But the law
signed in January that gave the DWR the power to buy electricity also gave the
agency the power to solely judge the merits of its own rate increase 
proposals.
