Hi Jeff,
Please give me a call at your earliest convenience.  I'd like to talk to you 
about what political/regulatory options may be available to Pilkington in 
California.  Thanks.

Steve

Hi Rick,
I read the article in the article in Enron Business that mentions your 
group's efforts in California.  I'd like to speak with you in order to find 
out if your efforts with the California government could possibly assist my 
client.  I am the EES Account Manager for Pilkington North America.  
Pilkington is a lage scale glass manufacturer with a plant in Lathrop, 
California.  They, like many other PG&E ratepayers, are going to be subjected 
to load curtailment this summer.  Being a large scale glass manufacturer who 
consumes a great deal of energy, they feel that being subjected to a 
curtailment would jeopardize the safety of the Lathrop community.  If the 
plant withstood a full scale meltdown in their furnace, caused by a 
curtailment, a plant of that size would require an enormous group of 
emergency service personnel.  Such a significant presence at the facility 
would jeopardize the safety of the rest of that small community.

Pilkington has already forwarded a letter to PG&E documenting this and it is 
currently under review.  I would like to know if you or a member of your 
group could pursue any political avenues with this letter.  Please call me at 
215-599-7047 at your earliest convenience.

Thank you,
Steve Beck
