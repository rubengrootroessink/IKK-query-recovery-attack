How about a Sunday night alumni/organizer dinner in Berkeley (I never did
get to eat at Chez Panisse - if it's still good, I'd love to go there). As I
think I mentioned earlier, I'm going to have to miss the Monday evening
dinner to fly to San Diego. I'm on a Tuesday morning NARUC Electricty Panel
speaking on RTOs.
