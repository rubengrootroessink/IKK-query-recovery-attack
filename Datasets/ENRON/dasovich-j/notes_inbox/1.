I have been told by the author's office that the Assembly is not going to 
bring
up the bill today.  Governor Davis is having a signing ceremony in Los Angeles
today for the new Caesar Chavez holiday so many of the latino members are out.
They need these members, baring a sudden change of heart by the Republican's,
in order to achieve a 2/3 vote.  However, the bill is still on file for
concurrence so we will monitor.  I'll let Sandi know.
