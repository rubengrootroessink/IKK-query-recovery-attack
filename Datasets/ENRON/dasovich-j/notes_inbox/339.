Bilbray's Power Fight
Emily Pierce, CQ Staff 
California's deregulated electricity> market has been a disaster for many 
consumers but may be a godsend for Republican Rep. Brian P. Bilbray.
The three-term lawmaker is tied in polls with Democratic state Assemblywoman 
Susan Davis, who has outpaced him in fundraising. In 1996, however, she voted 
for legislation that opened the state's <electricity> market to competition. 
The act was supposed to reduce prices and increase choice. Instead, the power 
bills of San Diego residents have doubled since last year.
Bilbray has seized on the resulting unrest, introducing legislation to let 
power companies buy some <electricity at cheaper rates. He will host a House 
Commerce Energy and Power Subcommittee field hearing on the issue Sept. 11 in 
San Diego.
Davis sponsored legislation in the state assembly to reinstate price caps in 
San Diego, retroactive to June 1. The bill was signed into law Sept. 6. 
Bilbray wrote state lawmakers Aug. 30 in support of the bill, "though it 
appears that this legislation was given to my opponent to help her in the 
November election."
Davis campaign manager Lisa Sherman said Bilbray is improperly using the 
issue, since he signed a 1996 letter supporting deregulation. But of the 
field hearing she said, "We wouldn't oppose getting national attention on 
this."
