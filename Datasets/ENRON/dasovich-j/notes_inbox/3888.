Robert:

To answer Jim's question - the savings to CDWR are monthly, is that correct?

As we discussed, I will check in with you around 1Central to see if you have 
the info. from Tamara.  Also, I left a message for Jeff asking about the gas 
infrastructure language.

Thanks, Jennifer

Robert --

Pls take a look.  We have some need for serious data inclusions and changes 
from Tamara.  I restructured the charts.  Hope this makes sense.

I also don't understand the Direct Access Benefits to CDWR table - Are the 
savings monthly, annually, total???

We need to add Jeff's section on Natural Gas.

Please everyone check out what I said about a California Demand Buy-Down 
system that should be in place until Retail Rate structure is changed.  Not 
sure if everyone wants this much detail or if this contradicts anything else 
we have put out.

The goal is to get this to Janel by 3pm Friday for her to include in a Draft 
Package for Steve over the weekend with final revisions on Monday.

I appreciate everyone's help.

Thanks,

Jim
