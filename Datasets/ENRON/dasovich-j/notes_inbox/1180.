Rep. Bilbray introduced HRes 650 yesterday afternoon, and it will be on the
floor under suspensions later today.  It simply expresses the Sense of
Congress that FERC should release it's completed report on the California
electricity market before Novemeber 1.

In discussions with FERC, we know the report is complete, but several dates
ranging from Nov. 1 to Nov. 9 have been given on the release of the report.
It is the opinion of Rep. Bilbray that the report should be made public
sooner, rather than later.  So many of the interested parties are in
limbo...waiting for the release of the report...that is just makes sense to
release it now, so everyone has the opportunity to examine, analyze, and
react to their findings.

As you read the resolution, you will see it's simple and to the point...we
don't pre-judge the report in any way.  Please let me know if you have any
questions or concerns.  Thank you!
