Dear TSC community,

I know what you=01,re wondering;  =01&When is everything going to turn arou=
nd?=018

Everyone is wearing that question on his or her face.  I call it
THE LOOK:  The look of disillusionment, of lethargy, of confusion.
Of when will =01+the good times=01, return?

And everywhere I am, whether on CNBC, at my desk, or on Wall Street,
I=01,m asked the same thing, =01&Cramer, when will the market turn around?=
=018

And I say, =01&That=01,s not the question you should be asking.  The
question to be asked is =01+How are YOU are going to make money in THIS mar=
ket?=018

Join me Monday evening, August 6 in New York City and I will show you
how to choose winning stocks, steer clear of the losers, and identify
the sectors that will side step the market=01,s volatility, and much more!
All to make you money!

Don't look for a magic bullet to solve everything.  It doesn't exist.
Take action.  I will show you how.

Register today! Save $100 by registering before July 23rd !

I=01,m looking forward to seeing you in August.
