Demand Side=01,s Promise
?
The coldest days of the year are when wholesale electricity prices are  amo=
ng=20
their highest, and when the risks of blackouts are greatest, least  welcome=
,=20
and even dangerous. On these days, frequently around the holidays, our =20
electric system and wallets are stressed to the limit. As energy demand=20
surges,  prices in the wholesale electric market skyrocket, with price caps=
=20
serving as  the only limits to the pricing power of wholesale suppliers. An=
d=20
as more  electricity is generated, old fossil fuel power plants emit more a=
nd=20
more  pollution into our environment.
?
At the other extreme, the hottest days of the year present the same =20
scenario, often with the added designation of being the smoggiest days. =20
Sometimes the smog =01* caused in part by the sun heating up pollutants emi=
tted =20
from power plants =01* is so bad that people are advised to stay indoors, a=
nd =20
thousands with respiratory illness crowd emergency rooms across the nation.=
 =20
?
Yet, we could all breathe easier, save money, and worry less about our  pow=
er=20
going out, if many more consumers were given the opportunity to change  the=
ir=20
electric usage in response to escalating prices, and to profit from doing =
=20
so. In electric restructuring vocabulary, =01&demand-side response=018 is=
=20
typically  used to describe these consumer actions to reduce or shift their=
=20
electric usage  in response to changes in prices.=20
?
For years, encouraging demand reduction or energy efficiency has been the =
=20
holy grail for the environmental community, because many of our country=01,=
s=20
most  pressing environmental and public health problems cannot be solved if=
=20
the nation  simply guzzles ever more dirty power. But these days, the case=
=20
for fostering  demand-side response has never been stronger, and there is a=
n=20
emerging consensus  that goes well beyond the environmental community about=
=20
the importance of  increasing demand-side response.=20
?
More and more experts now agree that empowering consumers to modify their =
=20
electricity usage in response to price will powerfully address the triple=
=20
threat  of pollution, high electric bills, and rolling blackouts, all of=20
which are now  plaguing California. Indeed, electric restructuring in=20
California or any other  state will not be complete until consumers are abl=
e=20
to modify their usage in  response to real-time prices.=20
?
But while greater demand-side response would deliver numerous benefits to =
=20
consumers, the economy, system reliability, and the environment, most=20
electric  markets presently provide far too few opportunities =01* even wit=
hin=20
Pennsylvania  and PJM, where retail and wholesale electricity competition=
=20
have been the most  successful.=20
?
Therefore, as the next crucial stage in its electricity restructuring, =20
Pennsylvania and PJM must now lead the way in creating policies and market =
=20
mechanisms to increase opportunities for demand-side response.=20
Encouragingly,  both the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC), wher=
e=20
Commissioner  Fitzpatrick sponsored a November 21st conference on the=20
subject, and PJM=01,s  management understand the stakes.
?
Demand-Side Benefits
A legitimate demand-side market  would serve as a check on high prices in t=
he=20
hourly and forward PJM energy  markets. PJM=01,s Market Monitoring Unit=20
calculates that a 1 percent reduction in  demand during peak periods (about=
=20
500 mW) can reduce market prices by about 10  percent. Empowering customers=
=20
to participate in the demand-side market limits  wholesale and retail price=
s,=20
impacting the forward market and making the retail  market more competitive=
.=20
?
In addition, a demand-side response reduction of 5,000 mW would enable PJM =
=20
to once again retain its one-day-in-ten reliability standard, an historic =
=20
reliability benchmark which has been put at risk due to the off-system sale=
s=20
of  generators this past summer.=20
?
The Technology
Three types of technologies are required  to achieve 5,000 mW of reliable=
=20
demand-side participation. Each is readily  available and, more importantly=
,=20
pays for itself. Yet not enough of these  technologies are being installed =
in=20
homes and businesses to safeguard the public  interest.
?
Remote appliance controls. These controls enable a consumer to  voluntarily=
=20
curtail his/her electric usage during peak periods in exchange for  an=20
economic benefit. For example, in its =01&On Call=018 program, FPL installs=
 an =20
energy management device in consumers=01, homes, connecting it to one or mo=
re =20
qualifying appliances. Through this program, FPL pays consumers up to $161=
=20
per  year in credits on their electric bills. More than 600,000 FPL custome=
rs=20
are  currently participating.=20
?
Here in PJM, BGE pays residential consumers $10 per summer month for =20
installing an =01&Energy Saver Switch=018 on their central air conditioners=
.=20
During  periods of high demand for electricity, BGE sends a radio signal=20
which activates  the switch, cycling the compressor in 15-minute increments=
.=20
More than 225,000  BGE residential customers currently use the Energy Saver=
=20
Switch and help BGE  manage summer peak load. Consumers who choose to=20
similarly cycle their electric  water heater receive an additional $5 credi=
t=20
per summer month.=20
?
Also in PJM, PEPCO=01,s 200 mW-sized =01&kilo-watchers plus=018 program off=
ers =20
participants about $100/year for the right to remotely cycle 100 hours of =
=20
residential air conditioning. In another example, The Allegheny Electric =
=20
Cooperative in Pennsylvania remotely switches air conditioners and water=20
heaters  from a central location in downtown Harrisburg.
?
For most consumers in these programs, it=01,s money in the bank without =20
noticeable impact. These programs demonstrate that many small consumers wan=
t=20
the  opportunity to voluntary save money in return for agreeing to brief =
=20
interruptions of selected appliances, and that it=01,s fairly simple to pro=
vide=20
the  technology and operate the program.
?
The Pennsylvania PUC and other state Commissions should encourage and, if =
=20
necessary, direct jurisdictional EDCs to offer remote appliance devices to =
=20
consumers. It=01,s not difficult to imagine that, if remote appliance devic=
es=20
were  implemented throughout PJM, 3,000 mW of small commercial and=20
residential  remotely cycled load could be bid in a demand-side market.=20
?
Metering Set-Top Devices or Advanced Metering. Advanced metering or  meteri=
ng=20
set-top devices register load decrements, enabling consumers and/or  their=
=20
suppliers to sell firm power into the peak market, instead of using it.  Fo=
r=20
example, a supplier (either the local utility or a competitive supplier) =
=20
could offer a lower price to a large consumer willing to reduce usage durin=
g =20
peak load, enabling the supplier to sell a relatively small amount of =20
electricity to those requiring firm service during the peak load. The=20
consumer  need not agree to limit usage except upon specific approval.=20
Already Duquesne  and soon PECO Energy will have deployed advanced metering=
=20
system-wide,  demonstrating that it can be economic even without the benefi=
ts=20
of demand-side  response.=20
?
There are also various devices or meter add-ons that modify existing meters=
 =20
and allow recording of load decrements (see, for example,=20
www.stonewatersoftware.com). These  devices or meter add-ons appear to pay=
=20
for themselves when the energy is sold  during periods when prices are abov=
e=20
the price the consumer is paying the EDC. =20
?
The need to ensure reliability in PJM, combined with the current =20
availability of technology to enable demand-side participation by all=20
consumers,  dictate that by 2004, all Pennsylvania customers should be=20
equipped with a  metering or appliance control device.
?
Internet-based Energy Management Platforms. Computer software is  necessary=
=20
to maximize the effectiveness of advanced metering. Programs have  already=
=20
been developed and used by major international corporations which enable =
=20
them to make precise decisions on when to sell power back into the market, =
=20
decrease usage, and use on-site generation. BGE, for one, recently announce=
d =20
deployment of the Omni-Link platform=20
(www.powerwebtechnologies.com/news/111200.htm). =20
?
Demand-Side Barriers
There are no inherent obstacles to  obtaining the benefits of demand-side=
=20
responses, but there are several important  commitments necessary to make t=
he=20
promise of demand-side market participation a  reality.=20
?
PJM and other ISOs, as well as utilities and suppliers, must all be able to=
 =20
offer demand-side platforms without discrimination. In addition, PJM and=20
other  ISOs have the direct responsibility to manage system reliability and=
=20
the  wholesale energy market. Demand-side responses directly impact=20
reliability and  wholesale market prices, including undesirable market powe=
r=20
during peak load.  There can be no doubt that ISOs have an inherent role,=
=20
indeed an inherent  responsibility, to maximize the effective deployment of=
=20
demand-side market  responses, especially to offer a platform for LSEs to=
=20
sell load decrements  created in response to price signals. PJM is on board=
,=20
but consumers who want to  sell directly into the PJM demand-side market fa=
ce=20
opposition from some  EDCs.
?
To unlock the potential of demand-side markets, the Pennsylvania PUC, other=
 =20
state commissions and the FERC must support the role of PJM and other ISOs=
=20
in  creating such a market. PJM must be permitted and encouraged to offer a=
 =20
demand-side platform. Finally, EDCs must be required to fully deploy=20
advanced  metering and remote appliance control programs.
?
These small but important public policies will help to protect the =20
reliability of our electricity system, our wallets, and our environment. =
