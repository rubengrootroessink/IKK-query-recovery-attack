>Hi folks, time is ticking away, and this Friday, September 15, is the
>deadline for turning in your submissions for the writing requirement.
>Because we're down to the wire, I'm providing more flexibility in the
>submission process.
>
>If you have already submitted one paper, you may submit your second one
>WITHOUT WAITING FOR MY FEEDBACK. As so many of you waited until the final
>moments to get your papers in, I am quite backed up and will not be able to
>return your papers until after the deadline.
>
>If you have already submitted both papers, thank you.
>
>If you have NOT submitted any work yet, you may submit BOTH papers AT THE
>SAME TIME.
>
>Check your mailbox regularly for returned papers. They will be marked
>either PASS or CONSULT.  If they are marked CONSULT, please contact me as
>soon as possible about setting up a time for us to meet.
>
>Let me know if you have any questions. You may contact me at: lutz@haas.

>Thanks!
