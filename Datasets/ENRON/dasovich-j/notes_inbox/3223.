FYI - This is a (draft) deliverable from the call on FERC and natural gas 
prices in CA last week (I believe you were part of this discussion for a 
while, and then needed to get off the call).   Jennifer

Thank you for your assistance.  This is very timely.  We are attending an 
INGAA meeting in the morning to discuss how best to argue against the Boucher 
Amendment that would overturn FERC's order that "deregulated" the secondary 
capacity market.  We also need talking points in our own right.  Will review 
and let you know if we have any questions.  The full committee mark up is now 
not likely until next Wednesday or Thursday.  Will keep you posted,
