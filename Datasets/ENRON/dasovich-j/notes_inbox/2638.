From one of the ARM members below. Our latest info is that there are still 3 
votes in SUPPORT of direct access. So, this measure would fail if that 
SUPPORT stays in place.  ARM and others plan a campaign to attack this draft 
decision.

From Commonwealth:
I have that Linda Serizawa, Commissioner Wood's advisor, has stated that
Commissioner Wood is at this moment drafting the decision on direct access.
She indicated that a draft order would be released, but would not say when.
She stated that ABX1-1 directed the CPUC to set a date at which time a
customer would no longer have the right to switch to an ESP, and indicated
that this order, as it is currently drafted, establishes that date.
Apparently there was great hesitant when making the statement "as it is
presently drafted," indicating to that Wood is getting a lot of pressure not
to set the date.
