My vote is for analyzing the Intel purchase because we have access to some
inside info, Anil is well versed in this industry (I assume) so we could do
some good comps analysis and it seems like the right size case for us.  We
could easily send Sarah the link Anil sent us and say that we are going to
analyze this acquisition.  I am also open to the Amazon analysis, although I
am not as excited about analyzing such a popular issue.

I was just brainstorming on potential projects.  I thought that an
interesting
and fairly relevant topic could be a current evaluation of Amazon.com and
how
the projected revenues & profits relate to the current stock price.  We
could
also provide some historical perspective on all realistic Amazon's stock
price
was a year or two ago relative to a discounted cash flow.  I can fairly
easily
get my hands on some Wall Street analyst research reports that could provide
us
with some insights and hints as to what Wall Street is expecting.  Most of
our
time can be spent creating a discounted cash flow model similar to what we
have
been doing in class.  Since the jury is still out on Amazon's business
model, I
think it would make for some interesting debate in class when we present our
model.
