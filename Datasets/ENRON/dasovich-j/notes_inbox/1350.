the PX is seeming to say that it will turn to the state to "save" it from FERC

CalPX's take on FERC's ability to end mandatory buy requirement.

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--The chief executive officer of the California Power 
Exchange responded Tuesday to details in a federal energy regulatory report 
that suggests the two-year-old exchange's mandatory buy requirement was 
partly to blame for this past summer's soaring wholesale electricity prices. 

     The details of the landmark probe prepared by the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission is scheduled to be released Wednesday morning, but some 
commissioners told Dow Jones Newswires the report will suggest that the 
state's mandatory buy rule should be abolished and utilities should be 
permitted to purchase their power through other power exchanges. 

     "We believe that the representation of the CalPX contributing to soaring 
wholesale prices is incorrect and misleading," said CalPX CEO George Sladoje. 

     "Over the summer months, certain wholesale market participants chose to 
not take full advantage of the price and cost mitigating products offered 
through the CalPX...if a participant chose to purchase all or most of their 
energy on the spot market, they often paid much more than other participants 
who chose to buy in the forwards market," Sladoje added. 

     It is widely known in the wholesale electricity market that Sempra 
Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric Co. purchased most of their power 
in the spot market, which the utility passed on to its customers at a much 
higher price. 

     SDG&E also complained to federal regulators that the CalPX hourly and 
day-ahead market clearing prices are too high. 

     When California moved to electricity deregulation four years ago, a 
statewide power exchange was created requiring Edison International (EIX) 
unit Southern California Edison, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric 
Co. and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. to purchase all of their power through 
the exchange until 2002, the expected transition date to a completely 
deregulated market. 

     But the FERC report proposes that utilities be permitted to purchase 
power from other exchanges in an effort to generate increased competition, 
commissioners said. 

     The CalPX purchases power one day in advance for California's three 
investor-owned utilities. Suppliers bid in power indicating their price. For 
each hour of the next day, the price of the last megawatt taken to meet 
demand sets the market price. 

     In various reports issued since 1996, FERC has commended the state's 
Power Exchange for running a successful market that helped mitigate concerns 
about market power abuses. 

     If the FERC report suggests that California end the mandatory buy 
requirement, it will be up to state lawmakers to see to draft Legislation to 
change the market rules, according to the CalPX.
