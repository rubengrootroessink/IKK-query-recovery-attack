PLEASE REVIEW IN PREPARATION FOR DISCUSSION THIS AFTERNOON.
_________________________________________________________________________

Here is a draft Real Time Pricing proposal for the consideration of the
Energy Committee, per our discussion at the last meeting.

The essence of the proposal is summarized in the first three pages; the
balance attempts to address some of the detailed concerns you have raised.

This proposal reflects the input of a group of EC members. Accordingly, it
deviates in important respects from Enron, CEC and Borenstein's submitted
testimony. It also incorporates concepts from the BAEF report and its
recommendations, and responds to objections to RTP raised by the CPUC as
reported by NRDC.


Regards,

Peter Evans
