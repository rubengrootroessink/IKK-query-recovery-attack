(I had type of bunch of this and them my computer died, so I have to rewrit=
e=20
it - UGH)
Harry's testimony was brilliant, and here is a summary. =20
Harry explained our proposal and how it achieves goals of equity and=20
conservation  (equity because all customers sacrifice equally and=20
conservation because there will be reductions in usage).  The other proposa=
ls=20
in the case arbitrarily allocate costs to peak, whereas our proposal will=
=20
have customers reacting to price signals, and if affords flexibility.  The=
=20
Hearing Examiner (HE) asked what services EES provides, and whether our=20
customers were DA customers (she was trying to get to our real interest in=
=20
this case, which the PG&E attorney helped with later).

Slocum (PG&E) did not understand that our proposal was only for TOU=20
customerrs and asked a lot of questions about implementation problems that=
=20
were based on implementation for all classes.(Questions like moving usage=
=20
data to billing system, 30% turnover in customers, lack of data for new=20
customers, lack of metering).  Harry acknowledged that the peak defined by =
DJ=20
might not match the rate class peak definition and that some adjustments=20
might have to be made.  Slocum noted that TOU meters do not show hourly=20
usage, and that hourly interval meters would need to be installed to make o=
ur=20
proposal work.  Harry answered that we recognize that our proposal would ta=
ke=20
time, but that we need to move to this and that customers need price signal=
s=20
this summer. =20

Our proposal is only for TOU customers, and for those for whom it cannot be=
=20
implemented, an equal 3 cents per kwh is appropriate.  Harry noted that we=
=20
have not taken a position on the proposal that should be adopted for other=
=20
customer classes yet. =20

He was asked where the 87% came from, ands he pointed out the derivation th=
at=20
was in his testimony based on predicted market price and cost of retained=
=20
generation.  Two assumptions were made:  a $300 average market price and=20
customers have same billing determinants for 2001 in combination with marke=
t=20
price assumptions and existing generation rate to get the revenue=20
requirements.  It is possible that the price may not be $300 and our revenu=
e=20
requirements may be off, but this is true with every other proposal  as=20
well.  The basis for the $300 is the COB and PV Nymex contracts. =20

If our proposal cannot be implemented this summer, the 3 cent charge sends =
an=20
adequate and strong signal to consumers across the board.  When asked wheth=
er=20
PG&E would have to program a different method for TOU customers if Enron=01=
,s=20
proposal is adopted, Harry answered that they already have to program a=20
different method for TOU customers under existing rates.  PG&E asked how th=
e=20
decremental reward program would be funded.  Harry noted that it could be=
=20
funded through the ISO, DWR, utility bonding.  The PG&E attorney noted that=
=20
the utilities have been downgraded to junk bond status and couldn=01,t issu=
e=20
bonds.  Funding is an issue.

Then PG&E asked if we left the market on 2/1/01.  Harry answered no.  We=20
simply began sourcing power from the utility, but our contracts are still i=
n=20
effect.  She asked Harry what kind of customers we had, were they mostly=20
large TOU customers?  Do they have interval meters?  She asked if we were o=
n=20
the hook for the difference between the bundled rate and the contract rate.=
 =20
Harry answered that he didn=01,t know on balance what impact our proposal w=
ould=20
have on our TOU customers.   Our proposal helps to foster the goals and=20
pursue the incentives to get to the needed solutions in CA.  He also noted=
=20
that all parties to this proceeding were proposing methodologies that were=
=20
most beneficial to them.

SC&E asked a bunch of questions about recovery of T&D costs, if the 87%=20
target were used.  Harry answered that any undercollections that may result=
=20
(and this could be true under any of the proposals) could be dealt with it =
a=20
rate case filing.  They also talked about how the customer would know the=
=20
daily prices, would the utility be obligated to make that info available?  =
HK=20
answered that it is forecast a day ahead and is publicly available.  Then h=
e=20
was asked whether Enron would fund the decremental reward program.  Harry=
=20
noted that we might under the right conditions, but this was outside his=20
expertise.

ORA asked about weather normalization, again under the misapprehension that=
=20
our proposal applied to weather sensitive smaller customers.  Harry also to=
ld=20
him that the indices we proposed were very liquid.  He also handled questio=
ns=20
on whether a different average price would yield a different break point, a=
nd=20
we need to provide calculations that show an average price of $200 and $500=
. =20

The Hearing Examiner then asked for Enron=01,s estimates of summer on peak =
and=20
off peak prices, and ruled that we must supply that info by COB Monday, ove=
r=20
counsel=01,s objections.

In general, I think there was a lot of confusion about our proposal (not=20
understanding that it was only directed to one type of customer).  There is=
=20
also a lot of distrust of Enron and I would add dislike as well.  I do not=
=20
think the HE will consider any of our proposals seriously and in fact our=
=20
support on some of the other proposals could be the kiss of death.  I would=
=20
keep our brief very short and very limited,  as we can weigh in on support =
of=20
the other A and RD methodologies after the HE issues her recommended=20
decision.  In fact, we might even like a proposal she recommends.
