Jeffrey:
Will you be able to join other VentureWire
subscribers in the Bay area for this month's breakfast
briefing?  We'll be gathering at the San Mateo Marriott
next Tuesday (7/24) to hear Bryant Tong's thoughts on
this month's topic:

The Energy Sector: Urgent Needs, Emerging Opportunities.

It's becoming clear that far-reaching changes in energy
markets, along with urgent production and distribution
needs across the country, have created a wealth of new
opportunities for high-tech investment -- at a time
when deal flow in other sectors has significantly
diminished.

Join us for a presentation by Bryant J. Tong, managing
director of Nth Power Technologies, on the important
trends, key strategies, emerging opportunities, and
potential risks involved in investing in this growing
sector. Nth Power Technologies is a venture capital
firm focused on investment opportunities arising from
the restructuring of the global energy utility
marketplace.

For VentureWire subscribers, we have extended the early
registration discount through this Friday, July 20.
Pay only $99 for the July 24th VentureWire Breakfast:
The Energy Sector: Urgent Needs, Emerging Opportunities.
So register online at http://events.venturewire.com
prior to July 20 and pay only $99.

Hope you'll be able to join us on July 24.

Best,
Brian O'Connell
