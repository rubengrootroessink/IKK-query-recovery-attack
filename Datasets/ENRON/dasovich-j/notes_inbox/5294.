Jeff, Mark:

Wondering where you were yesterday. Hope you didn't
forget about the in-class quiz!

The next HW and writeup due next week seems like
a heavy one.
Do most of you have Monday off? I'll take a look at the
case/HW Sa/Su, and prefer a meeting / conf call anytime
Monday. Perhaps PM in the city if folks are working
that day? Sunday PM (after 7) works for me too.

-Anil
