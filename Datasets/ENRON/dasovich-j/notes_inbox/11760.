Rumor is that the CPUC hearings will begin next week on the URG matters for 
PG&E and SCE.  Our bankruptcy team needs to be kept in the loop on these 
matters on a daily basis (as much as possible) given the impact of this 
decision on the process.

Can people attend a conference call on Monday pm or Tuesday am to discuss the 
key objectives for this case (from bankruptcy perspectives) and coverage (do 
we need to get outside counsel to sit in the hearings)?

I'll ask Linda Noske to coordinate the phone call.

Thanks,

Jim
