So far no one has declined, and everyone is interested.  Lynch is in,
Littlechild is interested, Harris is interested. Allen, could you work on
Hoecker and Markey?  I'll see what I can find out about Markey and Barton.

Lee is making progress on a few more fundraising avenues so GSPP will handle
that.

We'll need to figure out our next tier of speakers soon.  I want to make sure
that all of you have all the information you want but I'm getting the sense 
that
conference calls are too time-consuming.   What if I give a weekly update and
you can all respond to the group if you choose? I think our last call
established a vision of the conference and the rest is day-to-day management 
for
which we don't need a committee meeting.  I would suggest one modification of
the vision, though.  We need a little better balance of policy perspectives to
make sure we get the real decision-makers.  To modify the GSPP motto, we can
speak truth with power better if we add a couple big players like Rep. Barton
who is an important figure with conservative views.  I think the conference
would be more interesting, attract more of an audience and more sponsorship, 
and
make more progress.  Comments?  I may be out of town the next couple days so 
you
won't hear from me.
