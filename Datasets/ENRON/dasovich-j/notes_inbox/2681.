Bingaman, Senate Energy Chief, Will Block Bush Plan (Update1)

Bingaman, Senate Energy Chief, Will Block Bush Plan (Update1)

     (Adds company names in fourth paragraph and details about
contributions in paragraph 23.)

     Washington, June 5 (Bloomberg) -- President George W. Bush
delivered his energy plan to Senator Frank Murkowski last month,
expecting the Alaska Republican to push it more or less intact
through the Senate and on to passage by the House.
     Now the package intended to boost oil and gas production and
ease some pollution controls is in the hands of Jeff Bingaman. The
New Mexico Democrat disagrees with Bush's approach and wants to
start fresh negotiations on what U.S. policy should be.
     Bingaman, 57, who's spent most of his 19 years in the Senate
out of the spotlight, will become chairman of the Energy and
Natural Resources Committee when Democrats take control of the
Senate later this week.
     Bush wants to make it easier for companies like Enron Corp.,
Exxon Mobil Corp. and BP Plc, to build power plants and pipelines
by easing regulations, and he's opposed to regulating the carbon
dioxide emissions blamed for global warming. Bingaman has
introduced legislation to cut emissions to curb global warming.
     The president's proposal to drill in the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge, in trouble even with Republicans in charge, is
dead as long as Democrats have control. Bingaman has no plans to
consider it.
     Bush opposes caps on energy prices; Bingaman is cosponsor of
legislation to impose caps on wholesale energy prices in
California although, according to a spokesman, he'd prefer the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission do that on its own.

                         Seeking Consensus

     Bingaman says rather than offer his own plan now, he'll try
to sit down with Republicans and negotiate something both sides
can agree on. There is already agreement on some proposals, such
offering tax credits to encourage domestic drilling and the use by
business of renewable energy technology, such as wind-powered
turbines.
     ``Obviously, I'm going to work for consensus,'' he said.
``There's nothing about much of these issues that should be
partisan.''
     Bingaman says he hasn't decided whether to push a single,
comprehensive energy bill or move issues separately. Democrats may
insist on separate bills for political purposes, said Tim Evans, a
senior energy analyst at IFR Pegasus.
     ``They'll say, `Let's get all of the most vulnerable
Republicans on record supporting drilling and see if they get re-
elected,''' he said.
     Whatever his decision, Bingaman won't meet Murkowski's goal
to have a bill for Bush to sign on July 4.
     ``I'm not anxious to have some artificial deadline so that we
can have a bill-signing ceremony on a holiday,'' Bingaman said.
``I don't think that's the way to legislate.''

                     Visionary or Do-Nothing?

     Throughout his career, Bingaman has made a practice of taking
time to study an issue before acting.
     ``He's something of a visionary,'' said Bruce Black, a former
law partner who became a federal judge in New Mexico after
Bingaman recommended his nomination. ``He sees trends.''
     Opponents see inaction.
     ``He doesn't accumulate much in the way of negatives by not
doing much,'' said John Dendahl, chairman of the Republican Party
of New Mexico.
     Bingaman is a politician who doesn't stray from party
positions, Dendahl said. ``He's not a maverick. He's always been
when the chips are down a straight Democratic voter.'' In 2000,
Bingaman voted with the party leadership 87 percent of the time on
votes in which the two parties took opposing positions, according
to data compiled by Congressional Quarterly.

                        Fundraising Success

     In the Senate, Bingaman's strategy has been to home in on
issues that have been neglected, such as school accountability and
defense research that has civilian uses, work with others, and not
hog the credit.
     ``He wouldn't try to beat it to the front of the class,''
said Ben Alexander, a Bingaman fundraiser.
     That approach appears to have worked: Republicans haven't
been able to budge Bingaman from his Senate seat by appealing to
New Mexicans' distrust of party-line politicians.
     With Alexander's help, Bingaman built a campaign fund that's
helped him fend off rivals. He raised $2.7 million for his 2000 re-
election bid compared with his Republican challenger's $669,000.
     The $295,527 Bingaman got from oil and gas companies and
electric utilities made him the industry's sixth-largest
congressional recipient in last year's elections, according to the
Center for Responsive Politics.
     The oil and gas industry gave $32.6 million overall last year
in campaign contributions. The top contributor, Enron, a pipeline
and energy-trading firm, gave $2.4 million. Exxon, the world's
largest publicly traded oil company, followed with $1.4 million
and BP, the third largest publicly traded oil company, donated
$1.3 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.

                     Comparison With Murkowski

     Environmentalists said Bingaman will balance conservation and
production concerns better than Murkowski.
     ``Murkowski wants to jam through an agenda'' to boost
production, said Alyssondra Campaigne, legislative director of the
National Resources Defense Council. Bingaman ``tends to be more
studious and thorough.''
     As chairman, Murkowski has pushed a comprehensive bill that
includes tax incentives to promote the use of alternative energy
and opening 1.5 million acres of the 19-million acres of the
Alaska refuge to oil and gas exploration.
     Bingaman has proposed leasing land in the Gulf of Mexico for
oil production, and that concerns environmentalists.
     ``It would put too much at risk in coastal resources,'' the
NRDC's Campaigne said.



USA: TECO breaks ground on 599-MW Arkansas power plant.

(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, June 5 (Reuters) - TECO Energy subsidiary TECO Power Services held 
a groundbreaking ceremony Tuesday on its 599-megawatt natural gas-fired power 
plant in Dell, Ark. 
Actual construction on the Dell Power Station began in March, the company 
said in a statement.
One megawatt provides enough electricity for about 1,000 average homes, 
therefore the Dell plant will provide enough electricity for about 600,000 
homes. 
National Energy Production Corp. (NEPCO), a subsidiary of Houston-based 
energy giant Enron Corp. , is building the plant. 
The Dell plant, along with a sister plant, the McAdams station in Kosciusko, 
Miss., are designed to interconnect with the Entergy transmission system. 
Both will sell electricity to wholesale customers in the Southeast and 
Midwest, TECO said. 
Dell is expected to begin commercial operation in the second half of 2002. 
Tampa, Fla.-based TECO Energy units include Tampa Electric, Peoples Gas 
System, TECO Transport, TECO Coal, TECO Coalbed Methane, TECO Propane 
Ventures and TECO Solutions. TECO Power Services have announced projects to 
serve customers in 18 states, spanning the southern half of the U.S. 
TECO Energy has ownership in nearly 11,000 megawatts, operating, under 
construction or in advanced stages of development worldwide.

UK: Intl bonds-Telecoms suffer despite positive market.

06/05/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, June 5 (Reuters) - European telecoms firms were hit by rumours of new 
issuance and profit taking in the international bond markets on Tuesday while 
other industries enjoyed stable prices on good market sentiment. 
The Reuters CorpTop index and traders had telecoms spreads - the difference 
between the yield on corporate and similarly dated government bonds - between 
two and four basis points wider on Tuesday.
Industrial companies and utilities, however, traded two to three basis points 
tighter. 
The fall in telecoms bonds prices was partly caused by strong indications 
from investment banks that Deutsche Telekom is on the verge of launching a 
deal for between five and 10 billion euros. 
"That rumour has caused some repricing today bu we also have profit taking 
after a month-long rally in telecoms prices caused patly by a fall in equity 
volatility and partly by a feeling that the harsh part of the storm may have 
passed," said one London-based trader. 
Telecoms bonds have benefitted from a feeling among many investors that the 
immediate danger of credit rating downgrades and further bad news has now 
passed. 
"Telecoms is a roller coaster but maybe the twists and turns are a little 
more gentle than they were four months ago," said one Paris-based trader. 
"Also remember that many of these companies are household names and that 
attracts the retail market while the possibility of getting a heavier coupon 
on further downgrades attracts those out looking for risk," she added. 
A good run, however, has triggered some selling as investors look to cash in. 
British Telecom's 6.125 percent, February 2006 bond, for example, was trading 
two basis points wider on the day, traders said. 
Meanwhile, Deutsche Telekom's 6.125 percent July 2005 issue was trading out 
seven basis points by 1400 GMT. 
Investment banks have been in talks with the German telecom giant for several 
months regarding a jumbo bond issue, but Deutsche Telekom's need to make 
coupon repayments on outstanding bonds in June and July mean an announcement 
is expected soon. 
Bankers said they expected the bond to be entirely denominated in euros as 
this is where the operator can achieve the best cost of funding. 
Deutsche Telekom issued a $14.6 billion transaction last year which was the 
largest corporate bond sale ever at the time. 
Moody's put Deutsche Telekom's A2 long-term rating on review for a possible 
downgrade in March while S&P placed its A-rating on review for a downgrade in 
February. 
In the primary market insurance firm Swiss Life launched a 300 million euro, 
0.50 percent exchangeable bond which can be switched for shares of HSBC 
Holdings or Swiss Life itself. 
An official from lead manager Lehman Brothers said that the bond was three 
times oversubscribed and that a 50 million euro greenshoe - extra bonds held 
by the underwriter and released if there is sufficient demand - was also 
sold. 
The bond was entirely sold to European investors and all buyers where from 
major financial institutions, the official said. 
Elsewhere in the primary market the European bank for Reconstruction and 
Development launched a one billion euro five-year deal. It priced at 52 basis 
points over the 4.625 percent May 2006 U.S. Treasury. 
Meanwhile, Energy giant Enron sold 10 billion yen due 2004. 
British supermarket chain Sainsbury announced that it plans to launch a 
benchmark euro bond in the near future. Deutsche Bank and HSBC will lead the 
transaction.

Natural gas generators considered to ease electricity demand, prices

06/05/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

EUGENE, Ore. (AP) - Natural gas generators could ease demand and prices for 
electricity in the southern Willamette Valley, where businesses and utilities 
are bracing for skyrocketing rates and power shortages. 
The biggest proposal is a 500-megawatt power plant that Texas energy giant 
Enron Corp. may build on industrial property in the Coburg area, possibly on 
the site where Willamette Industries runs a wood products plant.
By comparison, Eugene and neighboring Springfield use a total of about 450 
megawatts. 
The rest of the proposals are for smaller operations that mostly would be 
connected to local businesses and mills. 
"Everyone's looking for power," says Frank Lambe, general manager of the 
Emerald People's Utility District. 
Even if the Enron plant is built within Emerald's service territory, it 
doesn't mean the local utility would get any of the power. 
Enron, with revenues of more than $100 billion, typically sells power to the 
highest bidder. 
In fact, an Enron plant likely would require Emerald to buy another 10 
megawatts of electricity on the open market to run the plant's lights, 
heating and other needs. 
Emerald board member Katherine Schacht, who represents the Coburg area, said 
she's concerned that the power from the Enron plant would go to California 
rather than helping meet local energy needs. 
She also said "there are a lot of questions that need to be asked and 
answered" about the plant's impact on water, air quality and other issues. 
The Enron plant would be similar to those now under construction in the 
Hermiston area and in Klamath Falls. Those plants are several stories high, 
emit large amounts of carbon dioxide and consume between 2,000 and 2,400 
gallons of water a minute. 
Carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, isn't a regulated pollutant. 
Enron and the businesses considering their own generators would buy natural 
gas from the main north-south pipeline that runs down the Willamette Valley. 
The plans are only preliminary, but they illustrate growing concern about 
future price increases that could reach 100 percent this fall and worries 
that the region will suffer energy shortages for the next several years. 
Many businesses also see a chance to make money by generating electricity in 
a market with wholesale prices that have jumped over $300 a megawatt - 10 
times the going rate a year ago. 
Enron hasn't applied for any permits for a plant in the Eugene area, nor has 
the company given the state an official notice that it intends to build the 
plant. 
But Enron has notified the Bonneville Power Administration, the federal power 
marketing agency in Portland that supplies the Northwest with half its 
electricity, that it is considering building the plant. 
If Enron does build a plant in the Eugene area, it would need a permit from 
the Lane Regional Air Pollution Authority to emit nitrogen oxides and any 
other contaminants. 
A large plant also would need approval from the Oregon Energy Facilities 
Siting Council, as well as local jurisdictions if it requires land use 
changes.

Waste Management to Start Trading Pulp and Paper (Update1)

     (Adds closing share price.)

     Houston, June 5 (Bloomberg) -- Waste Management Inc., North
America's largest trash hauler, formed a pulp- and paper-trading
group to help control the risk of price swings from its recycling
business.
     The largest recycling company, Houston-based Waste Management
expects trading to begin in the third quarter, the company said in
a Business Wire release. It runs 190 facilities for collecting
such items as paper, plastic, glass and aluminum.
     Trading will begin gradually as the company emphasizes
management of the 4 million tons of paper it handles annually,
President A. Maurice Myers said in the statement.
     Other companies also have begun trading in pulp and paper
items such as old newspapers and corrugated containers. Enron
Corp., an energy-trading and pipeline company, is applying its gas-
and power-trading models to paper. It owns a newsprint mill in
Garfield, New Jersey, and another in Canada.
     Waste Management shares rose 56 cents to $28.40. The company
had sales of $12.5 billion last year.


Profile: Power Play, Who's to Blame for the Energy Crisis?; Lowell Bergman,

discuss the energy crisis

ABC News: Nightline

Announcer: June 4th, 2001. CHRIS BURY host: 
Rolling power blackouts, bankrupt utilities, skyrocketing electricity prices.
Unidentified Man #1: It is the most volatile commodity in the world. 
BURY: Are power generators gouging consumers? 
Unidentified Woman #1: I think it's pretty appalling that the folks who sell 
us power can charge whatever they want. 
Mr. KENNETH L. LAY (Chairman, Enron): And every time there's a shortage or a 
little bit of a price spike, it is always collusion or conspiracy or 
something. I mean, it always makes people feel better that way. 
BURY: And right in the middle, a federal agency you've probably never heard 
of. 
Mr. CURTIS HEBERT (Chairman, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission): They 
didn't build this monopolistic system overnight, and we won't change it 
overnight either. 
BURY: Tonight, Power Play, Who's to Blame for the Energy Crisis? 
Announcer: From ABC News, this is NIGHTLINE. Substituting for Ted Koppel and 
reporting from Washington, Chris Bury. 
BURY: California is known as the great American incubator. From hem lines to 
Hula-Hoops, the Golden State gives birth to trends that often spread east. 
That is why so many states are paying close attention to California's 
troubled attempt at deregulating electricity. Last week, California Governor 
Gray Davis asked President Bush for help in the form of a price cap on power 
companies. The president said no. Now Governor Davis is threatening to sue 
the federal agency that regulates electricity prices. More on that later. 
But first, the results of a new ABC News/Washington Post poll. It suggests 
that President Bush is developing an energy problem. When asked what they 
think of the president's performance on energy, a clear majority, 58 percent, 
say they disapprove. That's up 15 percent since Mr. Bush released his energy 
plan. When asked if they think the United States is heading into an energy 
crisis, six in 10 Americans answer yes. 
TEXT: 
ABC News POLL The Washington Post 
Margin of Error +-3.0% 
How do you rate the president's performance on energy? 
June 3 May 13 
Disapprove 58% 43% 
Do you think the US is heading into an energy crisis? 
Yes 61% No 36% 
BURY: California is already there. For months now, The New York Times and the 
public broadcasting program "Frontline" have teamed up to investigate. Their 
collaboration, "Blackout," airs tomorrow night on many PBS stations. It 
documents a colossal mismatch in the brand new game of buying and selling 
power on the open market. It's like the New York Yankees against the Toledo 
Mud Hens. 
Unidentified Woman #2: We didn't use his five because their minimum was, you 
know, higher than what we were willing to pay. 
Unidentified Man #2: I'll sell you 108 now. 
BURY: (VO) On one side, companies such as Enron, the Texas energy broker, 
trade electricity like any other commodity. A sophisticated trading operation 
buys and sells billions of dollars worth of energy every day. It's the 
largest company of its kind in the world. 
Unidentified Man #3: See what I'm saying? 
KELLY: CRS. This is Kelly. 
BURY: (VO) On the other side, in this converted department store in 
Sacramento, is California's trading team. 
Unidentified Man #4: This is the operations center. This is the--this is the 
location where we make energy purchases and fill the state of California 
energy requirements. 
BURY: (VO) Here, employees drafted from the state's water department go 
head-to-head with the pros from Enron and other companies. Since 1999, the 
cost to California has skyrocketed from $7 billion to an estimated $60 
billion this year, an increase of 750 percent. And the demand for 
electricity, up less than 5 percent. 
(OC) In their documentary, reporters for The New York Times and "Frontline" 
address a fundamental question, who's to blame? Narrating this segment is 
"Frontline" correspondent Lowell Bergman. 
Unidentified Man #5: Our forecast reserves look like they'd be pretty thin 
over the peak as well. 
Unidentified Man #6: How much is... 
LOWELL BERGMAN reporting: 
(VO) The power industry blames the high prices on shortages brought on by 
California's failure to build any major power plants over the last decade, 
despite a booming economy. 
Mr. LAY: I mean, we have a supply/demand imbalance. Too much demand, too 
little supply in California. 
BERGMAN: (VO) Not everyone agrees. Consumer advocates in California accuse 
the generators of actually withholding supply. 
Ms. NETTIE HOGE (Executive Director, TURN): The idea that all of a sudden we 
had a supply crunch is preposterous. What happened is, all of a sudden, the 
new plant owners and the traders, like Mr. Lay's organization, looked at the 
data and figured out how to manipulate the market. As soon as that happened, 
the prices never went down again. If it was totally a supply problem, why 
would we have excess prices at 5:00 in the morning on Christmas Day when 
nobody but Santa is working? 
BERGMAN: (VO) The generators, in turn, say they shut down plants for routine 
winter maintenance. 
Mr. LAY: Every time there's a shortage or a little bit of a price spike, it's 
always collusion or conspiracy or something. I mean, it always makes people 
feel better that way. 
BERGMAN: But you know as well as I do that the price--it's nice for a 
business. 
Mr. LAY: Yeah. 
BERGMAN: You're in the business of--of making money for your shareholders. 
Mr. LAY: Mm-hmm. 
BERGMAN: Right, as a company? 
Mr. LAY: Yeah. 
BERGMAN: So you would be foolish, as you said, to turn down the kind of money 
you could make this past winter in California. Is--isn't there a... 
Mr. LAY: I--I--I think you put words in my mouth out there. 
BERGMAN: OK. 
Mr. LAY: I said we--we made some money in California. We made some money 
across the country and around the world. I mean, and as I tell my friends in 
California, Enron was doing quite well before California imploded. 
Unidentified Man #7: So you can't blame the Enrons. I mean, they're the 
guys--that's--that's what they do. They try to make as much money from the 
money that they get invested. You blame the regulators. 
BERGMAN: (VO) Across the country, tucked in an out of the way building behind 
Union Station in Washington, DC, sits the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission or FERC. FERC's commissioners are appointed by the president and 
control a $250 billion energy sector critical to America's economy. With the 
coming of deregulation, state control over wholesale electricity rates passed 
to the federal government, making FERC the final arbiter of just and 
reasonable rates. It's a power FERC has been reluctant to use. 
Curt Hebert is a protege of Senator Trent Lott, who convinced President 
Clinton to appoint Hebert to the FERC in 1997. In January, President Bush 
made him the FERC chairman, and Hebert has made no bones about where he 
stands on free markets. 
Mr. HEBERT: The rules of competition govern that economies work, that choice 
works. It's why we're American. We inherently like choice. It's why we left 
the mother country. We didn't like the rules they were setting. We wanted to 
make our own rules. We want our own choices and we believe that works. 
BERGMAN: OK, but is electricity different? 
Mr. HEBERT: It's a transition . It takes some time. Look, they didn't build 
this monopolistic system overnight, and we won't change it overnight either. 
Mr. WILLIAM MASSEY (FERC Commissioner): Without some effective price control 
this summer, I fear for the worst. 
BERGMAN: (VO) William Massey is a FERC commissioner, a Democrat, who has 
found himself in opposition to his chairman. 
Unidentified Man #8: Mr. Massey, what is the nub of the disagreement that you 
have with Mr. Hebert? 
Mr. MASSEY: I think what it boils down to is a philosophical disagreement 
about the role of my agency in ensuring just and reasonable prices. 
I think it's long past time for this agency to step in and--and impose a 
temporary time out on the markets. 
Mr. HEBERT: Well, that is the problem because these people are saying 
temporary, but they don't mean temporary. It's kind of like the temporary 
rent control you have in New York. It's not temporary at all. Matter of fact, 
you know, in Washington, DC, we don't do temporary very well, and that's a 
problem. 
BERGMAN: (VO) In fact, late last year, after six months of unrelenting high 
prices in California, the FERC finally did declare California's rates unjust 
and unreasonable, but took no action. 
Governor GRAY DAVIS (Governor, California): So they found these people guilty 
a year ago. They just haven't agreed on the sentence. 
BERGMAN: Well, we talked with Curt Hebert. And we got... 
Gov. DAVIS: Well that's, you know. 
BERGMAN: That's what? 
Gov. DAVIS: Lots of luck. 
BERGMAN: What do you mean, "Lot's of luck"? 
Gov. DAVIS: Because... 
BERGMAN: He's the federal--he's the guy you are turning to to give you the 
money. 
Gov. DAVIS: He is the chairman of the commission. But he has not been overly 
sympathetic to California. He's more of an ideologue than a problem solver. 
BERGMAN: Well, he's saying you just want him to give you short-term relief, 
price caps, which won't solve the problem. 
Gov. DAVIS: Problems meaning fattening the balance sheet of already 
enormously wealthy energy companies. 
BURY: How much blame do the energy companies really deserve? 
BERGMAN: Watch your--your heating bills, your natural gas bills, which are, 
to a certain extent, reflected in your electricity bill. And don't think that 
this couldn't happen where you are. 
BURY: And how much of this energy crisis did California bring upon itself? 
Those questions when we come back. 
Announcer: This is ABC News: NIGHTLINE, brought to you by... 
(Commercial break) 
BURY: Joining us from Boston, Lowell Bergman, the correspondent for 
tomorrow's "Frontline" broadcast. From our Los Angeles bureau, Laura Holson, 
a business correspondent for The New York Times, who's been covering the 
California energy crisis. And here in Washington, Joe Kahn, who reports on 
energy and economics for The New York Times. 
Laura, just before the break, we heard California Governor Davis blaming the 
energy companies and the federal regulators. How much of his argument is 
sinking in. In other words, whom do Californians blame for this? 
Ms. LAURA HOLSON (The New York Times): The interesting thing is Californians 
blame everybody for this ap--for what has happened with the energy crisis. 
They blame the governor for not responding quickly enough to a crisis that 
started, you know, a year ago, if you really, you know, look at when prices 
starting going up. They are angry at their utilities who they feel have 
failed them. They have often had very close kind of paternal relationships 
with their utilities and they feel that they've been cheated. And they are 
very angry with the power generators, in particular, who they feel are 
charging them just exorbitant amounts for energy. 
In particular, there was a company last week, a power generator that said it 
charged consumers, rather the utilities, 4,000, nearly $4,000 per megawatt 
hour, which is enough to light a thousand homes for one hour. And when they 
heard this, they were outraged. They just thought, you know, `How can this 
be? How can we get,' in their terms, kind of ripped off by power generators 
who are using them to make, you know, a lot of money. 
BURY: Joe Kahn we heard those poll numbers from this survey out tonight 
suggesting that President Bush has a bit of a public relations problem on 
energy. How is that going to affect the politics here in Washington? 
Mr. JOSEPH KAHN (The New York Times): Well, clearly the--President Bush and 
the White House are calculating that by the time people have to go to the 
polls to select a new president, a slew of new power plants will be online in 
California. Electricity prices, presumably, will come down quite a bit and 
their free market stance on this will not ultimately cost him at the polls. 
It's not as clear that Republicans in the Congress have the same commitment. 
This has already been a very turbulent time in Washington with the Democrats 
now in control of the Senate. I think you can expect to see a legislative 
initiative by the Democrats to introduce some kind of price caps in 
California. Some Republicans may sign on to that. Some have already indicated 
that they will. It's going to be a real knockdown political flight--fight in 
Washington over what the strategy ought to be. 
BURY: Lowell Bergman, talk a little bit about that free market activity that 
Joe just mentioned. We saw the clip from your documentary with the--the 
traders from Enron pitted against the--the buyers from California. And I must 
say, it really did look like a mismatch. 
BERGMAN: Well, in fact, some of the people at Enron told us that they welcome 
the day when PG&E and Southern California Edison, the regular utilities get 
back in the marketplace because they do feel like they've got them, if you 
will, outgunned. And--but I should point out to the audience, that when Laura 
was talking about this $3800 a megawatt hour, which was Duke Energy Company, 
the normal price, if you will, the standard price for a megawatt hour was 
around 40 or less. So the level of profit that we're talking about is what 
people are upset about. And the problem here is--is primarily that in a free 
market and the way that the marketplace in California is set up in 
particular, there's no limit to what could be--could be charged when you get 
close to that area of scarcity with electricity. Electricity truly is 
different and as Jeff Skillings says in our documentary, he's the CEO of 
Enron, it is the most volatile commodity in the world. 
BURY: Yet, at the same time, Joe, we are seeing electricity traded as if it 
were oil or soybeans or steel. I mean, how is electricity different? 
Mr. KAHN: Well, for economic reasons, it's different in a--in a couple of key 
respects. For one thing, it's an absolutely vital commodity. People aren't 
prepared to do without it. Moreover, electricity powers every other part of 
the economy. So, it's one of these sort of fundamental rights that we have. 
In fact, as far back as the New Deal, Franklin Roosevelt made clear that 
electricity was so important that it would be subject to federal legislation 
guaranteeing everybody in this country just and reasonable electricity 
prices. 
BURY: But just and reasonable electricity prices, Laura, do you want to pick 
up the question of well, who determines what's just and reasonable here? 
Ms. HOLSON: Well, it's very clear that President Bush believes that the 
market, you know, sets what's just and reasonable. And, you know, that has 
not been what Governor Davis has said at all. He believes that because this 
is a commodity that people, you know, believe is guaranteed that there should 
be some price cap on it. It's an interesting, if you will, situation when 
business and politics kind of intersect. Governor Davis said very early on 
that he did not want two things to happen in California. One is that the 
utilities would go bankrupt and the second was that rates would be raised for 
consumers. And he's in a very tight spot right now because those two things 
that he did not want to happen indeed have happened. And it only looks like 
it will get worse this summer when experts have said Californians can expect 
another 260 hours of blackouts. 
BURY: Laura, we have to take a break. But when we come back, we want to 
address the question of whether power companies are doing what just comes 
naturally to them. Back with our guests in a moment. 
(Commercial break) 
BURY: We're back with "Frontline"'s Lowell Bergman and Laura Holson and Joe 
Kahn of The New York Times. 
Joe, aren't these power companies doing exactly what they are supposed to be 
doing, which is maxi--maximizing profits and to get the biggest return for 
their shareholders? 
Mr. KAHN: Sure. That's their responsibility. They--they have no excuse for 
arbitrarily lowering the price that they could charge for electricity if the 
market will bear a higher price. 
BURY: Lowell Bergman, in your documentary, do you find any evidence that the 
power companies are--are gouging consumers or doing anything illegal? 
BERGMAN: Well, illegality, no one really has any serious evidence, although 
there have been lots of allegations and there's been lots of speculation 
about it. But we should also point out in the documentary and in The Times 
that some of the companies are starting to realize, it seems, that even 
though they are owed hundreds of millions, in some cases $500 million or more 
still by these bankrupt utilities, they're going to have to take a hair cut 
as Governor Davis describes it. They're going to have to make some bargain. 
And I think we may... 
BURY: Let me jump in there. What do you mean they're going to have to get a 
hair cut? 
BERGMAN: Well, apparently, that's Governor Davis's way of telling them that 
they're going to have to take less to a--less than a full dollar payment for 
what they are owed, and that there has to be some kind of settlement here of 
between the various parties, other we're not--otherwise we won't see any 
progress. 
BURY: Lowell, one of the old cliches in investigative reporting is follow the 
money. And much has been made of this argument that the Bush administration, 
accusations have been made, that the Bush administration is too cozy with the 
power companies and the power company regulators. What did you find in your 
reporting? 
BERGMAN: Well, we found that Vice President Cheney was very up front about 
it, I mean, about his relationship with Ken Lay, the head of Enron, the fact 
that he built a stadium for Enron when he was head of Halliburton. You know, 
the vice president is the first CEO of a Fortune 500 company to hold 
presidential office in the history of the United States. So--but they are 
very open and up front and balance this relationship with their friends and 
with the people who they feel comfortable with. 
BURY: Laura Holson, this idea that so many Texas companies are profiting from 
California's misery, as it were, I suppose Californians find that 
particularly infuriating. 
Ms. HOLSON: It's funny, in the San Francisco Bay area when I was growing up 
near there, there was this great rivalry between the San Francisco 49ers, 
which is, as we all know, a football team and the Dallas Cowboys. And that 
seems to be replaced, if you will, with consumers in California who look at 
Texas gen--at, you know, a lot of the power generators, which are based in 
Texas, and who they feel now are just, you know, making a lot of money off 
them. It's--there's always been a rivalry between those two states. And now I 
think it's deeply personal because it's hitting consumers, or as they believe 
it, it's hitting them in their pocket books. 
BURY: Joe Kahn, how long before these new power plants are going to be coming 
on line? And before they do, or in the time before they do, what--what is it 
that the federal government can do to help California out? 
Mr. KAHN: Well, it--it will probably be about 18 months before sufficient new 
power comes online in California to start substantially changing the supply 
and demand equation there. And that's a very speedy pace. That's with a very 
expedited permit process for new plants. The governor in California has put a 
lot of effort into building new plats--plants quickly. 
BURY: So what happens between now and then? 
Mr. KAHN: Well, that's the question. That's the debate. The Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission has the power under the Federal Power Act, in fact some 
people argue it has the obligation under the Federal Power Act to ensure that 
just and reasonable electricity rates prevail in California at all times. It 
can't just selectively choose the times. And it has already found at the end 
of last year that rates in California are unjust and unreasonable. 
BURY: So what's it doing about that? 
Mr. KAHN: Well, it's--it's tried a variety of compromise measures so far, 
very limited price controls on certain kinds of electricity sales during 
emergency hours. So far that appears to be an insignificant contribution to 
reducing the overall electricity bill in California. 
BURY: Laura, Governor Davis is demanding wholesale price controls. President 
Bush has made it pretty clear that he's not going to lean that way. What 
options does Governor Davis have? 
Ms. HOLSON: You know, it's--again he's stuck in this place where it--it 
doesn't look like he's got any kind of real out. I mean, he can try to 
demand. He can demand as much as he wants from the power generators, but if 
the federal government doesn't step in, he really can't do anything. The 
interesting thing, at least I see kind of going forward, is how Californians 
have really adapted to a really, you know, awful situation. There's a law 
that's being proposed right now in California in which businesses will know 
months in advance whether their neighborhood is going to be impacted by a 
blackout so they can plan. I mean, we've almost turned into--if anybody 
remembers traveling through Italy during their college days, you always kind 
of knew when the airlines or the trains were going to go on strike because 
they told you a day ahead of time. And that's very much what's happening in 
California where they're warning people, you know, two days, an hour, you 
know, one day ahead of time so that they can prepare. 
BURY: That's a pretty dark scenario. Lowell, we just have a few seconds left, 
what lessons should the rest of the country take from California's crisis? 
BERGMAN: Well, watch your--your heating bills, your natural gas bills, which 
are to a certain extent reflected in your electricity bills. And don't think 
that this couldn't happen where you are. And I think that the industry itself 
is beginning to understand that the crisis in California may, in fact, impact 
on the future of deregulation nationally. 
BURY: Lowell Bergman, Laura Holson, Joe Kahn, thank you so much for joining 
us tonight. 
BERGMAN: Thank you. 
Mr. KAHN: Thank you. 
Ms. HOLSON: Thank you. 
BURY: When we come back, an update on a NIGHTLINE broadcast from just over a 
month ago. 
Announcer: To receive a daily e-mail about each evening's NIGHTLINE and a 
preview of special broadcasts, logon to the NIGHTLINE page at abcNEWS.com. 
(Commercial break) 
BURY: In May, we profiled the case of death row inmate Johnny Paul Penry, 
convicted of murdering the sister of a former pro football player. Today, the 
Supreme Court overturned Penry's death sentence. It ruled, six to three, that 
the jury did not have clear instructions on how to weigh his mental 
retardation when it sentenced him. The court will take up the broader issue, 
whether executing the mentally retarded is cruel and unusual punishment, in 
its next term. 
That's our report for tonight. I'm Chris Bury in Washington. For all of us 
here at ABC News, good night.
