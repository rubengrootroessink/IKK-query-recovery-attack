Folks:
My apologies.  This is not proofed, but I wanted to make sure that everyone 
had a chance to review and comment.  Apologies for any unintentional 
omissions and errors.  I think it tracks closely with the direction agreed to 
on the call today.  All comments are encouraged and welcome.

Best,
Jeff
