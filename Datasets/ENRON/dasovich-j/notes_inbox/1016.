Guys,

There are a couple of analyst reports on Sempra in the directory:     
O/Portland/Origlist/AnalystReports

Some fluff, some generic background, some insight.  One concern that jumps 
out is the analyst's comments about trading and risk management being a 
Sempra strength.  

Lets talk thim morning

Chris
