Ladies & Gentlemen:  

I apologize for the confusion regarding this meeting but we are now going to 
call off Monday's meeting (12/4)  and just stick to the one already scheduled 
for Thursday, December 7th.  This meeting will be held in 43C1 and the call 
in numbers remain the same as listed below. 

Once again, there will be no November 30th or December 4th TAR&L meeting.  
Please call me at 37097 if I may be of further assistance.
