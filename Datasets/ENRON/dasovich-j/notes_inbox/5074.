Powerline broadband does last mile---Goes through meters,transformers in=20

Powerline Technologies Inc (PTI) expects to have commercial broadband and=

powerline modems ready by the fall now that it has completed a=20
full-scalefield trial.

It=01,s the first successful test in the US that solved the problem of avoi=
ding=20
transformers and meters, noted CEO Rick Rumbarger.

The basic technology of PTI=01,s hardware was developed in Europe and adapt=
ed to=20
the US by M@inNet.net --the Israeli-based powerline communications firm=20
formed Powerline Technologies with US-based energy marketer PowerTrust.

They=01,ve taken the concept from the lab, putting it on the grid and prove=
d to=20
the world it works, said Rumbarger. PTI=01,s core technologies are in use i=

Germany, Italy, Spain, France, Brazil and Sweden.  PTI used the latest=20
version of its technology to provide internet broadband services to single=

southwest of Atlanta.

=01&It=01,s the only technology that we=01,re aware of that can go through =

and transformers,=018 besides meeting European emissions standards,he added=

Services were delivered over a live power grid using overhead and undergrou=

lines.

The last mile refers to the leg from the user=01,s home to where it hooks i=
nto=20
the main wires but in this case the connection included the last inch linki=
ng=20
a building=01,s outlets into a network.Consumers can move from room to room=
 and=20
still connect to the internet.

Home networking is popular these days but requires some expertise and is=20
considered a hassle to set up.The powerline connection allows various=20
computers to connect to the internet without relying on a network router.

PTI=01,s broadband worked on low and medium voltage grids. The technology=
=20
developed by PTI accomplishes one more feat in that it can push a broadband=
=20
signal over long distances without turning the line into an antenna picking=
=20
up stray signals.It will revolutionize broadband by giving everyone with=20
electricity an ability to have a high-speed internet connection.That would=

solve the problem of rural areas being left out of the broadband advance.

Telephone service can be offered as well as video on demand, Rumbarger note=

Utilities will be able to use the system for automated meter reading servic=

utilities that can offer these services using an infrastructure that=01,s=
