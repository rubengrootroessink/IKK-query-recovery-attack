Hi fellow Haas students, faculty, staff:

I thought I might throw in an invitation for a short-but-sweet dive trip
down south over memorial day if you haven't any plans yet.  Through
Redwoods@Haas, this May dive trip will be a 5-day, 4-night all inclusive
trip open to divers and non-divers.  The objective is simply to "decompress"
after the semester: you can dive, hike/explore, lay out, read, or simply do
nothing for a long weekend.

More details to follow - and can be accessed through the Redwoods@Haas
alias, so sign up to the alias if you are interested.-jim

1)  5 days, 4 nights accommodations, double occupancy
2)  Roundtrip airfare from LAX
3)  R/T transfers airport/hotel in Cozumel
4)  4 days of 2-tank boat dives

9)  Includes use of Tanks, weights; also includes taxes, service charges

Hotel:  Plaza Las Glorias Hotel - right on the water, has about the largest
rooms in any hotel in Cozumel, walking distance of San Miguel, the only town
in Cozumel.  The diving outfit will pick up and drop off the divers from the
Hotel on the dive days. (check out website to get a good idea on what the
hotel looks like!

Other info: 1)  For days that you don't want to dive, there are
opportunities to go visit the Mayan ruins, museums, beaches, visits
to the mainland by ferry.  I will get more information as questions arise.

2)  Up to 10 divers per boat, but 8 is ideal.

3)  Budget for food will be around $25 a day

4)  Free equipment includes Masks, Snorkels, BCDs, Fins,
Wetsuits. (but I recommend bringing your own)

5)  2-tank boat dives depart hotel around 0800 and return
1300.  Surface interval will be lunch on a beach somewhere

6)  Depart LAX on May 25 at 7:00 am, change planes in Mexico
city and
arrive Cozumel at 3:20 pm. Depart Cozumel on May 30 at 2:35
pm, change
planes in Cancun and arrive LAX at 9:20 pm

7)  We could probably set up a diving certification for
those interested in getting certified - you'll take lessons here,
and finish off your certification dives in Cozumel!
