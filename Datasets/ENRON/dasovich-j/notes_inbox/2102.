Wine Team Picks: Tim Gaiser on Heroic Wines

"heroic" when it has a bold, distinct character and far surpasses my=20
expectations in terms of complexity and value. Here are my current=20
heroic picks:=20

Wine with Chocolate: Dry or Sweet?

The holidays are a time of indulgence, and chocolate is pure=20
indulgence. Pairing it with wine, however, is a tricky -- even=20
controversial -- endeavor.=20

"There are two camps: those who believe that dry wines like Merlot=20
and Cabernet Sauvignon are good with chocolate, and those who prefer=20
it with sweet wines," says wine.com Senior Wine Merchant Tim Gaiser,=20
summing up the controversy.=20

The dry-wine camp "thinks that the bitterness of tannin is a good=20
match with the bitterness of chocolate," says Gaiser. It may seem odd=20
to be discussing dessert (which most people would consider sweet) in=20
terms of bitterness, but as Gaiser points out, "That's the flavor of=20
cocoa, which is found in all high-quality chocolate."=20

Gaiser believes that some Merlots can handle this assignment "because=20
of their soft tannins and the supple, seductive quality of their=20
fruit." Wine.com's sampler gift pack of Ballentine Merlot and=20
Scharffen Berger Chocolate plays on this flavor profile.=20

The more traditional palate prefers sweet wines to match the sugar in=20
chocolate and offset its bitterness. For this, Gaiser says the wine=20
"has to be really ripe and intense. High alcohol is almost necessary,=20
because it implies ripeness and richness."=20

In this category, he suggests that "port is probably best --=20
especially tawny port. Australian liqueur Muscats like Stanton &=20
Killeen are also terrific, as are fine cream sherries, such as the=20
1972 Bodegas Toro Albala Pedro Ximenez Don Gran Reserva (375 ml)
or the Emilio Lustau Moscatel Las Cruces 100 Anos. Wine.com also=20
offers a Decadent Dessert pack that pairs an outstanding Schuetz=20
Oles Port with melt-in-your-mouth XOX chocolate truffles.=20

Although he loves sweet German wines, Gaiser steers away from them=20
when it comes to chocolate. "You need the depth of red grape=20
varieties," he says. "One very influential wine writer thinks that=20
the perfect wine for chocolate is Banyuls. It's a Grenache-based red=20
wine, fortified to 18-20 percent alcohol." For an already-assembled=20
combo, try our Banyuls and Chocolate Bars gift pack, which includes=20
the 1998 L'Abbe Rous Banyuls Rimage with six of the finest chocolates=20
available. Gaiser also points out that "Some Banyuls are capable of=20
aging, just like port". As proof, try the 1993 L'Abbe Rous Banyuls=20
Grand Cru Christian Reyal.=20

If you want to stick to unfortified wine from the United States,=20
nothing could be more appropriate than late-harvest Zinfandel, whose=20
raspberry-tinged varietal character is a classic match=20
with chocolate.=20

When it comes to the final ingredient, wine.com has several=20
first-rate holiday chocolates to offer. Some already have wine inside=20
them -- for example, Wine-Filled Chocolates and Chocolate Champagne=20
Corks. For a delicious Italian milk chocolate with hazelnuts, try=20
Vineyard Chocolates.=20
