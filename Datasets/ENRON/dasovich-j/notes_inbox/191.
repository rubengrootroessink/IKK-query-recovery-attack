Greetings:

Here's the ISO's original, redlined response to the NDA we originally sent.   
It includes my comments (in double brackets in caps) in paragraphs 4 and 
14..  We've agreed to their changes provided they agree to the changes to 
their modifications that Gil suggests.  They have agreed.  Please see 
paragraphs 4 and 14, which deal with nondisclosure and venue for disputes, 
respectively.  When you're done with the changes and it's clean, please 
forward to me and I'll forward along to the ISO's attorney for ISO signature. 
 As always, thanks a million for you help.

Best,
Jeff
