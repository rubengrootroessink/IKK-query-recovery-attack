This was a really sweet message.  I wanted to share it.  By the way, I 
learned from Kent's brother just yesterday that Kent's death was attributed 
to viral meningitis.  Just goes to show that you need to live each day to the 
fullest.

Sue - 
I'm Tom Thompson. Kent was a long-time friend, a fishing buddy, and a bad 
golf mate (but lots of fun).  When Gary Ackerman announced at services for 
Kent the creation of the award, I was deeply touched and impressed.
My good friend Jeff Dasovich told me this weekend that you received the very 
first award, and well, I must say I became a bit teary-eyed.  You probably 
don't know me, but I've seen you at Commission meetings and have heard your 
name over the recent years.  My other fishing friend, Bill Sandoval, who was 
also at the services, says whomever received this award "must be a real 
tiger" and we need more people like that in California.
I am happy that Kent's memorial award will go to someone so deserving.
