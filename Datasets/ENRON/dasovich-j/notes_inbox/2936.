Internet Daily for Thursday, May 24, 2001

Virus watchers hit by vandals

The Computer Emergency Response Team based at Carnegie Mellon
University spends its days trying to keep the Internet safe from
hackers and other troublemakers. But this week it's been the
target.

The CERT Web site was hit with denial-of-service attacks, in
which online vandals make a number of computers, sometimes
without the knowledge of their owners, hit a Web site so many
times that nobody else can get to the site. CERT's site was tied
up for much of the day Tuesday and Wednesday. Phone calls to the
center were answered by a recorded voice saying the Web site
would be tied up until the attacks subsided.

While the center routinely carries information regarding computer
viruses and ways to detect and fix them, there are no known ways
to stop denial-of-service attacks.

RSA brings security to PlayStation

RSA Security said it will offer security software for Sony's
PlayStation2. This will allow developers to make online shopping
and gaming applications secure, letting PS2 owners freely access
Internet-based gaming, content and commerce applications.

"The demand for network-based content and services is growing
rapidly as broadband becomes mainstream," said RSA Vice President
Scott Schnell in a press release. "RSA Security is committed to
supporting content software development for PlayStation2 with
effective, standards-based security capabilities and the
technical support to back them up."

ReturnBuy expands eBay offerings

A company that collects returned merchandise from retailers and
sells it at a discount said it will peddle more of its like-new
goods on eBay . ReturnBuy, based in Ashburn, Va., said it has a
new strategic alliance with the online auction site and a
customized software connection that lets it access the service
directly. The company says it can get more for a returned item by
selling it on eBay than a retailer can through traditional means.
Returned merchandise is sent straight to ReturnBuy, which sells
through a number of online and offline channels. Financial terms
of the deal were not announced.

Hospital peddles domain names for newborns

Parents of newborns in Redwood City, Calif., will find a new form
amid the paperwork they must complete for birth certificates,
Social Security numbers and other essentials: A domain name
application. Sequoia Hospital is working with Namezero.com to
offer parents the chance to give the new arrival a domain name.
The name will be free for the first year and $29.95 a year after
that, the San Jose Mercury News reported. The Silicon Valley
hospital sees a lot of parents who are Web savvy and want sites
right away for baby pictures and other information, Sequoia nurse
Linda Kresge told the newspaper.

Neil Chase, managing editor for CBS.MarketWatch.com in San
Francisco, is filling in for Frank Barnako.
