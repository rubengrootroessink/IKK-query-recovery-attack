Hi Evening MBA students:

Thanks for all of your e-mail responses for Round II of registration!

We will review your requests over the next few weeks and will confirm your
Spring 2001 schedules on December 8 (please see my Oct. 27 memo on
registering for classes).

My work hours are typically 11:30-8:30 M-Th and 9-5 on Fridays.  E-mails
are the best so that I can note the date and time of your request and to
keep accurate records.

If you  have something urgent and need to contact me immediately, please
do so by telephone as that is the quickest way to contact me. I can be
reached at (510) 643-0435.  Just leave a message if I'm away from my desk
as I check my phone messages often.

FEE PAYMENTS
Please note that Spring 2001 fees total $10,513.50, split into 5 payments
of $2102.70.  These fees do not include health insurance.  Please disregard
the Spring 2001 Fee Schedule on page 4 on my October 27 memo.

Thanks,
TJ
