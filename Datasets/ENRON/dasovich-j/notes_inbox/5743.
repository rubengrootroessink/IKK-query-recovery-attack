Does this mean we haven't talked to Mike about a response yet?  I will do 
that, if we haven't talked to him yet.  Let me know and also if you have his 
phone number handy that would help.

Leslie, if it's at all possible for you to assist by coordinating with Mike 
Day and his office, that would be immensely helpful.  If not, no worries.  
Just let me know.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff/Jim-

I assume Jeff is handling the response to the ORA/TURN filing to alter the 
PG&E tariffs on gas diversions.  Let me know if you need anything from me on 
that or anything else.  Thanks.
