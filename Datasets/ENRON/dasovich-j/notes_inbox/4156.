To follow is a message regarding practice interviews offered by Accenture.
THIS IS NOT AN AVENUE TO A JOB WITH ACCENTURE, rather, you're helping the
company to develop their interview process and train their recruiters. So if
you volunteer, please don't put the press on these people . . .



Accenture is looking for seven individuals to serve as experienced practice
interviewees at our San Francisco office on Thursday, May 24th. The session
will be held from 1pm-5pm, and lunch will be served. In addition to earning
$50, participants will be reimbursed for their travel expenses to and from
the session.

Participants will:
Meet with Accenture executives to conduct practice interviews.
Receive feedback from real interviewers.
Get paid $50 plus round trip transportation expenses.


Criteria : Individuals in any master's degree program with a 3.0 GPA and 2+
years of work experience.

Interested students should email resumes to Christina Roemer at
christina.roemer@accenture.com. Resumes will be reviewed and potential
participants will be contacted via telephone. Then a confirmation for
participation will be sent via email with specific information regarding
the session.

***NOTE: These interviews are for PRACTICE PURPOSES ONLY and have no
bearing on future interviewing and/or employment opportunities with
Accenture.***
