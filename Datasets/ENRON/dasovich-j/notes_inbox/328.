Power Online  Newsletter  -- http://www.poweronline.com
Volume 3   Issue 84
Friday, September 08, 2000
================================================================
Welcome to this issue of Power Online's (http://www.poweronline.com) 
electronic
newsletter. David Wojick's new Power Vision adds some interesting growth to 
his
NOx issue tree, and considering the EPA's plan for even tougher regulations, 
it
certainly is worth tuning into the discussion. For those of you who have had
trouble downloading or getting to the tree in the past, have no fear. We've
worked it out, so you should click on the link and be taken directly into the
tree. Cathy Swirbul adds another part to her series on fuel cells, with "Fuel
cell reliability versus grid-delivered central station power" in Power 
Online's
Features & Case Studies section. So check it all out, and until next time, 
take
care. ACM
