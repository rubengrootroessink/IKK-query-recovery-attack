Dan Walters: Who will pay for power -- and how much -- back on front burner


(Published July 30, 2001)=20
From its onset a year ago, California's energy crisis has always encompasse=
d=20
two aspects -- price and supply.=20
In the real world of energy distribution, the two are intimately connected.=
=20
Prices will rise when supplies are constricted and fall during periods of=
=20
abundance. Rising prices, meanwhile, will have a major effect on demand,=20
which directly relates to supply.=20
California's politicians, from Gov. Gray Davis downward, have tended to tre=
at=20
the two as distinct factors. The question that's hovered over the crisis,=
=20
although rarely voiced publicly, is whether the rate-paying and voting publ=
ic=20
would be less tolerant of price spikes or power interruptions.=20
When the crisis first surfaced in San Diego last summer, Davis and the=20
Legislature saw it almost purely as a matter of price. San Diegans' power=
=20
bills were spiking as their local utility adjusted rates to meet its=20
wholesale power costs, and the Capitol responded with an expedient scheme=
=20
that rolled back retail prices, but did nothing about the wholesale costs.=
=20
The utility began amassing debts to cover the rate-cost gap and within a fe=
w=20
weeks, other utilities -- their rates frozen by law -- began running up eve=
n=20
larger debts that eventually surpassed $13 billion.=20
By early this year, however, the threat of power blackouts assumed a greate=
r=20
political importance, and when the utilities had their credit cut off becau=
se=20
of their huge debts, Davis and the Legislature began running up their own=
=20
multibillion-dollar debts to keep the lights burning. For most of this year=
,=20
supply was the chief political focus, but so far, the threat of blackouts=
=20
appears to have eased. Conservation awareness, higher power bills and=20
unusually cool weather in much of the state have kept demand below supply=
=20
limits, although August and September could still pose a threat.=20
With supply worries muted, price is once again becoming the chief political=
=20
focus in several interwoven fronts. Who will pay for the $20 billion-plus i=
n=20
debts run up by the utilities and the state? Who'll cover the costs of the=
=20
state's $43 billion (at least) in contracts for future supplies? Will the=
=20
rate increases already approved by the state Public Utilities Commission th=
is=20
year be sufficient to cover all needs for revenue? Or is someone playing a=
=20
game of "hide the pea"?=20
There are multiple claimants for the revenue stream, and each faction is=20
claiming, in effect, that its share of the money can be covered under=20
existing rates, implicitly pointing the finger at some other claimant if, i=
n=20
fact, rates must be raised.=20
One example of the complex conflict over money surfaced last week, when the=
=20
Davis administration declared its "revenue requirement" for past and future=
=20
power purchases can be covered without another rate increase. But when the=
=20
details were released a day later, the numbers had been changed -- a change=
=20
the administration says does not alter its conclusions -- and critics=20
emerged.=20
The chief naysayer is Pacific Gas and Electric Co., the state's largest=20
utility, which took itself into bankruptcy court last spring. PG&E issued a=
=20
blistering analysis of the state's report, citing "missing data,=20
discrepancies and conflicting claims." And the utility demanded a full=20
hearing on both the state's numbers and its intent that all future costs be=
=20
passed on to ratepayers automatically, without PUC review.=20
PG&E officials are talking about challenging the state's revenue report not=
=20
only before the PUC, but before the Office of Administrative Law, which=20
governs regulations issued by state agencies, and perhaps in the courts. If=
=20
unresolved, the conflict could hold up the sale of the state's long-stalled=
,=20
$13.4 billion bond issue to cover its power-purchase debts and thus create =
a=20
state cash-flow squeeze.=20
Underlying the confrontation is PG&E's suspicion that the state, by skimmin=
g=20
its share off the top of the revenue stream, is insulating Davis from=20
political fallout and setting up utilities to take the blame for future rat=
e=20
increases.=20
Could crass politics be driving the state's power-pricing strategy? Heaven=
=20
forbid.=20

Power grab: Before you sign, get facts
By Robert A. Masullo=20
Bee Time & Money Writer
(Published July 30, 2001)=20
The large newspaper advertisement sounded enticing: "Last year natural gas=
=20
rates soared 350%. This year you can lock in a rate that will soar 0% ...=
=20
With guaranteed pricing from the NewPower Co., Californians can avoid such=
=20
increases this winter."=20
Exactly what is NewPower, a recently formed gas and electric supplier based=
=20
in Purchase, N.Y., offering?=20
Two deals, says company spokeswoman Terri Cohen.=20
In the first, a customer agrees to buy natural gas from NewPower for two=20
years and the company will guarantee a monthly price of 80 cents a therm, t=
he=20
unit used for measuring natural gas for billing purposes.=20
In the second, a customer agrees to buy natural gas from NewPower for two=
=20
years and the company guarantees a therm rate of 40 cents from June through=
=20
August and 83 cents from September through May.=20
In both cases, a monthly service charge of $2.99 is tacked on, and customer=
s=20
will pay a $50 penalty if they break the contract before two years is up.=
=20
Are the NewPower offers good deals? Perhaps. It depends on what happens in=
=20
the natural gas market.=20
Last winter, nationwide shortages in the natural gas supply caused prices t=
o=20
shoot up to around $2 a therm. When consumers opened their winter heating=
=20
bills, they were shocked.=20
But prices have been dropping considerably since then. Per therm rates were=
=20
78 cents in May, 60 cents in early July, and 40 cents just a few days ago.=
=20
During the course of a year, the highest prices for natural gas are always =
in=20
winter, when usage is great, and lowest in summer, when usage is minimal.=
=20
According to Pacific Gas & Electric, the traditional supplier of natural ga=
s=20
in the area, natural gas prices usually average around 70 cents a therm in=
=20
winter and 30 cents a therm in summer.=20
So if natural gas rates go back to what they were last winter, then=20
NewPower's offers may be excellent deals. But if rates go down, they may be=
=20
poor choices.=20
It's up to the consumer, then, to make an educated guess about which way=20
rates will go. But new drilling for natural gas could indicate that supply=
=20
will be plentiful in the coming years.=20
Dan Jacobson is the legislative advocate for the California Public Interest=
=20
Research Group, a consumer organization. He's skeptical of NewPower's offer=
s.=20
"It sounds to me like (NewPower's) main aim is to get consumers to commit t=
o=20
a long-term contract," he says. "That's something I would always advise=20
caution on. Long-term contracts -- for natural gas or anything else -- are=
=20
fraught with danger.=20
"It's possible, of course, that natural gas prices will go back to what the=
y=20
were last winter. But that seems highly unlikely. What I've been hearing,=
=20
instead, is that there will be a glut of natural gas next year. Then prices=
=20
would be lower and NewPower's deal would be a very bad one, indeed."=20
Claudia Chandler, assistant executive director of the California Energy=20
Comission, the state's primary energy policy and planning agency, said much=
=20
the same. "Storage is up," she says, "and we believe there will ample=20
supplies of natural gas this fall and winter."=20
Unlike NewPower, PG&E sets its natural gas prices according to market price=
s,=20
which fluctuate daily. PG&E spokeswoman Staci Homrig says PG&E encourages=
=20
people "to shop around for the for the best price."=20
NewPower is able to make these offers because of deregulation of the energy=
=20
industry. Deregulation allows NewPower -- and other companies -- to compete=
=20
with firms that own the natural gas delivery systems, such as PG&E. Prior t=
o=20
deregulation, delivery system companies were the only suppliers of natural=
=20
gas.=20
Of course, deregulation in California is a controversial issue, with many=
=20
blaming it for the current electricity crisis. As far as natural gas goes,=
=20
deregulation permits the old gas-and-electric companies, such as PG&E, to=
=20
continue as the sole owner of the delivery systems -- pipes, meters and=20
related hardware. But now they have competition supplying the gas.=20
NewPower is closely allied with Enron Corp., the Texas energy giant, which=
=20
owns about 40 percent of the company, according Cohen, the NewPower=20
spokeswoman.=20
Currently, only three companies -- PG&E, NewPower, and ACN Energy Inc. of=
=20
Farmington Hills, Mich., which offers natural gas at market rates -- are=20
supplying natural gas to this area. More companies, however, can be expecte=

Huge PG&E bankruptcy case creates many conflicts of interest
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The third largest bankruptcy in U.S. history is also=
=20
becoming the most complex. As Pacific Gas and Electric Co. wades through it=
s=20
pile of debts, many of the legal and financial teams representing the utili=
ty=20
and its creditors often run into conflicts of interest.=20
Since PG&E is so large and far reaching, it may be difficult to find firms=
=20
and businesses that are not somehow associated with the utility. In additio=
n,=20
many large accounting and legal agencies are getting involved because of=20
their expertise in bankruptcy cases.=20
"Very few people have the expertise for high-profile, high-stakes=20
bankruptcies, so you have a small pool from which to draw representation, a=
nd=20
that's where . . . potential conflicts come up," Nancy B. Rapoport, a=20
University of Houston law professor who's a bankruptcy ethics expert, told=
=20
the Los Angeles Times.=20
Since the utility filed for Chapter 11 protection in April, its lead counse=
l,=20
Howard, Rice, Nemerovski, Canady, Falk & Rabkin already has racked up $2.65=
=20
million in the first two months of the case. Last year, that same firm=20
reported earning $1.9 million from PG&E.=20
The total court-approved amount in the filing could reach at least $470=20
million, said Lynn LoPucki, UCLA law professor and expert on bankruptcy=20
practice.=20
"The bigger the case, the bigger the fees," LoPucki told the Times, calling=
=20
the bankruptcy "one of the most complex cases ever."=20
PG&E's bankruptcy ranks third behind Texaco Inc. and Financial Corp. of=20

And about a dozen companies are in line for contracts to work for PG&E or t=
he=20

or=20
ethical dilemmas to occur already exists based on the firms approved by the=
=20
case's Judge Dennis Montali.=20
For example, the utility's primary law firm also represents banking interes=
ts=20
linked to nearly $1 billion in debts. PG&E's accounting firm also has worke=
d=20
for more than 80 companies involved in the bankruptcy case, including some=
=20
creditors.=20
Experts say the multitude of conflicts surrounding the case could allow=20
professional firms to alter outcomes to benefit certain companies while=20
hurting PG&E.=20
"By traditional conflict standards, the large firms could not participate i=
n=20
the cases," LoPucki said. "There has been a huge shift in what is acceptabl=
e.=20
It is more lenient. A firm is allowed to represent clients today where they=
=20
would not have been allowed 20 years ago."=20
Some firms have submitted disclaimers describing the ties and in some cases=
=20
have said there are so many connections with various involved companies, th=
ey=20
may not even be aware of them all. While other have created "ethical walls"=
=20
within their companies or have asked clients to sign waivers releasing the=
=20
professionals from conflicts of interest.=20
Accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, which works for PG&E and its parent=
=20
corporation PG&E Corp., agreed to build an "ethical wall" in order to also=
=20
serve as accountant and financial adviser for the committee representing=20
PG&E's creditors. Judge Montali approved the hiring of the accounting firm=
=20
despite objections from Linda Ekstrom Stanley, the U.S. trustee assigned to=
=20
guard against abuses and money-making schemes that can occur during=20
bankruptcy proceedings.=20
Her office has involved itself several times, objecting to everything from=
=20
excessive fees to conflicts.=20
But some say it would be impossible for PG&E's bankruptcy proceedings to mo=
ve=20
forward if every conflict were closely examined.=20
"It would be horrendous," said Daniel Bogart, a law professor at Chapman=20
University. "There are conflicts that matter and those that don't. The=20

Customers' huge 'debt' to SDG&E called sham =20


\
objattph=20
By Craig D. Rose  UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER  July 30, 2001  San Diego's=20
largest consumer group says the dreaded "balancing account" -- a debt of $7=
50=20
million that ratepayers allegedly owe SDG&E -- is a bookkeeping illusion=20
bordering on fraud, and in reality the utility owes its customers money.  I=
n=20
a filing late last week with state regulators, the Utility Consumers' Actio=
n=20
Network joined other consumer advocates in arguing that San Diego Gas &=20
Electric Co. and parent company Sempra Energy created a bogus debt by not=
=20
reporting key profits and by withholding an assortment of overcharges that=
=20
should be rebated to consumers.  When the profits, overcharges and penaltie=
s=20
are appropriately applied against the $750 million claim, UCAN says,=20
consumers would owe less than $50 million. And much or all of that would be=
=20
offset by SDG&E's share of refunds expected to be ordered by federal=20
regulators.=20
The consumer group said the balancing account is "fiction, if not a fraud,"=
=20
that the state appears to have accepted.  UCAN was joined in the filing by=
=20
The Utility Reform Network and Aglet Consumer Alliance, which are based in=
=20
Northern California. The groups made the allegations in opposition to a pla=
n=20
proposed last month by Sempra and Gov. Gray Davis that purports to clear th=
e=20
alleged $750 million debt.  SDG&E disagreed with the consumer groups'=20
position. A company official said the agreement between Sempra and Davis is=
=20
balanced, and the alternative could be a lengthy court fight.  The matter i=
s=20
scheduled to go before the California Public Utilities Commission, perhaps =
as=20
early as Thursday.  UCAN argues that SDG&E's claim of making a $319 million=
=20
contribution toward resolving the debt is "misleading and fallacious."=20
Instead of making any contributions, UCAN says, SDG&E and Sempra stand to=
=20
reap billions in profits from the proposal to clear the debt, and from=20
agreements to sell power lines and electricity to the state.  Fears of a=20
balancing account and potential balloon payment have hung over local utilit=
y=20
ratepayers since last fall, when SDG&E said it began to incur losses by=20
paying more for electricity than it was allowed to collect from customers=
=20
under a state-imposed cap.  Electricity customers could have faced payment =
of=20
the debt as early as next year.  Last month, Davis, flanked by state Sens.=
=20
Steve Peace and Dede Alpert, as well as Sempra officials, announced an=20
agreement he said would eliminate the debt without raising rates. At the sa=
me=20
time, the governor and the company announced a plan for the state to purcha=
se=20
SDG&E's power lines for $1.2 billion but said that was a separate proposal,=
=20
unrelated to the debt plan.  UCAN claims there is a relationship, saying th=
e=20
purchase is another excessive payment to the utility. The consumer group is=
=20
urging the Public Utilities Commission to consider the proposed settlement=
=20
with Sempra in the context of both the transmission line deal and a contrac=
t=20
under which Sempra will sell 1,900 megawatts of electricity to California=
=20
over the next decade.  UCAN also is concerned that SDG&E's profit from the=
=20
power line sale would not be shared with customers. The utility, which the=
=20
state continues to regulate, has shared past gains with its customers.  At=
=20
the heart of the groups' filing, however, is the allegation that SDG&E has=
=20
not accounted for what UCAN estimates is $450 million in profits the utilit=
y=20
will earn from two key electricity purchase contracts. Those gains alone=20
would offset 60 percent of the losses SDG&E claims to have suffered from=20
buying electricity.  The Public Utilities Commission ruled this year that=
=20
profits from these contracts belong to the utility's customers, not its=20
shareholders.  For months during the power crisis, SDG&E described itself a=
s=20
a middleman and said it earned nothing from the sale of electricity to=20
customers. Under the state's deregulation plan that went into effect in 199=
8,=20
the company's profit-making business was supposed to be restricted to the=
=20
delivery of electricity, not the purchase and sale of the commodity. =20
Nonetheless, SDG&E has gone to court seeking to overturn the PUC decision a=
nd=20
take possession of the profits earned from selling electricity. As part of=
=20
the settlement with the state, SDG&E would be awarded ownership of the powe=
r=20
contracts but would agree to refund $219 million.  But SDG&E would earn $12=
0=20
million by selling power to the state from these deals during the second ha=
lf=20
of this year. So UCAN argues that SDG&E's $219 million concession is=20
effectively reduced to less than half that sum.  Sempra also has a separate=
=20
long-term contract to sell electricity to the state. UCAN says that deal al=
so=20
is overpriced.  SDG&E defended its agreement with the state and said the=20
prospect of lengthy litigation over the profits from power contracts should=
=20
be considered in assessing the overall agreement.  "We have a strong case i=
n=20
court," said Edwin Guiles, chairman of SDG&E. "And this overall balanced=20
solution is a better way to deal with it rather than fight it out in court.=
" =20
Guiles also said SDG&E is forgoing $100 million by agreeing to a complex=20
provision to provide power at regulated rates from the San Onofre Nuclear=
=20
Generation Station, instead of whatever rates the market would allow. SDG&E=
=20
is a part owner of the nuclear plant.  The consumer group says SDG&E has no=
t=20
refunded to customers an assortment of overcharges and overcollections=20
totaling $154 million.  UCAN added that under the governor's plan $133=20
million of the debt claimed by Sempra is not eliminated but would be paid o=
ff=20
by consumers through their monthly bills.=20

Nancy McFadden, an adviser to Davis.  For months, Davis and other state=20

Huge Fees, Many Conflicts In PG&E Case
Bankruptcy: The sheer size of the professional firms involved and the vast=
=20
reach of the utility make entanglements almost inevitable.
By TIM REITERMAN
TIMES STAFF WRITER

July 29 2001

SAN FRANCISCO -- When a big bankruptcy case comes along, so does the=20
bankruptcy gang.

After PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric Co. filed for protection from=20
creditors in April, major law firms and other high-priced professionals=20
queued up and began billing.

PG&E's lead counsel already has charged $2.65 million in the first two mont=
hs=20
of a case that some experts say could stretch into years. A financial advis=
or=20
asked for as much as $350,000 a month and once considered seeking a "succes=
s=20
fee" of $20 million if the company's reorganization panned out. A financial=
=20
consultant of the PG&E creditors committee has proposed a $1.5-million fee=
=20
for six months' work. The PG&E case offers an extraordinary view of an arca=
ne=20
field usually outside the limelight.

Total court-approved fees in the bankruptcy filing--the third-largest in U.=
S.=20
history--could amount to at least $470 million, said UCLA law professor Lyn=
n=20
LoPucki, a leading expert on bankruptcy practice.

"The bigger the case, the bigger the fees," he said. But even that figure,=
=20
LoPucki said, could go higher because of the regulatory and public policy=
=20
issues involved in the case, which he described as "one of the most complex=
=20
cases ever."

Along with those huge fees come complex potential conflicts. Ethical proble=
ms=20
have long haunted the bankruptcy field, despite repeated efforts at reforms=
=20
that have followed scandals involving prominent firms. Though the PG&E=20
bankruptcy case is in its earliest stages, entanglements that experts say=
=20
could present ethical issues already have arisen as several prominent firms=
=20
were approved by the bankruptcy judge:

* PG&E's main law firm also represents banking interests that are tied to o=
ne=20
of the utility's biggest debts, a nearly $1-billion credit arrangement.

* PG&E's accounting firm has done unrelated work for more than 80 companies=
=20
involved in the PG&E bankruptcy case, including some of the utility's=20
creditors.

* The law firm for the official committee of PG&E creditors represents a=20
$400-million Arizona power project being developed by an arm of PG&E's pare=
nt=20
company.

* The accounting firm for the committee does work for PG&E and its parent=
=20
company, a corporate relationship being examined by the state's utility=20
regulator.

For shareholders or creditors of a company in bankruptcy proceedings,=20
conflicts can create serious problems. The complex legal and accounting=20
issues that arise in a bankruptcy case provide numerous opportunities for=
=20
professional firms to alter outcomes in ways that benefit a favored company=
=20
and harm the client relying on their advice.

Experts say the sheer size of today's professional firms and the vast reach=
=20
of PG&E, whose business activities touch virtually every sector of=20
California, make conflicts almost inevitable.

"Very few people have the expertise for high-profile, high-stakes=20
bankruptcies, so you have a small pool from which to draw representation, a=
nd=20
that's where . . . potential conflicts come up," said Nancy B. Rapoport, a=
=20
University of Houston law professor and a leading bankruptcy ethics expert.

"Today," LoPucki said, "it's not a question of whether there's a conflict,=
=20
it's how big it is."

Dozens of Firms Vying for Contracts

The bankruptcy case of PG&E, with a reported $31.5 billion in assets, is bi=
g,=20
indeed. Only two cases from the late 1980s, Texaco Inc. and Financial Corp.=
=20
of America, surpass it when measured by the dollar value of the assets at=
=20
stake.

Records show that about a dozen firms are in line for lucrative contracts=
=20
with either PG&E or the official committee representing thousands of the=20
utility's unsecured creditors. So are dozens of other firms that have=20
continuing legal work for the company.

All will be paid from the PG&E bankruptcy estate, if Judge Dennis Montali=
=20
approves their employment.

To become eligible for legal, accounting and consulting work, each firm mus=
t=20
convince the judge that it is qualified to do the job and does not have=20
unmanageable conflicts of interest.

Many firms in the PG&E case have worked with one another or represent parti=
es=20
with a financial interest in the outcome, such as lenders and creditors, in=
=20
matters outside the case.

With the limited number of bankruptcy specialists, "naturally you have=20
lawyers and others working both sides of the fence," said Mary Josephine=20
Newborn Wiggins, professor at the University of San Diego School of Law.=20
"There are bound to be some situations where it gets sticky."

Time and again, firms acknowledged in disclaimers filed with Bankruptcy Cou=
rt=20
that they have so many ties to other companies that they may not have=20
unearthed all connections and potential conflicts. Some addressed potential=
=20
conflicts by erecting "ethical walls" within their own firms or having=20
clients sign waivers that absolve the professionals of conflicts of interes=
t.

Experts say ethical walls amount to honor systems with no outside monitorin=
g=20
and that waivers sometimes are granted without the client's full=20
understanding of the potential conflicts.

They also point out that not all connections between adversarial interests=
=20
constitute conflicts, and not all conflicts are serious enough to disqualif=
y=20
a firm from a case.

The fact that so many issues arise in cases of this magnitude has meant tha=
t=20
the bankruptcy system is forced to make accommodations for big firms with=
=20
overlapping clients.

"By traditional conflict standards, the large firms could not participate i=
n=20
the cases," LoPucki said. "There has been a huge shift in what is acceptabl=
e.=20
It is more lenient. A firm is allowed to represent [clients] today where th=
ey=20
would not have been allowed 20 years ago."

'Ethical Walls' Used to Avoid Conflicts

The complexity of the entanglements--and the manner in which the system has=
=20
adapted to them--can be seen in the roles played in the PG&E case by two of=
=20
the nation's largest accounting firms, Deloitte & Touche and=20
PricewaterhouseCoopers, and one of its most prominent law firms, Milbank,=
=20
Tweed, Hadley & McCloy.

When PG&E proposed hiring Deloitte & Touche for a base fee of $855,000 and =
an=20
hourly rate of $450 to $650 for partners, the U.S. trustee in the case, Lin=
da=20
Ekstrom Stanley, objected.

The U.S. trustees office is an arm of the Department of Justice that Congre=
ss=20
created in 1978 to help combat what critics derisively dubbed bankruptcy=20
rings. The trustees administer bankruptcy cases and are instructed to guard=
=20
against abuses and profiteering by professionals.

So far in the PG&E case, Stanley's office has weighed in against the=20
appointments of several major companies, voicing objections ranging from=20
excessive fees to conflicts. Her office succeeded in preventing the credito=
rs=20
committee from hiring a public relations firm, and it won a tentative rulin=
g=20
that would prevent PG&E from indemnifying a financial consulting firm again=
st=20
negligence claims arising from its work.

The investment banking firm, Dresdener, Kleinwort & Wasserstein, has stoppe=
d=20
working for PG&E because of the lack of indemnification. PG&E is hunting fo=
r=20
a new financial consultant.

In the case of Deloitte & Touche, Stanley's office seized on the company's=
=20
disclosure that it had worked not only for PG&E but also for its parent=20
company and for another subsidiary, PG&E National Energy Group. The=20
accounting firm had performed $14.4 million in work last year for the three=
=20
PG&E entities.

The trustee said that work posed a potential conflict because the Californi=
a=20
Public Utilities Commission was reviewing PG&E's controversial transfers of=
=20
funds to its parent company.

Deloitte & Touche argued successfully that its relationships with three PG&=
E=20
entities did not compromise the company's ability to fairly represent PG&E =
in=20
the bankruptcy.

In the interest of full disclosure, Deloitte & Touche reported it formerly=
=20
employed a daughter of Judge Montali. The firm also said it employs the wif=
e=20
of another bankruptcy judge in San Francisco. She logged fewer than 50 hour=
s=20
of tax consulting work last year for PG&E's parent, the firm said.

Ethics experts said such personal connections generally would not be enough=
=20
to prompt a judge to disqualify a firm. "It's obviously an interesting=20
relationship," Rapoport said. "It comes down to . . . how much of an=20
appearance of too much closeness he wants to put up with."

Issues involving the second accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers, arose=
=20
when the committee representing PG&E's creditors proposed hiring the firm a=
s=20
its accountant and financial advisor. Stanley's office objected that the=20
firm, like Deloitte & Touche, works for PG&E and its parent.

"Professionals . . . must have no conflict of interest . . . and owe=20
undivided loyalty to the creditors committee," the trustees office said.

"It is not beyond imagining that [PG&E and its parent] could influence=20
[PricewaterhouseCoopers] through these continuing relationships, the promis=
e=20
of future engagements and other intangibles," the trustee said in one filin=
g.

PricewaterhouseCoopers said it would build an ethical wall within the firm =
to=20
avoid problems or other dicey situations in which PG&E, its parent or=20
affiliates are adversaries. The judge approved the hiring.

Rapoport said such ethical walls do not necessarily prevent improper=20
communications within firms. "I don't think you can rely on an honor system=
=20
or an internalized moral compass. That is why we have rules in the first=20
place," she said.

As its legal counsel, the PG&E creditors committee received permission to=
=20
hire Milbank. The law firm disclosed that it represented some of PG&E's=20
creditors in matters unrelated to the bankruptcy. The firm also represents =
a=20
$400-million Arizona power plant project being developed by a subsidiary of=
=20
PG&E Corp.'s National Energy Group.

Some bankruptcy experts said there was a potential for conflict, but the fi=
rm=20
said the connection was tangential.

In addition, the firm worked for the California Power Exchange, the=20
now-bankrupt entity that under California's deregulation plan served as the=
=20
state's energy marketplace. Milbank resigned that post several weeks before=
=20
the Power Exchange filed its own bankruptcy petition in March. The=20
resignation, Milbank said, was "due to certain potential conflicts with=20
creditors" of the exchange.

One of Milbank's clients is Enron Corp., which, using other counsel, sued t=
he=20
Power Exchange, trying to get back collateral held by the exchange to ensur=
e=20
power deliveries.

Enron now sits on the PG&E creditors committee represented by Milbank.=20
Another of PG&E's creditors is the Power Exchange, which is seeking nearly =
$2=20
billion for energy companies that sold electricity to the utility but were=
=20
not paid. Records show Milbank has filed a claim of about $373,000 against=
=20
the exchange for legal work.

George Sladoje, president and chief executive of the Power Exchange, said h=
e=20
was shocked when Milbank, its longtime counsel, quit. "It was very difficul=
t=20
to find [new] counsel," he said. "There were conflicts all over the place"=
=20
among law firms because so many did legal work for PG&E and Southern=20
California Edison.

Ed Feo, managing partner of Milbank's Los Angeles office, said the company=
=20
did its best to avoid conflicts in both bankruptcy cases--by dropping=20
representation of a client in one and fully disclosing its connections in t=
he=20
other.

As for Milbank's role in the PG&E case, Rapoport said that representing=20
creditors and a creditors committee is "OK as long as their interests do no=
t=20
diverge."

However, she said, "Bankruptcy is like the Chinese game of Go. Moves have=
=20
ramifications 20 steps later."

Disclosure Often Is Safest Legal Course

As a practical matter, the safest course legally in a bankruptcy case is to=
=20
try to disclose every connection and let the judge decide whether to allow =
a=20
firm to participate.

"Disclosure cures a multitude of ills," said Lawrence Gottesman, chairman o=
f=20
the bankruptcy practice at Brown, Raysman, Millstein, Felder & Steiner in N=
ew=20
York City. By contrast, he said, "the penalty for working with an undisclos=
ed=20
conflict can be severe."

Milbank learned that three years ago, when John G. Gellene, once a lawyer=
=20
with the firm, was sentenced to 15 months in prison and fined $15,000 for=
=20
failing to disclose during a bankruptcy case that he also was working for a=
=20
creditor in separate litigation. Before the sentencing, the firm had return=
ed=20
$1.9 million in legal fees and fired Gellene.

To ferret out potential conflicts, firms rely heavily on the computer. Thos=
e=20
involved in the PG&E case, for example, usually checked their computerized=
=20
client lists against the biggest 100 PG&E creditors and other players, such=
=20
as other professional firms, the trustee's staff and the judge.

Even then, there are limits. The computerized checks did not touch tens of=
=20
thousands of smaller PG&E creditors. And the firms themselves commonly issu=
e=20
disclaimers, saying they might not have turned up all their potential=20
conflicts.

If a law firm finds it has a troubling conflict, it also can seek a conflic=
t=20
waiver from its existing client, which essentially gives the firm permissio=
n=20
to pursue dual representation.

PG&E's lead counsel, Howard, Rice, Nemerovski, Canady, Falk & Rabkin,=20
reported receiving $1.9 million from the company in the year before the=20
Chapter 11 filing and it billed $2.65 million in fees and expenses for the=
=20
two months after that.

Among the firm's potential conflicts was its representation of an affiliate=
=20
of Bank of America Corp. The bank participates in a revolving credit=20
agreement that allows PG&E to borrow up to $1 billion. PG&E listed Bank of=
=20
America as the agent for a $938-million claim.

The law firm said its relationship with the Bank of America affiliate was=
=20
"sufficiently attenuated" that it did not need a conflict of interest waive=
r=20
from its client. But the firm sought and received conflict waivers from a=
=20
second bank and the affiliate of a third bank involved in the credit=20
agreement.

There was no objection by the trustees office, and the judge approved hirin=
g=20
the firm. "We see if [a firm has] a disqualifying connection and, if not, w=
e=20
let it go," said Stanley, the U.S. trustee.

Indeed, if every potential conflict were examined closely, some say, the=20
bankruptcy system would grind to a halt.

"It would be horrendous," said Daniel Bogart, a law professor at Chapman=20
University. "There are conflicts that matter and those that don't. The=20
parties have to reach a level of comfort quickly."=20

'Invention' Fueling Only Cries of Fraud
Energy: Tribe promised riches from power plant using secret technology=20
suspects it's been had. Firm's founder, a felon, denies allegations.
By BETTINA BOXALL
TIMES STAFF WRITER

July 28 2001

BISHOP, Calif. -- It would be difficult to write a better spoof of the ener=
gy=20
frenzy than the tale that has been unfolding here on a small Indian=20
reservation.

There is the pony-tailed convicted felon who came to this remote Eastern=20
Sierra town with bodyguards, secrecy agreements and plans for a power plant=
=20
that would reap millions in annual profits for the local tribe, require no=
=20
fuel and produce no pollution.

There was the prototype: two boxes connected to a car chassis suspended off=
=20
the ground. When a switch was flipped, the tires turned. There were the=20
company code names for employees: Falcon, Caesar, Cleopatra.

But it's not a spoof. It's the story of QSFG Research and Development Inc. =
of=20
North Las Vegas and founder Michael J. Marshall, who has left a trail of=20
angry investors, laid-off employees and allegations of fraud from Nevada to=
=20
Hawaii.

Marshall is a silver-haired 47-year-old who boasts, in language grandiose t=
o=20
the point of parody, that he has invented a new technology that will power=
=20
everything from cars to electricity plants and transform the energy industr=
y.

Centuries from now, he declared at a groundbreaking here, "They will be=20
looking back at us, this day right here. We are initiating the start. We ar=
e=20
lighting the match."

He sold company shares at $25,000 a pop, signed a contract to build a=20
250-megawatt power station on the Bishop Paiute reservation and promised=20
investors an energy empire.

In a brief telephone interview Friday, Marshall dismissed all the doubts an=
d=20
allegations.

"I don't care what you write because the truth is the truth. I'm only two=
=20
weeks away from having a prototype showing I can run power stations. It doe=
s=20
work. It does run," insisted Marshall.

"Where the Past Ends and the World's Future Begins," proclaims the brightly=
=20
lettered sign on his now-closed office-warehouse in a North Las Vegas=20
industrial park.

It is a phrase he used before, in New York state, where Marshall spent 2 1/=
2=20
years in prison for fraud and larceny. According to Cortland County files,=
=20
the case involved $25,000 he took from an elderly man to patent an=20
invention--apparently a "fuel-less generator" for cars.

After his release from prison in 1998, Marshall wound up in Las Vegas, wher=
e=20
he incorporated QSFG last year. He started off with plans to outfit cars an=
d=20
trucks with his technology. When California's energy crisis hit, he switche=
d=20
to power plants, becoming one of many offering unusual solutions to the=20
state's electricity problem.

"We're certainly hearing a lot more schemes. Not all of them are=20
unreasonable," said Rich Ferguson, research director at the nonprofit Cente=
r=20
for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies in Sacramento. "This=20
particular thing sounds like a violation of fundamental physical law, so it=
's=20
a little hard to take seriously."

Site at Reservation Has Legal Advantages

Last spring, QSFG sent letters to Las Vegas casinos and Native American=20
tribes in California and Nevada, pitching "a groundbreaking advanced=20
electromagnetic technology" with which the firm could build new energy plan=
ts=20
and retrofit existing ones.

Marshall, who wears a long braid or ponytail, said he was part Cherokee. Bu=
t=20
his interest in tribal land extended beyond any Native American ties. The=
=20
reservations are self-governing, QSFG representatives noted, potentially=20
eliminating local and state red tape and speeding up the approval process.

A few tribes responded, including Bishop and nearby Benton. Marshall and hi=
s=20
entourage paid them a visit in May.

"He reminded me of a used-car salesman," recalled Joseph Saulque, vice=20
chairman of the Benton Paiute tribe. "He talked real fast. He sounded quite=
=20
intelligent and up on what he was talking about. But he refused to let=20
anybody see what he was talking about. He refused to let us see his alleged=
=20
engine."

The Benton tribe didn't pursue the matter. But the larger Bishop reservatio=
n=20
found Marshall's story too tempting to resist: the tribe could make as much=
=20
as $15 million a year in exchange for letting QSFG build a nonpolluting pow=
er=20
plant on three acres of their land.

QSFG signed a contract with the Bishop tribe May 31; the groundbreaking was=
=20
in early June. Shaded from the high desert sun by a large blue-and-white=20
tent, Marshall and a parade of his employees took the microphone like=20
evangelists.

This was the technology of the new millennium, they told a small gathering.=
=20
It was an historic moment akin to the Wright brothers and their first fligh=
t.

"There's what you call closet inventors--I'm one of them," Marshall said.

None of the speakers detailed exactly how the energy plant would work. Ther=
e=20
was mention of rotary power, north polarity and an electromagnetic engine.

All along, Marshall insisted his invention was a carefully guarded secret--=
so=20
valuable that he required bodyguards.

Pressed, he would show people his prototype: a car chassis with a steering=
=20
column and four wheels. In place of the engine were two boxes that he refus=
ed=20
to open. He would jack the chassis off the ground, flip a switch and the=20
wheels would turn.

It wasn't much. But apparently it was enough to convince those who wanted t=
o=20
believe Marshall's engine could be the next big thing, as well as their=20
ticket to millions.

"This man is a very good and fast talker . . . you believe him," said Juani=
ta=20
Ikeda, a former accountant for QSFG. "He was able to get everyone's greed t=
o=20
work against them."

Ikeda, who quit the company in June, says she is the one who discovered=20
Marshall's New York conviction and made sure the Bishop tribe heard about i=
t=20
after the groundbreaking.

Calling the episode "a very embarrassing learning experience," Bishop triba=
l=20
council chairman Monty Bengochia said the tribal development corporation=20
"doesn't anticipate following through with the QSFG agreement."

Marshall laid off his staff early this month. According to the Nevada labor=
=20
commissioner's office, 16 claims for back wages totaling more than $100,000=
=20
have been filed against QSFG by former workers.

In Hawaii, the state Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs is=20
investigating a fraud complaint against Marshall and QSFG by investor Micha=
el=20
H. Wong Sr.

A government engineer who lives in Hawaii, Wong bought a $25,000 share in=
=20
QSFG after hearing about the company from a friend in Las Vegas.

Marshall's invention sounded plausible to Wong. "If this guy has it and wan=
ts=20
to bring it out to the world I was all for it," he said.

But after Marshall canceled several public debuts of his technology, failed=
=20
to pay any dividends and showed Wong nothing more than a car chassis, he=20
doesn't believe he has an invention. "He does not have anything at all," Wo=
ng=20
said.

His Las Vegas friend, Michael Kauffman, is similarly disenchanted. "This wa=
s=20
my first investment. It was very stupid," lamented Kauffman. "It's a wash.=
=20
I'm not getting my money back."

Kauffman says he has complained to the Las Vegas office of the FBI, which=
=20
declined to comment on whether it is investigating.

Former Employees Tell of Ploys

Marshall insists that Wong is furious at him because he won't reveal his=20
technology secrets. "The money went into the corporation, not into my=20
pocket," he said. "As far as me scamming--that is not true."

Many of QSFG's employees and some of the investors knew each other before=
=20
their involvement with the company. They fell into line with Marshall like=
=20
dominoes.

Kauffman heard about Marshall from his roommate, Alesa Beck, who worked in =
a=20
video store Marshall patronized. Marshall gave her an office job in the=20
company. When he was looking for "spokesmodels" to promote QSFG, she referr=
ed=20
him to friends who worked in Vegas as strippers. He hired them.

Kauffman told his sister, Teresa Romero of San Diego, about Marshall's=20
invention and she bought $25,000 in stock. Wong told his son about the=20
company and his son went to work for Marshall. A network of acquaintances=
=20
followed, including a Southern Nevada community college professor of crimin=
al=20
justice who was hired as head of security and later made CEO.

Sitting in the restaurant of a downtown Las Vegas casino recently, Kauffman=
=20
and five ex-employees described an operation sustained by alluring promises=
.

Marshall hired them at handsome salaries, paid them in the beginning and th=
en=20
erratically. He once insisted a solar flare had interrupted the computer=20
transfer of payroll funds. He told them if they would hang on, they'd make =
a=20
fortune.

He assigned code names to the staff--he was Caesar and a young woman he=20
identified as his wife was Cleopatra. He made them sign nondisclosure=20
agreements and claimed he had been nominated for the Nobel Prize.

Ikeda and others say Marshall wanted to create the impression of a healthy=
=20
business when members of the Bishop tribe visited the QSFG offices. But the=
=20
phones had been cut off and there was very little office equipment. So, the=
=20
ex-staffers say, they were instructed to bring in their own personal=20
computers. They spoke in mock conversations on phones that didn't work.

Marshall gave investors binders of material outlining ambitious corporate=
=20
plans to employ thousands and build a string of plants to manufacture auto=
=20
converter kits for his fuel-less engine.

The binders included a November 2000 letter from the Texas governor's offic=
e,=20
signed by George W. Bush. "We would be happy to welcome you to Texas," Bush=
=20
wrote.

It was a generic form letter sent to companies inquiring about setting up=
=20
business in the Lone Star State, but it lent an air of legitimacy to QSFG,=
=20
especially when energy prices were skyrocketing.

"The letter from Gov. Bush. It just all made sense," Romero said.=20

bottom line.=20
The new accusations came as a result of evidence presented at a hearing=20
before a federal regulatory judge in May. El Paso Corp., which has been=20
targeted by state regulators, utilities and legislators convinced it helped=

cause California's disastrous season of soaring energy costs, had hoped tha=
t=20
the hearing would lay all suspicions to rest.=20
Instead, the hearing has given rise to a fresh round of grievances -- not=

Major shippers say that while heating bills soared and California's gas=20
prices were the highest in the nation last winter, they were willing but=20

deliveries -- even though they held contracts for pipeline space.=20

El Paso Corp. has called the claims against its affiliate unfounded. The=20
company says the price rise was caused by dry weather that forced=20

higher rates through 2006 to cover the pipeline's operating costs. In=20
exchange, Greene said, El Paso promised to expand its network if necessary =
to=20

Greene said El Paso was warned in 1999 that gas demand was catching up with=

"If you're El Paso, why go out of your way to build if you can't recover=20

El Paso recently filed plans with the FERC for a new pipeline that would he=

PG&E and Santa Cruz couple in power struggle=20
Posted at 9:45 p.m. PDT Sunday, July 29, 2001=20
BY CHUCK CARROLL=20

Mercury News=20


Ken Adelman, who owns one of the most powerful solar electric systems in=20
California, has had it with PG&E.=20
The utility wants Adelman and his wife, Gabrielle, to pay about $600,000 to=
=20
upgrade the power lines and other equipment in their rural Santa Cruz=20
Mountains neighborhood so their 31-kilowatt system doesn't overload the pow=
er=20
grid.=20
``That's more than I paid for my house,'' said Ken Adelman, a retired tech=
=20
millionaire who spent about $400,000 this spring for the photovoltaic syste=
m=20
with enough juice for about a dozen homes. They intend to feed their excess=
=20
energy back to PG&E for credit to ``zero-out'' their utility bill.=20
The state has been so hungry for new power sources it is offering rebates t=
o=20
solar buyers who hook up to the grid. But the Adelmans can't get their=20
$138,317 rebate until PG&E allows them to go on line.=20
So, after months of wrangling for the right to connect to the grid, Adelman=
=20
flipped the switch himself last week -- with nobody's permission.=20
``I'm sitting here watching my meter run backward,'' said Adelman, who said=
=20
he sent about 10 kilowatts back onto the grid for a 20-minute test that=20
proved his system was safe. ``PG&E is taking out all the guns. And so am I.=
''=20
Pacific Gas & Electric was not amused. Spokesman John Nelson said the compa=
ny=20
didn't know about Adelman's test, but he should have called PG&E so it coul=
d=20
inspect the system before he put any power on the grid. The state's Public=
=20
Utilities Commission requires that, Nelson said.=20
Not only did Adelman's test violate those requirements, it ``possibly creat=
ed=20
a safety threat to himself, PG&E workers and his neighbors,'' Nelson said.=
=20
Fight continues=20
Their fight over power continues. The Adelmans filed a complaint this month=
=20
with state regulators -- starting a process that could wind up being a test=
=20
case for small, independent power generators.=20
They want the PUC to order PG&E to hook up their system at no charge and to=
=20
refund about $500 a month for the electricity they've bought since June 1 t=
o=20
power their 4,200-square-foot home -- with its pool, hot tub, Internet=20
servers and four electric cars in the garage.=20
The Adelmans say a new state law says they shouldn't have to pay a cent to=
=20
hook to the grid.=20
For years, the utilities have been required to allow solar systems of up to=
=20
10 kilowatts to connect to the grid for free, and get credit for the power=
=20
they put online. But in April, lawmakers eager to encourage new sources of=
=20
power raised the limit by 100 times -- to 1 megawatt. Adelman's system is o=
ne=20
of the first to take advantage of the new law.=20
But PG&E is plugged in to a different state rule.=20
Nelson said the utility is bound by a document known as ``Rule 21.'' That=
=20
rule requires the Adelmans -- not ratepayers -- to pay for any upgrades to=
=20
the power system to safely handle the amount of power they want to add to t=
he=20
grid at the end of a circuit that wasn't built for such a load, Nelson said=
.=20
When state lawmakers changed the law to accommodate new power generators in=
=20
April, it didn't automatically change Rule 21, said PUC regulatory analyst=
=20
Valerie Beck, without taking sides in the dispute.=20
Rule must be changed=20
``There's nothing that can be done until Rule 21 is changed,'' Nelson said.=
=20
Connecting solar and wind systems to the grid -- known as ``net metering'' =
--=20
allows owners to get credit on their utility bills for power they feed back=
.=20
The Adelmans don't need all 31 kilowatts of electricity their system could=
=20
produce. And generating all that power off the grid wouldn't make economic=
=20
sense, because they would have to use their batteries every night and wear=

The trading activities of San Diego-based Sempra are drawing increasing=20

is=20
doling out attractive energy contracts to a company that already is flush=

Department of Water Resources, which has been procuring power for the state=

"Sempra has become like the multimillionaire that refuses to tip," said=20
Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network=

in San Diego. "There seems to be a fundamental violation of the principle o=

fairness whereby Sempra's trading arm is hugely profitable at the expense o=

Sempra insists its trading business is a worldwide operation that deals in=

not just electricity but oil, gas and other commodities. Only a small porti=

of the trading unit's profit comes from California and the Western region,=

said company spokesman Doug Kline.=20
State records revealed this month that Sempra Energy Trading--and several=

California .=20
Sempra's activities have come under scrutiny because critics say its tradin=

subsidiary was influential in driving wholesale electricity prices to level=

saddle its own SDG&E, PG&E and Edison with billions of dollars in debt.=20
PG&E and Edison also have energy-trading businesses, though they are not as=
=20
lucrative as Sempra's.=20
California 's 1996 deregulation law created a competitive marketplace where=
=20
more than 100 energy traders now buy and sell electricity . Energy traders=
=20
serve as middlemen, buying power from generators and reselling them to=20
utilities and commercial power users. Some middlemen are connected to firms=

Sempra acquired a trading unit when it bought American International Group=

Inc. for $190 million in 1997. Sempra Energy Trading earned $13 million in=
=20
1998 and $19 million the next year.=20
As the energy crisis exploded, Sempra Energy Trading's profit soared to $15=
5=20

=20
has accounted for $155 million in profit.=20
Critics say Sempra can maximize profit for its trading arm--and various oth=
er=20
business units--by knowing the direction of the market.=20
For example, if executives in Sempra's trading arm know that its sister=20
subsidiary, Southern California Gas Co., is planning to buy large supplies =
of=20
gas for storage, they could structure their trades to take advantage of=20
anticipated higher prices, consumer watchdog groups say.=20

=20
Shames said. "It's classic insider trading for which people like Michael=20

palaces."=20
Sempra and its subsidiaries have denied allegations of insider trading and=
=20
insist that all of the company's activities have been legal. Strict Public=
=20
Utilities Commission rules prohibit Sempra from sharing information among i=
ts=20
business units, said Chairman and Chief Executive Stephen L. Baum.=20
Baum, however, acknowledged that it isn't "particularly healthy" for Sempra=

"I don't like being embarrassed to announce earnings in some of my business=

crisis," Baum said. "That's not a healthy corporate situation."=20
Baum has hinted that the parent company might decide to spin off Sempra=20

For now, the parent company is contesting allegations that Sempra's busines=

In a recent filing with the state Public Utilities Commission, a group of=
=20
primarily municipal generators detailed how the Gas Co. may have acted to=
=20
drive up the price of gas for customers so it could rake in additional=20
profit.=20
In mid-2000, the gas utility paid $16.5 million for option contracts that=
=20
entitled it to buy gas at the end of the year. The contracts gave the Gas C=
o.=20
an incentive to buy "abnormally high" volumes of gas at the California bord=
er=20
during the winter months, said Norman Pedersen, an attorney for the Souther=
n=20
California Generation Coalition.=20
High border purchases by the Gas Co. drove up border prices, Pedersen said,=
=20
allowing the utility to take in $70 million from the deal.=20
The Gas Co. has vigorously denied that the $70-million gain was related to=

California border transactions.=20
"Customers were not only protected by, but directly benefited from [our] . =

e=20
PUC.=20
Under a state incentive program that rewards utilities for keeping costs=20
down, the Gas Co. is required to split savings--such as the $70=20
million--50-50 with ratepayers whenever the company's gas costs fall slight=
