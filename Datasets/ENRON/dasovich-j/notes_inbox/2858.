This is an excerpt from the weekly newsletter of the Western power Trading 
Forum:


"California Attorney General Bill Lockyer made the major mud-slinging event 
of the
week.He said in Monday's WSJ,
"I would love to personally escort [Enron Corp.Chairman Kenneth ] Lay to an 8 
x 10 cell
that he could share with a tattooed dude who says `Hi my name is 
Spike,honey,'"
I was depressed for two days after reading that.What is happening in this 
crazy place?
Elected officials are whipping up public fervor for a lynch mob?The statement 
was
beyond belief....

But here is a surprise that I didn't expect.Two days after the Lockyer quote 
was
published,Kathleen Connell called me,and expressed an apology for her 
"colleague's
statement regarding Enron.I want to distance myself,"she told me,"from that 
kind of
comment."We talked for about 15 minutes.I was stunned,and gratified by her 
remarks.
I asked if I could share her call with you folks,and she agreed."
