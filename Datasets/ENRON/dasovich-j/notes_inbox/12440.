Subject: Proposed Decisions of the CPUC on PX Credit and Suspending Direct 
Access

Two proposed decisions were issued by hard copy and received today.  Jim 
Steffes' office in Houston has a copy.

Both decisions eliminate the requirement that the utilities provide cash 
refunds to the direct access customers for the negative PX Credit as of 
Januray 5, 2000. On other points they differ.

The decision by Assigned Commissioner Wood is adversarial to direct access 
and suspends direct access. If adopted, direct access would be suspended July 
1, 2001, except for written contracts executed prior to July 1, 2001.  On the 
PX Credit, he says that the cash payment is not required and leaves open the 
notion that the bill credit would continue.

The alternate decision by Commissioner Bilas does not suspend direct access 
but asks for ideas on how to provide DA given ABX 1 and the concerns of the 
state's Dept of Finance when providing comments on the draft decision.  Bilas 
has a finding of fact that "direct access is a necessary component of 
restoration of functional electricity markets." On the PX credit, Bilas' 
proposed decision would end the cash payment but begin a process to modify 
the PX credit decision (D.99-06-058) and to adopt a bottoms-up calculation 
for direct access customers.  He asks for comments in 20 days and reply 
comments in 5 days. With a bottoms-up calculation, direct access customers 
would pay only wires charges and public purpose charges and pay no charge for 
power purchases.

Comments on the draft decisiona are due next Monday, June 25.  

Enron and its coalitions will actively support the Bilas alternate and seek 
the third vote needed to ensure passage.
