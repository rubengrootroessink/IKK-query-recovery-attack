I am trying to find out if anybody knows anything about USI Corporation.  
They are a rate hawk out of San Juan Capistrano, CA. (So Cal).

They have approached Albertsons, who we are currently working with, about 
entering into an agreement with them.  They are promising a 15 - 20% savings 
($4-5MM) for their stores in SDG&E territory, just by putting them on another 
applicable utility rate that nobody is aware of  "loop hole".  Of course, 
they will not share this information until Albertsons has signed a contract.

The contacts we have been negotiating with have told them to get lost but USI 
went over their heads to senior management who is now asking for an 
explanation.

From a commodity origination and account management perspective a rate hawk, 
if hired, is just going to cause problems.

Any information that anybody can provide on:

1.  The Company
2.  There pitch in CA
3.  More specifically, their possible "loop hole or play" in SDG&E territory, 
would me much appreciated.

Please forward this message to anybody that might be able to help.

Is there an SDG&E interuptible tariff or a new ISO interuptible tariff that 
can generate this kind of savings?

Thanks,

George Waidelich
