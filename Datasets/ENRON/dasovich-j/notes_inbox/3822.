McKinsey & Co. has been engaged by the State of California to evaluate 
conditions in the gas market to California.  A Mckinsey representative, 
together with a CEC staffer, asked to interview TW next Wednesday, Mar 28 
(time TBD).  McKinsey forwarded the attached list of questions.  You'll see 
that they are very general & policy oriented.  I have taken a stab at filling 
in proposed answers.
