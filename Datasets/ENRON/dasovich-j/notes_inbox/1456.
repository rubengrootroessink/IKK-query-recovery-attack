Mary,
For two months now,   the Real Time traders at LADWP say that they either:

Cannot buy or sale anything due to political concerns

Or

Cannot sell for less than $225 due to political reasons.


They have not provided any detail behind this decision.    Other market 
participants,  such as SRP,  Pacificorp and APS  are aware of their policy.
We have heard that the price could be less if you are a utility buyer,  
however,   we have nothing to substantiate this information.
