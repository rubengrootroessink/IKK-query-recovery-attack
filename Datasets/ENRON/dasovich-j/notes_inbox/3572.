Let's go to dinner at this place my friend Stacy recommends (that is right
next to Sweetwater).  She lives there and I trust her food advice.  I am
trying to Molly and Sean to go also.  Then I will make reservations for 8.
How does that sound to you guys?

PP, thanks for the call with the info last week.

BTW, who's in the band besides Ed and Steve?

Cool!!!  It's at 8:30 on Thursday and you can call to reserve tickets if you
want (415-388-2820) but I am pretty sure it won't sell out.  They are a new
band, but a bunch of people we know that are really good.
I can't wait to see you!!  Is there a good place to go to dinner before hand
that you recommend?
