As I told Bob in an earlier email, I noticed this same provision. However,
it could be implemented in one of two ways.  Either finding that SCE is not
liable for negative CTC credits after that date, or holding that it is
liable and providing for cost recovery.  Either is consistent with the
language in the MOU.  We will need to explore this more, and possibly talk
to SCE.  Mike Day
