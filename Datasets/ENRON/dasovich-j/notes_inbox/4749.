Electricity Trading Builds Oh-So Slowly In France

PARIS -(Dow Jones)- Although electricity trading volumes are creeping higher 
in France, activity will probably remain subdued and irregular until a 
satisfactory regulatory regime is put in place. 
Traders complain about the uncertainty caused by the temporary rules of grid 
operator RTE, and about tariffs for access to the network. Volumes won't take 
off without well-designed, permanent rules, they said.
Even then Europe's second-largest electricity market may never become much of 
a trading hub because of the dominance of state utility Electricity de France 
(F.EDF) which, with its huge installed nuclear capacity, is already among 
Europe's cheapest electricity suppliers. 
"There's so much missing," said Katrin Durwald, an energy analyst with HEW 
Energy Trading, talking about RTE's tariffs and rules."Nothing is really 
clear in France," she said. 
Traders are especially upset over RTE's congestion costs, which only new 
market entrants share and which can add as much as 50% to the price of 
electricity. 
Other traders say access charges to the medium- to low-voltage network are 
impossible to figure out. But permanent tariffs won't go into effect until 
July 1 at the earliest, French electricity regulator CRE says. 
Permanent grid rules won't reach the regulator's desk for review until early 
summer, reckons RTE President Andre Merlin. 
Even with clearer regulation, the dominance of EDF will hold back the market. 
Former monopoly supplier EDF is a formidable competitor, a predominantly 
nuclear power producer with some of the lowest electricity prices in Europe. 
Traders estimate between 20 and 50 trades are going through monthly in 
France, mostly for electricity delivered the next day or next week. 
That's a far cry from neighboring Germany before the launch of spot 
electricity exchanges there, when 160 short-term transactions were struck 
daily, HEW Energy Trading estimates. 
More immediately, what's missing in France is a steady stream of one-year 
supply deals, a sign that foreign power companies are regularly furnishing 
electricity to French industrial consumers. 
"I seriously doubt whether there are companies taking risk and supplying 
customers," a trader with a large European power company said. 
French high-voltage grid operator RTE said 325 grid access contracts were 
signed this year for all transactions, as of March 12, equilavent to an 
average of four of five deals a day. 
There are, nonetheless, some pockets of activity in France. 
Traders are exchanging blocks of electricity to help industrial consumers 
curb costly imbalance charges, by grouping the companies' electricity needs 
to even out consumption patterns. 
RTE says 21 companies are authorized to furnish or buy back imbalance 
electricity. 
Swiss hydro producers are also exporting spot electricity to France, analysts 
said, notably Elektrizitaetsgesellschaft Laufenburg AG (Z.EGL) and 
Aare-Tessin AG fuer Elektrizitaet (Z.AAR). 
"Germany and France are the biggest export countries for Swiss spot hydro," 
Durwald said. 
At the same time, two Dutch energy distributors, NUON NV (N.NUN) and REMU NV, 
have been active in France, traders said. 
NUON purchased a few small hydroelectric producers, which are bound under an 
eight-year contract to sell electricity exclusively to EDF. 
But NUON can sell electricity to new customers above the contract price EDF 
is obliged to pay under its single buyer obligation, Durwald said. 
Some traders see opportunities cropping up this year from changes to the way 
transport capacity is allocated on France's interconnectors with the U.K. and 
with Italy. 
"Cogenerators (gas-fired power plants) in France with surplus capacity could 
sell to traders in Germany looking to import electricity into Italy," a 
trader at a large pan-European trading organization said. 
RTE forbids electricity ordered and delivered on the same day sourced from 
Germany and Switzerland to be imported to Italy. 
That trader also expects the daily transfer capacity auction on the 
U.K.-France Interconnector, which starts March 31, to spark more electricity 
trading in both countries. 
"The day-ahead risk is rather limited, not only in France but also in the 
U.K.," he said. 
The following are traders and power companies said to be active in France, in 
addition to those concerns already mentioned in the article, according to a

India: Dabhol guarantee: Govt awaiting Law Ministry view

Asia Intelligence Wire

NEW DELHI, March 22. THE Government is awaiting the opinion of the Law 
Ministry on the claim of the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) for the bill of Rs 
102 crore under the counter-guarantee cover, for the 740-MW Dabhol power 
project, before deciding on making the next payment to the utility. 
The Union Government has sought the opinion of the Law Ministry, as the 
Maharashtra Government had written to it, suggesting that the claim should 
not be honoured, as the DPC had not complied with load despatch instructions.
The Law Ministry's views are crucial to any decision on going in later for 
future course of action which could be either arbitration or High Court 
proceedings. 
The Government has sought an early response from the Law Ministry as the 
15-day interest free period for payment of DPCs's contentious bill for the 
month of December 2000 ends on Friday. 
According to the counter guarantee agreement, the Government will have to pay 
with interest (at Bank rate) the outstandings, if it is paid after 15 days of 
the receipt of the notice to the Government of India. 
The Government has one month's time from the date of presentation of the 
claim by the company to meet its obligations. 
Last time, the Maharashtra Government managed to make a payment to the MSEB 
in the nick of time, after DPC invoked the guarantee. 
This time the cause for conflict is the counter claim put forth by the 
Maharashtra Government seeking a rebate of Rs 400 crore from the power 
project sponsors. 
The conflict hinges on a technical issue involving legal interpretation of 
the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) between the Maharashtra State Electricity 
Board and project developers led by Enron. 
MSEB's contention is that the PPA requires Enron to make available power 
corresponding to 90 per cent 'Plant Availability' within a period of three 
hours of the requisition. 
On a particular day in January, Dabhol took five hours to achieve this task, 
according to the MSEB. Hence, MSEB has sought rebate as penalty for non 
compliance of despatch instructions. 
DPC, meanwhile, has contended that the despatch instructions were not in the 
format prescribed in the PPA.

India: Foreign companies facing tax harassment: Japanese envoy

Copyright (C) 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd (KSL); Source: World Reporter (TM) - 
Asia Intelligence Wire

CHENNAI, March 22. THE Japanese Ambassador in India, Mr Hiroshi Hirabayashi, 
today complained that there were "numerous instances" of foreign companies 
established in India, being harassed by tax officials. 
Delivering a speech at the Indo-Japan Centre here, Mr Hirabayashi that the 
tax collectors "seem to view foreign companies as an easy prey from whom they 
could collect as much as possible without being bothered by political 
pressure."
Out "of frustration and decreased chance of making profit, not a few Japanese 
companies have closed their businesses." 
Mr Hirabayashi said he had taken up the matter with the Finance Minister, Mr 
Yashwant Sinha, and had given the message that "tax officers are indeed 
killing the goose that lay golden eggs." 
In a particularly blunt speech, Mr Hirabayashi said one of the reasons why 
Japanese companies are hesitant to invest in India is because "what they hear 
is mostly sob-stories, stories of hardships faced by foreign investors." 
Foreign companies are carefully watching the development of Enron and 
Suzuki-Maruti ventures, for instance, he said. 
Japanese companies found East and South-East Asian countries more 
investor-friendly and preferred to invest there. 
The Ambassador cited two more reasons for poor Japanese investments in India: 
poor infrastructure and red- tapism. "While the single window system for 
foreign investment is set up, yet, when a foreign investor actually 
establishes a new venture, he has to use much nerve and money in obtaining 
plethora of clearances and permissions." 
Mr Hirabayashi was also critical of the investment climate in Maharashtra, 
where "foreign companies are constantly hammered by unlawful elements." 
On the other hand, he spoke warmly of Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra 
Pradesh, mentioning the names of the Chief Ministers by name. 
He said that he found in their attitude "perceptible changes for the better."

'Panel to clear Tannir Bhavi project deal'
The Times of India News Service

The Times of India
Copyright (C) 2001 The Times of India; Source: World Reporter (TM)

BANGALORE: The controversial Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) on the 410 MW 
Tannir Bhavi barge-mounted project will be submitted for approval to the 
Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission (KERC), Power Minister Veerakumar 
A. Patil told the Assembly on Thursday. 
Replying to the debate on the power tariff hike, Patil said: ``As soon as 
generation is started at Tannir Bhavi, the PPA will go to the KERC. All PPAs 
have to be cleared by the KERC before implementation.''
Earlier, A. Ramdas (BJP) alleged that the Karnataka Power Transmission 
Corporation (KPTC) had to pay a steep Rs 5.63 per unit for Tannir Bhavi power 
as per the terms of the PPA. 
``Even if we don't buy the power, we have to pay Rs 650 crore, in dollars, 
absorbing the differences in the price of naphta, as per the PPA. What is the 
government's vested interest in this project?'' he asked. 
Patil said the PPA, which includes escrow cover, had to be honoured following 
a direction from the Karnataka High Court. ``We are facing power shortage, 
specially at the height of summer, and are buying power from wherever 
possible. The KPTC Chairman and I are going to Delhi to see if we can get 
more power from the central grid,'' he added. 
Maharashtra had offered power at Rs 3.90 per unit from Enron. ``It is 
expensive, but if we have no alternative, we will buy power from them,'' he 
indicated. 
Referring to the bribery case in the 220 KV Kadra project, he seven of the 
eight accused had been arrested. ``Director (Distribution) Vijaybhaskar, 
however, has taken anticipatory bail,'' he added. 
Responding to Araga Jnanendra's (BJP) allegation that the government had 
handed over the Mavalagi project across Kali river to a independent power 
producer instead of the profit-making and government-owned Karnataka Power 
Corporation (KPC), Patil said: ``The KPC has taken a policy decision not to 
go for projects below 250 MW.'' 
The minister ruled out subsidies to sectors other than agriculture, for which 
the government has agreed to release Rs 144 crore to KPTC. ``There are review 
petitions from other sectors before the KERC, which will decide. But the 
government is not in a position to give any more money,'' he maintained.

USA: Transmission Texas' only dereg hurdle-state grid manager.
By C. Bryson Hull

03/22/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

HOUSTON, March 22 (Reuters) - Improving power transmission capacity is the 
biggest challenge Texas faces heading into deregulation next year, the 
manager of the state's power grid said on Thursday. 
California's Achilles' heel, a lack of generating capacity, is not Texas' 
problem, Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) chief executive 
officer Tom Noel said.
"Capacity is not the only issue. Serving this 200,000 square miles of 
territory and 6 million customers requires an awful lot of transmission, 
distribution and wire," Noel said in a speech at the Houston Energy Expo. 
"Also important are the constraints that exist." 
Currently, has 65,000 MW of generation and a 2000 peak summer load of around 
57,000 MW. Twenty-two new power plants have been built in Texas in the past 
five years, 15 are under construction and 30 are on the drawing board, he 
said. 
Moving that power from often remote plants to the biggest markets presents a 
challenge, particularly in four areas served by ERCOT, which manages 85 
percent of the Texas power grid. 
"You can't get it from there to here," Noel said of the trouble spots. 
Transmission constraints exist in moving power from the south to the north, 
where fast-growing Dallas creates a high demand; inside Dallas itself; from 
the Rio Grande Valley to Austin and San Antonio in Central Texas; and from 
lightly populated West Texas to the eastern half of the state. 
In the last case, several companies including Enron Corp. have committed to 
building wind power facilities out on the western plains, to supply power to 
the more densely populated eastern half of Texas. 
INCENTIVES TO BUILD TRANSMISSION 
Though companies have already anted up to erect power lines in the problem 
areas, the state will have to provide attractive rates of return to encourage 
continuing infrastructure investments, he said. 
"The rate of return is going to have to be a little higher than it was in the 
past," Noel said. 
He expected that the Texas Public Utility Commission, which negotiates such 
rates with the utilities, would look to a range of 10-12 percent return on 
investment, as opposed to current rates in the neighborhood of eight percent. 
Transmission is the only major part of the state's electricity market which 
will still be regulated after retail deregulation kicks off, he said. The 
wholesale market has been deregulated since 1995. 
"We believe the infrastructure has to be regulated," Noel said. 
"Part of our plan is to make sure that someone who owns the wires cannot 
become a market player and cut out people who have power to sell and can't 
get to market because they can't get to the lines," he said. 
Under the Texas deregulation plan, generators will sell power directly to 
customers but will send it via wires likely owned by other companies. That is 
part of the reason traditional regulated Texas utilities like TXU Corp. and 
Reliant Energy Inc. are splitting their regulated and unregulated businesses 
into separate entities. 
Noel said ERCOT and the state government are both committed to starting 
deregulation on schedule on Jan. 1, 2002. The first active move toward that 
end comes on April 2, when ERCOT will conduct a mock market. 
Noel acknowledged "it's not going to be pretty," because of some delays in 
setting up the computer hardware and software needed to undertake the testing 
prior to the start date. A pilot program for 5 percent of retail customers is 
next up on June 1.

Despite Talk, Bandwidth-Trading Cos Say They're Hiring
By Erwin Seba

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- While market-maker Enron Corp.'s (ENE) stock tumbled 
Wednesday on rumors that it plans to lay off people in its broadband unit, 
other bandwidth-trading companies said Thursday they have plans to add 
employees. 
Williams Communications Group (WCG), El Paso Corp. (EPG) and Aquila Broadband 
Services, a unit of Utilicorp United Inc. (UCU), said they are looking for 
some additions among traders and in other deal-making positions.
Additionally, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said the rumored layoffs are 
redeployments of some personnel within the company. 
"Redeployment is an everyday occurrence at Enron," Palmer said. "Our 
broadband business is growing and hitting its performance metrics as we laid 
them out in January." 
Enron Chief Executive Jeff Skilling is scheduled to have a telephone 
conference with investors at 1 p.m. EST Friday. Palmer said Skilling would 
discuss the bandwidth unit at that meeting. 
In a research report Thursday, Salomon Smith Barney reaffirmed its estimate 
of Enron's earnings and discounted the layoff rumors saying the redeployment 
was for noncommercial personnel. Palmer declined to comment on the Salomon 
Smith Barney report. 
At Aquila Broadband Services, Sushil Nelson expects to add two more traders 
to a staff of eight by the end of this year. 
The broadband unit has 36 employees, said Nelson, who serves as senior vice 
president and general manager. 
"We're looking to hire people with origination experience," he said. The 
company has 10 deal originators. Nelson declined to say how many deal 
originators the company plans to add by the end of the year. 
Williams Communications has five traders on its bandwidth desk. 
"As our business evolves, we certainly have room for more people," said Chris 
Lemmer, executive director of bandwidth trading and risk management at 
Williams Communications. 
A similar view was taken by Greg Jenkins, chief executive of El Paso Global 
Networks. 
"We are continuing with our strategy and adding commercial people to our 
organization," Jenkins said in a statement released by the company. "We 
believe this is a good moment to be building our business." 
Jenkins said the company plans to double its trading staff by the end of the 
year. He declined to say how many traders the company currently has.

USA: UPDATE 1-Bush accused of protecting oil firms in power crisis.
By Tom Doggett

03/22/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

WASHINGTON, March 22 (Reuters) - Washington Democratic Senator Patty Murray 
accused the Bush administration on Thursday of caring more about the 
financial interests of big oil companies than trying to protect consumers in 
Western states from the economic effects of high electricity prices and power 
supply shortages. 
"I think it is a real concern to all of us in my home state of Washington and 
the entire West Coast that we have been facing an energy crisis for four 
months now," Murray told reporters on Capitol Hill.
"I can only assume the influence of the oil industry in the Bush 
administration is keeping them from helping our economic crisis in the state 
of Washington," said Murray, adding that some of her constituents are facing 
a 60 percent surcharge in their electricity bills. 
Energy firms, many of them based in Bush's home state of Texas, supply 
natural gas and electricity to California's utilities. However, some 
suppliers have been reluctant to keep doing business with the nearly-bankrupt 
utilities. 
California's utilities have racked up billions in debts from skyrocketing 
electricity costs that the firms are prohibited from passing on to consumers 
under the state's deregulation law. 
Like President Bush, many of the energy firms oppose a price cap on wholesale 
electricity prices in the West as proposed by California Governor Gray Davis 
and other governors in the region. Bush fears a price cap would discourage 
energy firms from building new power plants. 
"A TOUGH-LUCK APPROACH" 
"We have an administration that has failed to come forward with a policy...to 
put in place an energy price cap immediately to begin to solve this problem," 
Murray said. "Unfortunately, this administration has advocated a tough-luck 
approach." 
Murray is co-sponsoring a Democratic energy bill unveiled on Thursday that 
includes language to limit the prices generating companies can charge for 
wholesale power in 11 western states. 
The White House defended the administration's policy against price curbs for 
electricity. "The reason why we oppose price caps is because they don't work, 
they would make the problem worse by driving away supply and failing to 
promote (energy) conservation," White House deputy press secretary Claire 
Buchan said on Thursday. 
Despite Murray's accusations of neglect by the president, Buchan said the 
administration cares how the energy crisis is affecting consumers in the 
West. 
"The president is very sympathetic to the concerns and anxiety of individuals 
in western states as they view the mounting energy issues in that area," she 
said. 
Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney were plagued with accusations during last 
year's campaign of being too cozy with big oil firms. 
The oil industry gave millions of dollars to Bush's presidential campaign and 
other Republican races throughout the country last year. 
Bush also depended on advice from executives of several energy firms, 
including natural gas giant Enron Corp. , in developing an energy policy for 
his new administration. 
Bush, a former Texas oilman, has named Vice President Dick Cheney, a former 
top executive of oilfield services giant Halliburton Co. to head a White 
House task force to come up with recommendations to solve America's energy 
problems that includes the West's power crisis.

USA: Enron stock slides despite earnings reassurance.
By Andrew Kelly

03/22/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

HOUSTON, March 22 (Reuters) - Shares of electricity and natural gas marketing 
giant Enron Corp. slid further on Thursday amid broader weakness in energy 
stocks despite a reassurance from the company that it would hit its 
previously stated earnings target for this year. 
Enron was off $3.34, or 6 percent, at $52.55 per share Thursday afternoon 
after falling 8 percent on Wednesday. So far this year, Enron's stock is down 
about 37 percent, versus a 16 percent decline for Standard & Poor's utilities 
index.
Seeking to reassure investors, Enron issued a statement on Thursday saying it 
was "very comfortable" with its 2001 earnings target of $1.70 to $1.75 per 
diluted share. On average, Wall Street analysts expect Enron to post earnings 
of $1.74 per share, according to data compiled by Thomson Financial/First 
Call. 
The Houston-based company said it was confident about its strong business 
prospects for the year, adding that it would host a conference call for 
analysts and investors on Friday. 
Analysts who track the company said the decline in its stock price did not 
appear to be related to business developments at Enron but rather to poor 
stock market sentiment, particularly in the areas of technology and 
telecommunications. 
"A lot of the breakout in Enron's stock in 2000 was in relation to their 
strategy in new areas like business-to-business and broadband 
telecommunications, and that's just out of favor right now," said CIBC World 
Markets analyst William Hyler. 
BUILDING A BROADBAND BUSINESS 
Since early last year Enron has been building a high-speed broadband 
communications network that it plans to use as a base to build a bandwidth 
marketing and trading business similar to its huge natural gas and 
electricity trading operation. 
Excitement among investors about the broadband business and about Enron's 
success in developing a strong Internet-based trading platform for energy and 
other commodities drove an 87 percent rise in the company's share price last 
year, outpacing a gain of 54 percent for the S&P utilities index. 
On Wednesday Enron spokesman Mark Palmer denied rumors of impending layoffs 
at the company's broadband unit, although he confirmed that staff were being 
redeployed within the business. 
Salomon Smith Barney analyst Ray Niles said in a research note that he was 
not concerned about the redeployments, nor about the recent cancellation of a 
deal with Blockbuster Inc. to deliver movies on-demand via Enron's broadband 
network. 
"We have always placed a greater value on the bandwidth trading portion of 
Enron's bandwidth strategy, rather than on content delivery," he said. Niles 
maintained a Buy rating on the company's stock and a 12-18 month price target 
of $100. 
Other U.S. energy stocks were also broadly weaker on Thursday, reflecting 
investor's concerns that a global economic slowdown could lead to reduced 
demand for energy and correspondingly lower prices for crude oil and natural 
gas. 
Williams Cos., a company with a business mix similar to Enron's, saw its 
stock decline $3.34, or 8 percent, to $38.10. 
Apache Corp., a leading U.S. oil and gas exploration company, was off $3.02, 
or 5 percent, at $57.20 while Halliburton Co., the world's biggest oilfield 
services company, was down $1.61, or over 4 percent, at $37.18.

STOCKWATCH Enron lower amid market deterioration after reaffirming guidance

03/22/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

NEW YORK (AFX) - Shares of Enron Corp were lower in late morning trade, 
falling 7.4 pct, pressured by the general share market deterioration as the 
company's reaffirmation of its earnings guidance failed to boost the stock, 
dealers said. 
At 11.37 am, the stock was down 4.14 usd at 51.75, as the DJIA traded down 
318.9 points at 9,168.09, and the Nasdaq composite down 31.78 at 1,798.45.
Dealers attributed the stock's failure to rally, despite its positive 
earnings news, to the market's rapid deterioration this week, noting 
extremely negative market breadth. 
On the NYSE, only 471 stocks were higher, 2,693 lower, and 195 stocks 
unchanged. 
Earlier today Enron reiterated its guidance that it expects its 2001 earnings 
per share to be 1.70-1.75 usd. The Thomson Financial/First Call 2001 EPS 
estimate for Enron is for 1.74 usd. 
Despite Enron's price declines yesterday and today, Salomon Smith Barney 
energy and commodities pricing analyst Raymond Niles said the falls were not 
justified by company fundamentals or recent concerns over its bandwidth unit. 
"Specifically, we are not at all concerned about non-commercial bank office 
deployments of personnel with the bandwidth group." 
"We remain confident that bandwidth trading, the key segment within Enron's 
bandwidth strategy, will show strong growth in the first quarter."

Enron `comfortable' with earnings estimates, but shares slide

HOUSTON (AP) - Enron Corp. assured investors Thursday it "remains very 
comfortable" with a previously announced 2001 earnings estimate of between 
$1.70 and $1.75 per share. 
According to First Call/Thomson Financial, the consensus estimate of 2001 
earnings among industry analysts $1.74 per share.
In a brief news release, the Houston-based energy giant also said it would 
bring investors up to date with a conference call on Friday, which will be

Energy Researcher Says California Not Fixing Power Problems

     (For more stories on the California energy crisis, see
{EXTR <GO>}.)

     Washington, March 22 (Bloomberg) -- The director of energy
consultant Cambridge Energy Research Associates told the U.S.
Congress that California's actions to address its energy crisis
won't increase power supplies and could harm the state's finances.
     California should accelerate power-plant construction to add
supply and remove consumer-rate controls to damp electricity
demand, Lawrence Makovich, Cambridge Energy's senior director, said
in printed testimony for the U.S. House of Representatives
subcommittee on energy and air quality. The state also should avoid
signing long-term supply contracts with high fixed prices, he said.
     California has spent more than $3.2 billion this year buying
electricity for its nearly insolvent investor-owned utilities,
which have been forced to buy power on the open market for more
than they can charge consumers under a 1996 state deregulation law.
With demand heavy and affordable wholesale power scarce, California
has endured rolling blackouts this week and in January.
     ``If this crisis drives California back to the heavy-handed
regulation that launched deregulation in the first place, or to an
expansive public power authority, then the state is likely to find
its electric sector becoming increasingly inefficient and
expensive,'' Makovich's testimony said.
     The state is attempting to buy the transmission lines of
California's three largest utilities, PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas &
Electric, Edison International's Southern California Edison and
Sempra Energy's San Diego Gas & Electric, to provide the utilities
with funds.
     The state faces years of high energy payments by signing long-
term energy contracts with companies such as Calpine Corp., Enron
Corp., and Duke Energy Corp. during a shortage, Makovich said.
California could discourage investment needed to build new power
plants by an attempt to gain ownership of much of California's
electricity grid, he added.
     California has an energy shortage because no significant power
plants were built in the state in the last decade, even as demand
skyrocketed. Drier-than-normal weather has also reduced electricity
supplies from hydroelectric plants in the northwestern U.S.

Enron Reaffirms 2001 Forecast After Stock Price Falls (Update1)

Enron Reaffirms 2001 Forecast After Stock Price Falls (Update1)

     (Updates percentage decline in first paragraph and closes
shares.)

     Houston, March 22 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., whose shares
have fallen 17 percent in the past week on concern the company's
telecommunications business won't generate the expected profit,
said it still expects to earn $1.70 to $1.75 a share this year.
     The largest energy trader raised its 2001 profit estimate in
January, citing growth in European and North American trading and
more business from its fiber-optic network. It previously forecast
profit of $1.60 to $1.70 a share.
     Enron's shares fell 11 percent on March 12 after the collapse
of an agreement for Blockbuster Inc. to deliver movies on demand
over Enron's fiber-optic system. The shares continued to fall this
week, partly on speculation Enron may exit the broadband business,
Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Curt Launer said in a report.
     ``The market is panicked to a certain extent,'' said Dain
Rauscher Wessels analyst Mark Easterbrook, who has a ``strong
buy'' rating on Enron shares.
     Shares of Houston-based Enron fell 87 cents to $55.02 after
touching a 52-week low of $51.51 earlier.
     ``Broadband is a core business of Enron's,'' spokesman Vance
Meyer said. ``All of our businesses are doing very well, and we
plan to hit our earnings targets, and that includes broadband.''
     Investors also are concerned that falling natural-gas prices
and California's energy crisis may hurt Enron's trading business,
analysts said. Enron also has failed to get the Indian government-
owned Maharashtra State Electricity Board to pay its December
power bill.
     Easterbrook said he expects the shares to rebound once Enron
reports first-quarter earnings on April 17.
     ``The stock may act weak here, it may continue to act weak
for the next several days,'' he said. ``But I think first-quarter
earnings will be a pretty good catalyst.''
     The company is expected to earn 44 cents a share in the first
quarter, the average estimate of analysts surveyed by First
Call/Thomson Financial. It earned $338 million, or 40 cents, a
year earlier.

(Enron has scheduled a conference call for tomorrow at 1 p.m. New
York time ``to provide investors with a general update on the
company,'' it said. A live Webcast of the call will be available
through the Investors section of http://www.enron.com.)

Enron Corp.'s India Unit Faces $88.2 Mln Penalty, Paper Says
2001-03-22 23:04 (New York)


     New Delhi, March 23 (Bloomberg) -- Dabhol Power Co., Enron
Corp.'s India unit, has been asked by Maharashtra state to pay a
fine of 4.12 billion rupees ($88.2 million) for not generating at
full capacity within three hours of being asked to do so, the
Economic Times reported, without citing sources.
     The move is part of a tussle between the two sides over dues.
Earlier this month, Dabhol said it had asked the federal
government to pay a 1.02 million-rupee power bill run up by the
Maharashtra State Electricity Board, or MSEB, for December.
     The government of Maharashtra, the western Indian state where
Dabhol is located, last month had to pay $17 million as its
November dues after the company invoked a federal government
guarantee.
     The Maharashtra government asked the federal government not
to pay the bill for December and instead offset it against the
penalty, the report said.
     Dabhol didn't respond to requests in time in the last three
months of 2000, the paper reported. The federal government is
expected to decide on the issue in a day or two, the paper said.
