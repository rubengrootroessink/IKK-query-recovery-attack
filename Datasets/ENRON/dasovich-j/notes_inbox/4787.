I spoke with ABAG attorney Kenneth Moy and APS attorney Dan Douglas.
Neither was thrilled with the Wood/Barnett draw, but neither was immediately
warm to the notion of a negotiated continuance.  I outlined the arguments
against charging into the guns of Wood and Barnett, and reminded them that
there could very likely be delays anyway as a result of the CPUC's continued
indecision about the end of the rate freeze--which looks to be increasing as
a result of the Administration's deadlock with the utilities.  They both
indicated that they would discuss the matter with their clients and get back
to us shortly.  I suspect at least one of them will say "no we want to go
ahead even if you do not."  As soon as I hear from them, I will contact SCE
and PG&E.  Mike Day
