RE:???????? Friday, May 4 meeting at 1:30 pm in the CMTA conference room to 
discuss Windfall Profits Tax bills 

Due to a scheduling conflict, we are changing our Thursday, 2:00 pm meeting 
to Friday, May 4 at 1:30 pm. 

As most of you are aware, CMTA is opposing legislation designed to impose a 
Windfall Profits Tax on electricity generator 
companies.? The bills are SBX1 1 (Soto) and ABX1 128 (Corbett).? Please note 
that the Soto bill pertains to co-generators as 
well as entities exclusively in the power business.? That means that many of 
you would be directly effected.? The other primary 
basis for opposition is that the bills would inhibit electrical supply.? 
Please also note that, to the extent that SBX1 1 (Soto) were 
operative, it would impose the "windfall cost" on business taxpayers who 
would fund the credit given to personal income tax 
taxpayers. 

You are invited to our lobbying strategy meeting which will be here at CMTA's 
offices at 980 9th Street, Suite 2200 
on Friday, May 4 at 1:30 pm.? Please RSVP to Pam Ross at 916-498-3320 or 
pross@cmta.net. 

There is a call in number as follows:
