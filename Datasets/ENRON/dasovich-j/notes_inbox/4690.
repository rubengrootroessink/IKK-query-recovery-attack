Chambers speak at an event hosted by the Haas School on April 11 at
Zellerbach Hall. The event will be taped for the PBS television series CEO
Exchange.

The show will be introduced by Dean Laura Tyson and moderated by CNN's Jeff
Greenfield. Students will have a opportunity to ask the CEOs questions at
the end of the program. A raffle and a reception will follow the taping of
the show.

The event is free and open to all Haas students. Tickets are required and

AT Kearney, the exclusive sponsor of CEO Exchange, will raffle off two Pen
Cam Trios by AIPTEK to the students at the end of the taping. The Pen Cam
is a three-in-one camera: it's a PC camera, a digital camera, and a digital
camcorder. You can view it at http://www.aiptek.com/Products_PenCam-Trio.htm.

HOLD ON TO YOUR TICKETS! You will need them for admission to the show, for
the raffle, and for admission to the catered reception with the speakers
and special guests that takes place after the show at the new Haas Pavilion.
