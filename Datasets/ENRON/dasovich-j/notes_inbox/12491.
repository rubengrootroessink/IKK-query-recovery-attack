Subject: Re: ANALYSIS OF CALIFORNIA  

In particular, would be nice to know how much of the "wealth transfer" went 
to the likes of LADWP, other CA munis, Calpine, and the federal government 
(e.g., BPA, Salt River).  Finally, how much did the utilities profit from the 
high prices (i.e., from selling their excess gen into the PX)?  

Best,
Jeff

Seabron - 

Here is an outline of the work product we would like you to consider --

1. How much did the LACK OF POLITICAL LEADERSHIP / LUNACY cost California 
consumers?
 + LUNACY = CPUC did not accept $60/Mwh last year 
 + unwillingness to fix credit problems
 + Bad CDWR buying habits
 + other

2. Analyze key Cal ISO studies dealing with "overearning" and market abuse.
 + Methodological faults
 + Analyze Key Findings
 + Develop appropriate "Enron" responses

3. Develop framework to assist in responding to political "calls" for market 
controls
 + Understand better who "won" from the WEALTH TRANSFER
 + How much was transferred to "Texas generators"?

4. Other fixes still needed
 + A/S markets in California
 + Governance issues
 + other?

I hope this helps frame the work.

Jim
