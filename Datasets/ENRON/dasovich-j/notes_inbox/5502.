Prentice told me last night that you were very busy, so I took care of
making the reservation on Alaska Airlines and paying for the fare.  When you
get a chance, just send me the $545 minus my share of the rental car we
picked up at Burbank and anything else we might owe.  When are we going out
for a practice round?
