Here it is.  To explain, I left the sheet you saw previously as Sheet 1.  
Sheet 2 is the new employee and business expense budget.  It shows 
expenditures through 7/09/01 in the first column, our 2001 budget in the 
second column, and a proposed 2002 budget in the third column.  Some of the 
expenditures are kind of kooky -- because of miscoding or other reasons.  For 
example, payments to IEP appear under "Employee Pers --Other" and "Outside 
Serv - Prof".  There are many examples of kooky things -- so don't worry 
about it. 

We ended up getting charged for things this year that we didn't put in our 
budget, such as AT&T calling cards and Edith's time -- so I've tried to 
include all the items -- even if I put them in another category (for example, 
I don't use the category "EIS Allocation" in our budget). I included those 
wacky categories that we don't use in our budget at the bottom of column 1 
just to get the correct total for the year to date.  

Sheet 3 is outside expenses such as contributions, retainers and 
memberships.  Column 1 shows our 2001 budget and column 3 shows our projected 
2002 budget. I added some dollars to the retainers to cover some minimal 
expenses that we get charged.  Other than that, it's pretty much what we 
discussed last week. 

Have fun, Paul!  Call with any questions.
