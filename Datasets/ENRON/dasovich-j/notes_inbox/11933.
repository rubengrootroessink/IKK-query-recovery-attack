FYI-

The attached ruling denies PG&E's motion to combine the issues surrounding
the DWR revenue requirement and revenue allocation with the utility retained
generation proceeding.  The ruling, however, sets an alternative schedule
for separate consideration of the DWR revenue requirement and allocation
issues as they relate to PG&E and SCE (not SDG&E).  The commission has
requested more information from DWR on the revenue requirement it submitted
on May 2nd and upon receipt of that information will give parties the
opportunity to review it and file comments.
