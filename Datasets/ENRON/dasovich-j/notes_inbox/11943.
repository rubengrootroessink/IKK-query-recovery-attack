 Lawmakers vow a vote on Edison=20

Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published July 13, 2001)=20
Facing a looming deadline and pressure from the governor, legislative leade=

said Thursday they will push for a vote next week on a revised plan to save=

Southern California Edison from bankruptcy court.=20
Under competing proposals from each house of the state Legislature, large=
=20
businesses would pay for the majority of Edison's $3.5 billion debt and pow=
er=20
generators would be pressed to accept less than they are owed for past ener=
gy=20
purchases.=20
A vote next week would come three months after Gov. Gray Davis first struck=
=20
an agreement with Edison. His original arrangement would have the state=20
purchase the company's transmission lines for $2.76 billion and use a porti=
on=20
of consumer rates to help pay off Edison's debt.=20
But lawmakers roundly criticized the Democratic governor's agreement in=20
subsequent weeks and floated alternatives soon afterward. Lawmakers=20
acknowledged that the latest alternatives are still under negotiation.=20
The governor's agreement with Edison has an Aug. 15 deadline, which falls=
=20
toward the end of the Legislature's summer recess. Because the monthlong=20
break is scheduled to begin next Friday, lawmakers plan to vote before then=

The Assembly could vote on a proposal as early as Saturday.=20
Davis on Tuesday threatened to call a special session to keep legislators i=

Sacramento if they do not approve the Edison plan before the break. But=20
Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco, challenged that=20
threat, saying, "Only the Legislature can keep the Legislature here."=20
Senate Democrats are studying a plan by Sen. Byron Sher, D-Palo Alto, that=
=20
would have large businesses pay off most of Edison's debt and force=20
generators to reduce by 30 percent the amount they are owed by the utility.=
=20
That would leave about $1.2 billion in debt, for which Edison itself would =
be=20
responsible without relying on ratepayers, Sher said.=20
His plan also gives the state the option to purchase Edison's transmission=
=20
lines for book value -- less than half the price Davis offered to pay.=20
Burton said his house will vote on a version of Sher's proposal next week.=
=20
Burton said he prefers Sher's version because large businesses and industri=
al=20
users, not consumers or small businesses, would be responsible for paying t=
he=20
majority of Edison's debt. He reiterated that businesses were among the mos=
t=20
ardent advocates for electricity deregulation.=20
"We're trying to do something legislatively that protects the people and=20
isn't a bailout for the utility," Burton said. "I don't think it's fair tha=
t=20
small users pay for any of (the debt)."=20
While the Senate toils over Sher's proposals, members of the Assembly are=
=20
drafting their own version of a plan. Their version, too, would separate=20
users into large and small categories, according to Paul Hefner, a spokesma=
n=20
for Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Sherman Oaks.=20
Under the plan, electricity for small users -- some residential and=20
small-business customers -- would come from the cheapest sources -- Edison'=
s=20
own power plants and renewable energy sources known as "qualifying=20
facilities." Larger users would pay more because they would obtain power fr=

the open market, presumably at lower prices.=20

State lawmakers lobby for refund on energy purchases
By Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writer
(Published July 13, 2001)=20
Thwarted in their quest for an $8.9 billion refund from wholesale power=20
suppliers, state officials began applying political pressure Thursday on=20
federal regulators who will set refund levels.=20
A month after pressure from Congress prompted the Federal Energy Regulatory=
=20
Commission to accept price controls on electricity, House Democrats from=20
California urged FERC to support Gov. Gray Davis' refund demands.=20
"The congressional delegation is doing all it can," Rep. Sam Farr, head of=
=20
the state's Democratic delegation, told reporters during a conference call=
=20
with Davis. Farr called $8.9 billion a reasonable refund.=20
Recommending a more lenient standard for calculating refunds, the Democrats=
=20
said in a letter that FERC should order refunds for power sales dating back=
=20
to May 1, 2000. FERC, however, has ruled previously that it cut off the=20
refund period at Oct. 2.=20
The state says about one-third of the alleged overcharges, or nearly $3=20
billion, took place between May and October.=20
Meanwhile, a FERC administrative law judge reiterated his belief that the=
=20
refunds would total "hundreds of millions of dollars, probably more than a=
=20
billion dollars," but less than the $8.9 billion California says it was=20
overcharged.=20
Judge Curtis Wagner, who oversaw two weeks of negotiations between Californ=
ia=20
and the suppliers, said "the amount claimed by the State of California has=
=20
not and cannot be substantiated." In a report to FERC commissioners, he=20
repeated his earlier comment that the state owes more to the suppliers for=
=20
unpaid power bills than the suppliers owe the state for overcharges.=20
On Thursday, Wagner formally recommended that FERC hold a public hearing to=
=20
calculate the overcharges.=20
In setting the guidelines for figuring out refunds, Wagner said the=20
calculations should be tied to production costs, a guideline urged by=20
California's negotiators. But the judge included a guideline likely to favo=
r=20
the sellers: For sales taking place after Jan. 5, 2001, the sellers can add=
=20
10 percent to their cost calculations as a risk premium.=20
That was the date Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edis=

were placed on junk bond status by Wall Street credit-rating agencies, maki=
ng=20
sellers reluctant to deliver power to the two utilities. The state stepped =
in=20
two weeks later to buy power for PG&E and Edison.=20
Davis, speaking to reporters before Wagner's recommendation, said the judge=
's=20
cost formulas would help California prove his case. "The number comes up=20
close to $8.9 billion," he said.=20
But the governor, who has threatened to sue FERC if he didn't get $8.9=20
billion, suggested he'll need political help from Congress to get his way=
=20
with FERC.=20
It is widely believed that political pressure made FERC abandon its=20

Curtis L. Wagner Jr., in a recommendation released Thursday, said that whil=

Gov. Gray Davis and California officials who attended the 15-day talks held=

cannot be substantiated.  "That very large refunds are due is clear," Wagne=

wrote, likely amounting to "hundreds of million of dollars, probably more=

said in a statement. "Now the day of reckoning for the new FERC has come. I=

would like to believe the commission, with two new commissioners, will be=

differences between what the state wants and what the sellers believe they=

The refund order should reach back until at least July, he said, when energ=

In calculating costs, the judge recommends using the "heat rate" for the=20
least efficient plant that sold power into the California market on each da=

That plant's costs to produce power will be the basis for setting a benchma=

THE ENERGY CRISIS
Options Debated in Edison Rescue
Energy: Legislature is still sharply split over Davis' plan. Some want to l=

TIMES STAFF WRITER

July 13 2001

SACRAMENTO -- A week before its annual summer recess, the California=20
Legislature remains deeply divided over Gov. Gray Davis' plan to rescue=20
Southern California Edison from financial ruin--and a growing number of=20
lawmakers are proposing to let the state's second largest utility fall into=
=20
bankruptcy.

Convinced that Davis' plan is political suicide, leading Democrats in the=
=20
Assembly and Senate on Thursday advanced slimmed-down alternatives to save=
=20
Edison.

"The fact of the matter is that we just have to act," said Assembly Speaker=
=20
Bob Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks), who introduced an alternative plan to rescu=
e=20
Edison Thursday afternoon and scheduled hearings on it throughout the=20
weekend. At issue are competing priorities with important ramifications.=20
Advocates of the rescue say it is needed to keep the utility solvent and=20
prevent California from descending further into its long-running energy=20
crisis. Critics say it is politically impossible to sell a bailout for the=
=20
utility and argue that bankruptcy may be a better solution.

In recent days, those critics have appeared to be gaining ground. Lawmakers=
=20
conceded Thursday that none of the counterproposals to Davis' bailout plan=
=20
appears to have sufficient support to clear both houses--and none has the=
=20
blessing of the utility, which contends that only the original Davis versio=
n=20
would make it credit-worthy.

In fact, some lawmakers and lobbyists working on the Edison deal contend th=
e=20
sudden legislative push is a political exercise designed to deflect critici=
sm=20
and provide cover in case the company goes under.

California is spending billions to buy about a third of the electricity=20
needed to serve the state because its two largest utilities, Edison and=20
Pacific Gas & Electric, are too burdened with debt to do so. That dilemma c=
an=20
end only when the utilities are able to resume their role as procurers of=
=20
power.

PG&E opted to take itself into Bankruptcy Court in April rather than wait f=
or=20
a political solution to its financial problem, but Edison reached a sweepin=
g=20
deal with Davis later that month. That plan has languished in the Legislatu=
re=20
ever since.

The agreement calls for California to purchase Edison's power transmission=
=20
grid for $2.76 billion. In turn, the company would use the money to retire=
=20
some of the $3.5 billion in debt it racked up between May 2000 and January=
=20
2001, when it bought billions of dollars' worth of electricity in the=20
wholesale power market but could not recover those costs from customers=20
protected by a state utility rate freeze.

As a result of the state assistance, Edison would resume buying electricity=
=20
for the 11 million people it serves in January 2003. If the Legislature doe=
s=20
not approve the deal, Davis argues, the state will be left in the business =
of=20
buying that power for far longer.

But angry consumer groups are threatening to derail any rescue deal with an=
=20
initiative campaign, calling such proposals massive government bailouts. An=
d=20
some leery lawmakers are convinced that Bankruptcy Court would provide a=20
better forum for resolving Edison's unwieldy problem.

"Tell me why bankruptcy is any worse than any other proposal," said state=
=20
Sen. Mike Machado (D-Linden), echoing a view he said was shared by many of=
=20
his colleagues.

"PG&E," he added, "seems to be doing quite well."

In recent weeks, said state Sen. Ross Johnson (R-Irvine), he has received a=
=20
series of letters from constituents with a penny attached--the amount they=
=20
said they were willing to contribute to a rescue of Edison.

"PG&E declared bankruptcy months ago," Johnson said, "and contrary to=20
prevailing notions, the world did not come to an end."

The tentative rescue deal Davis reached with Edison allows the utility to=
=20
back out of the agreement if the Legislature does not approve it by Aug.=20
15--a deadline lawmakers will almost certainly miss unless they strike a de=
al=20
before they recess.

Edison Officials Voice Optimism

Edison officials remain optimistic, however, that lawmakers will soon fashi=
on=20
an agreement. Davis threatened this week to haul legislators into a special=
=20
session on Edison's woes later this month if they fail to forge a compromis=
e,=20
a tactic that encouraged representatives of the utility.

"We're feeling better about the likelihood of having this be resolved in=20
time," said Edison spokesman Brian Bennett.

The Edison deal is among many interrelated facets of Davis' efforts to end=
=20
the energy crisis and escape with a working electricity market in Californi=
a.=20
As such, it is a complicated proposal.

Indeed, even some of the basics are hard to discern. For one thing, the=20
continuing debate in Washington over whether California is owed billions in=
=20
refunds for overcharges by power generators makes it difficult for lawmaker=
s=20
even to be sure how big Edison's debt truly is.

California leaders had hoped a mediator would find common ground between th=
e=20
state and energy companies, but those talks broke down earlier this month.=
=20
The refund dispute now moves to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission--a=
nd=20
possibly to the courts, where it could take years to resolve.

"Now we have to act, not knowing what the outcome of that process will be,"=
=20
said Assemblyman Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek), one of the legislators=20
working to craft an Edison deal.

Then there is the $43 billion in long-term power contracts that Davis signe=
d=20
with energy companies this year in hopes of stabilizing supplies for years =
to=20
come.

Many lawmakers are convinced that those contracts, which are to be paid off=
=20
over the next 15 years by utility consumers, will leave less money for the=
=20
utilities to regain their financial footing. That would probably force the=
=20
state to raise electric rates again in coming months.

That, in turn, would make it more politically difficult for lawmakers to=20
approve the Edison deal, which calls for utility ratepayers to retire the=
=20
company's $3.5-billion under-collection through a special surcharge on thei=
r=20
bills.

"One of the major problems is those long-term contracts," said Assemblyman=
=20
Keith Richman (R-Northridge), who is leading the GOP's efforts to cut an=20
Edison deal in the Assembly. "These contracts are going to burden the=20
ratepayers for generations, and appear to be a major impediment to a soluti=
on=20
with Edison."

Moreover, many lawmakers want to ensure as part of the Edison deal that at=
=20
least the largest business consumers maintain the right to shop around for=
=20
the cheapest power providers--one of the main selling points of California'=
s=20
1996 experiment in electricity deregulation.

While businesses have been demanding the so-called direct access, lawmakers=
=20
and some consumer groups have voiced concern. They say droves of businesses=
=20
will flee the utilities for better deals than the governor's long-term=20
contracts provide--leaving residential customers in the lurch.

Amid all these obstacles, a team of Senate Democrats has been huddling with=
=20
representatives of the Davis administration for the last two days, working =
on=20
a new version of the Edison agreement.

A draft being discussed Thursday evening would abandon the controversial pl=
an=20
to purchase the utility's transmission grid, whose value has been questione=
d.=20
Also, it would not give Edison any help in erasing the roughly $1 billion i=
t=20
owes power plant owners, leaving the utility to try to get that debt=20
eliminated in the federal fight with the generators.

Instead, the new agreement would only help Edison shrink the $2.5 billion i=
n=20
debt it owes to banks and smaller, alternative energy producers. Large powe=
r=20
customers would bear the burden of the costs.

"These guys are going to come up with something," said Senate President Pro=

Rival Proposal Is Unveiled

In the Assembly, meanwhile, a team of lawmakers Thursday unveiled a rival=

Edison proposal that would also attempt to shield homeowners and smaller=20

To do so, it would force industrial consumers to pay the utility's=20
debts--including a portion of the amount owed generators--in exchange for=

allowing big consumers the chance to negotiate their own power deals on the=

Developer Pulls Plug on Power Plant in Chula Vista
Electricity: A San Diego company cancels plans to build a controversial=20

MITCHELL LANDSBERG
TIMES STAFF WRITER

July 13 2001

A San Diego company has canceled plans to build a controversial power plant=
=20
in Chula Vista, angrily blaming state officials for failing to guarantee th=
at=20
the plant would turn a profit.

The announcement from Ramco Inc., made public Thursday, is the latest setba=
ck=20
to Gov. Gray Davis' campaign to get more electricity on line this summer. B=
ut=20
one state official characterized the decision as evidence that California i=
s=20
now dealing with power companies from a position of strength, and can affor=
d=20
to turn down projects if the price isn't right.

"That's the exact position California wants to be in, frankly, where we can=
=20
negotiate and, if we need to, walk away from the table," said Oscar Hidalgo=
,=20
a spokesman for the state Department of Water Resources. "So we'll move on =
to=20
other, more willing participants." Ramco apparently gave up after failing t=
o=20
strike a deal with the department for energy from the proposed plant, which=
=20
would have been near a community recreation center and elementary school in=
=20
Chula Vista, a city of 173,000 in southwestern San Diego County.

The plant would have provided 62 megawatts of "peaking" power, which is=20
primarily intended for use during periods of heaviest electricity use.=20
Sixty-two megawatts is enough to serve about 50,000 homes.

The developer's announcement follows the decision of another San Diego=20
company to withdraw plans for a plant in the Baldwin Hills area of Los=20
Angeles, also in the face of community opposition. State officials conceded=
=20
earlier this week that several other power plant projects appear to be behi=
nd=20
schedule.

Chula Vista Opposed Ramco Power Plant

The Chula Vista City Council had opposed the Ramco project, which would hav=
e=20
been built next to another new power plant in a highly urbanized area that =
is=20
a jumble of industry, residences and other uses. The first plant began=20
operating around July 1.

City officials had complained that the proposed plant would run initially=
=20
without advanced pollution control devices, and, together with other new an=
d=20
proposed plants in the area, would have a disproportionate impact on a poor=
,=20
predominantly Latino population. Some community activists opposed the plant=
=20
on similar grounds.

Despite the opposition, the Energy Commission approved the plant's license =
on=20
June 13.

The company did not mention community opposition in its letter to the=20
commission, and Ramco officials did not return telephone calls seeking=20
comment Thursday. Opponents reacted with relief that the plans were being=
=20
scrapped.

"We're thrilled," said Michael Meacham, special operations manager for the=
=20
city of Chula Vista. "Regardless of the reason for withdrawal, we're happy=
=20
about it."

Josie Lopez-Calderon, president of San Diego's Mexican American Business an=
d=20
Professional Assn. and a leading opponent of the plant, was similarly=20
pleased, and said the community opposition had led to the company's=20
withdrawal.

"I think if it was solely for the reasons they've given, all the other peak=
er=20
plants would be pulling out, and I don't see that happening," she said. "So=
 I=20
think our concerns might have had some effect."

Robert Laurie, the state energy commissioner to whom the company's letter w=
as=20
addressed, said that he was not sure he understood the company's rationale,=
=20
but that it seemed clear that Ramco was unhappy with the Department of Wate=
r=20
Resources. Since last winter, when the state's large investor-owned utiliti=
es=20
became unable to pay for their own energy purchases, the agency has been=20
buying most of the state's electricity.

"To me, it called into question what the policies of DWR were," Laurie said=
.=20
"Are they seeking to add power or are they not seeking to add power?"

In his letter, Ramco President Richard McCormack wrote that the company had=
=20
been optimistic that the department would "provide the credit support" for=
=20
the company to supply power to the Independent System Operator, which runs=
=20
the statewide electrical transmission grid. "Unfortunately," he said, the=
=20
department had "specifically rejected such support."

Officials at Cal-ISO and the department said they didn't understand=20
McCormack's comments.

Ramco Couldn't Foresee 'a Reasonable Return'

The letter also said that Ramco needed to expect "a reasonable return on it=
s=20
investment while dealing with a credit-worthy entity in an environment wher=
e=20
the sanctity of contract exists. There is simply no evidence that we can se=
e,=20
even on the horizon, that would suggest conditions will improve to the poin=
t=20
where Ramco could once again consider investing in new power plants in=20
California."

Hidalgo, the department spokesman, said the agency still intends to sign=20
contracts with energy providers, and is willing to continue talks with Ramc=
o,=20
but can now afford to be pickier than it was earlier this year, when it was=
=20
criticized for signing more than $40 billion in long-term contracts at rate=
s=20
that some considered exorbitant.

Gary Ackerman, a spokesman for the Western Power Trading Forum, an=20
organization of power traders and generators, said he didn't understand why=
=20
Ramco's failure to sign a contract with the department would doom the=20
project. After all, he said, the agency is not the only buyer of electricit=
y.

"You could take market risk and build that plant," he said. Abandoning it=
=20
"doesn't make any sense." He said he knew of no other energy generator=20
contemplating a similar pullout.

Rob Schlichting, a spokesman for the Energy Commission, noted that Ramco=20
could still build the plant. Under the terms of its license, the plant woul=

THE ENERGY CRISIS
Some State Energy Consultants Own Generators' Stock
Ethics: They negotiate deals and buy electricity from power firms. GOP=20

July 13 2001

SACRAMENTO -- More than half a dozen consultants hired by the state to=20

during California's energy crisis.

The potential conflict of interest emerged Thursday with the release of=20
financial disclosure statements by consultants who have been hired by the=
=20
state since the start of the power crunch.

Among those disclosing stock ownership were two key negotiators of long-ter=

Several other consultants who played key roles in the state's energy effort=

under state law.

Among those who did not file the financial disclosure statements were a pai=

of executives at two Wall Street firms that stand to make $14 million if th=
e=20
state buys California's power grid. Of about 50 consultants hired by the=20
state in the past six months, 27 filed the disclosures.

The disclosures follow a firestorm in Sacramento last month over the hiring=
=20
by Gov. Gray Davis of two media consultants also employed by Southern=20
California Edison, the troubled utility that is negotiating with the state=
=20
over a bailout package.

Steve Maviglio, a Davis spokesman, said the governor's legal staff was=20
reviewing the financial disclosure forms for any potential conflicts of=20
interest.

"If there's anything inappropriate," Maviglio said, "then we'll deal with i=
t."

Republicans, however, said the hired workers had revealed overt conflicts=
=20
that clearly violated state law.

Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican running for governor against=20
Davis next year, said the revelations call into question the work performed=
=20
by the consultants on high-priced energy contracts that are "going to=20
mortgage our children's future for decades to come."

"If you show a conflict, the potential is there for collusion," Jones said.=
=20
"I'm not accusing anyone, but that's why you have disclosure."

Rob Stutzman, a state GOP spokesman, said he was particularly troubled=20
because the consultants had delayed filing the disclosure forms for months.=
=20
Under state law, the forms are supposed to be submitted within 30 days afte=
r=20
the consultants go to work for the state.

Most of the energy consultants, who could not be reached for comment,=20
reported owning relatively small amounts of stock in energy firms, generall=
y=20
less than $10,000.

But one of the new workers, William Mead, disclosed that he owned between=
=20
$100,000 and$1 million in Calpine, a San Jose-based energy firm. Mead did n=

Only one of the contractors reported selling off stock after coming to work=

for the state.

Vikram Budhraja, president of Pasadena-based Electric Power Group LLC, on=

Jan. 11 purchased between $10,000 and $100,000 in stock of Dynegy, a=20
electricity and natural gas producer. He sold it off on Jan. 29, 10 days=20
after he came to work for the state. Budhraja has been a top negotiator of=

the state's long-term energy contracts, which have included a deal conclude=
d=20
March 2 with Dynegy.

Richard Ferreira, a retired Sacramento Utility District executive hired by=

Bernard Barretto, an energy trader, reported that he owned an undisclosed=

$100,000 in Calpine stock.

Republicans took credit for forcing the Davis administration to file the=20
reports, a charge the governor's office brushed aside.

Jones, the secretary of state, held a news conference Tuesday to complain=

about the failure of nearly all the state's energy consultants to file any=

late in the afternoon Thursday, months after many consultants went to work=

THE ENERGY CRISIS
Plan Uses Public in Refund Demand
Legislature: Democrats' proposal to pressure 'greedy' firms is attacked by=
=20
GOP as political ploy.
CARL INGRAM
TIMES STAFF WRITER

July 13 2001

SACRAMENTO -- The Democratic-led state Senate intends to fill constituent=
=20
mailboxes with a taxpayer-financed appeal urging Californians to demand=20
nearly $9 billion in energy price refunds from "greedy out-of-state power=
=20
generators."

Senate leader John Burton (D-San Francisco) said the mailers will ask=20
Californians to join the Senate and Gov. Gray Davis in insisting that the=
=20
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission order the refunds of alleged overcharg=
es.

Senate Democrats set the high target despite a federal mediator's ruling=20
against Davis earlier this week. The mediator said California would be=20
entitled to only about $1 billion in generator overcharges, not the $8.9=20
billion that Davis has fought for. Senate officers said the cost of the mai=
l=20
campaign will be paid from the budgets of senators, at taxpayer expense, as=
=20
part of the Legislature's constituent service mail program.

But Republicans attacked the mailer as political propaganda that may violat=
e=20
state law and Senate policy barring issuance of "partisan" documents at=20
public expense.

Sketchy details of the quietly developed project surfaced on the Senate flo=
or=20
Thursday. Staffers who worked on it said it was virtually impossible to=20
calculate the program's cost.

But they indicated that if all 26 Democrats agreed to send up to 30,000=20
mailers each to constituents, the postage alone would cost $140,400.

If each mass mailing exceeded 30,000 pieces, a higher postage rate would=20
apply, raising the cost, officials said.

In the mailer, constituents are asked to return an attached card to their=
=20
state senator, urging "full refunds of the outrageous prices charged by the=
=20
greedy out-of-state power generators."

Cynthia Lavagetto, manager of the Senate mail program, said each member wil=
l=20
decide what do do with the returned cards, including simply filing them or=
=20
sending them on to FERC.

Lavagetto said a prototype mailer was prepared with the help of the Select=
=20
Committee on Citizen Participation, a panel that has no chairman or members=
,=20
since it has not been activated this year. But it does maintain an office a=
nd=20
has three staffers on the Senate payroll.

Burton dismissed the Republican charges of partisanship as baseless. "We do=
=20
this all the time on a variety of issues," he said. "We're saying, 'Stop=20
stealing California's money.' "

But Sen. Ross Johnson of Irvine, the Senate's senior Republican, denounced=
=20
the mailing as clearly partisan. He said it appeared to reflect a developin=
g=20
2002 election strategy of Davis and Democrats to blame the FERC and=20
out-of-state generators for California's energy mess.

"I seriously question the appropriateness of using taxpayer money to get=20
people to lobby [for the refunds]," Johnson said.

Johnson and Sen. Ray Haynes (R-Riverside) suggested that Democrats turn the=
ir=20
criticism to municipal utilities, including the Los Angeles Department of=
=20
Water and Power. Some utilities charged the state even higher prices last=
=20
winter than did private generators.

"Why are they not attacking the DWP?" Johnson asked.

He noted that S. David Freeman was running the DWP at the time some of its=
=20
highest prices were charged to the state, which is buying power for=20
California's financially crippled utilities. Later, Davis hired Freeman as=
=20
his top energy price negotiator.

"Doesn't David Freeman more properly belong in that same jail cell as the g=
uy=20
called Spike than he does in the governor's office?" Johnson asked.

"Spike" has become a character in the California energy debate, thanks to=
=20
Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer, who is investigating whether power sellers engaged=
=20
in price-gouging and antitrust behavior.

In an interview with the Wall Street Journal in May, Lockyer said he would=

At least seven consultants hired by Gov. Gray Davis to help California buy=

The personal financial statements prompted Secretary of State Bill Jones, a=

as an electricity buyer.=20
"It's unbelievable. How does the public know these people are staying at=20

A Davis spokesman said administration lawyers are reviewing the documents a=

According to statements filed with the state's Fair Political Practice=20

PG&E customers get a payback for conservation=20
Nearly one-third earn rebates for cutting electricity use 20%=20

Nearly a third of Pacific Gas & Electric customers who have received this=
=20
month's bill got rebates totaling $7.6 million as a reward for slashing=20
electricity use in June, the utility said yesterday.=20
The program that cuts 20 percent off ratepayers' bills if they reduce usage=
=20
by 20 percent was a high-profile initiative by Gov. Gray Davis to promote=
=20
conservation and decrease dependence on out-of-state generators.=20
So far, PG&E has given credits to 394,000 ratepayers, or 29 percent of thos=
e=20
who have received their bills, said utility spokeswoman Staci Homrig.=20
Thousands of additional ratepayers stand to get rebates because the utility=
=20
has processed only a third of its billing cycle.=20
The news was giddily received by the Davis administration, which has made=
=20
conservation a cornerstone its plan to dig out of California's energy mess.=
=20
Administration officials had projected that 10 to 20 percent of customers=
=20
would conserve enough to get a rebate.=20
If only 10 percent of customers qualified, Davis estimated that the savings=
=20
to the state, which has been buying power on behalf of financially troubled=
=20
utilities, would be between $400 million and $1.3 billion. The less power=
=20
used means the less power the state has to purchase for the utilities on th=
e=20
expensive spot market.=20
'HEROIC EFFORT'=20
"Wow, this is fantastic," said Davis spokesman Roger Salazar. "What this sa=
ys=20
is that Californians are taking their conservation seriously. The governor=
=20
could not be prouder of their heroic effort so far."=20
About half the rebate amount, $3.7 million, went to 355,000 residential=20
customers, with $3.9 million going to 39,000 agricultural, industrial and=
=20
commercial customers. The utility will not have the amount of the average=
=20
rebate until later this month, when it completes the billing cycle.=20
To qualify, customers have to reduce their electricity use by 20 percent fo=
r=20
any of the four monthly billing periods that end in July, August, September=
=20
and October over a comparable period in 2000. Customers can get the rebate=
=20
for more than one month.=20
The rebate is labeled "California 20/20 Rebate," and appears on monthly bil=
ls=20
right above the line marked, "Total amount due."=20
Whether it be out of fear of dodging 260 hours of rolling blackouts predict=
ed=20
for the state this summer or the desire to save cash, the number of rebates=
=20
is another signal that Californians are conserving energy -- even if there =
is=20
some disagreement on how much.=20
Last month, Davis announced that power usage was down 11 percent in May aft=
er=20
being adjusted for growth and weather. In terms of raw, unadjusted data,=20
California's overall electricity consumption in May was down only about 2=
=20
percent from the previous year.=20
SWEET REWARD
That was little matter to those who received a rebate. For them, it was a=
=20
sweet reward for months of bumbling through darkened rooms, watching less T=
V=20
and enduring skyrocketing power bills.=20
Those who didn't get the rebate were disappointed. Especially if they have=
=20
endured small personal sacrifices in the hope of saving power and cash. For=
=20
example, Pierre Chomat, a retired engineering firm manager in Pacific Grove=
,=20
takes only two baths a week as part of his conservation plan. Despite his=
=20
bathing cutback -- and replacing incandescent bulbs with fluorescent ones a=
nd=20
turning off pilot lights -- Chomat's utility usage went up last month.=20
He blamed his three houseguests for robbing him of the chance at a rebate.=
=20
"They were taking baths and doing all sorts of things like that," Chomat=20
said. "And they were here for three weeks."=20
Chomat hopes to get a rebate next month. It may be his last chance for a=20
while; more houseguests are scheduled to arrive in August.=20

Judge spells out opposition to power refund claim=20

In a final written ruling that portrayed California negotiators as obstinat=
e=20
and unwilling to compromise, the judge who led talks over electricity price=
=20
refunds said yesterday the state's claim of $8.9 billion in overcharges "ha=
s=20
not and cannot be substantiated."=20
Three days after negotiations to reach an agreement ended in failure, Curti=
s=20
Wagner Jr., the chief administrative law judge of the Federal Energy=20
Regulatory Commission, said any refund to California would have to be much=
=20
less than what state representatives sought -- and would not come in cash.=
=20
"That very large refunds are due is clear," Wagner wrote in a 12-page opini=
on=20
to members of the commission, expanding on remarks he made publicly Monday.=
=20
"While the amount of such refunds is not $8.9 billion as claimed by the sta=
te=20
of California, they do amount to hundreds of millions of dollars, probably=
=20
more than a billion dollars.=20
"However," he went on, "the amount claimed by the state of California has n=
ot=20
and cannot be substantiated."=20
Wagner's opinion appeared to paint the California delegates to the 15 days =
of=20
talks as unreasonable, unwilling to negotiate and perhaps more motivated to=
=20
score political points than resolve the state's yearlong dispute over energ=
y=20
prices.=20
"There is an old saying down South that you can take a horse to water but y=
ou=20
can't make him drink," Wagner wrote. "The problem was that there were those=
=20
who simply did not want to negotiate, but rather, stood firm on their=20
litigation position with no movement."=20
Wagner wrote that California's negotiators had "summarily" rejected his=20
settlement proposal, but did not say what that was.=20
Collectively, the state's power providers made a counteroffer of slightly=
=20
more than $700 million. It was not clear if they ever offered to come up.=
=20
Michael Kahn, president of the state's Independent System Operator board an=
d=20
Davis' chief negotiator during the sessions, said the state refused to budg=
e=20
because generators had demanded exemptions from various inquiries. He said=
=20
the California delegation did not summarily reject the judge's proposal to=
=20
bring the parties to the table, saying Wagner never came up with a specific=
=20
plan or dollar figure.=20
Some energy analysts have argued that the $8.9 billion figure produced by t=
he=20
ISO was flawed from the start. The ISO made inaccurate assumptions about ga=
s=20
prices and the rate at which some plants burn it to generate electricity,=
=20
critics said, and it didn't look at whether the state's two main utilities=
=20
also charged prices above the competitive benchmark.=20
The ISO also looked at a period stretching back to May 2000, even though th=
e=20
date from which refunds would be considered in the negotiations began in=20
October.=20
Wagner said California and its utilities' debts to the energy providers --=
=20
estimated at $4.5 billion by some participants -- is larger than any refund=
=20
the power companies owe. As a result, he said, any refunds awarded to the=
=20
state should come in the form of either forgiveness of debt or lower prices=
=20
on long-term power contracts the state has signed.=20
Wagner suggested the federal commissioners hold 60 days of evidentiary=20
hearings, rather than relying on economic analysis, to figure out how much=
=20
the state might be owed.=20

The state has failed to prove California was overcharged anywhere near $8.9=
=20
billion for electricity, a federal judge said Thursday in a sharply critica=
l=20
recommendation on calculating potential refunds.=20
After two weeks of unsuccessful settlement talks, the judge overseeing them=
=20
agreed California is due ``very large refunds,'' but repeated his earlier=
=20
estimates that the amount is closer to $1 billion.=20
``The amount claimed by the state of California has not and cannot be=20
substantiated,'' Judge Curtis Wagner wrote in a 12-page recommendation urgi=
ng=20
a hearing within 60 days on the refund.=20
It is now up to the five-member Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to hol=
d=20
hearings and order refunds.=20
Wagner sharply criticized state officials for refusing to budge on the $8.9=
=20
billion.=20
Peter Navarro, an economist at the University of California-Irvine, said th=
e=20
judge ``sided with the generators on every single key issue.''=20
``The FERC judge adopted a set of rules that effectively slashed the size o=
f=20
California's possible refunds by up to 80 percent,'' Navarro said.=20
The recommendation left neither side cheering. State leaders were irked the=
=20
judge didn't back their number. They will press commissioners to order the=
=20
full refund immediately instead of the hearing.=20
``It is clear that Judge Wagner's recommendation undermines the consumer=20
protections that FERC is supposed to safeguard by law,'' U.S. Sen. Barbara=
=20
Boxer, D-Calif., said.=20
Gov. Gray Davis said he hopes President Bush's two new appointees on the=20
commission ``will be more sensitive to California consumers and order all t=
he=20
refunds that are due.''=20
Energy suppliers, who offered the state $703.6 million to settle the matter=
,=20
and industry officials greeted the recommendation with caution.=20
Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, a tra=
de=20
group, said he was ``encouraged'' the judge didn't back the state's figure.=
=20
But he added, ``there is no reason for us to be confident or comfortable.''=
=20
``We'll have to see how this hearing unfolds,'' he said.=20
A spokesman for Mirant Corp., one of the five major California power=20
generators, was circumspect. ``This is just another step in this process,''=
=20
Pat Dorinson said.=20
Wagner offered no specific refund figure of his own, repeating instead=20
estimates he made before the talks began.=20
``That very large refunds are due is clear,'' Wagner said. ``While the amou=
nt=20
of such refunds is not $8.9 billion as claimed by the state of California,=
=20
they do amount to hundreds of millions of dollars, probably more than a=20
billion dollars.''=20
That amount is far more than the $125 million in potential refunds federal=
=20
regulators had identified earlier this year. But it's still less than what=
=20
the state owes energy suppliers for past sales, meaning any refund would=20
probably be in the form of canceled debt.=20
The state's $8.9 billion figure was calculated by analysts who oversee the=
=20
power grid and has been hotly challenged by suppliers.=20
A key dispute is the period subject to refund. The state figure is based up=
on=20
sales from May 2000 to May 2001. But Wagner said the number should be=20
calculated from last October, when the federal commission notified sellers=
=20
they could face refunds.=20
Michael Kahn, the state's chief negotiator, said the figure could be up to =
$5=20
billion and said it was ``disappointing'' the judge wouldn't consider earli=

refunds. The state, he said, would continue pressing for them.=20
The judge recommended that the commission calculate refunds using its lates=

WASHINGTON -- A federal mediator said California 's claim to $8.9 billion i=

electricity refunds "cannot be substantiated," and questioned whether the=

state should get any money because it owes huge sums to energy sellers for=
=20
unpaid bills.=20
Curtis L. Wagner Jr., the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's chief=20
administrative law judge, said the state is owed "probably more than a=20

Mr. Wagner, who recently presided over unsuccessful talks aimed at settling=

the dispute, urged the commission to convene a "trial-type" hearing to figu=

"The differences between what the state of California believes the buyers i=

ia=20
market believe should be refunded raise material issues of fact," Mr. Wagne=

In his report, Mr. Wagner said the state had "summarily rejected" a=20
