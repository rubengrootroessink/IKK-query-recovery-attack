Dear Haas Community,

Sunday, June 10th, 2001, between 8:00 AM and noon, two servers will be
shut down for maintenance and upgrades. The NT web servers HCS-STUDENTS and
HCS-FACULTY will be shut down for installation of an operating system
update.   Also, the Development   server HAAS-DEVELOPMENT will be shutdown
temporarily for upgrade of its operating system.
While these servers are down student and faculty personal web sites, and
the development  data base will not be available.

Email service should not be affected.

As always,  should you experience any problems with computing services
following the maintenance, please contact the information desk in the
Computer Center, or helpdesk at http://helpdesk.haas.berkeley.edu, phone
510/642-0434.  Please note that Helpdesk is not manned on
weekends.  Requests for help logged during the weekend will be responded to

Your patience is greatly appreciated.

Thank you.
