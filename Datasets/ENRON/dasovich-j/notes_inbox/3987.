Lys,
re: the note about using a conference room here to utilize only one port:  
both of our conference rooms here are monopolized as well, so perhaps 
Sue & Jeff can "double up" in one of their respective offices, okay?

Thanks,
Joseph

Bernadette,

Please set up the call so that it starts at the beginning of the meeting, 2 
p.m. EDT.  (That way DC folks can dial-in near the TV so others can listen).  
I suggest scheduling the call for 3 hours to allow a discussion afterwards.

Also, please copy Lysa Akin on the call in info.

Thank you,

Alan Comnes
