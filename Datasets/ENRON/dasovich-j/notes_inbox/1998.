Attached is the latest on the TW/AOL - Earthlink deal we could scrounge up.  
Not too much to report, but we are keeping an eye out and will advise as we 
come across new details.  One item of interest: it does look like there will 
be some form of physical unbundling of the TW network to accomodate Earthlink 
beyond basic ISP services.  This could be a good sign for the deployment of 
VOD services.  Please let me know if you have any further questions or 
concerns.  Best, Scott

Scott, 

We are very interested in learning more about the Earthlink deal in relation 
to the Time Warner merger.  Is there a way we could access the proposed 
contract for ISP and Interactive TV services that is being proposed.  Is this 
in the public domain since it will be reviewed by the FTC.  We are searching 
for information on our side as well and calling our contacts at Earthlink, 
but any information you could find would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks
MARC
