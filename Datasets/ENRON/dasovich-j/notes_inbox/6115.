Thanks, Jeff, for your quick update.  Haven't had a chance to totally absorb
it (yes, it is crazy), but will do so this afternoon.  Keeping my fingers
crossed.  Best!

Hi Kari:

I know that you and I are both swamped, so I'm writing very briefly to give
you a brief update.  But first, thank you very much again for meeting last
week.  Greatly appreciated, and look forward to working together to help in
any way I can to find solution that is acceptable to all. Here's the
update:

Our "subcommitte" is meeting tomorrow to try to close the deal on a
proposed solution.  It focuses on 3 key areas:

Using the utilities retained assets to moderate prices.
Designing a framework for forward contracting that strikes a much more
appropriate balance in CA between state oversight and the need for
utility flexibility.
Rate stabilization/Undercollections (utility solvency)

I will update you tomorrow on the group's progress.  If thing's go
according to plan, we may be in a position to submit something to you a
early as Monday.  If there's a deadline from your end that I ought to be
aware of, let me know and I'll incorporate it into the subcommittee's work
plan.

In the meantime, if there is anything at all that I can do to help, please
don't hesitiate to contact me.

Thanks again and all the best,
Jeff
