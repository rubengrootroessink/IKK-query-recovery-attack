It seeks to modify D90-09-089 and D97-11-070 so that SoCal can waive the 10%
limit on monthly positive imbalances for noncore customers during winter
daily balancing periods and that noncore customers will be permitted to
combat gas price spikes by using their previous months' accumulated positive
imbalance volumes to meet "flowing supply" requirement.  As of today, SCG is
requiring noncore customers to meet a minimum of 90 percent of their daily
burn  from flowing supplies or from storage
