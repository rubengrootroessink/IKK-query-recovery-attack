Below is the transcript of an interview conducted yesterday with State=20
Treasurer Phil Angelides:

Summary:
? Bond Issuance to be $10B with 10-15 year term, 70% tax exempt and 30%=20
non-exempt
? Angelides in favor of wind fall profit tax
? Opposed to current discussion between Davis and Socal in regards to Socal=
=20
paying off the generators over 12 years with a 2-year grace period

What decisions on rate components are necessary before you can sell bonds?
"The big things we need are that the PUC must enter into agreement with DWR=
,=20
essentially warranting that sufficient revenues from rates will be availabl=
e=20
for purchasing power. It is really their job to define what each party need=
s=20
to pay for power. We need to give assurance to the investment community tha=
t=20
whatever the overall rate is, the state will get enough to pay its bonds.=
=20
However, if the utilities challenge the decision, it could stall the bond=
=20
issuance."
What do you think will be the size of the first bond issue?
"Based on what is currently possible and what the legislature has authorize=
d,=20
around $10bn. The PUC has allowed us to sell north of  $13bn, but we=20
anticipate that $10bn is absorbable. Until the administration provides=20
details for this office and the public on what its costs of buying power ar=
e=20
and what it needs in terms of funding, what will drive it is that number, n=
ot=20
what the PUC has said. The issuance may well be a single $10bn issue or a=
=20
series of smaller ones done together, e.g. $3bn each 3 weeks apart."
What is the total size of the market for CA tax-exempt bonds?
"What we do normally is $5-10bn in bonds for various revenues or general=20
obligations. In 1997 the CA infrastructure rate reductions bonds was a $7bn=
=20
issuance, and this was handled well.  This is not exclusively a CA market. =
=20
Around $200bn of these bonds is sold each year.   We anticipate that the=20
bonds will be 70% tax-exempt and 30% non-exempt."
What is the total of electric supply contracts that are firm enough to=20
require funding?
"We have estimates. The DWR is buying power, and let=01,s say power costs $=
100=20
and its portion of rates is $70. This bond issuance covers the diff between=
=20
$100 and $70. So, the bond issuance is a way to cover the gap. However, if=
=20
power prices do not come down, you cannot keep borrowing.  If we issue more=
=20
than $10bn in bonds, I have to see the whole financial plan.  (The=20
implication is that he will not keep this plan secret.)"
What will be the term mix of the bond issues?
"Overall term is expected to be in the 10-15 year range.  I do not know the=
=20
mix."
Do you have the ability to do bridging tax anticipation notes or anything=
=20
like that to take care of the general fund?
"The very purpose of the bridge loan is that we are taking a taxable and=20
tax-exempt bridge loan until bonds are issued.  In order for us to issue=20
bonds, a number of steps have to occur. I would hope that the PUC and DWR d=
o=20
what they have to do realistically by June.  Then the bond issuance would=
=20
come semi all-at-once.  (In other words, either all at once, or something=
=20
like $3 billion every three weeks.)"
Are all of the general funds=01, assets in cash, or are some in the form of=
 a=20
less liquid receivable?
"We have a lot of liquidity in real cash in general fund.  We have a cash=
=20
flow. We have the ability in pooled money investment accounts so that we ca=
n=20
go out to five years. We have $40bn-plus in that account."
What is the minimum working capital required in the general fund for=20
day-to-day operations?
"It depends, and goes up and down.  On any given day we are doing on the=20
order of $500mm. There is a $100bn budget between the general funds and=20
special fund."
Are you discussing the DWR contracting in relation to the required funding?=
=20
Do you have a veto on the deals struck?
"This is all in the administration=01,s court.  What we have asked for is t=
he=20
information.  We have asked for this today by letter.  We have to move from=
=20
working with 3 or 4 banks to a public offering, which means public=20
disclosure.  The general fund has been making advances to buy power, but we=
=20
want to get out of that business and to stop the $4bn plus drain on general=
=20
fund from arranging an interim loan."
What is the credit risk from industry or other large users cherry picking o=
r=20
self-selecting?
"There are limits on the options out there.  AB1X has limited the ability o=
f=20
people to opt out of the system.  If you do allow them to opt out, what do=
=20
they have to pay to preserve the revenue stream? The agreement between the=
=20
DWR and the PUC will say that, through a financing order, we will get you t=
he=20
revenue to service the bonds, even if it adjusts rates.  This will be a=20
covenant that the money will be made available."
If an initiative is launched could it create enough uncertainty to have an=
=20
effect on ABIX or the bond issuance? What about =01&Harvey proofing=018?  W=
hat is=20
the direct state participation?
"The state=01,s role is infrastructure and economic development.  Bonds wil=
l be=20
issued in name of DWR only to pay for power the state is buying, not to rep=
ay=20
utility deb.  I don=01,t think the state will repay utility debt.  The stat=
e can=20
buy power in or out of Chapter 11.  There will be no participation by the=
=20
state bank.  I know Harvey well, and he and I agree on a number of things. =
=20
For example, I am cosponsoring the public power authority. We should not pu=
t=20
the state in the business of refinancing utility debt.  I don=01,t think mo=
st=20
consumer groups realize that we are selling bonds to pay for power.  I very=
=20
much want, and it is in my interest, to repay the general fund.  At the sam=
e=20
time that this office is financing the purchase of energy, the fundamental=
=20
problem is the price we are being charged by the generators-the ransom that=
=20
is being demanded by the generators. I agree with Harvey that as of this=20
current time the generators are winning.  We will have to consider excess=
=20
profits taxes, or if the generators continue, they have increased their=20
prices tenfold.  The generators they bought a set of plants for $3.1bn. =20
Since January the state has spent over $4bn.  If the generators don=01,t ta=
ke=20
their foot off our throat, they may leave us no option but to take back=20
plants under emergency power.   So let them justify those rates.  What caus=
es=20
the problem is the generators jacking up prices to the point where they wil=
l=20
make us do something about it."
What is the =01&measurable size premium=018 that will have to be paid based=
 on the=20
most current estimates of bond issue size?
"Measurable is the wrong choice of words.  We don=01,t know how many basis=
=20
points. If it is more than $10bn, we will begin to feel it.=20
Also, I am not for that proposal to allow the utilities to pay off the=20
generators over 12 years with a 2-year grace period. They should work that=
=20
out themselves, not on the backs of ratepayers.  The perspective here is th=
at=20
they did very, very well in 1996, 97 and 98.  They upstreamed billions."
