NOTICE OF STAFF TECHNICAL CONFERENCE

(May 3, 2001)

 Take notice that the staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will 
hold a public conference on Thursday, May 24, 2001, to address issues 
regarding the natural gas transportation infrastructure with respect to 
California.  The conference will begin at 10:00 a.m., at the Commission's 
offices, 888 First Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20426.  All interested 
persons are invited to attend.

 As Commission staff has dealt with various aspects of the current energy 
situation in California, questions have arisen regarding current and 
projected interstate natural gas pipeline capacity to California, as well as 
the adequacy of the natural gas infrastructure within California.  Commission 
staff is interested in the views of natural gas transporters, producers, 
consumers, regulators, and other interested parties with respect to issues 
including:

 1) current and projected interstate pipeline capacity to California;

2) current and projected capacity of California intrastate pipelines and 
other      natural gas infrastructure;

 3) physical and operational interconnection between the interstate and 
intrastate                 transportation systems; 

 4) current and projected California demand for natural gas; and

 5) how intrastate capacity in California is allocated.

The conference will not include the discussion of any ongoing proceedings 
before the  Commission.

 The conference will be organized in two stages.  The first stage will 
consist of presentations of factual information on the topics listed above.  
The second stage will consist of discussion on the topics.

 Persons interested in making presentations or participating in any 
discussion should indicate their interest no later than May 14, 2001 by a 
letter addressed to the Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 888 
First Street, NE, Washington, D.C., 20426, and should refer to Docket No. 
PL01-4-000.  Each request to participate must include a contact person, 
telephone number, and E-mail address.

 Each request must also indicate whether the person is interested in making a 
presentation or participating in discussion.  For those interested in making 
presentations, the request should indicate what topics the presentation will 
cover.  Because of the potential need to limit the number of presentations, 
those with common interests are encouraged to choose a single spokesperson.

 After receipt of the requests, staff may issue a subsequent notice setting 
forth the conference format, or may inform participants of the format at the 
beginning of the conference.  Depending on the number of presentations, it 
may be necessary for staff to contact presenters prior to the conference to 
coordinate the presentations.
