Electricity deregulation brings on crisis in California

From: Petrostrategies --

California's power generators blame the 'rigid nature' of the deregulated 
energy sector for the prevailing electricity crisis, which has seen wholesale 
power prices jump by as much as $500/Mwhr from $150/Mwhr in summer 1999 even 
as retail prices have been frozen until March 2002. Meanwhile, since demand 
has grown by a mere 3% from mid-1999, some consumers fear that the crisis has 
arisen, not from Californian deregulation, but from power generators who are 
taking advantage of the crisis to earn more. Tasked to act on the problem, 
FERC is to announce the results of its probe on the energy crisis by 
11/1/2000.
