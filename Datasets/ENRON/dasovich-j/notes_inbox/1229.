Hi Jeff,

We met, at least telephonically, while I was still in EES' San Ramon office 
on some substation projects we were working on last year.  I've since moved 
on to Houston (all roads lead there, so they say), and am now in Structuring 
and working on some of the new, heavy industrial deals that EES has inherited 
from ENA. I've got a customer who is a petroleum refiner in Downey, CA - 
right in the middle of LA - who is interested in potentially building a cogen 
plant, perhaps as big as 49 MW. Air emissions issues completely aside (the 
nightmare can wait), can you tell me what the current status of new QF 
development is with SCE?  I've checked with all the commodity guys I know 
here on the floor, and they're not up to date.  Greg Cordell thought that, as 
part of AB1890, the UDCs got a moratorium on new QFs in their territory - as 
in, they don't have to accept any more projects.

Can you shed any light on the topic? If you're not the guy, do you know who I 
should talk to?

Thanks a bunch!
