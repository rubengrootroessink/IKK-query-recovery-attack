Folks-
Attached are a redline and clean version of the legislative language. Please
review it carefully to make sure that I have not missed anything. I will be
sending this to Rick Simpson tomorrow at 9:00 am. Any requested changes must
be signed off on BY ALL PARTIES and emailed to me before that 9:00 deadline
or they will not be included.

Thanks to all of you for work on this document.

Delaney
