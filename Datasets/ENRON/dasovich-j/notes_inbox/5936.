Greetings Kari:

Forgive the delay.  Much going on today, PUC draft decision in particular.
The draft does not look promising for the utilities' financial position.

Attached are our comments on the Governor's Proposals and some more detail
on the demand-reduction proposal.  We continue to work on the Nord Pool
research for you and will turn that around as quickly as we can.

Again, don't hesitate to contact me if there's anything else I can help
with, or if there's anything else that you need. (415.782.7822)

Best,
Jeff
