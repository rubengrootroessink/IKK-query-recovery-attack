Thanks Jeff.  I'll go through this and likely follow up with you again.  Rick 
Shapiro said he thought we had some powerpoint slides already prepared on our 
experience in California and that you would also be the resource for those.  
Is this right? If so please send them to me.  

Regards,

Rob

Subject: Hard Lessons from California    

Rob:
Here's a quick and dirty list of some lessons from California that Alberta 
may not want to repeat.  Steve, let me know if I've missed any messages we're 
using to describe California's woes (or mangled any, for that matter.  If you 
have any questions, don't hestitate to get in touch. 

Best,
Jeff
