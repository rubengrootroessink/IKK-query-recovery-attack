Dear Rick and Jeff:
 I'm the Project Director for the CAEM RED Index and Ken Malloy suggested I
send this request to you.  We have contacted the CPUC for their response to
our survey update, but their press of business results in no response from
them to us.  The dramatic changes in California from December 2000 to June
2001 makes it imperative that we have some intelligence on updating the
individual attributes.  Based on the attached PDF file description of the
attributes and the Word document table of characterizations which shows year
end 2000 and a blank for May 2001, could you help me by filling in those
blanks based on your knowledge of state legislation, CPUC orders or anything
else official that has changed the way they implement their electric
restructuring plan?  I don't expect an answer to the seven survey questions,
but feel free to provide your response just for my education.

 I've sent this request to Commissioner Bilas, who works with Ken, but he
couldn't offer any assistance, so I'm relying on the industry to fill in the
blanks.  If you have any other suggestions of who might be able to respond
to this information, it would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks for your help.
