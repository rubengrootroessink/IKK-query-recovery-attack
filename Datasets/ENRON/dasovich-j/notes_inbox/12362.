currently a place holder on next Thursday's?business  agenda.

The CEC is  asking for SVMG support  in light of the changes  made to our=

request, especially since  the CEC  included:

? --  the conservation incentive (which the utilities will probably  fight)

? --  temperature sensitivity as a basis for non-standard CBL

We  should be prepared to respond to their request at Tuesday=01,s Energy=

Thanks,
