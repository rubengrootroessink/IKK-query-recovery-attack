This is it, folks.  This one is for all the marbles.  For the whole
enchilada.  To separate the wheat from the chaff.  It=01,s for all the glor=
y.
We=01,re going for the whole nine yards.  Going for the gold.  Laying it on=
 the
line.  We=01,re not playing anymore - this one=01,s for real.  Yep, it=01,s=
 the last
and final round of voting in the HaasWeek Survivor Contest.  (Yes, I know
that =01&last and final=018 is redundant.  It=01,s for emphasis.)

Just two contestants are left: Anne Brocchini and Ben Soccorsy.  Based on
your decisions, one will win a digital camera and the other will go crying
home to mommy.  One will be voted off of the HaasWeek Island and the other,
well, the other will leave the island, too, because the contest will be
over.  But the second one will be happier.  And maybe we=01,ll make the los=
er
swim back, yeah.

So, there=01,s just one more chance to vote in the inaugural HaasWeek Survi=
vor
Contest.  And with our sophisticated online polling process (which you can
access at www.haasweek.net <http://www.haasweek.net>), you know that your
vote will be meaningful and accurately counted.  No recounts, no pregnant o=
r
dimpled chad, nothing but real, accurate results.  Because in a decision
this important, HaasWeek wants to make sure we accurately reflect the true
will of the people.

Vote now at www.haasweek.net <http://www.haasweek.net>!  Polls will be open
until Wednesday evening at 5pm, so don=01,t delay!  The fate of the free wo=
rld
is at your fingertips.  Or at least the fate of one digital camera.  Which
is pretty important, too.

Thanks and enjoy!
HaasWeek
