Sue, Mona, Jeff.

Hi.  Attached is an outline  summary of the California gas "analogy" and 
PGE's proposed procurement options for its retail electric customers.  I 
prepared this summary to help me think about a legislative proposal for Rod 
Wright's list, item no. 6.

I have to admit I am a bit fuzzy about ARM's proposal for default utility 
procurement service.  How far off is it from PGE's propsal, which is to offer 
customers one of of several standardized commodity products?  Can you share 
anything on ARM's position with me?

Also, Enron's "Bench Product" was discussed on the call.  Do any of you have 
anything on that product?

Cheers,

Alan
