Jeff:  Secretary Richardson did that, too.  BPA began delivering power 
yesterday afternoon under an immediate 2-1 payback arrangement with the 
return to have commenced yesterday evening.  When no power was returned, BPA 
shut off power at 7:00 a.m Pacific Time with immediate Conference Calls 
between acting Administrator Steve Wright still on-going to seek remedy.

Might have perhaps been simpler if Bill "Al Haig" Richardson had announced at 
the press conference yesterday that he was ordering his energy company, BPA, 
to stop "withholding" and send power to California.

DOE and FERC just briefed the Hill and confirmed they never issued the Order 
yesterday since Bonneville released a lot more power late yesterday.  The 
Administration advised that if the situation warrants, they will indeed issue 
the Order.  This remains a fluid situation with Richardson yesterday 
announcing his intent to "sign an Order" which his staff had not yet written 
while in the interim BPA acted so as to make his announcement moot.

We will continue to apprise you of the developments including reports of 
FERC's surprise site inspections.
