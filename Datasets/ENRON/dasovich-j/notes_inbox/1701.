Dear Jeff

Thanks for the message. Yes, a great pity we missed each other. If I had
known of your timetable constraints we could have discussed possibilities at
the reception. I sympathised with what you had to say at the symposium and
would like to learn more.

I have just arrived in Washington DC, where I shall be until Saturday, then
returning to UK. I have a meeting tomorrow (Thursday) morning but otherwise
would be free to meet, if you were planning to be over here. Another
possibility might be to talk on the phone. Tel 202 363 3350 c/o Lois
Godiksen, though I call in at LECG tomorrow afternoon.  Or of course I
should be pleased to see you in UK.  I shall be there next week, then in
Japan for a week, then likely to be in UK for rest of December. I am
normally in Birmingham rather than London, but it would not be too difficult
to get to London for a meeting. I had wondered about the possiblity of
coming to the American Economic Association meetings in New Orleans in early
January, after which I would come up to DC again. That might be another
opportunity to get together.

I did talk to David Teece briefly, and he mentioned a possible joint venture
with several companies, without naming them - is this what you are referring
to? He said very little about it so I would welcome a discussion.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Best wishes

Stephen
