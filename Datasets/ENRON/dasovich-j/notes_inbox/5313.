Enron CEO: Calif. Law To Delay Portland General Sale
By Christina Cheddar
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

Dow Jones News Service=20

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) Chief Executive Kenneth Lay said a=
=20
California law has had the unintended effect of delaying Enron's sale of it=
s=20
Portland General unit to Sierra Pacific Resources (SRP).=20

At the end of January, California legislators ordered the state's utilities=
=20
not to sell power plants before January 2006. The new law might prevent=20
Sierra Pacific Power, a unit of Sierra Pacific Resources, from selling its=
=20
power plants because it serves 40,000 customers in California's Lake Tahoe=
=20
area.

Sierra Pacific was trying to sell the assets to finance its acquisition of=
=20
Portland General, Lay said. Sierra Pacific is attempting to get a=20
clarification of the legislation from California authorities, he said.=20

Lay's confidence level regarding the company's ability to close the Portlan=
d=20
General sale remains "pretty high, but it's not 98 percent," he said.=20

Lay said the delayed sale will not hurt the company's earnings performance.=
=20
In fact, Lay expects Portland General to add to its earnings.=20
Lay was speaking at the UBS Warburg Energy Conference here Thursday.=20

When asked if credit risks in California could affect Enron's earnings, Lay=
=20
responded there is no scenario in the state that would make the company=20
unable to reach its $1.70 to $1.75 a share earnings estimate for 2001.=20

Lay explained that the company is taking measures to mitigate its credit=20
risk. California's two largest utilities, Southern California Edison Co. an=
d=20
Pacific Gas and Electric Co., have been heading toward insolvency after=20
purchasing power in the state's deregulated markets at higher prices than t=
he=20
utilities could charge their customers.=20

Most of Enron's credit risk in California comes from the selling of gas and=
=20
electric power in the state through its wholesale services operation.=20

"There's quite a mess out there, and we hope that eventually, that mess wil=
l=20
get worked out," Lay said.=20

During his presentation, Lay also discussed the success of EnronOnline. He=
=20
said EnronOnline has reduced the average cost per trading transaction by 75=

Crt Postpones Hearing On CalPX Back-Billing Suppliers

Dow Jones Energy Service=20

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A U.S. District Court Judge has postponed until=
=20
Tuesday hearing arguments in a case involving Enron Corp.'s (ENE) request=
=20
that the California Power Exchange not be able to charge the company for=20
electricity bills defaulted on by the state's two largest utilities, a=20
spokesperson for the CalPX said Thursday.=20

The judge also extended until Tuesday a temporary order barring the CalPX=
=20
from billing Enron for the utilities' defaults until the case is heard.

Other power marketers and generators have similar lawsuits filed in federal=
=20
court and with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.=20

At issue is a "chargeback" insurance mechanism that is meant to maintain=20
participants' confidence in the exchange. Under the mechanism, defaults by=

level of participation in the exchange in the three months prior to the=20
default.=20

Sources close to the case said they believed the court was waiting for acti=

from the FERC before continuing with the case. However, this couldn't be=20

Judge Resets Enron Hearing, Cites Expected Federal Decision

Los Angeles, Feb. 15 (Bloomberg) -- A federal judge rescheduled a hearing o=
n=20
whether California's power market should be kept from billing its members,=
=20
mostly energy suppliers, because utilities owned by PG&E Corp. and Edison=
=20
International have defaulted on payments.

U.S. District Judge Carlos Moreno continued the hearing to Feb. 20 at 4 p.m=
.=20
A temporary order issued last week to prevent the California Power Exchange=
=20
electricity market from billing members such as Enron Corp. will be extende=
d=20
until the hearing.

PG&E and Edison International have defaulted on at least $789 million in=20
debts; under exchange rules, all members can be charged when one defaults.

Enron sued in Los Angeles federal court Jan. 31. Other generators -- Avista=

all its members when one defaults. Nine generators filed their complaint wi=

Texas Pilot Project for Electricity Competition Begins Today

KRTBN Knight-Ridder Tribune Business News: The Dallas Morning News - Texas=
=20
Copyright (C) 2001 KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News; Source: World=
=20
Reporter (TM)=20

So, you're mad about your electricity bill and wish you could change to=20
another electricity company? Starting Thursday, a lot of Texans can tell=20
their current electric company to get lost, and the customers probably will=
=20
lower their electric rates as well.

The state is kicking off a pilot program to see how competition in its=20
electricity markets will work. Thursday is the first day that 19 companies=
=20
will be allowed to begin signing up customers.=20

June 1 is the first day that these power companies can begin providing=20
electricity to customers who decide to switch. The three and a half months=
=20
until then will be used to market their services and sign up customers.=20

The limited test will allow 5 percent of all utility customers to pick thei=
r=20
electricity company -- either their current company or one of many others=
=20
that have signed up to sell electricity in Texas.=20

The test is a dress rehearsal for Jan. 1, when all customers of Texas=20
"investor-owned utilities" -- companies such as TXU Electric, Reliant Energ=
y=20
Inc. and Texas-New Mexico Power Co. -- will have a chance to take their=20
business elsewhere.=20

"In essence, it's to see that all the rules and ramifications of=20
restructuring are working properly," said Terry Hadley, spokesman for the=
=20
Public Utility Commission of Texas. "If there are any bugs, we want to find=
=20
out before the full launch Jan. 1."=20

State officials were already nervous about their grand experiment in free=
=20
markets, but the current debacle in California has them even more on edge.=
=20

California, which partially deregulated its electricity markets several yea=
rs=20
ago, now has two public utilities teetering on the edge of bankruptcy and=
=20
unable to pay for electricity they bought. Homes and businesses have faced=
=20
rolling blackouts as the state at times hasn't been able to scrape up enoug=
h=20
electricity to meet demand.=20

While the Public Utility Commission and others have repeatedly said that=20
Texas won't repeat the California experience, they're looking to the pilot=
=20
program to expose any flaws.=20

For the first month, the state and electric providers will concentrate on=
=20
commercial customers. In mid-March, they'll turn their attention to home=20
customers.=20

However, Public Utility Commission chairman Pat Wood III said both=20
residential and commercial customers may sign up beginning Thursday.=20

Commercial users must go through a lottery to be chosen, and the 5 percent=
=20
will be based on total commercial electricity used.=20

Residential customers will be added on a first-come, first-picked basis, wi=
th=20
the cutoff after 5 percent of all residential customers have volunteered fo=
r=20
the program.=20

A key to the Texas program is the "price to beat," the basic rate that the=
=20
utilities can charge. That price will be a 6 percent reduction from the=20
electric rates charged by the utilities before the pilot program begins.=20

The investor-owned utilities also include Central Power & Light, Southweste=
rn=20
Electric Power Co., Entergy, SESCO and Southwestern Public Service Co.=20

Other companies can charge whatever they please, but as Mr. Hadley noted,=
=20
they probably won't get too far charging more than the "price-to-beat" rate=
s=20
of the utilities.=20

When the Texas Legislature passed Senate Bill 7 in 1999 to start retail=20
competition in electricity, the price-to-beat rate was set up to give=20
competitors a chance to compete against the entrenched utilities.=20

Mr. Hadley said the price to beat provides other electric retailers=20
"something to work against." In addition, the 6 percent reduction from the=
=20
utilities' current rates would be "enough of a cut to provide a customer a=
=20
benefit, but not so low as to prevent competition," he said.=20

Of course, the utilities don't have their hands tied in areas outside their=
=20
current monopoly territory, and most plan to compete aggressively for=20
customers.=20

For example, TNP Enterprises Inc., parent of Texas-New Mexico Power, has=20
created a subsidiary, First Choice Power Inc., to lead its fight in the=20
electric wars.=20

Jim Niewald, First Choice director of marketing, said the company will use=
=20
the pilot period as a learning time, to test ways to compete and to market=
=20
its products.=20

"We're going to take a sort of moderate approach. We're not going to be rea=
l=20
aggressive. On the other hand, we're not going to be sitting back totally,"=
=20
Mr. Niewald said.=20

TXU spokesman Chris Schein said the Dallas-based company sees the pilot=20
period as a time to work out kinks and discover if there are any inherent=
=20
problems in the way that electricity competition in Texas works.=20

"It's important to remember that the pilot program is less of a marketing=
=20
event than it is an opportunity for TXU and the rest of the state to test=
=20
systems. The real marketing opportunity begins Jan. 1, 2002," Mr. Schein=20
said.=20

"We are treating this as an opportunity to make sure our systems are=20
communicating with all the state's systems to make the customers' choosing=
=20
process as seamless as possible," he said.=20

While TXU will be trying to sign up customers in the parts of Texas that it=
=20
doesn't now serve, it also has to deal with the price-to-beat rate freeze=
=20
that will keep it from offering discounts in its current service area,=20
including Dallas-Fort Worth, Central Texas and other spots.=20

TXU is hoping that its existing customers want more than the lowest price,=
=20
Mr. Schein said, "in the same way that not every customer chooses a car bas=
ed=20
on price. If that were true, Kia would be the best-selling car in the U.S."=
=20

TXU will be promoting its quality of service and a package of bundled=20
services that it hopes will be attractive. For those who care about the=20
environment, TXU will offer "green power," or electricity generated by wind=
=20
or other nonfossil sources.=20

Also entering the fray will be Green Mountain Energy Co., which sells nothi=
ng=20
but green power.=20

"We are looking forward to bringing Texans the opportunity to support clean=
er=20
air by purchasing power made from cleaner and renewable sources," Green=20
Mountain chief executive officer Dennis Kelly said in a prepared statement.=
=20

"One of the most powerful benefits of electric choice is the ability for=20
people to choose how their power is made," he said.=20

"As more people understand that making electricity causes more air pollutio=
n=20
than any other industry," he continued, "they will look for a simple way to=
=20
purchase electricity that includes clean renewable sources like wind, sun a=
nd=20
hydropower."=20

Enron Corp., the Houston energy giant, has three companies that will compet=
e=20
for customers in the deregulated world.=20

Two of its subsidiaries will target large customers: Enron Power Marketing=
=20
Inc. will sell to wholesale customers such as utilities and other electric=
=20
retailers, and Enron Energy Services Inc. will go after large commercial an=
d=20
industrial customers.=20

For residential customers and small businesses, Enron has teamed up with IB=
M=20
Corp. and America Online to sell electricity through the New Power Company.=
=20
New Power is part of New Power Holdings Inc., a public company.=20

"Different customers need different products, so we've created specialized=
=20
businesses for what the market needs," Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said.=20

For big customers, Enron can afford real-time pricing that charges less for=
=20
off-peak periods, more for peak periods.=20

It can offer discounts for customers who agree to have their electricity=20
interrupted when needed.=20

However, residential customers mainly want to see a fixed, cheap rate, Mr.=
=20
Palmer said.=20

"Homeowners aren't interested in real-time prices, interruptible service or=

Others who have received state certification or are awaiting approval are=

The companies are keen to get more details about three huge gas projects th=

USA: INTERVIEW-NYMEX Head Says No Regrets Over Online Strategy.

(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Departing New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX)=
=20
Chairman Daniel Rappaport is confident that enymex - NYMEX's online venture=

will soon become the premier online energy trading platform, he said Thursd=

While the new venture, now slated to launch in May, has suffered several=20
delays, Rappaport says he has no regrets about rebuffing an approach last=

year from rival platformIntercontinentalExchange (ICE), which is now up and=
=20
running.

Rappaport, who will turn 47 in a few weeks, will have to watch from afar to=
=20
see if his strategy succeeds. He steps down from the helm of the world's=20
biggest physical commodity exchange next month.=20

"I agonized over (the decision to step down) for a long time," he said. "Bu=
t=20
I just wasn't prepared to sign on and commit for another three years."=20

NYMEX, along with its COMEX subsidiary, trades futures and options contract=
s=20
on crude oil, heating oil, unleaded gasoline, gold, silver, natural gas,=20

enymex will first offer trading in crude oil, petroleum products and natura=
l=20
gas. Later it will expand to electricity, coal, metals and other products.=
=20

enymex is well positioned to succeed, Rappaport said. Among its advantages=
=20
are the NYMEX brand, liquidity from NYMEX traders and clearing services.=20

"Not a single exchange from those now operating online offers real clearing=
,"=20
he said.=20

In a field of more than 30 Internet energy exchanges, observers usually poi=
nt=20

as=20
success stories so far. But Rappaport counts neither as competitors enymex=

EnronOnline trades an average of $3.5 billion a day, but does not accept=20
third party trades, so Rappaport doesn't put it in the same category as=20
enymex.=20

ICE has enough liquidity to be a leader among fledgling independent online=
=20
exchange, but its numbers are far from those of an established exchange lik=
e=20
NYMEX.=20

In its first week trading crude options this year, ICE traded 3 million=20
barrels. NYMEX routinely trades more than 400 million barrels of crude in a=
=20
single day.=20

That's exactly the kind of competition the partners in ICE hoped to elimina=
te=20
when they invited NYMEX to join the venture early last year, Rappaport said=
.=20

"Legally, we wouldn't have been able to launch enymex if we were part of=20
ICE," he explained.=20

With backing from some of the world's leading energy firms, ICE is in talks=
=20
with London's International Petroleum Exchange (IPE) for a possible merger,=
=20
in a move designed to attract more liquidity to the fledgling online=20
exchange.=20

After a failed hostile takeover a few years ago, NYMEX has itself reiterate=
d=20
its interest in buying a controlling stake in the IPE this year, but only i=
f=20
the London exchange welcomes such a move. So far, the IPE has not signaled=
=20
that it would accept NYMEX's overtures, Rappaport said.=20

NEW CHAIRMAN TO TAKE NYMEX TO IPO=20
Under Rappaport, NYMEX demutualized and became a for-profit organization la=
st=20
year.=20
The new chairman, to be elected March 20, will have to lead the exchange=20
through a private placement and on to an IPO.=20

"The new chairman has to go on a road show to sell the exchange," Rappaport=
=20
said.=20
NYMEX will offer a 10 percent stake in itself in the private placement, in =
