The Answer, My Friend=01(
?
How do we develop a cleaner, sustainable electric industry? The answer is =
=20
literally blowing in the wind. In fact, about 100 MW of new wind generation=
=20
will  be operating in Pennsylvania by 2001 =01* a small portion of the=20
Commonwealth=01,s  total wind resource, which is enough to produce about 13=
=20
billion kWh or 10% of  Pennsylvania=01,s total electricity consumption. But=
=20
challenges must be overcome to  keep this crop from fading into thin air.=
=20
?
Why are obstacles being overcome to make wind power part of Pennsylvania=01=
,s =20
energy future? Customers want clean energy, and wind is readily available, =
=20
especially in the northeastern, central and southwestern areas of our state=
. =20
While some other states have better wind resources, Pennsylvania has plenty=
=20
of  Class 3 wind resources and a good bit of Class 4, much of which is=20
located in  rural communities. Ironically, sufficient wind resources are al=
so=20
often found in  formerly important coal centers that were decimated when=20
machines replaced human  labor and mines were emptied of marketable coal. I=
t=20
could offer these  communities a sustainable economic future, as the wind i=
s=20
never mined out.
?
Just one year ago, when E-cubed discussed reasons to =01&Go With the  Wind,=
=018=20
(Vol. I, No. 9, 9/14/99) no commercial wind farms were operating in =20
Pennsylvania, but our state had, and still has, the most vibrant customer=
=20
choice  program in America. Today, there are already two new, clean renewab=
le=20
wind  generation facilities that were built in direct response to consumer=
=20
demand. =20
?
The 10.4 MW Green Mountain Farm in Garrett, Somerset County, can produce =
=20
about 25,000 MWh of electricity, enough to serve about 2,500 households eac=
h =20
year.? The 130 kW Pennsylvania Wind Energy Project in Hazleton, Luzerne =20
County, can produce about 200,000 kWh of electricity and will double in siz=
e =20
this fall. But even when additional 130kW turbines are installed, Community=
 =20
Energy=01,s =01&wind block=018 sales will have served only about half of th=
e small =20
commercial customer load that subscribed to its limited =01&pilot=018 marke=
ting =20
program. These two operating wind farms avoid 123 tons of S02, 12,000? tons=
=20
of CO2, and 4,700 tons of  NOx.
?
Two larger wind farms are expected to be operating next year. Atlantic =20
Renewable and International Wind are developing a 15.6 MW Mill Run wind far=
m=20
in  Fayette County, and National Wind Power is developing a facility near=
=20
Scranton,  Lackawanna County, which will produce at least 15 MW initially.=
=20
Although not all  will be completed by the end of 2001, seven other project=
s=20
by five active wind  developers are scheduled to provide an additional 110 =
MW=20
of new wind generation  in Pennsylvania during and after 2001. The wind=20
industry expects that about 200  MW could be built in Pennsylvania within t=
wo=20
to three years. If 100 MW of  additional wind generation replaced system=20
power, Pennsylvania would avoid 1,250  tons of SO2, 123,000? tons of CO2  a=
nd=20
48,000?tons of NOx.
?
These new wind developments are fueled not just by wind, but by investment =
=20
dollars and consumer demand as well. The Pennsylvania Wind Development=20
Program  recently announced the availability of wind energy production=20
incentives, for  new facilities that become operational by the end of 2001,=
=20
of up to 1.5  cents/kwh for five years. The program, operated for the=20
Sustainable Development  Fund by The Reinvestment Fund, will receive $12=20
million from settlement of the  PECO/Unicom merger, which is expected to=20
become final in November.=20
?
Construction by the end of 2001 is also important because the federal =20
Production Tax Credit for new wind development expires at that time, and it=
=20
is  unclear if it will be renewed.=20
?
Production incentives are crucial for wind power, especially in =20
Pennsylvania, where wind resources tend to peak in both the winter and=20
during  the late evening hours when the demand for electricity is low. In t=
he=20
current  market, the estimated average energy value from wind power is only=
=20
about 1.5 to  2.0 cents/kWh. The =01&green attribute=018 can fetch about an=
other=20
2.0 cents/kwh for  total market revenues of around 4.0 cents per=20
kilowatt-hour.
?
California wind production, on the other hand, generally peaks in the =20
afternoon when the demand for electricity is high, resulting in average=20
electric  sales value of approximately 3.0 cents/kWh.=20
?
By comparison, wind costs about 5.0 cents per kilowatt-hour to produce in =
=20
Pennsylvania.? The cost is on the way down, although it could be some time =
=20
before it dips as low as the 3.0 cents and less mark in those areas of the =
=20
country with the very best wind resources.=20
?
However, total generation costs of Pennsylvania wind compare favorably to =
=20
all-in nuclear generation costs, such as Limerick=01,s 8.5 cents/kwh and =
=20
Susquehanna's near 7.0 cent all-in cost, but still cost about 33% more than=
 =20
total costs of a new fossil fuel plant. Of course, existing nuclear plants=
=20
do  not have to recover the all-in production costs through the market,=20
because  those costs are subsidized by stranded costs payments. The $12=20
million of  funding in the Pennsylvania Wind Development Program is a drop =
in=20
the bucket  compared to the billions of dollars that subsidize nuclear powe=
r=20
plants.=20
?
Another challenge to new wind power is that the exploding demand for wind =
=20
turbines throughout the world and the rush to build American wind farms by =
=20
December 2001 are stressing the capacity of turbine manufacturers to meet =
=20
orders. Only five qualified wind manufacturers do business in the U.S. Of=
=20
the  five, two are taking no new orders through 2001, while two others have=
=20
limited  capacity remaining for additional orders. The leading manufacturer=
s=20
are  unfortunately not American but European =01* many are just beginning t=
o=20
have enough  business in the U.S., and Pennsylvania in particular, to=20
support? necessary  sales and operating support.=20
?
If turbines are available to harvest the wind, Pennsylvania=01,s wind resou=
rce =20
is sufficient for commercial development, but does not generate as much or=
=20
as  valuable electricity as in other states. For example, some states may=
=20
have Class  5 wind that blows strong and steady during peak electric load=
=20
times. The best  sites in Pennsylvania are only Class 4, and the wind often=
=20
blows intermittently.  In addition to the lower average price for the=20
electricity generated at off-peak  times, the resource at a site is crucial=
=20
to project finances and requires  detailed assessment. A site generally mus=
t=20
be =01&metered=018 for a full year before  investors will make a commitment=
 to a=20
project.=20
?
Although there are no technical barriers to interconnection of wind =20
generation to the grids in Pennsylvania, the intermittent nature of wind=20
also  makes interconnection with a system based on predictable generation=
=20
more  difficult and less economic. For example, some operating systems stil=
l=20
have  rules that impose substantial penalties for inaccurate scheduling of=
=20
generation,  even though the real time balancing markets required under FER=
C=20
Order 2000  should eliminate the need for these penalties. The intermittent=
=20
nature of wind  makes such rules especially burdensome for wind projects.=
=20
?
On the bright side, some of the early problems with wind generation are =20
successfully being overcome. New wind turbines now purr along quietly=20
compared  to older technologies. New turbines also turn quite slowly and=20
developers are  sensitive to the rights of birds to fly. While wind turbine=
s=20
were once  considered eyesores, the sleek postmodern look is increasingly=
=20
found attractive,  especially in comparison to transmission lines, cell=20
towers, or the strip mining  that often occurred on the same land upon whic=
h=20
the turbines are now being  built.=20
?
Communities also are welcoming wind projects, not just because problems =20
related to noise, birds, or view sheds can be minimized, but as important=
=20
rural  economic development and supplementary income to farmers. A farmer c=
an=20
receive  rental income of about $2,700 per year per turbine erected on a ti=
ny=20
portion of  farmland without significant interference to farming operations=
.=20
A 15-turbine  wind farm could add $40,000 in annual income to a hard-presse=
d=20
small  farmer.
?
A rural township can also expect a boost in its tax base.  For example, whe=
n=20
the wind farm was built, the Garrett tax base increased about  100%. And,=
=20
local construction contracts comprise about 20% of the cost of a new  wind=
=20
development, so that a $15 million wind farm generates about $3 million. =
=20
Conservation Consultants=01, Wind Farm USA Project works in farming areas w=
ith=20
the  best wind development potential to help rural communities understand=
=20
the  economic as well as environmental benefits of new wind development.=20
?
Pennsylvania will never have the best wind resources, but the remaining =20
challenges facing its wind industry can readily be overcome. The federal =
=20
Production Tax Credit should be extended for several years, the Pennsylvani=
a =20
Wind Development Program should be expanded, and system operators should=20
correct  their rules in order to eliminate unnecessary barriers to the=20
development of our  burgeoning wind industry.=20
?
Ultimately, consumer demand may resolve these problems. If consumer demand =
=20
is strong enough, the manufacturers, markets, systems operators and others=
=20
will  find doing business in Pennsylvania wind to be just another day at th=
e=20
office,  or should we say, down on the farm.
