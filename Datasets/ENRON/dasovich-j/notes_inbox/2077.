> Attached is Commissioner Neeper's Ruling Requesting Comments on the FERC
> November 1 Order and the Section 390 Proceeding.  The Commissioner raised
> two questions:  (1) What to do with Phase I issues, given the potential
> changes to the market structure (e.g. elimination of PX buy/sell), and (2)
> how to modify his proposed decision in response to the FERC Order.

> A conference call is scheduled for 9:30 a.m. (PST) on Thursday, November
30.

> The call-in number is            888/476-3752
> The Participant Code is        111756

> Commissioner Neeper's Ruling asks for proposed solutions on how to
proceed.
> The Ruling may read to endorse aspects of the IEP proposed settlement,
> specifically delay Phase II until 2003 or beyond.  If this is the case,
the
> Commissioner's Ruling begs the question:  (1) how/what should voluntary
> switchers be paid for 2000; (2) how/what should voluntary switchers bepaid
> for 2001 and beyond; (3) how to treat losses for 2001.
>
> For discussion purposes, I propose the following questions for parties to
> consider prior to the conference call:
>
> How best to eliminate the regulatory uncertainty for voluntary switchers
> regarding what they will get paid.  How best to separate this issue from
the
> issue of "refunds" at the wholesale level?
>
> If the PX buy/sell provision is eliminated, what ought to be the
"PX-based"
> price for energy:  Neeper's proposal of the day-ahead PX price (which may
be
> highly volatile, a basket of market indices, or the price of cotton in
> China?
>
> Is it necessary to build a "bridge" for voluntary switchers to move back
to
> the SRAC formula.
