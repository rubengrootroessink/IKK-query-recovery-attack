Good afternoon:

Attached is today's energy paper.  Please note that this morning there was
new action on the SCE MOU.  Currently there is a meeting that began at 2:00
pm, room 127 of the State Capitol to discuss proposed changes in the SCE
MOU.  It is my understanding that all interested parties were invited.
Copies of the proposed bill were being distributed from the Speaker's
office. There are some indications that there maybe, and again I stress
maybe, session on Friday.  That question may not be answered until later
tonight or in the morning.

Also, the Governor will be signing the budget tomorrow.

Don't make summer plans just yet.
