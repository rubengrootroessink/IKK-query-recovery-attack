Subject: Phil Angelides Remarks


Phil Angelides addressed Town Hall Los Angeles last week about the energy
crisis.  Angelides was the first speaker in Town Hall's energy series.
Upcoming speakers include John Bryson, Steve Letbetter, Loretta Lynch, and
Ken Lay.

Angelides made the following comments regarding the energy crisis:

1.  A sharp downturn in California will send the national economy into a
slide
2.  California deregulation is a virus that will kill deregulation
nationally.
3.  The power shortage is a problem of our own making.
4.  Californians must conserve power in record-setting levels.
5.  The Governor and Legislator must level with citizens about the energy
crisis
6.  Utility rates must penalize consumption
7.  Californians must unite to reign in generators
8.  The Federal government should impose wholesale price caps
9.  If FERC will not fulfill its obligation to set fair and reasonable
prices, or the price of electricity
     increases 50% more, Californians must fend for themselves, possibly
through the formation of a
     buyers cartel with Oregon and Wash. or by seizing power plants.
