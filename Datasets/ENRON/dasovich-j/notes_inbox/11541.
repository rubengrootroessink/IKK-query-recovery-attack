Jeff,

Following up on yesterday's conversation, SBX1 31 did contain some expedited
review provisions for CPUC and DWR decisions and was chaptered into law on
May 10.  The first special session ended on or about May 15 which means the
expedited provisions take effect on or about August 15.  The intent of the
budget language was to have that take effect even sooner.

Scott
