Even so, the decision was criticized by commissioner Richard Bilas as a=20

by Gov. Gray Davis.=20
"Every consumer in California is justified in feeling outrage at the rates =

inaction by federal regulators.=20
Lynch said the new rates will fuel conservation, but business interests hav=

Under Tuesday's decision, agricultural rate hikes were capped at 15 percent=
=20
to 20 percent, partly in response to Davis' urgings.=20
The governor, who had urged the commission to go easier on agriculture and=

"modest improvements" over earlier proposals but "my plan represented a mor=

An energy council expects five times the outages forecast
By Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writer
(Published May 16, 2001)=20
In the bleakest assessment yet of California's summertime energy shortage, =
an=20
industry association Tuesday predicted the state will suffer five times as=
=20
many rolling blackouts as previously forecast.=20
Moreover, the group said the blackouts will be twice as widespread --=20
affecting twice as many Californians at a time -- as any the state has=20
experienced this year.=20
The North American Electric Reliability Council predicted 15 hours of=20
blackouts a week through September, vs. about three hours under assumptions=
=20
released by the Independent System Operator, which runs California's power=
=20
grid. The council's prediction sharply contrasted with predictions by Gov.=
=20
Gray Davis, who has said the state will avoid major problems this summer.=
=20
"All indications are, there are going to be chronic problems this summer,"=
=20
said Tim Gallagher, manager of technical services at the reliability counci=
l.=20
He said Californians for the first time can expect blackouts during odd hou=
rs=20
and on weekends, instead of just the late-afternoon hours when electricity=
=20
consumption usually peaks.=20
A Princeton, N.J., nonprofit group funded by the energy industry and=20
dedicated to monitoring the nation's power supplies, the reliability counci=
l=20
said electricity supplies may be iffy this summer in the Pacific Northwest,=
=20
New York, New England and Texas. The only state where it predicted blackout=
s=20
was California.=20
Taking note of the ISO's study, the council was far more pessimistic about=
=20
the levels of available power this summer from California's existing=20
hydroelectric, nuclear and natural gas-fired generating plants. It also=20
predicted fewer imports from out of state and said California will get less=
=20
power than expected from the host of new power plants scheduled to begin=20
operation over the summer.=20
The council did say the demand for power is likely to be less than the ISO=
=20
estimated, thanks to the impact of conservation programs and a hefty rate=
=20
increase approved by the Public Utilities Commission. But the council said=
=20
conservation programs are likely to generate only a third of the savings=20
predicted by state officials.=20
California has experienced six days of rolling blackouts this year, includi=
ng=20
two last week, the result of hydropower shortages, unexpected plant shutdow=
ns=20
and the financial crisis facing the state's two main utilities, Pacific Gas=
=20
and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison.=20
The second blackout, on Jan. 18, was the most widespread, cutting power to=
=20
750,000 homes at a time.=20
The reliability council said the average blackout this summer will be twice=
=20
as bad, taking down 1.6 million homes at a time.=20
Predicting the impact of summertime blackouts has become something of a=20
cottage industry, with various independent consultants forecasting billions=
=20
in economic losses. Recently a consultant hired by top business lobbyists=
=20
said the state will lose 135,000 jobs if it suffers 110 hours of blackouts =
--=20
less than half as many hours as predicted by the reliability council, which=
=20
is owned by 10 Regional Reliability Councils whose members come from all=20
segments of the electric industry.=20
The effect on the business climate remains to be seen. "We really have no=
=20
experience with this," said chief economist Ted Gibson of the California=20
Department of Finance.=20
Various industry analysts have predicted anywhere from 20 to 36 days of=20
rolling blackouts this summer. The ISO has said the state could face=20
blackouts any day when total demand exceeds 40,000 megawatts, which happene=
d=20
34 times last summer.=20
The ISO, which is scheduled to update its summer forecast next week, didn't=
=20
predict the number of hours of blackouts. But the reliability council fed=
=20
ISO's assumptions into its computer model and came up with 55 hours of=20
blackouts this summer. Using its own, more pessimistic assumptions, the=20
council estimated 260 hours, or about 15 hours a week.=20
"It wouldn't shock me," said Severin Borenstein of the University of=20
California Energy Institute. "It's a little high, compared to the other=20
estimates, but there's a lot of uncertainty about what's going to be=20
available in state and out of state."=20
The ISO had no comment on the council's projections, but Davis' office said=
=20
the forecast is overly pessimistic.=20
"Their calculations are based on the worst conditions occurring all day,=20
every day," said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio.=20
He said the council overlooks the expected supplies from new "peaker" power=
=20
plants and two Orange County plants that will fire up this summer after fiv=
e=20
years in mothballs. The report also underestimates the level of power that=
=20
neighboring states will sell to California, he said.=20
"They assume it's going to be blazing hot in Phoenix, Portland and San=20
Francisco all on the same day (drastically reducing imports), and that neve=
r=20
happens," Maviglio said.=20
Davis has tried recently to minimize the impact of blackouts, saying: "We'l=
l=20
get through the summer without major disruptions. A couple of difficult day=
s,=20
but no major disruptions."=20
The council and the ISO are far apart in their assessment of supplies. The=
=20
ISO, for instance, predicted that the state will get nearly 2,600 additiona=
l=20
megawatts of power by July from new plants under construction, enough=20
electricity for nearly 2 million homes. The council said new plants typical=
ly=20
don't operate at full efficiency when they're starting up. Its prediction:=
=20
500 megawatts, or enough for only 375,000 homes.=20
Similarly, the ISO said the drought will curtail hydro supplies by 1,000=20
megawatts. The council said the shortfall will reach 2,400 megawatts by=20
August.=20
And while the ISO figured unexpected plant shutdowns will erase 2,500=20
megawatts of power, the council predicted the damage will be more than 4,50=
0=20
megawatts.=20

Generator, environmental groups strike deal=20

(Published May 16, 2001)=20
Days after state regulators gave Duke Energy the go-ahead to expand its Mos=

Landing Power Plant near Monterey Bay last fall, documents show four=20
environmental groups made their own deal with the utility giant.=20
The four signed an agreement not to "participate in any lawsuit (or)=20

=20
financial concession: $1 million from Duke for environmental "monitoring an=
d=20

Balancing power generation and environmental protection always has been=20
difficult. But today, as power-starved California scrambles to find and=20

money can sway even environmentalists -- and tip the scales too far in favo=
r=20

Environmentalists who signed the agreement, though, said that despite their=

concerns about the plant expansion, they had little chance of stopping it,=
=20
especially after it was approved by the California Energy Commission and=20
Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board.=20
So they took the potentially controversial step: entering into an agreement=

with Duke for financial resources to pay for studies of the plant's impact =

Other environmentalists, though, criticized that approach.=20

"It is very disheartening," said Carolyn Nielson, a retired teacher who alo=

"These environmental groups have the expertise, the biologists, the=20

Such criticisms are off-base, according to Warner Chabot, regional director=

for the Center for Marine Conservation, a national environmental group that=

was among those to sign the deal. He said environmentalists got the best de=

"Look at what's happening with power plant approvals in California right=20
now," said Chabot, referring to the state's push to bring new energy source=

The Moss Landing project -- which is scheduled to add 1,060 megawatts in=20
2002, enough to serve one million homes -- is a key part of that energy=20
expansion plan.=20
No money will go to the four environmental groups -- the Center for Marine=

Otter Project. It will be routed, in five yearly installments of $200,000=
=20
each, to the Monterey Bay Sanctuary Foundation, a nonprofit organization th=
at=20
helps support sanctuary programs, including scientific research.=20
Chabot helped found the sanctuary foundation and sits on its board. He said=
=20
the money will be used to monitor the health of Elkhorn Slough, a=20
biologically rich estuary that borders the plant and is linked to Monterey=
=20
Bay.=20
"Not a dime comes to the Center for Marine Conservation," he said. "Not a=
=20
penny comes to me."=20
Duke representatives said the controversy about the arrangement has been=20
stirred by a handful of people.=20
"It's a million dollars worth of water quality studies," said Duke spokesma=
n=20
Tom Williams. "Our whole effort wasn't to try to buy anybody off. It was=20

Madeline Clark, a local businesswoman and founder of Monterey Parkway -- a=

"You know what bothers me?" Clark said. "Environmental groups get tons of=

natural gas-fired electrical capacity to the Moss Landing plant, purchased=

If the expansion is finished next year, as scheduled, it would account for=

"This is a big deal," said Williams, the Duke spokesman. "It will be the=20

Opponents say it's not the power they oppose, but the plant's cooling syste=

Landing Harbor. Such pumping, they say, will degrade Elkhorn Slough. They=

argue for an alternative cooling system, such as towers that recirculate=20

"Basically, what that plant will do is take 25 percent of the volume of the=

(Published May 16, 2001)=20
California's historic -- and terribly flawed -- experiment in the generatio=

tale of political intrigue.=20
During late 2000 and early 2001, business leaders, worried that the utiliti=

How that came about is still a bit mysterious. Davis acted after the state=

Edison, PG&E customers hit hard by state action

In the preview of a movie SDG&E customers don't want to see, the state Publ=
ic=20
Utilities Commission walloped customers of California's other major utiliti=
es=20
with electricity rate increases as high as 50 percent yesterday.=20
The historic increases follow a PUC decision in March to raise electricity=
=20
bills for Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison customers=
=20
by a total $5.2 billion annually.=20
That decision, however, did not specify how the increase would be allocated=
.=20

Yesterday's vote ordered rate increases of up to 37 percent for residential=
=20
customers and up to 49.5 percent for business customers. The 3-2 vote drew=

howls of protest from demonstrators at the commission's San Francisco=20

Similar increases are expected for San Diego Gas and Electric's 1.2 million=

Although yesterday's rate increase allocation was stunning, commission=20
President Loretta Lynch warned of worse increases ahead unless the Federal=

"Unless and until the FERC decides to enforce the law, even these=20
astronomical new average rates may prove inadequate to cover exorbitant=20
wholesale electricity prices in the California market," Lynch wrote in the=
=20
approved rate increase decision.=20
The PUC was pressed to raise rates in order to cover California's cost of=
=20
purchasing electricity. The state took over purchasing power earlier this=
=20
year as utilities moved toward insolvency.=20
The utilities said that with customer payments frozen under terms of the=20
state's deregulation law, they were unable to pay the soaring cost of=20
wholesale power. Critics noted the same utilities transferred billions in=
=20
payments to parent companies and shareholders during the first years of=20

The new increases for the 9 million customers of PG&E and Edison will begin=
=20
appearing in June bills but will be retroactive to March, when the rate=20
adjustment was approved.=20
Consumer groups said yesterday's vote was delayed by a day because of frant=
ic=20
lobbying by business interests seeking to shift a greater share of the new=
=20
costs onto residential ratepayers.=20
Mike Florio, senior attorney for The Utility Reform Network, the San=20
Francisco-based consumer group, calculated that last-minute lobbying by=20
businesses advocates pushed about $105 million more of the increase onto=20
residential customers, compared to an earlier version of the rate increase=
=20
allocation, which was also written by Lynch.=20
"This decision shows how desperately we need control over our electric syst=
em=20
and how costly deregulation has become for California," Florio said.=20
Demonstrators at the PUC session yesterday suggested the commission is=20
failing to protect the public and should henceforth be called the "Private=
=20
Utilities Commission." Others issued calls for seizing power plants.=20
Commissioner Geoffrey Brown shouted back at protesters that rate increases=
=20
were necessary.=20
Under the rate design approved yesterday, homeowners able to keep electrici=
ty=20
use within 130 percent of the so-called baseline allowance will be spared=

conditions. The baseline is a minimum level of electricity, and it varies b=
y=20
location. The baseline amount, measured in kilowatt-hours, is printed on=20

The Office of Ratepayer Advocates within the commission estimates these=20

?????SAN FRANCISCO--Voicing fears for the health of California's economy, t=
he=20
state's chief utility regulator Tuesday shifted some of a $5.7-billion rate=
=20
increase away from agricultural and industrial customers and placed it on=
=20
millions of residential customers, whose bills will rise $4 to $85 a month.
?????A sharply divided California Public Utilities Commission voted 3 to 2 =
to=20
approve a plan that will fundamentally change how customers of the state's=
=20
biggest utilities will pay for power. The rates are designed to reward thos=
e=20
who conserve and to punish those who don't.
?????The rate increase will begin appearing in June bills and is retroactiv=
e=20
to March 27, when the commission approved an average hike of 3 cents a=20
kilowatt-hour.
?????"Every consumer in California is justified in feeling outrage at the=
=20
rates we approve today and the bills they will have to pay tomorrow," said=
=20
the commission decision. "We share the sense of outrage."
?????Consumer groups accused the PUC of bowing to political pressure from=
=20
business interests. And business groups, which lobbied hard in recent days =
to=20
soften the hit to industry, said the PUC did not go far enough to protect t=
he=20
state's economy.
?????The plan by PUC President Loretta Lynch was revised after the governor=
=20
openly criticized it and industry leaders mounted a fierce public relations=
=20
attack.
?????The final version covering 9 million Southern California Edison and=20
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. customers called for the following:
?????* Average residential rates will rise by 47% for Edison customers who=
=20
use more than 130% of their baseline, the amount deemed necessary to meet t=
he=20
needs of a typical household. PG&E customers will experience a 55% increase=
.=20
The top rate for the heaviest users will rise 71% for Edison customers and=
=20
80% for those of PG&E. The two companies together have nearly 751,000 such=
=20
customers.
?????* A new five-tier system will be instituted for residential customers,=
=20
with rates rising as usage rises. The average bills rise less than the=20
average rates because the new rates affect only a portion of the bill.
?????* Industrial customers will see an average rate increase of 49%, which=
=20
is only slightly lower than Lynch's original proposal. But the PUC capped t=
he=20
average rates at 12.9 cents per kilowatt-hour for industrial customers of=
=20
Edison and 12.3 cents for PG&E. The cap would limit increases for some=20
industrial customers, but it was unclear Tuesday how it would be applied.
?????* In response to Democratic Gov. Gray Davis' urgings, rate increases f=
or=20
agricultural interests were capped at 15% to 20%, the smallest overall=20
increase among the customer groups.
?????* Small-business customers will see their rates rise by about 35%.
?????* Customers who use less than 130% of baseline, low-income customers a=
nd=20
people with special medical needs will have no increase.
?????The commission acted to help the state pay for the soaring price of=20
wholesale electricity. Under the deregulation of California's electricity=
=20
industry, the utilities were barred from passing along high electricity cos=
ts=20
charged by independent generators. In the process, PG&E and Edison were=20
pounded by debt, and the state was forced in mid-January to buy electricity=
=20
on their behalf.
?????The commission acknowledged that more rate increases may be necessary=
=20
unless federal regulators find a way to control the wholesale electricity=
=20
market.
?????In the six weeks after the rate increase was approved, the panel held=
=20
hearings and designed the rate structure--a process that normally takes at=
=20
least six months. A vote on the rate design was scheduled for Monday, but i=
t=20
was postponed for a day to allow commissioners to review revisions that Lyn=
ch=20
made to her proposal over the weekend.
?????By approving Lynch's plan, the commission rejected one proposed by a P=
UC=20
administrative law judge who conducted the hearings. That proposal would ha=
ve=20
resulted in lower rates for residential customers and higher rates for all=
=20
classes of business than the Lynch version.
?????The two dissenting votes were cast by Commissioners Edward Bilas and=
=20
Henry Duque, both appointees of former Republican Gov. Pete Wilson.
?????Duque criticized the plan for "favoring some customers while punishing=
=20
others. . . . Today's decision asks small businesses and some residential=
=20
customers to subsidize others. Subsidized consumption leads to more=20
consumption, not conservation."
?????Bilas said: "This crippling rate increase would have a ripple effect"=
=20
through California's economy and could drive out business.
?????"What we have here is an economic recipe for disaster," said Bilas.
?????Commissioner Geoffrey F. Brown, a Davis appointee, tried to negotiate=
=20
more favorable treatment of industry after recently speaking with Bilas and=
=20
the governor's office. Lynch made some changes that reduced the rate increa=
se=20
for industry slightly, to about 49% on average. Brown had hoped to lower th=
e=20
increase to about 43%.
?????At the meeting Brown said he had "great hesitancy" about some of the=
=20
rates in Lynch's proposal but would back it.
?????"At the end of the day we need to raise the money to meet the electric=
al=20
needs of California," he said. "We cannot walk away from it. We cannot put=
=20
our heads in the sand.
?????"California now has the opportunity in this time of crisis to conserve=
,=20
to break the fever, to beat back the looters."
?????Protesters interrupted Brown and Commissioner Carl Wood, crying, "Seiz=
e=20
the plants! The governor has the power." One demonstrator was ejected by=20
California Highway Patrol officers.
?????The Utility Reform Network accused the commission of caving in to=20
business interests and said the revisions in Lynch's plan added more than=
=20
$100 million to the amount to be paid by residential customers.
?????"They put too much of the increase on the residential customers," said=
=20
Mike Florio, senior attorney for the group.
?????After the hearing, Brown went face-to-face with Florio in the building=
=20
courtyard. He said the amount shifted from industry to residential customer=
s=20
was closer to $40 million and he angrily denied that industry influenced hi=
s=20
vote.
?????Edison is still assessing how the rates would affect customer bills,=
=20
said Akbar Jazayeri, director of revenue and tariffs. He noted that the new=
=20
rates will apply only to the usage in each tier, not to the entire bill.
?????"It doesn't mean because your usage is 1,000 kilowatt-hours that your=
=20
entire bill will be charged at the highest rate," Jazayeri said.
?????The PUC estimated that the average monthly Edison residential bill wil=
l=20
rise between $4, or 6%, and $71, or 37%, depending on usage. The average=20
monthly PG&E residential bill will increase between $5 and $85, the PUC sai=
d.
?????The Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights estimated that the=20
average monthly household electricity bill will increase by $36 in Edison=

territory and $39 in PG&E territory.
?????"Once again, residential and small-business ratepayers, the innocent=
=20
victims of deregulation, are being forced to pay the price for the=20
deregulation debacle, while the special interests that foisted deregulation=
=20
upon us get off easy," said Doug Heller, consumer advocate for the Santa=20
Monica-based group.
?????But business interests also were unhappy with the PUC rate decision.
?????"We're still up in the 50% range for industrial users," said Jack=20
Stewart, head of the California Manufacturers and Technology Assn. "It is=

?????The manufacturers along with such influential organizations as the=20

commercial and industrial users.
?????"There is no issue that I have hit on harder with the governor's offic=

State Has Lost Global Lead in 'Green' Power=20
Electricity: As the crisis worsens, California has been overtaken on solar=
=20
and wind energy. Still, alternative producers remain key players.=20

By MITCHELL LANDSBERG, Times Staff Writer=20

?????A quarter of a century ago, California stood at the vanguard in the=20
development of alternative energy worldwide. With Gov. Jerry Brown lighting=
=20
the way--and enduring no small measure of ridicule for doing so--the state=
=20
took the lead in finding ways to coax electricity from the sun and wind,=20
underground steam and agricultural waste.
?????Today, as the state struggles with the worst electricity crisis in its=
=20
history, it is no longer the global leader in exploiting what loosely falls=
=20
under the rubric of "green" energy.
?????Japan now generates more than 15 times as much electricity from solar=
=20
energy as does California, despite having about half the usable sunlight.=
=20
Germany produces more than triple the wind energy.
?????And although California remains the undisputed U.S. leader in=20
alternative energy production, Texas, home of the American oil industry, is=
=20
among several states threatening to supplant its leadership by mandating th=
e=20
rapid growth of renewable power generation over the next decade.
?????Not that renewable energy has become irrelevant in California.
?????The state, in its moment of crisis, is counting on alternative=20
power--the most reliable and cheapest source of power--as never before.=20
Without the megawatts these producers pump into the grid, the odds of=20
blackouts would be even higher and the pressure to raise rates even greater=
.
?????Moreover, renewable energy producers now hold immense financial power=
=20
over the fate of the state's second-largest utility, Southern California=20
Edison. At any time, they could drag Edison into Bankruptcy Court--and have=
=20
threatened to do so--if it doesn't pay them the $500 million it owes for pa=
st=20
deliveries of electricity.
?????With their costs vastly surpassing their income, some producers have=
=20
simply shut down, draining precious megawatts from the grid. A spokeswoman=
=20
for the California Independent System Operator, which oversees the state's=
=20
power network, pegged the reduction in output by small producers Tuesday at=
=20
1,400 megawatts. About half that shortfall, she said, was due to payment=20
problems.
?????The situation has grown so severe that today the Federal Energy=20
Regulatory Commission is holding a hearing on whether to order the renewabl=
e=20
power generators back on line.
?????Leaders in the alternative energy industry--which has grown from its=
=20
techno-hippie roots to become the province of large, mainstream=20
corporations--say they are optimistic that their future will be brighter.=
=20
Eventually, they are certain, renewable energy sources will become=20
mainstream; fossil fuels--oil, coal and natural gas--will become, once agai=
n,=20
fossils.
?????And yet, for all that, here's the harsh reality: For the past decade,=
=20
alternative energy has played a shrinking role in the state's overall=20
electricity mix, and that is almost certain to accelerate as the state=20
rebounds from its crisis the old-fashioned way, by building more power plan=
ts=20
that convert fossil fuels into electricity.
?????Many in the utility industry argue that there is no choice. Most=20
alternative energy sources remain too expensive or inconvenient to play a=
=20
major role in the state's power mix now, they say.
?????In fact, leaving aside hydroelectric power, which fluctuates widely=20
during drought and flood cycles, the production of renewable energy in=20
California actually declined slightly between 1990 and 1999. During the sam=
e=20
period, the use of fossil fuels for electricity increased substantially.
?????With 13 new, conventional power plants licensed but not yet completed,=
=20
it seems certain that renewable sources of energy will provide a still=20
smaller percentage of the state's power in the next few years.
?????Those who have championed alternative energy for the past three decade=
s=20
rue the opportunity that could be lost.
?????"This state and its ratepayers invested heavily in renewable energy=20
technologies," said Hal Harvey, president of the Energy Foundation, a=20
nonprofit organization dedicated to encouraging sustainable energy.
?????"We paid a premium for that, but we succeeded in making these=20
technologies five, six, 10 times cheaper than they were. . . . Ironically,=
=20
this state paid for that revolution but is not taking advantage of it."
?????If anyone needed a reminder of how far California has come in its=20
development of alternative power--and the consequences of failing to keep u=
p=20
that investment--it came in March, when alternative energy generators began=
=20
to close their plants after enduring months of missed payments by the=20
financially strapped utility companies.
?????Although the state government had spent billions picking up the=20
utilities' tab for conventional power, it too had balked at paying the smal=
l=20
alternative producers.
?????The result: the first deliberate statewide blackouts since World War I=
I.

?????A Small Step Taken in 1976
?????On May 21, 1976, a small item appeared on the back pages of the Los=20
Angeles Times.
?????"Homeowners and businesses can earn state tax credits of up to $1,000=
=20
for purchases of solar energy equipment under a bill signed by Gov. Brown,"=
=20
it said. It went on to quote the governor as saying: "It was a small step,=
=20
but it was an important step."
?????He might have added that it would be little noted nor long remembered.
?????Yet that small step helped nurture a budding interest in alternative=
=20
energy in California, whose native tinkerers were just then exploring ways =
of=20
reducing their reliance on the traditional electricity grid, then powered=
=20
primarily by oil, large hydroelectric plants and nuclear power.
?????Ross Burkhardt was typical. An electrician by training and a hippie by=
=20
inclination, he was living in a tepee in the hills of Mendocino County in t=
he=20
late 1970s when he and many of his friends began looking for cleaner forms =
of=20
power. Burkhardt was among those who had migrated to the rural counties nor=
th=20
of San Francisco in the hope of living a simpler, more independent=20
life--which meant, for a time, life without electricity.
?????Life without power turned out to be a bit of a drag. For one thing, it=
=20
meant life without a stereo. Burkhardt and others began stringing wires to=
=20
the batteries of their cars, trucks and vans to power their tunes and light=
s.=20
That worked for a while, until people started getting up in the morning to=
=20
find their car batteries stone dead.
?????In about 1978, Burkhardt had had enough. "I decided to make a windmill=
=20
one day," he recalled. He bought an old computer tape drive motor for $20 a=
t=20
a junk shop and turned it into a generator. He used a knife to carve a=20
42-inch-long 2-by-4 into a blade, then mounted the blade and motor on a pol=
e.=20
Then he hooked up the whole mess to a truck battery.
?????Eureka! When the wind blew, the windmill turned, generating electricit=
y=20
that was fed into the battery. He was creating enough power to keep his tep=
ee=20
lighted and his stereo cranking, and he wasn't damming any rivers or=20
splitting any atoms or polluting the air. And there was a bonus, Burkhardt=
=20
said: "It was all free!"
?????Burkhardt would later move into a somewhat more permanent home and tak=
e=20
advantage of Brown-era tax credits to buy solar panels that he is still=20
using. Others were doing the same thing and creating ever more sophisticate=
d=20
technology to maintain life off the electrical grid.
?????And the state itself was investing heavily in alternative energy. In=
=20
Brown's first term, California allocated $23.7 million to demonstrate the=
=20
efficiency of solar, wind, geothermal, cogeneration and small hydroelectric=
=20
generation. By 1980, renewable and alternative sources made up 5% of the=20
state's electricity generation.
?????At the same time, the federal government, still reeling from the Arab=
=20
oil embargo, was developing its own alternative energy policies. A federal=
=20
law passed in 1978 required utilities to buy energy from any qualified=20
alternative producer.
?????How much to pay for alternative energy has always been an issue. Becau=
se=20
the "fuel"--the sun, wind, geothermal springs--is essentially free, most or=
=20
all the expense is in upfront equipment purchases, which can vary based on=
=20
the method of financing.
?????"You're basically prepaying your utility bill for 25 years," said Kevi=
n=20
Best, director of sales and marketing for RealEnergy, a company that develo=
ps=20
electricity generation plants--renewable and conventional--for large real=
=20
estate developments.
?????The 1978 law got around the problem by declaring that utilities wouldn=
't=20
pay for alternative energy based on the actual cost, but based on the=20
utility's avoided cost--in other words, the money the utility would have=20
spent had it bought the energy from conventional sources.
?????In 1980, Ronald Reagan was elected president. In 1982, George Deukmeji=
an=20
was elected governor of California. Their Republican administrations were=
=20
considerably less enamored of alternative energy than those of their=20
Democratic predecessors.
?????About the same time, the price of oil and natural gas began to drop.=
=20
Interest in energy alternatives sank with it. Natural gas was not only much=
=20
cleaner than coal, it was practically cheaper than air. Why mess with=20
alternatives?
?????"All of those energy concerns just dropped off the radar screens," sai=
d=20
Richard Worthington, a professor of politics at Pomona College who follows=
=20
energy policy.

?????9% Comes From 'Green' Sources
?????Twenty years later, California has nevertheless made major strides in=
=20
developing alternative energy. The state now obtains about 9% of its power=
=20
from "green" sources, not counting the 15% that comes from hydroelectric=20
plants. Taken together, they account for about one-quarter of the state's=
=20
power.
?????Yet advocates of renewable power say California could have done much=
=20
more. In a state blessed with abundant sun, wind and geothermal resources,=
=20
they say, the current crisis could have been avoided altogether with smart=
=20
green development.
?????The Japanese, Germans and Danes, among others, have vastly increased=
=20
their use of renewable energy by heavily subsidizing solar and wind energy=
=20
production, and by taxing fossil fuel plants on the theory that the polluti=
on=20
they emit carries a cost to society.
?????Americans tend to view such policies as heavy-handed--even antithetica=
l=20
to a free market economy. But some also argue that there has been a bias=20
within the utility industry against small, clean energy systems.
?????"I think engineers like to build big, complicated power plants," said=
=20
Angelina Galiteva, director of strategic planning for the Los Angeles=20
Department of Water and Power.
?????It's also true that even as the prices of alternative forms of=20
electricity dropped, they remained well above the cost of burning natural g=
as.
?????Until last year.
?????In January 2000, wholesale electricity was averaging about 3 cents a=
=20
kilowatt-hour. By January 2001, soaring natural gas costs had sent those=20
prices up to more than 30 cents a kilowatt-hour.
?????There is general agreement that wind power now costs about 5 cents a=
=20
kilowatt-hour--and will continue to drop. Estimates of geothermal costs ran=
ge=20
from less than 5 cents to 7 to 10 cents a kilowatt-hour. Biomass--the burni=
ng=20
of wood chips, agricultural waste and the like--is probably about 8 to 10=
=20
cents a kilowatt-hour, and solar thermal energy--which uses mirrors to=20
concentrate the sun's heat to drive turbines--costs 10 to 15 cents.
?????Even the most expensive form of renewable energy, that produced by=20
rooftop panels of photovoltaic solar cells, has suddenly become competitive=
.=20
Estimates of the cost of photovoltaic energy range the widest--from as high=
=20
as 30 cents or more per kilowatt-hour to 10 cents or less after available=
=20
state and local subsidies.
?????But only in the worst-case scenario--someone buys the Cadillac of sola=
r=20
systems, takes out a high-interest loan and mounts the panels in a fogbound=
=20
district of San Francisco--does solar energy exceed the current price of=20
off-the-grid, gas-fired electricity.
?????Most energy experts expect that to change. Natural gas prices, they sa=
y,=20
can't stay at their current levels. Still, most renewable producers say the=
=20
future looks rosy--if they can survive their months of nonpayment by the=20
utilities. The price of solar and wind energy, in particular, is dropping=
=20
every year, and could remain competitive even if natural gas prices do fall=
.
?????Galiteva, among others, sees solar energy as a future mainstay. The DW=
P=20
has been aggressively promoting solar power, offering to heavily subsidize=

the cost of residential solar units and generating its own solar electricit=

from collectors throughout the city.
?????"It's the technology of the future," Galiteva said. "I like to think=

we're sitting on the cusp of a revolution and we just don't know it yet."

A One-Two Punch in the Budget=20
Economy: Tech dive and energy crisis hurt bond ratings again. Analysts say=

it's likely to get worse.=20

By MIGUEL BUSTILLO and DEBORA VRANA, Times Staff Writers=20

?????A perfect storm is brewing over California: A downturn in the state's=

once-bountiful state budget a shambles.
?????The cascade of tax revenues from stock options that caused the budget =

balloon in recent years has begun to dry up as the New Economy falters. At=
=20
the same time, the energy crisis is forcing the state to spend billions=20
buying electricity to avoid crippling mass blackouts.
?????The latest bad news came Tuesday, when Moody's Investors Service becam=
e=20
the second major credit rating firm to downgrade $25 billion in state bonds=
,=20
sounding an alarm over the "increasing financial risks associated with the=

continuing energy crisis."
?????The downgrades not only add millions to the state's borrowing costs,=
=20
including projects in the next state budget, they further complicate a=20
troubled plan to float a record $13.4 billion in bonds to repay state coffe=
rs=20
for electricity purchases.
?????The move by Moody's came one day after Gov. Gray Davis announced that =
he=20
was dipping into the state's emergency reserve fund to finance a pared-down=
=20
budget for the fiscal year that begins in July. Already, a statewide sales=
=20
tax holiday has been canceled and $300 million in aid to local governments=
=20
has been deleted from the budget.
?????The spiraling events contributed to a financial picture that looks=20
increasingly bleak, according to analysts. With the long, hot summer loomin=
g,=20
it only figures to get worse, potentially developing into the worst fiscal=
=20
crisis the state has faced since the economic recession of the early 1990s.
?????"It's almost a Kafkaesque situation we find ourselves in," said state=
=20
Treasurer Phil Angelides. "California is the leading edge of the national=
=20
economy, which is the leading world economy. We have to take these current=
=20
problems with a grain of salt. But without a doubt, these downgrades are a=
=20
black mark that threatens to harm the state's reputation."
?????After years of worrying about little more than how best to spend surpl=
us=20
billions, Gov. Gray Davis is now faced with his first tough budget battle.=
=20
And his initial response--draining emergency reserves rather than slashing=
=20
government spending--has raised eyebrows in Sacramento and on Wall Street.
?????Despite a pervasive aura of negativity, however, veteran state budget=
=20
officials profess optimism.
?????"Clearly, the revenue outlook has deteriorated," said Elizabeth Hill,=
=20
the state's nonpartisan legislative analyst. But compared to the budget=20
deficits of the past decade, Hill said, the current situation is still with=
in=20
control.
?????"Most of us have lived though the $14-billion budget shortfall," she=
=20
said, referring to the 1990-91 budget season, when then-Gov. Pete Wilson wa=
s=20
forced to slash programs. "So we have seen us overcome serious economic=20
problems in the past."
?????Experts on the outside, however, were taking a more negative view. In=
=20
explaining its downgrade, Moody's said it was particularly concerned that=
=20
California had recently backed out on a $4-billion loan to reimburse the=20
budget for electricity purchases until bonds could be floated, and that the=
=20
bond sale had been delayed until August.
?????It was also concerned about the general decline in the state and=20
national economies, and Davis' plan to maintain only a minimal $1-billion=
=20
reserve, the firm said. Moody's action came less than a month after Standar=
d=20
& Poor's lowered its rating on California bonds two notches.
?????The downgrade registered virtually no response on Wall Street on=20
Tuesday, in part because many bond traders and analysts have already reacte=
d=20
to California's energy woes and actually expected a harsher action from=20
Moody's. The firm lowered the rating on $19.8 billion of general obligation=
=20
bonds from AA2 to AA3. The ratings on $5.7 billion in lease revenue bonds w=
as=20
dropped from AA3 to A1.
?????In general, the lower the rating, the higher the interest the state mu=
st=20
pay those who buy its bonds. Thus, the downgrade threatens to increase the=
=20
price tag for state projects, such as $400 million in higher education bond=
s=20
Davis had proposed in his new budget.
?????"If anything, the market was surprised that Moody's was so kind," said=
=20
Bob Gore, a managing director and bond trader at Crowell Weedon & Co. in Lo=
s=20
Angeles. "I thought they'd take [the state] down to at least a single-A."
?????But it sparked a heated round of finger-pointing in Sacramento, with=
=20
Davis and other Democrats accusing Republicans of causing the state's credi=
t=20
rating to slip by blocking the loan deal last week.
?????The GOP legislators attempted to force Davis into a new strategy on th=
e=20
energy crisis by holding up a bill needed to secure the loan and sell the=
=20
bonds. But Davis refused and the Democratic-led Legislature passed a=20
majority-only bill instead.
?????"Last week, when Republican legislators decided to play politics and=
=20
block a vote on revenue bonds, I warned that their actions could have serio=
us=20
consequences," Davis said in a statement Tuesday. "Today, the seeds of=20
Republican obstructionism are bearing their ugly fruit."
?????Republicans, in turn, blamed the downgrade on Davis, calling it a=20
denunciation of his entire plan to finance a way out of the energy crisis.

260 Hours of Summer Blackouts Predicted=20
Forecasts: Industry group says assumptions made by Cal-ISO are overly=20
optimistic.=20

By RICHARD SIMON, Times Staff Writer=20

?????WASHINGTON--California will experience up to 260 hours of electrical=
=20
blackouts this summer, an industry group predicted Tuesday in one of the=20
gloomiest assessments of the state's energy crisis.
?????In announcing its bleak calculations, the North American Electric=20
Reliability Council said that many of the assumptions made by the agency th=
at=20
runs California's electrical transmission system appear overly optimistic.
?????That agency, the California Independent System Operator, has not made=
=20
any projections of the number of hours of blackouts. But it has said the=20
state could face 34 days this summer in which blackouts are possible,=20
assuming Californians use the same amount of electricity as they did last=
=20
summer.
?????The Princeton, N.J.-based reliability council said California is likel=
y=20
to fall 4,500 to 5,500 megawatts short of peak demand each month this summe=
r.=20
In other words, at the time of day when energy use is at its highest, the=
=20
state might not be able to serve the equivalent of about 3.75 million homes=
.
?????That is consistent with Cal-ISO's calculations of what could happen in=
=20
the worst of three possible scenarios for the summer but about 1,500=20
megawatts more than the agency's most likely scenario.
?????The newest projections are far more pessimistic than those issued=20
earlier this year by Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a=20
Massachusetts-based firm that predicted about 20 hours of blackouts this=20
summer. On the other end of the spectrum, Reliant Energy, a major owner of=
=20
power plants, has quoted consultants' projections that the state faces 1,10=
0=20
hours of blackouts during all of 2001.
?????The reliability council said the state could experience power=20
emergencies during non-peak periods as well as those of peak electricity us=
e.=20
The nonprofit corporation was formed after the 1965 blackouts in the=20
Northeast to promote electricity reliability.
?????In its 64-page assessment, the group questioned several assumptions ma=
de=20
by Cal-ISO and other analysts, including whether all of the anticipated new=
=20
electric generators will come into service in time.
?????"Since new generation requires a shakedown period during initial=20
start-up," the industry group said in its report, "it is unlikely that all =
of=20
the new generation will be on schedule and 100% available."
?????The council also projects that Californians will conserve less=20
electricity than state regulators hope--in part because of the newness of=
=20
rate increases and incentives designed to curb usage--and that the summer m=
ay=20
be warmer than normal.
?????A spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis disputed the forecast, saying it assum=
es=20
the worst.
?????"We are preparing for the worst and hoping for the best," said the=20
spokesman, Steve Maviglio.
?????He contended that the industry group underestimates the amount of=20
electricity expected to be available for purchase from the Northwest.
?????Cal-ISO spokeswoman Lorie O'Donley did not criticize the report=20
directly, saying that she did not know how its authors arrived at their=20
underlying assumptions. But she questioned the notion of forecasting=20
blackouts: "We don't think that's possible to do, given the variables that=

are in play."
?????The report cautions that New York City and New England should be close=

While Pacific Gas and Electric Co. was heading down the road to bankruptcy,=
=20
its board of directors was running to the bank with 36 percent salary hikes=
,=20
routine meeting bonuses and potentially lucrative stock options.=20
In 1997, a year after energy deregulation in California, PG&E's directors -=
-=20
16 at the time but since whittled to 10 -- gave themselves $8,000 pay hikes=
=20
even as the utility's finances began to spiral out of control.=20
The company's proxy statements show that the directors' $30,000 base salary=
=20
has stayed the same since, but the financial benefits of taking a seat in=
=20
PG&E's board room don't end there.=20
For each board or committee meeting, the directors get $1,000 bonuses just=
=20
for showing up -- and there have been as many as 29 meetings in a single=20
year.=20
In 1997 the amount of stock options available to each director was tripled,=
=20
from a limit of $10,000 to $30,000 per year.=20
It's all part of doing business in corporate America, experts say, especial=
ly=20
as a growing number of companies are governed by an ever-shrinking group of=
=20
people.=20
"You can make a career out of (being on boards)," said Paul Tiffany,=20
professor at Haas School of Business at the University of California at=20
Berkeley. "At an average of $50,000 per year (for each board position), you=
=20
can make a decent amount of money."=20
PG&E directors are no exception -- most of them also sit on boards of other=
=20
companies.=20
Eight of them also represent 30 different companies or organizations.=20
Many are San Francisco or Bay Area companies that have deep roots in the=20
region's economy.=20
"It is the secret geography of power in downtown San Francisco," said Gray=
=20
Brechin, an adjunct professor at UC-Berkeley who published a book on the=20
subject two years ago.=20
"These networks of power are like the roots of a forest that you walk over=
=20
every day. They are tangled together. . . . That's just how the financial=
=20
institutions work. And central to that is water and power," he said.=20
So it's not unusual to see overlap in executives or directors, he said.=20
According to PG&E records, lucrative contracts or money were given in 1996=
=20
and 1997 to Kaiser Permanente, $45.3 million; AirTouch Cellular, $2.5=20
million; Bank of America, $3.1 million; and Joint Venture: Silicon Valley=
=20
Network, which promotes South Bay businesses, $200,000.=20
PG&E director David Lawrence is chairman and chief executive officer of=20
Kaiser, while director C. Lee Cox was an executive at AirTouch at the time.=
=20
Director David Coulter was chairman and CEO of BofA. Rebecca Morgan was=20
president and CEO of Joint Venture while serving on the utility board in 19=
96=20
and 1997. She's not on the board now.=20
San Francisco law firm McCutchen, Doyle, Brown & Enersen also had a PG&E=20
contract; firm partner David Andrews joined the PG&E board last year.=20
None of the directors would comment, though PG&E spokesman Brian Hertzog sa=
id=20
the company has high standards for independence when it comes to board=20
members.=20
"These are relationships that are managed and formed as part of a regular=
=20
business at PG&E," he said. "They never reach the board level."=20
For example, the Kaiser contract is just one of several other health plan=
=20
options offered to PG&E employees, Hertzog said.=20
But a look at other companies that the directors represent reveals a who's=
=20
who of the region's powerful elite.=20
Andrews, 59, is also a board member at Union Bank.=20
Coulter, 53, is vice chairman of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., but more notably =
is=20
the former chairman and CEO of BofA, which merged with NationsBank in 1998.=
=20
The bank's headquarters was moved to Charlotte, N.C., and Coulter was later=

axed.=20
Cox, 59, is a longtime communications business executive who retired from=

AirTouch.=20
William Davila, 69, is the former president and the familiar TV face for=20
supermarket chain Vons, which was sold to Safeway for $2.5 billion in 1997.=
=20
He also sits on the boards of Home Depot and Hormel Foods.=20
Besides his Kaiser position, Lawrence, 60, also is a director at Agilent=20
Technologies, a Hewlett-Packard spin-off.=20
Mary Metz, 63, is president of the nonprofit S.H. Cowell Foundation, named=

after a San Francisco family.=20
Carl Reichardt, 69, is the retired chairman and CEO of Wells Fargo Bank.=20
Barry Lawson Williams, 56, is president of Williams Ventures in San Bruno.=

Gordon Smith, 53, is PG&E's chairman and CEO. Robert Glynn Jr., 58, holds t=

the board for PG&E, which is the utility. All but Smith are on the board fo=
r=20
the parent company.=20
PG&E Corp. trades on the New York Stock Exchange.=20
In most cases, both boards meet concurrently. Last year, there were 13=20
corporation board meetings and 10 utility board meetings.=20
Directors' terms are for one year, and shareholders can re-elect them at=20
their annual meeting.=20
The fact that directors belong to multiple boards means that they essential=
ly=20
work as the glue that binds the institutions together, experts say.=20
"It's all part of the modern corporate strategy," said Richard Walker,=20
regional economics professor at UC-Berkeley. "It cements relationships. . .=
 .=20
It ties the key businesses, which represents the guts of the (region's)=20
industries."=20
However, those ties could also be the companies' greatest weakness, he said=
.=20
It's a problem of like-minded people telling each other that all is well,=
=20
which can make some companies vulnerable to failure, Walker noted.=20
Also, today's corporate boards have a difficult time really knowing the=20
details of the business because their attention is divided among several=20
companies.=20
"Implicitly, you have some powerful people . . . you have people with acces=

When PG&E Corp. Chairman Robert Glynn takes the stage at San Francisco's=20
Masonic Auditorium today for the company's annual shareholder meeting, the=
=20
first thing he will do is wipe some egg off his face.=20
In his address to shareholders at the Masonic in 1998, Glynn had good news =
to=20
report about California's burgeoning efforts to deregulate the state's=20
electricity market.=20
"Electricity rates are down 10 percent from where they were a year ago," he=
=20
declared. "And they are going to stay down for several years, and then they=
=20
will go down again.=20
"There is no product bought on a daily basis that has such a predictable=20
downward price trajectory," Glynn said.=20
Today, three years after that disastrously wrong forecast, PG&E's utility=
=20
subsidiary, Pacific Gas and Electric Co., is in bankruptcy court attempting=
=20
to crawl out from beneath more than $9 billion in debt -- the result of=20
soaring power prices stemming from the same deregulation scheme Glynn had=
=20
once championed.=20
Still, it's a fairly safe bet that he won't beg shareholders for their=20
forgiveness.=20
"I am not uncomfortable looking back on the positions we took," Glynn told=
=20
Chronicle editors and writers recently when asked about his company's role =
in=20
drafting California's 1996 deregulation law.=20
He said PG&E placed its considerable weight behind deregulation efforts=20
because it was what customers wanted, and "we didn't want to be on the othe=
r=20
side of our customers."=20
In fact, few if any PG&E customers fully understood=20
the highly complex legislation that ultimately would make California's=20
electricity market the most dysfunctional in the nation.=20
Rather, as a close reading of Glynn's speeches in recent years reveals, he=
=20
viewed deregulation as a prime business opportunity that would allow PG&E t=
o=20
pay off past debts and expand its operations nationwide.=20
"In effect, we are trading our monopoly in half of one state for a wide- op=
en=20
market opportunity in all 50 states," he told the San Francisco Commonwealt=
h=20
Club in late 1997.=20
And in his address at PG&E's 1999 shareholder meeting, Glynn said he backed=
=20
deregulation "so that we could be solidly positioned to capture the economi=
c=20
benefits of this gigantic opening of the North American marketplace."=20
All that changed, of course, when California's wholesale electricity prices=
=20
spiked sharply higher last summer and the state's two largest utilities, PG=
&E=20
and Southern California Edison, rapidly found themselves teetering on the=
=20
brink of financial ruin.=20
Since then, numerous other states have halted or reversed their own=20
deregulation plans, and California's experiment -- in which PG&E was "a=20
leading force," according to Glynn -- is now universally held up as an obje=
ct=20
lesson in how not to restructure an electricity market.=20
To be sure, Glynn and PG&E are not solely to blame for California's current=
=20
troubles, and neither they nor anyone else could have anticipated the surge=
=20
in wholesale prices charged by out-of-state power companies.=20
"The whole structure of deregulation was put together poorly," said Douglas=
=20
Christopher, an energy-industry analyst at investment bank Crowell, Weedon =
&=20
Co. in Los Angeles. "People worked with what they could, but the whole thin=
g=20
was a mess."=20
At the same time, he said PG&E's management exacerbated the utility's=20
problems by not taking sufficient countermeasures until last December --=20
almost half a year after California's energy woes surfaced. "That's just=20
amazing," Christopher said.=20
In hindsight, it has become clear that Glynn and PG&E made a series of=20
missteps that ultimately would result in the third-largest bankruptcy in U.=
S.=20
history.=20
Yet the man at PG&E's helm remains largely unknown to the millions of=20
Northern California ratepayers who write his company a check each month. An=
d=20
that's just how Glynn prefers it.=20
His own public relations people say their boss does not like to be the=20
subject of "personality-oriented stories" and tends not to agree to=20
interviews for profiles.=20
In his meeting at The Chronicle, Glynn, 58, shed his suit jacket and spoke=
=20
confidently about his company's bankruptcy prospects and California's energ=
y=20
problems.=20
But he declined further interviews, saying he would be too busy preparing f=

criticisms from Gov. Gray Davis that her proposal placed too high a=20

Mike Florio, senior attorney for The Utility Reform Network, said that extr=

The Board of Supervisors passed both measures by unanimous vote.=20
The county -- which expects to see a $2 million increase in energy costs ne=

The latest estimate is that the state is spending $70 million a day to buy=

"The state budget surplus is being used up to pay the out-of-state=20

The memo "certainly has statements in it that could lead one to believe the=

=20
Press.=20
The chief lawyer for the PUC in the El Paso case, Harvey Morris, has urged=
=20
the federal commission to make public the full record in a series of=20
complaints he has filed since 1998 charging El Paso with managing pipeline=

contracts to inflate energy costs in California.=20
The evidence, Morris has said, includes documents he describes as "smoking=

The New York Times has reported that in the sealed memo, officials of an El=

contract it signed several weeks later.=20
"(Morris) wants to try the case in the media," Scherman said.=20
As for Wagner's comments, Scherman said, "I'm not losing sleep over it."=20
Scherman said Wagner acknowledged shortly after he made the statement that =

had not yet read El Paso's briefs in the case.=20
Scherman said he urged Wagner to keep the memo sealed until El Paso puts it=

that the memo could be released when Wagner issues his recommendations to t=

On March 1, 2000, El Paso Merchant Energy took over=20
1.2 billion cubic feet of space on the pipeline, which imports natural gas=

from Texas and New Mexico. The pipeline supplies about half of California's=

Bush follows stump script on energy=20

N53504.DTL&type=3Dnews=20
Washington -- In a speech nearly seven months ago, George W. Bush revealed=
=20
the outline of the energy plan he will roll out tomorrow.=20
Bush has followed that script so closely since then that there can be few=
=20
surprises in his plan, which favors increased production of fossil fuels,=
=20
opposes wholesale electricity price caps and offers little short-term relie=
f=20
from California's deepening energy crunch.=20
Despite the White House fanfare surrounding the proposal and the months of=
=20
closed-door meetings that went into its creation, Bush mapped out the plan=
=20
during an Oct. 13 campaign speech in Michigan.=20
The outline he presented back then meshes so closely with what is known of=
=20
the new plan that it begs the question: Why did the White House go to the=
=20
trouble of creating the task force that ultimately drafted it?=20
Bush "talked about ideas and principles and goals throughout the course of=
=20
the campaign," said White House spokesman Ken Lisaius. The task force, head=
ed=20
by Vice President Dick Cheney, he said, "is taking the theme and the broad=
=20
picture of the directions we want to go into, and putting that into the=20
context of how do we do that."=20
In his October speech, delivered to autoworkers in Pontiac, Mich., Bush sai=
d,=20
"America runs on the oil and gas and coal we gain from the Earth, and from=
=20
water held behind our dams. No matter how advanced our economy might be, no=
=20
matter how sophisticated our equipment becomes -- for the foreseeable futur=
e,=20
we will still depend on fossil fuels."=20
To a remarkable degree, the speech foreshadowed nearly everything the=20
administration has been saying ever since about its forthcoming energy=20
policy. Even its political approach -- courting Michigan autoworkers --=20
dovetails with the new administration's courtship of unions this week to ba=
ck=20
his energy plan.=20
Accompanying the speech was a detailed outline, still available on the=20
campaign Web site, of a "comprehensive national energy policy" with more th=
an=20
20 initiatives to improve U.S. "energy independence."=20
It covers nearly every subject that has been mentioned by the White House=
=20
Energy Policy Task Force for the past four months. It specifically recommen=
ds=20
not only Bush's controversial proposal to drill in part of the Arctic=20
National Wildlife Refuge, but also, as Bush suggested Friday, to support ne=
w=20
hybrid- fuel automobiles. And it talks of encouraging more energy purchases=
=20
from Mexico and Canada, an idea Bush and Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham=
=20
have been promoting ever since.=20
Indeed, Bush's consistency -- which has repeatedly surprised Washington's=
=20
political establishment -- is nowhere more apparent than on energy policy.=
=20
That consistency has generated criticism, even from moderate Republicans,=
=20
that the new administration has turned a deaf ear to environmental concerns=
=20
and conservation, sending the White House scrambling to offset its anti-=20
environment image.=20
CALIFORNIA CRISIS
It has also opened the administration to charges that it is ignoring=20
California's worsening electricity crisis. The task force energy plan is=20
expected to focus, as Bush promised, on the long term and to contain little=
=20
that will directly address the state's blackouts.=20
Rep. Chris Cox, a Newport Beach Republican who with other California=20
Republicans was extensively briefed by Cheney on the new plan, said critics=
=20
who charge that the report is skewed too heavily toward increasing supply a=
nd=20
too little toward conservation will be surprised.=20
"I think I have as much access to it as the people who are saying those=20
things," Cox said, "and I can guarantee you they haven't read it."=20
Cox said Cheney "has emphasized that conservation and alternative fuels are=
=20
essential elements of our 20-year strategy" and that Bush is likely to call=
=20
for "a tripling of reliance on on alternative fuels. So I think both the=20
criticism and the response will be improved by actually reviewing the=20
administration plan when it's released, and everything else is just=20
anticipatory."=20
OPPOSITION TO PRICE CONTROLS
Cox also cited the administration's continuing, and apparently firm,=20
opposition to the price controls on wholesale electricity that California=
=20
Democrats, from Gov. Gray Davis on down, are asking for.=20
"On the conservation side, there is no better means of sending a strong=20
conservation signal than through the price mechanism," Cox said. "I think=
=20
that precisely because conservation must be an essential element of the=20
overall solution, price controls are viewed with great skepticism."=20
The administration said Saturday that the plan would contain tax credits fo=
r=20
"hybrid" automobiles that run on gasoline and electricity. Last October, Bu=
sh=20
told the autoworkers, "I am confident that you -- some of the best engineer=

San Francisco -- The largest electricity rate increase in California histor=
y=20
was adopted yesterday by state regulators after a one-day delay in which th=
e=20
burden on residential consumers was raised by more than $100 million.=20
The Public Utilities Commission split along party lines, the three Democrat=
ic=20
appointees backing the increase and the two Republicans voting against.=20
"We cannot put our heads in the sand," said Democratic commissioner Jeff=20
Brown amid jeers from protesters in the PUC's San Francisco meeting hall. "=
We=20
cannot pretend that this is a problem we can walk away from."=20
The PUC had been scheduled to vote on the increase Monday but postponed a=
=20
decision because of concerns that businesses would pay a disproportionately=
=20
large share of the nearly $6 billion to be raised from higher bills.=20
The revised measure adopted yesterday shifted about $106 million from=20
businesses and placed it squarely on the shoulders of residential consumers=
.=20
In the case of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., residential customers will see=
=20
electricity rates soar by almost 55 percent, to 22.1 cents per kilowatt hou=
r=20
from 14.3 cents.=20
But electricity rates are different from bills. Because about half of all=
=20
residential ratepayers are exempt from higher charges, overall monthly bill=
s=20
will increase by lower amounts.=20
Consumers who can stay within 130 percent of predetermined usage limits wil=
l=20
experience no increase at all.=20
Other residential customers, including most families and multiperson=20
households, will see their average monthly electricity bills rise by betwee=
n=20
6 percent and 37 percent, depending on the amount of power used.=20
The effect of higher electricity rates is mitigated somewhat because other=
=20
charges on PG&E residential bills will not change.=20
"These are the largest rate increases that I know of," said Paul Clanon, he=
ad=20
of the PUC's energy division and chief architect of California's new rate=
=20
structure.=20
The higher rates will take effect as of customers' June 1 power bills but=
=20
will not be fully reflected in monthly charges until July 1.=20
Consumer advocates adopted a fatalistic attitude to the rate increase, whic=
h=20
regulators fast-tracked over recent weeks as state coffers have been rapidl=
y=20
depleted from daily power purchases.=20
The state Department of Water Resources has spent more than $6 billion sinc=

s.=20
"The state is going broke," said Mike Florio, senior attorney for The Utili=
ty=20
Reform Network in San Francisco. "We have to get the money from somewhere.=
=20
Bankrupting the state is not an alternative."=20
However, he said, it would have been preferable for consumers if the PUC ha=
d=20
adopted an alternative rate structure that would have cost residential=20
customers about $400 million less.=20
That alternative was never given serious consideration by the commissioners=
,=20
who focused instead on a rival proposal submitted by PUC President Loretta=
=20
Lynch.=20
Although the commissioners were acting on a rate increase of historic=20
proportions, the meeting hall took on a surreal air yesterday because three=
=20
of the five members chose to be elsewhere for the occasion. They spoke and=
=20
voted via speakerphone.=20
Lynch, who was at the Millbrae City Hall, called the rate increase=20
"unfortunate" but said higher bills will address the state's financial=20
troubles and promote conservation.=20
She wrote in her proposal that "every consumer in California is justified i=
n=20
feeling outrage at the rates we approve today and the bills they will have =
to=20
pay tomorrow."=20
But Republican Commissioner Richard Bilas, speaking from the Mendocino Art=
=20
Center, said the PUC was moving too quickly in enacting rate increases that=
=20
had not been fully analyzed.=20
Warning that the rate increase will lead to "a recessionary death spiral," =
he=20
said, "Many businesses will flee the state or shut down entirely."=20
Bilas' Republican colleague, Henry Duque, speaking from a Texas hotel, said=
=20
the rate plan was "incoherent" and "misguided" and will do nothing to promo=
te=20
construction of much-needed new power plants.=20
PROTESTERS' TAUNTS
The only two commissioners present for yesterday's vote were Brown and his=
=20
Democratic colleague Carl Wood. They were forced to bear the brunt of taunt=
s=20
from protesters in the audience.=20
One protester, Susan Rodriguez of Oakland, was escorted from the hall by=20
California Highway Patrol officers after loudly attempting to place Brown a=
nd=20
Wood under citizen's arrest.=20
"Do the right thing," other protesters shouted. But Brown countered that=20
"mature people must bite the bullet" and accept the necessity of higher=20
rates.=20
Industrial power users, including many Silicon Valley stalwarts, had lobbie=
d=20
aggressively for lower rates, arguing that they were being asked to bear an=
=20

Gov. Gray Davis finally found a captain to steer his leaking ship -- the=20
complicated and politically risky plan to save Southern California Edison -=
-=20
through uncharted legislative waters.=20
Until this week, nobody in the Legislature wanted to touch Davis' secretly=
=20
negotiated agreement with Edison, which needs lawmakers' approval. It's not=
=20
that nobody cared -- almost every player in the Capitol now has an idea on=
=20
how to infuse the utility with cash, bargain down anxious creditors and avo=
id=20
the drawn-out hassles of debtors court.=20
Democratic Sen. Richard Polanco of Los Angeles, who is termed out next year=
,=20
agreed this week to carry the governor's bill, which has met with almost no=
=20
support. At least three other major proposals are circulating in the Assemb=
ly=20
and Senate, along with a desire by some lawmakers to simply let Edison go=
=20
bankrupt like Pacific Gas & Electric.=20
"There is a great sense of urgency here," said Brian Bennett, a spokesman f=
or=20
Edison, which supports the governor's original idea to buy the transmission=
=20
lines and infuse the company with cash. "We can't escape the fact that we c=
an=20
be dragged into involuntary bankruptcy at any time."=20
The outcome could determine if the energy crisis ends in months or years. I=
f=20
the Legislature and Davis can help bring financial stability to Edison, the=
n=20
the price of energy will likely fall, easing financial pressure on PG&E and=
=20
its creditors. The bankruptcy judge in the PG&E case may also scrutinize th=
e=20
Edison deal for clues.=20
"It's something that's not only important for keeping Edison out of=20
bankruptcy, but it's also an important framework and model for PG&E to get =
it=20
back on its feet," said Assemblyman Keith Richman, R-Northridge, who is=20
helping the GOP negotiate the Edison agreement.=20
Edison is constantly negotiating with its creditors over the huge debts it=
=20
owes to power generators that charged inflated prices last year. The state=
=20
finally took over the job of buying power in January, and has spent more th=
an=20
$6 billion so far -- money it expects to get back from a bond sale financed=
=20
by ratepayers.=20
It seems clear Davis' draft agreement with Edison is doomed as written in t=
he=20
Legislature. The governor's plan would require the state to sell more bonds=
=20
and give Edison $2.76 billion. In exchange, the state gets Edison's power=
=20
lines. The company would get a guaranteed profit of 11 percent for a decade=
=20
in order to pay off its debt, reportedly at $3.5 billion.=20
Most lawmakers hate the idea of purchasing the Edison power lines, in part=
=20
because then California would have to maintain and repair them. PG&E actual=
ly=20
has the biggest bottleneck in the power grid, so purchasing the Edison line=
s=20
would do nothing to solve that problem, Richman noted.=20
"The grid is an asset that essentially has no value to the people of=20
California or to the ratepayers," Richman said, "and does nothing to bring=
=20
more electrons to the state."=20
Other revisions are circulating:=20
-- Senate leader John Burton, D-San Francisco, and others don't like Davis'=
=20
plan to give out-of-state power generators full credit for all the money th=
ey=20
are owed by Edison. The generators, which face investigations for price=20
gouging, may be forced to reduce their bills by 30 percent if they want to=
=20
get paid.=20
-- A"Plan B" group formed by Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg, D-Sherman Oaks=
,=20
and which includes Assembly Republicans is looking at, among other things,=
=20
building more energy plants instead of purchasing the transmission lines.=
=20
They believe they could build enough plants to power between 2 million and =
3=20
million homes, using money dedicated from Edison ratepayers.=20
-- A plan by Assembly members Joe Nation, D-San Rafael, and John Dutra, D-=
=20
Fremont, would simply give the state an option of buying the transmission=
=20
lines, for $1.2 billion instead of $2.76 billion. Edison's parent company=
=20
would be required to contribute $400 million to the utility.=20
The Nation-Dutra plan would dedicate a larger share of each bill to paying=
=20
off debt, allowing Edison to more quickly begin buying power. "We're trying=
=20
to find a way for the utilities to get credit worthy sooner rather than=20
later," Nation said. "That will allow the state to exit the power buying=20
business."=20
-- Some Republicans are pushing for businesses to be able to contract=20
directly for their power without going through the current state-run grid.=
=20
Businesses like the idea because they pay less for power, but Democrats say=
=20
it puts the burden on residents who don't have the clout to write their own=
=20
contracts.=20
Davis may be willing to consider this as part of a deal that would get the=
=20
Edison agreement through the Legislature. He and his staff have been=20
negotiating nonstop with lawmakers in an attempt to win any support.=20
Edison is keeping close tabs on the developments in the Capitol, meeting wi=
th=20
lawmakers to discuss the deal and the ramifications if it does not win=20
approval.=20

The new rate plan, which goes into effect June 1, was the result of=20
last-minute jockeying by commissioners and staffers in Gov. Gray Davis'=20
office to try to bring down rates for industrial and agricultural users.=20
In the end, no one came away happy. The commission lowered agricultural rat=
es=20

higher. Industrial and large commercial users got almost no last-minute=20

The commission vote fell along party lines, with Democrats Loretta Lynch,=

Jeff Brown and Carl Wood voting for the new rate structure, and Republicans=
=20
Henry Duque and Richard Bilas voting against it.=20
Wood said he regretted having to raise rates at all. But the increased cost=

of wholesale electricity left the commission with no alternative, he said.=
=20
``There is no justice in any decision we can come up with because the=20
underpinnings -- the paying of these wholesale prices -- are unjust,'' Wood=

said.=20
The vote came amid jeers from protesters, who wore black to mourn the death=
=20
of the California economy.=20
As Wood did, Brown blamed the higher prices on energy wholesalers, who he=

said are gouging Californians.=20
``I hear you when you say there will be pain and suffering,'' Brown said.=
=20
``But unfortunately, the wholesale prices have put us in an untenable=20
situation. We cannot put our head in the sand.''=20
Duque and Bilas were harshly critical of the rate plan, saying it placed to=
o=20

Duque said he was troubled by the ``moral'' implications of the new rate=20

BY DANA HULL=20

Mercury News=20


The electrical rate hike plan approved Tuesday by the PUC is designed to=20
reward conservation and punish heavy users. The new rate plan, which goes=
=20
into effect June 1, creates five levels, or tiers, of billing. Households=
=20
that stay within 130 percent of their ``baseline'' level of use will face n=
o=20
increase at all.=20
What is the baseline?=20
The baseline is considered a minimum level of use based on regional and=20
seasonal averages. It was set up to make sure that residential consumers we=
re=20
provided the minimum amount of electricity necessary at the lowest possible=
=20
price. Customers are charged one price for baseline use and a higher price=
=20
for electricity that is over the baseline amount.=20
Is the baseline the same for everyone?=20
No. PG&E's residential customers are assigned different baselines because t=
he=20
climate and elevation of Northern California vary so widely. The Bay Area i=

roughly divided into three climatic territories: the coastal areas includin=
g=20
San Francisco and the Peninsula; the East Bay and the South Bay; and the=20
Santa Cruz Mountains. You can best determine your baseline by checking your=

So do people who live in hot places like Fresno or Bakersfield get a higher=

Bakersfield has the highest baseline at 498.=20
Is the baseline the same all year?=20
No. There is a winter baseline and a summer baseline. The summer baseline=
=20
went into effect May?1, and the winter baseline goes into effect Nov.?1. .=
=20
How can I find my baseline on my bill?=20
The electric portion of your bill shows the baseline amount in kilowatt-hou=

Yes. PG&E says that 48,000 customers are on Medical Baseline Service. These=

SAN FRANCISCO -- State power regulators finally decided Tuesday how to spre=

But Pacific Gas and Electric Co. customers who consume the most will see=20
their rates jump from 14.3 cents per kilowatt hour to 25.8 cents per kilowa=
tt=20

electricity.=20
The plan, approved 3-2 by the state Public Utilities Commission, affects=20
about 9 million customers of PG&E and Southern California Edison Co.=20
Even after the vote, there was confusion within the PUC over the new rates.=
=20
The commission released three sets of figures throughout the day, each with=
=20
dramatically different rate hikes. Spokesmen for both PG&E and Edison said =
it=20
will take at least a day of number crunching to know precisely how the rate=
=20
hikes will affect the dozens of different customer classes.=20
The new rates, which will appear on June bills, were approved nearly seven=

Commissioner Richard Bilas said too high a percent of the hikes had been=20

customers, it appears to have been done at the expense of small and medium=

businesses, which make up the majority of businesses in this state,'' Bilas=
=20
said as he urged his fellow commissioners to vote against the proposal.=20
The 80 percent figure for the biggest electricity users came from a chart=

Under state law, a portion of every residential customer's electric use --=
=20
called baseline, a percentage of the average amount of electricity use in a=
n=20
area based on climate, geography and season -- is shielded from rate hikes.=
=20
The PUC could only raise rates on power use beyond 130 percent of baseline.=
=20
Clanon's chart shows an average 60 percent rate hike on all electricity use=
=20
that exceeds 130 percent of baseline.=20
The biggest losers are the biggest users.=20
Residential power use is divided into five tiers, and electricity used with=

PG&E's top tier will jump by 80 percent. About 9 percent of PG&E's househol=
ds=20

Those hikes for the top tier translate into an average increase of $85 --=
=20
from $232 to $317 -- on monthly bills for such customers.=20
For Edison's heaviest residential users, the rate hike in the top tier is 7=
1=20
percent -- or an average increase from $194 to $265 on monthly bills.=20
Even top-tier customers will not pay more for electricity use that falls=20
within that first 130 percent of baseline.=20
However, commercial, industrial and agricultural customers will have to pay=

their rate hikes on every kilowatt.=20
Steve Strong, a plum and nectarine grower in Visalia, was optimistic the ra=

This is the first in a three-part series examining the Northeast's debate=
=20
over three key issues: generation, transmission and environment. How the=20
region deals with these issues could become a model for the rest of the=20
country.

All politics are local. That's what the late Speaker of the U.S. House of=
=20
Representatives Thomas P. "Tip" O'Neill liked to say. Given recent energy=

industry events in his native Northeast, O'Neill would probably see little=
=20
reason to say otherwise.


So when the Bush administration's national energy policy is released, it wi=

On these three issues local politics in the Northeast are driving decisions=

Political strains may soon show through if power shortages hit parts of the=

=20
EXPECTED LOAD AND CAPACITY FORECASTS=20
SPREADSHEEThttp://public.resdata.com/ei_departments/lead/load_forecast.xls
However, the details show a less certain picture. NPCC forecasts 4,900 MW o=
f=20
excess capacity, but says 4,000 MW of that is locked up in Quebec and the=
=20
Canadian Maritime provinces where transmission bottlenecks will block most =
of=20
that extra power from reaching U.S. markets. The U.S. portion of NPCC could=
=20
end up with no more than 1,000 MW of reserve capacity at a time when peak=
=20
demand is expected to reach 54,000 MW.=20

Existing transmission lines across parts of New York state are all but maxe=
d=20
out and can't be relied on to deliver much additional power to New York Cit=
y.=20
Transmission constraints mean that some 80% of New York City's power needs=

(and 98% of Long Island's) must be met through local generation. In testimo=

before a legislative panel in March, New York Public Utility Commission Cha=

Maureen O. Helmer said that if summer temperatures reach levels hit in July=
=20
1999, demand in New York City alone could top 11,000 MW and outstrip=20
available supplies by more than 850 MW.=20

Unlike California, where little generating capacity was added during the=20
1990s, new power plants are being built in the Northeast. But new plants ar=
e=20
only part of the equation. Transmission line owners say they lack financial=
=20
incentives to upgrade connections to help ensure that newly built, low-cost=
=20
plants are dispatched. Transmission congestion in New England has risen=20
sharply since 1999 and is expected to double in and around Boston by 2005.=
=20
"If there's a bottleneck, then the cheapest power plant may not be=20
dispatched," said Ian Davis, vice president of transmission for National Gr=
id=20
USA, which controls roughly 30% of New England's transmission network.=20

These issues and others will resonate across the U.S. and Canada as=20
politicians, utility executives, special interest groups and consumers look=
=20
for a balance among rising electric demand, environmental and lifestyle=20
protection and the need to make a buck.=20

Binary world
Here's the irony: In its simplest form, today's digital economy relies on=
=20
binary computer code to either turn a system "on" or "off." As demand for=
=20
power grows, the options for electric power appear increasingly binary, too=
.=20

"You can build a transmission line and a power plant, or sweat in the dark,=
"=20
said Doug Logan, principal with RDI Consulting. "Take your pick."=20

Energy's current calculus values local opinion greatly when it comes to pow=
er=20
plant and transmission line siting, and on issues related to the environmen=
t.=20
That makes it tough for regional and national points of view to be heard.=
=20
This, in turn, affects efforts to set up regional energy markets and=20

Local groups vowing "not in my back yard" have scuttled power plant and=20
transmission line plans, including Cisco Systems' successful effort to bloc=
k=20
a power plant proposed for its Silicon Valley corporate park. On the=20
environmental front, states appear willing to adopt strict measures, even i=
f=20
they risk part of their generating capacity. Recent rules in Massachusetts=
=20
targeted six in-state power plants, whose output accounts for fully 40% of=
=20
the state's electric generation.=20

"Siting always comes down to very local issues," said National Grid's Davis=
.=20
"These projects move from bad news to worse news to slightly better news."=
=20

In late March, the Connecticut Siting Board voted 7-1 to reject TransEnergi=
e=20
U.S. Ltd.'s proposal to build a $125 million, 330-MW transmission cable=20
beneath the waters of Long Island Sound to Long Island, N.Y. Though the Lon=

Island Power Authority had identified the project as critical to improving=
=20
its access to off-island power supplies, the Connecticut Board said the lin=
e=20
would have little, if any, direct benefit to Connecticut and rejected it.=
=20

"It's hard to imagine a decision more parochial," said Ashley Brown,=20
executive director of the Harvard Electricity Policy Group. The siting boar=
d=20
"didn't look at the benefits to New York or the region."=20

In April, Massachusetts Gov. Jane Swift announced new power plant emission=

=20
emission control rules.=20

Also in April, a report by New York State Electric & Gas Corp. (NYSEG)=20
criticized a statewide assessment by the New York Independent System Operat=

(ISO) on issues including power plant siting. The plant permitting process=
=20
has not worked, NYSEG said. "Delayed in-service dates for new generation ar=

including lengthy project reviews and local lawsuits designed to block=20
projects.=20

No doubt, introducing competition, establishing new political orders and=20
restructuring markets are proving to be tough. And the process still has a=
=20
long way to go.=20

Frontier politics
But if power politics in the Northeast appears confused and unsettled,=20
consider that the region's history of cooperation on energy issues is uniqu=
e=20
in the U.S., a legacy of its tight power pool structure. On this score the=
=20
region may stand a better chance than elsewhere of working out compromises.=
=20
In Mississippi and Wisconsin, one source said, transmission lines march to=
=20
the state line and stop, their step across the frontier blocked by politica=
l=20
decisions on the other side.=20

One sticking point in the Northeast, and elsewhere, has been the slow pace =
at=20
which competitive markets appear to be evolving, particularly in terms of=
=20
adopting new approaches to help markets operate smoothly.=20

For example, transmission systems were designed to move power from one=20
utility's power plants to its load center, a straightforward and largely=20
local function. The rise of wholesale power markets strains this model by=
=20
adding expectations that the lines will also carry power from independent=
=20
power producers to more distant load centers.=20

This new use taxes existing lines and complicates the issue of who gets=20
transmission access when. It also raises local bugaboos over sacrificing=20
Farmer Jones' cornfield for a new transmission line, which may have little =
if=20
any tangible local benefit. Just this sort of local environmental issue san=
k=20
TransEnergie's Long Island Sound proposal in March when environmentalists=
=20
pointed to potential risks to local shellfish beds.=20

"A significant need exists to reinforce the grid to keep up with wholesale=
=20
sales as well as local load growth," said Joseph S. Graves, a member of=20
Washington, D.C.-based PA Consulting's management group. In a paper publish=
ed=20
earlier this year, the company concluded transmission is the industry's=20
weakest link, having changed the least relative to the rest of the industry=
.=20
The report also called for a series of investment incentives to encourage=
=20
more investment in transmission infrastructure.=20

"Until the health of the transmission sector is improved, the entire electr=
ic=20
power industry will underperform," the report said.=20

Underperformance could extend to generating assets, which should have ranke=
d=20
among the Northeast's shining accomplishments. After all, the region is one=
=20
of the few places building toward a capacity surplus, and surplus is viewed=
=20
by many as the key to achieving workable wholesale power markets.=20

Incremental change
But transmission constraints and a lack of incentives to expand the grid ma=
y=20
hurt power plant developers' efforts to provide new, low-cost,=20
environmentally friendly capacity.=20

"Our strategy is to find financial incentives to deliver additional value t=
o=20
customers and our shareholders," said National Grid's Davis. "Competitive=
=20
markets mean greater uncertainty. The incentives encourage us to look for=
=20
incremental changes that deliver value quickly, rather than build grand=20
schemes that rely on paybacks over 40 years."=20

Since wholesale markets opened in 1999, Davis has seen high levels of=20
transmission congestion in New England, which he says deter efforts to get=
=20
the most economical power to customers. Congestion affects Boston and=20
northeastern Massachusetts in particular. There, incumbent power generators=
=20
have a competitive advantage as a result, and perhaps an unwillingness to s=
ee=20
competitors enter the constrained market, Davis said. Even so, getting new=
=20
capacity sited can be a problem, whether in Massachusetts or elsewhere.=20

Choke point
In its report last month complaining about local permitting regulations bas=
ed=20
on a recent market assessment by the New York ISO, NYSEG said the ISO=20
"unrealistically" assumed 8,600 MW of new generation could be built in the=
=20
state by 2005. "Actual experience has shown it can take this long to work=
=20
through the ineffective and inefficient licensing process."=20

The siting problem may not be entirely local. A power developer active in t=
he=20
region said federal agencies present more of a choke point. In proposing th=
e=20
now hotly contested 1,080-MW Athens generating station near the Hudson Rive=
r=20
in New York state, PG&E National Energy Group needed approval from the=20
state's siting board, as well as from the Federal Energy Regulatory=20
Commission, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Army Corps of=20
Engineers, the Federal Aviation Administration, the U.S. Fish & Wildlife=20
Service and the Coast Guard.=20

"There's no one-stop shopping" and time limitations do not exist at the=20
federal level, said Dan Whyte, director of permitting for the Bethesda,=20
Md.-based developer. The developer applied for a permit from the Corps of=
=20
Engineers in February 1999 and, as of early May, was still waiting. "That=
=20
could not happen at the state level" where permits were issued a year ago,=
=20
Whyte said.=20

Indeed, New York state's system gives its siting board 12 months to reach a=
=20
yea or nay decision; 18 months if circumstances warrant more deliberation.=
=20
Plus, the New York system has strict rules of evidence and tight requiremen=
ts=20
to determine who can intervene, standards that don't exist at the federal=

level.=20

"We have 31 plants in 19 states and each of those states has a defined=20

That may change under the Bush administration's proposed energy policy. Par=
t=20
of the proposed policy may include legislation extending federal eminent=20

PG&E, State Regulators Spar in Court

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Contending California regulators are
illegally seeking billions of dollars that should be paid to its
creditors, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. urged a federal bankruptcy
judge to dismantle the accounting framework insulating the
utility's customers from additional electricity price increases.


Looking to guard its turf, the California Public Utilities
Commission portrayed its actions as legal maneuvers protected from
federal government interference under the U.S. Constitution.


The 2{-hour bout of arguments Monday before U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge Dennis Montali represented the first major legal showdown in
PG&amp;E's bankruptcy case _ the largest ever filed by a utility.


After peppering attorneys from both sides with tough questions,
Montali took the matter under submission without providing a
timetable for issuing a decision.


The complex issue centers on arcane sections of the U.S.
bankruptcy code that could sway the balance of power in PG&amp;E's case
and determine whether the utility's 4.6 million customers _ or more
than 150,000 creditors _ absorb the costs underlying an estimated
$13 billion in wholesale electricity purchases made from June 2000
through March 2002.


As part of the 1998 deregulation of California's electricity
market, PG&amp;E's retail rates were to remain frozen through March
2002 or whenever the utility pooled enough money from above-market
rates and asset sales to pay for unprofitable investments made
during its long history as a regulated utility.


PG&amp;E says it cleared the hurdle for lifting the rate freeze
sometime between May 2000 and August 2000 _ around the same time
the utility's costs for wholesale electricity began to soar far
above the frozen rate charged to its customers. Between January
1998 and May 2000, PG&amp;E accumulated a $2.75 billion operating
profit from a favorable gap between its wholesale costs and retail
rates for electricity.


The utility said it could have proved its case for lifting the
rate freeze and passing on its electricity costs if the PUC hadn't
adopted new accounting guidelines March 27 _ 10 days before PG&amp;E
filed for bankruptcy. Besides changing the accounting rules
governing the rate freeze, the PUC's March 27 order also authorized
average price increases of up to 40 percent for households and up
to 52 percent for businesses.


PG&amp;E says those increases _ expected to begin showing up in June
electricity bills _ still aren't enough to recoup its costs.

On the eve of the release of the 170-page report, the broad outlines are=20

and a push for conservation. But since the task force's work began in=20

nation's thorniest energy issues.=20
Individuals from the task force have met with more than 400 people from mor=

In a recent interview, Vice President Dick Cheney said: ''The staff of our=

But last month, two Democrats on Capitol Hill challenged the secrecy of the=

days. David S. Addington, counsel to the vice president, responded that it=

California Could Face Cash Crunch Soon --- Spending on Power Worries=20
Treasurer, and Moody's Cuts State Bond Ratings

California's mounting electricity expenditures are putting the state on a=
=20
slippery slope that could lead to a cash crunch later this year.=20
And even if the nation's most economically important state is able to arres=
t=20
the slide by raising billions of dollars in bonds as it currently=20
anticipates, residents will still face spiraling electricity rates and a=20
mountain of state debt that will affect them for years to come.
That is the grim assessment of credit analysts and even the state treasurer=
,=20
who is attempting to assess the long-term costs of a three-year-old=20
experiment in electricity deregulation that has gone badly awry. Sums up Ri=
ch=20
Raphael, a credit analyst at Fitch: "The situation is serious, and the stat=
e=20
is taking on more and more risk."=20
Yesterday, Moody's Investors Service Inc. lowered its ratings on $25.5=20
billion of state of California bonds, citing "substantial revenue=20
deterioration" caused by the state's slowing economy and "financial risks"=
=20
posed by state electricity woes. Last month, Standard & Poor's Ratings Grou=
p=20
took a similar step, shortly after the state's biggest investor-owned=20
utility, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. sought bankruptcy-court protection.=20
Moody's action lowered the rating on $19.8 billion worth of general=20
obligation bonds to Aa3 from Aa2 and $5.7 billion in lease revenue bonds to=
=20
A1 from Aa3.=20
Moody's says it believes that by August the state treasury will have spent=
=20
$10 billion for power, but it conceded that a blackout on pricing informati=
on=20
imposed by state officials means estimates are partly guesswork. Raymond=20
Murphy, an analyst in Moody's public-finance group, said "not very much"=20
information has been given to his unit detailing state expenditures for=20
electricity. This is unusual, both because the state is a public entity and=
=20
because credit-rating agencies usually are given full access to internal da=
ta=20
by clients.=20
The state has been the largest buyer of electricity in the nation since=20
January, when runaway wholesale power costs outstripped the purchasing=20
ability of the state's biggest investor-owned utilities, Edison=20
International's Southern California Edison unit and PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Ga=
s=20
& Electric unit. To date, the state has allocated $6.8 billion for=20
electricity purchases.=20
How much the state is paying daily for electricity isn't clear. Since April=
,=20
the state Department of Water Resources, which is purchasing power on behal=
f=20
of the utilities, has enforced a ban on the public release of cost=20
information.=20
It pressured the California Independent System Operator to suspend posting =
of=20
that information on the ISO's Web site. In a letter sent to the ISO, Water=
=20
Resources Deputy Director Ray Hart said "premature disclosure" of price dat=
a=20
"disadvantages" the state in its quest to buy electricity at the lowest cos=
t.=20
At the time, out-of-state generators were being paid an average of $520 per=
=20
megawatt hour for power supplied to the state grid operator.=20
In a Sunday television interview, Mr. Davis said the state last week paid a=
s=20
much as $1,900 per megawatt hour for power.=20
If California is paying that kind of price very often, it spells big troubl=
e=20
for the state's ability to replenish its coffers. Last week, the state=20
Legislature approved a plan to issue a record $13.4 billion in revenue bond=
s,=20
but they can't be issued before mid-August. If there is further delay, says=
=20
State Treasurer Philip Angelides, the state will have "significantly=20
depleted" the funds it can tap internally.=20
Indeed, Mr. Angelides says the state will have enough internal resources to=
=20
meet its power-purchase obligations through the fall only if average spot=
=20
prices are no higher than $195 per megawatt hour during the critical=20
July-through-September time period. If daily prices are substantially highe=
r=20
than that, "they will bust the plan," he says. The result, credit analysts=
=20
fear, would be a liquidity crisis. The state would have essentially run out=
=20
of money before receiving bond proceeds needed to repay the general fund.=
=20
Complicating matters is an expected sharp drop in tax receipts. The state=
=20
said it expects annual revenue to decline by $3.2 billion for fiscal 2002,=
=20
the first drop since 1992.=20
Some people disagree that the state is substantially at risk. S. David=20
Freeman, an energy adviser to Mr. Davis, says the state is following a=20
"sensible plan" to stretch out power costs into future years, when they are=
=20
expected to drop substantially. Mr. Freeman argues that higher rates will=
=20
prompt greater conservation, reducing the amount of money the state has to=
=20
spend. "All this stuff about the economy going under is a bunch of hogwash,=
"=20
Mr. Freeman says.
