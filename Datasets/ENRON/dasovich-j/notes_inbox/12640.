Dear Everyone,
?
I, Bob Hillman, will be playing three dates in California  in June.? Consider 
yourselves warned!? I will be accompanied by Billy  Masters, an electric 
guitar player from New York.
?
Please take special note of the third concert, a house  concert in Marin 
County.? For those of you who have never attended a house  concert, or even 
heard of the concept, it actually takes place in someone's  home.? In this 
case, it's the home of my friend and fellow songwriter  Christopher Smith, 
best known for his classic song, "Dead Horse  Trampoline."? I encourage you 
Northern California types to consider  attending this event, as it promises 
to be a good time and a new  experience.? Contact Christopher at 
deadhorse5@home.com for reservations and  directions.? 

Also, feel free to check out the recently expanded www.bobhillman.net for 
tour dates and  other information.? See you in June!
