One more e-mail!  I have calls into all the offices.  I need to call 
Crawford's office back late on Monday (talked to his Chief of Staff - Matt 
Back).  We left it that the others will call me back.

Confirmed are:  John Bryson - 3:30 on May 2 in L.A. (I have a call in to move 
that one later, if possible).
David Freeman - 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. on May 3 in Sacramento;  Robert 
Hertzberg - 1:00 p.m. on May 3 in Sacramento; Bob Glynn - 9:00 a.m. on May 4 
in San Francisco.

More later.
