I got this from Hanson.  Please advise as to which points we agree with and 
which we disagree with.  I want to know because I talk to this guy quite a 
bit and EES and ENA are trying to do a deal with him.  I probably will have 
several opportunities to influence him, if necessary.  Barbara Barkovich and 
Bill Booth probably had a big hand in developing this doc.



Any follow up necessary?
