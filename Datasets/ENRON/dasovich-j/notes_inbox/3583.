Hi Everyone,

Attached please find your Fall 2001 schedule.

From now until Friday, May 11 you will have an opportunity to add and drop
classes by e-mailing tj@haas.berkeley.edu (you may not make changes in
TELEBEARS).

In your e-mail, please indicate the classes you want to add and drop.
 Other students may want to add your dropped classes and we'd like to let
them know in May, rather than in August.  On Monday, May 21, we will again
confirm your Fall 2001 class schedule by e-mail and we will export the data
back to TELEBEARS.  Textbooks and readers will be ordered for you based on
this confirmed schedule.  NO CHANGES TO SCHEDULES FROM MAY 12 - AUGUST 26.

Classes with waitlists:  E210 Competitive Strategy; E252 Negotiations; E264
High Tech Marketing; E278 Deals; E291B-1 Speaking for Management; E295
Entrepreneurship; E296-2 Business Law.

Thanks,

TJ
