Attached for your information is a copy of the Petition for Modification of=
 =20
D.01-05-064 which ABAG POWER filed on July 13.? On behalf of ABAG, I would =
=20
like to solicit your support of this petition.? The decision in question is=
 =20
the Commission's May 15 decision where it approved the rate design for the =
=20
three-cent rate increase.?=20
?
You may recall that the decision approved a 12-month surcharge for all =20
bundled service customers to make up for the revenue which PG&E and SCE did=
 =20
not recover during the interim period between the March 27 issuance of =20
D.01-03-082 and the subsequent issuance of the May 15 decision.? You also =
=20
know that the May decision provided specifically that DA customers were NOT=
=20
to  be subject to the rate increase.=20
?
The ABAG petition for modification seeks to have the Commission clarify  th=
at=20
DA customers who received DA service during the interim period between the =
=20
two decisions should not be subject to the one-year sucharge, even if they=
=20
were  subsequently returned to bundled service.? The arguments supporting=
=20
this  position are as follows:

Direct  access customers were specifically exempted from the=20
procurement-related rate  increase because they do not receive procurement=
=20
service.? They should therefore be similarly  exempted from the12-month=20
procurement surcharge, even if they subsequently  returned to bundled=20
service.? =20
The inability of PG&E to pay all amounts  due and owing under the PX credit=
=20
have caused the budgets of ABAG POWER  Members to be placed under significa=
nt=20
financial stress.? The Member public agencies have  suffered extreme=20
financial hardship.?  The application of the 12-month procurement surcharge=
=20
has added to that  burden unnecessarily.
In a separate  proceeding (draft Resolution E-3726),? the Commission has=20
expressed  its intent to =01&guard against inequities=018 for direct access=
=20
customers of  SDG&E.? ABAG POWER asks simply  that the Commission afford=20
similar protection to the direct access customers  of PG&E who did not=20
receive bundled procurement service during the  interval between the March=
=20
and May Decisions.?=20
Moreover, in addition  to being inequitable, the application of the=20
procurement surcharge to  non-procurement direct access customers would be=
=20
discriminatory and would  cause the utilities to violate the=20
anti-discrimination provisions of the  Public Utilities Code, Sections 453(=
a)=20
and 453(c).

ABAG POWER  would very much appreciate the support of ESPs and other market=
=20
participants at  the Commission.? Under Rule 47(f) of the Commission's Rule=
s=20
of Practice and  Procedure, "Responses to petitions for modification must b=
e=20
filed and served  within 30 days of the date that the petition was served,=
=20
unless the  administrative law judge sets a different date. Responses must =
be=20
served on the  petitioner and on all? parties who were served with the=20
petition and must  comply with the requirements of Rules 2, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3,=
=20
and 2.5."? Filings  sooner than that would be appreciated.? Please give me =
a=20
call or email if  you are willing to file in support of the ABAG petition.?=
=20
Thanks very  much?for your consideration of our request.
?
