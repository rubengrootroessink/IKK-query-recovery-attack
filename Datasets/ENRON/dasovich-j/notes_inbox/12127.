Here is my draft on the DA language.? I  have left cross references to parts 
I believe will be defined in other sections  of the overall bill.? Call me or 
email me at the office and at home if you  need more.? I will talk with you 
Monday AM at the latest.? Sunday I  will be at a Giants game but will check 
my cell phone voice mail from time to  time if it is an emergency.??
