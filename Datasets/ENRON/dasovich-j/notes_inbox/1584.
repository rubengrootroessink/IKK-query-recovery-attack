Hi Jeff,

First of all thank you for taking the time to see us this Friday. You asked
me to email you with some information on what we would be talking about.
There will be three of us coming, myself, Pradeep and Neil. What we would
like to discuss is the new, emerging Internet data centers and our solution.
We would like to explore market validation of our product and describe why
we will be a vital component of Internet Data Centers (IDCs).  We look
forward to meeting with you.

Best regards,

John Protzel
