If you could fax it that would be great.  #612-339-4392  I'm assuming that we 
would be comfortable with the outline they are proposing?

Jim--could you let me know what contacts you are making/what the discussion 
is?  Maybe we could discuss on todays leadership call?

Yes, we have been working with them.  Stephanie and I were asked to meet last 
week with the heads of the California Chamber and the California 
Manufacturer's Association, at which we discussed demand buy down, etc. at 
length.  It was a very positive meeting.  

Stephanie left them with Reliant's Westwide demand exchange program.  And I 
believe that our folks (Jim?) are meeting with Reliant to discuss it further 
in D.C.  

I can fax you a copy of what they're walking around if you don't have it.  
I'll let others chime in, but seems to me that it would be very useful to 
contact him.

Best,
Jeff

Hey guys.  Are we in communication or working with Reliant in California?  In 
particular, a guy by the name of  John Stout or a woman (I think she's PR) 
named Stephanie Newell?  My understanding is that they are shopping a demand 
exchange idea---in particular in Utah.  I would like to contact him in 
preparation for the RGA meeting in Los Angeles, but wanted to check with you 
all first to see what we might already be doing with them.
