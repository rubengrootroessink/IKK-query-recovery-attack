Jeff-
yes I do want you to participate on the natural gas panel. I have it planned
for Tuesday November 14th from 1:30 to 3:00. If you do prepare materials
please make enough copies for the whole group (about 80) or email them to me
and I will make the copies. I am trying to avoid having to make copies at
the conference as they charge about 25 cents per page.

Please let me know if you want me to participate in any gas panels.  And my
feelings won't be hurt if you say no.  Worry not.  Just need to know so
that I can prepare some materials.

Best,
Jeff
