CCMI is hosting a Special Edition of its exclusive Telecom Negotiation 
Workshop to cover the FCC's Detariffing Order.

The FCC Detariffing Order eliminates the baseline tariffs that underpin all 
negotiated deals.  Whether you're starting fresh or re-opening an existing 
deal, the ground-rules have changed replaced by an entirely new regulatory 
regime that changes your access to baseline price information, your insight 
to market rates and fundamentally alters your relationship with carriers.

If you've been one of the 1000's who've attended Telecom Negotiation Workshop 
in the past, you need to come again, and if you've not previously taken 
advantage of this exclusive program that can help you get the best telecom 
deal, then don't miss this special program in March.

Join the telecom industry's #1 legal team on contract negotiations Hank 
Levine, Ellen Block and Steve Shea, along with George David, CCMI's Director, 
for 2 hard-hitting information-packed days and they will...

*   Take you through an exclusive 16-POINT PRE-NEGOTIATION CHECKLIST that 
gives you a running start at the bargaining table
*   Reveal how the FCC'S NEW PUBLIC DISCLOSURE RULES give you access to 
market prices and key T&Cs.
*   Show you how "MAC CREEP" can put you in a dangerous - and costly - 
shortfall position unless you have the right "MAC CUSHION"
*   Explain how to BLEND DETARIFFED SERVICES with tariffed international and 
intrastate services.
*   Give you a "TRAFFIC ROADMAP" that shows you how to size your switched, 
private line and frame relay traffic and avoid making commitments you can't 
keep
*   Tell you how to position your company to get the benefit of the FCC'S 
CALLS ACCESS CHARGE PLAN.
*   Reveal how "WRAP-AROUND CLAUSES" can extend your interstate discounts to 
cover your intrastate minutes, too

Reserve your spot now to join your colleagues at The Tradeswinds Resort in 
Tampa, FL on March 12-13.
