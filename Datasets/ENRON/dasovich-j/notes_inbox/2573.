Dear Students,

There will be no more formal evening reference desk hours at Long Library
beginning 7pm tomorrow, Thursday, December 14, until Spring classes start
up in January. If anyone needs assistance please email or call me with
questions or to make an appointment.

Happy Holidays to all of you. Looking forward to seeing and hearing from
you again in January. I will be scheduling several library research
workshops next Spring. If there is a particular topic or database that you
would like to see covered please send me a note.

Until . . .

Monica Singh
