This is what I think the deal is.  The boys have to take two cars cause
there will be six of us on the way back.  I think Scott and Molly (the
creative, non-9-5 types) are going to drive together and try to leave before
traffic on Friday (i.e., before 2 p.m.).  My guess is that then Colleen and
Jeff (the creative-but-not-giving-up-their-day-job types) are going to drive
together and leave after traffic. (i.e., after 7 p.m.).  This scenario,
however, is all my own deductive reasoning and could easily be WRONG.  I
expect we will know more after tonight...

We usually stop in Napa on the way back from the festival for an early
dinner and relaxing before heading back to the city.  So, don't forget to
bring your bathing suits with you so you can swim and stuff.

See you all up there.  Wish me luck flying with Prentice at the
controls!!!!!

croquet, ping pong and bocce (just kidding)

Something with polenta.  How about the pork chop we made before.  Do you

Not sure which pictures I want - I just thought some of them were pretty
good.  I'll have to figure it out.
I think you are going to see us sometime.  We usually stop by Napa on our
way back from the festival this weekend.  Will you be around - can we do our
Sunday dinner in Napa??

I am going to order some more Domaine on June 25.   If you want any more,
please put a check in the mail to me for $64.50 a case so that I receive it
by June 25.  I am only going to order whole cases this time.  Depending on
the number of cases, delivery will probably be on June 28.   Thanks.
