My preference is to analyze a recent clean merger?in order to further 
understand M&A valuations. I?am not too excited by obscure accounting 
rules. One recent merger that would be personally good to analyze is 
the Intel acquisition of Xircom - about to close any day now... Here is a 
URL with further details about the acquisition. 

http://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/20010115corp.htm

What's interesting is that Intel effectively paid about 1x sales for this 
company. They announced a purchase price of ~750 million, but the
firm has about ~300 mil cash on the books, making it effectively ~450
million. The firm's annual sales are ~500million. 

Any interest? I'm open to analyzing any merger...

Greetings:

Sounds like I'm glad that I missed the quiz last week.

Hate to be a nag, but we've got to turn in what we're doing for our project
on Thursday. I propose doing a nice, clean merger, which would allow us to
do both comparative analysis (who are these companies?) and
merger/valuation analysis. Mark and I talked last night and I pleaded
again not to do strict accounting stuff, but if that's what folks would
like to do, I can certainly suck it up. Any thoughts?

Best,
Jeff
