Good day all:
I want to update you on some events regarding Perix.  I have tried to
contact them today via telephone, web site and email and I'm not having
any
luck.  I presently don't know if they are in business or been bought out
by
another firm or what.
The Web Site I tried:  perixindustries.com connects me to another firm
SRS
Consulting.
Email address:  perixgroup@aol.com gives the following error "This is
not a
known member"
Telephone number 714-923-2612 and fax number 714-923-2601 are
continuously
busy.
If you have the correct contact numbers, please let me know.

Some history:
Oct 4, 2000, Chairman of the Board for Perix Industries, Mr. James E.
Reinmuth stated in an email, "I will personally commit to the
preparation of
a Perix newsletter within the next 60 days which summarizes the results
of
negotiations with several potential joint venture partners, and our
plans for
Year 2001."
I have received no information.  Mr. Reinmuth's letter was in direct
response to the concern raised by several shareholders on the lack of
information on our investment.  If anyone has received the newsletter,
please
email me and I'll forward a check to you to mail me a copy.

Nov 8, 2000:  Letter sent to Perix Industries by attorney Zachary A.
Wright
of Short, Cressman & Burgess, PLLC on behalf of myself requesting
financial
information of Perix.
As per Mr. Wright, I quote the following, which was sent to Perix in
the
letter:
QUOTE
California corporations are required by law to make certain
information
available to shareholders.  First, an annual report must be provided to
shareholders within 120 days of the end of the corporation's fiscal
year,
unless this requiremetn is waived by the corporation's bylaws.
Cal.CorpCode
1501(a).  Even if the requirement is waived, the corporation must
provide a
year-end financial report to a shareholder within (30) days of the
shareholder's request for it.  Cal.CorpCode 1501(c).  This year-end
financial
report must contain a balance sheet and an income statement, as well as
a
statement of changes in financial position for the fiscal year.  It must
be
accompanied by a report of the corporation's independent accountants or,
of
there is no such report, a certificate signed by an authorized officer
of the
corporation that the statements were prepared accurately and completely
from
the books and records of the corporation.  Second, California law
requires
that corporations make available to shareholders "accounting books and
records" of the corporation, as well as the minutes of any proceedings
of
shareholders, the board of directors or committees of the board of the
corporation.  Cal.CorpCode 1601.   This definition encompasses all books
of
account, accounting journals, share registers or duplicate share
registers.
We hereby demand that you copy and mail to us the information that
must be
made available to Mr. Remijan under California law no later than thirty
(30)
days from the date of this letter.
UNQUOTE
My attorney or I have not received any word or information from
Perix
regarding this request for financial information.  Mr Wright advises
that I
could file a lawsuit for a writ of mandamus or other order to obtain
this
information from Perix.  California law Cal.Corp.Code 1603 and other
applicable law also provides for payment of all costs and attorneys'
fees by
the corporation in the event that the shareholder is required to file
suit to
obtain the information.

If anyone has further information about whether Perix is still in
business, I would appreciate an email.  Something tells me that it
doesn't
look good for us.  I hope that I am wrong.
Thanks and best regards,
Mark Remijan
