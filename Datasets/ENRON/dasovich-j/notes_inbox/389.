Subject: New Hampshire Continues Restructuring





The New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (NHPUC) on Friday, September 
8th issued orders approving 
a restructuring Settlement Agreement which will provide PSNH customers with 
significantly lower rates and the ability to choose an energy supplier. 




Consumers Utility Cooperative (NHCUC), announced today that it has money 
saving electric power for sale for all 
commercial, industrial, residential ratepayers, both large and small in New 
Hampshire Electric Cooperative (NHEC) territory below the 
5.628 cents per kwh standard offer price.
