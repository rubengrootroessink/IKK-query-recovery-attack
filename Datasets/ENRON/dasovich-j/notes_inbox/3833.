Since the case asked us to evaluate this from Munro's point of view, it is
his
job to examine the potential the deals in the best interest of Time's
shareholders.  Therefore, in my opinion we will have to incorporate the
after-tax value to the Time shareholder as one piece of the puzzle.  The
difficulty with the tax implications to the shareholder is that we do not
know
the average shareholder's cost basis.  It should just be a mention in our
memo.


As I mention in a previous e-mail, there is no tax implication to the
corporation except for the leverage and tax shield.  Unless we completely
recreate the DCF I don't think we can accurately quantify the tax shield
advantage especially since we don't know how the additional leverage will
alter
the WACC, i.e. what is the optimal WACC of the combined company.  Another
complication is the difficulty in recreating the DCF is the timing and tax
implications of the asset sales which we know to be around $3.5 billion.

Our professor doesn't seem to require any advanced calculations.  We are
probably all right with some approximations.

Jeff:

I have been looking at your numbers and I have a few questions.

1).     If we look at this from the stand point of the Time shareholder's,
we do not really need to worry about the make-up of Time-Paramount after
the merger.  Since this is an all cash deal, the purchase price will be
given to Time's shareholders.  This amount needs to be above the DCF of the
Time-Warner deal for us to suggest it.

2).     As for the taxes maybe Mark can shed some light on the
issue.  During the acquisition phase the only taxes that will be paid will
be the capital gains paid by Time Shareholders.  Paramount will not pay
taxes on the purchase.  Paramount's tax position will improve due to the
increased debt payments.  Looking at it from Time shareholder's we really
don't care do we?  Maybe I am wrong.

Otherwise everything looked good.  I like the common sized balance
sheet.  I should be home all day tomorrow.  Call me at 925-362-0210 and let
me know how I can pitch in.

Dylan
