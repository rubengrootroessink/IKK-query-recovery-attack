Perry fills one spot on PUC 
Former Enron exec draws opposition 
By JANET ELLIOTT 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle Austin Bureau 
AUSTIN -- Mario Max Yzaguirre, a former Enron executive, was appointed 
Wednesday by Gov. Rick Perry to the state agency that is overseeing 
electricity deregulation in Texas. 
Yzaguirre was named to replace Judy Walsh on the three-member Public Utility 
Commission of Texas. 
Yzaguirre, of South Padre Island, recently resigned as president of Enron's 
Mexico operations. He formerly worked as a lawyer at Houston's Vinson & 
Elkins. 
In 1989, Yzaguirre was fined $15,000 after pleading guilty to a federal 
charge of killing a whooping crane while hunting near the Aransas National 
Wildlife Refuge north of Corpus Christi. Yzaguirre, who thought he was 
shooting at a snow goose, also paid $6,480 in restitution to the state over 
the death of the endangered bird. 
He is the son of former University of Texas Regent Mario Yzaguirre of 
Brownsville. 
The governor's office also is working to replace Chairman Pat Wood III, who 
stepped down after President Bush named him to the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission, which oversees interstate electricity transmission. Yzaguirre 
will join Commissioner Brett Perlman, a former business consultant. 
Janee Briesemeister, a consumer advocate who monitors the PUC, said the 
appointment of a energy industry insider "sends the wrong signal to consumers 
in the state, particularly when that energy company is Enron, which has 
profited handsomely from the energy crisis in California." 
"While resignation of his position at Enron and divestiture of any 
energy-related stock holdings may meet the technical requirements of the law, 
the intent of the law is to eliminate even the perception of a conflict or 
impropriety," said Briesemeister, senior policy analyst for Consumers Union. 
"Regardless of his actions while commissioner, a perceived conflict could 
limit his effectiveness." 
The PUC is monitoring the deregulation of the Texas electric market, set to 
begin Jan. 1. Deregulation in California has resulted in skyrocketing energy 
costs and electricity shortages. The PUC also oversees the telecommunications 
market. 
Yzaguirre had been with Enron from 1995 until his recent resignation. Enron 
is Houston's largest company in terms of revenues, generating $100.8 billion 
in 2000. 
Enron is vying to become a player in the deregulated Texas market. It formed 
the New Power Co., a nationwide power and natural gas retail marketing 
concern catering to residential and small-business customers. 
The company is a joint venture of Enron, IBM and AOL Time Warner.
