TO: AD HOC GROUP

We received good coverage in the LA Times Friday, as well as CNN Financial
(Street Sweep Program).  We received mention in the Chronicle and NY Times
Saturday.  No doubt there is more to come, and much I have missed.  Anita
Patterson, in my office, is keeping a media file.  Your additions are
appreciated.

We have a chance to make a difference.  There seems to be some momentum
building for a rate hike.  Would appreciate your reactions to Gov. Davis'
latest proposal.

Thanks,
David
