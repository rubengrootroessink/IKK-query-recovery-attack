Subject: E19/20 prices for core/non-core discussion

I've done some numbers that will help in a discussion around timing of any 
split.
This graph shows $/MWh prices over time.  It compares 

a) solid lines (EES cost)  -- forecast using yesterday's commodity prices 
plus T&D&CTC (without any surcharges)

b) muted lines -- forecast using our bundled prices where surcharge is set at
 1 cent plus 3 cents rest 2001; 1 cent plus 2.4 cents for 2 years; goes to 
cost-of-service beyond
 where 2/3 of undercollections for IOU's are collected



Here are some PV prices that are derived from these curves
- for different starting dates and 1/3/5 year terms.
