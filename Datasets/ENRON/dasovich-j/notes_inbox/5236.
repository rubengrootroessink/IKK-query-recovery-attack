Hello,

By now everyone should have received a copy of the Evening MBA News in your
student mailboxes.

Well, thanks to modern technology, it is now available on the web as well.
So if you forgot your copy and you wanted to show your co-workers or felt
the urge to read it at work, just pull up
http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/EvMBA/ and click on "Evening MBA News."  You
can even print it out and give yourself an extra copy!
