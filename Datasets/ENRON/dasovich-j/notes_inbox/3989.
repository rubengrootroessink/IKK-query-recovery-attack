Thanks for your appreciation!  I will still peruse the articles and indeed 
forward any which look pertinent!

FYI - I don't know what you use for resources, but I find this site 
invaluable -- 
Here's the URL:

Additionally,  I use this one quite a bit as well for the "local take" on 
things:

Hope this helps a little!

Joseph

Joseph, 
you're absolutely right -- there's no need to duplicate work.  I've been 
asked by our PR group to target those specific Calif. news sources every 
morning.  

Thanks for all of your help.  If you happen to come across any pressclips 
that may be interesting, please forward them.
