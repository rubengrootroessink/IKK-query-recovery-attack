Thank you for your order. It will be picked, packed, and shipped to you as 
soon as possible, usually within 24 hours. If there will be a significant 
delay due to out-of-stock merchandise, we will ship what we have in stock 
immediately and send along the back-ordered item(s) as soon as they come in, 
at no additional shipping charge to you.

If you are not already in our database, we will add you to our mailing list 
for catalogs, sale flyers, and other special notifications. We will not 
inundate you, and we will never sell or rent our list to other companies.

Thanks again for your order.
