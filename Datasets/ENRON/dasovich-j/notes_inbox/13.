I've attached a draft of WPTF's reply to the resopnses of FERC and the 
ISO/Oversight Board to WPTF's motion for judicial notice of various documents 
surrounding the price cap incident this summer in the governance appeal, 
along with a response to FERC's and the ISO/Oversight Board's motion to 
strike portions of our initial brief related to those documents.

I look forward to discussing this with you on Monday.

Ron
