"I take great offense at (President) Bush's comment that it's our right as=

David Aragon, a Berkeley engineer who says he coined the phrase "Roll Your=

=20
politics but is nonpartisan.=20
He said he just learned this week that Los Angeles artist Monica Rex was th=

sent it out into the world.=20
Rex said she e-mailed a few paragraphs to about 50 friends in mid-April and=

posted them on a handful of Web sites to make people aware that they have t=

power over how energy is used.=20
She thought so little of it at the time that she didn't keep a copy.=20
"I didn't know it would get anywhere, actually," she said. But it took off.=

By mid-May, multiple copies were landing in e-mail boxes of nearly everyone=

Softley, who knows a little about stirring up community action, was so stru=

E-mail- and Web-driven protests have triggered fuel boycotts in Great Brita=

Many versions say the voluntary blackout -- "a simple protest and a symboli=

Some variants direct people to books on alternative energy and energy=20

Michael Straus of Point Reyes said he plans to take part by having a=20

Several news organizations and Republican Assemblyman Tony Strickland,=20

The contracts, worth almost $43 billion, could keep long-term rates=20

Under Davis' plan, the ISO, manager of the state's power grid, will also=20
issue a 48-hour rolling blackout forecast and the 24-hour location=20

Peter Navarro, an economist with University of California, Irvine who works=

"It's going to be like the typical California forecast =01) sunny, hot and =

The Governor's Office of Emergency Services coordinated the plan to impleme=

A utility official, who participated in the calls and who spoke on the=20

"doesn't come anywhere close to what's been promised to the public.=20
"Instead of a real one-hour notice of an outage that people can rely on and=

Blackout forecasts, Conroy said, are "very much like a weather forecast" an=

Eric Lamoureux, an emergency services spokesman, said the plan isn't intend=

Utility customers don't need a guarantee, just a warning that blackouts cou=

"The objective here is to allow customers to prepare for the eventuality of=

we do need is more than 30 minutes notice."=20
Jennifer Ng, the owner of Moonlight Cleaners in Elk Grove, said she'd welco=

"It affects businesses more than people think," Ng said. "If I had more=20

To really give a true blackout warning, Shames said, the ISO must "draw the=

"That's why they shouldn't be issued cavalierly."=20

The state's secret energy deals won't be secret much longer.=20

the state's agreements with power suppliers by noon tomorrow to attorneys=

power purchases over the next decade.=20
Revelations that California has contracted to pay as much as $154 per=20

that the state had overpaid for electricity. The price of the commodity is=

The Los Angeles Times? and at least one other newspaper, which obtained som=

By comparison, spot prices yesterday for power were from $55 to $65 per=20

Until last June, prices rarely exceeded $50 per megawatt-hour. Deregulation=

Gov. Gray Davis' strategy in dealing with budget-busting costs over the pas=

Yesterday, he said comparing contracted electricity costs to spot prices is=

unfair.=20
"The price of spot market electricity is coming down because we have locked=

getting long-term contracts is to wean ourselves away from a spot market."=

The governor referred to the often-cited criticism that California's soarin=

power prices were caused partly by an excessive dependence on buying power =

daily markets, as opposed to under longer contracts.=20
Severin Borenstein, an expert in electrical deregulation from the Universit=
y=20

with contract prices was unfair.=20
Speaking at a news conference yesterday hosted by the governor's press=20

conditions that existed as they were negotiated.=20
Spot prices during the first three months of this year, for example, averag=

"We have to get out of this deregulation disaster."=20
Parts censored
For months, Davis refused to make public details about the contracts, sayin=
g=20
that revealing information about the deals would put the state at a=20
disadvantage in contract negotiations.=20
The state became a major electricity buyer after the near-bankrupt utility=
=20
companies were unable to make purchases on their own.=20
This week, however, Davis agreed to release the contracts, with certain=20
portions censored. The governor's change of heart came as the newspaper=20
reports emerged and critics alleged that the state was overpaying.=20
A spokesman for Enron Corp. said yesterday that the state had many=20

Senate Democrats to Use Power to Illuminate Bush Energy Plan=20

?????With their sudden ascension into the Senate majority, Democrats have=

subpoena documents. And that could signal a major shift in the debate on a=
=20
broad range of issues--energy policy foremost among them.
?????Though the Democrats lack a coordinated strategy, several committees=

ethical misdeeds by the Clinton administration.
?????"The public doesn't want to see a party that's out for blood. If they =

?????Senate Republicans wasted no time denouncing the hearings as a waste o=

time. "Let me tell you what the name of the game is now: It's pure politics=

said Sen. Frank H. Murkowski (R-Alaska), who chaired the Energy and Natural=

Resources panel until the Democratic takeover.
?????Asked about Wednesday's proceedings, he replied: "Is that going to=20

?????Conscious of both the opportunities and risks, Democrats are moving=20
cautiously to exercise their new clout. Lieberman has not issued any=20
subpoenas in his investigation into California's power crisis, and his firs=

?????Still, the authority to investigate has always been one of Congress'=
=20
most potent tools, particularly when Capitol Hill and the White House are=

?????Over the last century, congressional hearings have largely divided int=

?????Hearings also have been used to look for misbehavior in the private=20
sector, usually as an attempt to lay the groundwork for reform legislation,=
=20
such as the Depression-era hearings on the stock market crash that led to t=

creation of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
?????And, finally, legislators have used the hearing forum as a competitor =

the president's bully pulpit--as a means to draw attention to ideas the Whi=

=20
1960s, when nationally televised hearings by Sen. William Fulbright (D-Ark.=
)=20
on Vietnam crystallized opposition to the war.
?????During Clinton's presidency, Republicans emphasized ethics=20

his case for price controls--then summon officials from the Federal Energy=

Regulatory Commission to explain why they have rebuffed that request.
?????Sources say Lieberman is considering a third hearing that would summon=

electricity producers, whom Davis has accused of "gouging" California.
?????As Lieberman proceeds, Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.), the Energy=20
Committee's new chairman, is scheduling hearings next week on electricity=

on the issue, a request aides expect will be followed up with a subpoena=20
during the summer. The aides say Levin is not likely to require oil company=

executives to publicly testify until late fall.
?????Sen. Larry E. Craig (R-Idaho) predicted Democrats will have a difficul=

Pollution: Relaxed rules for "peaker" plants could push Ventura County over=

By GARY POLAKOVIC, Times Environmental Writer=20

?????Gov. Gray Davis' decision this week to relax emission controls at powe=

against smog.
?????The changes are bound to cause mischief for some California areas on t=

little extra pollution could be enough to thwart attainment of the national=

health-based ozone standards in the Bay Area, San Diego and Ventura County,=
=20
officials say.
?????Moreover, in case the governor's strategy doesn't work, he has left op=

the option of tapping the dirtiest power source available--legions of backu=
p=20
diesel generators. Those 12,000 engines would provide a few hundred more=20
megawatts, but at a terrible price for air quality, because they lack=20
controls and can spew about 10 times more pollutants than the very dirty=20
"peakers" that Davis exempted from emissions controls Monday.
?????"We're trying to make the best of a bad thing, but in the short term, =
we=20
are getting rolled. Air quality is going to suffer more this year, and ther=

will be some impacts," said Dick Baldwin, executive officer for the Ventura=
=20
County Air Pollution Control District.
?????Across most of Southern California, however, the energy crisis is not=
=20
likely to lead to dirtier air this year, air quality officials say.
?????The reason is that California's power plants, some of the cleanest in=
=20
the nation, contribute just 5% of the smog-forming emissions during summer=
=20
and half as much the rest of the year. The lion's share of the Southland's=

air pollution comes from cars and trucks. Two-thirds of the 16 power plants=

=20
summer, according to the South Coast Air Quality Management District, which=

regulates air pollution in Los Angeles, Orange and parts of Riverside and S=

Bernardino counties.
?????Those improvements should reduce overall power plant emissions about a=

r,=20
according to the state Air Resources Board.=20
?????For the most part, California air quality officials say the challenges=

but they acknowledge that they are under intense pressure from politicians,=

energy companies and manufacturers to relax regulations. California has mor=

=20
program to tame it, although progress toward a healthy environment is still=

?????On the other hand, officials are attempting to balance the need for a=
=20
clean environment with the need to keep the economy humming. The power=20
crisis, too, can be hazardous to people when blackouts knock out traffic=20
signals or cause heavy equipment to malfunction in the workplace.=20
?????An executive order that Davis issued Monday lifts emissions limits on=
=20
heavily polluting power plants, allowing municipalities and energy companie=
s=20
to produce as much power, and smog, as necessary.
?????The decision was reached after utilities such as the Los Angeles=20
Department of Water and Power noted that operating restrictions on so-calle=

Peakers are typically run by gas-fired turbines, similar to jet engines. Th=

strictly controlled in the first place.
?????Under the governor's plan, power producers will pay $15,000 per ton of=
=20
extra smog produced by the turbines. The money will go into a fund to pay f=
or=20
cleaning up dirty trucks, buses, boats and farm equipment to offset the=20
pollution from the power plants. Government estimates show that the plan=20
could provide up to 1,200 megawatts of additional electricity, but an=20
additional 500 tons of pollutants this summer.
?????Meanwhile, emissions from cars, trucks, buses and consumer products=20
continue to decline. Air quality is dramatically better today in the=20
Southland than it was a decade ago. Credit rigorous controls on everything=
=20
from lighter fluid to paint, oil refineries to autos, bakeries to landfills=
.
?????The trend of improving air quality should accelerate as power companie=

programs. The funds will be used to switch vehicles, farm equipment and boa=

to clean fuels, many of which can be converted this year to help offset pow=

plant emissions, said Catherine Witherspoon, policy advisor for the state a=

board.
?????"On the whole, there's not going to be a lot more smog. We expect=20
declining emissions from power plants," Witherspoon said.
?????Across Southern California, power plant emissions are up this year whi=

smog levels remain largely unchanged. Boilers and turbines have released mo=

anywhere in the region so far this year. The peak ozone reading has been 0.=
18=20
parts per million, a level comparable to last year's, said Joe Cassmassi,=
=20
senior meteorologist for the AQMD.
?????Smog levels are strongly influenced by weather, and in the approaching=

Gulf of California will bring unsettled air, which tends to reduce smog. He=

said that by year's end the region can expect a gradual return to El Ni=0Fo=

conditions, which portends an early end to smog season.
?????"The way the weather is lining up, it will be a typical year in a=20
long-term trend and the trend is toward improving air quality," he said.
?????The increased emissions from power plants, however, might be just enou=

of a multibillion-dollar cleanup effort spanning decades. Those communities=

federal sanctions and restrictions on highway funds.
?????"If we can make it through November without having two more violations=

County Air Pollution Control District. "That means the air quality is not=

?????The margin is even closer in Ventura County, which was once one of the=

yesterday in releasing a draft decision to grant the exemption.=20

"This is a very good step," said Scott Folwarkow, spokesman for the Valero=

ol=20
in gasoline as it phases out another additive that has polluted groundwater=
.=20
State officials have argued that ethanol, which reduces smog-producing=20
chemicals, is not needed to meet the state's air pollution requirements.=20
Gov. Gray Davis reacted angrily to the EPA's decision, saying it would rais=
e=20
gas prices significantly and expose the state to shortages.=20
"Their refusal will probably cost Californians 50 cents a gallon at the=20
pump," Davis said yesterday while visiting a community health center in San=
=20
Francisco. "It will do nothing to clean up the air, and it is the triumph o=
f=20
politics over good science.=20
"The consumers of California once again get the shaft. The Bush=20
administration once again sides with special interests. I'm not going to ta=
ke=20
it."=20
The EPA's denial is the latest sign of friction between the White House and=
=20
Davis, who have been battling over electricity prices.=20
The California Energy Commission estimates that consumers will pay $450=20
million more a year for gasoline if refineries have to convert to ethanol.=
=20
That translates to an increase of 3 to 6 cents for each gallon of gas.=20
If ethanol supplies are inadequate or if refineries encounter problems,=20
consumers could see gas shortages and price spikes as high as 50 cent a=20
gallon, according to the commission.=20
But EPA Administrator Christie Whitman said that the state had failed to sh=
ow=20
that a waiver of a federal Clean Air Act provision would not reduce air=20
quality. The law requires regions of the country with the worst air to use=
=20
oxygen additives in gas to reduce smog.=20
California requested the waiver because it is phasing out the additive MTBE=
,=20
or methyl tertiary butyl ether, which has polluted groundwater throughout t=
he=20
state. Ethanol is the only other additive approved under the federal Clean=
=20
Air Act.=20
DIFFICULTIES ADMITTED
Whitman acknowledged that California faced a dilemma in keeping MTBE out of=
=20
its drinking water while satisfying the federal law. However, she said,=20
oxygen- adding substances such as MTBE and ethanol in gasoline do reduce=20
smog-forming chemicals and should be used in urban areas with the worst air=
=20
quality.=20
MTBE DILEMMA
"The administration is concerned about the risks of MTBE in drinking water =
in=20
California and other states," Whitman said. "Clean air and clean water are=
=20
equally important. We do not want to pursue one at the expense of the other=
."=20
Since the widespread use of MTBE in 1997, it has become a major problem in=
=20
California and other states, tainting groundwater and threatening the=20
drinking water supplies of some areas.=20
Winston Hickox, secretary of the California EPA, said yesterday that the=20
planned ban might be delayed if the state Energy Commission decided there=
=20
were unsurmountable problems with converting to ethanol. But he didn't=20
believe California would back off on its efforts to rid gas of MTBE.=20
Sen. Dianne Feinstein yesterday accused President Bush of turning "a blind=
=20
eye to California," and Sen. Barbara Boxer said the decision was another=20
example of Bush's insensitivity to Californians. Feinstein has introduced a=
=20
bill that would give governors the authority to waive the additive=20
requirement if their gas met other standards.=20
OIL INDUSTRY DISMAYED
Oil industry officials in California, who have argued that refiners could=
=20
make an additive-free gas that qualified with federal and state requirement=
s=20
to reduce smog, also said they were disappointed with the decision.=20
"Over the last four years, we've made more than 2 billion gallons of=20
cleaner-burning gas that had no added oxygen -- no MTBE, no ethanol," said=
=20
Fred Gorell, spokesman for Chevron Corp. "The gas meets all the requirement=
s.=20
But we can't sell it in Southern California and Sacramento because of the=
=20
federal requirement."=20
BOON TO FARMERS
If MTBE is banned in 2003, and there's an oxygen additive requirement, ther=
e=20
would be no other choice than to use ethanol, Gorell said.=20
Ethanol is made primarily from corn, and the EPA decision is a boon to=20
Midwestern corn growers and lawmakers from states such as Illinois, Iowa,=
=20
Minnesota and South Dakota, who had lobbied the Bush administration heavily=
=20
to deny the waiver. The decision would create a substantial market for=20
ethanol.=20
According to the Renewable Fuels Association, an ethanol industry group,=20
California would need about 580 million gallons a year to use as an additiv=
e=20
in gas. In 2001, the industry expects to produce 2.1 billion gallons, and i=
s=20
gearing up to make 300 million gallons more with the addition of 34 plants.=
=20
BIG INITIAL COSTS
Adding ethanol to California's gas supply would require a major investment =
in=20
infrastructure, Gorell said. Some of the costs would go to modify refinerie=
s=20
as well as terminals where the ethanol blending would be done.=20
Costs of transporting ethanol from Midwestern states would not be the bigge=
st=20
problem, Gorell said. Ethanol can be brought by ships and barges, just as=
=20
most of the MTBE is brought now. Ethanol also can be brought by railcars,=
=20
which are prohibited from carrying MTBE.=20
But refiners can work with ethanol, he said. Even if the waiver were grante=
d,=20
there would a new market for ethanol in Los Angeles to combat carbon monoxi=
de=20
in the winter anyway.=20
Environmental groups welcomed the EPA's decision yesterday. Bluewater Netwo=
rk=20
of San Francisco said a coalition of 93 groups supported maintaining the=20
additive requirement to protect the air and the use of renewable ethanol in=
=20
gas.=20
The requirement could also be a boon to the state's agricultural industry.=
=20
The state has only two plants that make about 10 million gallons of ethanol=
 a=20
year from cheese whey and the sugar and starch from outdated soda pop. Six=
=20
new California plants are planned for next year.=20

Sacramento -- Gov. Gray Davis reversed course yesterday on the secrecy of=
=20
long-term energy contracts, saying he now wants to make public details of t=
he=20
deals the state has signed with electricity generators.=20
Davis and his advisers said they have signed enough contracts that releasin=
g=20
the information will not seriously jeopardize the state's bargaining=20
position. Administration officials, however, said the contracts contain=20
confidentiality clauses and they will ask a judge today to release the stat=
e=20
from those provisions.=20
Republican lawmakers and several media organizations, including The=20
Chronicle, have filed suit against Davis, demanding that the contracts be=
=20
made public.=20
"We now believe that the balance tips in favor of disclosure rather than=20
continuing to withhold the contracts," said Davis senior adviser Nancy=20
McFadden.=20
In San Francisco yesterday, Davis said he always intended to release the=20
information six months after the contracts were signed.=20
"Obviously, the market conditions are a little more favorable now," he said=
.=20
"On balance, we think it's the appropriate time to release the information.=
"=20
Davis' request will be heard at a court hearing today in San Diego on the=
=20
suits filed by the media and GOP lawmakers against Davis.=20
But it is unclear whether the judge will go along with the administration's=
=20
request or how the Davis administration will be able to proceed if it is=20
denied.=20
Paula Hall-Collins, a spokeswoman for Williams Co., said the energy company=
=20
will monitor the court hearing.=20
"We maintain that the contracts contain proprietary information," she said.=
=20
Patrick Dorinson, a spokesman for Mirant, also expressed concern about what=
=20
information might be released.=20
"We think it is important for the people of California to have information =
on=20
revenue and capacity information, but we are sensitive to specific terms=20
being released that could be misused by our competitors in the marketplace,=
"=20
he said.=20
The state has been purchasing power since Jan. 17. While much of that has=
=20
been on the expensive spot market, state officials have also locked in 38=
=20
contracts for long-term deals.=20
However, no information on the terms of the contracts or how much the state=
=20
is committed to spend has been released.=20
Ray Hart, Department of Water Resources deputy director, sent letters to=20
power generators yesterday saying the department will ask a judge to throw=
=20
out the confidentiality provision in the contracts.=20
The letter states that there will be some redactions on information that is=
=20
considered proprietary.=20
McFadden said the move was not made because the state was concerned about=
=20
losing its lawsuits.=20
She said she expected the court to release the state from the confidentiali=
ty=20
agreement. The governor's office then would release the documents as early =
as=20
this week, she said.=20
Lawmakers also have been demanding the release of the information so that=
=20
they can proceed on a plan to keep Southern California Edison out of=20
bankruptcy.=20
If the judge refuses to release the state from the confidentiality clause,=
=20
the administration will negotiate with the generators individually to allow=
=20
the contracts to be made public, McFadden said.=20
But Terry Francke, general counsel with the California First Amendment=20
Coalition, said he would be surprised if a judge allowed the request.=20
"I don't believe the court would simply absolve a party from a contractual=
=20
agreement at a proceeding where the other party is not present," he said.=
=20
Francke also questioned whether the state had the right to sign contracts=
=20
containing a confidentiality clause.=20
"There is a very serious question as to whether the state of California can=
=20
legally in effect promise to ignore the Public Records Act," he said.=20
Roger Myers, an attorney for The Chronicle, said there is good case law in=

the state supporting the releasing of the information.=20
"You can't enter into an agreement and convert public information into=20
confidential information," he said.=20

Price caps elicit fierce debate in Congress

Wielding the new power gained since the Senate shifted from Republican=20

Such high-price limits are also known as ``circuit breakers'' and have been=

But Feinstein and California Gov. Gray Davis would not support the $1,000=
