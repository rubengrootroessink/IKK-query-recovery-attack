Hi Everyone,

I thought it would be helpful to you, in filling out the faculty
evaluations that are quickly coming up, if I explained a bit further how
the administration views the
quantitative rankings you give to instructors. Specifically, there are two
questions at the end of the evaluation form that ask you about the teaching
effectiveness of the instructor and whether you would recommend the
instructor to a friend. You are asked to answer these two questions on a
scale from 1 - 7, with 1 being "Not at all effective" and 7 being
"Extremely effective."

As viewed by the administration, a median score of 5 or above is considered
acceptable. While we would love to have everyone earning a 6, this is
quite difficult to accomplish! Scores below 5 are taken very seriously.
In the case of a visitor earning below a 5.0, he or she is given one more
semester to improve  their teaching. If in the next semester the instructor
does not improve
(earn a 5.0 or above), it is unlikely he or she will be rehired.

In the case of a regular faculty member earning below a 5.0, the
administration works with him or her on a plan to improve his or her
teaching. In some cases, the
instructor may not be allowed to teach the course again.

Please be sure to utilize the full range of the evaluation scale so that we
can continue to reward those faculty members who are doing a great job and
work with those who need improvement.

Cheers,
Diane
