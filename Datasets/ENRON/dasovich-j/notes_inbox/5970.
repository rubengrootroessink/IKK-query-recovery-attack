AB955, which extends the system benefit monies beyond 2002 to promote 
renewable energy, directs the California Energy Commission ("CEC") to submit 
a draft report to the legislature on the allocation of monies between the 
various renewable energy programs.  The draft report recommends that the 
customer credit program be allocated 25% ($33.75 million per year through 
2006 and $168.57 total) of the funds on an annual basis for 2002-2006.  
(Under the current bill, AB 1980, the customer credit program started at 8% 
and will end this year w/ 20% of the allocated funds.)  Our verbal and 
written comments asked the CEC to recommend allocation at least 25% of the 
funds to the customer credit program, and to keep the allocation the same 
over the years to provide clear market signals.   While this is still in 
draft form, it is unlikely that the CEC will change their recommended 
allocation. 

Also outlined in the draft are the following:
1. The method for reimbursement will remain the same.
2. The credit cannot exceed 1.5 cents p/kWh.
3. Currently only in-state generation is eligible for the customer credit.  
The Committee is considering allowing out-of-state generation for 
eligibility, provided it is connected to the WSCC grid.
4. Nonresidential and non small commercial customers will be limited to the 
1,000 annual cap.  The fund for large commercial and industrial customers is 
restricted to 20% of the funds over the 5 year period covered.

The CEC is asking for comments on the draft (deadline next Tuesday).  I am 
concerned about the impact the restriction of 20% for large commercial and 
industrial customers will have on EES' book.   If this restriction will 
negatively impact EES' business, we should submit comments on this point.  
Richard, let's discuss some time today or tomorrow.

		 Subject: Customer Credit Extended

Wanted to let you know that AB995 which extends the customer credit 
subaccount (collection of nonbypassable system benefit charge to go through 
1/1/12) was passed by both the CA Assembly and Senate, and was signed into 
law by the Governor on 9/30.  Attached below is a link to the bill (click on 
enrolled version).   

The exact amount and allotment per year of the customer credit are to be 
determined.
