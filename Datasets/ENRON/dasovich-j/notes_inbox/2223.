Harris, Wiltshire Names New Partners

Harris, Wiltshire&Grannis LLP, a Washington communications and information 
technology law firm, has promoted Karen Gulick, Kent Bressie and Jonathan 
Mirsky to partner, effective Jan. 1. The firm, which emphasizes emerging 
technology and international issues, has grown rapidly partly due to its 
hiring of FCC attorneys.
A prime example is Gulick, who joined the firm as "of counsel" on her 
departure from the FCC last year. She advises clients on domestic and 
international regulatory and legal matters, focusing on wireless 
telecommunications. 
Gulick concluded her FCC career as legal advisor to Commissioner Gloria 
Tristani and took a key role in spectrum issues and emerging technology, as 
well as international telecommunications matters. 
Bressie specializes in proceedings before U.S. and foreign regulators and in 
international proceedings and negotiations. He also advises companies on 
legal and policy problems associated with emerging technologies and 
international business.
Mirsky advises telecommunications service providers, investors, lenders and 
investment banks on communications and regulation. He has worked on 
acquisitions and sales of FCC-regulated communications companies and on their 
debt and lending arrangements, as well as on spectrum leasing. 
The law firm's managing partner is Scott Blake Harris, once chief of the FCC 
International Bureau.
