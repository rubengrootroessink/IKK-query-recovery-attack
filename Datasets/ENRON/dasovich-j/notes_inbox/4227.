Jeff:

I am writing talking points on the California solution for Ken. Jim suggested 
that I look at language from Enron comments to FERC.  I realize that there 
are a number of comments, so I am contacting you to ask your advice on which 
comments are most relevant.  Do you have a copy of these comments?  As I need 
to finish these by Thursday noon, I appreciate your help as soon as possible.

Thanks!

Jennifer

By the way, I am going to be in Mountain View next month for a weekend and 
may try to stop by the office.  I will touch base with you closer to the 
date.
