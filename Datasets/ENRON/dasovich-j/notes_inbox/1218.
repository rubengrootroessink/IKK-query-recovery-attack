Subject:? HOW TO SURVIVE A HEART ATTACK WHEN ALONE - REALLY!

Let's say it's 6:15 p.m. and you're driving home (alone of course), after an 
unusually hard day on the job. You're really tired,? upset and frustrated. 
Suddenly you start experiencing severe pain in your chest that starts to
radiate out into your arm and up into your jaw.

You are only about five miles from the hospital nearest your? home; 
unfortunately you don't know if you'll be able to make it that far.?? What 
can you do? You've been trained in CPR but the guy that taught the course
neglected to tell you how to perform it on yourself.

HOW TO SURVIVE A HEART ATTACK WHEN ALONE
(Since many people are alone when they suffer a heart attack, this article 
seemed in order.)
Without help, the person whose heart stops beating properly and who begins to 
feel faint, has
only about 10 seconds left before losing consciousness.? However, these 
victims can help themselves by coughing repeatedly and very vigorously.?? A 
deep breath should be taken before each cough, and the cough
must be deep and prolonged, as when producing sputum from deep inside the 
chest. A breath and? a cough must be repeated about every two seconds without 
let up until help arrives, or until the heart is to be beating
normally again.

Deep breaths get oxygen into the lungs and coughing movements squeeze the 
heart and keep the blood circulating. The squeezing pressure on the heart 
also helps it regain normal rhythm. In this way, heart victims can get to a 
hospital.

Tell as many other people as possible about this, it could save their lives!
