o Bertelsmann Forms Alliance with Napster to End Lawsuit

NEW YORK -- Napster, which operates a Web site for
sharing music files in MP3 format, said it formed
an alliance with Bertelsmann that will result in
Bertelsmann dropping its copyright lawsuit against
Napster. The agreement stipulates that once Napster
has implemented a new membership-based service,
Bertelsmann's music unit will drop its lawsuit and
make its BMG music catalogue available on Napster.
The Bertelsmann eCommerce group will loan funds
to Napster to develop the new service and will have
a warrant to acquire equity in the company. A&M
Records and other recording companies, the Recording
Industry Association of America (RIAA), and the
National Music Publishers Association have also
filed a lawsuit against Napster that remains unresolved.
Hilary B. Rosen, the president of the RIAA, released
a statement saying the agreement was a positive
step but made no predictions of what the record
companies it represents would do in light of the
development. Napster is backed by Hummer Winblad
Venture Partners and individual investors.
