Folks-
Sorry for the delay --- major computer problems over here. I have used Ann's
document and added the changes I made as a template. It is in redline and
the questions are highlighted as well. Please look over it carefully and if
there is language you are going to provide please do it post haste.

WE WILL NOT HAVE A 2:00 CALL --- I think most folks are just too damn busy.
So, if there is a question, problem, disagreement, etc on language please
work it out amongst yourselves and send me new language if applicable.
Remember this is due to Rick BY 5:00 PM TODAY!!!!!

Call me with questions,
Delaney
