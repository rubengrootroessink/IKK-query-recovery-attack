	NEW YORK (VENTUREWIRE) -- Yesterday's story about AirMedia's new CEO 
misstated his background. Mark Bregman was most recently general manager of 
IBM's pervasive computing group, not the RS/6000 division. The story gave 
incorrect information about the company's backers. The company has raised $70 
million to date, not $90 million, and is backed by Citigroup Investments, 
Verus International, Prospect Street Ventures, Apex Teletech Resources, and 
Virgin Management Group. Bell Canada, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, 
Mitsubishi, and Mitsui are not investors in the company.

	NEW YORK (VENTUREWIRE) -- An item in yesterday's VentureWire about InfoMedics 
contained an incorrect description of the company. InfoMedics provides what 
it calls "experiential" patient data to the pharmaceutical industry, not 
"experimental." The company documents patients' experience with 
pharmaceutical products and provides that data back to physicians and 
pharmaceutical companies to support decision making.

	NEW YORK (VENTUREWIRE) -- Due to incorrect information provided by the 
company, an item in yesterday's VentureWire about Money.net's Series C round 
contained incorrect information about a new board member. The story should

observation seat.
