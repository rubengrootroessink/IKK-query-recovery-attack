The commercial teams at EES need to understand our opinion / perspective on=
=20
if Direct Access customers in the future will pay any surcharges.   Also, w=
ho=20
can we contact in CPUC and legislature or governor office to verify?

To make this make sense, I think that we need to think about this on a=20
"revenue item" basis (eg, Utility Undercollection from x date to y date).

Why not discuss on CA call tomorrow?
