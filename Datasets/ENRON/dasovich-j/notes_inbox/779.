I have noticed we have not been beating the SoCalGas price.  As I 
investigated this further, it appears the SoCalGas Reservation Charge was 
changed as of 6/1/00.  Did you notice this?  I don't think I saw the changes 
reflected on the most recent Savings Analysis spreadsheet.  I have attached 
the 8/2000 Commercial Industrial Rate Schedules Summary.

Can you please give some feedback?  I want to know how this should be 
figured.  The last rate was based upon November's usage, divided by # of 
days.  

Thanks,

Denise
