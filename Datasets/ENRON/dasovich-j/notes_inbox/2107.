Here is your chance to land a broadside on the issue of the gas PD.  Why
don't you call O'Donnell.

Mike, I cannot find a phone number for you, but wanted to see if
you had a comment on the Bilas PD in the gas industry
restructuring case.
Is there some element of the comprehensive settlement worth
fighting for? Do you see any of the issues gravitating to the Sempra
OII?

Any response appreciated. Thursday is deadline day. 415-824-3222

Thanks,
Arthur O'Donnell
