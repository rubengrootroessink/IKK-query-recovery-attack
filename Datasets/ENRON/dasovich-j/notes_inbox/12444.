By Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writer
(Published June 20, 2001)=20
California electricity prices have shot back up recently, potentially posin=
g=20
an early test of a new federal price-control plan that takes effect today.=
=20
Warm weather has sent wholesale prices doubling this week, partially=20
reversing a dramatic slide that had some state officials believing they'd=
=20
tamed the wildly unpredictable California electricity market.=20
The rebound in prices "would be expected," said Arthur O'Donnell, editor of=
=20
the California Energy Markets newsletter. "It's 110 degrees in Phoenix, and=
=20
it's 100 degrees (in Sacramento) and points in between."=20
Prices this week moved back above $100 a megawatt hour, about double what=
=20
they were last week -- although well below the roughly $300 suppliers were=
=20
charging California in mid-May. Prices showed signs of stabilizing Tuesday,=
=20
analysts said.=20
Experts said the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's new price-mitigatio=
n=20
plan is likely to curb the most severe price spikes. "This will eliminate t=
he=20
astronomical prices," said Severin Borenstein, director of the University o=
f=20
California Energy Institute.=20
But the plan probably won't bring California a cascade of cheap power,=20
either.=20
Prices likely will bump up constantly against FERC's new price caps, which=
=20
will fluctuate from time to time, and they're not likely to go much below t=
he=20
caps unless there's a significant glut of energy, said Peter Stiffler of th=
e=20
energy consulting firm Economic Insight Inc.=20
"Traders will always trade in at the price ceiling," Stiffler said. "They'r=
e=20
going to offer power at the highest price they can."=20
The fluctuating FERC caps are tied to the production costs of the=20
least-efficient, most-expensive generating plant operating in California wh=
en=20
supplies are tight and an official "power alert" is declared by the state's=
=20
Independent System Operator, which runs most of the power grid. When there=
=20
isn't a power alert, prices can't exceed 85 percent of the price establishe=
d=20
during the most recent alert.=20
FERC said the system would begin today with a cap of $108.49 a megawatt hou=
r=20
but would rise to $127.64 if a power alert is declared.=20
But the cap can fluctuate significantly. Under the old FERC plan, the price=
=20
cap in May was set at $267 a megawatt hour. The old plan was similar to the=
=20
new system but applied only to California and only kicked in during power=
=20
alerts.=20
With the caps flexible, generators could have incentives to withhold power =
at=20
some plants in order to raise the caps, said Stanford University economist=
=20
Frank Wolak.=20
The FERC plan "still doesn't solve the problem of withholding," said Wolak,=
=20
chairman of the ISO's market surveillance committee.=20
Wolak also said he's afraid FERC will let power generators exaggerate their=
=20
costs in order to bump up the caps.=20
"The good news is, they seem to be more serious," Wolak said of the=20
oft-criticized commissioners. "But given how many times we've been taken in=
,=20
I'm wary."=20
In addition, generators will be allowed to exceed the price caps if they ca=
n=20
justify it to FERC officials. Borenstein said FERC in the past has allowed=
=20
generators to justify just about every price level imaginable, and he's=20
suspicious that the commission will let generators do the same in order to=
=20
evade the new price controls.=20
State officials, while cautiously optimistic about the plan, were upset tha=
t=20
FERC will allow a 10 percent price premium on electricity because of the ri=
sk=20
of selling to the California market.=20
"We recognize that the risk of nonpayment in California continues to be=20
greater" than in other states, the commission said in its written opinion,=
=20
released late Tuesday.=20
Gov. Gray Davis' spokesman, Steve Maviglio, called the premium ludicrous=20
because the state Department of Water Resources has been buying electricity=
=20
ever since the state's troubled utilities exhausted their credit in=20
mid-January.=20
"The state is as creditworthy a buyer as you can get," Maviglio said.=20
Experts said the plan also won't correct the state's energy imbalance.=20
"None of this is going to have much effect on blackouts," Borenstein said.=
=20
"This is solving part of the problem; I'm worried people will think=20
everything has been solved.=20
"The emphasis now has to be on getting California to conserve," he added.=
=20
A spokesman for power generators, Gary Ackerman, said the price controls=20
could worsen shortages this summer and will discourage generating firms fro=
m=20
investing in the new power plants the West desperately needs.=20
Builders "are going to sit on the fence and think about this," said Ackerma=
n,=20
head of the Western Power Trading Forum.=20
Acting in the face of mounting political pressure and unrelenting criticism=
=20
from California, FERC voted Monday to impose round-the-clock price controls=
=20
throughout the 11-state Western region.=20
The FERC plan replaces a three-week-old plan that applied only to Californi=
a=20
and took effect only when power reserves fell to below 7 percent of demand=
=20
and an official "power alert" was declared.=20
By extending the plan to the entire West, experts said the commission=20
probably put an end to the phenomenon known as "megawatt laundering," in=20
which power was shipped out of California and then re-imported. Imported=20
power wasn't subject to the old price controls.=20
The new controls, said consultant Stiffler, "significantly narrow the abili=

State to borrow up to $5 billion to buy energy=20
By Emily Bazar
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published June 20, 2001)=20
State Treasurer Phil Angelides announced Tuesday that he will borrow up to =
$5=20
billion to pay for future power purchases, a move he said was necessary to=
=20
avoid a continued drain on California's budget and cuts in other state=20
programs.=20
Since mid-January, energy purchased by the state Department of Water=20
Resources on the spot market and under long-term contracts has come out of=
=20
the state's general fund, the source of most state spending.=20
Once the loan becomes final by the end of next week, however, energy will b=
e=20
purchased with the proceeds.=20
Made possible by an emergency order from the governor, the loan ultimately=
=20
will be paid off by customers of the state's investor-owned utilities throu=
gh=20
their electricity rates.=20
"In essence, it stops the general fund bleeding," Angelides said.=20
The state has so far committed $8.2 billion from the general fund to=20
electricity purchases. Of that amount, Angelides said the Department of Wat=
er=20
Resources has actually spent about $6.1 billion through June 12 on power=20
purchases, and has received about $900 million back from customers'=20
electricity rates.=20
Officials expect the loan to finance power purchases through September, whe=
n=20
they plan to issue up to $13.4 billion in revenue bonds.=20
The bonds will reimburse the general fund and and pay off the loan.=20
"This gives the state some more running room, some more cushion in case=20
anything goes awry with the bond sale to make sure ... the state does not r=
un=20
out of general fund money, jeopardizing education programs, law enforcement=
=20
programs, children's and health services," the Democratic treasurer said.=
=20
Angelides said he has obtained firm commitments for $3.5 billion from JP=20
Morgan and Lehman Brothers at a blended interest rate of about 4.5 percent.=
=20
If the long-term bonds are not issued by Oct. 31, the interest rate would=
=20
climb to about 7 percent.=20
Lawmakers initially had hoped to close the short-term loan in May and float=
=20
the long-term bonds shortly thereafter. However, Republicans in the state=
=20
Legislature balked at the plan, forcing the delay of the bond sale until=20
mid-August.=20
Rather than wait, Gov. Gray Davis invoked his emergency powers to allow for=
=20
the loan and circumvent the delay.=20
Assembly Republicans don't mind that the governor used his emergency powers=
=20
to expedite the loan, said James Fisfis, a spokesman for the caucus. Instea=
d,=20
he said, they're concerned the loan could backfire and hurt Californians.=
=20
"If the larger bond offering falls through, the penalties and added interes=
t=20
could add up on ratepayers' bills," he said.=20
But Angelides argued that the loan would benefit ratepayers on several=20
fronts: Power generators can no longer argue the state should pay a "credit=
=20
premium" on electricity, he said, and for the most part will not be able to=
=20
walk away from long-term energy contracts that have provisions requiring th=
e=20
Department of Water Resources to obtain external financing by July 1.=20
Outside the Legislature, the announcement drew praise from financial analys=
ts=20
who had criticized the state for buying power with taxpayer money.=20
In late April, for instance, Standard & Poor cited fears over the state's=
=20
mounting power costs when it downgraded California's credit rating on state=
=20
bonds.=20
But S&P managing director Steven Zimmermann called the governor's executive=
=20
order a step in the right direction.=20
"We're very happy," Zimmermann said. "We were very anxious for the state to=
=20
take the general fund out of the energy purchasing position it's been in."=

Dan Walters: Once burned, lawmakers are very wary of Davis-Edison agreement


(Published June 20, 2001)=20
The Capitol's politicians rarely attempt to resolve big, complicated policy=

issues, preferring to occupy their time with relatively trivial matters --=
=20
which also tend to be the priorities of well-heeled and generous interest=
=20
groups.=20
And when they even acknowledge a need to address something big, they'll oft=
en=20
just nibble at the edges rather than confront the underlying conflicts=20
squarely. That's been the pattern on water, transportation, population grow=
th=20
and public education, to name but a few of many examples.=20
The Capitol completed just one comprehensive, or seemingly comprehensive, b=
it=20
of policymaking during the last quarter-century. But the issue on that=20
occasion was electric utility deregulation, which has exploded into an ener=

effect on the Capitol's denizens.=20
Some Capitol old-timers call it "1890 disease," named after the number of t=

1996 bill that created California's fatally flawed system of pricing electr=

groups and then presented to the full Legislature for take-it-or-leave-it=
=20
approval. The measure was passed without a single dissenting vote, even=20
though only a few lawmakers even began to understand its ramifications.=20
It was a huge failure of the legislative process, virtually a dereliction o=

=20
given the history, both veteran legislators and those who came to the Capit=
ol=20
after 1996 are very leery about putting their names on additional pieces of=
=20
energy policy that could backfire if the real-world outcome is markedly=20
different from the purported effects.=20
One example is the $43 billion in long-term energy supply contracts=20
negotiated by Gov. Gray Davis' administration to end the state's dependence=
=20
on volatile spot market prices. When the long-term contracting program was=
=20
authorized by the Legislature early this year, it was on the assurances of=
=20
the administration that it could obtain large quantities of power at cheap=
=20
prices. But by the time that the contracts were made final, months later, t=
he=20
average price was 25 percent higher than what was stated earlier, while the=
=20
spot market had fallen dramatically. Now the long-term contracts that seeme=
d=20
like such a good idea in January and February could become financial=20
albatrosses.=20
An even more telling example is the deal Davis made with Southern Californi=
a=20
Edison to keep the utility from joining Pacific Gas and Electric in=20
bankruptcy. The utilities accumulated at least $13 billion in debts in six=
=20
months, buying power at prices much higher than they were allowed to=20
recapture from their customers. Consumer groups are denouncing the Edison=

deal as a corporate bailout that would impose multibillion-dollar burdens o=

Rosenfield said Tuesday as legislative hearings opened on the Edison deal.=

?????Davis accused FERC of failing to act aggressively against alleged=20

?????"To date, not a single penny in refunds has been returned to=20
Californians," Davis said. "It is unconscionable for the generators to prof=

from their egregious overcharges. FERC must move quickly to enforce the law=

and order the energy companies to give back the money."
?????Davis said the state is owed refunds of at least $6.7 billion.=20
California's grid operator has estimated that from May 2000 to May 2001,=20
power generators charged the state nearly $9 billion more than a competitiv=

?????California, the nation's most populous state, has been hit with a seri=

of rolling blackouts, the bankruptcy of its largest utility, and an economi=

?????Today also marks the day that FERC's newly expanded "price mitigation"=

?????Since FERC's action earlier this week, Senate Democrats dropped a=20

California Democrats in the House were still trying to force a full vote on=

package of energy amendments, including a price cap.
?????The Bush administration and many Republicans oppose price caps,=20
contending they would discourage more power production.
?????Separately, today the U.S. Energy Department issued a study that=20

?????The study found California faces about 113 hours of rolling blackouts=

Reed said.

?????"The situation is that the public's minds are not made up on this=20

Institute of California. "That gives both sides an opportunity to get their=

messages out. The stakes are fairly high in terms of how the public in=20
California ends up assessing blame over the next few months."

?????A Slight Uptick in Davis' Popularity

following a free fall in private polls, Davis has seen his numbers tick bac=

Though Davis and some congressional Democrats portrayed FERC's decision as=

?????Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), a principal sponsor of that bill, on=
=20
Tuesday announced she would shelve the measure for six months to give the n=

FERC plan time to work.
?????As a result, the political effect of the FERC ruling could be to shift=

the focus away from Washington back toward decisions in Sacramento, which i=

exactly what Republicans prefer. "Gray Davis is the dog that finally caught=

?????Davis: 'Much More They Should Do'
?????For months, Davis has criticized Bush for refusing to support=20
electricity price controls and other measures that the governor says could=
=20
ease California's energy crunch. At almost every opportunity, Davis offers=
=20
the same message: California is taking the steps it needs to, but Washingto=
n=20
has failed to help enough. That was precisely Davis' message Monday when FE=
RC=20
significantly expanded the limited price caps it had imposed previously.
?????While saying that FERC had "finally taken a step in the right=20
direction," Davis added: "There is much more they should do"--including=20
providing refunds to California for alleged overcharges. The overall tone o=
f=20
Davis' statement was much more skeptical about FERC's action than the remar=
ks=20
from Feinstein, who described the decision as "a giant step forward."
?????Aides say Davis plans to repeat that two-part message in his appearanc=
e=20
today before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, chaired by Sen.=20
Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.). In his testimony, and in a round of schedule=

television appearances, Davis will demand that FERC order refunds in the=20
range of $5 billion to $6 billion to the state, aides said. Davis also will=

distribute to every member of Congress a 177-page book chronicling the=20
state's response to the crisis.
?????Inside the Bush White House, some officials see in Davis' cool respons=
e=20
to FERC's decision more evidence that the governor is determined to use the=
=20
White House as a foil in his reelection campaign. The prevailing view, one=

official said, is that, no matter what concessions the administration offer=
s,=20
Davis will immediately raise the bar and demand something else--the way he=

did by talking about rebates as soon as FERC offered tougher price controls=

energy strategy. "He asks the administration to do something, the=20
administration does it, and then he attacks the administration for not doin=
g=20
enough. . . . He needs someone to blame."
?????Davis aides reject that characterization, arguing that the governor is=

merely representing the state's interests against an administration that th=

maintain is favoring energy producers over consumers. But Davis advisors=20
acknowledge that they have used focus groups to test campaign messages that=

pin the blame for the energy crunch primarily on Davis' Republican=20
predecessor, Pete Wilson, and a "Republican president who has failed to sto=

said.
?????"You don't have to tell people in focus groups more than once how this=

is connected," the Davis aide said.

?????Gubernatorial Rivals Are Free of Blame
?????Baldassare, the independent pollster, notes it may be especially=20

none of his potential Republican opponents in 2002--California Secretary of=

Blackout Forecasts' Dark Side=20
If optimists are wrong and the power runs out, California's energy crisis=

could quickly cost lives and cripple the economy.=20

By JENIFER WARREN, Times Staff Writer=20

?????It's here. Summer 2001, the blackout season, is only a day away.
?????Already Californians anticipate power outages when temperatures rise. =
By=20
August, the occasional annoyances endured so far--stoplights gone dark,=20
computers, air conditioners and elevators idled--could seem almost quaint.
?????Gov. Gray Davis insists we needn't worry. Four large new power plants=

are firing up soon, he said, and government's best and brightest are lockin=
g=20
up still more megawatts to help meet our peak summer need. Californians,=20
Davis predicts, will valiantly heed his call to conserve, helping the state=

survive the hot months, no sweat.
?????With luck, he'll be right. Power prices have stabilized, and some ener=

analysts are wondering whether California may have tamed the blackout beast=

?????But what if those plants don't get built in time, people don't trim=20
their electricity use 7% and energy imports are more meager than expected?
?????And what if the state gets hit by a summer that is not moderately hot,=
=20
as Davis bets, but blistering, record-setting hot?
?????Government experts who ponder such questions don't expect disaster in=
=20
the coming months. But they are planning for it nonetheless.
?????At best, they say, Californians can expect some gridlocked=20
intersections, an occasionally overloaded 911 system, perhaps some business=

bankruptcies, certainly inconvenience. At worst, the Western power grid cou=

?????"How bad could this summer get?" said state Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana=

"This summer could be the worst disaster to ever hit the state of Californi=

?????Imagine it's a Thursday morning in the third week of July. Relentless=

heat grips California, the curse of a stubborn high-pressure ridge that jus=

?????As air conditioners from Redding to Chula Vista lumber to life, manage=

coffee, stare at a bank of computers and begin to fret.
?????Demand is jumping. Supply is static, Canada and Arizona have nothing t=
o=20
sell. It's looking tight.
?????Thirty minutes later, the picture is gloomier. A brush fire shuts down=
=20
transmission lines near Fresno, squeezing supply in the Central Valley. In=
=20
the Bay Area, the unusual heat drives demand well past projections.
?????By noon things look bleak. Operators of the Diablo Canyon nuclear powe=
r=20
plant near San Luis Obispo have cut output by 80%. The trouble? Chunks of=

kelp have lodged in one of the plant's seawater intake valves, creating a=

clog like one that plagued the facility in January.
?????With a chorus of groans, the grid's keepers scour the market for power=

to offset the Diablo loss. No luck. As the mercury climbs and the Golden=20
State economy roars into full swing, electricity consumption ticks upward,=

minute by minute. And when managers of a power plant near Long Beach cut=20
output because of a cracked turbine, everyone knows what it means.
?????Alert the utilities. It's lights out, California, for the fourth day i=

?????Dr. J. Michael Leary dreads blackouts--not personally, but=20
professionally. Leary is an emergency room physician in the desert city of=

Rancho Mirage. When air conditioners go on the blink there, the=20
victims--scores of them, mostly old folks--wind up in his ER.
?????In a normal year, 75% of his emergency patients are geriatrics. Like=

infants, the elderly are unusually vulnerable to the heat. When blackouts=

hit, they are most at risk.
?????"It's as if you lived in Maine and they turned the heat off in January=

Leary said. "This is an extreme environment we live in. The effects can be=

?????Many desert seniors are on fixed incomes and live in mobile homes, som=

?????For Leary, the specter of continual, back-to-back blackouts in=20
July--and, some predict, in June and August too--conjures images of an=20

effects; one inhibits his body's ability to cool itself.
?????When a person gets overheated, body temperature eventually rises=20
uncontrollably. Then comes a nasty spiral of effects, and pretty soon "you =

into shock," Leary said. "Everything just shuts down."
?????On average each year, 371 Americans die from heat-related causes, more=

than the number killed by earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, lightning and=

Eleven Californians died from the heat in 1998.

?????Out in the desert, paramedics expect a crush of 911 calls when the pow=

Eisenhower Medical Center will be waiting, armed with ice packs, cooled IVs=

?????"I am very, very worried," the doctor said. "I think we'll see a great=

?????California's tomato processors are no less anxious. They wash, cook,=
=20
peel, chop, mash and can about 1 million tons of tomatoes a week from July =
to=20
October--enough to account for half the world's supply. For them, a string =
of=20
unexpected power losses could mean economic ruin in a matter of days.
?????The reason lies in the peculiar nature of food processing--a sterile=
=20
system instantly contaminated if the power fails and the plant's precise=20
temperature is disturbed.
?????Once a batch of tomatoes is tainted, it must be thrown out--all 50,000=

pounds. The plant must then be sanitized, a painstaking process that takes=
=20
about 36 hours.
?????"If you get hit by blackouts every third day for, say, two weeks, you'=

president of the California League of Food Processors. "You could lose thre=

?????Meanwhile, farmers with still more truckloads of tomatoes line up=20
outside the plant, waiting to be paid for their crop: "If we can't process=

them, the farmers have spent an entire season growing them for nothing,"=20
Boese said.
?????In Sonoma County, the object in peril is the chicken. Egg producers=20
equip their laying houses with fans and swamp coolers to keep the hens=20
comfortable. Power is also needed to run giant refrigerators filled with eg=

?????"In a blackout, those hens can overheat in no time," said Rich Matteis=

of the Pacific Egg and Poultry Assn. "In 20 or 30 minutes, you could have=

100,000 birds die."
?????Many large producers have backup generators, but they are not designed=

?????Hundreds of other California businesses could suffer if summer shapes =

as bad as some predict.
?????The Valero Refining Co. of California, northeast of San Francisco,=20
produces 115,000 barrels of gasoline a day. Because restarting a refinery i=

in the same fix. Few have backup generators, so when an outage hits,=20
technicians must crank the machines by hand.
?????Most Californians, of course, face far more ordinary consequences. The=

when restaurants cannot grill salmon or blend margaritas.
?????Most people will tolerate occasional disturbances, psychologists say,=

doing their part in a time of crisis. But what if such irritations become a=
n=20
everyday fact of life?
?????Hundreds of "essential" energy users--including prisons, fire=20
departments and airports--are protected from blackouts, and hundreds more=
=20
have applied for exemptions. That means the pool of people bearing the=20
blackout burden is shrinking, so more frequent outages are likely.
?????Blackout predictions vary widely, but at least one forecaster, a=20
consultant for California water districts, anticipates an outage almost eve=
ry=20
afternoon of every workday this summer if temperatures are unusually warm.
?????Californians are accustomed to trash compactors, giant-screen TVs and=

?????"So far, the version of blackouts we've experienced hasn't looked too=

?????But if outages become daily events, and start to invade the evening=20

?????"When there's a disaster or crisis or trauma, people tend to act=20
heroically and work together," said Robert Butterworth, a Los Angeles=20
psychologist and trauma specialist. "But the civilized behavior only lasts =

?????That tendency may be exacerbated, Butterworth said, by the nature of t=

Sacramento County Sheriff's Lt. Larry Saunders.
?????Lon House is the water consultant who predicts California could see=20

?????"I'm telling them to be ready for a major earthquake every day this=20

?????House insists he isn't an alarmist. But on top of the fire fears, he=

warns that blackouts of more than a few hours would allow air into water=20

FERC Move Short-Circuits Push for Hard Price Caps=20

State to Pay Electric Bill With Loan, Not Taxes=20

no longer see their money evaporate at record rates, under an executive ord=

by Gov. Gray Davis.
?????As early as next week, the order will stop the hemorrhaging of the sta=

electricity. That money is expected to cover power purchases until this fal=
l,=20
when the state plans to sell an unprecedented $12.5 billion in bonds to rep=

?????Angelides said Tuesday that he has already lined up $3.5 billion in=20

?????The loan is critical, he said, because without it, electricity purchas=

?????"In essence, it stops the general-fund bleeding," Angelides said. "Wha=

?????The loan could also ease concerns on Wall Street that California's ris=

State Joins Challenge to Bush on Air-Conditioner Standards=20
Regulations: U.S. rolled back Clinton rule from 30% increase in efficiency =
to=20
20% on manufacturers' urging.=20

By JENIFER WARREN, Times Staff Writer=20

?????California and two other states joined environmentalists Tuesday in=20
suing the Bush administration over its decision to weaken efficiency=20
standards for home air conditioners.
?????The lawsuit caps weeks of criticism heaped on the administration after=
=20
it rolled back a rule requiring manufacturers to increase the efficiency of=
=20
air conditioners 30% by 2006.
?????That rule was adopted by President Clinton during his final days in=20
office and after years of research and debate. California and other=20
states--including Texas--endorsed it as a way to substantially cut energy u=
se=20
and improve air quality.
?????But after reviewing the rule at the industry's behest, Bush=20
administration officials in April sliced the mandated increase to 20%. The=
=20
higher standard, they said, would have made home coolers too expensive,=20
especially for the poor.
?????Conservationists and consumer groups blasted the policy change, callin=
g=20
it shortsighted at a time when California and other states are enduring an=
=20
energy crunch.
?????In California, residential air-conditioning accounts for about 15% of=
=20
the peak energy demand. Weakening efficiency standards, critics say, will=
=20
require as many as 60 new power plants nationwide, four in California.
?????"This is a time when we need to conserve electricity and reduce our=20
dependence on the large energy generators and importers," state Atty. Gen.=
=20
Bill Lockyer said in an interview. "Weakening this standard is precisely th=
e=20
wrong message at precisely the wrong time."
?????In their lawsuit, Lockyer and the attorneys general of New York and=20
Connecticut allege that federal law bars the U.S. Department of Energy from=
=20
softening an appliance efficiency standard. A separate but similar suit was=
=20
filed by the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Consumer Federation of=
=20
America and another nonprofit group.
?????Joe Davis, the Energy Department's deputy spokesman, said there would =
be=20
no immediate comment on the suit, filed in federal court in Manhattan. He=
=20
added, however, that "we believe all of the actions of our decision-making =
in=20
the air conditioner standards are well within the law."
?????When Clinton's rule was issued in January, his outgoing energy=20
secretary, Bill Richardson, said the payoff in power savings and cleaner ai=
r=20
would be one of the administration's greatest environmental achievements.
?????But a trade association representing air conditioner manufacturers=20
challenged the new rule, arguing that it would dramatically increase costs =
of=20
the units--priced between $2,000 and $4,000--and thus discourage people fro=
m=20
replacing old ones.
?????The Department of Energy sided with the industry group in April.=20
Officials said Clinton's proposal would have added $335 to the price of a n=
ew=20
air conditioner, while the lower, 20% standard would boost prices only abou=
t=20
$213.
?????Others, however, say those figures do not take into account the=20

e=20
efficient units. When Congress passed the first efficiency standard for air=

it would increase the cost of air conditioners by $700," said Andrew Delask=

executive director of the nonprofit Appliance Standards Awareness Project. =
In=20

?????Dan Reicher, the assistant secretary of Energy under Clinton who overs=

development of the stricter standards, added that high-efficiency air=20
conditioners "are not some exotic, untested technology."
?????"There are lots and lots of air conditioners already meeting the=20
standards--between 5% and 10% of the units sold today," he said.
?????Although most manufacturers support the Bush rollback, the second=20
largest maker of air conditioners--Houston-based Goodman Global Holding,=20
which produces the Amana brand--opposes it, saying any higher upfront costs=

The FERC's Action Is Good, Bad,Ugly=20
By PETER NAVARRO


?????The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's new wholesale price caps wi=
ll=20
save the Western states literally tens of billions of dollars in electricit=
y=20
bills. As wonderful as that sounds, the FERC order still allows wholesale=
=20
generators to extract enough windfall profits to drive the region into=20
recession.=20
?????The FERC's approach may also perversely lead to more air pollution and=
=20
natural gas shortages.=20
?????Let's look at what the FERC did right. First, the order approved Monda=
y=20
establishes price caps on a 24/7 basis rather than simply during power=20
emergencies--a long overdue reform.=20
?????Second, the order protects the entire West, not just California. This=
=20
regional cap will end "megawatt laundering," whereby in-state generators so=
ld=20
power across California lines and then resold it back into the state to eva=
de=20
caps.=20
?????Third, the order closes the ridiculous broker loophole that made the=
=20
FERC's previous price caps Swiss cheese. Before, generators could redirect=
=20
their sales from the market to energy brokers who were exempt from the pric=
e=20
caps.=20
?????So where did the FERC go wrong? The problem may be traced to the two=
=20
competing methods of imposing price caps and the all-important concept of=
=20
"economic rent."=20
?????Economic rent, in the wholesale electricity market, is the market pric=
e=20
of electricity minus the producer's cost, where cost includes not just labo=
r=20
and fuel but a "fair profit" on the invested capital as well. In traditiona=
l=20
regulation, this fair profit is calculated very simply as the market cost o=
f=20
the money borrowed to build the power plant.=20
?????Under this definition, if the producer's cost is a nickel a kilowatt=
=20
hour and he can sell it for 35 cents--as producers in the West have been=20
doing--the producer can extract 30 cents of economic rent from consumers.=
=20
?????In California, the extraction of such economic rent through market=20
manipulation has taken place on a grand-theft scale. In 1999, California's=
=20
electricity bill was about $7 billion. Last year, it was almost $30 billion=
=20
for roughly the same amount of electricity. This year, California's bill is=
=20
well on its way to $50 billion annually.=20
?????To stop this rip-off, Gov. Gray Davis proposed "cost-based" price caps=
.=20
Such caps are calculated on a plant-specific basis. Each generator is allow=
ed=20
to recover its cost of production, including the fair profit, but not a pen=
ny=20
more.=20
?????Thus, for example, a newer, highly efficient plant generating power at=
 a=20
nickel per kilowatt hour would collect a nickel. The oldest, least efficien=
t=20
plant that generated power for 20 cents would be allowed to collect 20 cent=
s.=20
?????By setting different prices for different plants, the economic rents a=
re=20
driven to zero. Yet each generator still has a fair profit incentive to=20
produce. From a public policy perspective, it's the best of all possible=20
worlds. And it was categorically rejected by the FERC. Instead, the FERC se=
ts=20
a single price for all generators based on the cost of the "least efficient=
=20
plant."=20
?????The obvious problem with this umbrella pricing rule is that it still=
=20
allows generators to extract billions in economic rent from consumers.=20
?????In our previous example, and under the FERC's rule, the least efficien=
t=20
plant still collects 20 cents a unit to recover costs. However, the most=20
efficient plant producing power at a nickel-per-kilowatt also collects 20=
=20
cents rather than a nickel and thus extracts a full 15 cents of economic=20
rent.=20
?????Thus, under the FERC's rule, wholesale generators still will be able t=
o=20
capture tens of billions of dollars more from consumers and businesses than=
=20
under Davis' cost-based rule.=20
?????The FERC's approach is still subject to the same kind of strategic=20
gaming that has been the hallmark of this crisis. Generators will ensure th=
at=20
during peak times, when the price cap is being established, the most=20
expensive possible plant is in operation--whether it needs to be or not. Th=
is=20
will peg the price at the highest level.=20
?????In addition, the FERC provides generators with a perverse incentive to=
=20
run their least efficient units more often. Since these least efficient=20
plants are also the highest polluting, the result will be dirtier air.=20
Moreover, the excessive running of these plants may also put a strain on=20
already stretched natural gas supplies. These least efficient plants use up=
=20
to 40% more natural gas to produce a unit of electricity.=20
?????The bottom line: The FERC "done good." But it could have done a lot=20
better. And the way things stand now, there still is a danger that higher=
=20
electricity costs could push California and the rest of the West--and=20
eventually the nation--into a nasty recession.=20

Circumventing the Legislature, Gov. Gray Davis used his emergency powers=20
yesterday to authorize borrowing up to $5 billion for energy purchases in=

Sidestepping the Legislature with a stroke of the pen, Davis' action=20
indicates that the state may need more time to prepare a $12.5 billion bond=

The Democratic governor's action was swiftly assailed by the Republican=20

"This is not a dictatorship. It's a democracy," said Assembly GOP leader Da=

State Treasurer Phil Angelides said lawyers had advised him and the governo=

that such borrowing could be authorized by an executive order.=20
The loan from Wall Street will temporarily fill the $5.2 billion -- and=20

electricity on behalf of the state's cash-starved utilities in January.=20
The idea is to tide the state over until a larger bond sale of $12.5 billio=

'STOPS THE BLEEDING'=20

The state runs out of internal borrowing power sometime in October. Angelid=

said the loan would buy the state another four to six months.=20
The idea of a loan was floated earlier this year.=20
Cox and other GOP lawmakers objected, wondering why the state should pay=20
interest on borrowed money when it could still borrow from various accounts=

within the state budget.=20
They refused to vote for a bill authorizing the larger bond sale of $12.5=

Angelides had previously said he hoped to sell the bonds in early September=

Yesterday, he said the governor's "hope is to still sell long-term bonds by=

Numerous actions must be completed before the bond sale.=20
Among them are the approval by the Public Utilities Commission of several=

Although Davis' executive order authorizes $5 billion in loans, Angelides h=

So far, only two lenders have come forward to offer the state a loan, J.P=

Easier said than done. To date, California's strategy for tackling its ener=

Now that the federal regulators have gone much of the way toward granting t=

For his part, however, the governor feels that federal regulators have not=

"FERC has taken some first steps, but the proverbial fat lady hasn't sung,"=

said Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Davis.=20
This persistent focus on federal assistance could slow progress toward a=20

Hoge said this could subsequently influence a speedy resolution of Pacific=

State Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco, isn't so sure.=

This would only increase the importance of price caps in bringing some=20

California's energy crisis hits Northwest like a tidal wave=20

http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=3D/chronicle/archive/2001/06=
/20/E
D165509.DTL=20
THERE WAS a time when many Northwesterners thought we could watch=20
California's energy crisis from a safe distance.=20
We have since learned that a major energy crisis does not stop at the Golde=
n=20
State's borders but, instead, rolls over the Northwest like a tidal wave,=
=20
wreaking havoc with our economy and overwhelming our carefully crafted ener=
gy=20
policies.=20
As one Northwest utility official put it, "We learned that everyone else is=
=20
the tail. California is the dog."=20
To understand why the Northwest is now facing its own energy crisis and how=
=20
the energy problems in the Northwest and California each affect each other,=
=20
one must understand how the Northwest gets its power.=20
In the Northwest, falling water is our primary fuel. Depending on the=20
available snowpack, hydroelectricity produced at more than 200 dams in the=
=20
Columbia River basin generates between 60 and 75 percent of the region's=20
electricity. About two-thirds of this hydropower comes from 29 dams owned a=
nd=20
operated by the two federal agencies, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and=
=20
the Bureau of Reclamation.=20
By taking advantage of the region's geography and climate, the Columbia's=
=20
hydroelectric dams have produced some of the least expensive electricity in=
=20
the nation, power that has been the economic backbone of the region.=20
However, the Columbia's hydrosystem also has two curses.=20
One is that water conditions can vary greatly, and right now the Northwest=
=20
and California are in the middle of an extreme drought. The second is the=
=20
dams' negative impact on salmon. These dams operate under a federal salmon=
=20
recovery plan established under the Endangered Species Act that calls for=
=20
more water to be sent over spillways to help push the salmon downstream=20
instead of through the dams' power-generating turbines.=20
That power is sold at cost and transmitted to Northwest consumer-owned=20
utilities by yet another federal agency called the Bonneville Power=20
Administration. These "cost-based" rates cover the expense of repaying the=
=20
U.S.=20
Treasury for the cost of developing these hydropower projects, moving the=
=20
power over massive transmission lines, and supporting efforts to restore th=
e=20
dwindling salmon runs.=20
Under federal law, Northwest consumers get preferred access to the relative=
ly=20
low-cost power. Any surplus power can be sold, most often to California's=
=20
municipal and investor-owned utilities.=20
This Northwest "regional preference" to federal power was part of the deal=
=20
that led to the construction of the massive transmission lines, called "the=
=20
intertie," which first connected the Northwest with California and the=20
Southwest in the late 1960s.=20
For decades, the intertie worked almost flawlessly and to everyone's benefi=
t.=20
During the summer, when air conditioners caused California's power use to=
=20
peak, many California utilities would supplement their needs by turning to=
=20
the Northwest. In the winter, when Northwest electric furnaces are turned o=
n=20
for space heating, California utilities would return the favor and ship the=
ir=20
surplus power north.=20
Recently, the BPA has had to purchase large blocs of power on the wholesale=
=20
market to meet its contractual obligations to its Northwest customers.=20
The same exorbitant wholesale prices that began to plague California last=
=20
year have also affected the Northwest, meaning that the BPA has been runnin=
g=20
out of money, and is now in danger of defaulting on its debt obligations to=
=20
the Treasury.=20
California's deregulation plan has affected energy relations between the tw=
o=20
regions in other ways. For example, the BPA has historically sold surplus=
=20
power to California for relatively low prices. However, the state's=20
deregulation law made it almost impossible for California utilities to ente=
r=20
into favorable long-term contracts.=20
Instead, power had to be purchased at the much higher "market clearing pric=
e"=20
on the short-term spot market.=20
The BPA has taken extraordinary steps to help California keep the lights on=
.=20
At times, the agency even declared energy emergencies, which allowed it to=
=20
temporarily override salmon protections and use the water to generate power=
=20
for California rather than sweep salmon over the dams. California officials=
=20
have praised the BPA for its cooperation, but Northwest environmentalists a=
nd=20
tribal leaders complain that the BPA has been helping California address it=
s=20
energy crisis by selling salmon down the river.=20
The Northwest will be helped by FERC's decision yesterday to extend limited=
=20
temporary price restrictions it had imposed in California in the spring to=
=20
other Western states during severe shortages. The order should also be good=
=20
for California. Without consistent price restrictions throughout the West,=
=20
power marketers would simply skip California during an emergency and sell a=
t=20
higher prices elsewhere.=20
But not everyone is happy with the decision. Many critics say the rates are=
=20
still too high, and some critics said in s published report that the "order=
=20
rewards inefficiency by pegging price ceilings to the costliest California=
=20
gas plants."=20
The half-hearted response from FERC, along with continuing supply shortages=
=20
and other problems make it likely that California will continue to face=20
rolling blackouts and high utility bills -- even though they may not be as=
=20
high as we once feared.=20
The Northwest may follow suit next winter.=20
Some in our region fear that some desperate California political leaders=20
might try to wrest control of the BPA and a large portion of the Columbia=
=20
Basin's hydropower. The 6,600 megawatts of hydropower from the Columbia's=
=20
federal dams would only offer a few drops in the bucket for California's=20

California Gov. Gray Davis demanded that power generators refund nearly $9=
=20
billion in electricity overcharges and complained that federal regulators=
=20
have "looked the other way while energy companies bilked our state."=20
Davis told a Senate hearing Wednesday that the decision by the Federal Ener=
gy=20
Regulatory Commission to curtail price spikes in California and 10 other=20
Western states was a step forward. "But its actions do nothing about the=20
overcharges" over the past year, he said.=20
The governor, a Democrat, has been criticized by Republicans, who charge he=
=20
has allowed the California power crisis to get out of hand.=20
Davis defended his actions, saying the state has stepped up approval for ne=
w=20
power plants and strengthened conservation programs. He also said the state=
=20
has little control over price gouging by out-of-state power generators.=20
"The governor once said he could solve California's problems in 15 minutes.=
=20
... But it appears that California has continued to try and hide the true=
=20
cost of power by having the state pay for it instead of the utilities,"=20
putting California taxpayers in jeopardy, said Sen. Frank Murkowski,=20

Murkowski said many of the alleged overcharges are by public power entities=

Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee=

=20
just and reasonable, as required by the 1934 Federal Power Act.=20
The agency's response to the Western power problem "raises serious question=
s=20
about whether (FERC) has or will oversee the newly deregulated energy=20
markets" not only in the West but across the rest of the country.=20
The federal agency, whose commissioners were to testify later in the day,=
=20
imposed limited, market-based price caps on Monday in California and 10 oth=
er=20
Western states from Washington to Arizona. The agency also ordered the=20
parties to attend a conference next week to try to work out agreements on=
=20
overcharges and other issues.=20
Months ago, the FERC singled out $124 million in alleged overcharges by pow=
er=20
generators. The power companies have since challenged the agency's findings=
=20
and the matter remains in dispute.=20
"To date not a single penny in refunds has been returned to California,"=20
complained Davis. He said that between May 2000 and the beginning of this=
=20
month power generators are believed to have overcharged California $8.9=20
billion.=20
"They must be required to give us back our money," said Davis. "It is=20
unconscionable that FERC looked the other way while energy companies bilked=
=20
our state for up to $9 billion."=20
The state spent $7 billion for electricity in 1999 and $27 billion in 2000=
=20
and is projected to pay nearly $50 billion this year, said Davis. "Power=20
generators have been able to exert extreme power over our energy market," h=
e=20
said.=20
Davis rejected Republican criticism that the state is not addressing the=20
problem. He said newly approved power plants will provide 20,000 additional=
=20
megawatts of electricity by 2003, including 4,000 megawatts by the end of=
=20
this summer. "Everything that can be done to bring reliable, affordable=20

the first challenge in California to Davis' efforts to produce more power.=

The Potrero Hill plant, which runs during times of peak demand, has a total=

Because the peaker plants weren't originally intended to run full time, the=

With that oversight hearing pending this week, the commission called a=20

the commission's plan, ceiling prices will be set that suppliers can exceed=

Commission Chairman Curt H,bert, a Republican, said politics played no role=

But Democrats are eager to point to the shift as evidence that the White=20

enhance, market performance.=20
At this time, FERC also did not order refunds for the unjust and unreasonab=

prices, even though it acknowledged the prices reflected the exercise of=20
market power, which is the ability of a producer to force prices higher. Th=

Federal Power Act requires refunds under these circumstances. But FERC said=
=20
it was unable to find specific instances of firms exercising market power.=
=20
This makes no sense. If FERC finds that prices indicate market power, then=
=20
the generators who bid those prices are exercising market power.=20
Following the implementation of these remedies, conditions in the Californi=
a=20
market deteriorated far beyond what had been predicted by the two market=20
monitoring committees. Even though January and February are the lowest dema=
nd=20
months of the year, average wholesale electricity prices were almost 10 tim=

May, California experienced several days of rolling blackouts and had syste=
m=20
emergencies almost every day during January and February of 2001.=20
IN April, FERC made another round of market rule changes designed to lead t=

just and reasonable prices. However, in response to growing pressure from=
=20
Congress, less than 10 days after these remedies were implemented, FERC=20
enacted its most recent order.=20
Before Congress declares victory, it should verify that FERC's most recent=
=20
plan achieves the following two goals.=20
First, the plan should guarantee that the average price of wholesale=20
electricity paid by California over the next two years is equal to the=20
average price that would occur in a competitive electricity market, with=20
California's current supply and demand conditions and fuel costs. The Feder=
al=20
Power Act requires not just a high probability of just and reasonable rates=
;=20
it requires that they occur with certainty.=20
The second goal is to alter the incentives faced by all market participants=
=20
so that it will no longer be profit-maximizing for a firm to withhold=20
electricity from the market in order to drive up prices.=20
FERC's most recently implemented plan does not achieve either of these goal=
s,=20
although it does come closer than any previous attempts.=20
One solution satisfying both of these goals has been proposed to FERC. In a=
=20
December report to FERC, the Market Surveillance Committee of the Californi=
a=20
ISO proposed a one-time regulatory intervention. This intervention would=20
require that each generator serving California sign a forward contract=20
guaranteeing that California consumers can purchase 75 percent of the=20
generator's expected output over the next two years at a specified=20
competitive benchmark price. Once a firm has signed these forward contracts=
,=20
it is free to sell all remaining energy in the western U.S. wholesale marke=

at whatever price it can obtain.=20
The obligation to provide power under the contracts, and the incentive to=

from withholding power.=20
Unless FERC implements a solution satisfying these two goals, Congress shou=

require FERC to suspend the market-based pricing authority for all supplier=

Easing the crunch on costs of power=20
It could have been worse. Yesterday the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissio=

expanded limited price caps on electricity to cover 11 Western states and t=
o=20
last 24 hours a day during an emergency.=20
This follows an action in April that imposed caps only in California during=

the hours the state declared a power emergency.=20
Under the new rules, "when reserves are below 7 percent in the California=

price that was in effect during the most recent Stage 1 [emergency] called =
by=20
the ISO," the FERC explained yesterday.
The order will last until Sept. 30, 2001.=20
The action came after intense pressure by Democrats and the Bush=20
administration on the FERC, whose three Republican and two Democrat members=
=20
all voted for the new controls.
It also comes after continuing stories about "gouging" by suppliers. On=20
Sunday, the Register reported how Tulsa-based Williams, an energy supplier,=

And after Gov. Gray Davis last week attacked Los Angeles' government-run=20

selling the state power at 'cost'."
The new FERC ruling certainly is better than the demand for across-the-boar=

"They're trying to let the market do the best it can under tremendous=20
pressure," Robert Michaels, a professor of economics at Cal State Fullerton=

"FERC's decision to expand the soft price cap throughout the western grid i=

in a research note. "The expanded soft price cap will have little impact on=

Under the order, wholesale power prices will be limited to 85% of the price=

well as the price for natural gas.=20
Generators, investor-owned utilities and independent power producers,=20
however, can receive more than the proxy price if they can justify the high=
er=20
generation costs. The plan also allows a 10% surcharge on all wholesale pow=

sales in California in order to account for credit risk.=20
In a research note, JP Morgan analysts Jim Von Riesemann and Anatol Feygin=

said that earnings for generating companies "should remain relatively intac=

Robert Winters, a Bear Stearns analyst, said, "The near-term actions by the=

Winters said there were buying opportunities with Williams, "which continue=

"On a relative basis, we believe companies that have locked up much of thei=

-- through toll-free phone lines, through news media updates, and now throu=
gh=20
an expanded, user-friendly rotating outage Web site.=20
All of these sources will tell customers that the outages rotate among=20
electrical circuits across SCE's vast service area for about one hour, as=
=20
directed by Cal-ISO. They will also list the likely affected customer group=
s=20
and communities, and even provide geographic maps outlining the specific=20
neighborhoods. Customers will also be able to access practical tips on how =
to=20
prepare and function safely through outages.=20
Customers can find out the group their home or business is assigned to by=
=20
identifying their alphanumeric Rotating Outage Group Number, which now=20
appears directly under the customer's name and address in the top left corn=
er=20
of the bill's front page. When Cal-ISO predicts possible rotating outages,=
=20
SCE will immediately announce which groups may be affected through its outa=
ge=20
hotline -- (800) 611-1911 -- its Web site -- www.sce.com -- and through the=
=20
news media.=20
When outages are forecasted or actually begin, customers can determine if=
=20
their group is part of the current outage or likely to be included in the=
=20
next round, since SCE generally interrupts groups in numerical order, with=
=20
some exceptions. For example, customers can now hear on the morning news=20
whether Cal-ISO is predicting outages for the day. By calling the hotline o=
r=20
checking www.sce.com, they can learn which groups would likely be interrupt=
ed=20
if circumstances turn out as predicted. If their group number is on the lis=
t=20

e=20
for the likelihood of rotating blackouts affecting their home or business=
=20
that particular day.=20
It should be noted that group numbers may change without advance notice for=
=20
operational reasons or when state regulators revise their policy regarding=
=20
customers exempted from blackouts. SCE will notify customers of such change=
s=20
as quickly as practical.=20
Visitors to SCE's customer Web site, www.sce.com, will find the following=

helpful enhancements:=20
-- The site displays outage group numbers and corresponding communities=20
affected during recent, current, and predicted rotating outage=20
incidents.=20
-- When customers click on the name of a community affected by an outage,=
=20
they are taken to a detailed street map of the affected circuit.=20
-- The Web site offers general outage information and links, including=20
outage preparation and safety tips, grid status information from Cal-=20
ISO, frequently asked questions about rotating outages, and=20
conservation tips.=20
-- A dynamic home-page pop-up window will change messages depending on=20
state power conditions. For example, during a Stage 2 Emergency,=20
customers will be directed to information about potential outages.=20
During a Stage 3 Emergency in which rotating outages are underway, the=20
box will provide a hotlink to group numbers and communities currently=20
affected and likely to be affected should outages likely continue.=20
For customers who don't have Internet access, SCE provides essentially the=
=20
same Web site information through an automated outage phone line, (800)=20
611-1911. This service makes it possible to obtain outage information=20
immediately without waiting. Among major features:=20
-- Customers can call at any time to learn the Rotating Outage Group=20
Number assigned to their home or business.=20
-- When customers experience a power blackout, they can call to determine=
=20
whether they are part of a rotating outage incident or if their=20
circuit has been affected by a routine interruption such as a car or=20
construction accident.=20
-- During rotating blackouts, customers can learn if their circuit is=20
currently affected or may be affected in the coming hours and which=20
portions of specific communities may be affected.=20
-- When customers call, they should have their account number and group=20
number handy. However, if customers call during a rotating outage=20

LOS ANGELES, June 19 -- An order by federal regulators that power generator=
s=20
enter settlement talks with the State of California could open the door to =
a=20
sweeping compromise of the financial issues in the state's power crisis,=20
energy industry analysts and executives said today.=20
But the question that remains -- and it is a vital one, they said -- is=20
whether the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has the wherewithal to for=
ce=20
the warring parties to hammer out an understanding that, at its heart, is a=
s=20
much about politics as about money.=20
The commission on Monday gave California regulators and power generators=20
until July 9 to come up with a plan for settling accounts between the=20
generators and California 's struggling utilities. The power companies are=
=20
owed billions, but the state has accused them of price-gouging. If the=20
parties cannot reach some agreement, an administrative judge will step in a=
nd=20
recommend a settlement to the commission instead.=20
Asked at a Senate hearing in Washington today to clarify what he hoped to=
=20
accomplish as a result of the two weeks of settlement talks, the commission=
's=20
chairman, Curtis L. Hebert Jr., was noncommittal. The parties, he explained=
,=20
need two things for the talks to succeed: a deadline and uncertainty.=20
Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California , expressed skepticism abo=
ut=20
the undertaking. Ms. Feinstein said at the hearing, held by the Senate Ener=
gy=20
and Natural Resources Committee, that she was concerned that the commission=
=20
had laid out ''no rules'' for the talks.=20
''Very little, if any, money has changed hands as a result of prior=20
settlement conferences,'' she said.=20
Many industry executives and state officials have not yet seen the=20
commission's order, and they were scrambling today to figure out exactly wh=
at=20
they were being asked to do.=20
''Without seeing what exactly is in the order, who knows?'' said Sean=20
Gallagher, a staff lawyer for California 's Public Utilities Commission.=20
''But we wouldn't turn our noses up at participating in negotiations.''=20
Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, a=20

he=20
added.=20
''I don't hold high hopes that a settlement would work out,'' Mr. Ackerman=

said, ''but I commend the FERC for taking a stab.''=20
Moreover, the parties to the settlement talks may lack an element vital to=
=20
successful negotiations: trust.=20
Several California entities, including the Public Utilities Commission, are=
=20
investigating whether generators took advantage of consumers by charging=20
excessive prices for power. The Independent System Operator, which runs the=
=20
state's power grid, released a study in March concluding that Californians=
=20
might have been overcharged for electricity by more than $6 billion. One=20
state government negotiator said the California attorney general's office=
=20
could file a suit against the power generators in the next few weeks.=20
And as state officials, including Gov. Gray Davis, continue to hurl attacks=
=20
at the generators, calling them pirates and profiteers, the companies and=
=20
California utilities are blaming legislators, saying they failed to address=
=20
the power crisis quickly enough.=20
In March, Duke Energy, one of the companies the state has accused of=20
profiteering, offered to negotiate a broad settlement, but Governor Davis=

ruled out calling off the state's inquiries as part of any agreement.=20

California . Two new power plants are scheduled to begin producing=20
electricity in weeks. California also has recently secured more than a doze=
n=20
deals for power over the next decade, a move Davis contends will stabilize=

the volatile wholesale market for energy.=20
In short, Davis and his aides say their concerted political strategy and=20
efforts to ease the crisis are beginning to pay off.=20
"The bottom line is that we're stabilizing prices and assuring the power wi=

Whether any or all of those steps will keep the lights on in California thi=

In fact, California 's power shortfall could produce 113 hours of rotating=

WASHINGTON, June 19 -- Three weeks ago George W. Bush addressed a sympathet=

declared that his administration ''will not take any action that makes=20

Today, the White House halfheartedly welcomed action by federal regulators =

impose throughout the West a system that looks and smells a lot like price=
=20
caps -- though the White House said it was something different.=20
''This is not a price control,'' Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman,=
=20
said. ''This is a market-based mitigation plan that now will extend to 11=
=20
Western states.''=20
In fact, it bore some resemblance to a proposal made by 10 leading economis=

who urged a middle ground between fixed prices and a deregulated electricit=
y=20
market. Mr. Davis used their proposal to support his position in favor of=
=20
limited price restraints when Mr. Bush visited California .=20
The White House shift from outright opposition to price controls to its mor=
e=20
nuanced position today exemplifies how Mr. Bush has tempered his embrace of=
=20
completely unfettered markets in recent weeks. He didn't have much choice.=
=20
As the threat of blackouts loomed, demands for action rose from officials o=
f=20
both parties and from consumers in the West. It was almost possible to hear=
=20
sighs of relief at the White House today that the Federal Energy Regulatory=
=20
Commission -- an independent body in the Energy Department -- had moved to=
=20
turn down the political heat.=20
In fact, while some House Democrats are still pressing for firmer caps on=
=20
prices, Senators Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California , and Gordon H.=
=20
Smith, Republican of Oregon, withdrew a bill that would have placed strict=
=20
price controls on electricity sold in Western markets.=20
Senator Feinstein said the White House could call yesterday's regulatory=20
action ''mitigation'' or anything else it pleased.=20
''A rose is a rose by any other name,'' she said today.=20
And a free market is not always free. Two weeks ago the administration said=
=20
it would rescue steel companies and steelworkers who have long complained=
=20
about unfair competition from South Korea, Taiwan, China, Brazil, Germany,=
=20
Russia and Ukraine. The White House defended the action by saying it was th=
e=20
only way for the industry to adjust to a new competitive environment.=20
Last month, with no major announcements at the White House, the Bush=20
administration voted for International Monetary Fund aid to two countries,=
=20
Turkey and Argentina, that (like California ) had made some economically=20
disastrous political decisions.=20
In each case, Mr. Bush's economic orthodoxies were tempered by political=20
realities.=20
The California crisis was one thing when it involved a Democratic governor =
in=20
a state Mr. Bush lost by a million votes; it was another, one of his aides=
=20
conceded today, when congressional Republicans from around the West were=20
warning Mr. Bush that blackouts and sky-high prices could blow up in his=20
first year in office.=20
''We heard from a lot of members of Congress who feared that Republicans=20
would be tarred with worsening the problem, even though it happened on Gray=
=20
Davis's watch,'' the political aide said. ''The president took that on=20
board.''=20
Similarly, the steel decision was partly about enforcing laws against=20
''dumping'' foreign products in the market -- and partly about Mr. Bush's=
=20
desire to convince labor unions not to block his trade agenda. Like=20
Californians coping with higher energy prices, the steelworkers need time t=
o=20
adjust to a new world, the administration said.=20
''Open markets improve the lives of people by increasing opportunity, choic=
e=20
and economic freedom,'' Robert B. Zoellick, Mr. Bush's trade representative=
,=20
said in an interview today. ''But compassionate conservatism also recognize=
s=20
the reality that the effects of rapid change fall harder on some communitie=
s=20
and industries,'' which, he said, need ''vital breathing space to adapt to=
=20
change.''=20
While Mr. Bush expressed deep reservations about I.M.F. bailouts during the=
=20
presidential campaign, the situation seemed a bit more complicated once he=
=20
got to Washington. The State and Defense Departments feared that if Turkey=
=20
were engulfed in economic chaos, and blamed the United States for failing t=
o=20
come to its aid, its leaders might be less inclined to let American fighter=
=20
jets use its territory to mount missions over Iraq.=20
So given the choice between letting the Turkish people pay a high price for=
=20
political mistakes -- Californians take note -- and weakening American=20
pressure on Saddam Hussein, Mr. Bush decided that economic niceties were le=
ss=20
important than political consistency. Mr. Bush chose the Pentagon over the=
=20
Treasury.=20
Administration officials said these actions did not represent a retreat fro=
m=20
let-the-markets-prevail orthodoxy.=20
Lawrence B. Lindsey, Mr. Bush's chief economic adviser, said in an intervie=
w=20
today that he opposed price caps at the beginning of the California crisis=
=20
and that he opposed them now. But he would not criticize the federal=20
commission for ''mitigating'' price spikes in the market.=20
''What they are trying to do is achieve two incompatible missions --=20
preserving what is called 'just and reasonable pricing' and assuring an=20
adaquate supply of electricity ,'' Mr. Lindsey said. Yet the reality, he=20
added, is that new supplies of electricity will not become available for a=
=20
year or more. ''FERC is doing its best to square that circle in the face of=
=20
the fundamental problem, which is inadequate supply,'' he said.=20
That is the kind of argument that keeps economists happily arguing for hour=
s.=20
It is not likely to be the kind of argument Mr. Bush himself is likely to=
=20
engage in for long. As one of his political advisers said the other day,=20
''Don't think about this purely in terms of megawatts. We need to produce=
=20
more electricity , but we also need to produce some more seats in the=20
House.''=20
