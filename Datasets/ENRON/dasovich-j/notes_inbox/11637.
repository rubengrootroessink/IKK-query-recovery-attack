CRIMINAL PENALTIES ON ENERGY PRODUCERS=20

CMTA and other interested parties met with staff from the offices of=20
Assemblymember Dennis Cardoza and Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante to=20
discuss onerous provisions in ABX2 65 (Cardoza D-Merced) that would impose=
=20
severe criminal penalties on energy producers.

Amendments taken in the Assembly Appropriations Committee on July 19 delete=

references to petroleum products, coal and coal products, and limit the bil=

OVERPAYMENT REFUNDS TO PAY FOR TRANSMISSION LINE UPGRADES=20

Assemblymember Sarah Reyes (D-Fresno) has amended her ABX2 78 to use any=20
overpayment refunds ordered by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission=20
(FERC) for payment of principal and interest on bonds, to upgrade electrici=
ty=20
transmission lines and to reimburse ratepayers.=20

CMTA and the California Chamber of Commerce opposed the measure in the=20
Assembly Energy, Costs and Availability Committee on July 17, asserting tha=
t=20
100 percent of the refunds should proportionately be returned to the=20
ratepayers who have shouldered the burden of elevated energy prices.=20

As introduced, ABX2 78 required 50 percent of the overpayment to be returne=
d=20

EXIT FEES ON NONCORE GAS CUSTOMERS=20

CMTA and other business groups are working with Assemblymember Pescetti=20
(R-Rancho Cordova) during the Legislature=01,s Summer Recess to amend his A=
BX2=20

The measure also expedites the review process for approval of gas facilitie=
s,=20
and requires pipelines within the state to meet the test that every custome=
r=20
would expect to be curtailed not more than once every ten years, which=20
increases the current standard of once every five years.=20
?=20

INITIATIVE TO LOWER NATURAL GAS PRICES CLEARED FOR SIGNATURE GATHERING=20

A ballot initiative to expand the entities that can buy and sell natural ga=

FED-OSHA HOLDS PUBLIC FORUM ON ERGONOMICS AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY=20

The Department of Labor held the third and final public forum on ergonomics=
=20
at Stanford University in Palo Alto on July 24.? Following the repeal of th=
e=20
federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) ergonomic rule by Congres=
s,=20
Secretary of Labor, Elaine Chao promised that public forums would be held i=
n=20
several locations to explore the issue of developing an ergonomic standard.=
?=20
The forum follows a major victory for California employers when on July 19=
=20
the California Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board unanimously=
=20
rejected a petition from organized labor to adopt the overturned federal=20
Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) ergonomic rule.=20

The forum began with opening remarks by Assistant Secretary of Labor, Chris=
=20
Spear who explained the purpose of the meeting and Secretary Chao expressed=
=20
interest in trying to obtain the best information and ideas available.?=20
Federal OSHA requested that comments be focused on three questions: 1) What=
=20
is an ergonomic injury? 2) How can the Occupational Safety and Health=20
Administration, employers and employees determine whether an ergonomic inju=
ry=20
was caused by work-related activities or non-work-related activities; and, =
if=20
the ergonomics injury was caused by a combination of the two, what is the=
=20
appropriate response? and 3) What are the most useful and cost-effective=20
types of government involvement to address workplace ergonomics injuries=20
(e.g., rulemaking, guidelines, best practices, publications/conferences,=20
technical assistance, consultation, partnerships or combinations of such=20
approaches)?=20

Panels began with organized labor representatives who criticized the repeal=
=20
of the ergonomic rule and urged the Secretary to quickly adopt new rules to=
=20
protect workers.? The second panel was made up largely of educators and=20
scientists who have studied the ergonomics issue extensively and believe th=
at=20
the science does not justify an ergonomic standard such as the federal OSHA=
=20
rule.? The third and final panel was a mixture of employers, employer=20
associations, medical professionals, organized labor, university=20
representatives, professional safety organizations, and individuals, which=
=20
provided vastly contrasting views on the merits of ergonomics rules in the=
=20
workplace.=20

Employers resisted the federal rule stating that it was based on dubious=20
science that cannot accurately identify the cause of repetitive motion=20
injuries attributable to work.? Further, employers stressed that California=
=20
already has the only ergonomic regulation (Title 8, CCR 5110) and the only=
=20
illness and injury prevention program (Title 8, CCR 3203) in the nation,=20
already protecting California workers. Hopefully, Secretary Chao will take =

ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION AT THE BREAK=20

The week of August 20 promises to be a busy one, with several measures=20
scheduled for late policy committee hearings.? Among them, SB 72, Senator=

Sheila Kuehl=01,s (D-Santa Monica) stormwater monitoring bill, which was pu=
t=20
over in Assembly Environmental Safety following a last-minute push for majo=
r=20
amendments by bill sponsor Heal the Bay.? It is unclear at this time what=
=20
form the bill will take for the August 21 hearing. AB 1390, a controversial=
=20
environmental justice measure by Assemblymember Marco Firebaugh (D-East Los=
=20
Angeles), will be heard in Senate Environmental Quality.? AB 1390 is=20
pre-determinative of the state-level program reviews required by SB 115=20
(Solis, 1999) and SB 89 (Escutia, 2000).=20

Cleanup language on the state=01,s greenhouse gas registry program, establi=

last year by SB 1771 (Sher), is now in limbo following Senator Sher=01,s=20
(D-Stanford) decision to use SB 532 for a renewable energy initiative.? The=

1771 registry program language.=20

Among significant late entries in the environmental arena include:=20

SB 471 (Sher), discussed in last week=01,s Legislative Weekly, amended on J=
uly 5=20
with Proposition 65 language and passed out of Assembly Environmental Safet=
y=20
on July 10.? The bill contains language that invites multiple lawsuits for=
=20
the same alleged violation, even in the face of a court-approved settlement=
.
AB 1329 (Lowenthal D-Long Beach) last amended on June 26 and again on July =
9=20
to place further restrictions on handling and treatment of oily wastewater.=

To quote the Senate Environmental Quality Committee analysis, the sponsors=

information that demonstrates they are solving an environmental protection=

ABX2 60 (Daucher R-Brea & Hollingsworth R-Murrieta), last amended on July 1=

=20
The intent of the bill is to help stabilize the grid when a rotating outage=

despite the lack of outages during the critical months of May and June, thi=
s=20
bill is getting political traction, passing out of Assembly Energy Costs an=

Of course, there is still plenty of opportunity for last-minute mischief,=
