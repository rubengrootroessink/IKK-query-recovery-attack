By Nigel Hunt

?? LOS  ANGELES, Sept 7 (Reuters) - The cap on wholesale power prices in=20
California  could be cut for the third time this year, this time to $100 pe=
r=20
megawatt hour  after starting the year at $750 per MWh.

?? The  state's Electricity Oversight Board (EOB) is to make a request to t=
he=20
California  Independent System Operator (ISO) within the next few days on t=
he=20
issue  following a resolution by the state's lawmakers last week.

?? "We will  make a formal request within the next few days," EOB Executive=
=20
Director Gary  Heath said.

?? An  assembly joint resolution approved last week called on the EOB to=20
direct the ISO  to "show cause why the price caps in the ancillary services=
=20
and real-time energy  markets should not be lowered to $100 per megawatt-ho=
ur=20
immediately and continue  until at least March 31, 2001."

?? The cap  currently stands at $250 per MWh after previous cuts from $750 =
to=20
$500 and $500  to $250 amid growing consumer unrest about skyrocketing=20
electricity bills and  allegations of possible price gouging by generators.

?? The  assembly resolution says the EOB should report back to the=20
legislature by  December 1, 2000.

?? There was  heavy criticism of the ISO, which controls most of the state'=
s=20
power grid, by  lawmakers this year at its governing board twice rejected=
=20
resolution to cut the  cap to $250 from $500 before finally agreeing to suc=
h=20
a move.

?? Heath  noted the EOB at a meeting last week decided not to approve the=
=20
appointment or  reappointment of 13 members of the ISO board and 12 members=
=20
of the California  Power Exchange's governing board.

?? "We are  trying to place people who are a bit more mindful of the=20
implications of board  decisions on Californian consumers," Heath said.

?? Existing  board members will remain in office until replacements can be=
=20
appointed.

?? Heath  said that some individuals who were rejected may eventually be=20
approved and the  EOB was rather making a statement about the performance o=
f=20
the two boards.

?? "The  board was making a very clear statement that we are not satisfied=
=20
with the the  efforts of the ISO or PX governing boards to proect Californi=
an=20
consumers,"  Heath said.

?? Wholesale  power prices in California soared to record levels during a=
=20
heatwave in June and  many customers in San Diego faced a tripling in their=
=20
electricity bills.

? Supporters of  cutting the cap believe the power market is not "workably=
=20
competitive" and  prices rose to excessive levels during the heatwave,=20
putting an unfair burden on  both ratepayers and shareholders of investor=
=20
owned utilities.

?? Opponents  have been led by independent power producers who have argued =
a=20
lower cap could  make it more difficult for the state to import power at=20
times of shortage.

?? Emergency  legislation signed into law by Calif. Gov. Gray Davis on=20
Wednesday imposed a  price cap on how much San Diego residents should pay=
=20
which was less than a third  of the current "free market" rate.

? Customers of  San Diego Gas and Electric, a unit of Sempra Energy <SRE.N>=
,=20
had been  exposed to market based prices under the terms of California's=20
power  deregulation.

?? Rates for  customers of California's other two investor owned utilities,=
=20
Edison  International's <EIX.N> Southern California Edison and PG&E Corp.'s=
 =20
<PCG.N> Pacific Gas and Electric, are frozen.

?? A  spokesman for the California ISO was not immediately available for=20
comment.
