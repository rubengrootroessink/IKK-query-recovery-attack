Jeff,
I apoligize for pestering you again about this, but we found a typo and misc. 
exhibit numbering error in your declaration.  Please treat the attached 
version as the final for signature.  Thanks.

Please call me when you have recieved this so that we can get it signed up 
and prepared to file.

--Kristen
