All,

To obtain the LighTrade petition and other filed documents, follow these 
instructions:  Access the DPUC website http://www.state.ct.us/dpuc/.  Choose 
"docket database" then "active docket database".  Next choose "telecom."  The 
docket number is 00-08-13, but save your self some time by clicking on the 
"search" feature.  Type in "lightrade" and hit "okay".  It will pull up all 
that has been filed to date.

Pls. note that I received a call just a few moments ago from the case 
coordinator.  She informed me that a draft decision has been made and she 
will post it within the next hour.  It should appear in the same place that I 
have described above.

Thanks.

I am having trouble getting to the document. I get diverted to the commission 
website.  I go to dockets for telecomm and then I don't know what docket # to 
look for.  Help.

Subject: Re: LighTrade Issue

I had a conversation yesterday with Brian Fitzgerald, local counsel in CT, 
regarding the LighTrade issue.  He informed me that LighTrade has been 
successful thus far in its argument that it should not be regulated by the 
DPUC due to its intent:  LighTrade does not intend to provide the actual 
bandwidth to customers.  Instead, it wants to establish connections between 
various points as a service to those companies that sell bandwidth.  Brian 
has offered to monitor this issue for us.  I told him that we would let him 
know if we wanted him to do that.

Additionally, please use this link to access the LighTrade petition and other 
documents that are posted on the DPUC's website.  If you have difficulty with 
this link, please let me know.

I wanted to pass this along in the event you might find this useful.

Thanks.
