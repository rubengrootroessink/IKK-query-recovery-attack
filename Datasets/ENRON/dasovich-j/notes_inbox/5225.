Dave,

Today we entered into an agreement with CDWR.  A condition of any new deal 
was payment for power deliveries already made.  We received $10.9MM today so 
we executed a 200MW Peak NP-15 Sale from Feb24-Mar31.  CDWR gave us an option 
until Mar28 to extend the deal for five years (at a lower price).  This gives 
us the opportunity to work out the credit issues.  

I plan on speaking with Freeman early next week to re-engage on credit issues 
/ Pastoria / other deals.  

Chris
