Monday, last week, I urged our retail coalition, Alliance for Retail Energy 
Markets (AReM), to hold a press conference this week to draw media attention 
to the CPUC's vote on Thursday to suspend direct access.  AReM and its PR 
Firm agreed.  After a lot of work to line up customers, the press conference 
was held Tuesday morning in Scaramento.

We had excellent turnout from customer groups.  Public statements of support 
for continuing direct access were made by the California Chamber of Commerce, 
CA Manufacturing and Technology Association, CA Large Electric Consumers 
Association, CA Retailers Association, School Project for RR (SPURR - forget 
the whole acronym but the org purchases gas and electricity for aggregated 
elementary and high schools), QUALCOM, City of Palm Springs, NYMEX, and the 
ESPs of Green Mountain, New Energy , Enron (me), and Strategic Energy.  All 
the major papers were there, San Jose Mercury News, SF Chronicle, LA Times, 
SD Union, OC Register, Wall Street Jr.  Also there were the energy trade 
press, Bloomberg, Public Radio and a capitol TV station.  All had the 
opportunity to ask questions of the customers.

As planned, we let the customers take the limelight.  They made forceful 
cases for why the CPUC should not suspend DA and stressed that the 
Treasurer's concerns have been addressed in legislation (that has not yet 
been acted on) and are actively being negotiated at the Capitol.  They urged 
the CPUC not to take this action. I'll forward any media that results from 
this
