The Southwest Power Trading Forum met yesterday to discuss in detail the two 
draft filings that are planned for submission in the Southwest.  A great deal 
of interest was expressed in evolving the ad hoc group into a viable 
organization dedicated to advocating issues and addresssing filings as they 
arise in the southwest.  A task force was formed in order to explore a 
two-tier member organization structure with an opt in/opt out feature for 
members.  The catalyst to this discussion was that SRP is in the process of 
forming a "competitive generation coalition" in Arizona to effectively 
control any efforts related to state tax legislation and eventually RTO 
activity.

Reliant offered information concerning their meeting with FERC and indicated 
that Massey likes the RTO West model and believes it was a collaborative 
process that other western RTO's can utilize as an example.  Carl Imparato 
expressed his concerns with RTO West citing transmission access and the scope 
of duties as the two main problems with RTO West.  With respect to 
transmission access, FTRs are assigned to the incumbents but the incumbents 
are not required to put them up for auction.  With respect to the scope of 
duties the RTO does not offer all FERC jurisdictional services including 
generation interconnection and low voltage sections of the grid.

The group submitted a letter to the DSTAR advisory committee meeting today 
and plans to submit it to the Board tomorrow that essentially requests 
immediate attention and resolution to the issues prior to the December 
filing.  There are approximately 50 problems that require resolution 
(approximately 80 problems in the filing IOU documents) and if left in their 
current state would undermine the basic objective of the RTO.  The issues 
fall into the following five categories:

? Insufficient Scope of RTO Authority
? Foreclosure of Meaningful Transmission Access to the DSTAR Grid
? Undue Discrimination Against Non-Incumbent Uses of the DSTAR Grid
? Inefficient and Inequitable Pricing Mechanisms
? Restrictions on RTO Independence.

A draft of the letter is attached for your review.  Please let me know if you 
have any questions.
