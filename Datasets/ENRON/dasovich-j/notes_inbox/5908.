I think this is a great document to circulate to the larger group.  Thanks.

I forwarded this to you so that you could have a chance to take a peek at it 
before forwarding along to the rest of the group.  If you'd like me to 
forward it along to the larger group, just let me know.

Jeff

Hi Sue:

A very happy new year to you.  Mr Kean has had me underwater since last 
Thursday night, but I'll resurface tomorrow, at which time we can catch up on 
a number of things, including bills.  But I wanted to forward along Steve's 
memo that we discussed just prior to Xmas.  Hope you had a great holiday and 
that all is well.

Best,
Jeff
