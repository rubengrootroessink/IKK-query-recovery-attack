Wow, thanks Dylan.  I thought that I was on the hook for this one.  Let me 
know what I can do to help.  I've read it and will look at what Mark's done 
and throw my 2 cents in. I'll be working on it tomorrow morning.

Best,
jeff

Hey guys,

I just got this.  I will work on it tonight and send it to you later.  I 
agree that we should put it to bed soon.  I suggest that we let Jimmy be in 
charge of the colored graphs so that he can use his artistic side.

Dylan
