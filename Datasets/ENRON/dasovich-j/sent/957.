Greetings Diane:

Well, the TeleBears on the Web seems to be experiencing some "technical 
difficulties" and I've thus far been unable to register.  I'll keep trying!  

In the meantime, I want to make sure that I don't miss any deadlines for the 
1-unit courses.  I intend to sign up for the E291-B course (Speaking for 
Management).  When do I need to sign up by?  Thanks.

Best,
Jeff
