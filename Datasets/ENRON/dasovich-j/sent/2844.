		 Subject: Update from EES Call this Morning

EES' receivables related to PX-credit payments that PG&E continues to 
withhold has grown dramatically
EES is going to meet internally to re-visit the issue of putting customers 
back on utility service (but honoring the financial terms of our contracts)
They will try to convene a meeting, as early as Tuesday to discuss the 
switch-back issue w/Steve, Mark, Blachman, Sunde, etc., similar to the 
meeting held a couple of weeks ago
Given the market's negative response to the Commission's decision, EES will 
immediately try to tie up bankruptcy counsel in anticipation of the fact that 
the utilities may be forced to file, which EES estimates will occur by end of 
next week, if it happens
