As you know, we've been working for about an eternity to unbundle SoCalGas'=
=20
system.  90+% of the industry agreed to an unbundling solution and filed it=
=20
as a settlement at the Commission.  In opposition, muni generators and TURN=
=20
supported SoCalGas' original proposal to essentially maintain the status qu=
o=20
(SoCalGas eventually came over to our side, as did Southern California=20
Edison). =20

A judge's proposed decision came out the day before Thanksgiving adopting t=
he=20
settlement advocated by the muni generators and TURN. =20

If it weren't for the continual barrage of retrograde policy pronouncements=
=20
coming from the "new" California PUC, folks would be genuinely shocked by t=
he=20
judge's proposed decision, but as things are, it was somewhat expected.

There's one silver lining:  We managed to get in both settlements an=20
identical provision that eliminates a substantial amount of financial risk =
TW=20
would have faced but for the provision.  So from that perspective, the choi=
ce=20
to go with the TURN/muni settlement and embrace the status quo does no harm=
. =20
It does considerable harm, however, when compared to the significant value=
=20
that would have been created if the judge adopted the the unbundling=20
settlement.

We have a chance to go on the record in a trade publication "California=20
Energy Markets."  Recent events might persuade us to keep a low profile=20
generally at this point.  On the other hand, perhaps the time is right to=
=20
start coming out of our corner just a bit and pointing out the very poor jo=
b=20
this Commission is doing in managing California's energy policy.  I'm=20
squarely on the fence at this point and am seeking feedback.  A proposed=20
comment is attached. =20

Two questions:

1) Do folks think that there's value in providing a comment?

2) If so, does this statement work, or do folks have suggestions?

Thanks,
Jeff

"The California Public Utilities Commission has a choice. It can adopt the=
