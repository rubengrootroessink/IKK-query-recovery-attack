Agree.  I think she's already gotten a helluvalot better--a marked and very 
positive change.  Reflection and realization are powerful things.

I'll bring all the paperwork over tonite.  We can go over it then.  It 
actually adds up, as far as I can tell.  It was fun as hell, but it sure 
weren't cheap.

Best,
Jeff

You're right on, what you said yesterday about Cameron's taking 
responsibility for herself, instead of passing off the blame. But, that's 
exactly why this whole thing has been good for Cameron. She sees this part 
of her that isn't fair or compassionate, and really wants to change it. 
Pinning it on her father only makes her see clearly that it isn't healthy. 
Half the battle is realizing that these are patterns instilled from sources 
outside, things she needs to correct, and then move away from. We all go 
through that very difficult process. "Blame" needs to arise before one can 
move beyond into a better place. I think we'll all see her try to be better 
than she's been.

As for the bill, don't you think that's high? One night, the dinner, 
Cameron's rental, and lift tickets should come to about $500, no? How much 
was your half? Did they provide you with a break-down of the charges? I 
don't mean to be a pain, but I don't really trust their methods after this 
debacle.

Cheers,

Scott
