Greetings:
Wow, lots of fun out there, eh?  Don't know what it will be like without 
Steve Peace around any more....

I have a very mundane question, though.  What prices for intrastate capacity 
did the PUC finally come up with in the Sempra BCAP for large generators 
under the new "Sempra-wide" rate doctrine?  Thanks a million.

Best,
Jeff
