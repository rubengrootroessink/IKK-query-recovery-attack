		 Subject: meeting?

Hi, all---
You may already know this, but I wanted to keep you updated.  All new 
commodity (power) business in California has been put on hold.  Yesterday, 
Eric Letke announced to the team of originators that we would be suspending 
new efforts until the regulatory/legislative environment is more solid in 
California.  

With that news, all of our team meetings and conference calls have been 
cancelled.

However, I want to maintain a weekly call (30 min max) on our own....just to 
keep-in-touch. 
I will defer to your schedules.  
Please tell me what day and hour looks best for you.  
OR
Is there an existing call that we could join?
I just don't want to lose focus.

Participants:
Regulatory Affairs (Harry, Jeff, Sue, Robert)
Market Development (Marcus Dotson, Jennifer Rudolph, Ed Hamb)

Thank you!
