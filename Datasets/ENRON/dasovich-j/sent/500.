Thanks, Sarah.  Question:  Could we, and should we, attempt to pre-empt the 
FERC report and try to get press coverage of the BP paper before FERC 
releases the results of its investigation?

This is just a rumor, but we heard on the EPSA call today that Scott Miller 
is trying to get his report on the California part of his investigation to 
the Commissioners by Friday of this week.  

Also, the EPSA/Boston Pacific paper continues to be revised, but EPSA wants 
to get it to FERC as soon as possible (but if Scott completes his report by 
Friday it may not be in time for Scott's report), so they have asked us to 
review the report and Executive Summary and get comments back to them for a 
conference call on Friday.  Since we will be at FERC during the EPSA call, we 
will need to get any comments we may have to Julie by Thursday evening or 
Friday morning.

Thanks everyone.

Sarah

FROM: Don Santa, Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair

            Julie Simon, Vice President of Policy

RE: Boston Pacific Statistical Research Project

Attached is the latest draft of the full Boston Pacific statistical research 
project, reflecting the comments made by EPSA members.  Both clean and 
redlined versions are attached.  There are two major changes in the project: 
1) the seven-page summary is the Executive Summary of the report; and 2) all 
cost estimates for new peakers have been removed.

Please review the documents so we can discuss them on a conference call on 
Friday, October 6th at 11:00 a.m. EST and then release it to Scott Miller for 
the FERC investigation.  Please dial 1-800-937-6563 and ask for the Julie 
Simon/EPSA call.  If you have any questions or comments, please contact Julie 
Simon at 202-789-7200 or jsimon@epsa.org before the Friday call.
