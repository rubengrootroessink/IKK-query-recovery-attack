No worries.  I'm not going anywhere.  Focus on you.  If you're body's 
reacting poorly, swift action is warranted.  If there's anything I can do to 
help, don't hesitate. Hang in there.

Best,
Jeff

Thanks Jeff-
I really appreciate the talk and your perspective. 
I'm still undecided about school, still need to have
the talk with my contact guy at eLoyalty.  Planning on
that for Friday.  No decisions, lots of open emotional
stuff going on.  I would like to grab lunch or
whatever at some point, but not in the real near
future...I've got to settle my schedule a bit or I'm
going to literally pass out.  My body is reacting to
the abuse quite badly.  Maybe if I get back on the
beach in a week or two!  Anyway-talk to you later and
thanks again-
