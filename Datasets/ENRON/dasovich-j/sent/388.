I was holding back a bit.  All I needed was the green light.  I'll make it 
explicit.  Thanks for the comments.

I am very ready to start getting the word out.

Best,
Jeff

Looks good.  I think you implicitly say this, but I think you should make it 
more explicit:

The continued growth of the new economy is threatened by our electricity 
infrastructure more than anything else.
The high tech industry requires market driven solutions to reliability and 
pricing not the old style command and control regulated monopoly approach.
Let's start getting the word out!
