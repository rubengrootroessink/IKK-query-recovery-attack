FYI.  I'll be participating in a "round table discussion" on California next 
Monday on the Berkeley campus.  It's being sponsored by the Policy School and 
some folks from the Business School.  Laura Tyson and a former FCC mucky-muck 
(Howard Shalansky) will moderate the two panels.  Alums who now work in the 
energy biz are putting up funding for the event (e.g., Columbia, American 
Public Power Ass.)  We're providing a modest stipend.

There are two "round tables."  First one is "Why did we do this?," and the 
second one is "Where to from here?"  I'll be on the second panel.  Go to the 
attached website for agenda and other info.  I intend to pull from the 
messages, filings and other materials that we've developed over the course of 
the last several weeks/months.  I'll distribute talking points for review and 
comment sometime this week.  But please feel free to send thoughts, 
suggestions, etc. early and often.  

Best,
Jeff
