=09=09 Subject: Transcript of a bizarre and unusual telephone call from the=
 ISO=20

Here is the transcript of the ISO's real-time desk asking Enron real-time=
=20
trader Ryan Slinger to help the ISO "set" the market-clearing price ("MCP")=
=20
for replacement energy.  The ISO wanted Enron to help set the MCP for=20
replacement energy at $91.86, because the ISO was upset that the MCP had=20
dropped to a penny, and now market participants were buying the ISO's exces=
s=20
energy a penny (after having sold it to the ISO for $91 the day before).

There are two phone calls.  The first call is the ISO calling to ask us to=
=20
help it to set the price.  The next call occurs three minutes later and is=
=20
the ISO calling because we didn't put in the bid.  Our trader told the ISO=
=20
that he had to "talk to his boss" because he "didn't want to do anything=20
wrong." =20

Note:  I have just learned a complicating detail:  Coincidentally, our desk=
=20
did put in a bid for $91.86 for Hour 18, which was what the ISO had=20
requested.  However, the bid had been formulated before the ISO called our=
=20
desk.


Transcription of a telephone conversation between the ISO=01,s Real Time De=
sk=20
and Enron=01,s Real Time Desk - July 3, 2001, 14:40:50 - 14.43:38

Enron:  Enron, this is David [Porter].

ISO:  Hi David.  This is Allen at the ISO.

Enron:  David: Hi Allen.  How ya doing?

ISO:  Allen:  Hold on one sec.  I=01,ve got to get something.

Unknown:  Stage one at 11.

ISO:  Allen:  Hey, I=01,m on the hour-ahead desk.  Did you guys put a bid i=
n?

Enron:  David:  Yes, hang on one second Allen.

ISO:  Allen:  Yeah.

Enron:  Ryan:  This is Ryan [Slinger].

ISO:  Allen:  Hey Ryan, this is Allen at the ISO hour ahead.  Did you guys=
=20
put a trade in, replacement [energy]?  Not trade, but a bid?

Enron:  Ryan:  For which hour, for hour 15?

ISO:  Allen:  For hour 16?

Enron:  Ryan:  For hour 16, correct.

ISO:  Allen:  Can you guys continue to put the price at that?

Enron:  Ryan:  At what?  At $91.86?

ISO:  Allen:  Yes

Enron:  Ryan:  Um,=01(.

ISO:  Allen:  This isn=01,t on a recorded line, but we wanted to do that be=
cause=20
of some of the things that we are seeing.  It would be good to keep it [the=
=20
Market Clearing Price for Replacement Energy] at a higher price.  It doesn=
=01,t=20
matter how many megawatts you  put it at, but we want to clear it at a high=
er=20
price.

Enron:  Ryan:  Wait, you said we=01,re not on a recorded line, or we are?

ISO:  Allen:  We=01,re not.  No, we=01,re not, okay.  We already talked to =
the=20
day-ahead research guy and myself, but we saw you guys clear at $91 and we=
=20
wanted you, if it=01,s possible, to continue to set that, whether it=01,s 2=
0 MW or=20
whatever you want to put in there.

Enron:  Ryan:  Okay, um=01(..

ISO:  Allen:  We want to clear it at that because of some issues we are=20
seeing as far as others that are taking advantage of the market.

Enron:  Ryan:  Oh yeah.  Because it had been clearing like at $100, hadn=01=
,t it?

ISO:  Allen:  Not replacement.

Enron:  Ryan:  Oh, not replacement?

ISO:  Allen:  No.  What happened is that we bought it back=01(.see, the=20
day-ahead was purchased at like $100 and then what happened is that the=20
hour-ahead . . .a bunch of these  people were buying it back for a penny ov=
er=20
the [inter] ties.  They were faking it.  So we wanted to keep the price up=
=20
high.  =20

Allen and Ryan:  Unintelligible.

Enron:  Ryan:  So they were selling it, oh, in the day ahead, and buying it=
=20
back=01(.

ISO:  Allen:  Buying like 60 bucks. . . trying to make money off of it, the=
n=20
basically they are trying to buy it back at a penny.

Enron:  Ryan:  Oh, that=01,s ridiculous.

ISO:  Allen:  That=01,s really ticking us off and right now . . .

Enron:  Ryan:  That to me signals, that=01,s probably Powerex, isn=01,t it?

ISO:  Allen:  There=01,s about four of them right now.

Enron:  Ryan:  Shit.

ISO:  Allen:  And for the day-ahead for tomorrow, we didn=01,t, we didn=01,=
t, we=20
took them out.  Basically, we=01,re not allowing  anything over the ties.

Enron:  Ryan:  I didn=01,t submit one for 17 or =01(.

ISO:  Allen:  That=01,s fine.  They=01,ll probably go to a penny and they=
=01,ll=20
probably get excited and do a bunch, and we=01,ll hopefully cut them off if=
 you=20
can get the next price and the next market at 80 or 91.

Enron:  Ryan:  Okay.  All right.  Well, I=01,ll see what I can do.

ISO:  Allen:  I appreciate it.  It=01,s actually in the best interest for t=
he=20
State and the ISO [with] what these guys are doing, so we are trying to put=
 a=20
stop to it.

Enron:  Ryan: Okay.

ISO:  Allen.  Thanks, bye.

ISO:  Allen:  I know, but if you continue to bid in at, um, the market, tha=
