Along with the TW order setting a hearing, the FERC has also imposed new 
reporting requirements for deliveries starting August 1.  The questions ask 
TW to provide daily nominated, scheduled and delivered at Cal. border 
points.  I think this data will lead FERC to further ask about why the 
scheduled number is so often below the nominated and I want to be prepared to 
explain the window process.  With Jeff Fawcett and Julia White both gone, I 
guess I draw the lucky straw of explaining this.

Any info that you can forward in the next week or two would be appreciated.

Do you have any materials that describe SoCal's current windowing procedure?
