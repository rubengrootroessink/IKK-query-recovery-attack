Leslie, if it's at all possible for you to assist by coordinating with Mike 
Day and his office, that would be immensely helpful.  If not, no worries.  
Just let me know.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff/Jim-

I assume Jeff is handling the response to the ORA/TURN filing to alter the 
PG&E tariffs on gas diversions.  Let me know if you need anything from me on 
that or anything else.  Thanks.
