Agreed.  Also, Margaret, do we have numbers on what portion of GDP and 
California's "GDP" the tech sector represents? 

Best,
Jeff

I think it will be extra important to add "lost demand" from brownouts and 
blackouts to consumption to get the real growth rate of power demand this 
year.  There was an increment of this for 1999 given the problems in New York 
City and Chicago and maybe elsewhere.

Thank you very much for the tech data.  Margaret, is there data out there 
regarding the California utilities performance (i.e., how many rolling 
blackouts, etc. v. national average)?  Thanks again.
