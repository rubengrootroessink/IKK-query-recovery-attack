		 Subject: BANKRUPTCY MESSAGING on Negative CTC

Jeff, Sue & Harry --

Michael and I are both in SF on Monday evening.  We were talking about 
getting together some time in the evening to put together a framework of our 
case around the Negative CTC in "bankruptcy" terms.

Does everyone agree and does the time work?

Jim
