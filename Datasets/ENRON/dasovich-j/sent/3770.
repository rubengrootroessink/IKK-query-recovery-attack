On 2/14, the Southern California Generator Coalition filed a petmod asking 
that the Commission amend winter balancing rules to allow customers to bring 
more gas into the system than the 10% imbalance rules permit and that 
customers be allowed to use the previous month's accumulated positive 
imbalance in lieu of flowing supplies.
 
The generator members of WPTF with facilities in southern California may be 
interested in knowing that TURN's 3/15 comments recommend instead that the 
Commission should rebundle the costs of storage for electric generators in 
their transportation rates and requires SoCalGas to store gas on behalf of 
those customers.
 
Let me know if you want to see the TURN comments.
 
Dan
