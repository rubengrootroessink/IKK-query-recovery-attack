OK, I'm a mindless idiot.  And an embarrassed one at that.  To which offer 
are you referring?  

Also, learned that PG&E's big "want" in the Son of Gas Accord is a few 
hundred million to build more Tx and Local Tx.  Sounds like this could have 
an IMMENSE negative impact on TW.  You better get your fanny out here, like 
pronto.  I sense death and destruction.
