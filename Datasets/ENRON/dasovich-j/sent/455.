Hi:  O lord.  You know, the pace at school is so much nicer--actually have 
time to think about things and absorb it.  But work has gotten so insane that 
I sympathize with your plight (since mine's the same).  I think I've maybe 
made it to 1/2--that's 1/2--of the finance classes.  

NORTH of Sacramento.  Are you driving to Sacramento every day?  Say it ain't 
so.  That's brutal.  

When you say full time, you mean school full time?  That, I assume, means 
leaving your job?  Be happy to talk about it.  You know me---believer in 
always keeping all options open and active.  If full time makes sense, you 
ought to do it.

Unfortunately, though, it looks like I'll be missing class (again) on Tuesday 
because I have to be in Portland.  If you're not going to Sac on Monday, 
coffee in SF during work hours works.  Or I could meet you during break on 
Monday.  Or we could have lunch or a beer after work on Thursday or Friday 
when I'm back from Portland.

Hang in there.  I was worried about you--seemed liked you'd gone underground 
again.  Remember, life's too short to get too worried about it.  Let me know 
what works for you.

Best,
Jeff

PS  I'm spending my Saturday nite working on a financial reporting case.  
Hope that's modest consolation.

"Strategizing?!"   (I don't think so.)

Boy did I flake on the happy hour.  Jeff-I think I've
gone over THE edge.  Hectic does't even work anymore. 
 I'm on a (fairly)good project at HP..IN SACRAMENTO,
in fact 20 miles north of Sacramento. I LOVE the
company, the learning, the work, the teams, the
people, the career opportunities.  I hate the 4+ hours
of driving on Mondays and Tuesdays, strategizing(real
word?) about balancing the needs of the team with
getting my ass to school. I really want to talk to
you...I'm thinking about full time and want your
thoughts.  Are you available at break on Tuesday for a
beer?  
Courtney
