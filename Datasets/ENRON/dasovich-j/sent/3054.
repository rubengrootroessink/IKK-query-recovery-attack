Sorry.  I figured Sandi would have included it.  Why would I have figured 
that?

Hi, Sandi.  Per your request, I talked to Jeff yesterday early evening.
I had been in a meeting with Keeley, Wright, et al after the hearing.
Jeff's proposal was not entirely clear to me, but it seemed to focus on
specifying an end date for the rate freeze in the Hertzberg bill.  I
noted that the focus of the Friday hearing and the subsequent meeting
was on how much of the short fall the utilities should be able to
recover and agreed that we would probably go from one freeze to
another.  Therefore the date of the end of the original freeze is
rapidly becoming irrelevant unless it is used to create a back way into
the first issue.  This does not seem very likely right now.  Who knows
how this will evolve, of course, but there is a sense of urgency, at
least in the Assembly.

Take care, Barbara
