See attached.  Just a couple of typos corrected in strike-out-underline.  
Question:  Thought I'd included the gain on sale as "unusual" as opposed to 
"extraordinary."  If we leave it out, are we assuming it's already included 
in the $9.5MM?  If so, we might want to include a note at the bottom of the 
spreadsheet like, $9.5 MM figure includes $750,000 gain on sale of certain 
assets completed in 1995."  Or am I just totally out lunch on this one. 

Thanks.  This one was a little messy.  You did a great job of pulling it 
together.

Best,
Jeff
