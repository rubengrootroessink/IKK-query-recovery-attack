As you can see from below, I don't see how we can support the PE Advice 
Letter.  We reserved our right to oppose it in the stip.  I think we should 
clarify that SCE will acknowledge our full claim ($124 million) without any 
offset in exchange for our cooperation with the MOU.

Attached is our record of credit balances for Enron DA accounts, as of
April 20.  The $84 million or so I referenced this morning is our
calculation of what SCE owed through 1/18.  If the PE credit methodology is
approved and applied back to January 19, then Enron would be rebilled for
$68 million (for transmission and distribution charges), which offset
against the earlier credit and the credit calculated for 1/19 - 4/20,
reduces the total credit owed to $62 million.

As we discussed, Jenny is more familiar than I with the details of the
credits and will call you back with someone from our Billing/Credit group
who is even more familiar.
