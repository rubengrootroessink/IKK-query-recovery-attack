Ken:

Could you please write a very brief synopsis of what took place on the IEP PR 
call?  Thanks very much.

Best,
Jeff

Paul:  While we've got coverage of the IEPA working group and the Direct 
Access Coaltion, I think it would be useful to have coverage of both groups 
PR activities.  I'm not sure if our SF/SaCTO people are already covering 
this, but if not, maybe Ken can spend some time monitoring their plans etc. 

Today's public affairs call for IEPA is at 1:00 pm PST.  

1800-486-2460
passcode: 120895

I keep hearing about a Direct Access press conference but have yet to hear 
details.  Any updates would be useful, and daily/weekly reports on both of 
these groups would be terrific!
