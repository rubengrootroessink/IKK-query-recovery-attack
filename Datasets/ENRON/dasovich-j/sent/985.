As uncomfortable as it sometimes is, I feel compelled to comment on what in 
my humble opinion are quite troubling statements, particularly when those 
statements come from the mouths of self-described liberal, open minded, 
diversity-loving hipsters.  I have a very hard time with stereotyping of any 
sort, and a very, very hard time when it comes from people I'm close to.  
Believe it or not, in the past, I would have been much more aggressive about 
it.  Guess I've mellowed.  Sorry if it made things, well, fidgety.  (I've 
come to grips with the fact that deep down, I tend to trend toward socially 
libertarian and sometimes even anarchist views---oh well.)

Best,
Jeff

Dude,

Thanks for the abalone last night. Too bad we had to wash it down with that 
discussion. Actually, wasn't so bad, really -- just a bit frusterating. 
Anyway, let me know what I can do for Prentice's birthday. Do you want me to 
go out there and check it out? Let me know about deposits and stuff like 
that as well.

I'm sitting here in the new place in the 'Loin listening to that great 
Mingus disk you got me. It's really amazing, a perfect compliment to sorting 
out and organizing all my papers.

Hope you're having a good day.

Scott
