I understand that there may be a need to give no quarter on this, but given 
the circumstances--i.e., we talk every day and time and resources are 
extremely tight--is it reasonable to temporarily suspend filling this thing 
out for the next 60-90 days?  Lemme know.  

My sister just called and said that the earthquake in Seattle was 7.0.  
That's big.

Best,
Jeff

Subject: New IRTF Format:  ENA Government Affairs Report - Feb 01

Attached to this e:mail, you will find the ENA Government Affairs report for 
the month of January.  This will be the new monthly format that will take 
place of the IRTF.  As you will see from the style of this format, it should 
help in expediting the process of this report.

If you have any questions,

Subject: ENA Goverment Affairs Report - Feb 01

Attached please find the ENA Government Affairs report for Feb '01.  I tried 
to incorporate the material from the IRTF reports.

I have asked Eric Benson to help me put these together going forward so 
hopefully they will be out the first week of the month.  

My other request is to see if people can modify their IRTF to include some 
new data - WHAT ACTIONS WILL OCCUR IN NEXT 30 DAYS THAT NEED ATTENTION OF 
MANAGEMENT.  This report is too  backward looking in its current form.  I 
want to try and make this a listing of what is going to happen over the next 
30 days to begin to get ENA management thinking about the issues.

Thanks,

Jim
