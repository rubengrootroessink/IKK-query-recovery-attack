Well, he launched today.  Have you seen the materials from the press 
conference that he launched today?  I think this is actually a good 
thing--makes our proposal look like a much more preferable alternative by 
comparison, makes our support in the process more important, and sets Harvey 
up as the Ralph Nader equivalent in the election to fix California's broken 
system---a potential spoiler.
