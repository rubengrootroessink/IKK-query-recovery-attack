I saw "the event" re-reun on local cable access TV (randomly viewed on 
Saturday).  It was not pretty and Jeanne did a great job of remaining calm 
and exceedlingly professional---and what a camera presence!  Unfortunately, I 
wasn't thoughtful enough to send flowers, but a large bouquet is certainly in 
order.

Best,
Jeff

Jean received a lovely bouquet of flower Friday.  She thinks it came from one 
of us, but I think it must have come from her boyfriend.  Were any of us 
being very thoughtful on Friday?
