I have ab appointment at 4:00, so I would have to do it from the car and I 
would not have nmuch time -- any time until 1:30 pm is better.

I'd like to set up a call for this afternoon to discuss the FERC's order, in 
general.  Also, in an hour or so I'll also be forwarding a proposed issue 
list on rehearing so we can talk about it.

available at 2:30pm Central/3:30pm Eastern

availability at 3:30pm Eastern
Jeff indicated is he available at 12:30 Pacific.
I left a message w/Sue asking if she can make it at 12:30pm.

Maureen advised that Steve might be able to make it at 3:30pm Eastern, so I 
will make sure she has all the info so that she can page him.

I left a message for Richard to call me back
