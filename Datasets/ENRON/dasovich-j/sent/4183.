Dorothy:
Thanks very much for the meeting yesterday.  From my perspective it was ver=
y=20
useful.

Per yesterday's conversation.  More (much) to follow (soon).  This is what =
we=20
gave the Govenor, Hertzberg, Burton, Brulte, etc., about 2 months ago (i.e.=
,=20
prior to Davis' 20-20 announcement, etc.)

You know how to get a hold of me.

Best,
Jeff

Proposal to Alleviate California=01,s Electricity Shortage
Through Incentives to Reduce Demand

Objective
=06=15 Provide consumers with financial incentives to reduce demand in=20
anticipation of Summer 2001 electricity demand

Proposal
=06=15 The California PUC should require the utilities to immediately condu=
ct=20
on-line auctions for demand reductions totaling at least 2,000 MWs
=06=15 Alternatively, DWR could run the auction and implement the buy-down=
=20
program.  However, if it is determined that DWR requires additional authori=
ty=20
to execute the auction, the State should avoid any further delays and direc=
t=20
the CPUC to order the utilities to implement the buy-down program immediate=
ly.

The Auction Process (assuming the utilities implement the program)
=06=15 Businesses and large consumers willing to commit to sustained reduct=
ions=20
through November 1, 2001 would submit bids indicating the price they would =
be=20
willing to receive for a given quantity of permanent reduction=20
=06=15 If the =01&supply=018 of available reductions offered in the auction=
 exceeds=20
2,000 MWs, the utility should accept them, or explain to the Commission why=
=20
they chose not to accept them=20
=06=15 Businesses should be permitted to include in their bids the continue=
d=20
payment of wages to compensate employees for hours of employment foregone d=
ue=20
to demand reductions

A Single Price Approach
=06=15 A single price approach to a demand buy down program has two key=20
disadvantages:
=06=15 First, customers who would be willing to reduce demand for a lesser =
price=20
will be overpaid, much in the same way the single price auction in the PC=
=20
overpaid lower cost generators.  The state would overpay for reduced demand=
=20
under the single price approach.
=06=15 Second, the single price may not attract sufficient demand reduction=
s.
=06=15 Further, the single price approach does not provide greater certaint=
y=20
regarding the cost of demand reductions.  By conducting an auction the stat=
e=20
will be able to observe all bids and pay on an as bid basis, starting with=
=20
the lowest bids necessary to provide the required demand reductions up to t=
he=20
cost the state is willing to pay.
=06=15 A single price approach, however, could work if targeted at customer=
s who=20
would not participate in an auction, i.e. residential customers.  A well=20
publicized program of rebates to residential customers who use less than la=
st=20
year would further reduce demand in the state.  Thus the auction and the=20
single price could be structured in a complimentary fashion.
=06=15 The costs of the incentive program should be paid for by all consume=
rs,=20
since all consumers will benefit from the decreased risk of service=20
interruptions caused by the demand reductions
=06=15 If DWR implements the program, DWR=01, would recover its costs throu=
gh rates,=20
similar to the cost recovery mechanism used to recover power purchase costs=
.
=06=15 If the utilities implement the program, the California PUC would inc=
lude=20
program costs in rates collected from customers
=06=15 The auction should be conducted online which will increase transpare=
ncy and=20
reduce the time required to complete the process

Hazards to Avoid
=06=15 Avoid allowing lengthy utility and/or PUC review to delay implementa=
tion of=20
the reductions
_ Any unnecessary delay increases the chance that California will fail to=
=20
achieve the reductions needed to help avoid severe shortages in Summer 2001
_ There are numerous firms offering moderately-priced on-line auction=20
services that can quickly provide auction services to the utility
_ The utility should immediately contract for on-line services and present=
=20
the contract to the California PUC for prompt approval
_ The utilities should also include in their submittal to the PUC a simple,=
=20
streamlined set of pre-qualification criteria that would apply to bidders
_ The pre-qualification criteria should be designed with the goal of making=
=20
participation as easy and expansive as possible
_ Pre-qualification will encourage legitimate offers and reduce transaction=
=20
time
_ Once the PUC has approved the auction process, the PUC should not apply a=
ny=20
additional review to the auction results
_ Auction =01&pre-approval=018 will ensure that the utilities are actively =
and=20
constructively engaged

Actions
=06=15 Governor=01,s office directs PUC to initiate auction and residential=
 program
=06=15 CPUC directs utility to submit auction proposal within 30 days
_ Establish abbreviated schedule
_ Provide parties with abbreviated opportunity to comment
_ Finalize decision approving auction proposal within 15 days of utility=20
submission
=06=15 CPUC rules in advance that results of auction are prudent, and utili=
ties=20
conduct auction by May 1
