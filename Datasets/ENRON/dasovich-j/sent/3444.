Thanks.  My guess is that someone ought to go and represent TW.  Fawcett and 
Harris ought to make that call.  Jeff D:  I assume you know who Lad Lorenz 
is.  Either Jeff:  does Lad's involvement signal anything to us--i.e., is he 
their "get stuff done guy" or their "try to look like you are getting stuff 
done guy" ?  DF
