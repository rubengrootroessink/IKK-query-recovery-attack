Mary Beth:  

For what it's worth, I've read this, and if Laura Tyson or Larry Summers sign 
it, I have serious concerns about the effect it would have on their ability 
to play the role that we envision in moving our proposal forward 
(understanding that our odds of success are somewhat meager).  While I don't 
disagree with the language, it is strong and therefore very likely to make 
the Governor and his staff very uncomfortable.  I would recommend that they 
do not sign.

Best,
Jeff

TO:?? Colleagues

SUBJECT:? Final Version

I've done my best to include your very helpful comments.? The document now 
also contains a summary.

I would like your endorsement, by noon PST (Wednesday) if possible.? A number 
of you have already indicated you would sign it.? Also, Tom Campbell has 
indicated he will try to recruit Ken Arrow.? I believe one of you agreed to 
recruit Dan McFadden.? Laura is working on Larry Summers.? Solow would be a 
great addition, too.

Can we agree on the following division of labor from here out:

1.? Recruiting others:? All

2.? Media representatives:? Campbell, Tyson, Spiller, Verlerger, Wilk, 
Teece, and Hogan (This is by no means meant to preclude anyone contacting 
the media after we go public.)

??? On media, we are giving the LA Times a 24-hour exclusive.? We won't 
release to other media sources until 9:00 AM Thursday.

Many thanks for your involvement and endorsements.
