Thanks, Dennis.  If  we could get a copy of the analyst's report, it would be 
very helpful.

Best,
Jeff

We are a retainer client of PIRA.   We have access to their monthly reports 
as well as information available on their website.

Dennis,
I forwarded Jeff the Friday Platt's Electric Power Daily.

The quotes are coming from Allan Stewart of the Pira Energy Group.  Do you 
know if we have this group on contract/retainer so that we could see the 
predictions they're making?

Please let Jeff and me know.
Jeff, if we don't have access, you probably have better contacts out there.

/Tamara

do you have access to the actual report issued by PIRA, to which the article 
refers?
