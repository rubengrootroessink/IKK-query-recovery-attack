you are just in the nick of time!  Orders have to be in by noon on Wednesday 
for Thursday delivery.  We are going to have some nummy lobsters, but I 
didn't order you one because I figured you were as sick of those as you are 
foie gras.

Prentice get in touch?  We're coming on Saturday---i'll likely bet there 
around 4 or 5.  I'll bring the money then.  In the meantime, can I order a 
case of coast zin and one of cab for pick up and payment this weekend, too?

The white wine in $4.31 per bottle including tax so you owe me $103.44. 

Shall I order lobsters for the two of you for Saturday night.  I hope you 
will join us and Jeff you can leave and study any time except for the 
actual dinner period.
