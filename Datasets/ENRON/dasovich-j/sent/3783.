Professor Tasker:

I have the distinct (and sinking) feeling that you may not be getting emails 
that I've sent to you, since over the last 3 weeks I've sent a few and 
haven't heard back.  Is the haas account the correct address?

Best,
Jeff

Greetings Professor:

Our group consists of Jeff Dasovich, Mark Guinney, Anil Sama and Carolyn
Vavrek.

We propose to examine the recently failed acquisition by Coke of Quaker
Oats:  Why merge?  What was the value?  Upside?  Downside?  Why did it go
bust?  Should it have gone through?  What's up with this Buffet guy,
anyway?

If you have any concerns with this proposal, please let us know.

Finally, if possible, we'd like to present on Thursday, April 26th.

Best,
Jeff
