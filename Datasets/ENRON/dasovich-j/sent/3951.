Join PIBA's EHS Product Strategies Committee meeting, 8:30am-10:30am
Thursday morning, April 5, 2001, at Agilent Technologies, 395 Page Mill
Road, Palo Alto - directions at <http://www.piba.org>  Registration
7:50am-8:25am.

Speakers:  Michael Cox, Agilent Technologies; Elizabeth Zimmermann, IBM;
Chris Hazen, ERM; and David Monzma of BSR

Since Agenda 21 pronounced the need for supply chain management in
Chapter 4, organizations have labored to bring their suppliers to heel
in terms of environmental risk and management.  Now, we are turning the
corner to second-generation SM tools.  Agilent=01,s best-in-class program
is a good example of these tools, leveraging other supplier
qualification considerations and ease of management for the customer.

 Join PIBA for an exciting discussion concerning managing EHS in the
supply chain.  This is an area of interest to any company that depends
primarily on suppliers for products and operations.  Michael Cox, who
manages the supply-chain EHS management program for Agilent
Technologies, will lead a participatory discussion concerning
supply-chain EHS practices and benefits.  Michael believes that this is
an area of growth opportunity for EHS professionals.  =01&The supply chain
brings together a huge number of EHS issues and opportunities under one
roof.  Integrating EHS into the chain should be a top priority for any
Fortune 500 company.=018  Michael will discuss what Agilent is doing to
take an integrated approach to this issue and to find hidden value and
opportunity.  Although the perspective will be electronics
manufacturing, any company that uses suppliers will benefit from the
discussion.

 This will be a fast paced and exciting morning.  A 30-minute discussion

will follow the presentations.  So that each speaker has use of allotted

presentation time this meeting will start on time.
