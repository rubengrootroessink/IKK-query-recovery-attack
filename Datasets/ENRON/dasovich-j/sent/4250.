April 23, 2001 SCAQMD OKs $1.7M to Buy, Install Capstone MicroTurbines 
WOODLAND HILLS, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)
The Governing Board of California's South Coast Air Quality Management 
District today approved $1.74 million to purchase 30- and 60-kilowatt 
microturbines and installation services from Capstone California, a wholly 
owned subsidiary of Chatsworth-based Capstone Turbine Corp.

The SCAQMD notes in an agenda item document on its Web site that it intends 
to ``distribute the installation of 30 kW and 60 kW MicroTurbines over the 
counties of Orange, Riverside, and San Bernardino. (SCAQMD) staff is in the 
process of identifying landfills that have waste gases that are not presently 
utilized, as well as schools, colleges, hospitals, and other suitable 
recipients that may be able to utilize these turbines for power generation... 
The proposed MicroTurbine project will produce clean power at various 
locations, using natural gas or landfill gas, and thus help mitigate the 
energy crisis to the extent feasible. Landfill gas utilization is a net 
environmental benefit since this energy may be currently wasted. The Capstone 
MicroTurbines will produce power with emissions typically lower than that of 
the average power generation mix in California, and with much lower emissions 
than stand-by diesel generators.''

In discussing microturbine technology, the document states, ``While several 
manufacturers have been developing MicroTurbine technology over the last few 
years, Capstone MicroTurbines are commercially available today in 30 kW and 
60 kW sizes, with reported NOx emissions below 9 ppm (at 15% O2) which 
represents very low emissions for this type of equipment. Capstone 
MicroTurbines are manufactured in Southern California and ... have been 
extensively tested at University of California, Irvine and found to be 
reliable and durable. At this time, they represent one of the cleanest and 
most readily available options for distributed power generation from 
MicroTurbines to mitigate the energy crisis in Southern California.''

One month ago, Capstone California announced a $4-million purchase of 
30-kilowatt Capstone MicroTurbines by the Los Angeles Department of Water and 
Power (www.ladwp.com). The purchase was part of an unprecedented cooperative 
agreement between the SCAQMD and the LADWP.
