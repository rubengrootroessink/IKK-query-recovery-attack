Mark:  Did you have wind of Jason's story on Edison calling for an end to AB 
1890?  His spin on the story was good one---Edison got everything it wanted 
(out of 1890) and now it wants out of the contract.

The story seems worthy of a response, particularly since Jason's the 
reporter.  Even the Chair of FERC recognizes that going backwards is not the 
answer.

Best,
Jeff
