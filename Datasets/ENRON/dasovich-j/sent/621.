Good points.  Paul's traveling.  I think it would be a good idea to re-group 
on the QF issues in California because the terrain has changed considerably 
in CA.

Jeff & Paul --

Let's make sure that we know how this information is being used by the 
commercial people.  I'm always worried about sending out % estimates of 
future regulatory outcomes because these opinions frequently become "fact".

Here's the memo on PX-based pricing for QFs that we discussed.  If you have 
any questions, don't hestitate to get in touch.
