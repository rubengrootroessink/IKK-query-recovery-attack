Thanks so much for responding.  This is very strange.  I have no idea what'=
s=20
gone wrong.  I'm attaching the emails that I sent.  Please let me know if y=
ou=20
receive this.  And no need to apologize; appears to be a technical glitch=
=20
somewhere. =20

The most important note (and my reason for concern when I didn't hear back)=
,=20
was the one explaining that I had to miss the second quiz due to biz travel=
=20
and offering alternatives for your consideration.  Finally, are you=20
comfortable with our proposed project?

Best,
Jeff

Greetings Professor:

Our group consists of Jeff Dasovich, Mark Guinney, Anil Sama and Carolyn=20
Vavrek.

We propose to examine the recently failed acquisition by Coke of Quaker=20
Oats:  Why merge?  What was the value?  Upside?  Downside?  Why did it go=
=20
bust?  Should it have gone through?  What's up with this Buffet guy, anyway=
? =20

If you have any concerns with this proposal, please let us know. =20

Finally, if possible, we'd like to present on Thursday, April 26th.

Best,
Jeff

Greetings.  Apologies for cluttering your email, but I've been having email=
=20
problems and wanted to ensure that you received the original note.

Best,
Jeff

=09=09 Subject: This Week's Class

Professor Tasker:

My name is Jeff Dasovich and I=01,m an evening student in your Financial=20
Statement Analysis course.  My apologies, but my work schedule has been=20
particularly unfriendly to my school schedule this semester.  As such, I=01=
,m=20
forced to throw myself at the mercy of the professor.

As you know, my schedule forced me to miss the first quiz.  I found out on=
=20
Friday that my work schedule will now force me to miss the second quiz. =20
(Much to my chagrin, I=01,ll also be missing material that you=01,ll be dis=
cussing=20
on Thursday in which I have a particular interest=01*more about the model a=
nd=20
how to value a firm in distress.  I will have the class recorded in my=20
absence, however, so it won=01,t be a not a total loss.)

I=01,m willing to 1) take the quiz another day, though I know you would rat=
her=20
not do that for all of the obvious reasons, 2) do additional assignments to=
=20
make up for missing another quiz, 3) have the other assignments in the cour=
se=20
count that much more still in determining my grade, and/or 4) any other=20
remedies you might want to pursue. =20

If you=01,d like to discuss the situation further by phone, just let me kno=
w. =20
My work number is 415.782.7822 and my home phone is 415.621.8317.

And again, my apologies for the complications and thanks for your=20
consideration.

Best,
Jeff
