Mike:

I am sorry to hear that you will be unable to meet next week, but definitely 
understand.  Actually, it looks like my colleague Jeff Dasovich would not 
have been able to make it either.  I would still like to meet with Peter if 
that is convenient for him.  I will follow up with a call to him directly.  

I hope we can try to arrange another meeting soon.

Thanks, 

Jennifer
