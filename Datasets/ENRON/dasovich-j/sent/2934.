I really apologize, but is there any way you could talk to Keith?

Jeff:  I work in the International PR group in Houston, where I'm responsible 
for South America.  As you might imagine, the California crisis is receiving 
substantial media coverage in the region.  In particular, it's being used by 
opponents of deregulation to bolster their position.  My colleagues also say 
that it's receiving the same play in India and elsewhere.  In order to shed 
more light than heat on the subject and "arm" our people in Brazil with some 
useful information on the issue, I'm attempting to put together some key 
messages and Q&As.  One obvious question is:  What are Enron's business 
dealings with California?  Both Rob Bradley and Miyung Buster mentioned you 
as the "expert", so I'm hoping you could provide with the answer to the above 
question.  Regards, Keith
