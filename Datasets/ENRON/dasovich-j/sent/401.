Jeff --

Currently, having signed the confidentiality agreement in Phase II of the
GRC, I am receiving, about every two weeks, a CD with an updated ,
confidential version of their integrated rate model. I now have a collection
of about 20 of theses things.  The decision was made last February to have
me (as opposed to anyone at Enron) sign the confidentiality agreement and
receive the model while we decided what we were going to do in the
proceeding.  Now that we decided that we are not going to do anything, I was
considering contacting the appropriate PG&E attorney and getting my name
removed from the list to receive model updates and returning the ones I have
gotten to date. I wanted to make sure this was okay with you before I
proceeded.
