don't know.  check out the website, which is where registration is.  there's 
lots on B2B, e.g., biz models/technologies.  i registered.  if i win the 
lottery you can likely persuade me to give you my ticket, or i can try to get 
one from someone who wins but can't go, or hopefully you can register and win 
one for yourself.  check out the site.
