Hey Sweetie:
So glad to hear that you're well.  Was wondering how you were weathering the 
tech melt down.  I'm good.  Trying to figure out how to plant 10 acres of 
grapes on my land in Mendocino (rather have 10 acres of grapes than a place 
in S.F., I've decided---what do you think?).  I was thinking of taking a pass 
on "sunner" school and just going all 6 semesters.  Am I stupid?  Summer 
vacation just sounds so good these days.  Leaving Monday for Mexico.  Back 
Sunday.  When you leaving?  Definitely miss seeing you.   Looking forward to 
catching up---hopefully soon.  You take care.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff-
Haven't talked to you in a while...thanks very much
for the vm you left a couple of weeks ago-very nice to
hear!  How are you?  

Things are much better for me.  Over the newbie hump
at Sun.  Goood things happening in general.  Usual
fustrations. School is fine-'cept I have to take
dreaded sunner school.  
Miss seeing you-how long will you be in Mexico?
C
