As he said in the note, we can wait on the tile.  We'll contact our pal 
karen, the tiling queen, and report back.  sound reasonable?

I gave dad a check this morning for $700 to get this underway.  What about 
the tile?

 Agree with PP's assessment also.  I don't always agree with PP's 
assessment.

Wow.  This guy sounds impressive!  I agree with Prentice's assessment (of 
course, I always agree with Prentice's assessment). 
Best, 
Jeff 
Happy Valentine's Day to all.

This guy sounds like he knows what he's talking about.  I suggest we get 
the repairs done immediately and leave the tile for later.  Can you find 
out if he can finish before next weekend whatever needs to be done to have 
a fire safely?  I've been planning a trip with two friends of mine from 
school for a long time and it would really be a bummer to have to cancel 
it.  Thanks for working on this. 
Also, about the $$, mom should have put aside $10,000 from grandpa ($5,000 
from me and Cameron each) that was supposed to go for replacing the 
roof.  This is much more important, so I suggest using that money. 
Finally, we can get Jeff's friend Karen to help us with the tiles.  We will 
talk to her.
