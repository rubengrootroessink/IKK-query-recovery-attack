Just talked to Sue re: yesterday's meeting and before I shoot myself in the 
head, I just wanted to say it's been great working with  you guys.  
Unbelievable....   In any case, congratulations.  Sounds like, all in all, it 
was a good meeting.


Scott:  has Oregon figured out who they voted for yet?
