Pls forgive my mistake - Commissioner Wood made the negative comments about
direct access., NOT Commissioner Brown.

> The PUC hosted a conference call today to discuss the agenda for

> 
> At the request of Assemblyman Hertzberg, the PUC has decided to hold the
> DA agenda item until their continuation meeting on Tuesday, July 3.
> President Lynch said the commission is holding this issue to the "limit of
> their ability." The July 3 hearing date is exactly 30 days prior to the
> date when bond contract negotiations will begin in earnest.
> 
> Commissioner Brown explained that it is "clearly necessary" for the PUC to
> end new enrollments to direct access to ensure a suitable financial
> environment for bond sales. 
> 
> "We need to secure rates as well as ensure that we have customers to pay
> those rates."
> 
> He went on to say that DA was initially a side issue in the deregulation
> process and that it never really became a reality for small customers.
> Even large customers were inconvenienced when problems with the CTC
> complicated matters even further.
> 
> Brown returned to the standard argument that if DA continues, businesses
> will be tempted to bail out on their obligation to help the state pay for
> all the forward contracts it has secured on their behalf.
> 
> "Direct access is about avoiding regulatory decisions for paying the costs
> incurred during this crisis."
