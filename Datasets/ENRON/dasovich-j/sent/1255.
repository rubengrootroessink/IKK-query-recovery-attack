Ok.  Here they are.  On exhibit A, I didn't touch numbers are exhibit #s.  
Also, I deleted CAPM, since we ain't got anything yet.  And I deleted the 
part that said "ticket sales taxes don't matter much," because now that we 
have the numbers they could matter, cuz it's really tight between bond 
payments and tax revs.  Anyway, that's it.  I checked and doubled checked the 
numbers and exihibit #s in the exec sum, but you may want to give one last 
peek.  Thanks SO much for pulling it together.

Best,
Jeff
