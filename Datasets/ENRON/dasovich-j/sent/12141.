While Leslie was out I had a brief discussion with Tycholiz, et al.  They're 
going to pull together an outline of the things they're thinking about and 
get back to us on it for discussion.

Best,
Jeff

Leslie--I don't know whatever happened to this discussion?  I suggested to 
Jeff that I would be available off and on during the week, but I think he was 
nuts with the legislative session.  SHould we try again or have you already 
discussed?

I am really only available Monday am (I am on a well-deserved vacation next 
week), but if that works for you, that would be great.  Jeff is pretty full 
up with the CA legislature and all the electric stuff.  We can try him, tho.  
What I would like is to come up with a coherent message on hedging in CA, 
particularly the core-non-core issues, so that at the end of the day, EES 
still has a market and ENA can sell hedges to the LDCs.  Sue Landwehr in Gov 
Affairs is the leader/coordinator of our hedging activities before the state 
commissions and we should get her involved as well.  In fact I will cc both 
Sue and Jeff on this.

This is to quickly summarize our call on July 11 on California gas intrastate 
matters and set a direction for future activity.

Unbundling:  PG&E has a Gas Accord in effect through 12/31/03, which is 
generally positive.  We will participate in the development of a successor 
plan, and attempt to improve it if we can.
    SoCalGas attempted its own version of a gas accord, but the CPUC refused 
to approve.  We will attempt to resurrect this accord and obtain CPUC 
approval. 

Hedging:  No proceeding currently exists to address gas hedging by LDCs.  
(draft legislation does exist on the electric side to allow hedging and 
passthrough of costs).  Jeff has recommended that we approach the LDCs to 
begin discussing the issue and developing a strategy to take to the CPUC.  I 
suggest we develop an ENA-EES hedging proposal for CA and then take that to 
the LDCs.  I will attempt to put this is writing.

Infrastructure:  CPUC has undertaken a proceeding to determine the need to 
improve infrastructure.  SoCal Gas and PG&E are responding with proposals.  
We want to revitalize the infrastructure and ensure real markets exist and 
can develop.  Our task is to participate in these proceedings.

(Please let me know who I left off the mailing list).
