		 Subject: The Answer Is:  To CLEC!

Hello Everyone,

We've gotten word back from Jim Fallon to go forward with obtaining CLEC 
licenses.  This brings us to the next set of questions:

Which entity do we license?  EBS or ETI?
If we license ETI as a CLEC, can we transfer EBS' IXC licenses to ETI?
Do we get CLEC licenses in all states, or some strategic subset of states?

I'd like to put together a group to address these questions, working with 
legal, tax, and commercial people.  Please let me know if you are interested 
in participating in this group.  It most likely will involve a fairly 
intensive schedule of meetings in Houston during December.

We should hold off on filing new IXC license applications until we have 
resolved the EBS vs. ETI issue.  For states where an EBS IXC license 
application currently is pending, let's not be too aggressive in pushing 
those applications forward over the next month.  Give me a call if this 
creates a problem in any of your states.  Also, Scott, please let everyone 
know if there are any fiber-build states where you think the delay would be a 
problem.

Feel free to give me a call if you have any questions.

Sue
