Ok - I got home at 7 - made a full dinner (chicken, mashies, arties),
watered all of your new plantings, roughed up your father in a little ping
pong, and then went on a search and destroy mission for those damn frogs.
We got 'em too!   They were two eensy little things that made the most noise
you could imagine - however they are now in "frog" heaven!

Again - I cannot thank you enough for all the help/work/beautification
projects you guys did over the weekend - what would I do without you???
