Steve:

Here's a word version of the MSA.  Sorry for the delay.  Could you make 
changes in strike-out-underline format and email back to me when you're 
done?  Thanks a million.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff,

Attached is "a" word version of the Master Purchase and Sale Agreement. 
Although it says "sample" it is identical to the version that we are 
currently using. If you have any questions, please call me on 713-853-6341.

Best regards,

Donald

the Master P&S Agreement?  Many thanks.

Regards,

Donald
