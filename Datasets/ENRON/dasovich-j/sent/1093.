Doesn't strictly qualify as an origination opportunity, but through a 
contact, I've met with some folks who have some pretty nifty network 
hardware/software that offers some interesting possibilities w/respect to 
network performance (optical routing technology).  I'd like to hook them up 
with network folks, both a technical and a commercial person.  Anyone 
suggestions?  Thanks.

Best,
Jeff
