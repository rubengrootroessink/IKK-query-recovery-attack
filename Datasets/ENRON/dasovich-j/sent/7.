FYI.  I didn't receive email yesterday, and I only started receiving them 
today at 11 AM.  Quesiton:  After Clinton's speech, don't you think the 
convention is going to cry when they have to sit through Al Gore?  I'm 
worried----he's so pathetic.

Subject: Bill's speech - and a very funny joke




I thought was pretty awesome!? My favorite was his Harry Truman quote that I 
had never heard before:? "If you want to live like a Republican, you better 
vote like a Democrat."? Scotty - maybe that's a line you can use!

Joke: 
Memory Clinic 
Two elderly couples were enjoying friendly conversation when 
one of the men asked the other, "Fred, how was the memory 
clinic you went to last month?" 

"Outstanding," Fred replied. "They taught us all the latest 
psychological techniques: visualization, association, etc. 
It was great." 

"That's great! And what was the name of the clinic?" 

Fred went blank. He thought and thought, but couldn't 
remember. Then a smile broke across his face and he asked, 
"What do you call that flower with the long stem and 
thorns?" 

"You mean a rose?" 

"Yes, that's it!" 

He turned to his wife, "Rose, what was the name of that 
memory clinic?"
