Several IEP companies have been invited to a meeting with the Governor=01,s=

The following are some options, which the Governor=01,s office is consideri=

IEP is doing some preliminary research on some of these topics.  IEP would=

like to arrange a teleconference call around noon on Monday, November 27th =

 To assure reliable electricity to California consumers for the lowest=20

o Consider eliminating the ISO and assigning its functions to either a stat=

o Consider sponsoring/supporting legislation to change the ISO and PX board=

o Expand energy conservation programs focused both on immediate peak demand=

o Aggressively work to site new generation and transmission facilities, to=

streamline permitting, and to develop renewable resources.
o Call for/sponsor federal FERC reform legislation that would:
o Impose a regional price cap that varies by time of day and year;
o Set requirements for FERC to use its retroactive refund authority;
o Improve FERC enforcement over price gouging practices;
o Affirm the role of states to protect their customers from unjust prices.
o Pressure the FERC to do its job to (1) bring about responsible seller=20

market interventions as necessary, and (2) provide refunds to affected=20
consumers.
