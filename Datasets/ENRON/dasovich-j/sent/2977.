P.S.  Please let Marathon know that the information they're providing is both 
greatly appreciated and highly valued and we hope that they can continue to 
poke around and fill us in on what they hear.  Great having multiple data 
points.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff -- If the lawyers can't, I'm sure we can ask Marathon to get the 
filing.  Let me know.  kd
