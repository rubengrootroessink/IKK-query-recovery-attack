Hi Cindy:

Mark asked me to give you these to fax to Mark at the Four Seasons.  Three 
things:

Berkeley Academics "Manifesto"--very confidential
My preliminary doodlings for a talk I'm giving at an EXNET conference in New 
York on Monday
A one page "backgrounder" that Jim and I put together for the Bush transition 
team.

Thanks a million.

Jeff
