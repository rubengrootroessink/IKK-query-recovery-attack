Professor Berk:

Very interesting to hear the perspectives of a South African ex-pat last 
evening. 

Today's been very hectic, but I'll get back to you on the possibility of 
having Enron sponsor internships for the financial engineering program.  
Until we've had a chance to talk, could you wait before forwarding my name 
along to anyone else in the fin eng group?  Much appreciated.

Best,
Jeff
