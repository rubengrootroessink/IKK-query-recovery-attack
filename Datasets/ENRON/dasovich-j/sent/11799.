Go ahead without the gas, unless you can get into my American Express account 
and find out what those numbers are.  Thanks a million.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff - 

FYI:  due to a change [again] in the system for Expense Reporting, *must* 
have submitted your
current Report by Wednesday, the 27th.  Otherwise, will have to start over in 
the "new" system, however that 
will be unavailable until Monday, July 2nd ...or so I understand.

Except for whatever you incurred today, I'm current with your receipts 
*except*
whatever you spent on gas with your last (6/18 - 6/21) rental car (you noted 
it but neither indicated amount(s)
nor supplied receipts!).

Thanks,

Joseph
