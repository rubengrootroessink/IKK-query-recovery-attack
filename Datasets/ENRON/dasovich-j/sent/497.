Our meetings will be much more effective you attend.  We should try to talk 
tomorrow or Friday.

I'd be happy to help/attend if you think it would help, but won't be offended 
if you want to do it on your own or w/ Brian.  Do you want to schedule a 
quick call tomorrow or friday?

I like the idea.  Particularly in view of the "California Crisis."  Makes our 
positions that much more compelling and offers at least part of the 
"solution" for California.

Jeff/Sue, what are your thoughts about trying to meet with commissioners or 
key staff to advance our quite reasonable positions in the DG case?  The 
Phase 1 ruling is only a month away.  It still baffles me that such contacts 
are permissible, but obviously the utilities are doing whatever they can to 
oppose our positions on UDC ownership, open access D tariffs, and standby 
rates.
