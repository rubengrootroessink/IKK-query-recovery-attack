Thanks so much for the info.  This is very useful.  I will try to make the 
next meeting.  Hopefully the crisis out here will be over by then.  How would 
you structure it differently next time?

Best,
Jeff

The meeting went well. There was a lot of discussion regarding the current 
deals involving the env. market.  ENA global markets presented their strategy 
on trading/marketing emissions as well as compliance outsourcing 
(comprehensive services related to emissions reductions.); EES talked about 
capturing bypassed emissions from current bundled deals as well as the 
challenges of doing retail in states w/ varying mandates & reporting 
requirements; EES (Bruce Stram) talked a bit about dg;  ENA origination 
talked about a massive fuel cell project they are working on (they are 
keeping it confidential currently); ENA West Structuring talked about 
financial packages to offset intermittent risk assc. w/ wind; Michael Payne 
EWC talked about wind development in the states and the associated 
opportunities w/ renewable energy credits; New Power talked a bit about their 
rollout in NJ, PA and upcoming CA.  New Power is at a point where they need 
to get up on the curve w/ regard to renewable mandates and reporting 
standards.

Everyone seemed to agree that it makes sense for environmental strategies to 
act as the "link" between the groups w/ regard to env. market opportunities.  
There are considerable synergies involved w/ ee, renewables, air emissions 
and technology control, and as we interface across the commercial groups, 
ensure that the left hand is talking to the right (i.e. the deals are 
capturing the most value and groups are aware of what others are working 
on.)  We are rolling out an intranet page where we intend to offer business 
intelligence and env. regulation info.  In the near term, I'll be circulating 
the presentations and the contact list.  There will be some sort of follow up 
meeting that is structured completely differently than this one.

Hope this is helpful.  Have a good weekend.
Stacey

My apologies, but as you can imagine, California's little crisis has me a bit 
preoccupied.  Would love to know what comes out of the meeting, though.

Best,
Jeff
