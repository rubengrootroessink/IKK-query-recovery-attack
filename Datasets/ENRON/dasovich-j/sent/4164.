FYI.  The agenda for the legislative oversight committee's gas hearing 
tomorrow includes two Brattle Group consultants, Paul Carpenter and Matt 
O'Loughlin. They will make up the first panel, titled, "California's High 
Natural Gas Prices: Market Power and Other Factors."

In California's gas wars, Edison hired these folks--Carpenter in particular-- 
to show that SoCalGas has considerable market power in California and abuses 
it.  (Edison was a long-time, very unhappy gas customer of SoCalGas', until 
it sold off its power plants.  The animosity remains, however.)  Should be 
interesting to see where the committe goes with that panel.

CA PUC lawyer, Harvey Morris, is the sole witness on the second panel.  
Harvey is zealous in his assertions regarding market power in interestate 
markets serving California and is the PUC's lead attorney on such matters at 
FERC.

I plan on attending the hearing.

It's likely that I will also be attending a hearing on price caps at CMA's 
offices in the afternoon.

Best,
Jeff
