Hey, forget football, and Terrell what's-his-name and the demise of the 
49ers.  Think road.  If it's going to get done 1) the wood needs to get moved 
and 2) we need to tell Jeff Green immediately so he can order the gravel.  
Let me know.  It's the 2 minute warning and you're down by a touchdown.

Best,
Jeff
