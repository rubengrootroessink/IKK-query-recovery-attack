In the Senate:
Today the Senate passed out of committee SB18XX and is expected to pass the 
bill out of the full Senate sometime today.  
The bill would de-link 1) payment for bonds issued to repay General Fund 
dollars used to buy power from 2) payment for power contracts signed by DWR.
The Senate has thus far failed to get its version of the "Edison MOU" 
(SB78XX) out the necessary committees in order to get it to the floor for a 
vote by the full Senate.  
It is unclear at this point whether the Senate will try to vote the MOU bill 
out of the Senate, or focus solely on SB18XX (de-linking bonds from DWR 
contracts) prior to leaving for vacation.
Dunn got a resolution passed that permits his investigative committee to take 
depositions of individuals.

In the Assembly:
The Assembly has thus far failed to get an "MOU" (82XX or 83XX) voted out of 
the full Assembly, though expectations are that the Hertzberg bill (82XX) 
will get voted out of the Assembly today.
