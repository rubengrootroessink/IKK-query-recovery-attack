Subject: Environmental Strategy Meeting

The Environmental Strategies group invites you to attend a company-wide, 
Enron Environmental Strategy Meeting on September 15th from 9-2 (including 
lunch & snacks).  The purpose of the meeting is to start an internal dialogue 
about the growing environmental market and ways in which Enron can capture 
associated business opportunities.  As many of you are aware, the 
environmental market is quickly changing and expanding with a growing 
correlation between energy efficiency, renewable energy, air emissions, and 
new technology developments.  Given our vast industry expertise and 
comprehensive service, Enron has a significant advantage to meet these market 
demands, which present both wholesale and retail opportunities.

For those of you that can attend, please RSVP by sending in a short 
description of what you do, and any suggestions to the below tentative agenda 
by Friday, September 8th.   I'll circulate these descriptions to those who 
have RSVPd along with a finalized agenda.   The location is TBD.  

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at 3-9916. 
Stacey Bolton
