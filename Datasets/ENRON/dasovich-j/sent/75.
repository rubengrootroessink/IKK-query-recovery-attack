Greetings All:
If memory serves, our filing in California is due on Tuesday.  Steve Bowen & 
Co. should be getting me a draft today based on our discussion a couple of 
weeks ago in Houston.  Soon as I get it, I'll be distributing for review.  
Aim would be to have it in shape COB tomorrow.  Thoughts?

P.S.  Some good news.  Recall from our meeting a couple of weeks ago that I 
mentioned that there were some preliminary filings we had to make in Arizona 
(in order to transact business there) prior to filing for a CPCN.  Well, I've 
spoken with Robin Hill, and those filings have already been made some time 
ago, so that's one less thing to worry about.

Best,
Jeff
