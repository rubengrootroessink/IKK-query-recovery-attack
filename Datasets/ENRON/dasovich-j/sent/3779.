Hey babe.  I called you last nite re: ROI model, but only got the answering

How's the face doing?  When do you leave on travel?

Hiya,

Sorry to be a pest but....
Can you get any idea from Steve's past experience whether the rest of my
friends who are on witing lists are liable to get into their workshops?
Scott Laughlin  Mandolin
Jeff Dasovitch  Guitar
Prentiss Sellars  Banjo

Thanks,

Matty
