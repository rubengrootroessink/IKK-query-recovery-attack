Hi Mark:

Good to see you in Vancouver. Here are the reports that I referred to.





And here's the URL for the conference that Littlechild and I are 
participating in.
http://gspp.berkeley.edu/events/electricity_summit_conference.htm.

Finally, do you have Littlechild's email address?

Best,
Jeff
