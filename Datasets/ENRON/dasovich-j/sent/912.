We can also meet at my meager apartment.  Parking is difficult, although,
there is one spot on the sidewalk in front of my house that the neighborhood
has deemed a legal spot.  Do you have parking Jeff?

Either is fine with me!

How lame is this e-mail...

Where are we meeting tonight?  I think I may have your case study...I have
someone's.

See you tonight,
Jackie

Jackie,

We have changed your team assignment for the Mid Program Academic
Retreat.  You were assigned to Atlantic 5, but that team had more members
than any other and we needed to reshuffle to achieve some parity.

You are now assigned to Atlantic 4.

This means that your Pre-Meeting will occur on Tuesday, and not Wednesday.

Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions or concerns that
you may have.

Thank you,

Meg St. John
Assistant Director, Evening MBA Program
(510) 527-1406
