Sorry, dude. Don't mean to overload you. But could you just tell me the best 
way to get from Geary and Larkin to a Bart station that will take me to 
Berkeley? Cameron and I are going to see Steve Earle's sister Stacey tonight 
at the Frieght. I think she asked P dub-yah if you guys wanted to come, but 
becaue there's no banjo and all that... When you get a chance to give me 
that info, I'd greatly appreciate it.

Best,

Big Oil
