Wilson says Davis ignored warnings about energy

Former Gov. Pete Wilson, who signed the controversial 1996 energy 
deregulation bill into law, blasted his successor Gray Davis yesterday for 
failing to aggressively use the governor's most forceful tool -- emergency 
powers -- to contain the state's energy crisis. 
"There are people who have ignored the supply and tried to blame the crisis 
on everyone else," the Republican former governor told nearly 100 academics 
and reporters at the Public Policy Institute in San Francisco yesterday. 
Arguing that Davis ignored early warnings about brewing problems and "put in 
jeopardy parks, schools and other capital needs," Wilson said the Democratic 
governor has skillfully engaged in finger-pointing and public relations to 
blur perception of the current energy troubles. 
"They've sought to blame me, and have done so with some success. . . . And 
they've found a much more profitable and exciting target, President Bush," 
said Wilson, who wryly pronounced Bush's recent trip to California as "a 
triumph -- for Davis." 
But Davis' strategy, he said, "doesn't create one watt of new power." 
Wilson's speech -- his toughest public remarks to date on the energy crisis 
-- came the day the Public Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, 
released polls showing Californians now believe energy ranks far and away as 
the state's most pressing problem. Many of those voters blame Wilson, not 
Davis, for the power shortages and rolling blackouts, the poll shows. 
The former governor's sharp words were rejected by Davis' senior political 
adviser, Garry South, who said Wilson is trying to "revise history." 
"If there is one shred of evidence that Pete Wilson said one thing or raised 
one red flag about energy supply, let him produce it," South said yesterday. 
"Pete Wilson accusing Gov. Davis of being responsible (for energy) is like 
Herbert Hoover blaming FDR for the Depression. We're trying to clean up his 
mess." 
The GOP former two-term governor spoke on the issue of California energy as 
members of the Bush administration fanned out across the nation, including a 
California trip by Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, to push the White 
House's energy policy. 
But even the president appeared to point the finger at Wilson for some of 
California's problems. "They hadn't built a power plant in 12 years" in 
California, Bush told reporters Wednesday. "And guess what? When you grow 
your state the way they have . . . it creates problems." 
Such words chafe Wilson, who produced California Energy Commission figures 
that, he said, showed that small plants were built during his administration. 
In fact, he argued, the 1996 deregulation bill encouraged energy producers to 
seek state approval for new plants. 
While acknowledging the 1996 bill he signed was "flawed," Wilson said, "I 
thought the flaws would be addressed." 
"We knew it was not a perfect free market mechanism," said Wilson, adding 
that he had strong reservations about the utility rate caps included in the 
legislation. "(That) was a gamble, but it was one that paid off for while." 
But, he insisted, the bill -- which critics say kicked off California's 
energy woes -- had benefits for the state. 
Wilson said it was believed deregulation would spur private industry to build 
new plants that would fuel industry and "lots of jobs for Californians." 
Deregulation was also seen as a means to balance power companies' concerns 
about a lengthy, "nightmarish" process -- which he said dated to the early 
1970s -- to build large power plants. 
Davis "is now posing in front of those plants" opening because of decisions 
made before he took office, Wilson noted. "I hope that he's pleased with our 
handiwork." 
Wilson, also lambasted Davis for failing to heed 1998 warnings from the 
California Energy Commission about coming blackouts. 
And, Wilson said, as the state faced rolling blackouts, job losses, and 
skyrocketing energy costs, Davis failed to use one of his greatest tools in a 
crisis: emergency powers. 
Wilson noted that after the 1994 Northridge earthquake, estimates suggested 
it would take 2 1/2 years to rebuild downed freeways and overpasses. He used 
his emergency powers to offer incentives to contractors that rebuilt the 
bridges within 65 days. 
South, noting that Davis has used his emergency powers to deal with the 
energy crisis, said there is no comparison between an earthquake and a full- 
blown statewide energy crisis.
