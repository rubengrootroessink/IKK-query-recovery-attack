Joseph,

Per our telephone conversation, attached is the draft program for the 
activities scheduled for our client's Grand Opening which will be attended by 
Governor Gray Davis and other Government VIP's.  As I told you, my company, 
The Bentley Company (Architecture/Engineering/Construction company within 
EES), was responsible for a prominent part of this facility's construction 
(involving the conversion of a large Boeing factory that SR Technics acquired 
with much involvement from the Governor's office) and Enron/Bentley will be 
part of the Grand Opening through possible sponsorship of some event(s), full 
page ad in the souvenir program, Enron name brand recognition through 
banners, etc.  I am working out the details of our involvement with the event 
coordinator right now.  I suspect Enron governmental affairs would like 
involvement given the relatively high exposure this event will garner 
politically and through the news media (please refer to the attachment).

Please contact me ASAP at 661-609-4886 to discuss.

Regards,

Ed Ghalib, S.E.
Director, Client Management
