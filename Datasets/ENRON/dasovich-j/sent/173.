floated idea.  people like.  but.....(hate to sound like a broken record) the 
whole ball of wax from Enron's view regarding sponsorship, streaming, etc., 
will depend on the agenda/participants).  

looking forward to the call.  i'll only have 60 minutes max, however, so 
counting on you to facilitate forcefully.
