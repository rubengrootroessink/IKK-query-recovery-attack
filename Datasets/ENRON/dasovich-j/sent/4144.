Prentice and I talked.  She's going to come back from the sports gig for the 
dinner party.  Don't worry to much about the ganged-up-on-thing---Prentice is 
cool.  She's ready to play.  She and I have been playing together (though our 
respective repertoires, as designed by Avram, diverge more than they 
converge).  We're getting pretty hot on Earl's breakdown, though.

P.S. Comes a point in one's life (like, when you're an adult), that you take 
personal responsibility for your actions---"my dad made me do it" must simply 
give way.  And "my dad made me an exquisite perfectionist" must REALLY really 
give way.

Best,
Jeff

Thanks for the nice e-mail.

I hope you can make the party. Cameron just told me that Prentice has some 
sports thing happening; hopefully Friday's activities aren't too pressing.

As far as the music, Cameron is going to try to shed that Nazi side of her 
that has been sort of instilled in her from her dad (or she attributes it to 
her dad and his perfectionist stance towards music). On the other hand, I am 
too sensitive to her, so we're both going to try to be very aware of both 
those things. We've talked about it and realize that we're going to have to 
get over it in order to enjoy the music. I think if she's more mellow, then 
maybe Prentice won't feel so ganged up on? I hope not, anyway.

Just give us the total for Squaw, and we'll cut you a check.

See you this week,

Scott
