I have just been advised by Commissioner McIntyre's office that he will NOT 
be traveling to Portland this week.  Subsequently (obviously) he has 
cancelled his visit to the trading floor scheduled for Oct. 13th.  

We will try and coordinate with the Commissioner's office to arrange a visit 
at a later date.

As you know, I have been working with the Commissioner's office to arrange 
for Cmmr. McIntyre 
to tour the floor when he is in Portland the 12th & 13th of October.

Just to update you:

The Commr. is unavailable the 12th.  He will be in the office the 13th at 
2:00pm
Tim Belden has indicated that he is available the 13th, and I have reserved 
Mt. St. Helens in his name at 2:00pm.
Jake Thomas is out of country and cannot attend.
Chris Calger is out of the office the 13th and cannot attend.
Paul Kaufman is out of the office and cannot attend.

Tim, if you would like my assistance in planning the visit, please let me 
know!

Cynthia - Here is a map from the hotel to the office.

From street level, Commissioner McIntyre will need to take the escalator at 
Three (3) World Trade Center up to the main entrance.

Inside the double doors is a guard desk.  He needs to sign in and get a Guest 
pass.  
They will ask him who he is here to see and he should advise Lysa Akin and 
give them my extension at 7927.

I will then come down and escort him to the floor.
