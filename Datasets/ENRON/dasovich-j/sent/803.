WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson will announce 
Wednesday a series of initiatives the Clinton administration will undertake 
to help alleviate California's power supply crisis, the U.S. Department Of 
Energy said in a press release Tuesday. 
     
Richardson will announce the initiatives at a press event in Sacramento. He 
will be joined by California Gov. Gray Davis and California congressional and 
state lawmakers. 

     The initiatives will "help California reduce the strain on its 
electricity system and increase electric grid reliability," the DOE said in 
the release. 

     The event is scheduled for 11 a.m. PST (1900 GMT) at the Sacramento 
Municipal Utility District's Hedge Photovoltaic Facility. 

     A DOE spokesman declined to provide further information Tuesday.
