Thanks, man.  Up until the trauma and the drama (the genesis of which remains 
a mystery), I had a great time.  Please thank Sarah and Bob---great food, 
great company, etc.  Tell them sorry for leaving all my stuff lying around.  
Thanks for sending a single check.  $736 is the amount.  Talk to you soon.

Best,
Jeff

Sarah has the parka. I'll let you know as soon as I get it sometime this 
week. I actually came home that night wearing Bob's jacket, and Kent went 
home clad in mine... Shows you the state of affairs. Drinking red wine like 
that really fucks me up big time. I need to switch to beer at some point... 
Unfortunately, there wasn't much of it there. I had a great time, though. 
Thanks for coming. I hope you had an okay time.

No problem about the check. I actually thought afterwards that that might be 
easier for you. Could you just tell me the amount again, and I'll put it in 
the mail today.

Good luck with school.

Cheers!

Scott
