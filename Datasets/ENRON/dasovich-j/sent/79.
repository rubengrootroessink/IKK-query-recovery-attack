Yes, please forward along.  Kathleen and Thom, Don Schultz is, and has been 
for about two decades, a rather earnest and tenacious crusader for DSM.  Very 
detail-oriented sort of fellow.  Works for the California Commission's 
"Division of Ratepayer Advocates."  Just a heads up.

Best,
Jeff

See the attached message received through www.enron.com.  I don't see 
anything in the articles I opened that reference anything to do with New 
Power Company.  Shall I forward this to Kathleen or Thom as well?

I would like to establish contact (phone and email) with a former colleague
of mine, Jeff Dasovich.  I have specific questions related to Enron/New
Power capabilities for providing total bill (gas and electricity) reduction
and rate stabilization (gas and electric) services that include the
installation of current generation of "micro-power" technologies.  The
specifics of my querie and request for additional information, are based on
the information and products/services identified in the attached documents.
