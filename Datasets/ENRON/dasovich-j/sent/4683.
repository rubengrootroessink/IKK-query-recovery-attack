Nice job.  Only comment is that the crazies in California now find market 
power under every rock and in every pipeline.  I think there's a chance that 
someone might assert that 20% share equals market power.  Might want to say 
"significant supplier" or something similar.  No big deal, but I thought I'd 
flag it for your consideration.

Best,
Jeff
