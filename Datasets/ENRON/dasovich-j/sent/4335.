10,000 creditors seek PG&E billions 
Confidential list reveals each vendor's claim

The plight of PG&E's vast array of business partners, many of which are owed 
millions of dollars, is made painfully clear in a confidential list of 
creditors now being compiled for the utility's bankruptcy proceedings. 
A copy of the list, obtained by The Chronicle, illustrates the impact of the 
third largest bankruptcy in U.S. history on PG&E's thousands of vendors. 
This also is the first time the monetary value is being revealed for each 
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. contract. 
"It's going to be a cat fight," said Cathy Moran, a Mountain View bankruptcy 
attorney. "They'll be fighting over a limited pot of money, and each party 
will be seeking preferential treatment." 
The $9 billion owed by the utility to its more than 10,000 creditors 
constitutes the largest-ever bankruptcy involving a utility. The need to keep 
California's lights on adds a virtually unprecedented level of complexity to 
the proceedings. 
Companies on the creditor list run the gamut from huge to tiny. IBM Corp. and 
Pacific Bell are joined by the likes of Pete's Auto Body Shop in Merced and 
Sponges Car Wash in San Ramon. 
"We provide gas and electricity to 13 million people," said Ron Low, a PG&E 
spokesman. "Behind all the poles and wires are thousands of employees and the 
thousands of vendors who support them." 
He said every department at the utility had spent weeks pulling together 
information for the creditor list, to be submitted to Bankruptcy Judge Dennis 
Montali by mid-May. 
'REPAY ALL OUR CREDITORS' 
"We've had to look at all the contracts we have with companies and 
individuals," Low said. "It is our intention to repay all our creditors." 
Whether the various creditors receive all, some or none of the cash owed them 
will be determined once a reorganization plan is worked out, perhaps years 
down the road. 
The Bankruptcy Court will contact all PG&E creditors and invite them to 
submit what is known as a "proof of claim" -- evidence that the creditor 
indeed is owed money. 
This is a matter taken very seriously by San Martin's Allwaste 
Transportation, a chemical disposal firm, which relies on PG&E for about a 
quarter of its total revenues. 
As it happened, an Allwaste technician was pumping hazardous waste out of 
PG&E's Humboldt Bay power plant near Eureka at the exact same time that the 
utility was filing for bankruptcy protection on April 6. 
Payment for that service, as with hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of 
other jobs, is now in limbo as a result of PG&E's bankruptcy. 
'THEY STUCK WITH US' 
"PG&E is very important to us," said Lee Soares, Allwaste's operations 
manager. "This is definitely a hit." 
He added, however, that his company would stand behind the utility. "They 
stuck with us when we went bankrupt," Soares acknowledged. 
Many of PG&E's creditors reflect the utility's core operations. For example, 
the list contains numerous affiliates involved with power poles, trimming 
trees around electricity lines or laying pipes for natural gas transmission. 
Meanwhile, other creditors speak to the nuts and bolts of running a business 
with 21,500 workers and far-reaching activities. 
If a PG&E truck is involved in a fender-bender in the East Bay, it might be 
taken to The Masters body shop in Hayward, which has a contract with the 
utility valued at $28,800. 
"We do a lot of work for them," said co-owner Jan Masters. "We'd miss the 
account if they stopped coming." 
That hasn't happened yet. Masters said PG&E had continued bringing its 
vehicles to her two-person shop since the bankruptcy filing. So far, the 
utility has paid its bills promptly. 
"They don't get the vehicle back if we don't get paid," Masters noted. 
One of the most prominent creditors on PG&E's list is Hertz Equipment Rental 
Corp. The utility's $13 million contract makes it Hertz's single biggest 
corporate client in the Bay Area and one of its largest in the nation. 
500 PAYMENTS DUE HERTZ 
According to the creditor list, PG&E has nearly 500 payments for various 
equipment and vehicle rentals outstanding with Hertz. The individual 
transactions range in value from as much as $97,539 to as little as $1. 
"We provide a lot of equipment for them, heavy construction equipment to 
build things," said Diana Kirby, who handles the PG&E account at Hertz's 
Rohnert Park headquarters. "Basically, they couldn't afford to purchase all 
the items they rent from us. 
"Their filing for bankruptcy will have a large impact on us," she added. "But 
we'll weather the storm. What else can we do?" 
That's the dilemma facing all PG&E creditors, large and small. A select 
committee of the utility's largest creditors will seek to represent other 
vendors during the bankruptcy proceedings. 
In typical Chapter 11 cases, this arrangement tends to work smoothly for all 
concerned. But in a case as sprawling and complicated as PG&E's 
reorganization, there is a possibility that the interests of smaller 
creditors can get lost in the shuffle. 
The bankruptcy judge could seek to simplify things by addressing the claims 
of PG&E's smaller creditors first, thus reducing the size of the playing 
field when the big guys begin duking it out. 
"This case is going to write its own rules," predicted Moran, the bankruptcy 
lawyer. "You've got a very large number of dollars and the public interest 
involved." 
STRANGE BEDFELLOWS
You also have a situation in which PG&E's financial demise has made 
bedfellows of companies and individuals that might otherwise have never 
crossed paths. 
Xerox Corp. now stands arm-in-arm with Hayward's A-1 Septic Tank Service. 
Enterprise Rent-A-Car is a comrade of Modesto's Jack Frost Ice Service. 
Hewlett-Packard Co. in Palo Alto has more than 40 claims outstanding for 
computer services ranging in value from $22 to $72,583. But the company 
already is looking ahead to new deals. 
"PG&E has been a good customer," said Randy Lane, an H P spokesman. "We would 
expect that, after the proceedings are done, they'll continue to be a good 
customer." 
On the other hand, freelance photographer Steve Castillo in Menlo Park has a 
contract with PG&E valued at $25,000 to shoot pictures for the utility's in- 
house newsletter. That was when times were good. 
"I assume I'm not going to get any more calls from them," Castillo said.
