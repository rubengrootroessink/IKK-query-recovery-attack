Greetings!  

Couple of things.

1) From the notes flying around, it looks like the "word-smithing" of the 
letter to the Governor continues.  We think you folks are doing exactly the 
right thing in sending a letter.  We intend to play an energetic and 
constructive role in the months ahead to help California come up with 
solutions that make competition work for everyone.  But for a variety of 
reasons I won't bore you with in this email, we're going to decline signing 
the letter.  If you'd like to discuss, feel free to give me a call at 
415.782.7822.

2) When's the next meeting, and when's the "annual retreat?"

All the best,
Jeff
