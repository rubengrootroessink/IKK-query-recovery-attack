Jeff-
I am always interested! The angle we are looking for is the natural gas
marketing side of things. Are YOU still interested? YES.  And I am getting you
because you are afraid to expose anyone else from your company to the
wildness and unpredictability of the AB 1890 Group? NO--I worried about 
exposing the staid Sacramento types to high-strung Enron people. (kidding--I 
can provide what you need on the market stuff):)

Well, if you're going to want someone from Enron, it's going to have to be
me.  Let me know if you're still interested.

Jeff-
I am putting together a panel at the AB 1890 Retreat on natural gas issues
and would like to include an Enron representative. We are trying to get
folks who are dealing with the nuts and bolts issues, someone on the
ground -- you get the idea - someone from Houston. Below are the details on
the panel:


Tuesday November 14th -- 1:30 p.m. - 3:00 p.m.
Natural Gas Issues
Issue: The future cost and availability of natural gas will become a
dominant factor in the generation of electricity in California as more
generation is built in future years. We have seen the natural gas price
increase over 100% in the last fifteen months. Why has the price increased
so dramatically? While the price increases can be expected to spur
increased
exploration and drilling, and this supply. Where can California expect to
procure its natural gas supply and at what price over the next five to ten
years? There are now some significant natural gas storage facilities coming
on line - will they help hedge future price volatility? Are independent,
unregulated generators concerned about our natural gas future? Who are the
largest competitors to California for natural gas supply and what will be
the role of new technology in increasing capture of new supply?

Moderator: Keith McCrea

Suggested Panelists:
____________, California Energy Commission (Fuels planner)
____________, El Paso Energy Corporation (Pipeline representative)
____________, Fuels Procurement, Calpine
____________, Enron
____________, Gas Storage Representative
Ed Yates, CA League of Food Processors (customer perspective)

Can you get back to me and let me know if and who could participate from
Enron? Thanks for your help.

Delaney

P.S. You better be planning to attend this year -- at least the day
sessions! :-)
