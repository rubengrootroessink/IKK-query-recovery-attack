Ralph:

Thanks.  Really looking forward to discussing further.  The proposal is very 
promising.  As you can imagine, Enron's going to have two concerns:  1) 
ensuring that eligibility for participating in the competition is as broad as 
possible (paragraph #1), and 2) ensuring that the "terms specified by the 
Commission that will ptrotect the regulated service and its other customers 
from financial harm" don't unintentionally (or otherwise) have the effect of 
killing direct access (like AB 1890 did).

Appreciate you sharing this.  You can count on Enron's support.  (Though I 
understand that Enron's support these days is not the most sought after 
commodity---I leave that up to your judgment.  We'll be prepared to help in 
away way you see fit.)

Have a nice weekend.

Jeff
