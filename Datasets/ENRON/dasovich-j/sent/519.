BEEP stack is the supply curve for real-time energy that the ISO develops on 
the basis of bids and offers.  The problem is that the plants the ISO 
ultimately dispatches from the stack often conflict with the merit order 
developed from the bids/offers, and the ISO has never been clear about the 
decision metrics it uses to determine ultimate dispatch.  Everyone, including 
Belden, thinks it can and ought to be a helluvalot more transparent.
