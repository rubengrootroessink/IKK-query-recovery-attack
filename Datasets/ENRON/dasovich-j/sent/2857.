Greetings, Kari. =20

Today's installment includes:

Background on Nord Pool
Information on the status of de-regulation in Pennsylvania.

The rumors regarding securitization of utilities' power purchase costs had =
a=20
very positive effect on the utilities' stock today.  Congratulations.  Ther=
e=20
is conflicting information floating around, though. =20

Some wires stories say that a state senator will sponsor a securitization=
=20
bill.  Others say that it will be the Governor's bill.  Is securitization=
=20
legislation something that the Governor intends to sponsor/support?=20

Though there are clearly some challenges to securitization, we think it=20
offers a promising option.

Hope the information is useful.

Best,
Jeff

In most parts of the Commonwealth, current competitive retail prices for =

residential customers are 0.90 to 3.15 cents per kilowatt-hour less than=20
what  customers were paying for the same generation and transmission servic=
e=20
prior to  competition. As a result of stranded cost charges that utilities=
=20
are being  allowed to collect, these substantial competitive savings are no=
t=20
fully passed  on to consumers.
?
In fact, were it not for stranded cost charges, Pennsylvania=01,s residenti=
al =20
customers would have had their total rates (including distribution and =20
transition rates) decline by about 20% in 2000. Generation rates would have=
 =20
declined by as much as 40%. These huge price reductions are real but will=
=20
not  fully reach customers during the transition period when utilities are=
=20
allowed to  collect stranded costs.
?
Competitive retail prices are also in most cases less than Pennsylvania=01,=
s =20
default rates or shopping credits. This is important and encouraging,=20
because  Pennsylvania=01,s current residential default rates or shopping cr=

are in  every case much less than what customers were paying for generation=

competition.
?
The California fiasco has meant a lot of discussion about the price of =20
electricity, but it has not meant a lot of understanding of sensible=20
competitive  policies=01, potential impact on retail prices. Instead, a gre=
at=20
deal of reporting  reflects understandable misconception of basic price=20
benchmarks. For example,  very few stories identify accurately or even at a=
ll=20
what customers were paying  for generation service prior to competition (th=
e=20
pre-competition embedded  generation rate of the incumbent utility). This=
=20
failing can be traced to the  fact that states have not prominently made th=
is=20
data available.
?
Worse yet, many press articles mistakenly assume the default rate or the =
=20
shopping credit is equal to what customers were paying the local utility fo=
r =20
generation service prior to competition, and report that competition will=
=20
lead  to price shock for customers if market prices exceed present default=
=20
rates. But  this dramatic warning is typically wrong.
?
The press=01, misunderstanding hides an important fact: current default  ra=
tes=20
or shopping credits are nearly always much less than what customers were =
=20
paying for generation service prior to competition. Total rates after the =
=20
transition to competition will not be greater than they were prior to =20
competition, unless competitive retail rates exceed the utility=01,s =20
pre-competition embedded generation rate.=20
?
Consequently, if competitive prices are higher than current default rates =
=20
but lower than a utility=01,s pre-competition embedded generation rate,=20
consumers  will have lower total rates once stranded cost charges are remov=

and the  transition period expires. That is, they will if a state creates a=
