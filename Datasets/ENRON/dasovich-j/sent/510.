FYI.  Rebecca got back in touch wanting to talk about the history of dereg in 
California.  Been trading messages.  When she gets back to me with what she 
wants to discuss, I'll check back in before having the conversation.  
Question:  What about giving her a copy of our high tech slides with the 
intent of getting her to do a story on it?  She might be a good "carrier."  
Thoughts?  One story has already hit the SJ Mercury News.

Best,
Jeff
