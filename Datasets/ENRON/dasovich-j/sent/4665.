You weren't too late afterall.  You know I don't mind eating really late.
I'm glad you liked it.

The dinner was incredibly delicious.  Thank you very much.  I apologize
for
being so late--increasingly I have less and less control over my
schedule.
Would have much preferred to have spent it with you guys.  And sorry
that I
pooped out so early---I'm running on zero sleep and had a 7:30
conference
call this morning.

That said, the dinner was really extraordinary.  You guys outdid
yourself.
Made an others tough day very nice.  Thanks.

Best,
Jeff
