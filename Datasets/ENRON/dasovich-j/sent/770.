Sue, Mona, and Dasovich--

Would one of you be available for about 30 mins or so tomorrow p.m. (Thurs)=
=20
to square away this issue (maybe around 3 or 4 or so)?  My recollection of=
=20
our original contract language was to capture all of the post-transition=20
period CTCs as set forth in AB1890, so maybe we just need to broaden or=20
clarify what we mean by "residual CTCs".  I'll actually be at 101 Cal=20
starting in the p.m. tomorrow, so this could work out pretty well. =20
Otherwise, I'll be in SR on Friday and then in SoCal next week but back in=
=20
SFO on next Weds for a two day LSI seminar (Dasovich you're speaking at it?=
)=20
Thurs and Fri so we could discuss then too.

Sorry for the short notice and I hope I'll at least be able to say hi to=20
everyone tomorrow.

Andy

Attached is a version of AB1890.  I refer you to pages 31 through 36 which=
=20
discusses Sections 367 through 368.

Residual CTCs may have two connotations.  The first connotation is the type=
=20
of CTC recovery during the rate freeze period.  For example, the California=
=20
IOUs bill customers based on frozen rates.  From those frozen rates, delive=
ry=20
and procurement costs are subtracted.  What is left over residually is the=
=20
recovery of CTCs.  The interpretation that you are implementing is the CTCs=
=20
that are recovered after the frozen rate period.  Due to these two possible=
=20
interpretations, I believe that either the term "residual CTCs" needs to be=
=20
defined or a better definition of the "Pre-Rolloff Period" and "Post-Rollof=
f=20
Period."

After reading the cites that I referred to above, if you believe the=20
definition incorporates the guidelines implemented through Sections 367 and=
=20
368, then I will be comfortable with the current language.  My concern was=
=20
that the CPUC may adopt changes to the recovery plan per Section 368 that=
=20
would disadvantage ESPs and DA customers, and only benefit and protect=20
Standard Offer customers.  Pursuant to Section 368, the IOUs implemented co=
st=20
recovery plans to recover costs that meet the criteria in Section 367.  I a=
m=20
worried that customers may be confused by plans that may be implemented in =
a=20
the Post-Rolloff periods that may look like the original cost recovery plan=
s=20
(i.e. SDG&E's rate cap).

You can contact Susan Mara, Jeff Dasovich, or Mona Petrochko in Government=
=20
Affairs for better clarification if needed.

The reference to "but not including any extension pursuant to Section=20

Tim,

Thanks for forwarding me the contract.  In Section 3(a), there is a=20
definition for "Post-Rolloff Period" which states, "shall mean, with respec=
t=20
to each Facility, the period of time commencing with the day after the last=
=20
day of the Pre-Rolloff Period.....but not including any extension period=20
pursuant to Section 3(g)(ii).  The problem is that I cannot find Section=20
3(g)(i) in the contract.

Further, the definition of "Pre-Rolloff Period" which states, "...ending on=
=20
the last day the UDC for such Facility is authorized to collect CTCs (but=
=20
excluding residual CTCs) in its service territory under AB1890," is=20
ambiguous.  There are two possible solutions.  One possible solution is to=
=20
define the term "residual CTCs".  Another solution is to redraft the langua=
ge=20
to be more specific referencing the PU Codes Section 367 and 368 enacted by=
=20
AB1890.

You are correct regarding the impact to the mark if the transition period=
=20
ends differently than we expect.

The contract specifies that the transition period ends in accordance with=
=20
AB1890, as noted in the attatched Gart contract.  We have, however,=20
instructed the attorney to change the contract template to also specify tha=
t=20
under no circumstances is the transition period to be later than 3/2002.  I=
=20
have not received a version of that contract.

I like this deal structure because it provides a hedge for our current book=
=20
in California.  Correct me if I am wrong, but if the end of the transition=
=20
period ends earlier than priced, then our mark for this deal should increas=
e=20
because we are providing the discount off the frozen bundled price for a=20
shorter period than expected.  Conversely, if the rate freeze ends later th=
an=20
how we priced it, then the mark for this deal will decrease because we will=
=20
have provided a discount off of the frozen tariff for a period longer than =
we=20
had priced.  This impact on the mark is converse to the current risk profil=
e=20
of our California portfolio.

My main concern is the contract language on how the transition period is=20
defined.  It is important that this language is crafted to leave no loose=
=20
ends.  Can you please send me a copy of the clauses that define the end of=
=20
the transition period, which is a critical date because the delivery risks=
=20
hinge on that definition.  I just want to do some preventative maintenance,=
=20
such that we do not enter contract dispute over this issue in the future. =
=20
However, we may proceed signing this contract if necessary.  I would just=
=20
like to follow up on the issue for future deals if it is too late for this=
=20
deal.  As a matter of fact, I would not even try to change the contract=20
language on this deal because the customer may become overly concern.

I recommend that Scott signs the DASH for Gart Sports for now.
