I'll see you at 5:15 outside at the ticket counter level.  I'm taking Alaska.

I'll pick you up at 5:15 or so outside at the ticket counter level.  I need 
to put you in a cab for the ride back to the hotel--so I can get home around 
7:30.  I'll have a draft of the presentation ready for you to review.    

If things get screwed up, I'll call your cell phone voicemail and leave a 
message.  Below is the restaurant.  It's in SE, Portland.  A little different 
experience then eating downtown or in NW.  

The restaurant is essentially on the corner of Bybee and Milwaukie, in the 
Westmoreland area.
