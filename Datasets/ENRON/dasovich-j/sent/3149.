I'm holding up just fine.  Thanks a bunch for caring.  Have a great time in 
the Virgin Islands!  Is it a Survivor gig?

We missed you too.  Everybody is kind of worried about you....and hoping that 
you're holding out o.k..  Barbara wasn't able to make it and Marchris was 
hanging out with Governor Jeb, so we had a smaller group.  I just got back to 
Mpls and am heading off to the Virgin Islands on Saturday.
