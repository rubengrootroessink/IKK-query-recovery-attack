Well, I was clearly too ambitious in setting out the schedule.  My 
apologies.  I managed to trudge through the reading and the document last 
night, but didn't not get to answering the question.  I appears that this 
will be a busy weekend.  I've a feeling that I won't get my proposed answer 
to folks until Saturday afternoon for your review.  If that poses a problem 
for anyone, please let me know.  I still intend to be the compiler of wisdom, 
so folks should feel free to distribute when they've got something drafted.

Best,
Jeff
