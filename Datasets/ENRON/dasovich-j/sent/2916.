Dear Jeff and Mike:

Per your request, I have put together a draft letter to the CPUC seeking
relief from PG&E's diversions.  I drafted it so that it could be signed by a
group of suppliers and non-core customers.

This letter could also be converted relatively easy to a pleading if that
approach is determined to be preferable.

Let me know if you want to  pursue this further.

Jim McT
