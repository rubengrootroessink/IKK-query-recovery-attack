Hi -- I'd very much like to stay in touch as well.  I just finished 
speaking with Rep. Dan Schaefer -- he called to see how I was holding up in 
all of this election mess.  He confirmed what you said: this thing is only 
getting started.  I told him about Jesse Knight's initiative in San Diego 
to allow businesses to collectively buy electricity, and he was so pleased 
about it.  "That's exactly what we talked about!," he said.

I'll be around the rest of the month, so if we can get together that would 
be excellent.

Let me know if you have any more need for some San Diegan eyes and ears. 
Have a great afternoon --

Dana
