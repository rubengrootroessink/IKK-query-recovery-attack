Mike:
Can't thank you guys enough for coming.  It was a great time, and Prentice 
was really happy that you made it.  Hope you didn't get too much of a 
headache listening to me play (?) the bass.  Please pass along thanks to 
Lisa, and no reciprocation needed.  Great to have you.  Happy holidays.

Best,
Jeff
