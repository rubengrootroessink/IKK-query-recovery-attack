Could be me, but that doesn't look like your email address.  You get this 
email from Jeremy (good guy who works with Steve)?

Sue:


To follow up from yesterdays' call with us, we are going to revise the 
California ETI tariff(s) to parallel your national Enron template.  We are 
also looking at Pacific Bell's Tariff CAL. PUC No. 175T to determine their 
current Dedicated Transport service tariffed rates, and will advise. 
We have a PDF version of the Master Sales Agreement, and are incorporating 
some minor revisions - and maintaining the Contract as governing over the 
tariff.  I believe we also needed input from Enron Broadband Sales on the 
California customer Forms for filing with the updated tariffs. 
If you could pass along the template so we can change the services, that 
would be greatly appreciated.  Please let us know any questions,
