I'm getting him deck railing, a new pump, a new fire place, new skylights, a 
new roof, and a new car.

Even if my diet consisted solely of rare African roots, I'd still go to La 
Folie for your 40th. I understand that you don't want to make people do what 
they don't really want to do, but this is also about you, the celebration of 
the 40th year of your life, etc. Fuck everyone else. Anyway, from what I've 
heard, everyone's cool with Folie. After all, the wine ain't half bad. But, 
I'll be leaving all this up to the Lone Mountain Sisters (and not their 
current bluegrass boyfriends).

I'm happy to hear it's the man in black's b-day. Hopefully he'll stay around 
for many more.

LATE!

PS I meant to ask last night: what the hell are we getting Eldon for his 
birthday?
