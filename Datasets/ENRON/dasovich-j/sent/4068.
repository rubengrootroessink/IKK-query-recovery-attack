I was afraid you'd ask that.  Don't know the exact number, but I'm assuming 
that it's a whole heckuvalot less than the May 1-December 31 exposure.

Best,
Jeff

Could be.  What is our post-12/31/00 exposure?

Interesting bit from SCE's MOU (p. 31) -

"the CPUC Implementing Decisions shall include

Orders resolving the responsibility of SCE to provide credits to direct 
access customers in respect of electricity deliveries after December 31, 2000 
in respects which do not result in any material financial detriment to SCE; "

Translation:  I suppose this means SCE is looking for an order absolving it 
of any responsibility for PX credits after 12/31/00, but implicitly, that 
seems to suggest they accept responsibility for PX credits before 12/31/00.  
Do you agree?
