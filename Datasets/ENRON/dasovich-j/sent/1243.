        I just received a notice of reassignment of the Gas Strategy OII from 
ALJ Andrea Biren to ALJ John Wong.  I wanted to also mention on the 
conference call that the PD did not have ALJ Biren's name on it, which led me 
to wonder how much of the PD was her writing.

Here is the draft letter. We received no input from anyone.  So this 
represents our best shot.  Please edit mercilessly.   Please share only with 
CSA signatories.  Please comment by email or in person or by phone at the 
socalgas meeting, where I will distribute the letter and seek support. 
Thanks, Mike Day
