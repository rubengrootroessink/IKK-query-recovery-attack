Poll thus far:
Aron Thomas (AES) just decided not to file.  He made the decision after 
talking to Edison, who told him that Edison is going to suggest in its filing 
that the surcharge be applied--get this--to the PX credit; thus, ESPs would 
pay, but then get it back through the credit (can you say "poor quality 
receivables"?).  Aron feels that the issue should be figured out in work 
shops and the Commission should not decide it in the policy phase.
Bill Booth (CLECA) is going to remain silent on the issue because he doesn't 
know what the position of his members is.
Keith McCrae (CMA) is going to say that 1) the surcharge should not apply to 
direct acces customers and 2) the governor stated publicly that he supports 
direct access.

Jeanne's checking with the Industrial Users Group to see what they're going 
to say.  Since CMA is going to ask for clarification, I would suggest that we 
remain silent and focus on the other rate design/cost allocation issues, 
e.g., equity, no cross subsidies.  

Thoughts?

I let you know what I hear back from Jeanne.

Best,
Jeff
