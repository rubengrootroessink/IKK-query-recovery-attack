Hey Jeff,

I signed you up as my roommate for the mid term retreat. I hadn't set
anything up with anyone else and when I went to the EMBA office to see
who was still open I noticed that you hadn't either. If in the mean
time, you have set something up with someone else, don't sweat it. They
said they could change it. I hope you haven't though because I think it
would be fun.

See you Sunday.
