Hi Maureen:

Steve should have received via fax from Scott Govenar a letter to Hertzberg 
and Burton from the Republican leadership in the CA Legislature.  The letter 
1) conveys a strong willingness on the part of the Republicans to work 
together to solve the problem and 2) provides an outline of the key 
components of a comprehensive solution.  Could you please get a copy of the 
letter to Rosalee; and Rosalee could you get a copy of the letter to Ken 
Lay?    Thanks very much for your help.

Best,
Jeff
