Here are some suggestions for the op-ed piece.  One general comment:  It may 
be a bit lengthy at this point.  Also, have we decided whether it would be 
our op-ed piece?  

And one key point that is very commercially sensitive:  The term "end the 
rate freeze" has very ominous implications for EES's book, depending on the 
timing of any such "end" in California.  Thus my heavy-handed edits on that 
portion.

Nice job, Jeannie.

Best,
Jeff
