FYI.  Please keep confidential until further notice.  Important to note that 
this was delivered with the understanding that NO ONE has agreed to the 
specific language.  It was a quick turn around (at Hertzberg's request) to 
get the original, negotiated agreement into Legislative language (i.e., 
Martian) as soon as possible so that Hertzberg could try to move on it in the 
Legislature as soon as possible.

In addition, the Commission is likely to come out with its proposed "rate 
agreement" sometime this week, and is likely to release DWR's "revenue 
requirement" next week.  I heard from the Gov's financial advisor that Edison 
and DWR EACH want 2 cents out of the PUC's recent 3 cent rate increase.  It's 
going to get very interesting from here.

Best,
Jeff

Rick-
Attached please find our final draft of legislative language per your
request. We are ready and willing to draft other sections or language as
needed by you or the Speaker. Please feel free to contact me if you have any
questions about the draft. Please note there are disagreements over two
sections of language and they are so marked.

FYI - I will be sending this document out to the entire Working Group for
their information.

Thank you,
Delaney
