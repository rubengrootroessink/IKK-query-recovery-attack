Yeah, tell me about it.   (Payback for what!?!?)

So that means you DON'T enjoy my loving ribbing?

P.S. My butt still feels like there's all these rubberbands wrapped around 
it......(:

So you packed up our entire car and left all your stuff - what a concept.

Payback is hell.

The bad news is I left my bag with clothes and toiletries at the Dome.  The
good news is it's a great excuse to have to go up again this weekend!

Thanks again for everything.  Really nice with only the
principals---smaller, more intimate, less mess---and the ping pong table is
a HUGE hit.

I hope you enjoy my loving ribbing as much as I enjoy yours.

Best,
Jeff
