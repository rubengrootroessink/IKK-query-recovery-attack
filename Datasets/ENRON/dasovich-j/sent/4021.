NEWSMAKER PROFILE 
Dennis Montali 
Bankruptcy Judge Faces Challenge of His Career 
Well-known expert in complex cases

A veteran federal bankruptcy judge in San Francisco now is calling the shots 
in California's long, drawn-out power crisis. 
Judge Dennis Montali has spent eight years helping financially ailing dot- 
coms, consumers and corporations get back on their financial feet. Now he is 
about to take on the biggest case of his career, and lawyers say that he is 
relishing the challenge. 
"He's one of the best judges in the country," said Lawrence Goldberg, a San 
Francisco bankruptcy lawyer with Goldberg, Stinnett, Meyers & Davis. "He 
loves his job and he loves this kind of combat when lawyers come to court." 
Montali, 60, has built a reputation as a hard-working, enthusiastic judge who 
often knows the facts of a case better than the lawyers. He is a scholar of 
bankruptcy law, having lectured and written law review articles. The more 
complicated the case, lawyers say, the more energized he becomes. 
On a personal level, he can strike the fine balance between the demands of 
the commercial world and the plight of the consumer trying to overcome a 
mountain of credit card debts, lawyers say. 
"He's an excellent draw for the case," said bankruptcy lawyer Shawn 
Christianson, with Buchalter, Nemer, Fields & Younger. She said that Montali 
has a combination of pragmatism, intellect and experience that will help him 
understand the problems of all those involved in this statewide crisis. 
Tall and lanky with a handle-bar mustache, Montali is a native of the Bay 
Area. Born in San Francisco, his father worked as a liquor distributor and 
later founded Montali Winery -- later Audubon Cellars -- in Berkeley. The 
young Montali earned his undergraduate degree from Notre Dame University and 
then entered the Navy to fulfill a Reserve Officers Training Corps 
commitment. 
After his discharge in 1965, he entered the University of California's Boalt 
School of Law in Berkeley and earned his law degree in 1968. 
He joined the law firm of 
Rothschild and Phelan in San Francisco and quickly developed a specialty in 
bankruptcy law. By the time he joined the legal giant Pillsbury, Madison & 
Sutro in 1980 he was an established expert. 
While he represented debtors early on in his career, he became a creditor's 
attorney at Pillsbury and quickly built a national reputation for his 
knowledge and his active role in the bankruptcy law community. 
In 1993, the U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco chose him for an opening 
on the federal bankruptcy court in Northern California. 
One of two bankruptcy judges in San Francisco, he has become an expert in 
doing emergency surgery on companies in critical condition, able to deal with 
crises quickly and with few complications. 
He has gained national prominence as a member of the National Conference of 
Bankruptcy Judges and the American College of Bankruptcy. He also was 
rewarded with an appointment to the bankruptcy appellate panel. 
When he's not bailing out a company, he spends his off hours cooking Italian 
food at his Berkeley home with his wife, Mary. He also loves to sail, walk 
his dog and spend time with his granddaughter. 
"He's going to put his heart into this one," said Larry Engel, a veteran 
bankruptcy lawyer with San Francisco's Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison. "He's got 
the respect of everyone in terms of his fairness and diligence." 
"California," he added, "is in really good hands in having the case with 
him."

When to Hold 'Em, Fold 'Em: It might be a long time before PG&E shares 
rebound

U172804.DTL 

If you own PG&E stock, you really need to ask yourself whether you're 
prepared to endure the agony of the next few years. 
When companies go bankrupt, common stockholders are the last to be paid, 
after trade, secured and unsecured creditors. 
Because there are usually not enough assets to pay off all those creditors in 
full, in many cases the creditors give up part of their claims in exchange 
for stock in the reorganized company that emerges from bankruptcy. This 
vastly dilutes the ownership stake of existing shareholders. 
In many cases, the original shareholders end up with a small fraction of 
stock in the reorganized company. And that's after a protracted court 
proceeding that could take two to five years. During that period, there's 
little reason for the stock to rise. 
Although it was Pacific Gas & Electric -- PG&E Corp.'s utility subsidiary -- 
that filed for bankruptcy yesterday, stock in the parent company fell $4.18 
per share to $7.20, and most Wall Street investors see little hope for a 
quick rebound. 
"This is going to be a long, drawn-out process," says Claude Cody, manager of 
AIM Global Utilities Fund, which owns stock in PG&E. "There is going to be 
negative news and positive news, and generally the negative news comes out 
first." 
Cody explains that when a company is in bankruptcy, the flow of information 
slows down. Many institutional investors won't own stock in a bankrupt 
company, 
and analysts stop following it. 
All the usual methods of valuing a stock, such as price-earnings ratios, 
become meaningless. 
Companies in bankruptcy hardly ever pay dividends. 
PG&E has already suspended its dividend and won't pay one as long as the 
utility is in bankruptcy. 
That's hard on people such as Lee Fischer of San Bruno, who bought PG&E stock 
20 years ago. Fischer, 72, says PG&E accounted for about 15 percent of the 
stock dividends he depends on for retirement income. 
"Everybody said, 'Buy utilities, buy oil, they're always going to be there, ' 
" he says. 
"I'm pretty upset with our governor. I'm mad at PG&E. They're making 
decisions we have no control over. I'm already losing the money I'm putting 
into my monthly (utility) bills. It's not fair. My emotions are running 
rampant at this point." 
There are some reasons Fischer and other PG&E shareholders could fare better 
than most stockholders involved in a typical bankruptcy. 
For one thing, shareholders own stock in the parent company, which has some 
unregulated energy assets that could provide cash flow and some support for 
the stock price, provided that creditors of the utility can't seize the 
assets of the unregulated subsidiary. 
PG&E has taken steps to prevent that, but those steps are sure to be 
challenged in court -- a process that could add to the length and complexity 
of the utility's bankruptcy proceeding. 
"In most bankruptcy cases, you don't have this two-sided isolation. 
Shareholders are not getting money from a solvent side while there's an 
insolvent side," says Lynn LoPucki, a law professor with the University of 
California at Los Angeles. 
Given its size, stature, the essential nature of its product and its 
importance to the state's economy, some experts say PG&E's bankruptcy could 
be resolved relatively quickly -- maybe in two years instead of three. 
For the very same reasons, others say it will bog down. 
PG&E stock is down 77 percent from its high last September. But that doesn't 
mean it can't go lower. 
Walter Torous, a finance professor at the Anderson School of Management at 
UCLA, has studied what happens to stocks after bankruptcies and found that on 
average, they don't do well. 
"You'd think that if a company announces bankruptcy it takes a one-time hit. 
But it continues to underperform badly over the long term. The market doesn't 
seem to quickly incorporate this bad news," says Torous. 
Torous tracked 78 large companies that filed for bankruptcy between 1979 and 
1983. 
He found that during the first year after they filed, their stocks trailed 
the overall market by 38 percentage points. Over two years, they 
underperformed by 57 percentage points. Over three years, they trailed by 
almost 100 percentage points. (He explains that if the market went up 50 
percent and the bankrupt stocks went down by 50 percent, they would trail by 
100 percentage points). 
Torous says that because the companies he studied all went bankrupt around 
the same time, they might not be representative of companies going bankrupt 
during other periods. 
Marty Whitman, manager of the Third Avenue Value Fund, points out that in 
past utility bankruptcies -- such as Public Service Co. of New Hampshire and 
Northeast Utilities -- shareholders who held on came out well, after a number 
of years. 
"In other utility bankruptcies, they've all been reorganized on the backs of 
the ratepayers and taxpayers," he says. 
Whitman, who doesn't own PG&E stock but does own secured bonds in the 
utility, was irate yesterday that PG&E didn't "prepackage" its bankruptcy. 
That would have involved getting all the parties involved to agree to a 
reorganization plan before filing for bankruptcy. 
"If they did it preplanned, they could be in and out (of bankruptcy) in six 
months," Whitman says. 
Instead, he says it could take two to three years. 
Mark Luftig, co-manager of the Strong American Utilities Fund, does not own 
the stock and considers it a highly speculative investment. "If you can put 
it away for three years, there's an above-average chance you'll get an above- 
average return," says Luftig. "Will you miss a lot of sleep in the meantime? 
Probably." 
MOODY'S GROWS NERVOUS: Debt-rating agency Moody's said yesterday that it 
changed its outlook on the state of California's general obligation bonds to 
negative from stable, "reflecting our view that the deepening electric power 
crisis -- compounded by (yesterday's) bankruptcy filing by Pacific Gas & 
Electric Co. -- has increased the risks to the state's otherwise strong 
fiscal and economic condition." 
Moody's is the second bond-rating agency to warn that it might downgrade the 
state's credit rating because of the power crisis. 
In January, Standard & Poor's put the state's credit rating, currently AA, on 
"CreditWatch" with negative implications.
