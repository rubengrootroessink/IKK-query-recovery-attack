Dirk/Jay - thanks for the quick response.  I want to insure we have 
accurately portrayed the situation to you both (the real duration of our 
requests, and the real response time of the utilities).  Don't want anyone to 
walk into a response of "..... we've only had that request for XX days....".  
We do need help though if we want to achieve our aggressive schedule.    

We are falling behind our target schedule due to a lack of pulse meter 
contact installations.  How hard would it be to get informal org charts for 
the metering side of SCE, SDGE, and PGE (just simple bob works for jim who 
works for tom who reports to bill), and......, to identify who (within 
Enron/CEC/ISO) has the relationship(s) with those groups?  

The execution side of the boxter effort asked Jay who they could talk to to 
insure we were working "smart" in California with respect to getting interval 
meters modified to include pulse contacts.  The execution team wants to 
insure that we aren't standing in the wrong long line.  We want to know who 
we could/should call to express our "appreciation" for all their cooperation, 
and to insure they knew our aggressive timetable.   How many times have 
you/we heard "........ oh....., that's what you are doing....., if someone 
had just called me........, I could have........".  

The request for "contacts" (and to know the metering org chart inside each of 
these three utilities) was so we could attempt to penetrate those three org's 
(SCE, SDGE, PG&E) at the optimum level.  Additionally - if we have acct mgmt 
folks that have relationships - we want to leverage those.  

Tom - can you provide to those listed above the short exec summary of what we 
have requested from SDGE, SCE, PGE, and...., what their response has been 
(use the attached XLS chart).  Help charactarize when we officially made 
request, so that we provide an accurate perception of the three utility's 
responses.  

Thx

Jeff, we are rolling out a CEC/CALISO curtailment initiative in California 
that provides major benefits to our customers. Before the program can be 
implemented, customer facilities need to be equipped with a pulse generating 
meter (a modified version of a regular meter). As we are no longer the MSP we 
now have to rely on the UDCs to install these meters. We fully expect to pay 
for these installations but we are getting major push back in SCE and PG&E 
territory with respect to scheduling these installations. If we were to go by 
PG&E's schedule (12 weeks), the summer will be over and most benefits will be 
lost.

We are under the impression that Enron is plain dirt in the eyes of the UDC 
employees, and we are being singled out by the rank and file folks as the 
major culprit for the energy crisis. However primitive that opinion is, we 
are stuck with it. Please note Jay Ferry's contention below.

Is there a way for you to nudge some UDC executives and ask them to instruct 
their field crews to start cooperating?  We could use the help.

Dirk,

We have been working with Mike Connaly and his boss, Mel Calais, at SCE to 
expedite deployment of pulse meters.  Do you know the chain of command there 
and if there is anyone higher that we could call if work continues to move 
along at a snail's pace.  Please call me (713-646-7086) or respond by e-mail, 
if you can't reach me.

Thanks,
j
