Jim:  To say that there was gaming in the UK pool is a significant 
understatement.  Couple thoughts...I'm pretty sure that Seab has done 
extensive analysis on the UK and he'd likely therefore be very useful in 
developing rebuttal. (Though very close to it at one point, I've been removed 
for a few years.)  Also, Schroeder and his gang could also likely shed some 
insights, and seems that Schroeder's pretty close now with Littlechild---that 
might be another avenue for information to rebut.

Best,
Jeff
