David:  Accusing market participants of "gaming," "strategic behavoir," 
"market manipulation," and the like will be extremely controversial, and, I 
believe, unconstructive.  As you may or may not know, much of the criticism 
was placed on the utilities strategic bidding on the demand side, which many 
"economists" and "consultants" seem quite willing and able to conveniently 
ignore.
