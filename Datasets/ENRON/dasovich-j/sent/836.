OK.  Looks like Saturday's out.  I'm game for tomorrow.  Morning?  
Afternoon?  We can meet at my office if you'd like, or at a cafe.  Let me 
know.

Best,
Jeff

Hello everyone,

I thought I missed something last night - there were four accidents on my 
way home so I didn't even get into the city until 7:30 pm.  I checked my 
email and didn't see anything so I don't feel so guilty now.

I can meet on the weekend whenever.
