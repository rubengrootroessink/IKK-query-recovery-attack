Got a call that Loretta Lynch and Rod Wright, among others, spoke at 
yesterday's annual meeting of regulation lawyers.  The following was very 
briefly relayed to me:  

President Lynch said that 1) de-regulation was founded on ideology, not 
facts; 2) she wants to completely re-organize the PUC, top to bottom (in her 
image?  Amen); 3) she frowns on lobbying---if you "come knocking on her door, 
that's a strike against you."  One should participate, along with the rest of 
the public, through the hearing process.

Rod Wright said that businesses (including Enron) are being frustrated by 
rules and regs that act as unnecessary impediments.
