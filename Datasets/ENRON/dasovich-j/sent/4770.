I've received a copy of the powerpoint presentation Hertzberg made to the his 
caucus.  Unfortunately, it's a fax and hardly legible.  I can make out, 
however, that it is the core/noncore plan.  I'm attempting to get a better 
copy and will distribute as soon as I get my hands on it.  Please keep 
confidential that we have a copy.  Thanks.

Best,
Jeff
