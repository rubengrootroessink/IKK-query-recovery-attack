I can be on the call.  Please let me know if you get this, since I've been 
having severe email problems.  Thanks.


Best,
Jeff

  Please confirm that this schedule works.  It is the only day
that worked for everyone.  Jeff Dasovich is still in the Sierras so I can 
check
in with him Monday.

  The agenda sounds simple but don't be deceived, there are many
many options.  Please be prepared with a list of 3 top speaker choices.

  1.  Topics of panels.

  2.  Speaker list.  Try to agree on an 'A' list who we can start
calling and a 'B' list of alternates.
