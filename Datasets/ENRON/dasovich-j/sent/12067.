Anything can happen, but Hedy just talked to the Executive Offficer of the 
Senate Rules committee who told her that it is very unlikely that the full 
Senate would vote on any contempt report before the Senate leaves for recess; 
that is, they likely wouldn't vote on anything until they return in August.

Other info from the conversation:
With respect to fines, sanctions, etc., he said that "they're making it up as 
they go."
Any vote on fines, etc. would only a require a simple majority to pass.
