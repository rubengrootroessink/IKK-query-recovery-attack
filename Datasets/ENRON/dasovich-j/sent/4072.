Greetings:

Sue Landwehr will be sending around a more comprehensive summary of what 
happened at today's FERC hearnig in Boise but asked me to pass along the 
following.

Each state was only allowed to have two people at the table.  For California 
it was Assembly Speaker Hertzberg and Geoff Brown (newly appointed CA PUC 
Commissioner).  

Hertzberg did a credible, matter-of-fact job of explaining what California's 
doing to resolve the crisis (nice to know that there's someone out there who 
can explain what the heck California's doing).  Hertzberg then asked that 
FERC do "its part" by imposing price caps in Western wholesale markets.

Hertzberg didn't mention the PG&E bankruptcy or Davis' deal with Edison.

Overall, the "no price cap" message won the day (though Breathitt seems to be 
under considerable pressure to give in to caps).

The Governor of Arizona (Jane Hull) had a staffer deliver a letter signed by 
9 republicant governors opposing price caps.  Sue will be distributing the 
letter.

Best,
Jeff
