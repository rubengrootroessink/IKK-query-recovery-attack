FYI.  My understanding is that Martin and Doug are going to be focused on DG 
in California.

Highlights of today's meeting:

Next week there will be a big push to get contracts signed from the First 
Energy customers from whom we received commitments.  There are approximately 
120 MWs of load we hope to sign up, using First Energy's Market Support 
Generation.  We also need to prepare a PR plan in case our contracted load is 
significantly less than our acquired generation.

Cinergy is being targeted as a new commodity opportunity.  The intent is to 
take advantage of the shopping incentive made available to the first 20% of 
load that switches when the Ohio market opens 1/1/01.

The Texas Commission's ruling allowing negative stranded costs will not yet 
be marked into the retail curves due to the uncertainty surrounding the 
decision.  

Personnel issues:

Mark Courtney is now the regional sales lead for Texas, replacing Jay Ferry.

Eric Letke is now the regional sales lead for California, replacing Doug 
Condon.
