Greetings.  I have a conflict in the morning, but could join by conference 
calling beginning at 2 pm.  Is that possible.  If not, no big deal.  I, like 
Ralph, will catch up at the next meeting, and submit our ideas to Eve between 
now and then.  Let me know.  And I agree with Ralph re: staying focused on 
the most urgent issues.

Best,
Jeff

Colleagues:  it turns out that at this hour I will be presiding over hearings 
in
Wyoming on the disposal of wastes from nuclear weapons (your condolences are
gratefully accepted).  I hope to join the next meeting, whenever it is.  My
advice remains what I said at our Dec. 1 meeting:  let's try to help the
legislature stay focused for now on the most urgent electricity issues that
absolutely must be addressed now:  forward contracting in the wholesale 
markets
to reduce customers' exposure to very high and volatile wholesale prices, and 
a
rate stabilization plan to deal with the issues surrounding this year's
wholesale costs.  If we can help narrow the immediate issues to those, and 
frame
the differences and decisions that remain, we'll have made a useful
contribution.
