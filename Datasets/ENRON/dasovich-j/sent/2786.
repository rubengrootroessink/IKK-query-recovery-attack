Thanks.  I was literally just about to call the Portland desk.  You saved me 
the trouble.  Did they say whether they have any plans to cut PG&E off (from 
gas sales) in the near future?

FYI, Mark just walked down to the trading floor, and we have not stopped 
selling to PG&E.  Apparently, the ISO put out another list and we're on it. kd
