Thanks.  Remind me to tell you the story of the time that I was on a panel 
with him. Yours is the most succint description of him that I've heard to 
date.  Was curious whether his rant was getting any traction with people that 
matter.  Sounds like it isn't.

I don't know if you know the history behind McCullough.  He is a consultant 
who primarily advises industrial loads.  He advised his customers that prices 
were going down and that they should go on index based tariffs rather than 
fixed-price tariffs.  Needless to say, his advise cost his customers a great 
deal of money.  Notable examples are Bellingham Cold Storage and Georgia 
Pacific in Puget Sound Energy's service territory.  Rather than acknowledge 
that he was wrong, Robert is on a witch hunt.  His data is bad, his analysis 
is horrible, he lies with numbers but does a good job being pompous and 
putting together flashy power point presentations.  I have not heard of 
anybody agreeing with him, including the NWPPC, CEC, CAISO, CAPX.  He is a 
loud entertaining speaker, so I am sure that he will continue to get coverage.

Have there been any more reactions to the presentation that McCullough made 
at the "volatility conference" in Portland last week?
