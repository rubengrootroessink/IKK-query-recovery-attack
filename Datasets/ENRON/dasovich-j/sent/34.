Glad to hear it went well.  Debra never called.

Not at all, keep pushing for stellar.  That's what everyone wants.

Things went very well in Portland.  Belden, Kaufman, and Steffes seem very
interested and positive.  It is kind of a culture shock to see young people 
like
Belden carrying so much weight.  Its a refreshing change from most utilities 
and
govt agencies where age seems to be a prerequisite for responsibility, and
reminds me of when your former boss Gigi Coe said to me that the CPUC couldn't
hire more young people because of age discrimination issues (if that's not a
perverse result of a well-meaning policy...).

Whatever happened to Debra Stump, do you know?  She was the GSPP class of 2000
that we had exchanged some messages about last spring.
