Laura:
Attached are the letters that I referenced in the previous email.  The

transmission lines)
oppose  SBX6--Burton (state takes significant position in generation, gas & 
electric transmission, energy conservation, renewable resources, real-time 
meters

Again, if you have any questions don't hesitate to contact me at 415.782.7822.
