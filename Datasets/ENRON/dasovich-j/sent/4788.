Thanks very much Rosalee.

Karen:
Do you have a copy of the Dow Jones article?  I'd like to email the piece to 
Brulte, if you don' t have any objections.

Best,
Jeff

1.  Just wanted to let you know that not every Californian agrees with our  
Attorney General. 
2. Read with interest a Dow Jones story regarding about a 4 page proposal  
Enron gave to Speaker Hertzberg allowing large commercial customers. 
3.  Would love to see that proposal. 
4.  Thanks.
