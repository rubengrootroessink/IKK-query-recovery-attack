Bill:  In order to assess, I need to understand the structure.  What's the 
contract structure look like now?  What are we proposed to change, including 
counterparties?  What part of the existing contract required any PUC approval 
and why?  What is Edison saying needs to happen at the PUC?

Thanks.

Best,
Jeff

Bill,
I was referring to the PDA (WAPA) which expires 1 OCT 01.  We've been
advised it would take 6-8 months to cycle thru the CPUC after submittal.
I'm thinking it doesn't necessarily have to take that long before
approval/implementation...what do you think?
Paul

Good morning, Paul.  I apologise for not getting back to you yesterday, but
I am stuck in Seattle, and because of the earthquake, all flights are
cancelled, andI haven't been able to get on line until this morning.  It
has affected the phone connections.

There hasn't been much movement in the positions regarding open access in
the past week, so a conference call will not be fruitful at the moment.
The possible exception to this may be provided by Jeff Dasovich, who is
going to a meeting in Sacramento today.  If new information is promulgated
by that meeting, Jeff will email me, and I will set up a call for tomorrow.
Otherwise, let's plan on next Friday.  As usual, I will get breaking
information to you when it happens.

Also, in your last email, you said that someone from SCE is telling you
that it will take 6-8 months for the CPUC to process a new contract, and
Edwards was concerned that this may impact the PDA.  For clarification, the
"new contract" you referred to--is that the potential contract for
electricity that  we have been working on, or are you referring to
something else?

Hope I can get out of here today!

Regards,
Bill

Hello to the Direct Access Coalition:

Below you will find a summary of the press strategy that Edelman Public
Relations intends to employ over the coming weeks in collaboration with the
Alliance for Retail Energy Markets and the broader Direct Access Coalition.
I will also outline the information that I need from Direct Access
Coalition
members who are willing to be involved in media outreach and interviews.
And finally, I have attached supporting documents that you can use as
background material to prep for your responses to any media inquiries that
you may receive.

This Week

1.   We are drafting a "pitch letter" to send out by the end of this week
via blast e-mail and fax to the following media lists: 1)capitol press
corps
reporters; 2) mainstream media reporters working the energy crisis; and 3)
trade media.  We may also outreach to our editorial board list as well.
Our
pitch will be focused on what it will really mean for small business and
C&I
customers to lose the option of retail choice at a time when they are
suffering the financial hardships of skyrocketing energy bills. We will
address the effect on California's future business climate if direct access
is not preserved through legislation that corrects the problems that AB1x
caused for retail choice.  And finally, we will address the point that no
matter what direction California ultimately takes, direct access must be a
part of the solution.  Reporters have seen the recent polls which
illustrate
California businesses' concerns with the path the state is on so this is a
prime opportunity to build on those recent media stories.

2.    We recommend a conference call with AReM and the Direct Access
Coalition on Friday to address the questions and suggestions on the press
strategy outlined here.

3.     Determine which people in the Direct Access Coalition are willing to
take media calls on behalf of the coalition.

Next Week

1.   Follow up with key reporters who received the pitch letter.

2.   Evaluate the language of SB 27x and determine whether there will be an
opportunity to hold a news conference with Sen. Bowen in the near future.
Monitor movement at the PUC and determine whether a press conference may be
effective in this arena, or whether we may need to use the option of
sending
a media alert before the March 7 hearing, followed by a news release after
the hearing.

3.   Place op-eds (opinion pieces) with key newspapers.

4.   Contact radio news shows and TV public affairs shows (i.e. California
Capitol Week and the California Report) to secure
media interviews.

5.    Revise the SB 27x fact sheet (attached) to reflect the realities of
the amended language in SB 27x.

 What We Need From You

1.  If you are willing to speak with the media, or you have
customers/clients with a positive direct access story to tell, please
respond to this email as soon as you can with your name and contact
information.

2.  If you have draft op-eds written that need to be placed with newspapers
on behalf of your association and the broader coalition, we are willing to
do this for the you.

3.  If you have colleagues and/or staff that are already working with the
media it would be helpful to have this information so that we can
collaborate as necessary.
