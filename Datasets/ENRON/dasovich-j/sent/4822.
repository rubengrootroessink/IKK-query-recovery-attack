Hi Jeff, 

Sorry to hear about the hair.  Did not change
companies, but got a nice promotion a couple of months
ago.  We just started using the new server last month
so we can have our own company address for email,
hence the new email moniker.

Thanks for getting back to me.  If we are still
working on it next week, I will let you know.

JT
