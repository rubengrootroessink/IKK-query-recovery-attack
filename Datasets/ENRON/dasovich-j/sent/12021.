Jim, I think that the point of the "flurry" is that we in California ain't 
received anything from PG&E.  Seemed that Wanda, from her note, said that she 
is on top of it.  Can you check in with Tamara and find out what her issues 
are?  Greatly appreciated.  

(From what I heard on the phone last night, sounds like that little girl of 
yours is going to be an opera singer.)

Best,
Jeff

There's been a flurry of e-mail on this.

My original question remains -- can whomever (in Govt Affairs) received the 
PX Credit calculation info from PG&E please let me know? 

(I am working on this on several fronts, i.e. with Wanda, Diann and Mary 
Lynne.  But I do need to see the PG&E info.)

Thanks.
Tamara

Subject: trying to locate PX Credit information

PG&E has changed the method of calculating the PX Credit recently.  Prior to 
June they appeared to be using a market based price for power, but in June 
the credit dropped to about $40/MWh which looks like utility-owned gen.

We want to make sure we are not missing a utility-levied charge in our 
forward curves ( e.g. CTC charge that will be applied to DA) so we're trying 
to verify the utilities' method of calculating PX credits.

I talked to the PG&E accounting person who said that their Regulatory group 
has sent Enron's regulatory group information on the way the PX Credit is 
calculated.  Can someone locate this information and forward it to me as soon 
as possible?  Given that our customers are all switching to DA we don't want 
to discover there's a charge we don't know about.

Thanks,
Tamara.
