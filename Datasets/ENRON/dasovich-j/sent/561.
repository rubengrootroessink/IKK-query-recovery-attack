Jimmie's the "compiler" this time.  You're stuff was good.  Whether he has 
time to incorporate remains to be seen.  But I wouldn't sweat it.  We can 
talk more tonite about our somewhat "loose" but thus far effective means for 
getting these things done every week.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff,

I emailed my answers to 3 and 4 as soon as I got home last night - did
you get them and did they look OK for inclusion? I read over some of the
other members answers to the same questions and it looked like we
addressed slightly different areas on #3, so we should be able to merge
them together. On #4 I think I had a slightly different answer, I'm not
sure which is right.

Christine
