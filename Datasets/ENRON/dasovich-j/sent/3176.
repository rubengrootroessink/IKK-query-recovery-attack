Great to see you guys, and despite all the excitement, it was alot of fun.  
Hope that you made it back safely.  Couple of things:

I'd like to talk to several vineyard consultants, so if it ain't too much 
trouble, and you've got a name, I'd love to check around.
Can I order two cases of coastal zin?
What about the champagne?  How much per magnum is it?

Best,
Jeff
