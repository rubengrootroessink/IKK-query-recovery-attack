Regrettably, I am tied up in another meeting from 1:45 to 3:30 PST today.  
Could we reschedule the second part of this meeting to a later time or date?

Thanks,

It seems that 2 p.m. p.s.t. works best for all for a conference call.  The 
call-in number is 888-311-9051 passcode is 60396.

The agenda would be to discuss:

1.  interconnection agreements
2.  tax implications of c-corp vs. llp
