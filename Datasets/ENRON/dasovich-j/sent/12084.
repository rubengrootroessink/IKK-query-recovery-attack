Harry, Jeff, & Sue --

I keep getting these notes from Jeanne on different matters.

1. Is there any way to get Jeanne to start using non-CPUC terms to define the 
dockets (e.g., SCE PE Advice process)?  I have a very difficult time trying 
to figure out what material is being discussed.

2. I would like to have meeting to establish our priorities and leadership 
roles for the CPUC going forward.  Not sure how our decisionmaking is taking 
place.  I know that Harry has been taking a lot of the lead on these matters, 
but want to make sure that from a personnel focus we are doing our best.

I'll ask Linda Noske to set up a call for this Thursday am.

Thanks,

Jim

Subject: FW: To Service List A.00-10-045  SDG&E AL  1345-E

As part of its Memorandum of Understanding with DWR, SDG&E has filed the
attached advice letter.  If approved, SDG&E would be authorized to transfer
a $104 million overcollection in its TCBA to its Energy Rate Ceiling Revenue
Shortfall Account (the account established to record the revenue shortfall
from the implementation of AB 265).  The $104 million represents the
overcollection in utility retained generation revenues allocated to
customers which did not come under the AB 265 rate ceiling. That group would
include direct access customers.  SDG&E's rationale for the transfer is that
it is the legislature's intent that 100% of SDG&E's retained generation be
used to serve its 100 kW and below customers (i.e., the AB 265 customers).
SDG&E had advanced this theory in its recent rate design case.  It was
opposed by several groups and has not been ruled on by the Commission.

Protests on this advice filing are due August 6th.  Please let me know if
Enron is interested in protesting.
