Subject: URGENT FERC Hearing on Sept 12


They did it!  The jackasses changed the hearing date to Sept 12 as of 3
pm today.  A lady from FERC just called me to let me know.

My suggestion is we cancel our scheduled Board meeting, meet prior to
the 12th, and get our story in line.  Another notice will be published
by FERC regarding participation in the Hearing.

I just copied from the FERC's web page the following notice.  It appears
that FERC will hae a hearing in San Diego, possibly on Friday, Sept 15.
However, an earlier date is equally likely because all four
Commissioners are testifying at a Congressional Hearing in San Diego on
Sept 11.  I guess we need to agendize this for our next meeting, and if
the FERC holds its hearings on Sept 12, we may need to cancel our Board
meeting, and attend this.  I did call the office of External Affairs at
FERC to register WPTF as a speaker.  They were clueless, but promised to
call me back.
