Hi.  Well, wouldn't you know it.  I'm not driving tonite, but I bet that we 
could hitch a ride back with Anil.  I'm not sure, but I think that he's got 
class tonite, too.  I'll search him out before class or after that break and 
see if I can set it up.

     Jeff - Hope you had a good turkey day.  I'm going to attend finance 
     tonight (instead of last night).  I was wondering if you know if 
     anyone from the SF crew is driving over and back tonight.  I am happy 
     to take BART over, but coming back is always a pain - as you know. 
     Thanks,
     Carolyn
