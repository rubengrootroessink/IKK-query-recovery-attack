Harry:  

Seems like a good idea for you to participate to ensure that EES is in the 
loop.  Assemblyman Rod Wright's trying to find a solution that the whole 
industry can embrace, which he'd then foist on the Governor.  Sandi, Parquet 
and Day attended the first meeting last week.  I'll forward to you Parquet's 
notes from the meeting.  We'll be setting up a call in number first thing 
Monday morning.

Best,
Jeff
