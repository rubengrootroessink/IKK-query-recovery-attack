Senators Dianne Feinstein and Gordon Smith
Announce Partnership in Response to the Western Energy Crisis
March 15, 2001
Washington, DC - Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Gordon Smith (R-OR)=
=20
today announced an agreement to introduce bipartisan legislation to restore=
=20
stability and reliability to the Western energy market by directing the=20
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to impose a temporary =01&just =
and=20
reasonable=018 wholesale rate cap or cost-of-service based rates.
The legislation will also require the states involved in this effort to pas=
s=20
on the cost of the electricity to retail customers. However, the states wou=
ld=20
be able to determine how and when this would be done. In other words,=20
California could choose to use tiered-pricing, real-time pricing or set a=
=20
baseline rate above which prices would be passed through.
=01&We now have a piece of legislation that can fix the broken electricity=

market and provide a period of reliability and stability in wholesale energ=
y=20
costs,=018 Senator Feinstein said.
=01&FERC has found the wholesale prices being charged in California to be u=
njust=20
and unreasonable. This legislation essentially will mandate that once FERC=

makes such a finding, the agency will carry out its regulatory role. This i=

themselves of their generating capacity and buy most of their electricity o=

the spot market, where prices have escalated dramatically. In hindsight all=
=20
of this came together in a catastrophic scenario, so that today, California=

help restore reasonable costs and stability to this marketplace.=018
=01&Additionally, this agreement addresses the escalation of natural gas=20
