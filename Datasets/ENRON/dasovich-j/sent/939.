Hi Ginger:

Rick and I spoke and decided that it would be a good idea to provide UC 
Berkeley's Graduate School of Public Policy with a small stipend of $2,500 to 
help underwrite a conference they're sponsoring with the business school on 
Monday.  I'll be participating in the conference.

Could you please make the check payable to (the faceless)  "UC Regents" and 
send it to:

Heather Cameron
Richard and Rhoda Goldman School of Public Policy
University of California
2607 Hearst Avenue
Berkeley, CA  94720


The school's Federal Taxpayer ID is:  946002123.

Thanks very much.  If you have any questions, don't hesitate.

Best,
Jeff
