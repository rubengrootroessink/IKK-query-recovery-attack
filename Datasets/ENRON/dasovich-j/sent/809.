I think we should shy away from the 300 MW message.  It's getting in the way 
of the positive message, and the math turns out to be a bit "Goreish."  
(read: fuzzy)  I found myself wandering down all sorts of blind alleys in my 
spin to Dow Jones.  I say we generalize it more.  Something to the effect of 
"The price caps send the wrong message to the marketplace.  Whether it's gas 
lines in the seventies or bread lines in the old Soviet Union, price caps and 
market intervention cause problems."
