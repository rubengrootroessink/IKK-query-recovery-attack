Well hey there to you!  Man, long time.  I figured you must be married with 
kids by now.

Well, I can tell you that my summer's probably a whole heckuvalot better 
since I'm not in the summer class.  I'm assuming that you're doing it in 
order to get out in 5 semesters?  I decided to do it in 6, but wil only have 
to take one class the last semester.

Been thinking about you (as I've watched my Sun stock crater).  How's it 
going?  What the heck you doing there?

I'm surprised that you've lasted that long in the South Bay.  Good luck 
looking for a place in SF----smart move.

I'm around in August and definitely up for a Happy Hour.

Don't be a Stranger, Stranger.

Best,
Jeff

Hey there!

How are you?  How's your summer? I'm nearing the end
of summer school and cannot wait til it's over. The
class has been a new low point in terms of educational
value-it sucks! ...in fact, I'm in class now. 

Work is fine-not thrilling.  Again-I'm thinking about
taking advantage of Sun's flexible work deal and
moving back up to the city. I do not like the south
bay much. 

Trying to get a happy hour together in August...are
you around?

Let me know how you are...
Courtney
