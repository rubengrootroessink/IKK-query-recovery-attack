I am meeting him in London on the 5th and we are leaving that Sunday the 8th
for Florence.  We stay in Florence (and the Tuscany area) until the 16th.
Have you been there?  Do you know anyone who would be willing to give me
some advice or ideas of a cool place to stay?

John and Kittina Powers (among others) are coming to dinner Oct 7.  Please
let me know by the time we get back (9/23) from Mexico if any or all of you
care to join us.  It is not a command performance, but you are most
welcome.  I need to know to order the foie gras - there is a shortage of it
right now - probably due to our anniversary approaching
