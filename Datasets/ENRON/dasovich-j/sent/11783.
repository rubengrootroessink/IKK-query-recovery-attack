I talked to Richard today and let him know we're not filling the position 
right away.  And we had a very good conversation about the negotiations 
underway and how we can help each other out. 

Best,
Jeff

I don't think we need a position focused solely on Sacto.

I'm assuming that we're not moving to fill the Sacramento position.  If this 
is correct, let me know and I'll get back to Costigan (who's the Assembly 
Republican leader's (i.e., David Cox's) Chief of Staff.

Best,
Jeff
