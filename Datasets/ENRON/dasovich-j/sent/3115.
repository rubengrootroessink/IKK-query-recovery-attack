		 Subject: CDWR Summary for Ken Lay

Hi Rosalee:
Attached is a summary of the proposal that ENA filed today in response to the 
RFP for power and gas issued by California's DWR.  Also attached is a copy of 
the complete proposal.  Steve Kean asked that I forward it along to you.  
Could you please print out a copy and forward it along to Ken Lay prior to 
his departure for Washington D.C.?  Thanks very much.

All the best,
Jeff
