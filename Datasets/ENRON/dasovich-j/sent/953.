Greetings:

Bowen's aide just called Mona and said that California State Senator Bowen is 
going to have a hearing on MONDAY in California as a follow-on to the FERC 
hearing that took place today.  We've been invited to attend.  Focus of 
hearing:  Repeat of today's hearing, but have it California's house, rather 
than FERC's.  Based on his Oscar-winning performance at today's hearing, 
Steve Kean's the one Bowen's office has requested.  

Possible to have a very quick call to get folks' view on the pros and cons of 
participating in the hearing---recall that Peace sits on Bowen's 
committee---and whether Steve Kean can be persuaded to come to California?  
Or perhaps we can send a video-tape of Steve to be played to the Committee?  
("You people in California are crazy, but other than that you're a swell 
group of people.") 

If possible, we would like to have the call at 10 AM (CST)/8 AM (PST).  
Please let me know if this works for folks.  And if it does work, Ginger 
could you set up a call-in number?

Best,
Jeff
