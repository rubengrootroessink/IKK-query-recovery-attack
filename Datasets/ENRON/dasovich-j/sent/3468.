Hi Laura:

Thanks very much.  If it works for you, I'd be happy to come to your office 
on either day to meet and catch up.  Just let me know.  I can be flexible.  
Have fun in DC.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff,

Thanks for all of the updates. I am off to DC with Chambers, but would like 
to have an opportunity to talk again when I return later next week. Let me 
know what times are free for you Wed. (3/7) or Thurs. (3/8).

Regards,

Laura
