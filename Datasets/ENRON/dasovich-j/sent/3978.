Based on latest info hear's latest assessment of Gov's talk:

I'm in charge.
Here's all the wonderful things I've done thus far to address the crisis 
(likely to include Edison TX talks, since it seems he has no choice but to 
continue that charade).
It's bad and getting worse and we've got to pull together as a state to get 
through it.
Rate increases are a necessary evil that---painful as they are, and they will 
be painful---must be part of the solution; and future increases may well be 
likely.
Blame FERC and the generators, because it's their fault.
Windfall profits is a good idea.


Kari Dohn of the Gov's office  and I have been trading voicemails.  She's 
going to LA with Governor Backbone later this afternoon for the speech.  If 
she and I hook up, I'll report back on what, if anything, I hear.

Best,
Jeff
