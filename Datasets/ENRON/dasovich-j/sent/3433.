Christian:

Could you let me know as soon as possible if 1) the proposed decision that I 
faxed you yesterday is go to go, i.e., adequately addresses our concerns 
regarding creditworthiness or if 2) we want to recommend some additional 
provisions?  If we want to recommend additional provisions, could you let me 
know what those are?  I want to make a run at getting this deal done at the 
CPUC ASAP,and would like to push Peevey to get Davis to have the PUC pass it 
out at their next meeting. But need to know if it's good as is or needs some 
tweeking.  Thanks very much.

Best,
Jeff
