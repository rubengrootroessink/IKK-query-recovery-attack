Hi Anita:
Thanks again for you help with the questions I had about the deals going on 
California.  I'd like to follow-up with you and Steve, particularly regarding 
the "not a telecom" aspect of the deal.  These deals are going to 
accelerate--very confidentially, they are directly linked to getting the 
universe connected to Enron On-line, our very successful B2B website.  I'd 
like to discuss with you two as soon as possible.  Could you let me know when 
a convenient time is?  Thanks a million.

Best,
Jeff
