Can't thank you enough for your help and for comments.  I'm going to continue 
to work on it.  Have another data question.  Can we determine big high tech's 
electricity bill was in California and nationally last year?  Thanks again.

Best,
Jeff

Hi Jeff,  Great  organization  and  great  stuff here... Three  comments  on  
the   message  you  have  prepared. 

 All  US   Hi  tech is   8 percent of  the US   GNP-- not just   
California's  hi  tech  share... ( which  I think  is how  it  now  
reads.....)

I would  add under " Last Century Infrastructure "    that  Calif. only  
added    670 MW  in the past  5 years  when it  needed
5500 MW--  it  needed   8   times  more  than  was  actually  built  but 
could not  get  built  due to   siting   restrictions...

On last  Slide   last  line  Small  typo     reads "  a....a...." 

Great job..   Margaret..
