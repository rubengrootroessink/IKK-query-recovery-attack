Merry Christmas to all!

Thanks to Jeff for picking the names.
The list is below; buyer on the left, recipient is on the right. Now our 
shopping can begin....

Mom     buys for        Debbie
Jeff                           Mike
Prentice                    Steve
Robert                      Charry
Dad                          Nancy
Steve                        Robert
Nancy                       Jeff
Charry                       Prentice
Mike                         Mom
Debbie                      Dad

Jeff, please forward this to Prentice.  I will call Mom and Dad.  

Finally, Mike and I are hosting Christmas Day at our house with a big assist 
from Jeff on the dinner preparation.  I will probably do it the same way we 
do Thanksgiving at Steve and Charry's by asking each of you to bring/make 
something.  We are looking forward to having you all here.

Debbie
