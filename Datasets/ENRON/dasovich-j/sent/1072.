No, you're correct.  In the spreadsheet, there were three sorts of "items":  
discontinued ops, unusual items, extraordinary items, and accounting 
changes.  The sale of the assets came about in the attempt to "trim the fat" 
(or manage earnings, you make the call).  Here's the line item from my 
spreadsheet:



It came right after the entries for the "unusual loss from the government 
ban."  I included it with the "unusual" items (right after discontinued ops 
and right before extraordinary items.  Big question is, is it included 
already.  I assumed not, since (though it's confusing), the problem makes is 
sound like none of the additional "agenda items" were accounted for.  I don't 
think it's a huge deal, though.  The questions left a lot of room for 
ambiguity.

Best,
Jeff

Maybe I am confused.  I thought that the sale of the assets was separate 
from the discontinued operations of the Feed division.  Unfortuneatly I do 
not have my book here to check.
