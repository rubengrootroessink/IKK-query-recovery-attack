Let's try this.  Neither of us will say one critical thing of the other.  I 
won't say anything, in jest, or otherwise, and you do the same.  And if 
someone does, the other needs to bring it up. But Prentice, if I say, "that's 
critical" and then I have to have a long argument about the fact that I think 
it is, and you think it isn't, that isn't going to work.  So I'm willing to 
have a complete moratorium, if that's something that you're willing to try, 
too.

I hope you'll going sailing today.  Did I leave my sunglasses in your car?  I 
also left my gym bag in your bathroom, which has my sailing shoes in it.  I'm 
at work.  You can call me here.

Jeff, I love you, but I'm unhappy.  I just don't want to be criticized
anymore.  The thing is, I know you think a lot of it is funny, and I've just
lost my sense of humor, but the truth is, after a while, it's just not funny
anymore.  Like when you yawned last night when I was telling a story to your
friends.  Yes, it's funny.  But when you do it every time, after a while, it
just starts to hurt my feelings.  That's just one recent example.  You're
often telling everybody how neurotic and fucked up I am.  Or how I'm totally
overbearing about playing the banjo.  In fact, you just said that today to
my friends at Haas.  Do you know how embarassing that was for me?  You
should listen to yourself when you talk about me in front of your friends or
my friends or my family.  How often do you say nice things and how often do
you criticize me?  Why don't you ask them and see what they have to say.
I've tried to talk to you about it.  I asked you to spend some time trying
to say mostly nice things, just for a little while.  But apparantly, you
either can't or won't, and the end result is that I feel like you just don't
care.  I'm sure there are things you want me to do.  I'd like to try to do
them.  But I don't know what else I can do to make you understand that I
just can't take all the criticism from you anymore.  It makes me feel like
shit.  I don't know where else to go, Jeff.  I suggested talking to a
shrink, but you're not willing to do that either.  I'm sure that half of it
is my fault, and I'd like to work on this together, but you don't seem to be
willing to work on the one thing that's really hurting me and that I've
asked you to work on.  And maybe that means you need to think about how you
really feel.
