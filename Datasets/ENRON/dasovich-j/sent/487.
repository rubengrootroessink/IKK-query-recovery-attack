The meeting between Skilling & the Governor went well.  He's intrigued about 
the notion of doing an auction for power over the internet.  Governor and his 
folks are going to do some internal work this week and there's going to be 
another call next Monday.  Will fill you in as things progress.  Thanks again 
for the pricing sheet.  Please keep all of this highly confidential.

Best,
Jeff
