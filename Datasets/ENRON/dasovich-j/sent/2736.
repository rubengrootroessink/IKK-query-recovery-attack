Subject: A.00-11-038, SCE's Amended Rate Stabilization Plan Application



Attached is Southern California Edison Company's (U 338-E) Amended Rate
Stabilization Plan Application in the above-referenced proceeding, along
with a revised Exhibit SCE-1, the Rate Stabilization Plan testimony.  An
electronic copy of revised Exhibit SCE-2, the End of Rate Freeze Tariffs,
is not available and is being served via US mail.  Versions of the amended
application and Exhibit SCE-1 showing revision marks are also available
upon request.


SCE attempted to file this amended application with the Commission today,
but the docket office would not accept it for filing because it was nearly
closing time.  SCE is serving the documents today as provided in the
Certificate of Service and will file it with the Commission when the
Commission's Los Angeles office opens at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.
