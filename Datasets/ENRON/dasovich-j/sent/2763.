Thanks.  Good points.  Will make sure that we have "bad guys" issued 
covered.  You have a great holiday with your family and a safe and happy New 
Year.  

Best,
Jeff

Jeff --

Your notes look great.  Best of luck today with the Hearings.  Only items not 
included would be (1) information from the PX / ISO and (2) governance at the 
PX / ISO.  I don't think these will are appropriate at these hearings.

Finally, I think that if the Hearings begin to devolve into a "who are the 
bad guys", what  are you proposing Mike Day respond?  Do we have any messages 
for this situation (however unlikely)?

Jim

You're right, Sue.  Rates can't go up w/out declaring the rate freeze over in 
some fashion---trying to finesse it.  Thanks very much for the comments.  
Harry also had a good comment---don't specify the amount of rate increase in 
our comments; rather note that the rate increase needs to be well-reasoned 
and based on facts and evidence.  Will make that change.

Jeff,

This looks good.  It comes across as moderate in tone-- although probably no 
one else will ask to leave the rate freeze in place. 

I have a legal question -- Under AB 1890, I don't see anyway that the CPUC 
can raise rates without ending the rate freeze first.  Am I missing 
something? So, how is it clear that the CCPUC can raise the rates on Feb 1?  
It's clear,however,  that once the retained assets are valued that the rates 
can be changed.
