Interesting points.  However, I don't ever recall you agreeing with every 
Commission decision on disallowances.  And I know you wouldn't establish 
differing standards for IOUs and state water agencies.  

I just hope that this isn't the tip of the iceberg.  

You really think that Campbell is a dim bulb?  A Republican, yes, but I 
haven't heard anyone else describe him as a dim bulb.

Best,
Jeff

Shame on you, Jeff!  I expect this sort of thing from inexperienced 
reporters and dim bulbs like Campbell.  But you KNOW that this sort of 
thing is no big deal.  And when did the PUC ever disallow these kinds of 
losses for the utilities?  I don't think my memory has gotten that bad.   MIKE
