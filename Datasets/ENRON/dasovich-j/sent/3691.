FYI.  There is a great catalogue of the legislation currently pending 
attached as an appendix to the leg analyst report that I distributed 
yesterday.

Best,
Jeff

Everyone, 

Just to clarify Miyung's message, I want Houston to be kept abreast of the 
key pieces of legislation that Sacto is working on, offering amendements etc. 
John Neslage provided us with a list but I want to be sure that it hasn't 
changed at all.  Please review what Miyung sent you and foward to her any 
comments/updates.  

thanks

Janel has asked me to monitor Assembly/Senate bill activities, and I need to 
confirm that I have a complete list of all of the bills that Enron is 
involved with.

Below is the a list of the bills that I am aware of.  Could you review the 
following list and confirm that my list is complete.  Please respond by 
Friday, March 16th.  I would like to begin working on this project as soon as 
possible.

Thank you for your assistance.
