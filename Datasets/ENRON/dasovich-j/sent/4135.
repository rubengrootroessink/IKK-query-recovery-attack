We have agreed on a strategy, subject to Whaley/Delaney approval, to:
Scott Stoness submit testimony today advocating 2 part real time pricing in CA
Read other parties testimony this weekend from the perspective "Has somebody 
filed testimony close enough to Stoness testimony, that we can cross examine 
and brief to a favorable outcome?"
Meet on Monday at 8AM to decide whether to rescind Stoness's testimony.

The following dial in number and code corresponds to the Monday 8AM Central 
Time meeting.

possible.
Harry and Jeane polish Stoness testimony and wait to the last minute before 
submitting it
