Can the deal bench presentation be distributed publicly?  I'd like to use it 
in the "subcommittee" meetings I mentioned last week as a means to a solution 
for California's reasonableness review morass.

Left a message with Kahn late last evening.  Haven't heard back yet.  Will 
let you know.

Best,
Jeff
