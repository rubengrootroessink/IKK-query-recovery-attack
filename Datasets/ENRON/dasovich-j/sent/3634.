FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
03/13/2001 8:00 AM=20

CALIFORNIA RECEIVES FIRST=20
PEAKER POWER PLANT PROPOSALS
SACRAMENTO=20
Governor Gray Davis announced that the first two proposals for power plants=
=20
to provide electricity at peak use times this summer have been received by=
=20
the California Energy Commission.
"We are doing everything we can to greatly streamline the time it takes to=
=20
get new generation up and running this summer," Governor Davis said. "These=
=20
new peaker proposals are examples of our determination to meet California's=
=20
energy challenge."
A 90-megawatt plant called the Larkspur Energy Facility would be located in=
=20
the Otay Mesa area of the City of San Diego, at the corner of Harvest Road=
=20
and Otay Mesa Road.=20
The second proposal is for the Indigo Energy Facility, a 135-megawatt plant=
=20
that would be located near an existing wind generating facility in the City=
=20
of Palm Springs in Riverside County. The project is north of Interstate 10,=
=20
on 19th Avenue, east of North Indian Avenue.=20
Both projects use natural gas-fueled simple-cycle turbine generators equipp=
ed=20
with state of the art air pollution control features. They are being propos=
ed=20
by Wildflower Energy LP, a Houston, Texas-based company. The two projects a=
re=20
part of the Independent System Operator's reliability generation agreements=
=20
planned to come on-line this summer.
On February 8, 2001, Governor Davis directed the Energy Commission to use i=
ts=20
emergency power plant permitting authority to permit new peaking and=20
renewable power plants that can be on-line by July 31, 2001. The emergency=
=20
permitting authority extended to peaker projects that have ISO contracts an=
d=20
have not begun the licensing process with the local jurisdictions. Peaker=
=20
power plants are simple cycle generators that can be constructed in a=20
relatively small area and can readily connect to the existing electricity=
=20
transmission and natural gas system.=20
The Energy Commission review of the proposed projects will include site tou=
rs=20
and informational hearings in both local areas. Both applications are=20
currently under review by Energy Commission staff for data adequacy. Once=
=20
they are accepted as data adequate, the Energy Commission plans to expedite=
=20
the licensing process under its emergency process to approve projects in as=
=20
soon as 21 days.=20
Provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act do not apply to=20
emergency power plant projects.
