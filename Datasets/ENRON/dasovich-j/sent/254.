The CPUC can do it it it wants---it's a decision about risk and reward.  If 
the CPUC wants to set up a mechanism by which pre-approval is permitted, it 
can do so.  Here's the catch, pre-approval means that the IOU has to be 
willing (generally) to accept a bit more risk.  They don't like that.  The 
CPUC has to be willing to relinquish a bit of control---this Commission 
definitely doesn't like that idea.  So often, the utility puts up a proposal 
that the Commission says places to much risk with granny.  The CPUC often 
issues a decision in response that the utility claims leaves to much control 
(read "second-guessing") with the Commission (and therefore leaves to much 
risk with the utility).  In the end, the utility often "declines" the 
Commission's offer.  However, it can be done.  For example, under 
California's restructuring law, the utility's purchases from the PX are just 
and reasonable, period.   (Of course, we see where the incentive built into 
that mechanism got us--a debacle.)  

Do you have PG&E's and Edison's proposals filed regarding bilaterals some 
weeks ago, in which they propose certain pre-approval mechanisms?  The 
Commission didn't adopt them wholesale, and the decision has made PG&E and 
Edison reticent to sign any such as a result---witness the unfruitful RFPs.

This at all helpful?
