Got a call from Rick.  Scheduling issues now make it necessary to have the 
meeting in San Francisco on Dec. 5th at 9 AM.  Rick asked that folks make the 
meeting a priority.

Best,
Jeff

Hedy is out of town until the 27th.  I can't confirm anything yet, but the 
30th looks better.  I can give ger a call
tomorrow, but may not be able to confirm until she returns.
