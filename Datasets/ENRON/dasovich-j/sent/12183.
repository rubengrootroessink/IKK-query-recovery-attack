Hi.

Please book me SF/NYC round trip,leaving Tues 8.2.01 at 9:15 am, returning on 
sunday taking the 4:15 pm from NYC.  Also please book me an additional ticket 
on the same flight using MY mileage plus miles (number is 369 321 854).

Please book me at the Waldorf (midtown, like 50-ish and Lexington?), because 
we have an Enron ($280) rate there.  Please book it for 3 
nights--thurs/fri/sat.  Thanks a million.

Best,
Jeff
