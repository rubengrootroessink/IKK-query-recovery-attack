Hi:
Hope you're well.  Based on your note, I faxed my Direct Deposit change to 
Renee Kelso a week or so ago and wanted to check with her to see that she'd 
received it and that it was in process, but I can't find her name in email.  
Any suggestions on how I can check in and see how progress is going?  As 
always, thanks a bunch.

Best,
Jeff
