The interim settlement never got voted out.  Therefore it ain't official, so 
there's no requirement yet to refile anything.  (Welcome to California.)  In 
fact, folks are still trying to get the Commission to reject the IS and 
approve the one that we worked on (though the chances of that are not huge, 
at this point).  Give a holler if there's anything else.

Best,
Jeff

In Commissioner Bilas' draft Final Opinion of the IS (page 51), Socal was 
ordered to withdraw advice letter 2837 a file a new advise letter to 
implement a revised physical receipt point allocation system.  Was that ever 
filed and, if so, can you please send a copy?

Regards,

Stephanie
