Hi.  I was trying to get a fix on whether there's something going on on the 
Friday of your Dad's b-day to see if I need to cancel the Houston trip.  What 
do you think?

It is going to be pretty casual on Friday!  Sausages, polenta, and salad type 
- around the kitchen table - we are pretending his birthday is the next day.  
However, your presence would indeed make it more festive and birthday 
celebrationy!!

Eldon said that you were making dinner on Friday, the 9th, and that he was 
flying a plane to pick up Cameron and Rory in Carmel.  Have you guys spoken 
in the last few months!?!?!?  (kidding.)  And don't worry about my 
birthday--that's not the issue.  It's Eldon's 80th--that's huge.  Friday is 
the 9th.  So I'm just checking in to see what's up.  My very strong 
inclination--for a variety of reasons, but Eldon's b-day is the biggest 
one--is to cancel. 
Signed, 
confused

I'm not sure what Friday will bring - the party as you know (for you and 
Eldon as far as I am concerned) is on Saturday - however, none of your 
friends will be there except us!  When would you normally get back?

har-dee-har-har.  I mean, will we be celebrating in some fashion.  I'm 
scheduled to go to Houston--I'm not kidding--but if there's something 
planned, which I assume there is, then I'm going to cancel my trip to 
Houston, like pronto. 

Ironically, 
Jeff

You are so sweet.  Thanks so much.  What's new?  What are we doing on the 
Friday of Eldon's b-day?

Nancy, sorry this took a while, but it will be worth it.  If anybody knows 
about the Sonoma Coast, it's this guy.  He's done work with Flowers, 
Kistler, etc. out there.  His name is Greg Bjornstad (sp.?) and his number 
is (707) 829-1687.  He doesn't really know me from a hole in the ground but 

you can "double reference" my name as Todd Graff's friend.  Todd is the 
winemaker at Sonoma Creek and is a good friend of mine who worked with Eric 

on some projects.
