Dad/Eldon is going to get some Acacia Chardonnay for $5 per bottle.  We had 
some at Hopkins last night and it was really very good.  It is unlabeled but 
it is Acacia chard.  I know you don't drink a lot of white wine - but you 
might want some around.  Let us know - he needs to order it before he goes 
and he is going to try to go tomorrow.
Cameron - I need a few days to make any arrangements you want me to do in 
Italy - so please let me know.  
I will be out of the office the rest of the day.  Home around 6 or 7.
