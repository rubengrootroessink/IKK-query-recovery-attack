Hi Dana:

Please accept my apologies for not having responded sooner.  Things, as you 
know, are, well, a little nuts.  It was great to meet you and I would be 
happy to discuss opportunities.  I need to be in S.D. in the next few weeks.  
Perhaps we could have lunch, or something, and you could fill me in on what 
you folks do.

Best,
Jeff

Hi, Jeff --

It was great to meet you this week while you were in San Diego for the
hearings.  Cathy Van Way and I had a blast catching up on old times and
trying to think of every pun possible that led directly back to electricity.

I know Enron has extensive communications support, but in the future if you
have need on a project or public relations campaign, I hope you'll keep me
in mind.  Although it took me a while to understand the difference between
a megawatt and a megaphone before Rep. Schaefer introduced the first bill,
once I finally "got it" I developed an ability to help the media understand
the issue -- so that misinformation, as experienced in San Diego -- can be
avoided.   I've also maintained excellent contacts with the media covering
electricity and can help with corporate pr as well as issue communications.

As you're well aware, the light won't go out on this issue for a long time
(pun practice).

Best regards,

Dana
