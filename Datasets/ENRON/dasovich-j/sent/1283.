Folks:

As you recall from out meeting on Tuesday, we decided that I'd pull together 
a brief description of our key priorities and the actions underway to achieve 
them.  The status report will be updated weekly.  We'll use the weekly update 
as an important internal communication tool to keep folks abreast of 
activities and developments in CA.  It will also serve as a a tool to help 
identify the need to modify our priorities and/or actions in light of 
ever-changing circumstances.   

We were going to try to get the first report out this week, but with the 
meeting in Houston, Sue's doctor appt and Karen's meetings with Marathon, 
we'll get the first one out Monday.

My notes suggest that (today's) key priorities---understanding that 
everything's subject to change on a daily basis---are: 
1. ENA
No refunds
End wholesale price caps as soon as possible
Get forward markets working in CA
Expedite plant siting

2. EES
No early roll of/maintain the rate freeze (till ~01/02)
Maintain current PX credit framework (till ~01/02)

Please forward to me the actions underway and planned in the area for which 
you've been designated "lead."  Given how fluid things are, It seems prudent 
to limit "planned" items to those we've got planned for the next 2-4 weeks.  

I'll compile for distribution by COB Monday.    My notes show the following 
leads:

Legislative--Sandi
PR--Karen
FERC-Sue
PUC--Jeff/Sue
Miscellaneous (e.g., AB 1890 "subcommittee)--Jeff

Also please let me know if my notes w.r.t. leads is consistent with yours.

Thanks very much and have a great weekend.

Best,
Jeff
