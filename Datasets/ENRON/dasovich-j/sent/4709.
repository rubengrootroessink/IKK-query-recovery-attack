Greetings Hap:
Hope all's well and Edison's paying you.  

Please be absolutely sure in the future to email or phone me with a head's up 
on filings like these in California prior to filing.

As you know, it's crazy in California, with a lot flying around in numerous 
forums.  Even Ken Lay's frequently been to California over the past couple of 
months trying to educate and advocate rational, detailed solutions.  Want to 
make absolutely sure that we don't step on each other in our many attempts to 
get this ridiculous state back on track.

Not trying to slow you down, or dictate content; rather, given the 
high-stakes nature of the California situation, coordination is critical.  
Thanks much.

Best,
Jeff
