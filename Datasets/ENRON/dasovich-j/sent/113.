All is well here.  It did take me awhile to recover....but am feeling great 
now and looking forward to a few days off next week.  We had a meeting in 
Houston that got cancelled, so I decided to take vacation.

I'm sorry that you didn't make it to LA for the convention.  We had some fun, 
and it would have been great to see you.  Are you going to be in D.C. on the 
13th?  I have to be in Chicago for meetings on the 12th and don't get into 
D.C. until late.

See you soon.

Man, Illinois is tough.  One has to submit testimony to get certified!  How 
are things going?  Got your voice mail.  Hope all's well.  Recovered yet from 
the conventions?
