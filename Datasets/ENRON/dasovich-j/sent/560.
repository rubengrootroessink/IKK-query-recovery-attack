Just spent about 90 minutes with Rebecca.  She left with a very good 
understanding of our view of the problem and the solutions.  She also spent 
time asking me how I thought other players would respond to the IOU request 
for a big check to cover the undercollections.  

She expects to have a "big picture" story--covering AB 1890s past, present & 
future--completed in the next couple of weeks.  In Rebecca's words, she wants 
the story to "shake things up."  She's very upset with how the utilities are 
handling it.  I told her we were less concerned with "he said/she said" and 
more concerned with finding real short and long term solutions that are fair 
to everyone.

Mark and Karen:  In my long history with Rebecca, it has always been 
understood that our conversations are off the record and background.  
Invariably, at the end of the conversation, Rebecca tells me that she intends 
to call later and cajole the daylights out of me in an attempt to use some of 
my more colorful quotes.  It was no different this time.

If anyone wants more details, just let me know.

Best,
Jeff
