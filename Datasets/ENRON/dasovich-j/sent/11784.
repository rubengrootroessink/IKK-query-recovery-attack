FYI.  Hit the wires almost immediately.  He handled it with great aplomb and 
delivered a very good speech.   He had the crowd (but for the pie throwin' 
types) squarely on his side.

Best,
Jeff

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - A Texas energy executive got more than boos and jeers 
before starting a speech on California's energy crisis, he got a pie in the 
face. 
Jeffrey Skilling, chief executive of Houston-based Enron Corp., was nailed 
with a pie by a protester at the beginning of his speech at the Commonwealth 
Club of California.

Enron has come under fire after accusations from Gov. Gray Davis and state 
officials that it and other energy companies forced electricity prices 
skyward by holding back supply. 
Enron has denied such claims, and joined other power producers in arguing 
that the state and utilities owes them billions in unpaid bills. 
Davis acknowledged that Pacific Gas & Electric Co., which has declared 
bankruptcy, and Southern California Edison together still owe generators such 
as Enron, Duke Energy, Mirant and Reliant Energy about $2.5 billion for past 
electricity sales. 
State officials countered that wholesalers charged as much as $9 billion in 
illegal overcharges dating back to May 2000. The feuding groups are to meet 
in a single room next week under a federal order to try and work out 
agreements that could determine how billions of dollars will be divided.
