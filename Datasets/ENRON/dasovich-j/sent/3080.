On Friday, I attended a meeting with Ken Lay and Karen Denne that Mike Peev=
ey=20
and David Freeman requested.  Mike Peevey was President of Southern=20
California Edison before founding NEV (which he eventually sold to AES). =
=20
Freeman is General Manager of LADWP. =20

The Governor hired Peevey to be his chief energy advisor.  Freeman is the=
=20
Governor=01,s chief negotiator responsible for signing power contracts on b=
ehalf=20
of DWR now that the Legislature has passed AB1X and the Governor has signed=
=20
it.  John Burton, the leader of the State Senate, is responsible for gettin=
g=20
the Freeman the job of chief negotiator, but Peevey was clearly in charge. =
=20

Also at the meeting was Vikram Budraja, former SVP of power systems and=20
planning for Edison.  He=01,s now a private consultant that Freeman hired t=
o=20
help him with the contract negotiations.

Peevey asked for the meeting to urge Enron to respond to DWR=01,s RFP issue=
d on=20
Friday.  Peevey/Freeman want to announce a package of deals on Tuesday.  Th=
ey=20
implied that they=01,ve already got some deals done and expect to have 8+ d=
eals=20
to announce on Tuesday, though they gave no details other than to say that=
=20
they=01,ve got a deal with Calpine (as reported in the press).  Their plan =
is to=20
announce on Tuesday the names of the suppliers they=01,ve signed with, the =
total=20
number of megawatts signed, and the average price per MW.  They are concern=
ed=20
that the media will want them to make public the details of each individual=
=20
deal, which for obvious reasons they don=01,t want to do.

Peevey and Freeman also said that they don=01,t want to sign too many long-=
term=20
contracts though they recognize that there=01,s a trade-off between term an=
d=20
price.

Ken Lay told them that Enron would respond.  ENA is preparing a response.  =
He=20
also told them that EES was working on a plan to reduce demand at our=20
customers=01, facilities and that the plan would be completed and ready for=
=20
implementation very soon.

I=01,ve summarized the points that Ken Lay made and the responses from Peev=
ey=20
and Freeman:

It would be difficult to enter into contracts without some assurance that D=
WR=20
is creditworthy.

Response from Peevey/Freeman:
AB1X provides DWR the funds necessary=01*beginning on Friday, Feb 1st=01*to=
=20
purchase the power necessary to fill the utilities=01, short position.  Ken=
 Lay=20
pressed them on this point and Peevey insisted that AB1X provides the funds=
=20
needed to pay suppliers.

The RFP should give suppliers maximum flexibility in coming up with proposa=
ls.

Response from Peevey/Freeman:
Be as creative as possible.  All offers will be considered (despite the=20
language contained in the RFP).

The only customers who have been protected from California=01,s failed=20
restructuring law are customers who chose another provider under Direct=20
Access.  In addition, one of the quickest ways to help solve California=01,=
s=20
shortage is to work with customers to reduce demand and develop on-site=20
generation.  Taking away Direct Access and access to customers generally=01=
*as=20
AB1X does=01*is therefore a dumb idea and must be reversed.

Response from Peevey:
He agreed but said that it was impossible to remove it from the bill.  He=
=20
affirmed what we already know=01*that the head of the Senate oversight comm=
ittee=01*
Debra Bowen=01*is working on a =01&clean-up=018 bill to remove the prohibit=
ion.  In=20
response to Ken Lay=01,s points that California needed to make sure that ut=
ility=20
interconnection and stand-by rates didn=01,t continue to impede on-site=20
generation, Peevey and Freeman said that the Governor understood the proble=
m=20
and was prepared to fix it.

Siting laws have got to be streamlined and California (i.e., the Governor)=
=20
has got to credibly commit to the swift development of new power plants in=
=20
order to push the forward curve down.

Response from Peevey/Freeman:
The Governor is scheduled to offer a plan this week that is targeted at=20
expediting siting and development.

DWR should accept demand reduction bids at the same time that it accepts=20
supply-side bids.

Response from Peevey/Freeman:
They agreed but said that there is extreme political pressure to announce t=
he=20
signing of some supply deals on Tuesday in order to prove to legislators th=
at=20
DWR will be able to keep the lights on, and at a =01&reasonable=018 price. =
 They=20
also need to sign some deals in light of the fact that the feds are very=20
unlikely to extend the DOE order forcing suppliers to sell to the IOUs.  On=
ce=20
they=01,ve shown that they can manage the supply side, Peevey and Freeman s=
aid=20
they want to quickly turn their attention to demand-side bidding.

These are the highlights.  I=01,d be happy to give more details on the Mond=
ay=20
morning \call.

Best,
Jeff
