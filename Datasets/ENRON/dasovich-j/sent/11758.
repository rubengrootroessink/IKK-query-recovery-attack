Coulda sworn I mentioned DB when we had dinner with your guy at Bizou.

Let's talk more to discuss the latest developments.  Glad to hear that it's 
still moving along. I'm in town tonite.  

You MUST keep this strictly confidential----I've know Colleen for years.  
She's a sweet dear friend of mine.  But she's driving me fucking crazy.  I am 
very happy that you two are buddies and having fun together and that she's 
being such a big help with your wedding.  But it's going to be best for you 
and me and Colleen and Scott and Tony Blair and Oprah Winfrey and Sammy Soza, 
and everyone else, if my contact with the wonderful Ms Silva is minimized in 
the immediate future.  Don't worry about it.  No big deal. Just want and need 
you to know.  And please keep it very confidential.  Thanks.

Best,
Jeff

OK, it looks like DealBench has hit our radar screen hard here.  Can you
help me get a meeting set up with the right people??

Look like the strat sourcing group in Houston is requesting a "sand box" to
play in to test out our product.  Did you ever get a chance to put in a good
word there?

David Hoffman wrote me and said he really enjoyed spending time with you and
said you were such a smart and thoughtful guy.  Thought you might like the
compliment.  I am going to check out his house as a wedding site on Thursday
with Colleen and then go have dinner with Lisanne.  Any chance you guys want
to come along?

Write back soon...

Cameron (cc: Ian),

See my response below to the email from David Hurwitz today regarding
DealBench.
My contact at DealBench is:
Suresh Raghavan, Principal (also Director of Enron Net Works)
713-853-4217
suresh.raghavan@dealbench.com
I'll leave DealBench in your hands, but please keep me advised as it relates
to Enron.  Let me know if I can be of any help.  
Thanks,
David

FYI: Just got a direct mail piece from DealBench, LLC, a wholly owned
Enron company.  They are selling themselves as a complete RFP and
auction system.

David H,
Here's a wrapup of my meeting with DealBench two weeks ago.  I left a
voicemail for Cameron yesterday asking her how to proceed with them, as this
would become a BizDev deal with a perceived competitor.
On another note, the 2 EES Proc Mgrs that Jim F and I met with a couple of
weeks ago, mentioned that they have an initiative on the table to run a
reverse auction by July 15, and that they are considering BayBuilder.  They
said they don't care about the DealBench platform, it doesn't meet their
needs and DealBench isn't giving any better deal to Enron's business units
than they would to anyone else off the street.
Ian and I are trying to schedule a meeting next Tuesday with Proc Mgrs from
several business units along with John Gillespie from GSS in order to demo
Perfect Insight and discuss our Early Adopter Program.

Met for 45 min w Suresh Raghavan to discuss DealBench (Enron's proprietary
auction platform) and the potential for Perfect to provide complementary
solutions to their customers through EnronOnline and beyond.  We agreed that
the purpose of our discussions would not be to have him sponsor us to the
Global Strategic Sourcing unit, but only to consider Perfect as a bus dev
deal.  We would need to price ourselves as an ASP for them, but with the
liquidity they have (supposedly like $1B per day traded through
EnronOnline), this should be a no-brainer.
Suresh is the Principal of DealBench, as well as a Director of Enron Net
Works.  DealBench is one of many business units under the Enron Wholesale
Services / Enron Net Works group, including EnronOnline, ClickPaper,
MetalMarkets, and other wholesale marketplace services.  DealBench has 3
primary offerings:
* Auctioning/RFQ management
* Deal Rooms with complex negotiations tools
* Data Rooms  for sharing of secure documents such as CADs, blue prints, etc
for M&A due diligence.

We discussed the basic functionality and sophisticated math behind Perfect,
and he felt that it was worth considering further as a complementary service
offering for the DealBench platform.  He would like to arrange a demo for
him and some of his managers for the end of June or early July.
