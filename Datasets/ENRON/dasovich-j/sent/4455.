Agreed.  Great idea on characterizing it as a "melding."  Need to fill you in 
on the "investigation" discussions with the Republicans in today's meeting 
with Lay.  You still around?

Best,
Jeff

Looks good.  I wouldn't stress the MOU, but would rather focus on the 
"melding" of alot of good ideas.  The Investigation concession comes from 
whom?

Basics of Proposal
Something akin to the MOU (that adequately addresses the solvency issue, for 
the IOUs, the State and QFs), but WITHOUT the transmission component
Direct Access for ALL customers, transitioning to a core/noncore market 
structure in 18-24 months (this can be accomplished without stranding CDWR's 
contracts)
Concessions
 -IOUs (MOU modifications)
 -Generators (past due amounts)
 -investigations
Package to finance the deal (bond issuance backed by rate increases to permit 
securitization)

Message
This is the last best chance to achieve a comprehensive settlement
We have developed a comprehensive solution and are meeting with everyone that 
will see us.
We have thus far received positive feedback on and a willingness to work with 
our proposal
We intend to work tirelelessly to gain support for a total solution---it's 
vital, and time's running out
