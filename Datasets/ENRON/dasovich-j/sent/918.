Hi.  Sorry for the delay.  Today's big FERC hearing has had me wrapped up.  
Please read the following and keep VERY confidential---it's an internal PG&E 
summary.  Electronic version of OII to follow.

Best,
Jeff

Yesterday, the Commission issued an OII to determine the
> adequacy of Sempra Energy's, SoCalGas' and SDG&E's gas transmission
> practices and to determine what measures need to be taken to correct any
> deficiencies.  The OII orders the Sempra affiliates and parent to
> demonstrate that SDG&E's gas supply and transmission system are adequate
> to provide service to present and future core and noncore customers.

>       As you may recall, the OII sprang from an AL that SDG&E
> filed in August requesting emergency review and approval of its proposals
> to temporarily revise gas transportation service elections to its noncore
> customers.  SDG&E subsequently pulled the advice letter after the
> Commission issued a resolution rejecting it and outlined an OII it was
> going to issue on this matter.  The language in the OII that was issued
> yesterday is substantially similar to that which was in the Commission's
> original draft resolution.

The proceeding is I0011002; I think the order was issued Nov. 2.

Jeff, I read in Gas Daily that the Cal PUC has issued an OII on the adequacy 
of supply and pipeline infrastructure in southern California.  Could you have 
someone send me a copy of the order whenever it is issued?  Steve thinks it's 
something we might want to get involved in, but I need to know more.  

Great to see you last week.

Ciao,
Susan
