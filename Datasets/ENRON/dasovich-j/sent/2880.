Thanks, Ginger.  I'll be on the call.  

Rick, if your schedule permits, could you participate in the first five-ten 
minutes of the daily EES call (10 AM CST) to give those folks a brief 
snapshot of what happened?  If so the call-in number is 800.713.8600, code = 
80435#.  

Alternatively, since I'll be on the call anyway, you can leave me a 
voicemail, or call me at 707.884.4608, and I can relay those points that you 
feel are most important to communicate.

Best,
Jeff
