Yes, they will have to file with the PUC.

Jeff:
As you may be aware SoCal Edison has announced their intention to sell their 
interest in the Mohave Generating Station to AES. Would you know if SCE has 
to file for approval of this transaction with the CPUC? I looked on the CPUC 
website but couldn't find a docket/proceeding number. As the operator of the 
Black Mesa slurry line we have a vested interest in this and I may want to 
file as an interested party in the CPUC proceeding. Thanks.
Fred
