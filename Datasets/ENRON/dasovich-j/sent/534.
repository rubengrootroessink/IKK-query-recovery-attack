Rebecca Smith called.  She wants to have coffee on Monday at 10 AM 
California.  Topics:  1) How California got here.  2) How California can get 
out of it.  

Any chance of talking Monday AM prior to 10 AM California time?  I think I've 
got the messages pretty well down, but might be useful to touch base.  Let me 
know.

Hear's a message I'm practicing:

"Shapiro and Steffes went to FERC on Friday----problem solved."

Best,
Jeff
