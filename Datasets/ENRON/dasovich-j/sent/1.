Will we be covering this?  The utilities in California have been heavily 
engaged in maintaining "fortress monopoly" at home while advocating 
"openness" abroad.  Any info showing the discrepancy is useful.  No big 
deal.  Just curious.  And if someone does, a very brief update would be 
greatly appreciated.  Best, Jeff
