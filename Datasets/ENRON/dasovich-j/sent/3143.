hi jean:  incidentally, you're coverage of the mess via email, etc. has been 
unequaled.  can't thank you enough.  were there any materials giving more 
specifics of what the governor proposed today?

thanks very much.

Best,
Jeff

Governor Davis held a press conference earlier today at the Calpine Sutter
Power Plant project where he unveiled his plan to increase generating
capacity by boosting output at existing power facilities, accelerating power
plant construction, streamlining the review process for new facilities, and
providing incentives for distributed and renewable generation.

In addition, Governor Davis appointed Larry Hamlin of Fountain Valley as
California's energy construction czar. Mr. Hamlin is on a leave of absence
from Southern California Edison where he serves as Vice President of Power
Production and Operations and Maintenance Services.

IEP is releasing a statement in response which I will forward shortly.

Thanks,
Jean
