Jeff-
I think their predictions are correct about members getting active -- though
next week is mostly ceremonious I do expect there to be many bills
introduced on the subject. I agree that the agenda looks ambitious but our
hope is directly in line with yours -- the material is background for what I
hope is lively and productive discussion. Glad you can make it. See you
there!

Delaney

Thanks, Delaney.  See you on Friday.

Quick comment:  Though just about everything's uncertain these days, folks
seem to think that Legislators are likely to get very active just as soon
as they arrive in Sacramento (next week?).  Seems that a key--if not
dominant--part of the agenda ought to be how this group can (quickly) come
to agreement on a comprehensive solution that it can offer to the
Legislature and the Governor as a pragmatic and positive way out.  Sure you
folks are very focused on this, but it struck me that the agenda looks
pretty ambitious for a 3-hour meeting.  In any case, just a thought that I
wanted to share.

Thanks and can't thank you enough for all your efforts.

Best,
Jeff
