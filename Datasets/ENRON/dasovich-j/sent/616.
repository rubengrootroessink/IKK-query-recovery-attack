Hi.  Hope the ride back to Sacramento went OK last nite.  It was nice to see 
you and catch up. I'm sorry things are so crazy, but in spite of it all, your 
attitude's pretty good.  And your new suede jacket is gorgeous.  

I know your life is very complicated and I don't want to make it worse, but 
if you ever have the time and inclination to go to lunch, dinner, movie, 
whatever, I'd definitely be up for it.  Hang in there.  Hope to catch up 
again soon.

Best,
Jeff
