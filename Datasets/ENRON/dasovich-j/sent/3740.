thank you very much for dinner last nite.  really nice of you.  it was 
delicious and sorry that we were a little obnoxious--that's what 5 hours in 
the car will do to you. 
great to see you guys.  really something about eldon's solo.  would have 
liked to see it.  plz make sure that he tells about it next time. 
and don't worry, we'll get the luggage thing worked out.  why don't you and 
i do the planning on that one.  what's the chance of you dropping of the 
"community bag," or the wine box with me on Friday nite and i can just 
check it in as mine? 
best, 
jeff
