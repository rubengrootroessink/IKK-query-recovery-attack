While I, too, am frustrated at how things turned out, I'm glad your content 
overall with the course.  Definitely one of the best--if not THE 
best--classes I've taken.  I really think that we need to get together 
tomorrow nite to finalize, but I don't feel like pushing it too much.  Your 
thoughts?

Best,
Jeff

Apology not necessary!  However, you are very kind to consider my
perspective on the group and project.  I am certainly a bit frustrated with
how this project is turning out.  We should have "white boarded" our ideas
and reached consensus in the very beginning I think.  It would have saved
all of us time.  I'm counting on Mark to drive this home for us smoothly.

But, at the end of the day, I am pleased with how much I learned in Tasker's
class, which is the ultimate point anyway.

Carolyn:

I wanted to apologize for the way the group dynamic has shaped up.  It's
clear to me that you're a bit frustrated, and if I've contributed, I
apologize.

You've done the most work on this project, your contribution has been very
significant, and I personally am not satisfied about the way that the stuff
you've pulled together (and your views) have been included.  At some point,
though, it gets tough beating one's head against the wall.  Seems to me
that, in a group, everyone should have some of their views
included---that's what groups and compromises are all about.  After all,
it's school.  We've made a lot of sacrifices to do it, and the point is to
learn.

Anyway, I hope you'll still comment on the presentation, and I'm glad that
you've agreed to do part of it on Thursday.  For my part, I felt that I
pushed yesterday about as much as I'm prepared to push and at this point,
I'll put the ratios tables together, offer a few edits, buy don' t see much
use going to the mat.

Overall, I think it'll be an okay presentation, though getting there has
been, well, bumpy.

But thanks very much for all the work you did.  It was important, and the
presentation is better off for it.

Best,
Jeff
