I would love for you to meet our new VP of Professional Services (who is,
incidentally, now for all intents and purposes running our company).  I
think you will love him.  He is very interested in the idea of working with
Enron and I want you to meet him.  Can we set up a dinner for the three of
us sometime in the next couple weeks?  I know your schedule is busy with
school, so why don=01,t you tell me a couple nights that work (other than
Mondays) and I will make it work on our end.  Please oh please.

Love,

Your Pal Cameron=20

P.S.  Going to Colleen=01,s new (to me) place for some wine tonight.  I=01,=
ll tell
her hello for you=01(
