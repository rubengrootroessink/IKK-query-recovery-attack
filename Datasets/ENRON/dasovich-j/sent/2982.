It's fun and games every day (can't wait to catch up---you will howl (or cry, 
not sure which)).  Miss you guys terribly.  Don't throw me out of the club 
for being AWOL, please.  Hope to see you soon.

Best,
Jeff

I had the same experience.  (As if my inbox wasn't in sorry enough shape as 
it is).  I'll ask Margo to check with them to be sure the problem is 
corrected.

Hope you're having fun....

Dear Gang:
I don't know about you folks, but I woke up to over 100 emails from Telecom 
Reports today.  It seems to border on spam at this point.  Is anyone else 
having this experience?  The info is very valuable, but I'm wondering if 
there's a way to get, say, 3 emails a day rather than the 50 or more I'm 
currently receiving.

Wondering if the lights will stay on today,
Jeff

USA: Senators renew high-speed Internet tax credit bill. 
  
01/23/2001 
Reuters English News Service 
(C) Reuters Limited 2001. 
WASHINGTON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - A bill that would encourage businesses to 
bring high-speed Internet access to underserved areas was reintroduced in the 
Senate on Tuesday, with the hopes that President Bush would include the item 
in his budget.
Computers equipped with a "broadband" or high-speed Internet connection can 
download information at a rate of up to 1.5 megabits per second, or about 25 
times faster than a standard, dial-up connection. While broadband access is 
currently available in many business districts and affluent residential 
neighborhoods, the service has not yet spread to less affluent or more 
sparsely populated areas. 
The bill would provide a five-year, 10 percent tax credit to Internet 
companies that extend broadband service to rural or underserved urban areas.
Companies who build "next generation" networks, with download speeds of up to 
22 megabits per second, would receive a 20 percent, five-year credit.
The bill was introduced by Republican senators Olympia Snowe of Maine and 
Orrin Hatch of Utah, and Democrats Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia and John 
Kerry of Massachusetts. It was co-sponsored by 32 other senators.
The 36 senators sent a letter to President Bush urging him to include the 
bill in his initial budget proposal.
The bill attracted the support of 59 senators and 115 House members last 
year, the letter claimed.
