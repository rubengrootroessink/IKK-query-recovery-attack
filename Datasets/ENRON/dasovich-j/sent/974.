Mona and I plan to be in Sacramento tomorrow at an AB 1890 Implementation 
Group meeting.  I think that Sue also has a conflict.  My thought was to have 
someone from the PR firm that Karen has brought on go and report back.  I'm 
supposed to give a presentation on gas tomorrow, but it's not a problem for 
me to cancel and go to S.D. if we think that it's vital for one of us to be 
there in person.   Thoughts?

Best,
Jeff
