Harry: You clearly did a fantastic job, particularly under the circumstances 
described by Leslie.  Thanks a million for your help--we really needed 
it--and you managed to leave with your credibility intact, to boot.

And thanks. too, to Leslie.  The EES piece of the California puzzle is 
extremely challenging (as you know) and your and Harry's efforts are greatly 
appreciated.  I can cover the hearings on Monday and Tuesday.  Thanks again.

Best,
Jeff
