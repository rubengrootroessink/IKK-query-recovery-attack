Greetings:
Unfortunately, I'll be in Mexico getting the Mexican version of hoof and 
mouth.  Bummer.  Of course, the highlight of the semester for me was seeing 
Ms Deepika at Squaw last weekend.  We should commit to a ski trip next year. 

Best,
Jeff

How about...I'll be in London?  Seriously!  It never
fails!  Must be karma-something!  No spring break and
no b-day celebrations for me...just hoof and mouth
disease.  I'll miss you all...who's birthday's are
next?  I'll just have to save my celebrations up, I
guess.  
Always something, 
Courtney
