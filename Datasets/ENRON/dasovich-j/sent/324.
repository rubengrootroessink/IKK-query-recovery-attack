I don't know if they have the authority, and I could be wrong, but this looks 
like an obvious set up by the administration.  Hold up a report from your 
auditor that sez, "it makes now sense to have the two separate, Poolco is the 
only way to go, and they must be merged."  Then legislation is launched, on 
the basis of the auditor's recommendation, to merge the PX and the ISO in 
California.  Looks like an audit whose message we'll want to pre-empt well in 
advance of the report going public.

Does the state of CA have the authority to do this?

scheduled a meeting with the ISO to commence the audit process on Monday
September 18.  ISO provides this notice in accordance with Tariff section
