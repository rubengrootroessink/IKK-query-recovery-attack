Well, get out there and weed, then.   Can't take Annie (too short a trip).  
I'm pretty sure that we'll be there.  Make tee times for 9 am?  You can wait 
till we see you to pay.  They did charge corkage---just a nice, not too 
expensive place.

There are a few pesky little weeds around some - not all - the tomatoes.
Lots around the melons, some in the herbs and flowers.  So you are not
taking Annie with you??  Please scout around for Liz Whiting's car keys.
They were in her purse and she can't find them now.  Look under the beds
etc. upstairs if you would please.

It had to be more than $50 per person!!!  Did they not charge the
corkage????????  Shall I mail you a check or wait till you are in  Napa?  We
would love to play golf Sunday - I will make a time if you are sure you will
be there - what time would you like??

That shirt?????????  Puh-leez.

Puh-leez.  We did the plastic and the rocks to avoid weeding.  How can
there be any weeding?  Unfortunately we can't stop by on the way up, but
likely on the way back, which may be Saturday night.  If so, do you guys
wan't to play golf on Sunday morning?  (Prentice is leaving with her pals
today, and I'm heading up sometime tomorrow.)

Dinner was exactly $50/person.  Thanks for bringing the wine----my shirt
loved it.

Best,
Jeff

Just in from watering the west 40.  I think this is going to be our best
year ever - lookin' good, lookin' good.  However, there is some serious
weeding that someone needs to do!!!

I am presuming you guys are stopping in Napa before your dome trek (which
is
why I thought I could give you a check immediately!).  Is that the case?
If
so, I hope you can join us in a nummy little repast!  If not, I will put a
check in the mail when you let me know the amount.  Unlike some, I always
carry my checkbook with me!

Those were incredibly beautiful knives that you guys gave Cameron!
