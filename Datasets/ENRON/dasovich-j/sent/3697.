David:
Thanks so much.  I'd almost given up hope.  I will be distributing the 
proposal immediately and attempting to garner support industry-wide, across 
the nation.  Can't make any promises of support, but will be working hard to 
try to bring people together.  I'll be in touch soon.  Don't hesitate to 
contact me to discuss it further.  415.782.7822.

Best,
Jeff
