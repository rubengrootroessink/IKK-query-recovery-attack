Here is the current list of emergency actions, motions, etc. by the
utilities and other notable parties in recent days. 


1.  SCE has filed a motion for summary judgement and a motion for injunctive
relief in its "filed rate doctrine" case in Federal District Court in LA to
require the CPUC to declare the rate freeze over and for a court order
requiring the CPUC to raise Edison's rates to recover all past and current
power costs.  This is a potentially critical case.


2.  PG&E filed a motion to require SoCalGas to deliver gas to it for core
consumption under the mutual assistance statute and their agreement with
SoCalGas.  SoCalGas has strongly protested the motion.

3.  PG&E has filed a motion to permit gas suppliers to receive a security
interest in the utility's accounts receiveables (CPUC approval required
under Sec. 851) in order for such suppliers to obtain collateral from the
utility which does not require cash.  Expedited two day response time was
requested.  The ALJ will issue a ruling determining how much time we will
have to respond.

4.  PG&E has filed an advice letter seeking to replace the weighted day
ahead PX price with the ISO ex post energy price as the cost element in the
PX credit for direct access customers.

5.  ORA/TURN have filed an emergency petition seeking to modify the EFO and
OFO procedures under the PG&E gas accord, specifically seeking to waive EFO
and OFO penalties and reducing the diversion charges the core would pay when
the noncore's gas is diverted to serve core load.  The charge would be
reduced to the actual cost of gas, thereby depriving noncore customers and
their suppliers of the cost of interstate transmission and any costs
assciated with the loss of the gas supply and its effect on the customers'
operations.  CMTA has filed strong opposition.

This is what we are aware of as of today.
