Soda Springs used to be a ski place (on the summit).  Hopefully, there's 
still something there (but with these conditions, could be very Spring-ee).

Here's where the Clair Tapaan lodge is located.  Is it close to the ski 
resorts?

Location

Clair Tappaan is located at 7000 feet, 45 minutes drive west of Reno and one 
and a half hours drive east of Sacramento just off of Interstate 80. From 
eastbound I-80, take the exit for Soda Springs/Norden and go 2.4 miles east 
on Donner Pass road. Look for our sign slightly up the hill on your left and 
the wide footpath leading up to the Lodge. Parking is available on either 
side of the road. You can check road conditions online at the CAL-TRANS 
website.
