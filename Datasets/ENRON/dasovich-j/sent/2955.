David:
Great start.  My biggest comment: needs to be shorter (thank the attention 
span of the press and the political process for that).  I talked to Phil.  
He's got an editor that he works with who can help.  I recommend that we have 
the editor try to boil it down to an "editorial" size piece.  Thoughts?

Best,
Jeff
