Duly noted.  I'll send you the latest.  I'll include you from this point on 
in the distribution list.  If it gets to be too much in your in-box, just let 
me know and I'll try to pare it back.  Here's the bottom line.  Folks have 
asked me to coordinate California to some degree and there'll be an 
expectation that we're well coordinated.  Again, this is not at all about 
making your life more difficult, just a case of being well-informed.  And my 
apologies for not having included you on the email distribution list sooner.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff,
I'd be happy to copy you on what I'm filing regarding QF energy pricing. I'd 
appreciate the same courtesy. I have no idea what Ken Lay is advocating in 
California becuase no one has ever sent me any information. I know he has 
been in California because of the conference calls, but don't know his 
message.
Hap
