Please keep the following confidential.  

Jessie Knight called.  Here's the latest.  

Seems the Chamber of Commerce is going to launch a campaign with the 
following messages:  1) Deregulation must go forward, not back.  2) The 
transition will continue to be a bit bumpy.  3) The best option businesses 
and families have is to switch to an alternative service provider.  

The Chamber has cut deals with ESPs (I didn't get all the details, but sounds 
like an exclusive) according to which the Chamber will aggregate customers 
and deliver them to the ESPs.  I believe that The New Power Company will be 
one of those ESPs.  

Ray McNally's sister, who is one of our very satisfied rez customers in S.D., 
will appear at the press conference with the Chamber to announce the 
program.  They are attempting to launch the program and have the press 
conference this week.  

The Chamber is also launching a program to educate S.D. politicians and 
business leaders on the benefits of retail choice and how to benefit from it.

The Chamber is still looking for a business customer to appear with them at 
the press conference.
