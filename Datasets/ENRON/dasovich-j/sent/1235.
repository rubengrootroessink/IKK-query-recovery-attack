T&J:

I think at this point, any more changes, and we're going to blow our 
collective brains out.  But here's a question.  What interest rate did we use 
to calculate the interest the County receives on its "ending balance?"  Ted, 
you likely have a much better feel for this, but should it be something like 
the 3-month commercial paper rate, or something?  Did we use the 20-year 
treasury?  Again, I think we likely ought leave the thing along at this 
point, but thought I'd throw it out there.  Tell me that it doesn't matter, 
please.

And Ted, I thought we agreed that the interest rate was 5.720928373983039 
(kidding).

Jackie:  Good luck with Schwab.  I'll keep my fingers and toes crossed.

Best,
Jeff
