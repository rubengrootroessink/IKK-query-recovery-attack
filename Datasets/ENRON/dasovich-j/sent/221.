Greetings folks.  We should decide how we want to handle.  One thing I'm not 
clear on and that I couldn't find in the syllabus is, what's the format for 
the write up?  If we're called on to discuss, do we simply discuss orally, 
some sort of simplistic PP slides, spreadsheets, other?  Anyway to discuss 
between now and Monday, or do we want to just take Dylan up on his offer?

Best,
Jeff

Hello all,

I will take a look at the case tonight.

Divvying is fine with me.
