FYI.  This is the bill to de-link the bonds from the DWR contracts (recall 
that the argument to end DA by the Gov's finance folks, the bond folks, and 
Angelides, the Treasurer stems directly from this linkage).  

Though Hertzberg was initially a supporter, his legal consultant has been 
scared off by the Gov's people (i.e., to de-link would "impair" the 
contracts, triggering breach, liquidated damages and the end of Western 
Civilization as we know it).  The Senate ain't buying that line.

As a result, it's now a Senate play, but they need Republicans to get the 
2/3's necessary for passage, which ain't likely to be easy.  We urging Brulte 
to go along, but only  in exchange for deleting the "no DA" language in AB1X 
and for legislative language assuring that DA will continue.

Best,
Jeff

		 Subject: SB 18 (Burton) - Bonding


Attached, please find SB 18 (Burton) relating to bonds.  This is a regular
session bill with an urgency clause which means it requires a 2/3 vote.  The
bill language was formerly associated with ABX2 10 (Hertzberg).  The bill
could be heard by the Senate Energy Committee as early as today however as
of this moment it is still not on calendar.
