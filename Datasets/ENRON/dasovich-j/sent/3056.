I've left messages describing our idea with TURN and the large 
cogenerators/marketers/producers, and I've spoken with the Farm Bureau and 
the California Manufacturers Association.  The Bureau and CMA agree with our 
idea and I've asked them to "pass the word along" to other customer groups 
and to try to ensure that its an integral part of the negotiations.  I'll be 
calling other customer groups and will report back on those conversations.

Best,
Jeff
