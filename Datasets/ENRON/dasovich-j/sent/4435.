Subject: SCE Advice 1534-E-A



On April 20, 2001, SCE filed Advice 1534-E-A with the Commission.

Title:
Establishment of Four New Balancing Accounts and other Tariff Revisions -
Supplemental Filing

Purpose:
This advice filing establishes four separate balancing accounts: 1) the SCE
Utility Retained Generation Balancing Account; 2) the SCE Contracts
Balancing Account; 3) the Procurement Costs Balancing Account; and 4) the
Ancillary Services Balancing Account.  In addition, this filing dedicates a
portion of SCE's residually determined generation rate and
Commission-approved surcharges between the four balancing accounts based on
estimated costs for a twelve-month period and establishes the Generation
Rate Trigger Mechanism. Furthermore, in conjunction with the implementation
of the four new balancing accounts and the Trigger Mechanism, this filing
1) modifies the Transition Revenue Account; 2) establishes the Net
Undercollected Amount Account; (3) eliminates the Transition Cost Balancing
Account; 4) eliminates the Generation Memorandum Accounts 2 ; and 5)
eliminates the Emergency Procurement Surcharge Balancing Account.
