The following article appeared in the Arizona Republic last week.  I will 
keep an eye out for the filing.

"Citizens Utilities says it won't triple its rates"

Citizens Utilities is assuring customers that it won't double or triple 
rates, even though the electric company is paying triple the normal amount to 
purchase energy.  Citizens recently announced a possible rate increase due to 
higher charges from its energy supplier, Arizona Public Service Co.  The 
company estimates it paid $19 million to APS for energy in June.  Citizens 
normally pays $6 million a month, spokesman Tom Ferry said.  Citizens 
customers can expect a rate increase, but the utility company is proposing to 
spread out the increases through a three year recovery period for the rate 
increase expected for June, July and August, Ferry said.

Citizens will file a plan requesting a rate increase with the ACC in a week 
or two.  Ferry wouldn't say what the rate increase would be if the ACC 
approves a shorter recovery period than the one Citizens proposes.  The 
earliest any rate increase could take effect would be February, an ACC 
spokeswoman said.  Ferry blamed the increase on a rise in summer temperatures 
and economic growth resulting in above-normal demand for electricity.
