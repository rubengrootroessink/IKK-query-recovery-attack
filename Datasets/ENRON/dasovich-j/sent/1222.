Hi Sue:

I hope the packing and other move-related things are going well---I know that 
something invariably happens that creates havoc.  Good luck.

I haven't wanted to bug you too much with all that's going on, so I thought 
I'd give you a quick update:

Scott and Bowen and I talked re: getting authority for EBS to dig dirt and 
install some facilities in California.  With some effort, we persuaded Scott 
that having dinner with Loretta Lynch, well, wasn't going to do get the job 
done (though Scott's not yet completely convinced).  Instead, Scott's going 
to get from the network folks substantially more detail on precisely what the 
project entails.  Once we've got that, we can meet with Commission staff and 
take their temperature on what sort of approval hoops we'd need to jump 
through in order to get authority to do the project, and what the time frame 
for approval would look like.  Scott agrees with this approach.  He's going 
to try to get more info from the network folks in Portland.  We likely will 
regroup to figure out "next steps" right after the first of the year.  Have 
any thoughts on this approach?
I do plan on coming every Thursday to the group meetings.  However, this 
Thursday is my girlfriend's birthday, and her parents (who live in the area) 
have had a little "special  event" planned for the past 6 months.  
Consequently, I will have to miss the GA Xmas party, which I'm very 
disappointed about----I really enjoy getting a chance to catch up with 
everyone.  I'll also therefore have to participate in Thursday's call by 
phone.  Apologies, but I'm sticking to the tried and true rule:  "Family and 
relationships first!"

Hope all is well.

Best,
Jeff
