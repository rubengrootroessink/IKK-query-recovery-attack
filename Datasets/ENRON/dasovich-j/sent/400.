Jeff & Mona:  We have confirmed that our contracts are silent on the issue.  
Question remains as to what the language of the original decision was...Can 
you suggest someone who can dig into this for us?  Should I just phone Mike 
Day?  Let me know...MLC

Likely needs to be a legal analysis based on the language of the original 
decision etablishing the credits.  But seems to me that we have a deal with 
our customers to receive service according to price, terms and conditions 
stated in our contracts with those customers, and that the contract language 
would govern how the credit is treated.  If  the contracts don't speak to the 
issue of credits, seems that our contract agrees to provide rez customers 
with service for a a certain price, and as such, it would be up to us whether 
we flow it through.  But a lawyer, I am not.  Are our contracts silent on the 
issue?

Best,
Jeff

Diane Huddelston called Lori Pinder about an issue;  Here it is:

Due to the merger btw SDG&G & Sempra Energy (about a year or less ago), a 
savings was realized.  The CPUC said these savings must be passed on to 
customers 1 time per year, in September.  They are called Annual Merger 
Credits.

Pursuant to all commercial contracts, Enron is entitled to keep the savings 
(per Diane).  What about the residential customer accounts?

Enron keeps the savings or should the residential customer receive?

Who could handle this issue for Diane?

Thanks, KC
