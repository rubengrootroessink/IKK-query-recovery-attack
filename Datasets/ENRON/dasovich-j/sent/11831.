Yep.  It's moving along.  The budget, and the R's desire to mess with Davis, 
are prolonging things a bit.  But all indications are that Loretta will hold 
DA until the 12th.  How'd the afternoon go?

Best,
Jeff

Subject: Language on bonds

Senator Burton's office expects bond language back from Legislative
Counsel sometime tomorrow, Tuesday.  As soon as we get a copy we will
forward it.  If the language is acceptable to Enron, then Bev, Scott and
I need to visit with Republicans to urge their support as soon as
possible.We are continuing to coordinate with the big users and some
other suppliers on this issue.
