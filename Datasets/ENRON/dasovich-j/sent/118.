Do not pay attention to the sitting bill that was attached on the last 
e-mail. The attached version was older that we though. AI will be faxing you 
a copy of the final version of AB970 within a 1/2 hour.

Summary of Davis/Alpert bill AB 260

Retro-active to June 1, 2000 through December 31, 2002, 6.5 cent/kWh cap on 
the energy component for residential and small commercial customers (under 
100 kW).  The Commission has the ability to extend through 2003.  The 
Commission also has the ability to adjust the cap.

Commission can use revenues from utility-owned assets, refunds from FERC to 
offset the undercollections.  (In addition, a companion bill was passed that 
provides $150 million of general fund money to offset undercollections.)

Large commercial/industrial/agricultural customers have an opportunity to 
"opt-in" to the 6.5 cent/kWh cap with an annual true-up.

SDG&E will under a prudence review by the CPUC, which may be another source 
of funds to offset the undercollection.

Specific classes subject to cap:

  Schedule A, all acute care hospitals, all public and private k-12 schools, 
all accounts on AL-TOU under 100 kW.

Transfer of $150,000,000 from the general fund  to a subaccount within the 
Special Fund for Economic Uncertainties.  
Appropriate those funds from the subaccount, to the commission, to reduce the 
adverse impact of high-cost wholesale energy purchases on certain ratepayers 
if a specified rate ceiling is in effect, and if the commission determines 
that a specified revenue shortfall would result in a ratepayer surcharge 
greater than 10%, and the electricity rates were directly linked to Power 
Exchange costs.  
Declare that, on January 1, 2004, any remaining balance in the account would 
revert to the General Fund.
Become operative only if AB 265 is enacted, as specified.
 Take effect immediately as an urgency statute.
