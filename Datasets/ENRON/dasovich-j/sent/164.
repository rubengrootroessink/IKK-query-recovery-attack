Unfortunately, Christine lives in the hills and I'm pretty sure I won't get
cell service there.  How bout if I plan on picking you up at 9:30.  If I'm
going to be later than that, I'll leave you a message on your work
voicemail.  Right now, I'll try to find a place where my phone works so I
can call you.
