Update:

I spoke with Robert Miyashiro at Finance (DOFs point person for those who 
have inquired) late Friday evening.  I tried to schedule some time to speak 
with him and bond counsel, but he begged off, but with good reason.

Through our conversation he intimated that they were greatly encouraged by 
the coalition proposal vis-a-vis reasonable controls on opt-in/opt-out and 
surcharges for incremental state costs.  It seems that they gave their canned 
presentation in the meeting and did not respond publicly to our proposal.

When pushed for direction relative to quantifying specific formulas, he 
expressed concern over the "proprietary" (he didn't say the word expressly) 
nature of DWRs rate calculations and a general reluctance to talk numbers at 
this stage of the game.

Much remains to be done, but I wanted to convey my relief and concur with 
Aaron that our position is not as gloomy as my initial impression.

More later,
Norm
