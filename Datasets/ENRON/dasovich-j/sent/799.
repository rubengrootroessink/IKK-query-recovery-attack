The call-in number and instructions for the 11/2 8:30 a.m. meeting are as 
follows:

Everyone will dial the toll free number 1-877-331-6867.
All the outside participants will be prompted to enter their access code, 
which is 600-480.

Wayne, your access code (room 4434) after dialing the toll free number will 
be 857-771.

I have asked for 4 outside ports and should anyone else need to join in, they 
may do so with the access code and without operator assistance.

The duration of the call is 3.5 hours. The call will terminate once everyone 
has hung up.

Please let me know if  any of you need additional information.

Thanks.
