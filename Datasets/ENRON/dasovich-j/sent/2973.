Mary Beth:
Thanks very much for passing these along to Laura Tyson.  There are two 
documents.  One is a word file with a suggested list of business leaders that 
we might bring into the discussions.  Please let the Dean know that it's a 
first cut and that all comments, suggestions, edits, etc. to the document are 
welcome and appreciated.  

The second is a pdf file from Credit Suisse First Boston giving CSFB's 
analysis of what's going on in California.  I think it provides further proof 
that California is still looking for, and ought to be very receptive to, a 
proposal like the one that we're working on. 

Could you let me know that you've received this?  Thanks again.

Best,
Jeff
