Greetings...Senator Sher and his bipartisan Senate Coalition held a press
conference endorsing SB28X, the powerplant streamlining bill.

Jan was available to respond to press on behalf of IEP following the press
conference -- commending the legislature for their efforts in promoting the
streamlining of siting power plants.

IEP will be suggesting amendments to this bill.

Thanks,
Jean

BIPARTISAN SENATE COALITION

ENDORSES POWERPLANT STREAMLINING BILL

Contact: Kip Lipper
916/445-6747

A bipartisan group of key senators announced their support today for
legislation to speed up powerplant siting without compromising environmental
protections. The legislation, SB 28X, jointly authored by Senators Byron
Sher (D-Stanford), Debra Bowen (D-Marina Del Rey), and Jim Battin (R-La
Quinta), is an important element of the Senate's comprehensive proposals
designed to help address the state's ongoing energy crisis.

"This measure is an important and urgent step forward in our efforts to
increase electricity supply in the state without sacrificing public health
and environmental protections," Sher said. "I'm pleased that our colleagues
from the other side of the aisle have agreed to work together in a
bipartisan effort to ensure that California's energy needs can be met
quickly and efficiently."

SB 28X enacts into law a series of changes designed to streamline siting of
new generation while ensuring full compliance with key environmental laws
and regulations (see attached summary).

The bill will be heard in the Senate early next week.

#     #     #



SB 28x, as proposed to be amended:

1. Establishes expedited siting process for so-called "repowers" of existing
powerplants to generate new emissions offsets and to meet state energy
demand.

2. Establishes expedited siting process for single-cycle peaker power plants
which can be brought on line quickly to meet state energy demand.

3. Allows powerplant approval process to begin while air emission offsets
are being obtained for powerplants needed to meet state energy demand.

4. Eliminate standby charges for distributed generation needed to meet state
energy demand.

5. Requires State to backfill 100% of property tax to local jurisdictions
that site new generating facilities sited to meet state energy demand.

6. Establishes an expedited process for retrofitting existing generation
facilities to
generate new offsets so that these facilities may run more frequently
without
violating air quality laws.

7. Establishes new process allowing air districts to postpone offset
requirements on powerplants provided the owners/operators of the plants post
funding to mitigate air emissions and agree to obtain emissions by the
earliest feasibledate.

8. Directs the state Air Resources Board to develop a statewide Air
Pollution Offset Bank and make information on the offsets available to
powerplant developers and other interested parties.

9.Requires air districts to establish expedited permit processes for the
permitting of standby electrical generation facilities and distributed
generation facilities.

10.Requires local agencies to provide initial written comments on proposed
powerplants within 45 days after filing of a siting application and final
comments within 90 days (current law sets no statutory deadline for such
comments).

11. Requires the CEC to take into account positive environmental, economic,
and system reliability benefits of new powerplants.

12.Provides that the State Supreme Court shall be the court of original
jurisdiction for legal challenges to CEC.

13.Requires the CEC to adopt by regulation an ex parte rule which provides
greater flexibility for communication among the public and parties to siting
proceedings provided such communications are disclosed on the record.
