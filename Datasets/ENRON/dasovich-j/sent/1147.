>LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will

>wholesale power prices to $100/MWh in its final order to repair the state's
>troubled electricity market, commissioners said Monday. 
>But the commissioners told Dow Jones Newswires they won't order generators
>to refund billions of dollars in windfall profits earned last summer as a
>result of spiking power prices in the state, despite pleas from state
>lawmakers and Gov. Gray Davis, because they lack the authority to do so. 
>"We still believe we cannot order refunds," one FERC commissioner said. "If
>there was an inch in the (Federal Power Act) that gave us the authority, we
>would take it. But that would destroy the future of deregulation." 
>FERC released a report earlier this month that largely pinned California's
>ongoing power crisis on the structure of the state's wholesale electricity
>markets. The commission also issued a proposed order requiring changes
>needed to make the market workably competitive. 
>The order found that electricity prices in the state rose to "unjust and
>unreasonable" levels last summer. But FERC fell short of ordering refunds,
>saying it lacked the legal authority to do so. 
>Instead, FERC proposed changes to the governing boards of the state's two
>wholesale-market operators - the Independent System Operator and Power
>Exchange - said the state's three investor-owned utilities should no longer
>be required to buy a majority of their power from the CalPX, and proposed
>penalties for utilities that put off buying the power they need until the
>last minute. 
>FERC also proposed capping the price paid to all bidders in California's
>power auctions at $150/MWh. Individual bidders could still get higher
>prices, but would have to justify their claims to FERC. 
>FERC may issue its final order as early as Dec. 13, and commissioners said
>California shouldn't expect it to differ from the proposed changes
>recommended by FERC earlier this month. 
>The comment period for FERC's draft order closed Nov. 22.

>Final Order Won't Order Refunds 
>Davis warned FERC commissioners at a public hearing in San Diego two weeks

>"Your proposed solution to our energy crisis does nothing to lower prices
>for California consumers," the Democratic governor told FERC on Nov. 13 at a
>meeting in San Diego. "Quite to the contrary, it is designed to bring our
>economy and our consumers to their knees." 
>California's power regulators and utilities also pressed for refunds. 
>The state's Public Utilities Commission said it has evidence of market abuse
>by generators and that consumers were overcharged $4 billion last summer for
>electricity. 
>Edison International unit (EIX) Southern California Edison, in its response
>to the FERC order, attached a study by a Massachusetts Institute of
>Technology economist, who found "considerable evidence" generators and power
>marketers deliberately withheld supply from California from June through
>September - when power usage is at its peak - to drive up wholesale prices. 
>But despite the allegations, FERC commissioners said they will not order
>refunds, though they said the state could legally return to cost-based
>rates. 
>One commissioner also warned a lower "soft cap" of $100/MWh would likely
>deter generators from building new power plants in the state, even as it
>limited price spikes. 
>"The truth of the matter is there is no painless or easy way for California

>Meanwhile, Californians are steaming ahead with their own solutions. 
>On Tuesday, the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, a Southern
>California consumer advocacy group, will hold a news conference announcing
>its own sweeping changes to the state's power market, which it will try to

>"California lawmakers want to be re-elected in 2002," one key lawmaker close

>And Davis is in meetings to replace the Cal-ISO and CalPX with a new entity
