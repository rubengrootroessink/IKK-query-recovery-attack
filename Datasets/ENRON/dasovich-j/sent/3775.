I think we ought to "share it" with folks.  Bill Gang, do you have any 
objections?

We can use the Air Force DA document under the Freedom of Information
Act.  We could also distribute it to the Administration and Legislature
anonymously.   Please advise.

If you had filed a Freedom of Information Act request, I would have sent it
to you, so I treated your request as the functional equivalent of a FOIA
request.  That basically means that it is in the pubic domain.  While you
can not say you are distributing it on the behalf of the Air Force, you can
certainly share it with anyone you wish.

Bill,

Thank you for the terrific fact sheet.  Is this something you have
distributed or
would you like me to distribute it?  I would of course not submit it on
behalf of
the Air Force?
