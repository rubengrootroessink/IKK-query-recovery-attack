You're in.  Yes, I was thinking of offering up my office.  

Also, what do you think about getting together real soon to start setting up 
the model for our finance paper?  We'll have to do the research, but I think 
setting the model up will be about 75% of the project.

Best,
Jeff

Greetings:

Well, there's a finance midterm coming up and some of us have discussed
getting together the weekend before for a study session.

I just grabbed an old list from last year so apologies if I've included
folks who ain't even in finance, or if I've left some folks off.  Sorry to
those who received in error, and please forward to anyone else who might be
interested.  Anyway, anyone interested?

Hope all is well with all.

Best,
Jeff
