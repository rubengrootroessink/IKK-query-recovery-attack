Hey,
Wouldn't this fix everything?   What a great idea-  a govenment owned=20

taxpayers?  I think Enron should cast aside its dependency on free markets,=

and throw its support behind this well thought out public initiative.  Let =

Calif. lawmaker pushes for state energy reserve
California State Sen. Steve Peace called for the state to set aside $2=20
billion of a projected $10
billion budget surplus to create a reserve account to serve the state=01,s=
=20
energy needs.
A representative at Peace=01,s office said the senator planned the fund as =
a=20
=01&cushion=018 to help
the state bounce back from energy price shocks like those that hit it last=

summer.
Peace, speaking Monday at a briefing on the upcoming state budget, suggeste=
d=20
that the
California Legislature set aside $2 billion to use at a later date.  The=20
funds could be included in
the budget that Gov. Gray Davis is scheduled to announce Jan. 10. =20
Ostensibly, the government
could use the funds to purchase some of the state=01,s transmission grid an=
d=20
generation assets, or
to build new assets.
In his remarks, Peace said some of the $2 billion could be used to build a=
=20
500-MW generation
facility, which he estimates at $300 million, a peaker that could be set up=
=20
for $16 million,
or a transmission grid such as the $200 million system a California utility=

has proposed for the
southern part of the state.

partnerships, or to capitalize
publicly owned utilities are all options which California policymakers may=

have to consider
if [FERC] is unable to bring wholesale energy markets under control,=018 he=
 said.
Still, representatives at the senator=01,s office stressed that Peace was n=
ot=20
making any policy
decisions in his statement. Rather, a representative said, Peace was acting=
=20
in his capacity as
chairman of the Senate Budget and Fiscal Committee and setting aside funds=

that can be available
for future use.
Peace=01,s initiative comes on the heels of a report by the Legislature=01,=
