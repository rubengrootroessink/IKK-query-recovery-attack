		 Subject: ***** NEW CALIFORNIA POLLING DATA *****

Mirant calculated some good data and the rest of the gens are going to do the 
same

Mirant:  80% Increase in energy production vs. under IOU ownership
 6% forced outage rate vs. 19.8% forced outage rate of the same plants owned 
by the IOUs
IEP will put together some data

The big news is the POLLING.  IEP and Reliant have just completed some 
polling for California.  Here are the fascinating results -- which should 
help shape our message.

This polled as the #1 voter issue

58% say its  not appropriate to use tax dollars to bailout by the utilities 
by buying transmission, hydro or stock options.

Who favors the state getting the following in return for dollars (forced to 
choose one):
Hydroelectric -- 28%
Stock options -- 27%
Transmission -- 18%

50% say its OK for the government to play a larger role in purchasing and 
distribution
48% say the state SHOULD NOT takeover transmission
39% say the state SHOULD NOT create a public power agency

45% oppose re-regulation which is estimated to cost $40 billion

Asked if it is fair for the generators who are owed $1 billion to be forced 
to sell without assurance of being paid, 47% said this was unfair

WHo's to blame:
38%  Legislature
22% Utilities
11% Davis
10% Generators withholding power

52% says Davis is doing a good job
38% said he's not
This was reported to be the same as for Bush and "Davis will know that"

49% says Davis is on the wrong track

Would you want to re-elect Davis?
38% yes
42% replace him

38% are angry about it -- they said this isn't enough for the "pitchfork 
parade" yet

33%  only this amount thinks Davis' handling is "exceptional" or "good"
10% for the regulators
12% for the legislature

Now for the bad news:

ASKED PREVIOUSLY -- If rates went up 10% without any blackouts or if there 
was no rate increase with blackouts every day of the summer, which do you 
prefer
Blackouts -- 46%
Rate inc   --  41%

ASKED IN THIS ROUND -- If rates went up 25% without any blackouts or if there 
was no rate increase with blackouts every day of the summer, which do you 
prefer
Blackouts -- 47%
Rate inc   --  36%
