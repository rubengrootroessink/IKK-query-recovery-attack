Subject: Fw: memo re EOB and CalPX FERC filings


Attached is a memorandum from Ellison & Schneider summarizing the California
EOB's FERC Bid Cap Complaint and the CALPX's Proposed Tariff Amendment on
bid caps.  Interventions are due Sept. 12 and Sept. 18, respectively.

Recently, IEP forwarded a Restructuring/Transmission Task Force
solicitatation seeking to raise funds to help fund IEP's intervention in
matters such as this.  To date, IEP has received two responses.  In the
absence of significant funding, IEP will be unable to utilize consultants to
help in the monitoring and filing of interventions in
restructuring/transmission matters.  We will endeavor to continue to keep
the members apprised of key issues through the use of in-house staff, but
resources will be limited and may make the preparation and filing of
interventions difficult.  For example, IEP is unlikely to file an
intervention at the FERC in response to the EOB and CALPX filings given time
and resource constraints.

If you are interested in funding additional support in this effort, please
respond ASAP to the solicitation distributed in August.  Thank you.
