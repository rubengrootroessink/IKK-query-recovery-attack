Thanks, Mark.  Sounds good.  As it turns out, there is a very slight chance 
that I might be on the panel in California with Prof. Littlechild.  I'll take 
you/him up on the offer to get together while he's here. 

Best,
Jeff

Professor Littlechild has written a peper on the importance of retial markets 
(being open) to the development of a well-functioning liberalised/deregulated 
energy market, i.e., wholesale markets alone to suffice.  As it turns out, 
Paul Dawson and Chris Day of my team here in London have reviewed and 
commented on earlier drafts of this paper.  We have paid for none of his 
research, and there will be no explicit recognition of Enron support for the 
work.  However, Littlechild, as Jeff already knows, has been asked to present 
his paper to a seminar/conference in California, and to a Tokyo research 
institute.  Much of his travel is paid for, but he was not being compensated 
for his time in making these trips.  Given that his message is one we want to 
get out into the marketplace of ideas, I have agreed to pay him for one day 
of his usual professional rate/fees, each, for San Francisco and Tokyo.  In 
turn, he has offered to come into our offices (your offices) to meet with 
you, discuss his research, and to learn more about your business and your 
issues.  May i suggest that if you are interested, and I think this is a 
worthwhile way to exchange ideas/views, that you just contact him directly, 
referencing that you work with me and I passed along his offer.  I will be 
sending to each of you a copy of a monograph I have on the paper (I am not 
sure if it is the full piece of work) for your information and future 
reference.  Nick - after meeting him, you might inquire as to whether you can 
publish his paper on your Japan web-site.  thanks and let me know if you need 
any more information.   mcs

Dear Mark

Sorry to keep pressing you, but I am not sure whether you received this
message and whether the proposed support is acceptable to you.  I received
only your subsequent comment that VAT is no problem.  I need to give an
answer to Berkeley and Tokyo before I leave in a few hours time.
Regards
Stephen
