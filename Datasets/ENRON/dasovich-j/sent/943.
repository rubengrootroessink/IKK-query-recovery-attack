SUMMARY: 
Recommended: 
1997 Opus One Napa Valley Red Wine (100) -- Could the 1997 Opus One be that 
elusive wine that one never finds? In my continual pursuit for wine nirvana, 
I have traveled to Bordeaux and back with stops in Italy and Australia and 
for what? Besides losing my luggage, tracking through customs and using 
non-functional phone cards, I have been searching for that wine of 
perfection. Could this wine finally be the one? This just released Opus One 
may be the absolute finest young red wine I have ever tasted in a bottle 
(barrel samples don't count). Aristocratically structured the 1997 Opus One 
magnificently perfumes the air with aromas of ripe, succulent fruit, 
fragrant, sweet earth and delicate, white flowers. Persistent to the point of 
perfection, this wine does not allow its captive audience to escape its web 
of Cabernet ecstasy. Made with the five important varietals of Bordeaux (82% 
Cabernet Sauvignon, 8% Cabernet Franc, 5% Merlot, 4% Malbec, and 1% Petit 
Verdot), this spellbinding wine commands attention. This is my top wine of 
the year. (Best Served 2002-2018). ($130)
