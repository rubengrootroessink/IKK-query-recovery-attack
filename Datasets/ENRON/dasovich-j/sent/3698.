Thanks.  Lamentably, they don't have a plan.  In fact SoCalGas is saying, "No 
problems."

My recollection is that this sheet is a bit vague on detail.

California's gas problems are twofold:

Wellhead prices are still high.  CERA is the best place to get more data on 
drilling activity, etc.

Instate capacity is tigh in PG&E and SDG&E.  CEC did a study, no?  In any 
event California utiilties probably have plans to eliminate the bottlenecks.
