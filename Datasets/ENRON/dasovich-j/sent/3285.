I took a stab at drafting the memo.  I pooped out on the last question, 
however and was only able to jot down some thoughts.  Caution:  The memo 
ain't been proofed.  I did it as a memo to the CEO of Timberland, but we 
don't need to do it that way.  Also attaching files (one each for each of the 
scenarios asked for, so that folks could see what I did).  Have not 
constructed the "one-page attachment, however.  Let me know what you think.

Best,
Jeff

I jotted down my answers to the questions.  Feel free to use as needed.  I 
need
to get things off my plate for the next few days while I work on some other
homework problems.  Of course, I will still help out if anyone needs any
assistance.
