FYI.  Note that TURN sez that the Commission should use the enactment date of 
AB1X as the date that the rate freeze ended.

		 Subject: TURN Testimony -- Rate Stabilization Proceeding

Yesterday (the 8th) was the day for parties to file testimony in the Rate
Stabilization Proceeding.  I have done a quick review of TURN's testimony,
and they did not submit tables which go back and calculate the impact of
adopting its proposed accounting changes on transition cost recovery and the
TRA undercollection balance.  In its testimony, TURN stated that it tried to
do such a calculation, but that the numerous adjustments which the UDCs had
made to their regulatory accounts since last summer made the task alot more
difficult than anticipated.  TURN estimates, however that PG&E's TCBA
balance as of 12/31/01 would be approximately $5.1 billion, while SCE's
would be $2.9 billion.  TURN states that they have requested through a data
request that the UDCs do the tables for them, but that if they do not
comply, that the commission should direct the UDCs to provide the tables.

Also, TURN has taken the position that the enactment of AB X 1 has
effectively ended the rate freeze and the date of the enactment of the
statute  is the one the Commission should pick for purposes of declaring the
rate freeze over.

I have not gone through other parties testimony yet, but wanted to let you
know what TURN has done (or not done).
