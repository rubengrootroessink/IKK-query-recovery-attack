It's about 90% certain that I'm out of the office on the 3rd.  Thank you, 
Sue, for helping out.  

Best,
Jeff

 Thanks for your time, Sue.

 I hope I am not causing confusion - we also emailed Jeff Dasovich to
ask if he had time to talk with the Australians - he said he was going to
see what he could do.

 If you or Mr Dasovich might have time to give these guys a market
participant's view that would be great - at the moment they are only seeing
the CPUC, the CAISO and PG&E.

 Would you maybe have time to talk to them on Tuesday, July 3rd? They
could meet anytime between 1.00PM up to 4.00PM and then they need to head
off to the airport. Maybe they could take either of you out for lunch?

 Best wishes,

 Sabine.
