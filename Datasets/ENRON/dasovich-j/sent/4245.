Dude:
Two things.  First, in the midst of the craziness on Friday, my black, 
Northface parka ended up getting put someplace at Sarah's that I wasn't 
privvy to, and consequently I couldn't find it.  My house keys are in it, so 
it would great to get it back.  Could you check with Bob/Sarah and see if 
it's floating around someplace over there?  Muchos gracias.

Second, could you do me a favor?  Could you pay me the full amount for Squaw 
and then collect from Cameron for what she owes you?  Sorry to be a pain in 
the ass, but I think logistically, it'll be a whole helluvalot easier to 
manage it that way (at least from my end).  And to be an even bigger 
pain.....since my schedule's a disaster with school coming to a close, could 
you stick the check in the mail?  My address is:

366 Dolores St., #3
SF, 94110

Sorry for all the hassle.

Happy birthday, man.

Best,
Jeff
