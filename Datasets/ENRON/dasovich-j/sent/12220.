Davis spokesman under fire for stock=20
By Amy Chance and Dale Kasler

(Published July 31, 2001)=20
Davis administration spokesman Steve Maviglio acknowledged Monday that he=
=20
bought stock in Calpine Corp. in June, at a time when the company was=20
announcing a breakthrough in its bid to build a controversial San Jose powe=

plant.=20
His disclosure came several days after Gov. Gray Davis dismissed five state=

Davis administration officials may have improperly mixed their private=20
finances and their public roles.=20
Maviglio, now acting as interim communications director for the=20
administration, said he put in an "open" order for Calpine stock May 31,=20
agreeing to buy 300 shares once the stock hit a certain price.=20
He said that threshold was met June 20, the day after an action by the=20
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission brought down "all energy stock prices=

Maviglio said he bought the stock for his individual retirement account, an=

had no control over the exact date of purchase.=20
Maviglio touted the company in his role as spokesman to the governor in a=

"They have made a clear commitment to invest in California's future,"=20
Maviglio said at the time. "Their pricing has been far more reasonable than=

any other generator."=20
In the interview, Maviglio also contrasted Calpine and Texas-based=20
generators. He said Calpine "took a different tack from the Joe Bobs of the=

world," an apparent reference to Joe Bob Perkins, a senior executive with=
=20
Reliant Energy Inc. of Houston.=20
Maviglio acknowledged the stock ownership several days after the=20
administration ended its relationship with several energy consultants who=
=20
held stock in energy companies, including Calpine.=20
Under pressure from Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican who hopes t=

=20
several weeks scrambling to answer questions about the stock holdings and=

potential conflicts of its consultants and energy traders.=20
Jones said Monday that Maviglio should be fired.=20
"These actions are unethical, unconscionable, unacceptable, and heads shoul=
d=20

t=20
all of his staff to immediately file updated conflict-of-interest statement=

to reflect current holdings.=20
Jones, who last week asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to=20
investigate administration consultants for insider trading, also said the=

probe should be expanded "to include all of the governor's staff."=20
Federal law and SEC regulations forbid anyone from trading stocks while=20
possessing "insider information" -- relevant facts not available to the=20
public, according to the SEC. Violations can bring lawsuits and criminal=20
prosecution.=20
Michael Prozan, a Menlo Park lawyer and expert on insider trading, said the=

prohibition against it originally focused on halting company executives fro=

Davis' office was instrumental earlier this year in paving the way for=20
removing barriers to construction of a Calpine plant in San Jose. On May 30=

after opposing the project for years, San Jose Mayor Ron Gonzales announced=

he had negotiated an agreement addressing his concerns and agreed to suppor=

as=20
the state Energy Commission threatened to approve it over local objections.=
=20
On June 20, the company announced it had won tentative state approval to=20
build the plant.=20
Maviglio said he buys many stocks and that Enron Corp. and Calpine are the=
=20
only energy generators among them. He owns 100 shares of Enron stock, which=
=20
he purchased in 1996.=20
"I deal with hundreds of California companies just about every day, and thi=

going on in the world. If there's a standard that I can't invest in somethi=
ng=20
that I have general public knowledge of, then I wouldn't have any stocks at=
=20
all."=20
Maviglio said that the "open" order he placed meant that he could not have=
=20
used inside information to make his stock purchase.=20
"Had I had specific knowledge about a contract being signed or what actuall=
y=20
happened in the office of the mayor of San Jose ... that would have been=20

Calpine stock, despite the company's considerable success, has slipped in=

recent weeks because of general investor anxiety about the California energ=

The stock, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange, closed at $49.30 on=

May 31, the day Maviglio says he placed the purchase order. The order was=
=20
executed as the stock dipped below $40 on June 20, closing that day at=20

profits. On Monday, the stock closed at $37.13.=20
Last week, the Davis administration stopped doing business with five energy=

administration lawyers "came to the determination that there are possible=

violations of the law or close to it."=20
"It's not a crime to own energy stock," Maviglio said Monday. "The differen=

Davis energy aide leaves -- without pay=20
By Emily Bazar
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published July 31, 2001)=20
A high-paid consultant to Gov. Gray Davis who came under fire for his=20

Under terms of a settlement made final Monday, former Clinton damage contro=

Because Lehane and Fabiani each received at least $10,000 under contract wi=

Southern California Edison in the past year, Lewis Uhler, president of the=

shame that politics gets in the way of public service."=20
Uhler, however, said he believes Lehane and Fabiani represent a larger=20

Power delivery efficiency questioned: Output at low-cost generating plants=
=20
has been cut while costlier ones continue to operate.
By Carrie Peyton
Bee Staff Writer
(Published July 31, 2001)=20
California is sometimes deliberately cutting output from low-cost power=20
plants while running more expensive ones, utility and grid officials say.=
=20
The sporadic episodes haven't cost much yet, but they illustrate a=20
potentially troubling disconnect in the system that has quickly grown betwe=
en=20
two agencies that help deliver electricity to a power-strapped state.=20
"We seem to be building this inefficiency into the system, and it doesn't=
=20
seem to be getting better," said Mike Florio, a consumer advocate who sits =
on=20
the governing board of the Independent System Operator.=20
The trouble is that the ISO, created in 1996 to manage the power grid in a=
=20
deregulated electric market, tries to run the grid by auctions that -- in=
=20
theory -- provide the cheapest electricity for the state's consumers.=20
Meanwhile, the state Department of Water Resources, which in January steppe=
d=20
in to buy power on behalf of cash-strapped utilities, isn't bidding at some=
=20
auctions because it believes it can provide cheaper power if it doesn't.=20
"We have an inefficient market and an inept government entity. It's sort of=
=20
the worst of both worlds," Florio said, criticizing his agency and the DWR.=
=20
ISO staffers decline to discuss the situation in detail, saying it involves=
=20
confidential bidding behavior.=20
But Pete Garris, chief of operations for the power-buying arm of the=20
Department of Water Resources, confirmed that the ISO has been asking his=
=20
agency to take part in more auctions, but the state has declined.=20
The state's role is to buy electricity for customers of utilities whose=20
credit was no longer good enough to buy on their own, he said.=20
"We're not in it to do those kinds of marketing functions," he said. "It's=
=20
not necessarily a good fit."=20
Some of the ISO auctions are used to lessen congestion on transmission line=
s.=20
Others are used to stabilize the grid by slightly increasing or decreasing=
=20
output when demand doesn't match forecasts.=20
Generally, the highest-cost power plants should be the ones cutting back, a=
=20
process the industry calls "decking."=20
But since May, on ISO orders, Southern California Edison has repeatedly=20
throttled back on the Mohave Generating Station, which produces some of the=
=20
cheapest power available to California today, costing as little as $10 to $=
20=20
a megawatt-hour.=20
Edison, which owns a majority share of Mohave, has cut its output by 5,660=
=20
megawatt-hours between May and July, about one-half of 1 percent, at the=20
ISO's behest, according to data Edison provided to The Bee.=20
The ISO could probably have saved the state's consumers $370,000 at one pla=
nt=20
if it had asked a higher-cost gas-burning plant to cut back instead of=20
Mohave, a coal-burning workhorse in Laughlin, Nev., Florio said.=20
The amount sounds like "small potatoes," but in some ways it is more alarmi=
ng=20
than the $14 million the state lost recently by selling excess power for le=
ss=20
than it paid, he said.=20
Industry experts agree that such below-cost sales are common in a business=
=20
where power needs fluctuate dramatically based on the weather.=20
By contrast, "this is a dead weight loss. Higher costs are being incurred f=
or=20
no good reason," Florio said.=20
"The question is, why is the ISO calling on Mohave and not (cheaper) gas=20
plants? The answer is, the gas plants aren't bidding ... probably because=
=20
they're contracted with DWR," he said.=20
Four Corners, another low-cost coal plant partly owned by Edison, has also=
=20
been throttled back at ISO request, Edison officials said.=20
In addition, so few bidders have shown up at ISO auctions to ease stress on=
=20
transmission lines that the system has fallen into disarray, with the ISO=
=20
instead ordering across-the-board power production cuts that are boosting=
=20
costs, Florio said.=20
For its part, the ISO will say only that "we are making the most economical=
=20
decisions we can based on the bids available," said spokeswoman Stephanie=
=20
McCorkle.=20
DWR's Garris said the state and the ISO have been meeting repeatedly on=20
bidding and other coordination issues, and he hopes to have a=20
smoother-running system in place by next summer.=20

Davis: FERC excluding $5 billion of owed refunds=20
By Jim Sanders
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published July 31, 2001)=20
A ruling by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission last week could cost=
=20
Californians $5 billion in energy refunds, according to Gov. Gray Davis, wh=
o=20
filed a formal request Monday for a rehearing in the case.=20
Although the commission's order suggested that California is owed refunds=
=20
because of exorbitant electricity prices during the recent energy crisis, t=
he=20
order's fine print placed severe limits on such refunds, Davis said.=20
"FERC is up to its old tricks again," he said. "They talk about refunds for=
=20
California. But in this case, talk really is cheap: The details of its late=
st=20
order show it has no intention of making California whole."=20
Tamara Young-Allen, a FERC spokeswoman, declined comment Monday and said th=
e=20
agency does not discuss pending cases.=20
California is seeking $8.9 billion in alleged overcharges for electricity=
=20
purchased from May 2000 to June 19, when FERC imposed new rules to prevent=
=20
price gouging.=20
On Wednesday, FERC ordered hearings to determine precisely how much money=
=20
electricity generators would have to pay in refunds to California.=20
At the time, Davis applauded FERC's ruling, saying it validates California'=
s=20
claim that "significant refunds are due" and that the agency's action "gets=
=20
us closer to realizing that refund."=20
But after poring over details of the 40-page order, state officials said=20
Monday that it excludes from consideration more than half the amount sought=
=20
by the state -- leaving $3.9 billion in dispute.=20
Attorney Barry Goode and Nancy McFadden, key members of Davis' energy team,=
=20
said the FERC order would not allow refunds:=20
For about $2 billion in alleged overcharges stemming from electricity=20
purchased by Californians between May and October of last year.=20
For electricity bought by the state Department of Water Resources from=20
private companies this year. The state says it is owed about $3 billion fro=
m=20
such purchases.=20
The FERC ruling means that only DWR's purchases through the state's=20
now-defunct Power Exchange or through the operator of a statewide electrici=
ty=20
transmission grid will be considered for refunds, officials said.=20
Such limitations by the regulatory agency are impractical because the marke=
t=20
was dysfunctional, leaving DWR with few options, when the state began buyin=
g=20
electricity for debt-strapped private utilities in January, Goode said.=20
"Now FERC says Californians are not entitled to refunds even though they=20
determined the prices were excessively high," Davis said. "It's time for FE=
RC=20
to decide who they are working for: the greedy out-of-state generators or t=
he=20
people of California."=20
The motion filed Monday sets the stage for a possible lawsuit.=20
"We are calling on FERC to change its order," Davis said. "If it doesn't, w=

With the future of California's investor-owned utilities clouded by the=20

Cities, public-power advocates and state Sen. Nell Soto, D-Pomona, are=20

"My solution to the power crisis is to reassert our interests and declare o=

"You get to choose the type of energy you want. ... I can't think of a bad=

After Yolo County officials last year denied an effort to form a public pow=

There are those that warn, however, that pubic power is not without risk.=

"This bill does not address generation," said Dale Hunter, a PG&E lobbyist,=

SDG&E denies it deceived ratepayers about debt =20

Company calls gain on sales, debts 'separate transactions' By Craig D. Rose=

UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER  July 31, 2001  San Diego Gas & Electric yesterd=
ay=20
denied allegations that it systematically lied about the debt it racked up=
=20
during the power crisis, despite revelations that the company earned hundre=
ds=20
of millions from some power sales.  SDG&E and its parent company, Sempra=20
Energy, acknowledged making profits from selling electricity but insisted=
=20
those gains have no bearing on the $750 million debt the utility claims to =
be=20
owed by customers for power purchases during the energy crisis.  "Those are=

completely separate transactions," said Ed Van Herik, a spokesman for SDG&E=
.=20
The company's effort to seal a deal with the state to clear the $750 millio=
n=20
debt has come under attack by the Utility Consumers' Action Network. The Sa=
n=20
Diego-based consumer group says SDG&E's claimed debt is the result of=20
selective bookkeeping, bordering on fraud.  The bottom line, says UCAN, is=
=20
that SDG&E engaged in deception and probably owes its customers money. =20
SDG&E, which claimed to have sold customers electricity without markups,=20
actually "was buying electricity at a low price and selling it at a higher=
=20
price to us," said Shames. "SDG&E customers have been systematically lied t=
o=20
over the past year about this balancing account."  UCAN says that SDG&E=20
earned an estimated $450 million from its power sales to the state, while=
=20
publicly declaring that it was posting only losses from buying power.  Sham=
es=20
said much of the information leading to UCAN's conclusion came from a=20
detailed analysis of documents made available in recent weeks.  The state=
=20
Office of Ratepayer Advocates, meanwhile, yesterday said a new filing by=20
SDG&E that claims its power-sales profits belong to stockholders, not=20
consumers, is "specious" and "without merit."  Van Herik insisted the compa=
ny=20
had not been misleading. The spokesman noted that the company earlier was=
=20
required to buy electricity from the Power Exchange, a now-defunct=20
marketplace established by the state as part of its deregulation plan.  "Wh=
at=20
we said is that we were buying electricity for our customers and passing=20
along the cost without markup," said Van Herik.  What SDG&E failed to=20
publicly announce was that it was simultaneously selling electricity to the=
=20
Power Exchange for an apparently healthy profit.  Under certain contracts,=
=20
SDG&E had locked in electricity at prices substantially below going rates=
=20
during the ongoing power crisis. The company declined yesterday to reveal=
=20
terms of the contracts. But UCAN estimates the contracts provided electrici=
ty=20
to the utility at no more than 5 cents per kilowatt-hour.  SDG&E then sold=
=20
that relatively cheap power to the Power Exchange for a higher price and=20
pocketed the profit, which it also declined to disclose.  As it profited fr=
om=20
the power sales, SDG&E bought power at higher prices from the exchange and=
=20
billed customers for what it paid.  Whenever SDG&E's costs to buy electrici=
ty=20

City officials are expecting to get their first look today at long-awaited=

plans to build the largest power plant in North County since the Encina pla=

Escondido, Sempra spokesman Tom Murnane said.  "It (the application) is ver=

the development of a business park."  Sempra is building the project in=20
partnership with JRM Real Estate, a Carlsbad-based developer.  The Californ=

Energy Commission will have final say on the power plant, which could take=

three to four years to get on line. The City Council will decide on the=20

idea was broached in January. The project addresses two needs: The power=20
plant would provide enough energy to power almost a half-million homes, and=

the business park would bring higher-paying jobs to a city with the lowest=

THE STATE
Davis' Energy Advisors Draw SEC Attention
Probe: Under review is the possible use of inside information to buy power=
=20
company stocks. GOP rival of governor requested the inquiry.
By WALTER HAMILTON JEFFERY L. RABIN and DARYL KELLEY
TIMES STAFF WRITERS

July 31 2001

The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a preliminary inquiry=
=20
into whether energy consultants advising Gov. Gray Davis used inside=20
information to trade stocks of power companies doing business with the stat=
e,=20
a source with knowledge of the matter said Monday.

The federal agency began its review late last week, the source said, in=20
response to a request from California Secretary of State Bill Jones. A=20
Republican rival of Davis, Jones charged that stock trading by consultants=
=20
may have violated federal laws barring buying and selling based on=20
information not available to the public.

On Friday, top aides to the governor disclosed that five consultants had be=
en=20
fired for possible conflicts of interest between their official positions a=
nd=20
their personal finances. As news of the SEC inquiry spread through the=20
capital Monday, Davis officials were confronted by a flurry of questions=20
about who in the administration owns energy stocks.

Financial disclosure records filed by the governor's spokesman, Steve=20
Maviglio, show that he owns between $10,000 and $100,000 in a Texas company=
=20
he and his boss have accused of making "obscene" profits while California h=
as=20
been "on its knees." Maviglio said he bought the shares in Houston-based=20
Enron Corp. in 1996.

"It's not a crime to own energy stock," Maviglio said.

He also owns 300 shares of San Jose-based Calpine Corp., which has the=20
largest share of the $43 billion in long-term state power contracts.

Maviglio placed the order for the stock on May 31, one day after San Jose's=
=20
mayor dropped his opposition to a controversial Calpine plant favored by th=
e=20
governor and others. Under the terms of Maviglio's purchase, the transactio=
n=20
was completed about three weeks later when the stock reached $40 a share, a=
=20
value of $12,000. It has since fallen in value.

"I viewed it as a good long-term investment," Maviglio said, adding that he=
=20
purchased the shares for his retirement account based on publicly available=
=20
information.

The Davis administration has spared Calpine the kind of fierce criticisms=
=20
that it has leveled at other electricity suppliers, such as Enron. But=20
California's grid operator has identified the company as one of many energy=
=20
merchants to overcharge the state millions of dollars.

The fired consultants also owned shares in Calpine, ranging in value from=
=20
several thousand dollars to more than $100,000, records show.

Another top Davis administration official, legal affairs secretary Barry=20
Goode, disclosed in his economic interest statement that he recently held=
=20
between $100,000 and $1 million in another out-of-state company accused of=
=20
multimillion-dollar price gouging.

In a statement, Goode said he sold his stock in Williams Co's. a month afte=
r=20
he began working for the governor in February. Goode said the shares were=
=20
supposed to be sold before he went on the state payroll, but his broker=20
failed to do so.

In light of the recent disclosures, Secretary of State Jones said the=20
governor must do more to ensure the public that its interest comes first.

"The governor should direct all of his staff to immediately file updated=20
conflict of interest statements that reflect current holdings and any=20
activity since their last statement of economic interest was filed," said=
=20
Jones, who is seeking the GOP nomination for governor.

Word of the SEC's entry into California's energy problems comes as the=20
governor faces harsh criticism from lawmakers and others for the quick and=
=20
broad hiring of highly paid private consultants to guide him through the=20
crisis.

In his written request to the SEC, Jones said that recently filed disclosur=
e=20
documents showed that at least one consultant bought and sold shares of two=
=20
energy companies within the same month, raising "a red flag" about the=20
possibility of insider trading.

State law prohibits officials from participating in decisions involving the=
ir=20
personal financial interests.

The five consultants fired last week were among 11 named in Jones' letter,=
=20
delivered to the San Francisco office of the SEC last Wednesday. It was not=
=20
clear which individuals are the focus of the SEC's inquiry, or whether the=
=20
agency's review would result in any charges.

Two of the former traders said Monday that they had not been contacted by=
=20
federal investigators and knew nothing of an inquiry into possible insider=
=20
trading.

But William Mead, fired Thursday, said it is no mystery why so many of his=
=20
colleagues owned Calpine stock.

Mead said he bought it 2 1/2 years ago and made so much money he recommende=
d=20
it to his colleagues last year, while they all still worked for the=20
now-defunct California Power Exchange in Alhambra. Calpine power was not=20
traded on that exchange, so there was no conflict of interest, he said.

Mead and three other energy traders--hired by the state in February and=20
March--were terminated by the Davis administration for allegedly buying pow=
er=20
for the state from Calpine while owning the company's stock. Fired traders=
=20
Herman Leung, Peggy Cheng and Constantine Louie did not list the date of=20
their Calpine purchases on financial statements that the state required to =
be=20
filed only two weeks ago.

"But I'm sure they bought it while they were still at the power exchange,=
=20
because that's when we discussed it," Mead said. "It was kind of like a=20
hobby. I'm sure it wasn't done with the intent to manipulate."

Former trader Elaine Griffin, who also owned Calpine stock and resigned two=
=20
weeks ago to take another job, said she didn't know she owned energy=20
securities until she checked with her financial advisor July 13, just befor=
e=20
leaving her state job.

Griffin said she and her husband own about $10,000 worth of Calpine stock i=
n=20
individual retirement accounts managed by their advisor, who bought the sto=
ck=20
Feb. 1 without their knowledge, she said, after research found it to be a=
=20
good investment.

"I kind of feel like we've been used for political reasons," Griffin said.=
=20
"We would have disclosed anything right at first, but they never asked."

As a trader, Griffin said she occasionally bought Calpine power for the=20
state, but only at market prices.

Meanwhile, two Democratic political consultants, who helped Davis polish hi=
s=20
image after the ongoing energy crisis caused his poll numbers to plummet,=
=20
have agreed to accept no payment for their work as part of an out-of-court=
=20
settlement of a taxpayer lawsuit.

Tom Hiltachk, a lawyer for conservative anti-tax activist Lewis Uhler, said=
=20
the settlement was reached last Friday after negotiations with lawyers for=
=20
communications consultants Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane.

"Now they will not receive one red cent," said Hiltachk. "Very simply Mr.=
=20
Fabiani and Mr. Lehane have agreed to cease all activities for the governor=
,=20
to accept no payments for their services and to basically get out of the=20
consulting business with the governor."

As his part of the agreement, Hiltachk said, Uhler withdrew his lawsuit=20
Monday morning.

Uhler had filed a lawsuit against the two consultants and Controller Kathle=
en=20
Connell in June contending that they should not receive any payments becaus=
e=20
of a conflict of interest. The two men also did consulting work for=20
financially troubled Southern California Edison, which was seeking help fro=
m=20
Davis and the Legislature.

Connell, a former Los Angeles mayoral candidate who has been at odds with=
=20
Davis since he endorsed an opponent, had held up the payments pending the=
=20
outcome of the lawsuit.

Under an agreement with Davis, the men were to have been paid $30,000 a mon=
th=20
for six months.

Fabiani and Lehane could not be reached for comment.

PG&E Corp. said yesterday that it will earn $500 million to $600 million mo=

than anticipated in the second quarter because its bankrupt utility was abl=

to buy cheaper electricity in March as wholesale prices dropped.=20

"Its a good thing for PG&E," said Paul Fremont, an energy industry analyst=

Thomson Financial/First Call, an investment research firm.=20
PG&E Corp. is the owner of Pacific Gas & Electric Co., which filed for=20
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April after electricity prices soared=

this year. The utility had previously estimated that it lost $1.1 billion i=
n=20
the first quarter and $4.1 billion in the fourth because it was prohibited =
by=20

PG&E Corp. also includes a energy producing unit, which generally makes=20

the utility's bankruptcy.=20
The utility said it got a small break in March as the price it was paying t=

the California Independent System Operator for energy declined sharply. The=

unanticipated drop was attributed to declining demand because of energy=20
conservation, low tempera-=20
tures and the opening of new power plants in the state.=20
The utility also benefited from the cancellation of power contracts by=20
companies that did not want to do business with a bankrupt partner. Those=

GOV. GRAY DAVIS seems to have an ethical blind spot when it comes to the=20
hiring of outsiders to help manage California's energy crisis.=20
Throughout the crisis, Davis has been intolerably slow in responding to=20
questions about whether certain members of his inner circle -- drawing big=
=20
checks off the public payroll -- might have possible financial conflicts.=
=20
As of yesterday, the governor's office still has not required 16 contractor=
s=20
to file public disclosure documents that would reveal whether they have any=
=20
financial stake in companies affected by policies they help develop.=20
Steve Maviglio, the governor's press secretary, said 42 energy "consultants=
"=20
have filed their economic disclosure statements. But he said the other 16=
=20
were "contractors" -- without actual decisionmaking authority -- and were=
=20
thus not required to fill out the forms.=20
Maviglio's "contractor versus consultant" distinctions are technical and=20
semantic. His spin simply doesn't wash.=20
The bottom line is that "contractors" who are making big decisions involvin=
g=20
big dollars for the state are not playing by the same rules as others in th=
e=20
public trust.=20
For example, Davis has exempted two Wall Street executives, Joseph Fichera=
=20
and Michael Hoffman, who are putting together a rescue plan that involves a=
=20
$12.5 billion bond issue. They are getting $275,000 a month for their advic=
e.=20
Yet they have not been required to fill out disclosure forms, which would=
=20
allow the governor -- and any other Californian -- to assess whether a=20
potential conflict exists.=20
"They told us they don't have any conflicts," said Maviglio, who,=20
incidentally, confirmed yesterday that in June he bought $12,000 worth of=
=20
stock in the Calpine Corp., the generating company with the largest chunk o=
f=20
state power contracts. On July 2, Davis publicly praised Calpine as "the mo=
st=20
responsible of the generators."=20
Davis should have finally learned his lesson last week after having to fire=
=20
five consultants -- all involved in energy trading -- when their belatedly=
=20
filed disclosure forms showed serious potential conflicts. A sixth consulta=
nt=20
quit. Four of those traders owned Calpine shares.=20
A week earlier, the Davis administration was forced to order a group of=20
consultants to hastily unload their power-company holdings or lose their=20
contracts.=20
The governor's office also has been stung by revelations that political=20
consultants Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani, hired at $30,000 a month to=20
develop energy-related "communications strategies," also had a contract wit=
h=20
Southern California Edison.=20
Moreover, some of the disclosure forms that have been filed to date have be=
en=20
less than complete, especially regarding the timing of the buying and selli=
ng=20
of energy stocks.=20
How many scandals will it take for Davis to insist on full disclosure -- an=

On the surface, things seem to be going pretty good for Gov. Gray Davis wit=

optimistic picture lie troubling problems. For example, Davis's argument th=

out-of-state power generators are responsible for the electricity crisis ha=

been falling apart. For months, Davis has been claiming that private=20
generators have overcharged California by $8.9 billion and demanded that th=

amount be refunded to the state. However, after a two-week mediation betwee=
n=20
state officials and the generators, Curtis Wagner, the federal government's=
=20
chief energy regulatory judge, rebuked Davis's claim saying that such a hug=
e=20
overcharge "has not and cannot be substantiated." Further, while the=20
generators may be liable to refund a much smaller amount to the state,=20
perhaps $1 billion, Wagner said that generators are owed more money by the=
=20
state than they owe the state in refunds: "Can a cash refund be required=20
where a much larger amount is due the seller? The chief judge thinks not."=
=20
Davis reacted to the judge's ruling by calling it a "raw deal" and by urgin=
g=20
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to ignore the lack of evidence and=

the judge's conclusions and to "step up and provide the refunds we've asked=

for." Davis's position, as usual, is motivated purely by politics. Indeed,=
=20
Dan Walters of the Sacramento Bee says that Davis is operating in a=20
"melodramatic virtual world" de-linked from reality.=20
Davis's blame-the-generators argument took another body blow when newly=20

generators. For example, while Texas-based Enron, a favorite Davis whipping=
=20
boy, charged an average $181 per megawatt hour, SMUD charged an average $33=
0=20
per megawatt hour.=20
Davis responded to this revelation in typical political fashion. A Davis=20
spokesman said that the governor had expressed his anger at "the generators=

Yet, for all Davis' feigned indignation about consumers being ripped off, i=

SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- For the past seven months, Gov. Gray Davis has begged=
,=20
cajoled and even threatened legislators and regulators, to lay the groundwo=
rk=20
for a $12.5 billion bond issue California needs to cover the cost of keepin=
g=20
its lights on.=20
Now comes the tough part: persuading investors that the bond is an attracti=
ve=20
investment. On that score, Mr. Davis's team, whose credibility has been=20
battered by California's months-long electricity crisis, is hoping to bounc=
e=20
back from a rocky start.=20
This week, a delegation headed by state Treasurer Philip Angelides is=20
scheduled to visit Wall Street to pitch the municipal debt offering, which=
=20
would be the largest in U.S. history by a factor of nearly four. To succeed=
,=20
Mr. Angelides will have to allay investors' fears of the kind of political=
=20
infighting that already has delayed the issue several times. He will have t=
o=20
satisfy bond-rating agencies that the bond is safe enough to merit a top-ti=
er=20
investment-grade rating. And he'll have to make investors want to buy it=20
without demanding costly inducements that would give California financial=
=20
headaches for decades to come.=20
"This isn't building the Panama Canal. It's not Apollo 11," says Mr.=20
Angelides. But, he concedes, the bond sale will be "uniquely challenging."=
=20
That is because this giant bond issue won't be backed by the full faith and=
=20
credit of the state or by tax dollars -- the types of guarantees public-deb=
t=20
investors often prefer. Instead, the bonds, which will have maturities of a=
s=20
long as 15 years, are to be paid off by the state's electricity ratepayers=
=20
from their monthly bills, which some view as a riskier source of cash flow.=
=20
Moreover, there is still a question as to whether the issue's proceeds will=
=20
be adequate to repay the bonds, restore the state's financially troubled=20
private utilities to health and finance future electricity purchases.=20
Despite these hurdles, many analysts predict California will eventually=20
succeed in pulling off the bond deal, though at a cost far higher than=20
originally anticipated. In fact, the apparent easing of the state's energy=
=20
crunch may make its marketing job a bit less difficult. A recent drop in th=
e=20
price of natural gas, which fuels many California power plants, a mild summ=
er=20
in the West and a June decision by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission=
=20
to impose electricity price caps in the region have helped avert the rollin=
g=20
blackouts that roiled the state earlier this year.=20
Still, the specter of history overhangs the bond offering. Rating agencies=
=20
are haunted by having failed to warn investors of such public-finance=20
disasters as the 1983 default of the Washington Public Power Supply System=
=20
and the 1994 bankruptcy of Orange County, Calif. Moreover, Moody's Investor=
s=20
Service and Standard & Poor's assigned investment-grade ratings as recently=

By the time California hopes to sell its bonds, in October or early Novembe=
r,=20
the state's electrical-power purchases are expected to leave it owing a tot=
al=20
of about $10 billion to its lenders and its own general fund. If the bond=

California could be forced to make billions of dollars in spending cuts,=20
raise taxes or increase electricity rates for the third time in the past ye=

to pay back what it owes.=20
If the bond sale fails "the state of California will be in deep trouble,"=
=20
says Mr. Angelides. "The state general fund must be repaid so money for=20
education, health care and children's services can be safe."=20
California's need for the bonds -- like most of the state's energy woes --=
=20
stems from its troubled 1996 electricity-deregulation plan. Under the plan,=
=20
the state's investor-owned utilities were obliged to sell many of their pow=
er=20
plants to other companies and purchase electricity through a state-sponsore=
d=20
power auction. Consumer rates were frozen, but wholesale rates weren't.=20
The system worked fairly well until May 2000, when wholesale rates began=20
soaring amid tight electricity supplies and stronger-than-expected demand.=
=20
Last year, the state's cost of wholesale power climbed to $27 billion from =
$7=20
billion in 1999. In the first six months of this year, that sum hit $20=20
billion.=20
With retail rates frozen, Pacific Gas & Electric, a unit of PG&E Corp., and=
=20
Edison International's Southern California Edison racked up billions of=20
dollars of debts. In January, after power generators stopped doing business=
=20
with the utilities, the state began buying power on their behalf. It borrow=
ed=20
the money from its general fund, normally used to pay for everything from=
=20
public safety and environmental programs to social services and education, =
at=20
a pace of more than $1 billion a month.=20
In February, Mr. Davis's allies in the state Legislature helped him pass a=
=20
bill authorizing the state to sell bonds to replenish the fund and to=20
continue making power purchases. But legislators cautiously capped the size=
=20
of the borrowing, using a complex formula. Under the new law, the formula=
=20
would allow only for a bond sale of less than $1 billion.=20
Realizing that wasn't sufficient, the governor and the assembly drafted=20
another bill that scrapped the formula and allowed the state to sell up to=
=20
$13.4 billion of bonds. But, in a setback for Mr. Davis, Republican lawmake=
rs=20
banded together to deny him the two-thirds majority needed for the bill to=
=20
immediately become law. As a result, the law won't take effect until=20
mid-August, when the public-finance market is all but moribund.=20
In the meantime, Mr. Angelides moved to hire underwriters. After receiving=
=20
four dozen bids from Wall Street investment bankers in February, he retaine=
d=20
a team led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. But under pressure to get the financi=
ng=20
moving, the treasurer didn't negotiate firm underwriting fees on the deal.=
=20
At the time, Mr. Angelides said he expected the underwriters to "skinny dow=
n"=20
their fees given the enormous size of the offering. But Morgan, representin=
g=20
a team of underwriters that includes Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., Citgrou=
p=20
Inc.'s Salomon Smith Barney unit and Bear, Stearns & Co., says it expects t=
o=20
charge standard fees, given the significant challenges presented by the=20
issue's size. In the case of a $12.5 billion sale, that amounts to around $=
56=20
million. J.P. Morgan and the California treasurer's office now say the fees=
=20
won't be decided until they determine the bond issue's final size and=20
structure.=20
From the start, relations between California officials and Wall Street seem=
ed=20
fraught with miscommunication. In February, Mr. Davis called a meeting to=
=20
explain to institutional investors, analysts and rating-agency executives h=
is=20
blueprint for getting a grip on California's energy crisis. The session, hi=
s=20
only face-to-face meeting with investors to date, was held at Manhattan's=
=20
Cornell Club. Attendees say the governor kept them waiting for 20 minutes=
=20
before breezing into the room and giving them only a general overview of th=
e=20
state's energy plan, which left investors grumbling.=20
During the discussion, Mr. Davis, a Bronx, N.Y., native, made light of a=20
conversation he had had with Richard Cortright Jr., a Standard & Poor's=20
director. "I told him: `You're from Indiana, that explains why you're not=
=20
getting it,'" the governor said, according to several people present.=20
"It was intended as a joke, but no one was laughing," says A.J. Sabatelle, =
a=20
Moody's vice president. A spokesman for Mr. Davis says the governor doesn't=
=20
recall the exchange; Mr. Davis is frequently late for public engagements. A=
=20
spokesman for Mr. Cortright wouldn't comment.=20
Then, in March, the governor's office set up a conference call to update=20
investors. Figuring they wouldn't get a big turnout, they used an open-mike=
=20
system that allowed each investor's comments to be heard by everyone else.=
=20
But with around 100 investors taking part, the presentation by Joseph=20
Fichera, a paid consultant who is one of Mr. Davis's top financial advisers=
,=20
turned into a free-for-all, with one caller cursing Mr. Fichera in response=
=20
to one of his answers.=20
Infighting among California politicians hasn't helped. Earlier this year, f=
or=20
example, state Controller Kathleen Connell criticized the way her fellow=20
Democrats, Messrs. Davis and Angelides, were handling the bond sale. Unless=
=20
it was far bigger, she warned, the state would face a "cash-flow crunch" by=
=20
February or March of 2002. The governor's office fired back, calling her=20
claims "completely" political.=20
California policy makers have "spent most of the year bickering and finger=
=20
pointing," Standard & Poor's director Peter Rigby said in a recent report,=
=20
"and that will raise some uncertainty among lenders." Moreover, investors=
=20
know the state needs the money, and so "it's a buyer's market," Mr. Rigby=
=20
added.=20
Aware that it needed a financial pro to make its case to Wall Street, the=
=20
Davis Administration pushed Mr. Fichera to the forefront. Since May, the=20
former Prudential Securities investment banker has spent hours on conferenc=
e=20
calls with Wall Street explaining the state's strategy. That and a sense th=
at=20
California has gotten a better grip on its electricity woes indicates that=
=20
"the governor's staff is far higher on the learning curve than just a few=
=20
months ago," says Paul Patterson, an electric-power analyst at ABN Amro Inc=
.=20
Critical barriers remain. The state's Public Utilities Commission has yet t=
o=20
make key decisions intended to ensure that there's enough ratepayer revenue=
=20
set aside to guarantee that bondholders get paid. On Aug. 23, for example,=
=20
the PUC is expected to take up a rate agreement giving the state's power=20
purchaser, the Department of Water Resources, unprecedented authority to=20
raise rates without a public hearing. The commission also is expected to=20
decide how to divvy up current ratepayer revenue among state and private=20
utilities and to take up a measure that would prohibit large industrial=20
consumers from, in effect, bypassing the utilities and buying their juice=
=20
directly from generators or traders.=20
But opponents of those controversial measures are expected to put up a figh=
t.=20
Businesses and consumer groups are particularly upset that the state might=
=20
get carte blanche to raise rates and are threatening to sue to block the PU=
C=20
decision before the state Supreme Court.=20
California already has some of the highest electricity rates in the nation.=
=20
Residential consumers in San Francisco, for instance, pay around 14 cents p=
er=20
kilowatt hour for power, up from about 10 cents in December. That compares=
=20
with around seven cents per kilowatt hour in Atlanta and 10 cents in Chicag=
o,=20
but it is still lower than the nearly 23 cents charged in New York City.=20
High costs are a big reason businesses think they ought to be free to buy=

electricity directly. It's not "in the best interest of consumers to=20

electricity in California higher than necessary for at least 10 years," say=
s=20
Allan Zaremberg, president of the California Chamber of Commerce.=20
The state's three largest investor-owned utilities, PG&E, SoCalEd and Sempr=
a=20
Energy's San Diego Gas & Electric Co., are expected to demand the largest=
=20
possible share of the revenues they collect from ratepayers. PG&E, for=20
example, has already asked for a public hearing to examine the state's clai=
m=20
that it needs so much money. The pressure to allocate more cash to the=20
utilities could also rise if a state-sponsored bailout plan for SoCalEd fai=
ls=20
and the utility joins PG&E in bankruptcy proceedings.=20
Sorting all these issues out before the PUC may lead to legal challenges th=

another nagging concern: Under a $43 billion series of long-term power=20
contracts signed by the state, electricity generators and traders involved=

get first call on revenue from ratepayers. Only then would bondholders, who=

are accustomed to being first in line, get paid.=20
In fact, some investors who were initially enthusiastic about a bond that i=

of=20
Envision Capital in Los Angeles, a firm that manages bond portfolios for=20
individual investors, says she spent several months setting aside money to=

participate in the deal. Now, she says, she is starting to look elsewhere. =
"I=20
don't have confidence that it will get done," she adds.=20
Many investors are concerned the state hasn't proved it can overcome its=20

says Kelly Mainelli, a portfolio manager at Montgomery Asset Management in=
=20
San Francisco, who is considering investing in the bonds. He says he also=
=20
worries about a spike in natural gas prices ahead of the offering.=20
To reassure potential investors, the state now is offering to amass a $3=20
billion reserve -- from bond proceeds and ratepayer revenues -- to ensure=
=20
that bondholders would get paid in the event of any unforeseen developments=
=20
in the power market. In addition, California lawmakers are moving a bill=20
through the Legislature that would set aside a specific portion of revenues=

from ratepayers solely to pay bondholders. Such an approach could help the=

The five-to-20-year power contracts signed in a panic by the Davis=20

Now, Gov. Gray Davis' spin doctors want us to believe that these $43-billio=

long-term contracts were both necessary and the impetus for a moderating=20
energy market. Here's the real story:=20
Last summer, under a flawed deregulation, a handful of large out-of-state=
=20
generators effectively cornered California 's wholesale electricity market.=
=20
This "sellers cartel" first drained our electric utilities dry. In November=
,=20
it became the taxpayers' turn to be victimized, when the Davis administrati=
on=20
gave carte blanche authority to the Department of Water Resources for energ=
y=20
purchases. Between November and July, the department burned through $8=20

budget surplus. This required the state Public Utilities Commission to pass=
=20
the largest rate hike in California history and will require the state to=
=20
issue $12.4 billion in bonds this fall to service this debt.=20
In February, with spot market prices at all-time highs and rolling blackout=
s=20
rippling through the state, the governor's representatives began to negotia=
te=20
long-term contracts with the sellers cartel. This was an ill-advised=20
long-term strategy to fight a short-run crisis. To understand why, look at=
=20
the negotiating chessboard from the electricity cartel's perspective. The=
=20
cartel's negotiators knew that within 18 to 24 months, there would be a hug=
e=20
glut of power on the market as many power plants were already under=20
construction in California and throughout the West. Once the new energy=20
resources were available, the cartel would no longer be able to manipulate=
=20
the market. This supply glut would drive prices back to the 1999 range of=
=20
three to five cents per kilowatt-hour, far lower than the prices now set in=
=20
the long-term energy contracts.=20
To the cartel members, this looming power glut was a recipe for heavy losse=
s.=20
Locking the state into long-term contracts at lucrative rates was their=20
redemption. The Davis administration walked into this market inferno,=20
bargaining from extreme weakness at the top of the market, signing contract=
s=20
that were too expensive. The administration also capitulated on two highly=
=20
objectionable clauses. The first requires the state to absorb all costs of=
=20
environmental protection for many of the generators. The second holds the=
=20
generators "harmless" for any increase in taxes imposed on the generators b=
y=20
the state. This provision essentially freezes taxes on the generators over=
=20
the next several years, requiring taxpayers to pick up the tab.=20
Notwithstanding the administration's spin, the current improvement in our=
=20
energy situation may be traced to at least four other factors: This summer=
=20
has been unusually cool, Californians have increased their conservation,=20
recessionary forces have reduced demand and, most important, the Federal=20
Energy Regulatory Commission finally imposed price caps on the sellers=20
cartel, dampening market manipulation.=20
The bottom line is this: Long after the rolling blackouts stop, California=
=20
still will be saddled with billions of dollars of unnecessary electricity=
=20
costs and high bond debt. These higher costs will hurt consumers and=20
businesses, put heavy pressure on the state budget for years and inhibit th=

There are two lessons from this multibillion-dollar mistake. The first is t=

Electrical Switch: Now, Cheaper Power
Is Causing Hefty Losses for California=20
By Rebecca Smith

07/31/2001=20
The Wall Street Journal=20
Page A3=20
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)=20
Mild weather means that California is escaping blackouts, but it also means=
=20
that the state is amassing power-trading losses that are adding to the cost=
=20
of an energy mess now in its 15th month.=20
Internal documents show that so far in July, California has resold the=20
equivalent of 8% of the power it bought under short-term and long-term=20
contracts that were designed to reduce the state's reliance on the volatile=
=20
and costly spot market. The problem is, the state has had a surfeit of powe=
r,=20
and it has been selling the juice into the market at a fraction of the pric=
e=20
it paid, leading to losses from July 1 through Thursday of about $30 millio=
n=20
to $35 million.=20
The losses illustrate the difficulties dogging the state's new energy czar,=
=20
the California Department of Water Resources, despite a softening of=20
electricity prices and demand. The department got into the power-purchasing=
=20
business in a big way in January, when the state's biggest investor-owned=
=20
utilities quit buying power because they were no longer creditworthy. Since=
=20
then, the state has signed $43 billion worth of contracts, one for as much =
as=20
20 years, in a bid to tamp down high spot-market prices. Critics now say it=
=20
was a mistake to lock in so much power at such a high cost.=20
Power officials say the state has been in the odd position since last month=
=20
of having too much power contracted for off-peak hours. "It's something you=
'd=20
expect when you first get into a new business and you'd hope to reduce it,"=
=20
said Pete Garris, chief of operations for the power-purchasing agency.=20
Internal numbers from the DWR, which the agency has confirmed, show that on=
=20
average the state paid, from July 1 to Thursday, $123 per megawatt hour for=
=20
some 1.8 million megawatts of power purchased under long-term contracts, an=
d=20
$148 per megawatt hour for some 2.2 million megawatt hours of power purchas=
ed=20
under short-term contracts. In the same period, the records show it sold=20
excess power amounting to 320,000 megawatt hours at an average price of $27=
=20
per megawatt hour, less than what it costs to fuel many plants. At times, t=
he=20
DWR sold the juice for as little as $2 per megawatt hour.=20
This, ironically, has offered an opportunity to power traders that the stat=
e=20
was seeking to hem in through its contract program. They have been able at=
=20
times to substitute cheap power they buy from the state for the more costly=
=20
power they otherwise would have to generate to meet their contract=20
obligations.=20
Despite the agency's power-trading losses, total market costs still are dow=
n=20
substantially from previous months, partly due to price limits set June 19 =
by=20
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Slacker demand also has been a=20
factor. In June, Southern California Edison, a unit of Edison International=
,=20
sold 11.8% less electricity to its customers than in June 2000, reflecting=
=20
energy conservation and reduced demand for air conditioning.=20
Since January the state has spent $9.5 billion buying power at an average=
=20
cost of $237 per megawatt hour, according to internal DWR documents. That i=
s=20
more than double the price of wholesale electricity last year, when prices=
=20
averaged $114. The state's cash-strapped utilities have reimbursed the agen=
cy=20
$1.53 billion of the $9.5 billion it has spent so far. As a result of the=
=20
huge shortfall, the state has tapped California 's general fund and now is=
=20
pursuing a plan to sell $12.5 billion worth of revenue bonds to replenish i=
ts=20
coffers.=20
The state signed dozens of long-term power contracts after January, pushed =
by=20
federal energy regulators to protect itself against spot-market volatility.=
=20
So far this year, it has spent $851 million under long-term contracts, $2.3=
6=20
billion under short-term arrangements and $5.54 billion on spot-market=20
purchases, according to the DWR documents.=20
