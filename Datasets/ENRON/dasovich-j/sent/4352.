Don't have my car here.  Planned on taking BART, but if possible, might be 
useful to carpool--give us additional time to discuss the presentation.  I'm 
game.

Best,
Jeff

Haven't heard from Mark yet... Am waiting to hear before 
printing and emailing to Tasker...   

Mark, Jeff: Are any of you driving over to campus from
the city?

Looks great to me (although the slide animation did not work on my machine
so I can't comment on that)!

If we are all in agreement, someone needs to e-mail Sarah a copy and print
one out for her.  Can you do that Anil once you get an okay from Jeff and
Mark?  Thanks for all the hard work.

See everyone around 5:30pm in Jimmy Bean's.

Hi Team,

Here's the final cut. 

I added hyperlinks to DCF sheets in backup as well as to 
trading comps and deal comps in the backup. And animation
for slide turns. 

Also, be sure to preview the 3-legged stool slide I added 
after valuations in slide presentation mode with sound 
enabled... Totally OK to remove it if any of you don't like 
it...

Any Qs, call me on my cell: 916 600 1245.
