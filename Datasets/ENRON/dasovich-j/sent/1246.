good point.  if you'd like to include it in this draft, i'm fine with 
that---we certainly have been very vocal about the need to reform it.  
alternatively, we could discuss with the larger group tomorrow whether we 
weigh in heavily and if so what our exact message ought to be.  either way 
works for me, just let me know.
