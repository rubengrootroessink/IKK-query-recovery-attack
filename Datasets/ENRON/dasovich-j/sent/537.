Well, wouldn't you know it.  I couldn't find the most recent version in my 
email.  But here's the 10.03 version with a few edits.  Couple of other 
points:

I still very much like the idea of taking the table out and includling as an 
attachment.
I still think that the table doesn't explicitly address an option Rick may be 
thinking about "Maintain presence with fewer resources."  Think it's 
something we need to focus on.  

Have a great weekend.

Spreadsheet to follow.
