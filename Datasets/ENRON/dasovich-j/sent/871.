Wayne:  If you insist, we can pass on Thanksgiving.  

Others:  Any problems with changing the meeting to Thursdays?  If the 
meetings are going to continue on a weekly basis, I'd like to try to attend 
in person as much as possible (i.e., schedule permitting).  Currently, my 
schedule doesn't permit me to be in Houstons on Wednesday mornings.  But 
Thursdays would work.  If it makes things too complicated, not a problem.

Best,
Jeff

Thursdays would be OK by me provided that we don't have to meet on 
Thanksgiving.

Greetings Wayne:

Sorry that I missed the last meeting.  I'll be attending by phone this week, 
but would like to attend in person as often as I can (understanding that our 
meetings will be weekly).  Now don't shoot me, but I was wondering if it 
might be possible to have the meetings on Thursday mornings.  That way I 
could actually be in Houston for the meetings (which my schedule doesn't 
permit me to do on Wednesdays).  If it's too complicated, don't sweat it; I 
can continue to do the meetings by phone.  But if Thursdays can fit into 
folks' schedule, that would be great.  Thanks and talk to you on Wednesday.

Best,
Jeff
