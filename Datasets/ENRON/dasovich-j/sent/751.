Yes, 9:35 would be better.  Thanks for asking.

Best,

DELETE IF NOT A BART SHUTTLE RIDER.

A BART shuttle rider recently suggested that the shuttle leave 5 minutes
earlier (9:35 pm rather than 9:40 pm) to accommodate the BART schedule.
Apparently, the extra five minutes gets students to the station just
shortly after BART leaves, causing students to wait until the next train
20 minutes later.

If you a BART shuttle rider, please provide me some feedback.

Thanks,

Diane
