We'll send a card.  She's 19?  Well, if we have to, we'll take some 
tomotoes.....Taking the suit and (if Prentice permits) Annie, too.  

Could you discuss with Eldon whether you guys want to do the Dome road while 
my is doing my road at the end of the month?   He's going to fax me the 
estimate based on his visit when we were all up there last.  To be honest, 
the deck's got me pretty darned gun-shy about "projects" and this guy is 
really nice and I want to work with him for years to come.  He's pretty 
willing to do whatever you folks want, i.e., from Yugo-style road to Rolls 
Royce-style road.  And if you want to take a pass, that's of course great, 
too.  I just want to make sure it doesn't turn in to a 
cluster-you-know-what....Just let me know.

I don't know if Prentice will get the e-mail, Jeff - so could you try to help 
make sure this happens.? Sunday is Amber's birthday.? Since we will be at the 
Cubs game it would be great if you guys could send her a card.

When you come to get your stuff, take all the tomatoes you want with you!? 
Are you going to take Annie?
