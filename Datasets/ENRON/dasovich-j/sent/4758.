You need to worry less about Cameron, because I think that it's one of those 
very deeply rooted Mom/daughter things, and will take time to work out.  

And I sense a phase that she's going through that is just like the one that 
my older sister went through with my Mom around the same age (which I wasn't 
particularly happy about, but I think it's normal, sort of).  I'd be happy to 
talk about it if you want some time.  

I think part of it is going to be that primordial thing where she's starting 
her own gig with Scott and it's going to be like a second "breaking away" 
(the one that comes after teen-age-dom).  So it's less about you and much 
more about her (and Scott, to some degree, too).  

I hope I'm not confusing matters more.   

Hugs,
Jeff

Payback is hell for loving ribbing.  Of course I love it - I just wish
someone could tell me how to stop making Cameron so angry!  My face is fine
thank you.

Yeah, tell me about it.   (Payback for what!?!?)

So that means you DON'T enjoy my loving ribbing?

P.S. My butt still feels like there's all these rubberbands wrapped around
it......(:

So you packed up our entire car and left all your stuff - what a concept.

Payback is hell.

The bad news is I left my bag with clothes and toiletries at the Dome.  The
good news is it's a great excuse to have to go up again this weekend!

Thanks again for everything.  Really nice with only the
principals---smaller, more intimate, less mess---and the ping pong table is
a HUGE hit.

I hope you enjoy my loving ribbing as much as I enjoy yours.

Best,
Jeff
