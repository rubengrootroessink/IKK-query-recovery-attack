Tyson has gotten a call-back from the governor's office.  She's going to call 
him back shortly to try to sell him on the plan (i.e., private sector to the 
rescue) and ensure that he'll come to the party.  She'll call me back as soon 
as she talks to him.

Curious--do we have any sense of whether there's much activity within the 
adminstration on this, or can we expect the wait and see approach to continue?
Best,
Jeff
