Margaret:  Congratulations.  Sounds very exciting.  You will be sorely, 
sorely missed.  Your family's (immense) gain is Enron's loss. It's been an 
incredible pleasure working with you.

Best,
Jeff

		 Subject: M. CARSON IS LOOKING FORWARD TO RETIRING SOON

Hi to my  friends and  associates here at Enron!!!  After  14  great  years  
at  Enron I am retiring soon to spend  time  with my husband and family  and 
to have more  time to  travel,  to  do   watercolor paintings  and  work on 
my art website.

For general referrals on  energy information that you may need  that  I have 
been providing,  please call Joan Stransky   and  she  can assist you in 
finding  alternate sources for this information. For information related to  
competition and state restructuring updates  kindly contact  Elizabeth 
Linnell in Enron Government  Affairs.   For  Cambridge Energy Research 
Associates Contract matters  please  call Jim Steffes.  On  Enron executive 
and officers speech matters kindly call Rob Bradley.  Kindly  contact Joan if 
you need  assistance  with gaining  access  to the CERA  research documents 
we obtain under our Corporate  License  agreement.   On queries covering  
international  data, please  contact  Fiona  Grant in our London Office.  

 
 I have   enjoyed working with you all  here  at Enron and I wish you all the 
best.  Regards,  Margaret
