Can you define "off line?"  You mean they're going to "island' themselves, no 
longer taking power from the grid? To get the standby service, they'll need 
to sign an agreement under PG&E's standby tariffs (the tariff for cogens if 
the cogens getting the standby, or for the University, if UC's taking the 
standby).
