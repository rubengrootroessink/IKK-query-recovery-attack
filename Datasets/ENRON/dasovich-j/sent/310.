Immensely helpful.  Thanks so much.  That's all I'll need.  FYI.  My plane 
lands at 12:20 and I'll be going directly to the Woodlands.  Oh, one thing.  
If you could get info to Joseph on where the Woodlands is and where I need to 
go once I arrive there, I'd be eternally indebted.

Best,
Jeff

I am in the process of putting something together right now.  It looks like 
the meeting will begin tomorrow at 1pm and continue through the evening (if 
necessary).  Rick has only made arrangements for the one day (Tuesday).  I do 
not have an agenda, but Rick and Jim have asked that a notebook be put 
together with information (e:mails, attachments, etc...) from way back when 
to the present.  Also, just FYI, I have made arrangements for a deli lunch to 
be provided in the room beginning at 12:30pm.  (detailed e:mail to follow)

I hope this helps and please call me if you have any questions.

Subject: Tomorrow's Meeting at the Woodlands

Hi:
Hope you had a nice weekend.  Sorry I missed you all in Washington.  Rick's 
asked me to attend the meeting at the Woodlands tomorrow.  Do we have a list 
of attendants/agenda?  No big deal, but would help me in preparing for the 
meeting.  I'm assuming that the meeting takes place tomorrow only?  I'm 
staying through Wednesday, nonetheless, and have booked a room at the 
Lancaster.  But if the meeting's going to continue through Wed, I was 
wondering if I should be staying at the Woodlands.  Thanks (as always) for 
you help.

Signed,
Clueless
