Forgive the tardiness.  As soon as I come up from air from completing a tidal 
wave of performance reviews, I'll give a full report.  Bottom line:  His 
message is a very good one.  His delivery could use a tad spicing up, 
however.  Unfortunately, when I was free, he was in meetings, and vice 
versa.  So we never got to sit down and chat.  I'll fill you in more soon.

Best,
Jeff
