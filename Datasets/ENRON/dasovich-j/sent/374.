Yes, am aware of it, but there was no attachment (re: PG&E's proposal) in the 
note that I received.  Could someone please forward?  Thanks.

Jess,  what do know about this?  If you have any info let Jeff Nieland 
know.   

Jeff  N.,  I am not familiar with the Cal. EEP.  In most state it is not 
unusual for transmission customer (usually all the  customers are involved)  
to be part of the plans.  Jeff Dasovich or Roger Yang may have more details.

Gentlemen,

Do we have any influence over this issue with our direct access customers in 
California?  IBM San Jose is on an interruptible transmission tariff and is 
concerned about the proposed Mandatory Curtailment Plan.  I would appreciate 
any comments.

Thanks

Jeff

Tom - Who would you recommend asking to comment from our regulatory 
department?

Kumar,

I have distributed the plan to our commodity and regulatory departments for 
comments.  After receiving their comments, I will summarize and forward.  
Please contact me with questions.

Thanks

Jeff,
We are concerned about the impact of the proposed Mandatory Curtailment
Plan.\ (Please see Lynn's Note below)   Please review from a commodity
provider standpoint.  In your opinion, is it fair for us to be subject to
such legislation while we are a Direct Access Customer?

I would appreciate your comments.

Regards,

Kumar

Hi Dan and Tom,

Greetings.  I hope all is well with both of you and PPG.

I recently received information that transmission voltage customers will
likely be required to be involved in the Electric Emergency Plan (EEP)
in the future.  Currently transmission customers are not "required" to
curtail any load when distribution circuits are taken off line as a
result of a Stage 3 EEP operation.

Please take a look at the attachment below and if possible provide
comments to help shape the proposed change.  I will need comments by
this Friday noon if possible.  Thanks for the input.
