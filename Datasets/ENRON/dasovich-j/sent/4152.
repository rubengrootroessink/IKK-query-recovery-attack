Sunday works for me, and we can meet in my office.  But if it's OK, 10 AM 
works better for me.  Let me know.

And Anil has very graciously offered to coordinate the power point 
presentation for the project.  And having worked with Anil on another project 
that required power point, I can vouch that he is at wizard with the 
technology.

Best,
Jeff

I will cancel with Diane for my commitment during Thursday break, so we can
definitely meet then. How does meeting on Sunday morning work for everyone?
Say around 9am-ish?

Our schedules make it messy. I can come over tomorrow during the break if
Anil and Carolyn want to meet. Mark, if you want to hunker down with the
model tomorrow, you sh! ould feel free. The only thing about Thursday is
that Carolyn's got a commitment with Dian. Can we talk about meeting this
weekend? I can be flexible.

Best,
Jeff

Guys,

We are not going to be able to meet during the week since we all have class
every day of the week. We'll have to talk on Thursday and again Sat. or
Sun.
Come prepared so we can be efficient.

Later

Jeff - Thanks for putting so much work into this. Excellent job!

I agree that we should figure out when we can meet again. I can meet
tonight, during break on Tuesday and basically anytime on Saturday or
Sunday. During break on Thursday I volunteered to help Diane with a new
student's reception, but I can cancel that if need be. What does everyone
else's schedule look like?

OK folks. It's about 80% of the way there. My brains are oozing out
looking at cells, so I want to get this around so Mark can get started on
refining assumptions and other folks can examine as well. I'll continue to
check it and de-bug it. Mark, you and I should talk, too. (You'll note
that at this point, the valuation is in the $30s, so there's work to! do.)
Apologies in advance for any errors (and I'm sure they're there).

If anyone has any questions on the model, just let me know.

I think we ought to get together to meet this week as much as possible to
start getting the power point presentation together. And perhaps we should
think about meeting this weekend?

In the meantime, I'm pulling together the data on Buffet (Berkshire
Hathaway) stock performance, etc., and will also do the financial ratios,
including Dupont, for OAT.

Does this work for folks? Other thoughts?

Best,
Jeff
