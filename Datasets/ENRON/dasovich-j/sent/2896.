P.S.  Nice use of "birthday" as the segue to the deal. =20

Speaking of birthdays, Prentice has informed me that, despite my=20
protestations (being a very low-key sort of guy), there "must" be some part=
y=20
for my birthday this year (which I'm still opposed to--and I may be in=20
Houston that MONTH anyway). =20

I was thinking (cuz I hate spotlights), that it might be fun and interestin=
g,=20
since your Dad and I are both hitting interesting birthdays this year, if w=
e=20
had a joint party---double the people, double the fun.  (I don't know if he=
'd=20
rather have a solo party for his, though.)  And since my dad's met your dad=
,=20
but our mom's ain't been in the mix,  I though it might be a good (and=20
hopefully safe) atmosphere to get them together in. =20

Am I smoking crack on the whole idea?

Sorry for surprising you this morning!!  Nothing wrong with being
comfortable in your birthday suit.

Speaking of birthdays, I think we should have a goal to get my company
acquired by your company by May 30, 2001.  Good goal, huh??

I want to talk to you about the details I have been thinking about while yo=
u
were gone.  When should we talk??  Let=01,s set up a meeting so we make sur=
e to
move this all forward.

Welcome back.
