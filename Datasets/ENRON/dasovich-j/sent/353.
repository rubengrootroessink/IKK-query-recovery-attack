Kim:  

Been having horrible computer problems.  (Just got switched over to Windows 
2000---I hate Microsoft; break it up into a million itty bitty pieces.)  

Haven't had a chance to read what you wrote.  Attaching what I cobbled 
together yesterday.  Will also take a look at what Mr. Jackson put together.  
You should feel free to go ahead and meld mine and yours, etc.  I'm at work.  
Will be here until  about 11-11:30.  After that, if you need me, page me at 
888.916.7184.  And thanks a million for pulling it together.

Best,
Jeff
