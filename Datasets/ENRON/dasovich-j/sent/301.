Here's my cut at #3.  I haven't had the benefit of Kim's answer, but made 
some assumptions and took a shot.  Likely to doctor it up a bit, but wanted 
to find out if folks are in agreement or if you think I've lost my mind.  Let 
me know.  #3 is somewhat at the heart of the questions, so I want to make 
sure that I get your feedback.  And my apologies for not having gotten you 
something sooner.  Be on the look out, there is a cold going around that 
really kicked my butt over the last week.

Best,
Jeff
