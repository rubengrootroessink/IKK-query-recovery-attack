Honey, I really want to come, but my homework is due to my group tonite and I 
haven't even started it.  I love you tons and hope you understand.  

Please call your mom.  She was a pain on the phone today, saying there's no 
need to remove the stumps at the dome.  Jeff's willing to do ALL THREE for 
$350.  It's just ridiculous and I am having a hard time haggling anymore. 

 I love you tons.  And if you want to talk more about dinner, please call 
me.  I'm sorry, but there's just too darned much to do.  (I think my cold's 
getting worse, not better.  :(
