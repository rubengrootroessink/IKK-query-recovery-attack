OK gang, she's hell bent, and I've spent about as much time as I'm willing on 
this.  Sorry about the hassle---Jimmie, if you hadn't used that colorful 
language, we wouldn't be in this mess.  Anyway, unless I hear strong protests 
in the next 30 minutes, I'm writing back to say she can join (and has to do 
the next case all by her lonesome on the team's behalf as payback).  Lemme 
know.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff,

I appreciate your help. I sent a note to the Prof last week letting him know 
your
concerns and asking him to verify once more that a group size of 5 was OK. I 
got
his response today that it was. Apparently, my old group was the only one 
with 3,
most of the others have at least 4. If there really is a lot of resistance I 
will
ask the Professor to assign me randomly to a group. I would simply prefer to 
join
one that I chose. I appreciate you're group's helping me out of this awkward 
spot,
if they decide to let me in. Let me know,

Thanks,
Christine
