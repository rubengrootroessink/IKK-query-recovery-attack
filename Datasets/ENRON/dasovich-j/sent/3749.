Marty:  Thanks for the information.

Getting Eric's contact information to Alpert's office is in motion.  
Regarding attempt to follow-up with those who called Alpert's office to 
complain, I wasn't clear on that action.  Likely makes sense for Eric to 
coordinate with Sandi to make the contact with Alpert's office.  
Letters are an attempt to influence Alpert to 1) fix the Direct Access 
prohibition and 2) ensure that DA customers don't get saddled with the DWR 
costs.

Let me know if this approach works.

Best,
Jeff

All I asked Eric to do was:
ensure that there was an Enron contact if another complaint came in.
find out from Alpert's office if we could call back a few of those who called 
to complain to find out what they perceived, correct the misperception, 
apologize.

Thanks, Scott. 

Scott/Hedy/Sandi/Bev:  Erik Letke heads up the retail marketing effort 
underway in San Diego.  Marty Sunde wants Alpert to have an EES commercial 
contact that she can talk to in the event she has further questions, etc., 
He'd like Erki to be the contact person.  Erik could you copy your vitals 
(title, contact info) to Scott and Hedy Govenar and Sandi McCubbin so they 
can forward along to Alpert?

Erik, seems that it would be useful if the customer letters to Alpert could 
make the following points (folks please weigh in and add/subtract/modify if 
needed):

The customer's glad to have had the option to take Direct Access service from 
Enron because having the opportunity to take advantage of the offer has made 
the customer better off.
Direct Access is an extremely important option that customers need, want and 
should have going forward.
Any "solution" that the Legislature comes up with must therefore include the 
continuation of Direct Access for all customers.
As such, the Legislature should immediately fix AB 1X to make sure that 
Direct Access remains a permanent fixture of California's energy strategy.
Direct Access customers should not be forced to pay for DWR's power purchase 
costs, since Direct Access customers aren't benefitting from those purchases.

Best,
Jeff
