I'll forward the piece to Brulte via email and offer to meet with him when 
I'm in Sacramento on Monday, or have a phone call with him before Monday to 
discuss the proposal further if he would like.

Best,
Jeff

1.  Just wanted to let you know that not every Californian agrees with our  
Attorney General. 
2. Read with interest a Dow Jones story regarding about a 4 page proposal  
Enron gave to Speaker Hertzberg allowing large commercial customers. 
3.  Would love to see that proposal. 
4.  Thanks.
