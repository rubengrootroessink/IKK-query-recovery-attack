Greetings folks:

I have scheduled 9:30 Friday for a meeting with Danny.  The video conference 
rooms were booked.  How about having the meeting in Danny's office and we 
conference in Drew?  Please advise.

Julie,
We had a great idea (but poor execution) to get together with Danny this 
morning.  Even though I'm going to be out on Friday, if Danny is available, 
could you block off about 30 minutes in the a.m. for Drew, Susan, Jeff 
Dasovich and myself to run an idea past him?  If Danny asks, let him know 
we're trying to weigh the merits of filing to build an expansion into the 
state of California.  Whether we ultimately build it or not isn't the issue 
as much as whether the threat of another pipeline could motivate the 
utilities and the CPUC to build additonal take-away capacity for TW 
shippers.  I think Steve Harris is out of town for the rest of the week.  If 
not, we'll certainly want to plug him in also.  Will you let me know in the 
a.m.?  Thanks.
