him and told him that I'd pass it along.  I don't know who (if anyone) in E=

is interested in OSS---I can't recall if it's a component of our=20
architecture, or not.  If there is someone who might be interested, could y=
ou=20
forward this along?  They can choose to follow up, or not.  Hope all is wel=
l,=20

Best,
