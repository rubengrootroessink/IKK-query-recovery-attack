John:

I could be wrong about what I think Loretta's doing so make sure that 
somebody verifies before you pass on what I've said.  Could be totally wrong; 
but hope I'm right.

Best,
Jeff

Subject: ACR Inviting Comment On DWR/CPUC Proposed Rate Agreement



Attached is an assigned Commissioner ruling (ACR) inviting comment on the
proposed rate agreement between the California Dept. of Water Resources and
the California Public Utilities Commission.  Interested parties may file
comments with the Docket Office on or before August 1, 2001.

Please note that there are three attachments to the ACR. Attachment A, the
proposed rate agreement, is being forwarded to you as a separate PDF
document.  Attachment B, the relevant Water Code sections, is contained in
the body of the attached Word document.  Attachment C is the two page letter
from the DWR, the Dept. of Finance, and the Treasurer's Office to President
Lynch dated July 2, 2001.  Attachment C was previously distributed to the
A.00-11-038 et al service list in the Chief ALJ's ruling dated July 5, 2001.
Today's ACR and all three of the attachments can also be accessed at the
CPUC's web site.
