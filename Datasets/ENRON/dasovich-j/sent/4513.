Marybeth:

I apologize. As I mentioned, this situation is extremely fluid.  I also 
mentioned this morning that in yesterday's meeting w/the Governor, it was 
agreed that the meetings would continue, every day, until the thing got 
resolved.  I was just informed that I've been elected by my management to be 
on today's call (Steve Kean and I will be our representatives).  It starts at 
1PM.  We are scheduled to talk at 2:30 PM.  I'm hoping--but not altogether 
hopeful---that the call will end before 2:30.

I can't apologize enough for the scheduling problems, particularly since I'm 
the one who originated the request to chat with Laura.  

We can do it one of several ways; it's completely your call:  1) play it by 
ear, and I can let you know around 2:15 if I think the call's going to wrap 
up by 2:30.  2) we can reschedule (I would of course very much like to brief 
Laura on what's going on). 3) you can decide it's too much trouble and throw 
up your hands, which I would understand.

Let me know how you 'd like to proceed and please give my sincere apologies 
(and best) to Laura.  I have to get on the call right now, so if you need to 
speak to a live person, give Joseph a call at 415.782.7841.

Best,
Jeff
