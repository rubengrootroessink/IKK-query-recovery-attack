Dr. Littlechild.  

I'm very disappointed that our schedules seemed to pass in the night.  I had 
an engagement on Monday night, which regrettably kept me from having dinner 
with the speakers.  And Tuesday I was traveling.  I tried to call the 
Claremont and had a dreadful time trying to leave you a message.  If you 
haven't left the states yet, I would very much like to get together.  
Otherwise, I'll just have to come to London.  I understand that David Teece 
has filled you in on our discussions.  Would like to discuss that futher with 
you.  It was a great pleasure to meet you, however briefly, and I hope that 
our paths cross again very soon.

All the best,
Jeff

Sorry we missed last night. I was expecting to see you at the dinner. I 
should like to visit the office if there is time. My constraints today are 
lecture at Berkeley 12.30 to 2pm, and they suggest I should be there around 
11.30 beforehand. Also a request to meet someone from STG consulting, with 
whom I am doing some work, probably in Menlo Park, and an invitation to 
dinner in Berkeley area. I had thought we might meet this morning before the 
lecture, but probably too late now. Could do afterwards, en route to Menlo 
Park? I am at Claremont Hotel until around 11.15, tel 510 843 3000 room 325. 
Am in Business Centre on Hotmail at present but computer's a bit slow here.
Regards
Stephen
