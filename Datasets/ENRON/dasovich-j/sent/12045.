Six Months Later, Edison's Utility May Still End Up Bankrupt
By Liz Goldenberg

Rosemead, California, July 18 (Bloomberg) -- Even if California lawmakers=
=20
pass a rescue plan to bail out insolvent Southern California Edison, some=
=20
analysts say bankruptcy may be the only solution.=20

``The reason they haven't filed remains more of a mystery than when they wi=
ll=20
file,'' said Jon Kyle Cartwright, a senior energy credit analyst at Raymond=
=20
James & Associates Inc. in St. Petersburg, Florida, who isn't recommending=
=20
buying any debt sold by California utilities.=20

``If the weather heats up or their creditors wise up, they'll have to go in=
to=20
bankruptcy,'' said Cartwright.=20

Six months after the state's No. 2 utility defaulted on its debt, Californi=
a=20
lawmakers are debating a rescue package designed to restore it to investmen=
t=20
grade status. Any failure to do so by Friday, when the legislature is=20
scheduled to adjourn for a month, may result in a collapse of negotiations=
=20
between the lawmakers, the governor, and the utility, and ultimately,=20
bankruptcy.=20

There are at least three versions under consideration, each targeting=20
different groups, such as large businesses or power suppliers, to help foot=
=20
the bill for the bailout. There isn't any agreement as to what the rescue=
=20
should look like, who will pay, and who is to blame for the situation.=20

Acceptable Option?=20

The bad news for the utility and its creditors is that ``bankruptcy seems t=
o=20
be an increasingly accepted option by the legislature,'' said Dorothea=20
Matthews, the senior utility analyst for CreditSights, Inc., a research fir=
m.=20

Any three unsecured creditors can file a petition to put the utility into=

bankruptcy. Debt holders, banks, and power generators are Southern Californ=
ia=20

The original rescue, signed on Apr. 9, between Governor Gray Davis and Edis=
on=20
expires on Aug. 15. If legislative action isn't taken by then, either party=
=20
can back out.=20

That is something that Southern California Edison may do, ``given the delay=
s=20
that have plagued the rehabilitation process at virtually every stage,'' sa=
id=20
David Bodek, an analyst who covers the utilities industry for Standard &=20
Poor's, a credit rating company.=20

Edison may decide that its utility may fare better under the eye of a=20
bankruptcy judge rather than politicians.=20

The lawmakers' goal is to save the utility in a way that is palatable to th=
em=20
and to California voters. Stock and debt holders aren't a priority, analyst=
s=20
said.=20

Do the Right Thing=20

``Investors will brunt the majority of the pain here,'' said Raymond James'=
s=20
Cartwright. ``An investment thesis that requires a group of politicians to=
=20
get together and do the right thing is ill fated -- there is no way of=20
knowing what the state will or will not do.''=20

On a conference call yesterday with investors holding Southern California=
=20
Edison debt in default, Edison chief financial officer Ted Craver said that=
=20
while all the legislation being debated has returning the utility to=20
creditworthiness as a goal, the language needed to achieve that wasn't=20
included.=20

``This is the beginning of the legislative process'' that will go on for th=
e=20
next few days, he said.=20

Creditworthiness, which Edison officials say is the most important goal, is=
=20
determined by credit rating companies and investors, rather than by the=20
legislature or the utility.=20

Stay Tuned=20

``Our money is still on an eventual filing'' for bankruptcy, said=20
CreditSights' Matthews, who puts those chances at about 80 percent. ``Stay=
=20

warming up in the wings.''=20

Southern California Edison accrued more than $5.4 billion in debts as it pa=
