The original proposed messages I distributed for the high tech sector have 
been put into a power point presentation and include comments received. Many 
thanks to Margaret Carson, who did much of the heavy lifting.   Additional 
comments are welcome and suggestions on how to spice up the korny title slide 
are greatly appreciated.

Best,
Jeff
