Good idea.  Unfortunately, I'll be sitting in an office in S.D. with Sempra 
execs.  My apologies.  But since this is likely to be ongoing, preference 
would be to participate in the "first" meeting.

Jeff,

Could you possibly call in? We could arrange for a dial-in number in that 
case.  I know that we arranged that date with tax bc/Sue is coming in that 
day and they had cleared that date with some of the accounting or legal folks 
already.  Please let me know.  Thanks.

Lara

Lara:
I would very much like to attend but have a meeting scheduled that day with 
Chris Calger (ENA) and the CEO and CFO of Sempra Energy (we're trying to do a 
deal with them).   That's a date that I can't change.  I can meet on Nov. 
3rd, or Nov. 7-9.  Hope it's possible to re-arrange

Best,
Jeff

Jeff and Mike,

Our first meeting has been scheduled to take place on November 2nd.  The 
meeting will probably last half a day and will begin around 1pm.  Please let 
me if you plan to attend.  Thanks and have a great weekend.

Regards,
Lara
