Steve:  I'm going to give you a call.  Few things:
Got your message.  As you'll see from the document, I likely spent too much 
time over the weekend on the "what's in it for consumers" messages.  Since it 
was one of the the "to do" items, I figured that it should get some emphasis, 
but sounds like that may not be the case.
I've proposed a template for how to provide feedback on the Gov's specific 
proposals, using direct investment in power plants by the state as the 
illustrative example.  Let me know if you think it works.  I have ideas on 
each, but thought it better to await feedback from the commercial folks 
before filling out our comments in each area.
I'm finishing up a bit more detailed proposal for how the Gov might use 
"energy gurus" to help on the portfolio/procurment issues, and am also 
offering additional detail on the need for a "rate summit."
Got messages in to Schroeder re: Nordpool--expect to hear back from him today 
at some point and I can drop that info into the document soon as I get it.
Will talk to EES at 10 AM CST to discuss their proposals.  If you'd like to 
join that call, let me know and I'll forward along the call-in number, which 
I think you may already have in your email.
Have received a few comments from ENA that I'll incorporate.

Best,
Jeff
