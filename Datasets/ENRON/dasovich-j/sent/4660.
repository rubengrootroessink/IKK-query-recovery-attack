The dinner was incredibly delicious.  Thank you very much.  I apologize for 
being so late--increasingly I have less and less control over my schedule.  
Would have much preferred to have spent it with you guys.  And sorry that I 
pooped out so early---I'm running on zero sleep and had a 7:30 conference 
call this morning.

That said, the dinner was really extraordinary.  You guys outdid yourself.  
Made an others tough day very nice.  Thanks.

Best,
Jeff
