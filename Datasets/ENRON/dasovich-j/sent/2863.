Mike:  This should offer a guide to developing legislation that narrows PUC 
review of utility purchases to approval of the competitive solicitation used 
by the utility to procure the contracts.  We have consistently argued against 
being prescriptive (i.e., the contracts should be of 3 years long, less than 
$60/MWH, etc.)
