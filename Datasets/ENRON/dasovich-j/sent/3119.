Hi folks:

Since we have only one page, the write up for number 4 will have to be very=
=20
brief.  Before writing it, though, I wanted to offer a few bullets regardin=
g=20
what angle we might take, and let folks respond, comment, counter, etc.=20
before writing it up.  I'll clean and beef up once we've agreed to the=20
approach we'd like to take to question #4.  Finally, I can work from my=20
office on this this evening, which means that I can use the conference call=
=20
capability of my office phone to patch everyone in if we'd like to do a=20
conference call. If that's what folks would like to do, I'd prefer to do th=
e=20
call at around 7 PM.  Just let me know. =20

Best,
Jeff

The question for #4 is:

Stock price is down 23%, significant debt has already been tapped to suppor=
t=20
massive growth and covenants on that debt restrict taking on a lot more=20
debt. =20

What should HD do w.r.t. current operations and future growth strategy?
 In the near term focus less on growth and more on getting margins and EBIT=
=20
growth back in line with results from previous years.  (Management=01,s Let=
ter=20
to Shareholders alludes to this, but it=01,s difficult to determine whether=
=20
management is just paying lip service to the need to capitalize on the grow=
th=20
spurt and grown earnings, or continue on the growth effort.)

 With respect to funding future (more moderate growth), the company does ha=
ve=20
some room to increase long-term debt (e.g., current ratio for 1986 =3D 2.26=
). =20
It seems that HD would get better terms and have increased flexibility by=
=20
issuing additional debt rather than relying on lines of credit.  As such, H=
D=20
ought to look those sources of funding and fill in any =01&funding gaps=018=
 with=20
funds from the line of credit.

 Given the significant drop in stock price, HD is likely better off in the=
=20
near term 1) moderating growth, 2) improving performance to generate cash=
=20
internally, and 3) using long-term debt issuance to provide the funds=20
needed.  Once performance and stock price improves, then HD should consider=
 a=20
stock issuance.

How can company improve operating performance?
Reduce selling, store operating expenses and pre-opening expenses
Improve receivables turnover
Improve inventory turnover
Improve per store/sales
Consider closing poor-performing stores
All of which will improve margins
=20
Should company change its strategy?  If so how?
Shift from meteoric growth to moderate, targeted growth, and focus on=20
generating positive cash flow from operations
Focus on improving performance at existing stores; specifically focus on=20
controlling costs and asset turnover and productivity
Consider another debt issuance rather than rely extensively on credit line =
in=20
order to decrease cost of funds and increase flexibility
