I just figured it was a way for you to finally track him down---you know, 
show up at his class and get midevil on his ass for a few minutes....

That is a great solution!  You mean work part time, or go to school part 
time.  Very selfishly, I'm of course very glad that you're staying in the 
evening program.  We're actually getting together on Sunday (I hope I didn't 
mess things up).  Yes, it's for finance, though you're welcome to join---we 
can use all the help that we can get.

I'm really glad to hear that things are going better.  You seemed in pretty 
good spirits on Tuesday, though I guess that could have partially been due to 
the big celebration over getting your first ticket.  Congratulations!  I'll 
buy you a beer.  I have a feeling that the only reason you haven't gotten one 
until now is because you've managed to talk your way out of many.

Best,
Jeff

It was a little dramatic when I saw that Tuesday
night.  I feel a bit overwhelmed that he's back.  The
quality, the learnings!  What to do?  If only I can
find a way to get in the class.  Jeez!  Seriously
though-you like the offering? Thanks for checking in
on Tuesday.  Things are better...less overwhelmed by
decisions and such.  Staying part-time (decision as of
Monday).  Expect to spend more time in SF with the job
after next week.  Want to keep my options open and
feel I can do that better hanging out in the evening
program.  Jackie mentioned that you are all grouping
on Sat to study..is this for finance?  Talk to you
soon-
Courtney
