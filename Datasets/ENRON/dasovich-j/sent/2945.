Dean Tyson:
Attached is the proposal.  Your comments are welcome and appreciated.  I'd be 
happy to input any that you might have prior to forwading to Secretary 
Summers.  Phil and I will have a list of potential contacts from the business 
community to review in the next couple of hours.  If you need anything, don't 
hesitate to contact me.  Perhaps you and Phil and I could touch base later 
today or this evening to talk about next steps.  Thanks again for your 
efforts.

Best,
Jeff
