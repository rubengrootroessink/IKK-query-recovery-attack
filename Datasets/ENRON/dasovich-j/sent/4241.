Carolyn:

I wanted to apologize for the way the group dynamic has shaped up.  It's 
clear to me that you're a bit frustrated, and if I've contributed, I 
apologize.  

You've done the most work on this project, your contribution has been very 
significant, and I personally am not satisfied about the way that the stuff 
you've pulled together (and your views) have been included.  At some point, 
though, it gets tough beating one's head against the wall.  Seems to me that, 
in a group, everyone should have some of their views included---that's what 
groups and compromises are all about.  After all, it's school.  We've made a 
lot of sacrifices to do it, and the point is to learn.

Anyway, I hope you'll still comment on the presentation, and I'm glad that 
you've agreed to do part of it on Thursday.  For my part, I felt that I 
pushed yesterday about as much as I'm prepared to push and at this point, 
I'll put the ratios tables together, offer a few edits, buy don' t see much 
use going to the mat.

Overall, I think it'll be an okay presentation, though getting there has 
been, well, bumpy.

But thanks very much for all the work you did.  It was important, and the 
presentation is better off for it.

Best,
Jeff
