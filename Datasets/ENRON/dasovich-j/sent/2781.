Scott sent this to Marty, but I assume you already have had communications 
with him about this.

Marty.  This is a summary of our message from this morning for you to send on 
or discuss with Keene.  I hope this is helpful.  Scott

What's important
Give solvency to the utilities by guaranteeing no banckruptcy against the 
generation assets of the utilities.  Guarantees to be recovered, if needed, 
through surcharges over 10 years.  This should give the process time for 
thoughtful solutions.  Ending the rate freeze now will give the utilities an 
undeserved windfall (3.5b alone related to nuclear assets in year 2001).
There should be thoughtful process to determine: i) how to keep deregulation 
going, ii) how existing generation assets should be used, iii) what are the 
value of existing assets, iv) when is the appropriate time for customers to 
be exposed to the market, and v) what kind of market structure would be 
appropriate going forward. 
Customers should not be dumped into the market, now or in the next year, 
while it is extremely illiquid due to many errors of the utilities.
There should not be retroactive rate making (the negative ctc should be paid 
until at least the rate freeze is ended)
All customers should be treated equally with respect to existing generation 
assets that they paid for for the past 4-30 years.
There should be a special hearing called to debate demand side prospects (ie. 
curtailment etc.)

The Governor cancelled the meeting at the last minute.  Apparently, he was 
trying to schedule a meeting with Clinton and our meeting conflicted, so we 
were bumped.  We are trying to set a new time.  I will share with the 
Governor's energy advisor the information and recommendations all of you 
helped put together.  Thanks
