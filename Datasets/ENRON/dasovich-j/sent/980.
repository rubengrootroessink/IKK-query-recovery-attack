If Karen thinks it would be useful to have the PR firm go and report back, 
that's how we'll handle it.  Otherwise, we'll get reports from others.  Other 
commitments win out over FERC's "open mike."

We discussed this with Rick and Jeff when I was in Houston last week.  FERC 
made it clear at the hearing on the 9th that the SD hearing was for people 
who could not make it to Wash DC.  So, we thought it unnecessary for Enron to 
seek to speak.  We thought, instead, that an observer might be appropriate.  
Jeff mentioned the new firm we hired as a possibility.  I have child care 
duties in the morning and a WPF Board meeting from 9 - 3.

Mona and I plan to be in Sacramento tomorrow at an AB 1890 Implementation 
Group meeting.  I think that Sue also has a conflict.  My thought was to have 
someone from the PR firm that Karen has brought on go and report back.  I'm 
supposed to give a presentation on gas tomorrow, but it's not a problem for 
me to cancel and go to S.D. if we think that it's vital for one of us to be 
there in person.   Thoughts?

Best,
Jeff
