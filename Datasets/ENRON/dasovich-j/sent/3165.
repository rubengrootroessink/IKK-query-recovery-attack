Just wanted to let you know that I'll be out of the office beginning at 1PM 
but will be checking voicemail and will be available by cell phone and pager.

Best,
Jeff

PS  I'm listening to the leg hearings by phone.  Legislators are making 
Bryson and Mission head Al Fohr (Steve, he was the guy at the meeting we had 
with the Governor's staff) explain in excruciating detail all of the 
transactions that have taken place since AB 1890 passed (e.g., midwest power 
plants buys, New Zealand disco buy).  Also interrogating Harold Ray explain 
Edison's purchasing practices over the past couple of years (i.e., staying 
short in the market).  Edison's not coming off looking great.  Bryson's 
trying to do some major triage---and blaming Loretta for keeping Edison short.
