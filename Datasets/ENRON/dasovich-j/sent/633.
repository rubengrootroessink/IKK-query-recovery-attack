As usual, help was only a phone call [to Jeff Dasovich] away.  You 'da man.  
I went to the site and found (via reference links) the stats I needed.  
Thanks.

hmm.  that makes it tougher.  it's crisis central today.  for quick answers 
try the ISO website (caiso.com).  i think you can find all that you need. if 
not get back to me.
