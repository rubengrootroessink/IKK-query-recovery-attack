Calif ISO Cuts Power Refund Estimate To $6.1B From $8.9B    =20

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--California's estimate of how much the state was=20
overcharged by power suppliers dropped to $6.1 billion from $8.9 billion wh=
en=20
an adjustment requested by a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission judge was=
=20
taken into account, according to data submitted to FERC last week.=20

The California Independent System Operator's estimate fell when the grid=20
operator excluded power bought by utilities not under its purview, and its=
=20
estimate could fall again as it works in other recommendations made by the=
=20
judge following the conclusion of 15 days of talks between power suppliers=
=20
and the state over potential refunds last week.=20

Even as the ISO continues to recalculate its refund estimate, however, the=
=20
state is sticking to the original $8.9 billion figure, which has been calle=
d=20
arbitrary by critics. The $6.1 billion estimate merely establishes "a=20
potential framework for settlement discussions," Eric Hildebrandt, the ISO'=
s=20
chief analyst on the matter, told the FERC.=20

FERC administrative law judge Curtis Wagner, who has dismissed the $8.9=20
billion figure as baseless and criticized California's delegation for not=
=20
negotiating in good faith, estimated in his report on the talks that refund=
s=20
due may amount to about $1 billion. Power suppliers offered just over $700=
=20
million.=20

Wagner has recommended FERC hold a 60-day hearing to set the level of refun=
ds=20
and has told the ISO to revise its estimate of what California is owed.=20

The ISO's original $8.9 billion figure included electricity sales to=20
municipal utilities and alternative energy suppliers that didn't go through=
=20
the ISO's wholesale markets, the California Power Exchange or the Californi=
a=20
Department of Water Resources. Without direct knowledge of the prices of=20
those purchases, the ISO made estimates.=20

"We know the volume (of the bilateral deals)," Hildebrandt said. "The refun=
d=20
amount was based on extrapolation of observed prices in the spot market."=
=20


Resetting The Baseline=20


Wagner told the ISO to recalculate its figure using only sales through the=
=20
ISO and CalPX markets - which were set up by the state's deregulation law f=
or=20
California's three investor-owned utilities to purchase power - in addition=
=20
to sales to the California Department of Water Resources.=20

The DWR has been buying power for the utilities since PG&E Corp. (PCG, news=
,=20
msgs) unit Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Edison International (EIX, news,=
=20
msgs) unit Southern California Edison ran out of cash in January. DWR has=
=20
also been covering the needs of Sempra Energy (SRE, news, msgs) unit San=20
Diego Gas & Electric Co.=20

In arriving at his new estimate, the ISO's Hildebrandt also recalculated fa=
ir=20
prices - the baseline against which refundable amounts are determined - by=
=20
retroactively applying the price controls FERC imposed June 19. Those=20
controls set prices by the operating costs of the least efficient generator=
=20
needed to meet demand each hour.=20

But last week, after Hildebrandt completed his $6.1 billion estimate, Wagne=
r=20
recommended to FERC commissioners that the June 19 price control formula be=
=20
modified when used retroactively to determine refunds.=20

Those modifications, if applied to the ISO's estimate, would cut refunds mu=
ch=20
further. For example, FERC's price limits are now based on a monthly averag=
e=20
of natural gas prices covering supplies throughout the state. Wagner=20
recommended using power producers' actual gas costs. Since gas is=20
considerably more expensive in southern California, using actual prices wou=
ld=20
cut potential refunds sharply.=20

Also, Wagner said that refunds should be ordered on sales only as far back =
as=20
Oct. 2, which would reduce the total amount claimed by California by about=
=20
one-third, according to Hildebrandt's previous monthly breakdown.=20

ISO staff is again recalculating the refund estimate to reflect some of=20
Wagner's recommendations, but the ISO will still include sales back to May=
=20
2000, said spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle.=20

"The reason we're not going back just to Oct. 2 is that all of the=20
overcharges going back to May should be repaid," McCorkle said. "We just=20
maintain that position."=20


FERC Baseline Questioned=20


In addition, Hildebrandt argues in his recently released estimate that when=
=20
fair prices are calculated retroactively using FERC's new formula, the pric=
e=20
cap should be based on the least efficient generator the ISO knows to have=
=20
been available, not the least efficient generator actually used to meet=20
demand.=20

That's because the FERC's new price controls require all available generato=
rs=20
be made available to the ISO at any time, Hildebrandt said.=20

Applying that rule would raise the ISO's revised estimate substantially: to=
=20
$7.7 billion from $6.1 billion.=20

One of the ways generators managed to manipulate prices higher, Hildebrandt=
=20
said, was to not offer cheaper power from more efficient units. Considering=
=20
only the least efficient generator actually used would make permanent the=
=20
rewards for such withholding, he said.=20

"The judge is in error to suggest that the actual (least-efficient) unit us=
ed=20
would have been called on if the must-offer requirement were in effect,"=20
Hildebrandt said in an interview.=20

In arriving at his estimate, Hildebrandt determined the difference between=
=20
actual sales prices and what prices would have been for every seller and fo=
r=20
every hour since May 1, 2000, had price controls been in effect. The ISO=20
released only the total potential refund, not the company-specific shares.=
=20

Hildebrandt took issue with generating companies that have complained his=
=20
numbers aren't justified.=20

"These are based on very tangible records," he said. "The idea that it's a=
=20
black box is misleading."=20
