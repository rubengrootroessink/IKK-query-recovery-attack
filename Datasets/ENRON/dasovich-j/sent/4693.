No problem.  Let's talk.  I'm really comfortably having you and me and your 
mom and keith talk about.  I'm very interested in buying Jay's property, but 
I don't even the details yet.  Here's my suggestion.  If they want to come up 
that bad, they should.  My agent is a very cool person up there.  Here name 
is Sharon Burningham.  She is with Coldwell Banker.  Her number is 
707.884.5270.  ext. 308.  You should feel free to tell your mom that Prentice 
and I have always have the intention of buying Jay's place, and we've had a 
sort of unspoken agreement that he'd give us the first "head's up" when he 
decided to sell.  To be honest, we didn't expect it to be this quick, but 
hey, it is what it is.  You can also tell your mom that I'm very happy to 
talk about partnering with her.  But it's WAY to early right now.  As we 
discussed, I need to spend some time with Jay---the other very important 
thing for me is that Jay's a very good friend, and I want to protect that, 
too.  In the meantime, I think that it would be great for your mom and Keith 
to have Sharon take them around and show them some killer 
million--plus--dollar homes and have some fun cruising around and seeing what 
the area has to offer.  I'm real happy to call Sharon, too.  That sound like 
a plan?  Where can I call you?

Best,
Jeff

Dude,

I just talked to my mom, and they are chomping at the bit, if that's the 
right expression. My mom even wants to come up Wed and stay til Thurs night! 
I told her to chill a bit, that she might not be able to see Jay's property. 
She still wants to come up, so I told her we might be able to look at some 
other stuff, so do you think I should talk to an agent about this? They are 
damn excited, and I don't really know how to calm them down. They went to 
bookstores and looked at pictures of the area. They are probably talking 
about it all the time. I tell you this so you know what I'm dealing with 
over here. She also asked me if you were thinking of buying it, and I told 
her I wasn't sure. Do you want me to tell her that you're thinking about it? 
I know they'd totally respect your position, if we told them that. I'm not 
sure I even want them to come up this week, but they are so emphatic that 
it'd be nothing less than an insult to tell them not to. Anyway, give me 
some advise on this matter, please.

Cheers!

Scott

Also, thanks for giving Cameron your car; I know she's psyched.
