It's nothing.  I eat your food, drink your wine, eat your tomatoes, stay in 
your time share, date your daughter, use your pool table, stay at your dome, 
and get feted by you on my birthdays.  Paying for Ms Beautiful's golf is a 
small token, indeed.

Best,
Jeff

p.s. hope everything at work is going well--i'm sure that it is.

p.p.s.  we say barry's 500th last nite!!!!  It was so cool.  go giants.

You are so sweet - I did not expect you to pay for Prentice's golf in Mexico
- I added that to her loan balance.  That was very generous of you.  I got
both checks last night so thank you.
