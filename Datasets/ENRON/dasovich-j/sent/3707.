FYI.  Bill Gang of EES Federal Solutions has been working actively with the 
Air Force in California.  I've participated in weekly calls with them in the 
effort to get them energized about DA.  Turns out they're precluded by law 
from lobbying.  But they seem to have other ways of being influential.  I've 
put Scott Govenar in contact with them and he's keeping them in the DA 
Coalition loop.  Bill/Scott is this guy familiar to you?  Bill any 
suggestions on how we might best target them in our efforts to get groups 
energized?  Bill:  Perhaps you could phone Janel Guerrero directly to 
discuss?  Her number is:  713.853.9104 (is that right Janel)?

Best,
Jeff

I think a Ken letter is a great idea.  I'll ask him about participating in 
the Coalition.

This is great Sue.  I would like to loop him into our non-business target 
with a letter from Ken.  Do you also see them having a role in the Direct 
Access Coaltion?  I'll let you work that end.

Governor -- I'll forward that email next.

Thanks - that is what I had assumed.

One of your e-mails was forwarded to me by my people at Edwards AFB.  As the
lead utility counsel for one of the larger purchasers of electricity in the
state, I am obviously very interested in this subject.  Keeping the direct
access option is important to us, not just to keep the state honest on price
shifting between customer classes, but also for reasons of reliability and
power composition.  As a Federal agency, we have a goal to meet on renewable
power, and this will be difficult if not impossible to do if we do not have
some degree of choice in the composition of our electricity.

I'm not sure how you got my name, but I believe that the proposed language
has not yet been officially introduced.  It's being circulated for comments
now.

I apologize for being dense, but when I checked the version of SBX 27 on
the
legislative web site, it is nothing like what is discussed in your e-mail.
Is there an amendment (or several of them) that I have missed and that are
not showing on the site (which shows no movement since the bill was
introduced)?  I have attached an RTF file of the version of the bill I
found
on the website at:


http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/bill/sen/sb_0001-0050/sbx1_27_bill_20010131_intro

duced.html

Please give me a call if you have a minute to discuss this situation.

Things are looking up!  If this passes, we should be in pretty good shape.
Note the part that says we can operate as we wish up to June 1!

Subject:  SBX 27 -- Direct Access Language Proposed by Bowen

This is an OK bill.  Not well drafted. It's also overly complicated and
proscriptive.

Deletes the offensive part of ABX 1.
It allows anybody to do whatever they want until June 1 (section 2 d)
On June 1,
  - res and small commercial customers can get in a cue and get DA up to
the # of MWs that are added through load growth. (Section 2 e)
  -- Larger customers would pay an exit fee. (section 2 f)
  -- DA customers would be a entrance fee to return to IOU service (Section
2 g)

There is also a confusing section (2 c) that says a retail customer is only
stuck with CDWR for the proportion of power that CDWR provides.  The way it
reads, if CDWR is providing 40% of the IOUs' power, the retail customer can
get DA for 60% of its load.  I doubt that will fly -- too difficult to keep
track of and ISO will oppose (only one scheduling coordinator/meter)

A conference call and meeting is scheduled with parties tomorrow on this
language.

Will keep you apprised.

Attached, please find the proposed amendments to SBX 27 (Bowen) relating
to direct access.  There will be a direct access coalition conference
call tomorrow to discuss current events as well as the new language.
