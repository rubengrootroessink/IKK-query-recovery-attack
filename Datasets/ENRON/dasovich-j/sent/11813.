Jeff:

One of my senior colleagues is visiting San Francisco on July 2nd and 3rd,
with two senior members of the government of New South Wales (Australia) in
tow. Frontier are advising the NSW government on their electric
restructuring process. My coleague Danny Price is a real star on power
markets - he has worked on it for longer than I have even.

Inevitably, these people are interested in understanding the California
meltdown. We have scheduled for them to meet a range of folks in California,
including two of the CPUC Comissioners, Lorreta Lynch's chief of staff, Cal
ISO, PG&E, one of the generators, etc. They are forewarned that the CPUC and
Davis's office will be all political bluster.

Any chance they might catch up with someone from Enron for an hour? Could
buy you a nice lunch on Monday July 2nd? Enron has a substntial operation in
Australia but I guess that is a bit out of your balliwick.

I realize this is a very late (and unusual request) so I completely
understand if it is inconvenient or impossible.


Cheers


Seabron
