I'm assuming that since it's the middle of March, that it's only fair that he 
should get paid for services rendered in January, but maybe I'm missing 
something.

Paul, Sue and Joseph - 

I wanted to give you all a quick update on the Mike Day invoices.  I have the 
invoice for January and understand from Joseph that he has the invoice for 
the special session which once reviewed, coded and approved Joseph will 
overnight to Houston.  I called Larry Dallman in accounting and Larry 
confirmed that Goodin, MacBride is currently on a Net 7 payment term.  Larry 
said that he could expedite payment for the January and special session 
invoices for same day pay.  Accounting will call me when the checks are ready 
to be picked up and I will fed ex payment to Mr. Day's attention once I have 
the checks.  Larry and I agreed that it would be best to wait to send the 
invoices at one time (this will make it easier for accounting).

Paul - As you and I discussed, I will send an email to Mr. Day once I have 
received the invoices to advise him when to expect payment and I will confirm 
that he should be the recipient once I have the checks.  I'll make sure to 
copy you, Sue and Joseph so we all stay on the same page.

Please advise of any questions, comments or concerns.
