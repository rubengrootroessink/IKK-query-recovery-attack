Bids Made For Broke NorthPoint

EMERYVILLE, CALIFORNIA, U.S.A., 2001 MAR 6 (NB). Bidding started today on 
bankrupt broadband services provider Northpoint Communications Group 
[NASDAQ:NPNTQ], more than three months after Verizon Communications [NYSE:VZ] 
killed the companies' merger plan.
Northpoint did not identify bidders or discuss the amount of bids received, 
citing a "quiet period" that precludes disclosure of such details. 
"It is our hope to sell the company as a whole, but we cannot speculate on 
the outcome of this structured sale process," Northpoint Communications 
President and CEO Liz Fetter said in a news release.
Bidding is scheduled to close on March 20 and the winning bid will be 
submitted to bankruptcy court the next day, Northpoint said.
Emeryville, Calif.-based Northpoint filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy 
protection on Jan. 16, six weeks after Verizon scuttled the companies' plans 
to merge. Northpoint has since sued Verizon for $1 billion in damages over 
cancellation of the merger.
Verizon on Nov. 29 pulled out of the $800 million merger agreement, citing 
Northpoint's deteriorating financial condition. The companies intended to 
merge their digital subscriber line (DSL) businesses into a national 
broadband company.
Northpoint spokesman Marvin Wamble told Newsbytes that the company currently 
employs 1,065 people, down from its peak level of 1,800 workers last year.
