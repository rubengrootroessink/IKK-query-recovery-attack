Got your message re: reverse auction all of the utility's demand.  Getting 
(interestingly complicated), though.  Now, the utilities want to create a 
"core/noncore" split in electricity, like in gas  (where large gas customers 
can't take commodity from the utility).  With a core/noncore split, Edison 
claims that QF contracts, nukes and other existing generation that it still 
holds is sufficient to meet "core" needs and it therefore may not need 
"contracts."  As you can imagine, large customers ain't clamoring to get 
thrown into the market as "noncore" customers right about now.  But they may 
find themselves without a choice.  I talked to Calger on Friday about reverse 
auction versus benchmark and I'll be talking to the traders about it this 
afternoon, and we'll be discussing further when Rick, Steffes et al are here 
tomorrow.  Will let you know where it goes.

Best,
Jeff
