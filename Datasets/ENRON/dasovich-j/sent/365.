Hey Buddy:

Hope your weekend was nice.  Tried to call, but I think your voicemail is 
messed up out there today.  Checking in to see whether Hoecker said it or 
not.  Any word?  Also, looks like we're on for Portland next 
Tuesday/Wednesday.  Would definitely like to gather (phone call or something) 
prior to the meeting so we (me, you, Rick, Richard) are clear on what our 
goals are for the meeting and what the agenda needs to look like.  Finally, I 
should have a draft of my "Tech Section" ready by tomorrow sometime.  That 
was our deadline, correct?  Any other follow-info from last 
Tuesday'Wednesday's meeting that I should be aware of?  Finally, you see 
Harry's note?  Can you make a call to discuss the PG&E strategy on Wednesday?

Best,
Jeff
