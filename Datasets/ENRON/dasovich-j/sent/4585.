Thanks.  Will be very interested to hear how the meeting goes.  My sense is 
that the timing could be just about right. 
Best,
Jeff

		 Subject: Leadership meeting

The four leaders of both houses are meeting in the speaker's office this
afternoon to discuss ways to solve the energy crisis.  I left a meeting
with the Speaker to vacate the room for the leadership meeting, which
was described to me by the Speaker's Chief of Staff as preliminary to a
global solution, if one is achievable.  I have a scheduled meeting with
one of the leaders later today at which time I hope to get feedback on
any progress.

Hedy
