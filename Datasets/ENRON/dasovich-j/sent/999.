FYI.  Attached is a presentation on gas markets that I gave to an electricity 
group yesterday.  The group was formed out of California's restructuring 
legislation (AB 1980).  It's called the "AB 1980 Implementation Group" (I 
heard that the group decided that its time to change its name.).  The group 
includes just about all of the interest groups in California.  

I focused on the fact that gas offers a model of a "real" market that 
California should look to in order to fix the "artificial" and failed 
electricity model created by AB 1980.

Best,
Jeff
