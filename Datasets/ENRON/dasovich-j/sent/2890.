Don't mean to keep the chain of emails going, but given the cameras and the 
grand-standing politicians (who seem to have an abundance of rhetoric and 
capacity for scape-goating, and a paucity of constructive solutions or the 
will necessary to do what needs to be done), seems worth considering the pros 
and cons of throwing anyone in front of any legislative committees.  We may 
decide that the pros outweigh the cons and that there's discernable value 
having our outside counsel speak to the issues of supply and demand in 
California and the West, but seems worth spending 5 or 10 minutes on.

Best,
Jeff

What the heck are you doing awake at 2:00 a.m.  

Re:  the hearing.  I'm really not sure that this hearing is worth spending 
alot of time worrying about--at least given my understanding of the scope of 
this Committee's responsibilities during the special session (i.e, the lack 
of responsibilities).   Although, Sandi may know more about the importance of 
this hearing based on discussions with the Committee folks, from our 
discssions over the past couple of days in Sacto it really seems like the 
hearing will be informational in nature.

In any event,  I don't see the downside to having Mike do the testimony.   
Mike knows enough to be helpful to the Committee.  He's easy to insert in the 
process.   While I have absolutely no problems using Robert Michaels, the 
hearing is on Tuesday--less than one week from today--and somebody would have 
to vet his testimony and work with him to prepare the document.  If we can 
make this work, I'm all for it.  It just seem a lot easier to use Mike.   

Re:  why can't we just say no.  From my standpoint there is an upside in 
participating--we continue to support Wright.  Wright has become the voice of 
reason on energy issues.

Can't we just say "no"?  I know Rod thinks highly of Mike, but I'm having a 
hard time seeing what he can add on the stated topic.  Mike Day is certainly 
no expert on supply and demand.  I can understand our reluctance in putting 
an Enron person on the stand, so maybe we shouldn't.  Why not pay an 
economics consultant, like Robert Michaels to represent us?  He's been in the 
media lately and has the right type of expertise.  ALso, he's just joined 
TCA, so we could easily use him.

The invitation is to participate in a meeting before the Utilities and 
Commerce Committee of the regular session.  The oversight committee is an 
entirely different matter--as of yesterday no schedule for its meetings had 
been set (timing may follow the release of the CPUC auditor's report on the 
utilities). 

As for the invitation to speak, my thought is that we ask Mike Day to speak 
on our behalf.  The issue we have been asked to address is, very generally, 
supply and demand.    Day has a lot of credibility with Wright and it's 
Wright's committee.   Just be sure, this afternoon, Sandi was following up 
with the Wright's office to get a better picture on scope of the hearing.  
With regard to this subject, I asked Alan Comnes to look through the Mary 
Hain presentation to FERC (from last summer) and pull out the slides that 
were relatively current (or not too awfully out of date).  From what we have 
seen so far, I don't think we need to get to worked up over this particularl 
hearing before the regular Utilities committee.  All the action will occur 
before the special session committees.  

If the need to discuss the hearing continues to be an issue, let's talk 
further.   Sandi please follow up with Sue on what we've discovered through 
Wright's office re:  the Tuesday hearing.

There will be an oversight subcommittee of the new committee formed to
shape energy policy in the Special Session.  In a meeting today,
Assembly Member Darryl Steinberg, who will Chair the subcommittee, told
us he expects to hold two hearings to "track the money" between
utilities, geneators and wholesalers.  He hopes to wait until after the
completion of the PUC audit, unless that audit drags on longer than the
next week or so.  He is planning a "constructive investigation" and
pledges to be fair.  The subcommttee will be staffed by the Speakers
Office of Oversight.

Also, Enron has been invited to testify at an informational hearing of
the Assembly Utilities and Commerce Committee on January 16, 2001.  The
general topiic is how supply and demand affect the California market and
what options are available for new or repowered generation in
California.
