Great.  Glad to hear it.  Did you get my voice mail?  Makes sense for you to 
go ahead and start cobbling together a formal proposal.  I've talked to folks 
internally (and will discuss further with them tomorrow and Friday when I'm 
in Houston).  I'd like you to keep the information confidential, but I'm 
fairly confident that we're already at the point where it's not a matter of 
whether but of what the terms and conditions of the contract and the scope of 
the project will be.

Best,
Jeff

All's well.  Great enthusiasm from everyone I have contacted so far. We can
undoubtedly pull this off.  Look forward to hearing from you.

Hi David:

Thanks again for meeting last week.  Just wanted to let you know that I'll
be meeting in Houston on Thursday to discuss the project we discussed.
Hope all is going well thus far on your end.

Best,
Jeff
