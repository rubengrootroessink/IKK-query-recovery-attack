Hi there - long time no see!!  I honestly do need to know if you and PP want 
to join us for the October 7 dinner cause I honestly am ordering the foie 
gras and will need to get two if you will be with us (cuz you eat so much!)  
I know that Scotty and Cameron will be in Europe

Greetings (or Hola!): 
Talked to Jeff Green.  He said he'd do the road, but can't do it with the 
wood that's in the driveway.  Eldon, are you and Bob planning to go up this 
week?  If so, any chance of getting the wood moved?  Otherwise, going to be 
tough to do the road.  Jeff starts on my road on Wednesday and I'll be 
going up this weekend to monitor (and start organizing some of the chopped 
up wood that's lying around the yard at the dome. 
Welcome back.  Hope you had a good time in Mexico. 
Best, 
Jeff
