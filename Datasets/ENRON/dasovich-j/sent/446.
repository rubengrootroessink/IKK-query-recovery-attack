Speaking of cheese, I spoke with Jeff Green last night, and under the 
circumstances, he'd prefer to do the Dome road next summer (when he's up 
doing more work on my property.  I agreed (there's a lot more bark from all 
the wood chopping and that'll get us through till June).  I talked to him 
about the culvert.  He had some thoughts, which I'll pass along and I'll talk 
to him about it some more this weekend.
