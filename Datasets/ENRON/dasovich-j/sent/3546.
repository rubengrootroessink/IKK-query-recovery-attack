GOP MOVES NATURAL GAS TO FRONT BURNER
Assembly Republicans join together once again to request Davis to call=20
special session.

(SACRAMENTO) =01) Assembly Republicans united Monday in asking Governor Gra=
y=20
Davis to call a special session of the California legislature to deal with=
=20
skyrocketing natural gas prices.

=01&Families and businesses are reeling every month from extraordinary gas=
=20
prices.  Pardon the expression, but the natural gas crisis no longer belong=
s=20
on California=01,s back burner,=018 said Assembly Republican leader Bill Ca=
mpbell=20
(R =01) Villa Park).

Assembly Republicans unanimously signed a letter to Governor Gray Davis=20
asking for him to convene a special session of the legislature to deal with=
=20
California=01,s skyrocketing natural gas bills.  Republicans delivered the=
=20
letter to Davis this morning.

=01&A special session is both a symbolic and a practical necessity.  It tel=
ls=20
Californians that we care about their skyrocketing gas bills.  It tells=20
businesses everywhere that California is going to provide for its future=20
energy needs,=018 said Campbell.  =01&Practically speaking, a special sessi=
on also=20
allow us to pass legislation which can take effect immediately.=018

Republicans believe the electricity and natural gas crises are inextricably=
=20
linked.

=01&California=01,s natural gas crisis is completely intertwined with its=
=20
electricity crisis,=018 said Campbell.  =01&Any plan to deal with our elect=
ricity=20
crisis must have a natural gas component or Californians are going to pay=
=20
unacceptably high prices for both.=018

Assembly Republicans believe the natural gas crisis has many fronts, all of=
=20
which could be addressed comprehensively by a special session.

=01&Natural gas issues include pipeline capacity, storage, exploration,=20
alternative fuels and conservation,=018 said Campbell.  =01&A special sessi=
on lets=20
us put together a comprehensive solution.=018

=01&The private sector has the expertise and the capital to deal with these=
=20
issues if government would just get out of the way.  Republicans believe th=
at=20
a legislative solution to the natural gas crisis should leave the resources=
=20
and primary decision-making to the private sector,=018 said Campbell.
