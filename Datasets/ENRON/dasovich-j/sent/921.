Hi.  Nice to see you in Houston.  I'm giving a presentation on gas issues on 
Tuesday.  I've got a draft of the message points you circulated on 9.28 
regarding "why gas prices have increased" (have those changed?); I've got Ken 
Lay's gas presentation before the National Governor's Conference (9.20.00); 
and Gil Muhl's presentation to the AGA  in Washington D.C. on 9.19.00.  Are 
there other presentations that would useful to look at in preparation for the 
talk?

Finally, rest assured, you're the best resource anyone could hope for on gas 
issues anywhere in Enron.  If it seems like I've bugged you less recently 
it's because 1) I feel like I've bugged you a lot--too much--over the past 
couple of years and don't want to wear out my welcome and 2) with the 
electricity crisis in California and the start-up of Broadband, my attention 
has been less focused on gas.  Though that will change soon, since as you may 
have heard, PG&E's "Gas Accord" is coming to an end and we've got to figure 
out where to go from here.  (You'll be hearing from me in the near future on 
that issue, since I'll need to get a company-wide view of what we want to 
happen out here in the West.)

Look forward to seeing you again real soon.

Best,
Jeff
