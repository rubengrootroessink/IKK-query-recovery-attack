Aleck:

I'll take a look at it.  If I have any comments, I'll forward them along.  
Also, I may forward along some very slight changes to the numbers on the 
ISO's RFP "experience," should you decide you want to incorporate those 
"lessons" into your presentation. I'll provide any amendments to those 
numbers by tomorrow.

Best,
Jeff
