You're right, Sue.  Rates can't go up w/out declaring the rate freeze over in 
some fashion---trying to finesse it.  Thanks very much for the comments.  
Harry also had a good comment---don't specify the amount of rate increase in 
our comments; rather note that the rate increase needs to be well-reasoned 
and based on facts and evidence.  Will make that change.

Jeff,

This looks good.  It comes across as moderate in tone-- although probably no 
one else will ask to leave the rate freeze in place. 

I have a legal question -- Under AB 1890, I don't see anyway that the CPUC 
can raise rates without ending the rate freeze first.  Am I missing 
something? So, how is it clear that the CCPUC can raise the rates on Feb 1?  
It's clear,however,  that once the retained assets are valued that the rates 
can be changed.
