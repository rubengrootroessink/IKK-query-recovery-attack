FYI:

Sue stopped by and wanted to discuss your email re: launching missiles over 
email to the world.  

I told her that 1) folks are understandably sensitive regarding the info that 
gets to commercial folks, 2) she should continue sending those notes out and 
3) she should restrict the distribution list for such notes to GA, which 
gives the team a chance to discuss the issues and to decide what info to push 
out to commercial folks, and avoids rather everyone just willy-nilly sending 
out notes and potentially getting commercial folks whipped up into an 
(unintentional and  unnecessary) frenzy.  I think she took it well and I 
think she'll make a practice.  Only time will tell.
