No.  The decision would have prevented the Commission from implementing the 
legislation that prohibits direct access, at least during the time that 
Legislature and the direct access coalition work together to try to come up 
with a compromise to continue to allow direct access.  So all this means is 
that the prohibition still has not been implemented and there currently is 
nothing before the commission to implement.  Sure would have been nice if the 
commission had passed it, though.

Also, did I tell you that i'm in a meeting all day tomorrow in houston and 
therefore can't do an update call with edward's?  i can, however, do it on 
monday.

best,
jeff

Does this mean that the Commission has, de facto, prohibited direct access?  
If so, when is it effective?

Subject: PUC Approves DWR Language in Decision; Removes Language Staying 
Commission Action on Direct Access

The Commission just voted out one half of the "Bilas Alternate."

The decision that got voted out included Bilas' DWR-based language stating 
that the PUC 1) would not second-guess DWR purchases and 2) would pass 
through DWR costs to customers.
However, in a move led by Commissioner Carl Wood, the decision removed the 
Bilas language on Direct Access.  The decision therefore did NOT include the 
Bilas language staying any Commission action on implementing the Direct 
Access prohibition.  Carl Wood called including Direct Access "the height of 
arrogance."  
The decision was voted out 3-2, with the 2 remaining Republicans dissenting.
That said, the Commission has no proposal before it implementing the 
prohibition, and there was no talk at the meeting of implementing the 
prohibition any time soon.

Best,
Jeff
