Did we (GA) recommend the extension?  If so, nice recommendation.  Given the 
circumstances, it's a win-win, and still leaves us with the swaption to 
exercise at a later date.  Hope all is well. When I call, you're always in a 
meeting.  I will be on the leadership call tomorrow.  Hope you're well.

Best,
Jeff

Given the status of Phase I of DWR possibly being extended to the end of 
April, we will not be circulating a DASH at this time for the five-year DWR 
swaption.  Will advise at a later date of any developments.

Thanks all for your help for now.

Regards,
Tracy
