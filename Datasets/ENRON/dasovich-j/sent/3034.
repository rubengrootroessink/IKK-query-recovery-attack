		 Subject: UC Economists (and others) Step Out a Bit in California

One of the things that came out of the meeting I was at on Saturday with the 
UC economists (including Tyson and Yellen) was a "manifesto" that they 
published today (I'll have the final to distribute soon).  They're having a  
press conference in about 10 minutes at Berkeley.  In anticipation, they're 
quoted in a story in today's LA Times (that features Greenspan's comments) 
and they focus their quotes on the need to raise rates.  Most of these folks 
in the group, lamentably, earn their living by consulting for incumbents, but 
there message here should be helpful, and there are a few "right-minded" 
economists in the bunch.  (I managed to get Dr. Michaels in the group, who 
was a great voice of reason in the debate over what to say in the manifesto.) 
 It wasn't appropriate for me to play a visible role in the design of the 
manifesto, though I attempted to offer some behind the scenes suggestions.

It seems this is already getting press.  Click on the following to see the 
Los Angeles Times story.  Fortunately the LA Times did not focus on any of 
the issues we are debating here.
