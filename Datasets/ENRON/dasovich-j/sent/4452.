Hi folks:
Well, I ended up traveling ALL week, which I wasn't happy about.  Worse, some 
nimrod Enron IT person in Houston (where I was for part of the time) deleted 
my entire *&$*(!*-ing hard disk (which stupidly, I hadn't backed up)---year's 
worth of work and school gone, kaputt.  Anyway, if there's any chance that 
someone has all of the cases that we did and could email them to me, I would 
be greatly indebted.  Sorry for the inconvenience, and see you on Monday.

Best,
Jeff
