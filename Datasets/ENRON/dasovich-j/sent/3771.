On 2/14, the Southern California Generator Coalition filed a petmod asking
that the Commission amend winter balancing rules to allow customers to
bring more gas into the system than the 10% imbalance rules permit and that
customers be allowed to use the previous month's accumulated positive
imbalance in lieu of flowing supplies.

The generator members of WPTF with facilities in southern California may be
interested in knowing that TURN's 3/15 comments recommend instead that the
Commission should rebundle the costs of storage for electric generators in
their transportation rates and requires SoCalGas to store gas on behalf of
those customers.

Let me know if you want to see the TURN comments.
