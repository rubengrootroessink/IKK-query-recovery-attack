Hi:
Hope you had a nice weekend.  Sorry I missed you all in Washington.  Rick's 
asked me to attend the meeting at the Woodlands tomorrow.  Do we have a list 
of attendants/agenda?  No big deal, but would help me in preparing for the 
meeting.  I'm assuming that the meeting takes place tomorrow only?  I'm 
staying through Wednesday, nonetheless, and have booked a room at the 
Lancaster.  But if the meeting's going to continue through Wed, I was 
wondering if I should be staying at the Woodlands.  Thanks (as always) for 
you help.

Signed,
Clueless
