Dear John:
You're opening my flood gates, and I'm going to refrain from getting entirely 
upset.  

Please read the attached letter, which is the one that we sent to Dunn last 
week.  To wit:  according to the ISO's own calculations, Enron represents 
FOUR TENTHS OF ONE PERCENT--that's four-tenths of one percent---of the 
alleged "overcharges."  John, combined, the government sellers, including CA 
munis have, by the ISOs own calculations, "overcharged" California by a 
factor of ONE HUNDRED times what Enron has alleged to have "overcharged."  
(See letter from Winters to Burton and Ose.)

So notes like this, are ill-informed.  I'm looking forward to Mr. Marcus and 
others directing their invective at SMUD, Glendale, Pasadena, Burbank and 
LADWP.  Nettie Hoge is now being quoted as saying, "well, it's not the 
gouging.  that's not the problem.   it's the "profit motive" we've set up 
that's the problem."  so munis are victims of a disease (profits) they can't 
control.  everyone else is blood-sucking scum.  (in addition, please inform 
Bill that Sempra's contract with DWR is a drop in the bucket compared to 
others.  it's easy and perhaps even good politics to go after Sempra, but 
getting Sempra ain't going to come within a light year of solving our DWR 
contract problem.)

Sorry for the flame, but it's gotten extremely tiresome, and  it ain't 
personal; but the emperor has no clothes, which will increasingly become 
increasingly apparent.

all that aside, we've got other work that's more important, and i look 
forward to continue working on it. 

best,
jeff

>
> By Holly Bailey

> As Congress this week moves to take up major elements of President
> Bush's embattled energy policy, members of the administration,
> including Vice President Dick Cheney and Environmental Protection
> Agency chief Gail Norton, fanned out across the country yesterday
> in hopes of increasing national support for the plan.

> push for Bush's energy plan.
>
> At least three separate coalitions have launched TV, radio and
> print ads in recent weeks pushing for a new national energy policy,
> one that emphasizes the need to expand domestic oil and gas production,
> pipelines and power grids. Few of the groups mention the White
> House or Bush by name, but their policy wish list includes all
> the major elements proposed by the president.
>
> Perhaps the most prominent group is the Alliance for Energy and
> Economic Growth, a coalition of more than 400 groups including
> chambers of commerce, trade associations, energy companies and
> various other interest groups. Formed in mid-May, the Alliance's
> founding members include the American Gas Association ($630,025
> in soft money, PAC and individual contributions during 1999-2000;
> 55 percent to Republicans); the Edison Electric Institute ($739,378;
> 60 percent to Republicans); the National Mining Association ($508,650;
> 83 percent to Republicans); the Nuclear Energy Institute ($334,716;
> 71 percent to Republicans) and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce ($515,499;
> 94 percent to Republicans).
>
> The group's ads, which feature soft-focus photography shots including
> young children standing with their parents and sailors saluting
> a waving American flag, emphasize that our national security
> could be at risk without a new energy policy. The price tag for
> the Alliance's current ad campaign: at least $1 million, according
> to the Washington Post.
>
> Former Bush campaign advisers are the principals behind two other
> groups. The American Taxpayers Alliance, headed by GOP consultant
> Scott Reed, spent a reported $2 million last month running ads
> pinning blame for the California energy crisis on the state's
> Democratic governor Gray Davis. Reed, who also chaired Bob Dole's
> 1996 presidential race, won't disclose the donors or members
> of his group, but, according to Time magazine, one donor is Reliant
> Energy ($584,606; 87 percent to Republicans). Reliant is one
> of the companies accused by California officials of price gouging.
>
> Meanwhile, Ed Gillespie, a Bush adviser and Washington lobbyist
> whose clients include the energy giant Enron, heads the 21st
> Century Energy Project, a coalition formed to counter "enviro-leftist
> propaganda," according to a press release. The group's nine members
> include mainly conservative groups, led by the American Conservative
> Union ($112,500; all to the GOP). This week, the group reportedly
