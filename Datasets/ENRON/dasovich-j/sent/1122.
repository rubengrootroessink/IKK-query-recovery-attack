Here are IEP's comments on caps.  It's from a draft circulated last Friday,=
=20
but just spoke with Smutney, and he said that the comments did not change=
=20
substantively .  Very briefly, "IEP is generally opposed to caps, but if=20
FERC's going to go with a soft cap, 1) there's a lot of clarification neede=
d,=20
2) it needs to include "upward ratchet," a la Heber and 3) it must be linke=
d=20
with other reforms (i.e., forward contracting, siting, retail markets,=20
etc.)."  The comments do not explicitly address the level of the cap.  They=
=20
also call for a technical conference.

Anything to add, Sue?

B. Issues Concerning Implementation of the =01&Soft Cap.=018 =20

IEP has concerns about the implementation of the =01&soft cap=018 proposal.=
  IEP=20
has not and does not support price caps because it impedes the operation of=
=20
the market and distorts price signals.  Such mechanisms should have no plac=
e=20
in competitive markets in the long-run.  The Staff Report notes that caps d=
o=20
not work. Citation; Also MSC,   IEP is concerned, as are others, that the=
=20
soft cap proposal will fail to attract new investments in supply or foster=
=20
meaningful demand response.   It is particularly problematic in terms of=20
attracting new capacity that will operate as peaker units for a limited=20
number of hours when weather-induced demand cannot be met from less expensi=
ve=20
units or imports. Notwithstanding the apparent opinion of SMUD otherwise,=
=20
there are demands which materialize only for a fraction of a percentage of=
=20
the total hours of a year, and therefore some resources will only be=20
dispatched a short number of hours to meet that need.  These resources tend=
=20
to be fast ramping, less efficient units that are not designed or intended =
to=20
operate as =01&baseload=018 facilities.  Hence the suggestion that they =01=
&just=20
operate more=018 to recover their costs is misplaced. =20
The soft cap also appears to be especially problematic to power marketers w=
ho=20
make wholesale purchases for subsequent resale but who may not own the=20
underlying physical generation assets.  These entities have a major role in=
=20
the marketplace in terms of bringing demand and supply together and they se=
ek=20
return on the risks they undertake.  These entities will perceive the =01&s=
oft=20
cap=018 as a =01&hard cap=018 which will chill their participation in Calif=
ornia,=20
particularly when regional supplies become tight and expensive.  This=20
unintended consequence must be avoided or the markets will be hobbled. =20
IEP echoes the concern articulated by the CAISO that the soft cap proposal=
=20
may divert or require additional ISO resources.    It will clearly compound=
=20
the settlement processes at the CAISO as transactions above the soft cap wi=
ll=20
require additional tracking and segregation to allow for potential=20
=01&unwinding=018 should the bids be disallowed.  It will also require some=
 form of=20
new software to provide for potential calculation of the weighted averaged=
=20
prices suggested in the November Order, presumably in 10-minute increments,=
=20
to blend with the market clearing prices established in the various markets=
. =20
Moreover, if that averaged price associated with bids above the cap is=20
modified often, then CAISO will be required to =01&re-run=018 settlements o=
r=20
undertake subsequent settlement adjustments.  It is possible that these=20
efforts=01*which are suggested as temporary measures in the November Order=
=01*would=20
take away from CAISO=01,s efforts at developing solutions to longer-run pro=
blems=20
in terms of software modifications/development.  At first blush the details=
=20
regarding implementation of the soft cap proposal are not straightforward a=
s=20
currently described, and any further exploration this approach will at leas=
t=20
require a =01&technical conference=018 to clarify the mechanics and to ensu=
re that=20
it can be done in a reasonable manner. =20
IEP could only support the soft cap proposal if it is part of a negotiated=
=20
package of inter-jurisdictional programs, and provided that it is subject t=
o=20
an pre-established unidirectional escalation mechanism, or a similar one-wa=
y=20
mechanism that is tied to the development of new capacity within the WSCC. =
=20
The inter-jurisdictional elements must include:
? establishment of standards applicable to potential refunds based on=20
allegations of market power abuse in FERC jurisdictional markets;=20
? definition of durable reasonableness review standards applicable to=20
wholesale purchases by the load serving utilities such that they will no=20

is;
? establishment of a =01&road map=018 by the California Commission that del=
ineates=20
a firm timeline=01*with milestones=01*for the review and resolution of reta=
il=20
market issues including market-based demand responsiveness;

CAISO, that delineates a firm timeline=01*with milestones=01*for the review=
 and=20
resolution of implementation issues associated with the Commission=01,s=20
subsequent order in this docket as well as other outstanding proposals such=
=20
as generation interconnection rules and congestion management;
? establishment of firm sunset date, not to exceed 2003, to bound the=20

pre-established schedule or tied to increases in installed capacity within=

=09=09 Subject: Enron's Response Today - Key Point to Focus On

As I've been thinking about our response today, I would like Enron to focus=
=20
on making sure that the California (WSCC) markets are as good a possible fo=
r=20
business over the next 15 to 24 months.  Following that idea, I think that=
=20
the key points are (1) clarifying/raising the soft cap and (2) reducing the=
=20
burden/risk of the prospective refund period.

I know that we had discussed leading off with the debate over market power =
/=20
retroactive refunds, but I think that (a) FERC is not inclined to do much=
=20
more on this issue, (b) FERC wants to fix the market as much as it can give=
n=20
the current political realities, and (c) if retroactive refunds become an=
=20
issue, we still have our full compliment of resources to later fight this=
=20
fight.

I would recommend that the pleading and Alan's testimony be modified to bri=
ng=20
these issues to the top of the ticket.   We should still include all of our=
=20
other arguments.

Finally, I want to make sure that Enron is taking the right position by=20
quietly supporting a $250/Mwh soft cap with safe harbor fixes?  Sue Mara, c=
an=20
you please try and find out what EPSA, IEPCA, and WPTF are going to file?  =
I=20
want to make sure that we are in the ball park on this issue but not gettin=
g=20
too soft.
