Mark, Congratulations on the story in the Times.

FYI.  Today's radio media (local and national) are all giving the same basic 
message that:

"Davis got beat up in FERC negotiations; judge sides decidedly with 
generators; Davis team trying in vain to spin it their way, but it's clear 
they lost. "

Freeman was pathetic on the radio this morning.  Interviewers weren't buying 
his BS at all.

Best,
Jeff
