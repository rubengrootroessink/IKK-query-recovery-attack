I think that it's a good idea.  The only red flag is the perception of 
marketers being in the same room together.  However, from my perspective, 
though it's a significant concern, it's one that can be addressed.  I would 
suggest running the notion by Sanders and Yoder to get their take.

Best,
Jeff
