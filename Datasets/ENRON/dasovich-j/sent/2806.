This is material that I received re: Nord Pool from Davies (one of 
Schroeder's guys).  If you want to take a wack at putting together a few 
bullets on what Nord Pool is, how it differs from Cal model and why it's 
preferable, that would help me immensely and free me up to focus on 1) 
comments to Gov's proposal and 2) more detail on demand buy-down.  That 
possible?  Let me know.  Greatly appreciated.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff,

A couple of presentations attached which give you some quick info comparing 
the Nordic market to others, notably UK.  The first is a presentation 
prepared for our Mexcian colleagues 18 months ago, drawing out key features 
and success factors in selected liberalised markets, including Nord Pool.  
The second overlaps a little with the first in terms of Nordic content and 
compares the NP arrangements to the existing and proposed new UK 
arrangements.  This one is over 2 years old now.  I would urge caution in 
using both of them to the extent that they are (particularly the latter) a 
little dated now.

One very good non-Enron comparative source (although again not completely up 
to date), (sorted by market design issue rather than by market but including 
plenty on Nord Pool) can be found at http://www.ofgem.gov.uk/elarch/aback.htm
.    Open the document dated Feb 98, comparing trading arrangements in "other 
countries" (than UK).   This was prepared by the regulator in the early phase 
of the redesign of the UK market.

Let us know if you need more help.

Regards
Philip Davies
