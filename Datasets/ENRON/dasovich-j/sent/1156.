Oh come on.  I heard that you're a ghost writer for Harvey's proposal!  

Kidding.  

Seriously, it's been great discussing these issues on panels with you 
lately.  I have a picture of the two of us from the Berkeley conference I'll 
pass along to you.  

I really think there's a way out of all this without dropping a nuclear bomb 
on all of the hard work folks have done thus far to restructure the 
industry.  Look forward to working on it.

Best,
Jeff

P.S. Don't have TOO much fun dangling the initiative in front of the likes of 
Peace and the IOUs.

		 Subject: Re: Proposed initiative on energy issue

FYI--  Despite strong urging, TURN did NOT join in the press conference or 
the initiative proposal referenced in this message.  Obviously we may have 
no choice but to do so in the future, depending upon how FERC, the 
Governor, the Legislature and the CPUC react to the unfolding crisis.  For 
now, we will continue to work for reasonable regulatory and legislative 
solutions that protect small ratepayers from the consequences of a debacle 
that they never asked for or wanted.   I am plannning to attend Friday's 
meeting of the group (unless I am disinvited) so that we can discuss 
constructive ways of making that happen.   MIKE
