Hi Scott:  

Thanks for the note.  Hope things are well.  I'd like to call the El Paso 
person if that works for you.  Yep, moratorium's still in place (at least to 
build your own---you can always get someone who previously received authority 
to do it for you).  I'll keep you posted.

Best,
Jeff

If you are still trying to pull utilities and such together to approach the
California regulatory bodies, El Paso would be interested in joining the 
effort.
I work with Bryan Neskora and Bruce Northcutt with El Paso Global Networks.  
El
Paso is trying to install fiber along their pipeline ROW starting in Los 
Angeles
through Phoenix, Tucson, El Paso, Houston.  I believe they are having
difficulties on the regulatory side.  Bryan gave me the following name in the
regulatory group:

Kim Corley
713-420-5610
Houston

Bryan said to feel free to give her a call.  Hope this helps.

I also understand we still haven't received permitting build.  Is moratorium
still in place?
