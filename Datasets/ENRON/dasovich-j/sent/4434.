RE:         Friday, May 4 meeting at 1:30 pm in the CMTA conference room
to discuss Windfall Profits Tax bills

Due to a scheduling conflict, we are changing our Thursday, 2:00 pm
meeting to Friday, May 4 at 1:30 pm.

As most of you are aware, CMTA is opposing legislation designed to
impose a Windfall Profits Tax on electricity generator
companies.  The bills are SBX1 1 (Soto) and ABX1 128 (Corbett).  Please
note that the Soto bill pertains to co-generators as
well as entities exclusively in the power business.  That means that
many of you would be directly effected.  The other primary
basis for opposition is that the bills would inhibit electrical supply.
Please also note that, to the extent that SBX1 1 (Soto) were
operative, it would impose the "windfall cost" on business taxpayers who
would fund the credit given to personal income tax
taxpayers.

You are invited to our lobbying strategy meeting which will be here at
CMTA's offices at 980 9th Street, Suite 2200
on Friday, May 4 at 1:30 pm.  Please RSVP to Pam Ross at 916-498-3320 or
pross@cmta.net.

There is a call in number as follows:
