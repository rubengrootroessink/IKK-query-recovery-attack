Bob:  

I want to let you know that I stand in awe of someone who has the balls to 
open for someone as talented as Dan B.  It demonstrates that you're one 
talented guy yourself.  Congratulations.  Your show was great, and it was 
good to see you.   Best of luck on the rest of the tour.

Best,
Jeff
