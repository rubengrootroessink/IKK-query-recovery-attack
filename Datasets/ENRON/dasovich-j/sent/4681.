No word from Steve.  Ken thought the meetings were very worthwhile, though he 
was pooped by the time he got to the airport.  We laughed (cried?) about 
Riordan during the car ride.

Best,
Jeff

I like it!  Thanks for doing such a great job cleaning it up and improving it 
(i was far from coherent last night...)  Have you gotten any feedback from 
Steve?  Ken had wanted us to send this out today.  If not, we need to send it 
out Monday unless Steve has objections.  Any word?

Did Ken say anything about the meeting yesterday on your way to the airport?  
Yesterday was much too long a day.  I'm going to crash early tonight and will 
probably sleep thru the weekend.

talk soon.
