Think the 6-8 months is baloney.  Can you verify?

Bill,
Info...in recent talks SCE ventured the opinion that based on thier alleged
experience it would take 6 or 8 months to get a new contract cycled thru the
CPUC for approval and implementation.  If this is true (which I doubt) it
could impact on the operational capability of our PDA which expires in 7
months.  Do you folks agree it could not happen quicker.  If need be, do you
know any strategy for getting thru that process quicker?
Paul
