Gee, and at $120/bottle, I can load up on a few cases.  At that price, the 
Mondavi's must be hoping Bush wins so America can spend the tax break on 
that tasty Reserve.  (Kidding!) 
Do you qualify for the discount on the Reserve, too? 
GO RALPH!

     1997 Robert Mondavi Winery Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon Reserve 
     (Exceptional) - Epitomizes Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon, the grape 
     that is the backbone of America's most important wine district. Even 
     at Robert Mondavi, which has produced its share of impressive cabs, 
     the 1997 reserve stands out. The 1997 vintage was the best of the 
     1990s in the Napa Valley, yielding rich, concentrated red wines. 
     Robert Mondavi Reserve's showy aromas of spice, cassis, and cedar make 
     a strong impression in the glass. On the palate, the wine is deeply 
     layered with pure dark-berry fruit flavors, has firm, ripe tannins and 
     an ultra-smooth finish with superb length. ($120)

     1997 Robert Mondavi Winery Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon Reserve - 
     (91) Very tight nose, with blackberry, coffee and cocoa notes, this is 
     a big wine that shows great intensity and depth. Quite closed now, the 
     dark profile keeps its cards close to the vest. One thing for sure: 
     this definitely one for the cellar. The finish is lengthy, with brisk 
     tannins as well as espresso and bitter-chocolate notes. Hold for eight 
     to ten years; this wine should keep till 2020. ($120)

     1997 Opus One Napa Valley Red Wine (100) -- Could the 1997 Opus One be 
     that elusive wine that one never finds? In my continual pursuit for 
     wine nirvana, I have traveled to Bordeaux and back with stops in Italy 
     and Australia and for what? Besides losing my luggage, tracking 
     through customs and using non-functional phone cards, I have been 
     searching for that wine of perfection. Could this wine finally be the 
     one? This just released Opus One may be the absolute finest young red 
     wine I have ever tasted in a bottle (barrel samples don't count). 
     Aristocratically structured the 1997 Opus One magnificently perfumes 
     the air with aromas of ripe, succulent fruit, fragrant, sweet earth 
     and delicate, white flowers. Persistent to the point of perfection, 
     this wine does not allow its captive audience to escape its web of 
     Cabernet ecstasy. Made with the five important varietals of Bordeaux 
     (82% Cabernet Sauvignon, 8% Cabernet Franc, 5% Merlot, 4% Malbec, and 
     1% Petit Verdot), this spellbinding wine commands attention. This is 
     my top wine of the year. (Best Served 2002-2018). ($130)
