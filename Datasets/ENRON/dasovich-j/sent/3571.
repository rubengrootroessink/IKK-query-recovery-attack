As ususal, there's another crisis today.  I'll be able to do the call, but we 
need to keep it brief.  Apologies.  What's the cal-in number?  Thanks.

Paul, I just found out that Jeff Dasovich has been called to a meeting in
Houston, and will be out all day tomorrow.  He is available on Monday.  Can
we do our conference call at 0900?  I have asked him to confirm the time.
I have to leave for Ft Leavenworth at 1030 hrs on Monday, so 0900 works
well for me.  Hope it works at your end.

Regards,
Bill
