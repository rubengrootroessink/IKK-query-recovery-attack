That's so weird.  Prentice left her car door ajar (when she went to go to 
school yesterday morning, it was dead and she had to get a jump).  

I was surprised that the phone was only 300 pesos.  I thought they'd charge 
by the minute, but apparently, it's a flat 10 pesos for local (i.e., 800 
calls), no matter how long one's one.

I left the car light on - battery totally dead!  Freezing cold in SF - no
coats - landed at 9 pm - home at 12:30 am.  ugh!!!  300 pesos is just the El
Cid part of the bill - I think the rest will be on your card.  Eldon
actually got them to adjust some of that off as well cuz he said your
connection kept going off.   I say "If only life always gave us credits when
our connections went off!"

The entire phone bill is 300 pesos???  Yes, please fax to me.  And please
email me rest of expenses when you get a chance so I can write you a check
for everything (plane,phone, golf, etc., etc.)

You guys get back OK?
