Here's the DG stuff from the Hertzberg letter

Key Barriers to the Development of Distributed Generation and Proposals to=
=20
Remove the Barriers

Barrier:  Excessive and Unnecessary Utility Stand-by Charges

Solution
The executive orders issued by the Governor on February 14th took a step in=
=20
the right direction, but don=01,t go nearly far enough.  Utility stand-by=
=20
charges have always been designed by the utilities to protect their monopol=
y=20
position, extract monopoly prices from customers, or both.  They must be=20
eliminated for all distributed generation applications.  There is no reason=
=20
to limit the elimination of these charges to generation facilities that are=
=20
less than 1MW.  These limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it=
=20
takes for California to close the significant gap between supply and demand=
=20
and reduce the risk of black outs this summer.=20

The provisions of SB27X eliminating stand-by charges were stripped from the=
=20
bill.  This will likely thwart any attempts to encourage the near-term=20
development of distributed generation and reduce the severe supply-demand=
=20
imbalance in California.

The language eliminating stand-by charges should be re-inserted into SB27X=
=20
and modified to remove all caps on plant size.=20
=20
Barrier: Excessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities=
=20
with investor-owned and municipal utilities

Solution:  =20
The Governor=01,s executive order regarding interconnection is a step in th=
e=20
right direction=01*D-D-26-01 requires utilities to complete interconnection=
=20
studies within 7 days.  California should ensure that this requirement=20
applies to all generation facilities, including distributed generation.  In=
=20
addition, the financial conflicts the utilities face when interconnecting=
=20
generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome through executive=
=20
orders or other regulations. =20

To the greatest extent possible, California should shift control over=20
interconnection away from the utility and place that control with the=20
California ISO.  This could be accomplished through amendments to SB 27X.

Barrier:  Permitting and Air Quality Issues
Developers of distributed (i.e., =01&on-site=018) generation that is 50 MWs=
 or=20
greater must receive certification from the California Energy Commission an=
d=20
therefore face all of the impediments to development that large-scale=20
generation faces. =20

Solution:=20
California should ensure that the executive orders (D-22-01 thru D-26-01)=
=20
issued by the Governor to expedite plant siting and maximize plant output=
=20
apply equally to smaller scale, =01&distributed generation=018 facilities. =
In=20
addition, distributed generation that is less than 50 MWs continues to face=
=20
local opposition.  The State should ensure that local, parochial interests=
=20
cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects. =20

These objectives could be accomplished through amendments to SB27X.
