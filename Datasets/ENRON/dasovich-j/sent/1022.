Lisa:  Sorry, but Joseph's gone on vacation for the week.  I think that the 
size of the group is going to require that we do this offsite.  We use the 
"Park Hyatt" in San Francisco.  Could you check with Paul and let him know 
that I think that we need to go offsite, given the size of the crowd, and if 
he agrees, could you go ahead and check into getting a room at the Park 
Hyatt?  As always, I'm greatly indebted.  If there are any problems, or if 
you have any questions, don't hesitate to give me a call.

Best,
Jeff

Per Rick Shapiro, pllease be advised that the meeting referenced above has 
been changed as follows:

Date: Tuesday, December 5th
Time: 9:00am - 1:30pm Pacific
Where: San Francisco Office

At this time, Paul would prefer to keep this as an internal GA meeting with 
our outside lobbyists.  At this time we are not inviting the Enron Business 
units to attend, but please feel free to invite anyone else in the GA group 
you feel should attend.  

HOWEVER, if you invite someone else, please advise me so that we can ensure 
we have adequate space in San Francisco to accommodate everyone.  Thanks!

Melissa Cortez - please forward to Scott AND Hedy.  Also, I will forward 
directions to our offices to you under a separate e-mail.
