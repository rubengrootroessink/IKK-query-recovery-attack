Hi Justin:

As we discussed, this is the most recent version of the proposed "fix" to the 
Direct Access prohibition included in AB1X that the coalition of customer 
groups have been working on.  They intend to give it to Debra Bowen first 
thing next week.  Take a look at it and if you have any questions, please let 
me know and I can explain the concept and how it is intended to work.  I have 
notified the coalition that it would be a good thing to include you on their 
distribution list, but I didn't want to do that until I checked with you. Let 
me know if that's something that you would like to do.

Best,
Jeff
