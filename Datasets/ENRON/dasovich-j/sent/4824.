Good luck with everything!!

Hope you guys had a wonderful weekend at the dome.  Is the deck completely
finished now??  Vegas was awesome, of course.  I ended up a couple hundred
or so.  Craps was king.



On the business side?WE MUST CLOSE THIS DEAL WITH ENRON.  This is SO
important for us.  It looks like things really went well and they have our
pilot proposal.  Is there ANYTHING you can do??  Anything to get to someone
who is a part of this group and just say random great things about us or
help move it forward.  We have to close two deals before the next board
meeting (4 weeks out) or we have to downsize again.  It won't be pretty.
Is there anyone you know or who might know someone to help this out?  Maybe
you get Lay to put a little pressure on.  Ha!



Back to the personal?PP wanted to have a steak dinner to try out the knives
early this week.  How about tomorrow night?  I'll make a nice mushroom
sauce??

FYI on the Enron mtg...  I'll catch up with Jeff early next week, talk to
him about the mtg, and strategize on next steps.  I think we have a
legitimate chance to do something with this group at Enron, and need to
assess where Jeff can help without complicating the decision-making process
in the near-term.

Subject: Enron Demo Recap

Here's a recap of our demo meeting with Enron's Global Strategic Sourcing
group on Tuesday...



Demo went well.  In attendance for Perfect were Ian, James M and David Y.
Enron's attendees were:


- John Gillespie - Sr Director GSS - Platforms & Processes (decision maker)
- Pam Tragesser - GSS Operations Mgr (asst to Derryl C - Sr Dir GSS -
Operations)
- John Will - Director Sourcing - Pipe Valves & Fittings
- Craig Brown - Director Sourcing - Chemicals, Oils & Lubricants
- Shirley Jo Dickens-Wilson - Enron Transportation Services Procurement Mgr
- Eugene Ribaudo - Enron Energy Services Procurement Mgr - ibuyit.com team
lead
- Ken Sommers - Enron Energy Services Procurement Mgr



Despite only having 1 hour to present, Ian competently ran through a
company and feature overview, then blasted through a demo of PS2 and PPD.
We did not get to show PI.  They all bought in that this was a
sophisticated sourcing tool, that it followed their processes and would
help streamline their operation.  Only negatives we heard was that the $1M
price tag was a show stopper, and that they were trying to minimize RFQs
and focus on release against agreements.  With 2000 revs at over $100B, and
a spend to match that, their ROI would be tremendous.



Shirley Jo said that her primary use of this system would be for any
purchase over $50k, which requires 3 bids.  She does not feel that she has
enough of these events to justify implementation in her ETS group.



Their current processes are basically pen, paper, phone and fax.  They do
use RFQ templates and Excel spreadsheets.  They also model Total Cost of
Ownership - evaluating the total lifecycle of materials.



They are using their homegrown auction platform, DealBench, and were trying
to compare this against our system.  Their transaction fees for using the
DealBench system are minor, so our pricing looks high, but that would be
comparing apples against oranges.  I will address this in the cover letter
on the pilot proposal we will send.



Questions that came up included:


- What is the difference between maverick spend in Procurement vs Sourcing?
Ian responded Perfect reduces maverick spend during the sourcing cycle by
standardizing company best practices and providing
visibility/accountability of vendor selection criteria.

- How does the optimization calculation work?  Ian gave basic explanation
of input variables and ranking/scoring.  Don't feel we need to elaborate on
this at this point, possibly in future.

- Can we utilize a hands-on demo to play with the system?  We suggested a
pilot, but also said that it might be possible to work something out over
Webex just to test drive a little more before moving into a pilot.



We agreed that the next step is for us to send a pilot proposal and they
will get together either Friday or sometime next week to review the
proposal, discuss their opinions and determine the next step.


-----------------------



I sent the Pilot Proposal and cover letter out today by email after final
approval by Ian.  I will followup on Monday to find out what their
evaluation gameplan is and to suggest meetings so that we can get ROI
inputs to allow James to workup an ROI proposal.
