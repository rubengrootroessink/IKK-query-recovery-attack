In today's SF Chronicle, Rob Morse's column:

		

		
		Pac Bell Park has reopened with a lot fewer dot-com ads on the walls. But 
what's that ad on the scoreboard? In big letters it says "Enron." It's nice 
to see the Houston power company giving a little back for all the billions 
it's been gouging us.
