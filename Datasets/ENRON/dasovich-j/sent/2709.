Heres' the file.

Again, we used it, in the end, to justify having the utilities go out, now, 
and fill 10-15% of their net short position with 5 and 10 years deals.  The 
group agreed, though there's still discussions about the percentage (higher?) 
and the mix (5 and 10 year deals?; 3, 5, 10 year deals?)--you get the picture.

The guy from Edison who's been participating in the talks and agreed with our 
approach (understanding that the percentage and baskets are still negotiable) 
is John Fielder, SVP of regulatory affairs.

Good luck.

Best,
Jeff
