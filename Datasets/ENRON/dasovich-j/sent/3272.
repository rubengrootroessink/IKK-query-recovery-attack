		 Subject: California Legislation Info

Hey Leslie:

Sandi McCubbin told me that I should consult with you.  I am compiling 
information on legislation being considered in California as a result of the 
electrcity crisis for two main  purposes.  First, I need it for Steve Kean's 
briefing book as he is scheduled to meet with a federal legislative panel in 
California (Tauzin and Barton, +6 other Congressmen) on Wednesday, and 
second, I am going  to compile info on emergency legislation and CPUC 
proceedings in a central place for  knowledge management purposes.

Can you email me whatever information you may have on California 
legislation?  I would greatly appreciate it.  I will also give you a call to 
follow up.   Steve's leaving on Tuesday at Noon, so I need to get info 
together well before then.


Thanks

John
