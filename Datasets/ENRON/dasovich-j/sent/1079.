These performance reviews may push me right over the edge.

Good talking to you earlier.  Sounded like the Paul I know and admire.  You 
sounded energized.  Looking forward to having you around more.  

One thing.  Please don't count December out as a possible start time for the 
special session.  Anything can happen.  Book your hotel room early.

Best,
Jeff
