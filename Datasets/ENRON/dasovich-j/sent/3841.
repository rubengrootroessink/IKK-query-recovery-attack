Jeff -

On the call will be Scott Tomashefsky from the CEC and Daniel Poller from
McKinsey will be present as well, strictly in a background, secondary
capacity.  There may also be some members of the Resource Agency's Natural
Gas Working Group as well.  They were invited as a courtesy.  Hope this
answers your questions.  Thank you, again.

Regards,

Michele
