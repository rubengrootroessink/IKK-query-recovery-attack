I do plan on accompanying Steve.  Steve, you want me to bring the copies.  Be 
glad to.  What time does the party start?

Jeff:  will you accompany Steve?  If so, the Committee needs you to bring at 
least 75 copies of the attached testimony with you to give to the Committee 
Clerk to "satisfy the anticipatied public interest."  I would suggest you 
bring more.....
