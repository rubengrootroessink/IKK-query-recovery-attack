You're in luck!  The meeting's from noon to 1 pm CST, so you can attend.  Do 
you feel lucky?  Would you like to participate---the option's yours.  I'll 
invite Scott, too.  If you'd like to attend, should we call you from the 
conference room?  

Best,
Jeff

Calling in on the 2nd should be fine.  Sorry that it doesn't work for you to 
be there in person.

I'm going to be out of the office from about 3:00 this afternoon until 11:00 
tomorrow morning, EST.  If your meeting happens after 11:00 EST tomorrow, I 
would like to join by phone.   (But don't worry about scheduling around me if 
it's a problem).  Donald is on his way back from South America, and probably 
isn't available.  Scott may be available by phone and probably would be 
interested in participating.

Maybe the next person we hire should be a full-time schedule coordinator.   
Thanks for your enduring patience.

So it is the 2nd after all?  Thought it might be the first, which I could 
have made.  The 2nd doesn't work---have set up a meeting with ENA to meet 
with Sempra execs to see if a deal can be done (yeah, right).  But since it's 
that early on the 2nd, I can call in by conference call and attend the first 
90 minutes, or so.  Will that work?

In other exciting news, going to meet with the lawyers and Bowen either this 
afternoon or first thing in the morning tomorrow.  You want to join?  And 
should I see if Scott and/or Donald want to attend?  Just let me know.

Best,
Jeff
