Hey Tim:

Calger asked me recently to set up a meeting with Sempra to try to do a gas 
outsource deal.  We're meeting with the CFO and their Chief Reg Officer next 
Thursday.  On a call today, we thought--for a variety of reasons--that we 
ought to throw an electric commodity deal at them, too, while we're there.  
Laird Dyer's going to call you for indicative prices (same drill we did for 
Skilling).  If you have any questions, or want me to fill you in more, just 
give a holler, or check in with Chris.

Best,
Jeff
