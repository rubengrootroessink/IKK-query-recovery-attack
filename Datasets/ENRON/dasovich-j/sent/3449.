Thanks so much for responding, Sally.  Very interested in exploring the 
possibilities with you.  Greatly appreciated. 

Wow, that's the only other Jeff Dasovich I've ever heard of.  No kidding.  
Referred to you by Lee Green. Don't yet have soil test or temp profiles, but 
am in the process of figuring out how to get them done.  Any suggestions are 
welcome and appreciated.  I'll be around the weekend of March 10th.  If that 
works for you, great; otherwise, we can try another date.  

Again, can't thank you enough for responding.  I don't know where it'll lead, 
but I've got a hunch that it just might work out.

Enjoy drinking your wine (had the syrah recently) and very much look forward 
to meeting you.

All the best,
Jeff

Hi Jeff:
I know a Jeff Dasovich, exact spelling, an attorney in
Oklahoma City...I'm looking forward to talking to you about
the potential for vineyard. Please call me at 707-964-1155,
I zoom around pretty fast but should be able to get down
there soon. Do you have soil test results/temp profiles -
were you referred to me by Alan Green of Greenwood Ridge?  Sally
