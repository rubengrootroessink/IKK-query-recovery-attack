The notion that it would have to be a monthly analysis sounds like pure 
Roger, and could likely be correct.  But we need to determine whether we can 
get what we need by doing a "less precise" annual versus a "monthly."  Seems 
that once we've made that call, we direct the scenario and they do it.  
Thoughts?

Best,
Jeff

Any suggestions to expedite the process?

Robert,

Thanks for the note. A conference call at 12:30 pm PST would work for us.
However, on that call, we will not be able to present results of the
additional scenarios that you defined in your e-mail. The model that we
used was an annual rate model. The analysis that you are proposing would
require a monthly model, which would take additional time to develop.
Perhaps we should discuss this prior to the call at 2:30 pm CST. Roger and
I will give you a call when we get into the office on Wednesday morning.
This should be around 11 am CST.

Best regards,

Bill
