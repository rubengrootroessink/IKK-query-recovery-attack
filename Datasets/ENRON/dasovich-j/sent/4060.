Scott/Cameron:  

OK, wondering why there ain't no charges on your credit card from our 
FABULOUS trip to Squaw Valley?  I just found out that they're all on 
mine!!?!?!?   I had the best time up there, but I couldn't figure out how it 
coulda cost $1700.  Just called them to inquire.  They said:  There's no 
mistake those are all the carges for rooms 432 and 450.  They're sending 
receipts.  Unreal.

Best,
Jeff
