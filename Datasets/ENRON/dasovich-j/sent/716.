Unfortunately, I have to get on a plane and go to LA around that time.  If it 
works better, we can discuss on Tueday morning/early afternoon.  Just let me 
know.

Best,
Jeff

Hi Jeff,

Sounds good.  Thanks for staying on us with this one.  

Could we make the call a little later Monday?  11:00 Houston time would work 
better for me.

Sue

Greetings Folks:

Any chance of finalizing the California tariff Monday morning (have a call, 
say, 7:30/8:00 AM PDT)?  Let me know.  Hope all's well with all.

Best,
Jeff
