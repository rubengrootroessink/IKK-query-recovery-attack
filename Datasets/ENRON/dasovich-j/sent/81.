That's fine if you don't want to do the road, but please tell Eldon and I'll 
tell Jeff (my road guy).

We really cannot do the road at this point. 

Amber's address:? 25664 Carmel Knolls Road, Carmel, CA 93923.? She is 20 
years old on Sunday!. 

I wrote you because I am not sure if Prentice is getting e-mails. 

Remember that some of your stuff might still be outside if I don't remember 
to bring it in.? There is also a folder of pick sheets to take up to the dome 
and leave on my desk, so we have them when any of us are up there.

We'll send a card.? She's 19?? Well, if we have to, we'll take some 
tomotoes.....Taking the suit and (if Prentice permits) Annie, too. 

Could you discuss with Eldon whether you guys want to do the Dome road 
while my is doing my road at the end of the month??? He's going to fax me 
the estimate based on his visit when we were all up there last.? To be 
honest, the deck's got me pretty darned gun-shy about "projects" and this 
guy is really nice and I want to work with him for years to come.? He's 
pretty willing to do whatever you folks want, i.e., from Yugo-style road to 
Rolls Royce-style road.? And if you want to take a pass, that's of course 
great, too.? I just want to make sure it doesn't turn in to a 
cluster-you-know-what....Just let me know.

I don't know if Prentice will get the e-mail, Jeff - so could you try to 
help make sure this happens.? Sunday is Amber's birthday.? Since we will be 
at the Cubs game it would be great if you guys could send her a card. 

When you come to get your stuff, take all the tomatoes you want with you! 
Are you going to take Annie?
