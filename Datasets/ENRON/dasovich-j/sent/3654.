I'm having the same problem.  She states on the izio site that that the cases 
are in the reader.  they ain't.  if anyone has them and could fax them to me 
at 415.782.7854, would be greatly appreciated.

Best,
Jeff

Also, I like both ideas--Anil's and Mark's.  I think that we could discuss at 
break and write it up then and turn in at beginning of second half of class.  
I'd lean a bit toward the Amazon suggestion, but could go either way.

Greetings:

Sounds like I'm glad that I missed the quiz last week.

Hate to be a nag, but we've got to turn in what we're doing for our project
on Thursday.  I propose doing a nice, clean merger, which would allow us to
do both comparative analysis (who are these companies?) and
merger/valuation analysis.  Mark and I talked last night and I pleaded
again not to do strict accounting stuff, but if that's what folks would
like to do, I can certainly suck it up.  Any thoughts?

Best,
Jeff
