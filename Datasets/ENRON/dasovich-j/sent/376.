Hi and good morning.  Could you please book me a ticket for Portland.  Need 
to arrive in Portland on this coming Monday morning by 8-8:30 AM, and return 
to SF at around 4:30-5:00 PM on Tuesday.  Thanks very much.  Also, could you 
book me a hotel room at the 5th Avenue place (or whatever it's called).  
Muchos gracias.
