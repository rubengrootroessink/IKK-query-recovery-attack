From Kirsten's second report, sounds like the core/noncore is getting longer 
legs and moving more quickly.  I'm concerned about Bev speaking on our 
behalf---only because her knowledge base is quite low---and plan on phoning 
her to ensure that she has the message down pat.  Thoughts?

Also, I've forewarded the econ letter to Teece to see if we can get the 
"manifesto" group to respond.

Best,
Jeff
