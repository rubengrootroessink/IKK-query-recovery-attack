Greetings:
My apologies.  I was out of town over the weekend and while I thought I'd 
have network access, I didn't.  Here's the presentation from the talk I gave 
in New York on 01.29.01.  I'll be updating it, but will work from these 
slides (as notes--no formal presentation).

If you have any questions, just give a holler.  415.782.7822.  Look forward 
to meeting on Wednesday.

Best,
Jeff
