Hi Dale:

Please call me to discuss your question.  (415.782.7822)  Customers could try 
to "bypass" the utility, but until Dec. '95 (PUC final policy decision) and 
AB 1890, it was against the law to have direct access, so you may be 
misinterpreting the yellow book just a bit.  There were other forms of 
"bypass" at that time, but DA as we think of it today was illegal.  Give me a 
call and we can try to clear things up (specific references to where in the 
YB you're getting this impression will be helpful).    Glad to talk to you on 
Friday and be happy to talk more if you have any other questions, or desire 
any follow up.  

Best,
Jeff

Jeff, 
        The Yellow Book is in the mail. I read it over the weekend and found 
it to be a very good backgrounder for this whole thing. Thanks for lending it 
to me, and thanks again for your time Friday.
        A followup question: You had told me Friday that the arrival of QF's 
and other non-utility generators, including plants in neighboring states, had 
large customers chomping at the bit for competition, but frustrated because 
the big IOUs still controlled the grid and held the customers captive. But 
the Yellow book said that already some large customers had found ways to 
bypass the IOUs and get direct access/retail wheeling. 
        Could you explain? 
        Thanks, 
        Dale. 
PS - Please don't forget to call Steve Kean to let him know I'll be calling 
him. Thanks.
