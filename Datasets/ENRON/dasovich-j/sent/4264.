I love you very much and of course want to be together, but some things need 
to be worked out because there's too much depression and pain associated with 
those incidents.  They have to stop.  

I have never been embarrassed to be with you.  I'm as proud as can be.  I 
think that's something coming from within you that you need to work on, but 
I'm willing to help.

I don't want to end anything, but we need to fix it, or we'll have have to 
end it.  

I love you and miss you.

I just wanted to say again that I'm sorry about Friday night.  I'm sorry
about the way I acted and it was totally inappropriate.  It's also not how I
feel.  I don't feel animosity.  Sometimes I feel hurt because I feel like
sometimes you're embarassed to be associated with me.  But it's not
animosity and I'm sorry that that's the way I expressed it.  I love you and
I want us to be together and be happy.  I know I have some issues I need to
work on for that to happen and I'm willing to do that.  I'd rather do it
with you than alone.  If you want to end this relationship, I can't stop
you.  But I miss you and my life is very empty without you.
