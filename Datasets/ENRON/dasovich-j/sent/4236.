Not a problem.  My concern is less about you and me---we both have views and 
are comfortable with the back and forth banter.  

I'm actually concerned about Carolyn.  She has worked hard on this, and I 
think wants to be involved and participatory. I had the sense that she was 
feeling that she'd done a bunch of work that was ending up on the cutting 
room floor and that she wasn't getting a real opportunity to participate in 
the shaping of the analysis, the presentation, or responsibility for taking a 
piece of the presentation for Thursday.  I was sensing that she was 
frustrated.  

Anil is also less extroverted, but based on discussions with him, I think 
that he is less concerned because he has some other pretty cosmic things on 
his plate right now. 

My real concern is that everyone feels comfortable, understanding that 
working in groups is all about compromise, and that one should really expect 
to get about 70% or less of one's views included in a final product, given 
the nature of group dynamic.

I think we're getting close to something that everyone will good about, which 
is a pretty good goal to go after.

Thanks a bunch for the note.

Best,
Jeff

Hey Jeff,

I hope you don't take anything personally when I disagree with you.  You are
a
very bright guy and a good speaker with good ideas.  There are always going
to
be disagreements when you get 4 opinionated people together.  Anyway, please
get
me your numbers by tomorrow so I can spend Tuesday night plugging things in
and
getting the presentation in good working order.  I want Anil to take a final
crack at it Wednesday so everyone can give comments and be done by
Thursdsay.

Thanks.  Could you please send around the model, too?  I want to use for
the financials table.

Best,
Jeff
