Here's what I need (thanks, honey):

3 bags of fresh cranberries
2 oranges
box of brown sugar
6 jars of oysters
6 loaves of bread (get the "rounds" of bread---vary them, like olive bread, 
sour dough, sweet, whole grain, potato)
thing of celery
4 large yellow onions
couple bulbs of garlic
2 pounds of butter (clover, salted)

Thanks, sweetie, and good luck on your midterm!
