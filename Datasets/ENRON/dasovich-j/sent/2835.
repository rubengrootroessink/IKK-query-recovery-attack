Here's what we've delivered to Davis:
Message points on the "big picture"
Reasons that the Governor needs to broaden his information network (i.e., get 
better advice) and a proposal for how to do it
Comments on the Governor's proposals
Detail on how to execute the "buy-down" proposal
7X24, Peak and Off peak prices for 5-year blocks of power

The only thing left to send is the Nord Pool material, which Jim Steffes is 
help me to gather for delivery tomorrow.

Best,
Jeff
