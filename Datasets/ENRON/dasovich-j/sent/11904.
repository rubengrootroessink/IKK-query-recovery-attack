No intent to make people pay twice.  Anticipated that Edison might not want 
to be at risk for costs associated with retail gen service (e.g., AS, GMC, 
shaping) while only allowed to charge the wholesale price.  Any changes 
necessary to ensure no double counting are welcome.

Also, if 30 days seems to short to for some customers do strike a deal with 
either the utility or an ESP, then it might be appropriate, and I wouldn't 
object, to extending it to 90 days.  In my conversation with Dorothy, both 30 
and 90 came up.  90 is reasonable, but it would seem to be the uppermost  
limit.

Thanks very much for the comments.

Best,
Jeff

I do not agree with Jeff's changes to Dorothy's language and I am not sure if 
Dorothy does.
In particular, I don't know what is meant by the language in the definition 
of Spot Market
Service which says "and shall include all costs incurred by the electrical 
corporation to
provide retail electric service" which seems to me to go way beyond even 
energy service.  I
am also concerned that there be no way that customers have to pay for A/S 
twice.

Second, I think 30 days is too short a time for a customer on Spot Market 
service to elect
DA or Term Service, since if the UDC is providing Term Service on a best 
efforts basis, that
option might not even be available within 30 days.  Barbara
