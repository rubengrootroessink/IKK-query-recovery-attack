All,

Please find attached a memo providing an overview of the rights and
responsibilities of CLCs and NDIECs in California.  Also attached are the
referenced California code sections and those Commission decisions for which
we have an electronic version.  Let us know if you have any questions.

Please note that Jeff does not have access to his email, so he has asked
that one of you forward this message to Lara Leibman.

Thank you
Camille Estes
Blumenfeld & Cohen
