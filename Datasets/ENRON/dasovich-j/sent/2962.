Jeff- Sue-

On January 30 , an EES team is meeting with IBM in San Jose to cover a number 
f issues, related top the IBM contract.

It would be very helpful to the team if one of you could  attend the meeting 
and present Enrons perspective on the California situation

Could  you call  Jeff Nieland ( 713 345 9352) to let us know if you could 
participate.

We can fill you in on the details re: IBM  over the phone.
