The problem is not "deregulation." The fact is Oregon is not deregulated yet 
and rates are going through the roof. Also, one only needs to look back to 
1980-85 when rates in the Northwest went up 250% over a five year period 
because of nukes. This occurred in a fully regulated environment. 

The problem is that many consumers do not have a true choice to secure a 
fixed price long-term contract. 

You can not put the toothpaste back into the tube!  

I hope Enron takes the high road on this issue and pushes for expedited 
siting of new generation. The best way to accomplish this is to agree to 
compliance with emissions standards and meeting off-sets where they exist. 
Where off-sets do not exist, I think Enron can commit to paying for energy 
efficiency investments in partnership with utilities or industrial customers 
that take the out-put (or take equity) at our new plants. 

Paying for conservation, which is running about 19-22 mills in the Northwest, 
is a pretty inexpensive way to accomplish good will with end-users and 
utilities.
