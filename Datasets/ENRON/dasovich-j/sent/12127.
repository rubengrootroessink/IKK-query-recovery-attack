Please let me know if your company has, or will be cutting a check to
Edison to repay any discount received under interruptible program
contracts.

We are working on legislation that would allow companies to keep a
proportionate amount of the discount received between November 2000 and
January 26, 2001, based on the company's level of compliance when called
to curtail.

Thank you.
