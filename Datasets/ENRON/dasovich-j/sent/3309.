Joe/Sue:

We'll need to brief Steve on the fed/state issues tied to the state buying 
the TX systems of PG&E and Edison prior to his meeting with the Congressional 
Republicans tomorrow.  I'll be driving with Steve from  LA to Pasadena (where 
the meeting is) tomorrow beginning at about 9:30 AM PST (the meeting's at 
10:30 AM PST).  Could we put together a call-in number at 9:45 or 10 AM PST 
so you could quickly/briefly brief Steve on the issues prior to the 10:30 AM 
meeting?  Let me know if this works, or if there's a better way to get him up 
to speed on the issues before the meeting.  Thanks very much for helping to 
pull this together on such short notice.

Best,
Jeff
