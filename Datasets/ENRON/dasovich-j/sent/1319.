		 Subject: More information about the SDG&E gas filing

San Diego Gas & Electric Company's filing for emergency relief asked FERC to 
re-impose price caps for short-term releases of capacity for service to the 
California border and to points of interconnection between interstate 
pipelines and California LDCs, and provide that sellers be required to state 
separately the transportation and commodity components of the bundled rate 
for bundled sales at these points, etc.
