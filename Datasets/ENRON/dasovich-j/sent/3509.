Thanks, Steve:  Alan and Jim might want to join in the fun.  Does 1PM west 
coast time work for folks to have a brief kick-off discussion of how we might 
assess the costs of a "California for Californians" energy policy?

Best,
Jeff

Yes, I'll be in Houston this week.  We could discuss there. But might be 
useful to discuss tomorrow when you return.  I'm available.  Seems useful to 
try to get a start on it tomorrow.  You available for a quick call?  My 
schedule's pretty flexible.

Best,
Jeff
