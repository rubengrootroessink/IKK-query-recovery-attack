You're the man.  I got some comments from Christine (sort of).  See most 
recent email.  I emailed it to Aceves, but if more changes come in, I don't 
see any problem telling him to disregard the email and use the hard copy you 
turn in tomorrow.  Thanks a million.  Greatly appreciated.  I owe you one.  
This one was really a hot potato.  First Kim, then me, now you.  

Best,
Jeff
