Wow.  Don't worry about it.  Have a great time in Montana.  It will be 
gorgeous up there.  You're camped out in Roseville?  You don't deserve that, 
Courtney.  Good idea to find out when the deadlines are.  When you get back, 
give a call and we can meet at break or have lunch or a beer after work or 
something.  Considering your options and keeping them open is a great idea 
and the right thing to do.  Don't stress too much.  Good luck and can't wait 
to hear about Big Sky.

Best,
Jeff

Looks unlikely that we'll get to catch up this week. 
I'm attempting to get to Big Sky, Montana for a
fantastic wedding weekend with my family, (Cousin
getting married).  Hopefully leaving on Thursday-we'll
see what my onsite manager says about it tomorrow. I'm
skipping class tomorrow night.
And I am working every day for the next month up in
the Roseville, land o' HP.  I'm staying up here,
commuting to school-which is what's killing me. 
Plus-I have this increasing concern that I'm not
actually absorbing an MBA's worth of learning and
experiences. Alas-I'll tell you all about it when we
talk.  I sent Diane an email to get the deadlines,
etc.   Have a great time in Portland.  1/2 of the
classes?  dangerous!!
