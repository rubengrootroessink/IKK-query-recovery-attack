Thanks so much for the gifts.  Very sweet.  Sorry I was rushed, but I've got 
a big bad finance midterm on Tuesday that I ain't ready for and work's nuts.  
But I really want to hear more about the trip.  Sounds like it was a blast.  

You looked lovely in the pictures, all dressed up a la l'Italienne, and you 
look lovely in your everyday sweatshirt and jeans, too.  (Don't sweat it.)  

Prentice and I were planning on going to the Shea's tonite.  You guys going?

Also, I'd love to talk to you this weekend if possible about Prentice's bday 
festivities.
