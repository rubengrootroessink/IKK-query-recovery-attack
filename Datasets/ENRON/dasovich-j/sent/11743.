we'll likely go to the gym (in Napa) and be back at your place around 7.  
That in time for dinner?

You guys were so great and so much help yesterday that I hardly had a
chance
to nag Eldon at all - oh, that's right - it was Father's Day - wasn't it...

Really thanks a lot!   You certainly helped make it a fun time - but there
wasn't any music!
