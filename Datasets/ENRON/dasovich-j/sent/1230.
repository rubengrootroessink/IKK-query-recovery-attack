Ditto, Christine:  I've proposed some edits (for what they're worth) to 
Christine's fine work.  Kim, this case has left me brain dead ("compare the 
differences between the US Consitutation and the Magna Carta"---give me a 
break), so you may want to make sure that I haven't made any outrageous typos.

Best,
Jeff
