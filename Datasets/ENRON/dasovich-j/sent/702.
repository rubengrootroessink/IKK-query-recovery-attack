Subject:=09Email Glitch
Have just discovered that some emails sent to the board earlier this week d=
id=20
not go through and got hung up in cyberspace.  Most dealt with the emergenc=
y=20
petitions for modification filed by Edison and PG&E and the data request fo=
r=20
financial information which ALJ Minkin issued.  This is the first, which we=
nt=20
out on Monday:
=20
SDG&E has filed an initial response to ALJ Minkin's Ruling which first=20
requests that the utility should not be subject to the information request=
=20
which stemmed from the SCE and PG&E emergency petitions.  If the Commission=
=20
is unwilling to do so, the utility next informs the Commission of its=20
intention not to respond fully to the request.  The crux of the opposition =
is=20
as follows:=20
=20
"However, neither Rule 1 nor the Public Utilities Code require SDG&E to wai=
ve=20
certain fundamental due process rights pertaining to its discovery=20
obligations.  Specifically, simply because the information is requested in =
an=20
ALJ ruling as opposed to alternative discovery mechanisms does not require=
=20
SDG&E to produce confidential, proprietary, competitively sensitive=20
information belonging to its affiliates which information is neither=20
pertinent to a transaction between SDG&E and an affiliate nor in the=20
possession of SDG&E.  A number of the informational demands in the ALJ Ruli=
ng=20
fall squarely within this context and therefore are not appropriate for=20
discovery purposes."
=20
The utility then states that:
=20
"In an effort to cooperate with the Commission and the ALJ to provide for=
=20
Commission inspection relevant information reasonably calculated to lead to=
=20
the discovery of admissible evidence, SDG&E will provide affiliate=20

that=20
the information relates to a transaction with SDG&E (i.e. falls within the=
=20
scope of PUC section 314(b)), the information is public information (not=20
confidential and proprietary to the affiliate), or the information is a=20
matter of public record."
