Jennifer:  I got a call from Chris Bailey (sp?) needing a summary of 
California dereg for a presentation(s) that Harold's assembling.  Attached is 
summary that Mona pulled together for Harold a couple of months ago.  I don't 
have Chris' email address (I've left him a message).  Could you forward this 
along to him?  Thanks a bunch.

Best,
Jeff
