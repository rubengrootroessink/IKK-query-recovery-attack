Title: California in the Dark
URL: http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2302


In a recent Washington Post op-ed piece, Dan Yergin and Larry Makovich

California down the road to an expensive public power setup and higher prices 
for consumers and businesses. And the shortage is going to get worse this 
summer.
