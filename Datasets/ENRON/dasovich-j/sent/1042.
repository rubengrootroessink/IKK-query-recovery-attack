Hey Jeff,
What a surprise -- yesterday I was looking at the latest "Berkeleyan" and 
on page three there you were!  Have you seen the picture?  It is from the 
electricity summit.  It is a picture of you and a guy that looks like Burl 
Ives -- It sort of looks like he is telling you an off color joke.  (It 
also says that you are director of enron corp.!)  Anyway, it was great 
treat to see you in the local rag.  Brightened my day.
