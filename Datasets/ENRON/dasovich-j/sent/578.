Mike:

We'd talked about getting together to discuss the bills for the case.  We'd 
originally agreed to a flat fee of $13, 500 (if memory serves) with a bonus 
for coming in under the cap.  You've sent me bills (as of August 17 according 
to my records) for over $25,000.  As you recall, we had a very lengthy 
discussion regarding the magnitude of the work associated with the hearings 
and associated briefs.  I stressed that $13.5 was what I'd spend and that 
we'd have to do the best we could within that constraint, which is why I 
pressed for a flat fee arrangement at the outset.  With that in mind, I 
believe that it's important to honor the arrangement.  However, in light of 
the particular circumstances in this case, I'm willing to exceed the previous 
arrangement for a total of $15,000, but can't go above that.  If you'd like 
to discuss it further, I'd be happy to talk about it.  Let me know.

Best,
Jeff
