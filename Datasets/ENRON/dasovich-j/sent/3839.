This paraphrased from Tom Briggs, Enron Govt Affairs, DC:

The Bush Administration has indicated that it will not support any sort of 
legislation containing price caps.  Although something could get out of the 
Senate, it won't go anywhere without Administration support.

Thus, by default, the just and reasonable standard becomes the FERC's 
evolving rate-screen process, which, for imports into California, is  "daily 
spot market gas prices and an average 12,000 Btu/kWh heat rate."  The 
standard for in-state resoruces is higher, more like 18,000 Btu/KwH.

Instead, expect to see legislation that will take short-term actions to 
increase supply and decrease demand.  This could include demand buy down 
programs, and laws the force utility financial solvency.

Every day is a new day but I am told this will likely be the status quo until 
the congressional recess is over (recess is from 6-30 April).
