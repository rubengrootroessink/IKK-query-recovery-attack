Harry, I'll be on the call and I'll call you beforehand.  Mike Day has every 
financial incentive for us to have a witness, and I'm still struggling to 
find the value.  As for the "save the planet" crew....I'm as concerned as you 
are.  I'll try to make sure that Kaufman's on (who's a lawyer and is 
considerably more to our thinking than to Mike's, Roger's or Stoness'.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff - regarding the call tomorrow afternoon on witness/issue strategy, hope 
you can be on.  We talked about this today with Mike and Roger.  The single 
issue we may need to cover is DA's access to retained generation (as a proxy 
for the PX calculation issue.)  I am very sympathetic to your arguments about 
minimizing Enron face time before the Commission.  Mike does favor putting on 
witness(es) and Roger, Scott and crew think it's our opportunity to save the 
planet.  We need to have some potential witnesses in mind.  Weisenmuller?  
Any legitimate California academic types who have credibility here and could 
take the high road on this issue?  If you can talk with me prior to the call, 
page me at 888 397-3996.  I will also leave a message with Paul Kaufman to 
encourage his participation on the scheduled conference call.
