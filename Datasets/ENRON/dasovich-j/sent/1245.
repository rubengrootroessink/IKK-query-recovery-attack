Please keep this confidential at this point.  It's the agenda for the 
California "subcommittee" meeting on Tuesday that I mentioned in an earlier 
note.  They were unable to reschedule the meeting, which starts at 10 AM 
tomorrow, but we're on the subcommitte and  will have very good access to the 
final product, so I'm not too concerned about missing the "kickoff" meeting.  
Folks in California are really looking to us to help figure out item #2 
"forward contracting."  It would be very useful to discuss this outline 
tomorrow while we're all together.

Best,
Jeff

Attached is a discussion agenda for tomorrow's CESG meeting at 10:00 at
the Chamber of Commerce.  Our objective for tomorrow is to move through
these and other issues you raise to outline a strawperson proposal for
forward contracting,  rate stabilization and TRA undercollections.  As
Ralph's email of Sunday evening observed,  if we manage to stay narrowly
focused on these issues in the short-run we may have an opportunity to
move the debate.
