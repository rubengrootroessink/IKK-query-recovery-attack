"In addition, we are pursuing sale-and-leaseback negotitations for an 
aggregate of approximately $50 million for ten of our stores.  These sources 
of additional funds, along with internally generated cash flow (what 
internally generated cash flow???), will provide us with an ample financial 
foundation to continue to underwrite our growth over the next several years."
