George:
If you get a minute, could you call to de-brief on the meeting we had the 
Gruma?  Just want to touch base in the event that there's any follow up.  
Hope that it was helpful.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff,
Thanks for your responsiveness....your willingness to adjust your schedule as 
necessary is appreciated.  Here's an update on meeting with Gruma.
I've learned that Gruma's Irwin Gordon is in town only Monday before he 
leaves for Europe, so assuming he still wants to participate, we will try to 
do Monday via conf. call.  Please advise any conflicts you have on Monday.  
Steve Brunner, Gruma's SVP is supposed to let me know asap.

Craig Sutter and I (at least) will be at Gruma's offices Mon. afternoon for a 
previously scheduled meeting.

I will let you know as soon as I learn of Gruma's preferences.
