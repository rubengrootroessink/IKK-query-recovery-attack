I haven't heard  that, but I was running around quite a bit yesterday.  
Governor Backbone has however been recently attempting to appeal to the Nader 
(noisy) wing of the party, so it wouldn't be altogether surprising.  We can 
poke around.

Best,
Jeff

I was mystified by that as well.  I'm not convinced that he was referring to 
AB 1X.  

Jeff or Sandi,

Have you heard the Governor making this reference?

I'm curious about the Gov's statement that he has "eliminated" deregulation.  
Is he referring to the direct access ssupension language in AB 1X?  Can you 
shed some light on this?
