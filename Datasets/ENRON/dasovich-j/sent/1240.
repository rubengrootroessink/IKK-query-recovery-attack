Hi Michelle:

Guess who?  Just went into Ehronline and noticed that under vacation it sez 
that I'm entitled to 75 hours of vacation, and that I've used 48 hours, 
leaving 27.  I think that I'm actually entitled to more than 75 hours.  
Please tell me that I am.  Thanks very much.

Signed,
Desperately in need of vacation

Also, I clicked on deferral enrollment, and by-golly if I couldn't find the 
election form to download.  Am I just clueless, or is there another place 
that I need to look for it?  Thanks a million.
