Rick:

Just want to let you know that I missed the boat a bit in coordinating my 
reviewers with Paul.  In my first attempt to input them in the system, I 
hesitated including you for the simple reason that I'm certain you have 
countless other reviews to do already, and, frankly, I feel that you're an 
integral part of my review whether you're formally on the list or not.  When 
I went back to make my final additions to the list, the systerm was already 
closed--Paul had approved the first round, which I guess shuts it down.  

It's likely not appropriate for reviews to happen outside the system, but I 
wanted to let you know that, from my perspective, it would be great to 
receive from you.  I'd value it a lot.  And I think we've worked closely 
enough together over the last year for you to have a basis for reviewing me.  
But again, I'm of the view that irrespective of the list, you partake in my 
review of necessity, and I don't want to add any additional burdens to an 
already loaded schedule.

No big deal, just wanted to let you know.

And I'm having a field day filling out your review. ("Rick discriminates 
unfairly against neon-colored shirts.")   Seriously, I was quite pleasantly 
surprised to have ended up as one of your reviewers.

Best,
Jeff
