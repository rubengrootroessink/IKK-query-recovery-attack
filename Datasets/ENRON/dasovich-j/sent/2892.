Thanks, Karen.  And please thank Marathon for the info.  If this holds true, 
sounds like Burton plans to make things pretty messy.

FYI, here's info from Marathon about who potentially could carry Angelides' 
proposal.

Karen -
We believe its going to be John Burton.

We've also heard that any of these bond issue proposals are going to run
into trouble with Kathleen Connell.  They all have to go through her office
and she's not prepared to be helpful.  She's viewing it as an issue in her
Los Angeles Mayor's race since bond repayments will be spread over all state
taxpayers and she doesn't think muni customers should have to participate.
This may be moot by April 10 if she doesn't make it into the runoff, but she
can make some noise til then.

Any chance you can find out if Angelides has found someone to carry his
proposal in the Legislature?  Thanks! kd
