My apologies.  I've been meaning to come in, but figured that at some point 
the Telebears on the Web would work.  But no luck.  Here are the courses that 
I'd like to register for.   SID: 84054310G1.

Competitive Strategy (E210): #09250
Corporate Finance (E234):  #09301
Securities Markets (E233):  #09292
Internet Strategy (E262B):  #09373
Pricing (E296-10):   ???
Speaking for Management (E291B-1)---I believe that Diane has already listed 
me for this one.

Please let me know that you've received so that I don't delay anything any 
longer.  And thanks so much for your help.  If there's anything else that you 
need, please don't hestitate to let me know.

Best,
Jeff
