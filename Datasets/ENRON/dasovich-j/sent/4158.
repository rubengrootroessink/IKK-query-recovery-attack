Here's the original note that I sent about the bill (yours and ms cameron's) 
that ended up on my bill.

Hi.  I've got all the paperwork.  The bill (on my bill) for you guys is
$740.  I'll get you the paperwork tonite.  Sorry for the mix-up  (should I
ask Squaw for a discount due to all the mess!?!?).
