As of yet, I have not yet received your completed lobbying questionnaire.  If 
it is in the mail, please disregard this message.  If it is not in the mail, 
please fill out the questionnaire as soon as possible and return to me via 
email or interoffice mail so that we can be in compliance with Federal income 
tax laws.  If you did not engage in lobbying activity in 2000, a short email 
to that effect is sufficient.  Many thanks for your cooperation.
