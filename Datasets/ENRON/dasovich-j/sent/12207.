Greetings Ms Dotty.  Hope you've managed to stay a night or two in your house 
recently.  Do you think that it would be OK to call your cousin in Sea 
Ranch?  I have some carpentry work I'd like done on my property (panel 
interior of cabin; build deck and gazebo) and thought I might get him, or 
someone who works for/with him, or someone he could recommend to help me 
out.  If you think he wouldn't mind having me call, might you have his phone 
number (and full name)?  As always, greatly appreciated.

FYI:  Just talked to the guy from UC Davis who's in the field for Mendocino 
County.  He says that by the sound of it, my property just might end up being 
vine-friendly!

All the best,
Jeff
