Would you mind putting it down on paper so I can give it to Lay?  Just two or 
so bullets of the El Paso accusation and then some bullets on the more 
fundamental story.

You got it.  Just give me a call and we'll walk through "the other side of 
the story."

Best,
Jeff

Can I talk you or someone else who is close to this into a one pager on why  
a simple supply/demand explanation of California border prices trumps 
Carpenter's El Paso dun it conspiracy analysis?

I don't want Lay to be stumped by a question on this at his Wednesday IAEE 
talk.

Attached is Paul Carpenter (Brattle Group) preliminary findings that 
marketers have market power at the border.

By my second email I'm sending Enron's responses to the pleadings at FERC 
which refute the notion of the need to reinstitute price controls at the 
California border.

Alternatively, a good argument to high gas prices at the CA border is the 
message in Stan's natural gas roundtable speech (i.e. high gas prices can be 
directly attributed to supply/demand factors).

FYI.  Presentation by Brattle Group before CA leg committee yesterday in 
which they assert market power at the CA border (held by "out-of-state 
suppliers") explains high gas prices in California.  If you have any 
questions, call me at 415.782.7822.  Please forward to others whom you think 
might be interested.  Stephanie, could you forward along to Barry?

Best,
Jeff
