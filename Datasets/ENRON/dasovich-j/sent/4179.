Shoot.  Remember that I asked many moons ago if you wanted the tickets?  I 
thought you said no.  So I let it go.  Now they've all been snatched up.  But 
I'll see if if those folks are still planning on going.  I think that chances 
are extremely slim, though.  I'll let you know.  Sorry.

Best,
Jeff

any chance of getting tickets for any of the Cubs games - 4/27, 4/28, 4/29?
I have 2 each for the 27th and 28th - but I know Eldon would like to go with
more than one person.  I have 4 for Sunday - and I think Cameron and Scott
and Eldon and I are going to that one - but it would be fun to have more
attendees.  He especially wanted Rory and Timmi etc. to come on Saturday I
think - anyway just a thought...
