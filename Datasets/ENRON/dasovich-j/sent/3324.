Hey folks.  Mr. Jackson makes some very good points, which I'd like to 
include.  However, before I work them in, wanns make sure that everyone 
agrees with his comments, since including some of his will require some 
modifications to the direction that the memo takes.  We could discuss in a 
brief conference call if folks wish.  Also, please review what I've done--not 
major edits, but edits (with some questions and additions) nonetheless.

Best,
Jeff
