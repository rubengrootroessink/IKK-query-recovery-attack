Hi.  Thanks for the note.  Couple of things.  Prentice is going to do Xmas 
with us this year cuz her family will be out of town.  So we should 
absolutely include her, but I think she really wants to be included in the 
"picking" so that she gets someone's name.  If you'd like to pick the names 
and let people know, I'm completely comfortable with that.  (Confidentially, 
I have a great idea for Mike, so if, by chance, I get him as a pick, that 
would be great!)

Also, let me throw this out.  You know that if I didn't live in a 1-bedroom 
apartment, I'd host (and hopefully, we'll be having Xmas at my place in 
Mendocino a few years down the road).  Steve and Charry really carry the load 
all the time.  Have you considered opening presents and having dinner at your 
place?  I'd be happy to take care of the meal, and hang around to clean up 
afterwards.  No big deal, just a thought.  Alternatively, we could absolutely 
have it at Prentice's apartment, which is plenty big enough, and will have a 
big beautiful tree, etc.  So give that a thought.  Might be nice to do it in 
the city, and we'd be happy to host it there, too.

Now, the important stuff.  What do Katie and Michael want/need for Xmas?

Best,
Jeff

Jeff,

Great to see you and Prentice on T-day.  The stuffing was delicious!  And 
congratulations on giving up smoking.

It's time to pick names for gifts.  My thought is that Prentice is enough a 
part of this family that we add her name to the group.  Plan B is that we do 
what we did last year:  Mom and I just get something for her and she doesn't 
have to worry about getting something for whoever's name she "picks". Let me 
know.

Debbie
