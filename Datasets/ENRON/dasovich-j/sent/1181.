What's football withdrawal? =20

Howzabout we invite the pool to the napa golf course (everyone pays their o=
wn=20
way) and have a scramble, or something?  It would be a lot of fun and it=20
would give Scott and Cameron another thing to win and gloat over (that's=20
right Eldon, they're gloaters---shame on them).
