Mark:
Here's the info

Size = 500 MW
Purchase price = $42 MM (sold to Calpine)
Permit  status at time of sale = all permits had been obtained

One note:  while we had gas and electric interconnection agreements ready to 
execute, Calpine told us not to and they arranged those for themselves.

If there's anything else that you need don't hesitate.

Happy holidays.

Best,
Jeff
