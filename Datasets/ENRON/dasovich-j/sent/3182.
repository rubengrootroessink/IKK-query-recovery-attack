Don't even worry about it.  Thanks for being sensitive to the issue. Good to 
see you guys this weekend, despite all the excitement.

Best,
Jeff

I didn't get this e-mail until today  (I mean I hadn't downloaded anything
for a couple of days and therefore didn't even know it was there).  If I had
seen it, I wouldn't have made the comments I made at the dome about wanting
to hear what you had to say about the very things you specified in your
e-mail you didn't want to hear.  You must have thought I was deliberately
going against your wishes and I apologize for that.  If you remember, the
last time we had talked about the problem re energy, you were not reluctant
to discuss it so I thought something had happened at the dome that needed to
be straightened out.  So, as I stated above, if I had seen your e-mail
before going to the dome, I would have understood what was going on.

hi.  how's things.  my cars getting fixed as we speak!  it'll be ready next
tues/wed.  I'm very excited about going to the dome this weekend and
looking forward to seeing you guys.  can you please bring annie with you?

one small request:  i'm pretty frazzled with work, school, etc. and am
looking forward to relaxing and hanging out with you guys.  it would be
great to talk about anything other than 1) the electricity crisis and 2)
george w. bush.  i figure we can talk for hours about how to get the
railing done on the deck!

best,
jeff
