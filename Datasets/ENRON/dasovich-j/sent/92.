Energy Commission Committee Recommends Moss Landing Licensing 
A California Energy Commission Siting Committee has recommended that Duke 
Energy's proposed 1,060 MW Moss Landing Power Project located in Monterey 
County should be given full Commission approval. 

The Moss Landing Siting Committee recommends the plant be approved for 
construction and operation at the existing Moss Landing Power Plant site that 
was previously operated by PG&E for approximately 50 years. According to the 
Committee, the Moss Landing project is entitled to certification not only 
under local ordinances and regulations but under the Warren-Alquist Act and 
the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), based upon evidence 
presented at formal public hearings. 

The Committee has specified that Duke Energy will pay $7 million to support 
steps that mitigate the impacts of the power plant's operations on the area's 
marine biology. The $500 million Moss Landing Power Plant Project is a 
natural gas-fired combined cycle power plant to be located near the Moss 
Landing Harbor. The Commission began its review of the project in August 
1999. 

The proposed project is scheduled to be on-line by summer of 2002. If 
approved, the project will increase the total generating capacity of the Moss 
Landing plant to approximately 2,590 MW.
