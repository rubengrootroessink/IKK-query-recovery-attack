As we discussed, attached is a brief description of ENA's and EES' key goals 
in California and the actions underway to achieve them.  We'll update the 
status report weekly.  We hope that the weekly update will serve as a useful 
internal communication tool to keep folks abreast of activities and 
developments in CA.  It can also serve as a tool to help identify the need to 
modify our goals and/or actions as circumstances change.   

Comments on the form and/or substance of the document and how we can make it 
more useful are welcome.

Best,
Jeff
