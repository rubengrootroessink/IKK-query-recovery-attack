Our plan worked.  By telling you two you better hurry cuz otherwise we'd go 
ahead, you guys jumped first.  Thanks.  Now all the pressure's off.  

Yes, we'll be there on Sunday.  

I think the only person who doesn't know is Cameron....

Best,
Jeff

Thanks, dude, that's really nice. I have no idea what I'm doing at all--just 
going with my heart. I struggled between telling people and not, but just 
figured I had to tell some. Will you be there Sunday so that I can just 
drink and play pool and ease into this? I hope so. And don't forget, you're 
next son!

Hope post-school is treating you right.

LATE!
