I think that is a great idea.  It would be great.  Fun mix of people too.
Where should we have it???  I think it should not be at our house in Napa,
but someplace a little more special.

P.S.  Nice use of "birthday" as the segue to the deal.

Speaking of birthdays, Prentice has informed me that, despite my
protestations (being a very low-key sort of guy), there "must" be some
party for my birthday this year (which I'm still opposed to--and I may be
in Houston that MONTH anyway).

I was thinking (cuz I hate spotlights), that it might be fun and
interesting, since your Dad and I are both hitting interesting birthdays
this year, if we had a joint party---double the people, double the fun.  (I
don't know if he'd rather have a solo party for his, though.)  And since my
dad's met your dad, but our mom's ain't been in the mix,  I though it might
be a good (and hopefully safe) atmosphere to get them together in.

Am I smoking crack on the whole idea?

Sorry for surprising you this morning!!  Nothing wrong with being
comfortable in your birthday suit.

Speaking of birthdays, I think we should have a goal to get my company
acquired by your company by May 30, 2001.  Good goal, huh??

I want to talk to you about the details I have been thinking about while
you
were gone.  When should we talk??  Let's set up a meeting so we make sure
to
move this all forward.

Welcome back.
