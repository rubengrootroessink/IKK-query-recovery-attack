Hello My Favorite Problem Child!! (Just kidding!)

You truly only have 27 hrs remaining.  What is confusing is the "entitlement" 
piece.  What that means that as of 7/1/00 you had 75 hrs remaining when we 
moved to SAP.  You begain the year with 126 hrs, took 51 hrs prior to 7/1/00 
leaving you 75 hrs.  After 7/1/00 you took 48 hrs leaving you with 27 hrs as 
your balance.  Hope this helps!

Mary - can you help Jeff with his deferral enrollment?  He apparently does 
not have that piece on his eHRonline.  He is way out in San Francisco and a 
really nice guy - can you help him please???

Regards,
Michelle

Hi Michelle:

Guess who?  Just went into Ehronline and noticed that under vacation it sez 
that I'm entitled to 75 hours of vacation, and that I've used 48 hours, 
leaving 27.  I think that I'm actually entitled to more than 75 hours.  
Please tell me that I am.  Thanks very much.

Signed,
Desperately in need of vacation

Also, I clicked on deferral enrollment, and by-golly if I couldn't find the 
election form to download.  Am I just clueless, or is there another place 
that I need to look for it?  Thanks a million.
