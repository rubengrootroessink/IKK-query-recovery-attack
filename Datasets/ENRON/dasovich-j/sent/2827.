FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
January 3, 2001

  GOVERNOR DAVIS CALLS SPECIAL
LEGISLATIVE SESSION ON ENERGY

SACRAMENTO - Governor Gray Davis today issued a proclamation requiring the
legislature to convene a special session to pass legislation addressing
California's energy crisis.

According to the guidelines of the proclamation, the session will focus on
legislation that:

Affects the availability, consumption, and use of energy;
Governs the finances and organization of the California Independent System
Operator (ISO) and the California Power Exchange (PX);
Addresses the operation, maintenance, and finances of California power
generators and utilities;
Affects the wholesale and retail markets for energy supplies, capacity, and
reliability; and
Protects the health and safety of Californians with respect to
power-generating facilities and transmission facilities.
"In response to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) failure to
meet its obligations, I am taking the extraordinary step of calling the
California Legislature into a concurrent Extraordinary Session to
immediately address the energy situation in our state," said Governor Davis.
"I will call them to do at least the following: Replace the so-called
stakeholders on the ISO Board with Californians who are more concerned about
affordable prices and reliability of power and; re-establish the authority
for the state to inspect private power plants to assure the coordination of
maintenance and operating schedules; and provide low-interest financing for
new peaking facilities or re-powering old ones to make them cleaner and more
efficient in return for committing their power to Californians at guaranteed
low rates."

Governor Davis used his constitutional power to call for the special session
(Section 3(b) Article IV). The session will begin on January 3, 2001. Each
house of the legislature will be responsible for the scheduling of hearings
and the calendar for the session.

Governor Davis called a special session on education in 1999, and the
legislature passed a series of sweeping initiatives to improve academic
performance and accountability.
