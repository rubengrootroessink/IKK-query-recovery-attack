I apologize, but I won't be in SF Monday evening, and this week coming up 
will be a grinder.  I have a lot of time to work on it over the weekend, 
though. I can provide a fax number tomorrow where the materials can be sent 
to me.  And I assume that they are on the Izio site, too.  I'm going to go 
there now.  Tomorrow, I'll try to crunch some numbers and outline the 
one-pager and distribute to folks by the end of the day.  Then perhaps we can 
email each other on Monday and try to make some progress on the memo by the 
end of the day.  That should put us in pretty good shape to finish it up 
Tuesday and Wednesday.  If I can't get the materials off of Izio, I'll let 
you know.  I'll report back in the AM tomorrow with a proposed game plan, 
once I've collected all the materials and pondered things a bit.  Sound 
reasonable? Thoughts?  Just let me know.

Mark, I hope that if you're in Denver, that means you're skiing.

Best,
Jeff

Can we schedule a conference call at 8pm on Monday night?  I'm returning from
Denver that evening and assuming all goes according to schedule I should be 
home
by then.  

Jeff- we'll need your conference call making capabilities.  You up for it?
