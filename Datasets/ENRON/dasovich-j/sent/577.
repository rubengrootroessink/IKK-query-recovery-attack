Harry:  FYI.  First meeting to discuss how to dole out the $50 MM created by 
AB 970 is 10.7.  Someone I've worked with on DG-type deals in the past from 
EES is going to attend the meeting (Brian Smith from the Costa Mesa office).  
Bob Frank and I had a conference call with him this morning.  URL for the 
event is included below.

Best,
Jeff

I am pulling together an answer to Larry Derrett's question concerning tax 
credits/deductions to incent companies to invest in DSM.  Am aware of recent 
California SB 970 that makes available $50 million to implement 
cost-effective energy conservation and demand-side management programs.  And 
of course there are lots of utility-specific programs that have been in place 
for a while.

Question - are you aware of any new initiatives, federal, state, or 
otherwise, that are being proposed?  Are you engaged anywhere in proposing 
such things?  Thank you.

Rick,
Could you give Larry Derrett a brief update on his question.  
Since many people in EES are asking a similar question, I'll copy Peggy 
Mahoney and ask her to use your answer as the source for communicating this 
to our employees via the BUZZ, our weekly newsletter. 
Thanks

Given the current political climate and concerns about adequacy of energy 
supplies, is someone at EES lobbying with politicians for certain 
arrangements which could be beneficial to our business?  For example, would 
there be interest in creating a tax credit/favorable deduction to incent 
companies to invest in DSM assets to reduce energy consumption?  I can't 
imagine that the political climate could be any better than now for a program 
like this.
