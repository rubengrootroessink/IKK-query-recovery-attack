Greetings:
Have you seen this?  Any view on whether there's a group of economists who 
think otherwise and might be willing to express their views in a response to 
this letter?

P.S. Talked to Tyson re: trying to get economists back in the middle of this, 
but I wasn't altogether successful.

Best,
Jeff
