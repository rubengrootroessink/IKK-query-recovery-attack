Thanks.  Didn't get it the first time.  Good comments.  I'm actually in 
Vancouver today (Monday) and tomorrow.  Let's keep sending back and forth and 
get together Wednesday morning to finalize.  I'll get a hold of Calger for 
his comments.    You can leave messages on my voicemail, too.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff,

I don't know if my e:mail from home got to you so I am applying the fail-safe 
method.  Discard if you already got it.

Thanks,

Laird

Jeff,
?
I will not be in the office tomorrow - off to  Sacramento to see NCPA - but I 
wanted to provide my comments regarding the  Sempra presentation.? First of 
all, you did a great job.??I don't  know about "Partnership Solutions"; 
however, I can't think of a better  description of what we want so, let's 
make it work.
?
Here are my comments:
?
1.? On the page, "Partnership Goals", under  2nd bullet.
?
??? Change "Enhance earnings" to  "Enhance earnings; Expand P/E Multiple"
?
2.? On the page, "Energy Solutions", remove  both 25 MW quotes.? They don't 
have much meaning to Sempra; therefore, I  suggest we go with the two 500 MW 
quotes only.
?
3.? On the page, "Energy Solutions", under the  2nd bullet.
?
??? Change "Sempra gets better...."  to 
?
??? "Enhanced access to  markets"
??? "Open, liquid and  competitive"
??? "Defensible to oversight  entities"
?
4.? On the page, "Benefits of Online  Independent Auction", the 3rd and 4th 
bullets?are not?benefits of the  auction.? They are benefits of?a fixed price 
product. Do we need a  bullet to suggest that Sempra needs a portfolio 
approach which includes some  fixed priced products?
?
5.? On the page, "Enron Can Help", under the  4th bullet, change Lot 
formulation to Product Specifications.? After  Pre-Qualification:? 
Experience,?Capability, Credit-worthiness,  Reliability
?
6.? On the page, "Gas Solution, Procurement  Outsourcing 1", under the 1st 
bullet, indicate multi-year instead of 10  year.
?
7.? On the page, "Gas Solution, Procurement  Outsourcing 2", in the 2nd 
bullet, pluralize service to services.
?
8.? On the page, "Benefits of Procurement  Outsourcing", under the 1st bullet 
in the 3rd point (responsive to financial  community) - Add to the existing 
statement, Reduce?regulatory risk tied to  procurement, "Enhance Earnings, 
Expand P/E Multiple".
?
Thanks for your efforts in developing this.?  I'll be in late Monday and 
Tuesday morning.
?
Laird
