There's a place for working and re-working.  There's also a a very important 
place in art--writing in particular--for spontaneity and whim.  I'd do a 
tweak here and a snip there, but quickly and only around the edges, and 
submit it as a film review.  It's novel, it's fun, and exposure'd a good 
thing.

Things are good.  Going to be weary for the next 3-4 weeks until schools out, 
though.

Best,
Jeff

Thanks for your suggestions. It's good to know, not only for this, but for 
the future as well. I don't know what the hell Cameron wants to do. She 
thinks that she is some kind of expert editor, when really she is a goddamn 
lawyer who has read a book or two! She does want it to be the best it can 
be, but it is ultimately not that important! Oh well. I'm just going to go 
ahead and do what I want with it anyway.

Hope all's well.
