Subject: Appeal Rights

Mike Day, 

I have asked my assistant to set up a conference call for this evening to 
discuss preserving our argments and rights of appeal, both generally and 
specifically (with respect to the negative CTC issue),  during and after the 
present hearing.  I know that we covered some of this in our previous call, 
and that a record on due process is being made, but I'd like for all of us to 
explore whether there is anything else we should be doing now, and what, if 
anything, we will need to do after the proceeding is concluded.  I will see 
if Larry Mollman from Brobeck can join us as well for the state court 
litigation perspective.  Stephanie will circulate the call-in information.  
Thanks.
