Dude:
No problem.  Sean paid me for his and Molly's dinner and Eldon and Nancy will 
pay me for theirs.  No problem on the toast--I'm sure the favor will be 
repaid many times over.  Rite Spot is always great.  I actually got to bed by 
11:30, so I was OK yesterday.

Best,
Jeff

Dude,

Thanks for everything last night. I know Cameron had a great time. Do you 
want me to help you collect funds for dinner? Also, thanks especially for 
reminding me to give a toast; I had totally spaced! That was fun at Rite 
Spot, too.

I hope today is not too painful.

Scott
