As always, can't thank you enough.  I get the sense that Loretta's decision 
will have to get somewhat friendlier to business (and our poor economy). 

Best,
Jeff

Apparently it didn't go very well.  Burton said he didn't have to deal with 
Reps. cause he
controls a 2/3 vote in his house.  Brulte called Rep leadership together in 
his office last
night to discuss their next move.  This is just the beginning of the dance, 
however.  I'll
let you know.

Also, Zaremberg said he got a call from a reporter who told him the PUC 
decision today would
be friendlier to business.  You probably know that and more, but I'm passing 
it on.
Zaremberg is also going to work on Burton and his blind faith in consumer 
strategies.
