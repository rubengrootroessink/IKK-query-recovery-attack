Steve:
I think I already forward these to you, but if not, they're the prices that 
Henderson came up with for fully shaped prices to the utilities.  May be 
useful re: conversations with the Street about getting the utilities out of 
procurement.  Note that the date on the prices is 10.02.00 so they're 
somewhat stale, but arguably still indicative.  I'm also going to give you 
the prices Belden just gave us (prior to the run up yesterday, though) for 
prices at SP15.

Best,
Jeff
