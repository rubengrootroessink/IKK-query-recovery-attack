Yes, it's technically true, but it doesn't seem relevant.  It's a 
technicality.  That is, if at the end of the contract, UC/CSU goes to another 
provider, the rules would require Enron to "de-DASR," after which the new 
provider would submit the new DASR to switch the customer over.  The utility 
stands in the middle of all this.  I don't think this equates to what UC/CSU 
is claiming the problem is.  Might be viewed as a bit "cute" by the judge.

Also, the legislation "fixing" the prohibition passed our of policy committee 
today in Sacramento and is moving through the Legislature.

Best,
Jeff

Please review and let me know if you have any comments, esp. para. 12.  This
