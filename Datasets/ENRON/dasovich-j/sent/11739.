Let's discuss further, but I believe that the tariff would be a "generic" one 
for network service, with the price, terms and conditions dependent upon the 
size and other attributes of the customer.  Not aware of any negotiated rates 
available from the US/Mex border to the burner tip in S.D.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff,

We've obtained a tariff filing that Sempra made with the CRE in Mexico to 
determine the transportation rates charged by Sempra International to 
transport gas in Mexico.  Can you help us determine the transport rate 
charged to move gas from the California border to the Mexican border through 
Socal and SDG&E?  I understand that SDG&E may be able to negotiate a rate 
that includes the fee paid to Socal?  Is that correct?

What I'm trying to determine is what will be the rate for us to obtain a 
backhaul from a new LNG regas terminal in Mexico, through the Sempra 
International pipeline in Mexico and through SDG&E, to an end user behind 
Socal?  Do you know how this works or do you have a suggestion on how we can 
determine the max rates, plus determine what "actual" rates have been 
negotiated?  We have discussions with Sempra this friday and want to table 
the issue of firm backhauls.

Thanks

Kurt
