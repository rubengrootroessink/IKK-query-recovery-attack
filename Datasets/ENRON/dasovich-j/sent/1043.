Eldon:  If you're willing to get the stuff necessary to make this menu, I'm 
willing to act as "sous-chef" to Cameron to help make it.  Just don' t seem 
right to have Nancy cook on her birthday.

This sounds like a very delicious recipe to make for Saturday - relatively 
easy too and uses our beautiful sage.  It was in my e-mail this morning.

Neapolitan Pork Roast with Potatoes 
6 - 8 cloves garlic, finely chopped 
2 Tbs (30 ml) chopped fresh sage leaves or 2 tsp (10 ml) dried sage 
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste 
1 boneless pork loin roast, 2 to 3 pounds (1 to 1.5 Kg) 
2 lbs (1 Kg) potatoes, cut into 1-inch (3 cm) cubes 
2 Tbs (30 ml) olive oil 
Combine the garlic, sage, salt and pepper in a small bowl.  Make holes 
in the pork roast with a small paring knife and stuff the garlic 
mixture in the holes with your finger, reserving about 1 teaspoon (5 
ml) of the garlic mixture.  Rub any remaining garlic mixture on the 
outside of the roast.  Toss the potatoes with the reserved garlic 
mixture and the olive oil.  Place the roast and the potatoes in a 
roasting pan and place in a preheated 425F (220C) oven.  Remove from 
the oven and stir the potatoes after 30 minutes.  Baste the roast with 
the pan juices and return to the oven.  Lower the heat to 325F (160C) 
and continue to cook, stirring the potatoes and basting the roast 
about every 15 minutes.  Begin checking the internal temperature of 
the roast after about 1 1/4 hours total cooking time.  Remove the 
roast when the internal temperature is 140F (65C) for meat that is 
still slightly pink.  Let the roast rest for 15 minutes before carving.  
Return the potatoes to the oven if they are not crisp and golden. Serves 6 to 
8.
