This should help Prentice's chances for employment come the Fall.  You guys 
should have a HUGE phone bill on your room charges.  Please fax me a copy of 
the bill.  I will cover all phone charges.  Also, please forward to me what I 
owe you for the plane flight and golf and our share of dinners, drinks, 
guacamole, etc.

We played spades at the airport.  My team lost..........again.  My losing 
streak now ties DiMaggio's hitting streak.

Best,
Jeff

#7 RANKING FOR HAAS SCHOOL IS BEST EVER IN LATEST US NEWS BUSINESS SCHOOL 
SURVEY 
The Haas School of Business was ranked the 7th best business school in the 
United States in the latest annual survey of American graduate schools by US 
News and World Report magazine.  This is the best showing ever by the school 
in the history of the US News ranking, which was released Friday. 

US News also ranked the Haas School's Evening MBA Program the 8th best in the 
country, unchanged from last year.  The full-time MBA Program was number 10 
in last year's ranking, up from 14th place the year before.

The rankings appear in the April 9 issue; copies are available on newsstands 
today. The rankings and related stories are also available on line at 
http://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/beyond/bchome.htm.

"We are always pleased when a ranking reflects the reality we live every day, 
which is that the Haas School is a world-class institution, with faculty and 
students who are extraordinarily innovative and accomplished and, 
consequently, very much in demand by every type of major business and 
academic organization, everywhere on earth," said Jay Stowsky, associate dean 
for school affairs and initiatives. 

Several specialty programs at Haas were also ranked among the top 10 
nationwide in a part of the US News survey that is based on the opinions of 
deans and MBA Program heads. They include: finance (10th); general management 
(8th); entrepreneurship (10th); marketing (8th); quantitative analysis (8th); 
and nonprofit organizations (7th).

In addition, the Haas School's graduate program in health management was 
ranked the 7th best program in the country.

The full-time MBA program ranking is based on a weighted average of eight 
measures of academic quality that fall into three major categories: 
reputation (40 percent); placement success (35 percent); and student 
selectivity (25 percent).

CLASSES START TODAY FOR NEW MASTER'S IN FINANCIAL ENGINEERING DEGREE AT HAAS 
For 49 students classes start today for the Master's in Financial Engineering 
(MFE), a new graduate degree program at the Haas School of Business. Of the 
49 students, 6 are taking the program to earn a concurrent degree with the 
MBA program, combining the in-depth study of financial economics and the 
dynamics of markets with the general management education of the MBA program. 
  
The class of 2002 is represented by an international group of highly educated 
scientists and professionals: 
The inaugural class represents 19 countries: 7 students come from China, 6 
come from Canada, 5 from Korea, and 5 come from five different European 
countries. Also represented are South America (Chile and Colombia), Africa 
(Zimbabwe), and Southeast Asia (India and Indonesia), as well as Taiwan, Hong 
Kong, Russia, and the Republic of Georgia. 
Top professions include finance (25%), engineering (18%), and research & 
development (11%) 
18% hold a Ph.D. and 25% hold a master's degree in another field. 
One fourth of the class performed in the top percentile of the GMAT. 
The Haas MFE is the first such degree program in the United States that is 
offered entirely under the auspices of a business school. It is also the 
first US program to require its students to take a three-month internship at 
a top financial firm as part of the learning experience. The Haas MFE program 
will prepare candidates with superior analytical skills for a growing niche 
of quantitative finance careers.

MFE candidates will train for positions as risk managers, investment bankers, 
asset managers, derivatives traders, and developers of specialized securities 
at the world's leading commercial and investment banks, insurance companies, 
and corporate and public treasury departments. 

Founding sponsors include some of the world's top financial firms, namely AIG 
Inc., Barclays Global Investors, BARRA Inc., Gifford Fong Associates, Goldman 
Sachs & Co., First Union Bank, KMV LLC, MBIA Inc., Morgan Stanley Dean 
Witter, Quantal International Inc., The Dean Witter Foundation, and WR 
Hambrecht + Co., LLC. Sponsoring firms will be accepting interns from the 
programs. 

"We're seeing tremendous interest among talented individuals coming from 
technical backgrounds, such as engineers, mathematicians, and scientists, who 
are in narrow jobs and are keen to transition to a brand new career where 
opportunities are abundant and continue to grow," says MFE Executive Director 
John O'Brien.

SHARING OUR STRENGTHS: THE HAAS/BOALT CONNECTION

This is the first in a continuing series of articles in Haas NewsWire 
chronicling the Haas School's interdisciplinary activities. 
The Haas School has traditionally pursued interdisciplinary partnerships on 
the Berkeley campus. During her tenure as dean, Laura Tyson has made it her 
priority to increase Haas' partnerships in the areas of teaching, research, 
and public service with other disciplines. One of the most vibrant of these 
is with the Boalt School of Law. 

"Haas faculty are well known for their path-breaking work on competitive 
strategy in the Internet age, and Boalt is recognized for having the 
strongest intellectual property law faculty in the country, particularly as 
regards IP questions arising in cyberspace," said Jay Stowsky, associate dean 
for school affairs and initiatives. "The collection, in one place, at the 
same time, of so many notable scholars in an area of rich intellectual 
ferment and intense public interest is an extraordinary intellectual 
opportunity.  We intend to expand that opportunity through increased 
interaction between the two schools."

The area of business law doesn't fit easily into just a law school or a 
business school, but the interdisciplinary approach between the Haas School 
of Business and Boalt Hall School of Law fills this gap. From creating joint 
courses to hosting conferences, Haas and Boalt are shaping a dynamic 
partnership that will serve both schools in the future. 

This partnership isn't new. Since 1968, Haas and Boalt have offered a joint 
JD/MBA degree to more than 138 UC Berkeley students (Haas also offers a 
JD/MBA with Hastings). In addition to the joint degree program, Haas and 
Boalt students are sharing classrooms when the topic calls for it. 

Adjunct Professor Leo Helzel and Lecturer Noel Nellis have offered "Top Down 
Law" for six years to law and business students.  Helzel describes the course 
as, "what a CEO needs to know to stay in business."  The class brings in 
practicing lawyers and business people to lecture on their specialties. 
"Business students should be exposed to the broader legal framework in which 
companies operate," says Helzel. Helzel and Nellis have also organized two 
debates on the Microsoft antitrust case, bringing experts from both Haas and 
Boalt to take sides on the issue.

The Business and Public Policy group offered one course, "Law and Strategy of 
E-Commerce," in fall 2000 with Boalt. Pablo Spiller, the Joe Shoong Professor 
of International Business and Public Policy and the chair of the Business and 
Public Policy Group, taught the course along with Robert P. Merges, the 
Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati Distinguished Professor of Law and 
Technology and a director of the Berkeley Center for Law & Technology.  In 
the fall 2001, Rui de Figueiredo, assistant professor in the Business and 
Public Policy Group, will teach "Deals" with Howard Shelanski, acting 
professor of law, to both business and law students.  

The Management of Technology (MOT) Program is sponsoring two evening 
conferences at Haas this spring organized with Peter Menell, professor of 
law. The first on "Television-Internet Convergence" took place on March 14 in 
Arthur Andersen Auditorium. On April 18 the second annual Boalt Hall/MOT 
Conference on Digital Music takes place in the Arthur Andersen Auditorium 
beginning at 4:00 pm. 

"Partnering with Boalt just makes so much sense when we're exploring issues 
of technology, business, and intellectual property," says Andrew Isaacs, the 
executive director of MOT. "The connections are there. Having BoaIt literally 
next door is a fantastic resource." 

An academic conference, "Beyond Microsoft: Antitrust, Technology, and 
Intellectual Property" organized by Mark Lemley, professor of law and a 
director of the Berkeley Center for Law & Technology, took place at Haas and 
Boalt on March 2 and 3.  Sponsored by the Institute of Management, 
Innovation, and Organization (IMIO) and the Institute of Business and 
Economics Research (IBER), the conference included a presentation by Carl 
Shapiro, the Transamerica Professor of Business Strategy and the director of 
IBER, and participation by Dean Tyson and Professor Michael Katz. 

All of this hard work builds the base for long-term future collaborations, 
says Stowsky, "In addition to enhancing the traditional training of both 
managers and lawyers in the intricacies of business law, the increased 
collaboration positions UC Berkeley to become the leading center of academic 
research and policy analysis related to the economic, legal, social, and 
political impacts of the Internet." 
HAAS ADVISORY BOARD CONVENES FOR SEMI-ANNUAL MEETING 
This Friday, Haas will host a group of high-level CEOs, presidents, chairs, 
and company founders as the members of the Haas Advisory Board gather for 
their semi-annual meeting. The 60 plus member board, which includes 
representatives from major companies in almost every field of business, 
brings knowledge of best business practices to the Haas planning process. The 
current chairman, Roger Siboni, BS 76, is president and CEO of E.piphany. 

Since December 2000 Dean Laura Tyson has recruited five new members to the 
Advisory Board: 
Margo Alexander, BS 68, chairman & CEO of Mitchell Hutchins Asset Management, 
the asset management subsidiary of PaineWebber Incorporated.  She is also a 
member of the Board of Directors for PaineWebber Incorporated.  
Kim Fisher, MBA 94, co-founder and CEO of AudioBasket.com, a service for 
personalized, broadcast-quality audio programming through web sites and 
wireless service providers.  Prior to AudioBasket, Fisher worked for Motorola 
Network Ventures, a division of Motorola that invests in international 
wireless, paging, and Internet service providers. 
Arun Sarin, MBA 79, is the former chief executive officer of InfoSpace, Inc., 
the leading global Internet infrastructure company.  He joined InfoSpace in 
May 2000 from Vodafone AirTouch, where he served as CEO of the US and Asia 
Pacific regions. 
Trevor Traina, MBA 96, is an entrepreneur and private investor.  Most 
recently he was a group manager in Microsoft's MSN Internet division.  
Previously, he was the president and founder of Compare.Net, the leading 
buyer's guide on the Internet.  
John Williford, MBA 80, is the president and chief executive officer of Menlo 
Logistics and a senior vice president for CNF Transportation Inc. Williford 
is also responsible for managing CNF's operations in support of its contract 
to sort and move Priority Mail for the U.S. Postal Service. 
On the agenda: faculty research, possibilities for new degree programs, and 
the upcoming Tokyo Symposium.
