Wow.  Have a great trip.  I'll anxiously await your return.

Best,
Jeff

Yes - it truly was wonderful to see you.  Swan's it is.  Soon.  I have a too
hectic March and then will be in Europe for two weeks in April so it will be
late April or May before I see you again.  My 50th BD treat to myself is to
take Malcolm to London and Greenwich and Portsmouth and Paris and see all
the Napoleanic Wars sites.  Especially Nelson's ship the Victory which is in
Portsmouth.  (Mike and Kate are coming along, but I think they will probably
squeeze in a trip to Ireland to see horses...)

Anyway - realistically, it'll be farther along into spring.

Until then,  G.
