Seem like it's up to Cameron.  In the past, she's said that she doesn't like 
her B-Day to be included in the weekends' festivities.  I'm happy to 
celebrate then, though?  And happy to do anything else that anyone wants to 
do to celebrate.

Signed,
Ooooolllll' Easy Goin'

what's the plan for Ms. Cameron's birthday?  Should I bring her presents up
to the dome and we celebrate there or are you guys planning anything on the
real day or would you want to come to Napa??
