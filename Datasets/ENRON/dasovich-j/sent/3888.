Please review the press release one last time.  This draft includes changes I 
previously received from Rex, Drew, Steve Harris, Mary Kay Miller, Stan and 
Shelley Corman.

Please let me know if you have additional changes by noon on Thursday, March

Also attached is a filing fact sheet that will be used as reference for media
