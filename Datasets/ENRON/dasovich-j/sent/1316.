Jeff,

Please pass this note onto whomever on the call asked the question "what 
would Enron be paid if there was an electricity curtailment?"

I talked with staff on the West Desk and confirmed that if there is an 
unscheduled electricity curtailment (i.e., rolling or widespread blackout) 
power scheduled by EES to a retail customer would still flow, assuming it had 
been prescheduled.  EPMI (acting as EES's scheduling coordinator, or SC) 
would be paid the ISO decremental  (dec) price for that power.  EPMI would 
pass that revenue (along with the cost of supplying that power) onto EES.  

If the blackout continued for some time (i.e., days), presumably EES would 
adjust its preschedule and there would be no net sales into the ISO.

Whether the retail customer gets a payment for being curtailed depends 
completely on the contract between EES and the customer.  Presumably the 
force majure provisions of the contract would protect EES from utility 
blackouts.
