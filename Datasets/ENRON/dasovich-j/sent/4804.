I'm trying.  I've got cauliflower ear from all the phone calls.  I'll be in 
Sacramento Monday.  Will keep you apprised.  I followed up with a call to 
Brulte and I'll try to meet with him on Monday, too.

Best,
Jeff

Subject: Phone Calls w/Large Customers re: Core/Noncore Proposal

I've had several phone calls with large customer groups over the past 
24-hours, mostly explaining our noncore/core proposal (in contrast to the one 
that the Assembly Democrats have launched which would saddle business with 
100% of the utilities' past debts).  As folks know, the cost shift provision 
of the Dems plans have been erroneously attributed to us in some cases.

The business folks have been very appreciative of the discussions and have 
recognized that, generally, our proposal is a fair and reasonable one.  They 
are going to try to set up direct negotiations with Hertzberg and have 
requested that I be part of those negotiations.  They are not sure that 
Hertzberg will go along with the idea, but they're going to try.  They will 
get back to me when they find out.  I'll report back soon as I hear something.
