Jeff, would this document be publically available, and how could we go about 
getting a copy?  The CPUC web site doesn't go back that far, although I 
assume that copies of the filed documents aren't available online anyway -- 
just summaries.

Thanks.

Well, I determined that it is a CPUC proceeding, but I can't find this 
document.  Can you provide a little more information, like date or who 
filed?  This is the web site that shows the last 100 documents out of the 133 
filed in this proceeding:  
http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/published/proceedings/I9907003.htm.
