If it's no cost to Enron, and if he's good and willing to commute to SF, and 
if it would be beneficial to the Company, we could certainly use the help and 
put him to work on interesting things.  

But do we we want to infect someone with the lunacy of California regulation 
and then potentially infect the UK?  Seriously, we can make it work if folks 
think that it makes sense.

Best,
Jeff
