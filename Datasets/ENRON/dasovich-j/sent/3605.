Let it go.  Ken is PR, and PR only.  There are also calls where substance is 
discussed. Ken can't do that.

		 Subject: Re: Ken

O.K.  Just received Janel's call re: Sue's concerns with utlizing Ken for PR 
calls.  

Here are my thoughts:

(1) There are three, and only three, purposes for spending money on the IEP, 
ARM and Direct Access Coalition efforts and thus three, and only three 
reasons,  for covering the IEP, ARM, and Direct Access Coalition calls.  The 
three reasons are:  

 (a) to find out what these various Coalitions are doing; 
 (b) to try and influence what they are doing so their activities advance our 
interests; and 
 (c) to coordinate what they are doing with what we are doing so we aren't 
wasting time, money or opportunities.

If these purposes are not being met, then let's stop wasting our time and 
money on these efforts (and the associated phone calls).

(2) From my standpoint, to meet these four purposes we need to have:  

 (a) somebody on the calls consistently that can advance our interests and 
answer questions when asked; 
 (b) somebody on the call that knows what we are doing in our national, 
California, and New York efforts; 
 (c) somebody preparing an email explaining what was discussed on the calls; 
and 
 (d) Janel coordinating what happens on the calls with what is going on in 
our national, Calilfornia, and New York efforts.  

(3) The only question given the above is:  "who can meet our purposes in 
participating in the IEP, ARM and Direct Access Coalition efforts."  
Originally I thought Ken was the person, because Ken is a PR person that we 
can count on (because we are paying him) to participate regularly in the 
calls and e-mail reports.  
(4)  Given Sue's concerns, I certainly don't object to Sue handling the 
calls.  However, we need to be consistent in our participation or be 
satisfied with inconsistent coverage.  It makes no sense to me to have Ken 
assigned sporadically to participate in calls that Sue can't participate in 
due to a conflict.   California is moving too quickly and too unpredictably 
for sporadic participation to provide any  value.

That's fine.  Just realize that I try to cover the same calls. There is also 
someone from ARM's PR firm, Edelman,  covering the IEP calls.

		 Subject: Ken

I just spoke with Janel and we concluded that we need to better coordinate 
our use of Ken's time.  We agreed that it would be a good idea for Ken to 
cover the IEP and Direct Access Coalition calls, meetings, etc. and report 
back to us about any conclusions reached.  

All future assignments for Ken should be coordinated through Janel.
