Ditto.  I vote that we suggest to Christine that 5's too darned unwieldy and 
that she look for another, smaller group.  And if she's unable to find one 
then we can talk.

Hi Jeff,

I am easy, it just gets difficult to coordinate the more people you have, 
it may be better of for her to find a smaller group, but if she has her 
sights set on us, that's fine with me.
