Thanks, Carolyn.  I can take a crack at the expansion questions, though 
someone else may want to also take a look at it, just to keep me honest.  
I'll try to distribute first thing in the AM tomorrow.

Best,
Jeff

I just spoke live with Mark about the case write-up.  Hope the following 
works for everyone.  
I will take a shot at comparing the following for questions (a) and (b): 
(1) Home Depot's strategy (low margin, high turnover, high service, best 
quality products) with their financial ratios. (2) Home Depot's strategy with 
Hechinger's (upscale stores with high profit margins) by comparing their 
financial ratios. 
(Understand that I have not had the benefit of attending the last two 
classes, but hope to watch them on video tape before I send out my answers.) 
Mark has already addressed question (c), we just need to make clear in the 
memo the assumptions he used.  Mark - perhaps you could write those up so we 
can drop them into the memo?
The other big issue is with Home Depot's expansion strategy - should they 
continue to build the 9 new stores, and if so, how should they finance the 
expansion?  They could use their line of credit or go to the equity market.  
Obviously with the line of credit we need to make sure that they can cover 
the interest expense and with the equity market we need to be careful of 
their depressed stock price.  Can someone else volunteer to look at the 
expansion efforts and financing (question d)?
I am going to work on this today and hope to e-mail it out by 9am tomorrow.  
Can we set a time on Wednesday to discuss this live?

Subject: Home Depot Spreadsheet (revised) 

Jeff was kind enough to show me where to get the additional balance sheet 
items I needed to finish the financial ratio time sheet analysis (I missed 
the selected financial statement table).  Please see the revised spreadsheet 
that has both the financial ratios and the pro forma cash flow statement for 
the next fiscal year.
