Per our conversation, here's a copy of the curves that need updating.  If 
possible, could you get them to me by tomorrow afternoon?  Sorry for the 
rush.  Gotta talk on Thursday.  I want to superimpose on the curves the 
rates  that Loretta just put in place for 500 KW and above (for Edison and 
PG&E).  Can you do that if I get you the rates?  Thanks a million.

Best,
Jeff
