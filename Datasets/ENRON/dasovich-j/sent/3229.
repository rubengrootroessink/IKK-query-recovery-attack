I'm told that APS filed against PG&E and "APEC"? also filed against PG&E.

Best,

FYI, the attached PGE filing makes mention of two complaints filed with the 
CPUC seeking collection of unpaid PX credits.  Peggy, if the press tracks 
these complaints down, you may get several press inquiries tomorrow. 
Jeff, can we figure out who filed  the other complaint?
Please forward as appropriate.

Please see the bold language in the article below about PG&E's recent SEC 
filing.  Sounds like our "negative CTC's."  

Michael--do you have a copy of that SEC filing?  MDS


NEW YORK (Reuters) - PG&E Corp.(NYSE:PCG - news), embattled parent of Pacific 
Gas & Electric Co., said on Wednesday it is examining a restructuring of its 
bank loans and commercial paper, and that bank lenders on a $1 billion 
revolving credit facility to its California electric utility unit won't act 
upon that unit's previously announced default until March 6. 
San Francisco-based PG&E made the disclosures in a filing late Wednesday with 
the Securities and Exchange Commission (news - web sites) (SEC). The utility 
had about $1 billion in cash as of Tuesday, PG&E said. 
A similar bank deadline affecting credit lines of Southern California Edison 
(news - web sites), that state's No. 2 utility and a unit of Rosemead, 
Calif.-based Edison International(NYSE:EIX - news), was to expire on Tuesday. 
PG&E also said in its filing that as of Monday, Pacific G&E, California's No. 
1 utility, may not have paid as much as $433 million of ``energy credits'' to 
customers who have chosen to buy their electric energy from a provider other 
than Pacific G&E. The utility is required under state regulations to offer 
the credits, it said. 
Pacific G&E and SoCal Edison have been unable to recover about $12 billion 
because of a rate freeze imposed under California's 1996 utility deregulation 
law, which has left them unable to pass on their soaring wholesale power 
costs to consumers.
