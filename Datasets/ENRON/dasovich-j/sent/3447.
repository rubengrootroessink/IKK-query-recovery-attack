Tomorow night at Atlas Cafe the Dark Hollow Band is playing, featuring Larry 
Cohea on banjo, that guy who tried to kiss Prentice on guitar (John 
Kornhauser), and that thick-glasses, stick-thin, white-trash lookin' woman 
on bass (y'all know the one, 'specially you Cameron). I figure we should go 
on down there as a preliminary rage for Jeff's Fowtee-ieth. What you say? 
Goes from 8-10, so they say.

LATE!
