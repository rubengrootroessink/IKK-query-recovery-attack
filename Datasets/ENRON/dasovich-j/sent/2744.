This is what I received from the Westwood Marquis which has undergone a
renovation.  (I replied and told them to correct the address.)  Let me know
if this is OK.  I don't know if  we can find a cheaper place, but if you
think this rate is too high I can try.  Also, I made reservations to go to
Burbank on Dec. 31 using Southwest Airlines and leaving from Oakland at
10:40 am, arriving at 11:40.  Returning on Jan. 1 at 8:15 pm and arriving at
9:20.  However, I learned from Cameron that all but your mother and I will
be going on Dec. 30 so I  will cancel that part of the reservation.  I don't
know  what your plans are for returning so I will not be making any  other
reservations unless I hear from you.  I originally made the returning
reservation at the time I did so that if we came back to the house on Monday
to watch football games and  play games we would have some time to do that.
If we don't do that we could possibly get an earlier flight back.  Your
mother doesn't want to come  back too late, so your mother and I couldn't
possibly watch a movie if Hef has one planned for later, but you might
consider that possibility.  Our check-in time at the W is 3:00 pm,  possibly
earlier.  I assume you got my message left on the answering  machine that
everyone  has been invited to the party.
