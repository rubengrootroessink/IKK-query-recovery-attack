Having worked with you on the Perfect project, I now know that your power 
point skills are legendary.  Would you mind volunteering to coordinate 
putting all the stuff in to power point?

Jeff - Thanks for putting so much work into this. Excellent job!

I agree that we should figure out when we can meet again. I can meet
tonight, during break on Tuesday and basically anytime on Saturday or
Sunday. During break on Thursday I volunteered to help Diane with a new
student's reception, but I can cancel that if need be. What does everyone
else's schedule look like?

OK folks. It's about 80% of the way there. My brains are oozing out
looking at cells, so I want to get this around so Mark can get started on
refining assumptions and other folks can examine as well. I'll continue to
check it and de-bug it. Mark, you and I should talk, too. (You'll note
that at this point, the valuation is in the $30s, so there's work to do.)
Apologies in advance for any errors (and I'm sure they're there).

If anyone has any questions on the model, just let me know.

I think we ought to get together to meet this week as much as possible to
start g! etting the power point presentation together. And perhaps we should
think about meeting this weekend?

In the meantime, I'm pulling together the data on Buffet (Berkshire
Hathaway) stock performance, etc., and will also do the financial ratios,
including Dupont, for OAT.

Does this work for folks? Other thoughts?

Best,
Jeff
