Here's a recap of our demo meeting with Enron's Global Strategic Sourcing=
=20
group on Tuesday...

?

Demo went well.? In attendance for Perfect were Ian, James M and David Y.?=
=20
Enron's attendees were:


- John Gillespie - Sr Director GSS - Platforms & Processes (decision maker)
- Pam Tragesser - GSS Operations Mgr (asst to Derryl C - Sr Dir GSS -=20
Operations)
- John Will - Director Sourcing - Pipe Valves & Fittings
- Craig Brown - Director Sourcing - Chemicals, Oils & Lubricants
- Shirley Jo Dickens-Wilson - Enron Transportation Services Procurement Mgr
- Eugene Ribaudo - Enron Energy Services Procurement Mgr - ibuyit.com team=
=20
lead
- Ken Sommers - Enron Energy Services Procurement Mgr

?

Despite only having 1 hour to present, Ian competently ran through a compan=
y=20
and feature overview, then blasted through a demo of PS2 and PPD.? We did n=
ot=20
get to show PI.? They all bought in that this was a sophisticated sourcing=
=20
tool, that it followed their processes and would help streamline their=20
operation.? Only negatives we heard was that the $1M price tag was a show=
=20
stopper, and that they were trying to minimize RFQs and focus on release=20
against agreements.? With 2000 revs at over $100B, and a spend to match tha=
t,=20
their ROI would be tremendous.?=20

?

Shirley Jo said that her primary use of this system would be for any purcha=
se=20
over $50k, which requires 3 bids.? She does not feel that she has enough of=
=20
these events to justify implementation in her ETS group.?=20

?

Their current processes are basically pen, paper, phone and fax.? They do u=
se=20
RFQ templates and Excel spreadsheets.? They also model Total Cost of=20
Ownership - evaluating the total lifecycle of materials.

?

They are using their homegrown auction platform, DealBench, and were trying=
=20
to compare this against our system.? Their transaction fees for using the=
=20
DealBench system are minor, so our pricing looks high, but that would be=20
comparing apples against oranges.? I will address this in the cover letter =
on=20
the pilot proposal we will send.

?

Questions that came up included:


- What is the difference between maverick spend in Procurement vs Sourcing?=
?=20
Ian responded Perfect reduces maverick spend during the sourcing cycle by=
=20
standardizing company best practices and providing visibility/accountabilit=
y=20
of vendor selection criteria.

- How does the optimization calculation work?? Ian gave basic explanation o=
f=20
input variables and ranking/scoring.? Don't feel we need to elaborate on th=
is=20
at this point, possibly in future.

- Can we utilize a hands-on demo to play with the system?? We suggested a=
=20
pilot, but also said that it might be possible to work something out over=
=20
Webex just to test drive a little more before moving into a pilot.

?

We agreed that the next step is for us to send a pilot proposal and they wi=
ll=20
get together either Friday or sometime next week to review the proposal,=20
discuss their opinions and determine the next step.
?

-----------------------

?

I sent the Pilot Proposal and cover letter out today by email after final=
=20
approval by Ian.? I will followup on Monday to find out what their evaluati=
on=20
gameplan is and to suggest meetings so that we can get ROI inputs to allow=
=20
James to workup an ROI proposal.?=20
