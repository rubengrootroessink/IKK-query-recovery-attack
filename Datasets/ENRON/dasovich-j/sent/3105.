Be happy to talk tonite about how to pull this together.  Can't do it until 
8:30-9PM tonite, though.  That too late?  And, if that's not enough, I don't 
have conferencing capability from home.  Suggestions?

Best,
Jeff

FYI-

Tasker has approved my assumptions for the cash flow statement so we are free 
to
answer the questions.

Mark - I apologize for the delay in responding.  I had to fly back East due
to a family illness and had problems accessing my email from there.  Your
assumptions are fine.  As to your previous email, I think the additional
B/S data on pp 9-47 and 9-48 gives you what you need for prior years.

Hope that helps - sorry again for the delay!
