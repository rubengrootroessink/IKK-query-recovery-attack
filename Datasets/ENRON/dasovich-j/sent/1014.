Professor Michaels, 

Further to the voicemail message I left for you today regarding speaking 
early next year at the IPPSA Conference in Banff, Alberta the details are: 

Topic: The California Experience - Lessons that Alberta Can Learn From (or 
something like this title - although I was unable to open the presentation on 
your website entitled" "California's Electrical Disaster and the Furture of 
Competitive Power" I would expect based on this title that much of what is in 
that presentation would be of interest to those attending the IPPSA 
Conference. 

Date: Monday March 19, 2001 13:00 - 13:30 (Conference is 2 full days - March 
19-20, 2001)

Reimbursements: Travel (economy class) and one night at Rimrock Hotel.  Also 
free conference registration (which includes meals during conference).

Deadline for presentation materials so they can be included in the conference 
binder: February 28, 2001

Conference Information: the conference is held at the Rimrock Hotel in Banff, 
Alberta and has been sold out the last three years.  It will attract about 
400 delegates in 2001 from across Canada and the U.S. with the majority of 
the delegates being generation developers, large consumers, marketers, and 
policy makers from Western Canada. The speakers include a number of respected 
academics/consultants from across North America, senior industry 
representatives, senior government representatives, and senior 
representatives from the Alberta Transmission Administrator and Power Pool of 
Alberta. 

I look forward to your reply.  My telephone number is (403) 974-6746.

Regards,

Rob Hemstock
