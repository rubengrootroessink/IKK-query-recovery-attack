The way we handled it last time was 1) have a quick chat about it, 2) split 
up the pieces, 3) once written, pass around the pieces to see if anyone has 
any strong feelings about what folks had pulled together, and then, for each 
case, 4) designate one person as the "assembler" of the pieces.  (We 
designated who would be responsible for which cases at the beginning of the 
semester.)  And yes, all by email (save for, say, the preliminary chat).  It 
worked well.  But I'm flexible, if folks want to try another angle.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff,

How would you suggest it would work writing it jointly via an internet
discussion group?

Haven't received anything.  Sounds like we all agree that it would be a
good idea to do it.  I'll write the prof an email and ask him to email us
the file.  My preference (in order to actually learn something--i'm sort of
thick) is to work on these jointly rather than have one person do it each
week, but i'm willing to discuss.  others have views on how we ought to
write 'em up?

Best,
Jeff

I, too, read the case and was prepared to write a memo except for the
crucial
fact that I have no idea what the prof. is looking for.  I haven't seen the
suggested questions which I assume will point us in the right direction.

I took a look at the case last night.  It is very short and appears to be
somewhat straight forward.  We may want to work on this one as insurance.

Has anyone received the files with the suggested questions and spreadsheets
yet?

Dylan
