did they charge your credit card, too?  if they double-booked us, we better 
get a free weekend out of it (in addition to getting the money back).

Because Jeff told us that he wasn't going to play, I assumed we all weren't 
going to play. So I went ahead and made plans for us to go see my mom (and 
my uncle and his family) this weekend in San Diego... Sorry about that. I 
leave at 12:30 on Friday, and Cameron comes down at 6:30.

P.S. I'd think about staying if the gig paid for that spurious $740.00 bill 
from Squaw.
