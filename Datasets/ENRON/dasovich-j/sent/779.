as you know, prentice is a world class procrastinator---i've been trying to 
get her to get in touch with steve, larry, ed & co. for about a month to see 
if they can play on the weekend of dec. 16/17, and she, of course, ain't done 
it.  by the way, i may have found a really cool "compound" in stinson beach.  
could you get in touch with those guys and see if they can do it.  sorry to 
bug you with it, but i think it's best if you guys contact them.  thanks a 
million.
