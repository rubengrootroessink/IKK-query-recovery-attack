Jeff,

Here are some suggestions:

11 Sonoma Patio
3 Walla Vista         These 3 are nearby each other-
4 Sacramento Patio  <--this one has hot tub-all have lots
                       of patio space.
19 Brighton Avenue   <--In Bolinas, but it would fit
                        everyone in one house.

I will not be in on Wednesday or Thursday, so ask for Sarah if you call
then.

Thanks,
Sam
