Pennsylvania's First Successful CDS Auction
=20
An important new regulatory skirmish has broken out before the Pennsylvania=
=20
Public Utility Commission (PUC) over which company has won the right to=20
provide default generation service to 300,000 customers of PECO Energy, an=
=20
Exelon Company. This skirmish is actually good news for consumers and is th=
e=20
fruit of the 1998 PECO Energy restructuring settlement agreement, a landmar=
k=20
document that ended a ferocious regulatory war when all combatants signed i=
t.=20
=20
The =01&peace treaty=018 includes a requirement that PECO Energy bid out de=
fault=20
service for 20% of its customers, and PECO has done so. Green Mountain Ener=
gy=20
Company is now challenging PECO Energy=01,s decision that New Power won the=
=20
auction to provide the settlement=01,s mandated default service.=20
=20
Both Green Mountain and New Power are offering those 300,000 consumers smal=
l=20
rate reductions compared to customers receiving default service from PECO,=
=20
and more electricity generated from renewable energy resources. Specificall=
y,=20
New Power and Green Mountain are offering generation service to Rate R=20
residential customers for approximately 5.54 cents per kilowatt-hour. That=
=20
offer is 3.11 cents per kilowatt-hour less than PECO Energy=01,s unbundled=
=20
generation and transmission rate of 8.65 cents per kilowatt-hour and 0.11=
=20
cents per kilowatt-hour less than the shopping credit of 5.65.=20
=20
The consumer savings that these offers represent is masked or reduced by th=
e=20
stranded cost payments that consumers must pay PECO Energy. Indeed, were it=
=20
not for stranded cost payments, the New Power and Green Mountain offers wou=
ld=20
reduce total bills by about 3.11 cents per kilowatt-hour, or 20%.=20
=20
The dispute between New Power and Green Mountain is noteworthy because it=
=20
proves that companies will compete vigorously to provide default service if=
=20
shopping credits and lengths of contracts are set at reasonable levels. It=
=20
also shows that renewable energy portfolio standards can be met economicall=
y.=20
Finally, the result of this case will switch more customers to competitive=
=20
suppliers in one day than the total number who switched in California over =
a=20
period of nearly three years.=20
=20
When the PUC anoints New Power or Green Mountain as the winner, if all=20
299,300 consumers opt to stay with the CDS provider, the total number of=20
customers in Pennsylvania that will be served by a competitive supplier wil=
l=20
jump to more than 850,000. Of this total, 504,000 will be residential=20
customers of PECO, a number equal to 37% of the PECO residential class.
=20
CDS Background: In Pennsylvania, there must always be a =01&default=018 sup=
plier or=20

to all=20
customers. The incumbent utility is the default supplier, unless the PUC=20
decides otherwise. The default supplier must provide generation service to=

customers who do not have a competitive supplier either because they chose=

The same approach was used in the other Settlements in the GPU, PPL and APS=

restructuring cases. CDS reflects an effort to assure that there is at leas=

PECO=01,s CDS RFP: Importantly, the PECO/Unicom merger case modified the CD=

the revisions eliminated the =01&customer care=018 functions from CDS, made=

yielded no successful CDS contract.=20
=20
PECO issued its initial RFP for CDS on April 6, 2000, and Shell Energy=20
Services submitted the only bid. However, the PUC rejected the bid as=20
non-conforming and denied Shell=01,s Petition for Reconsideration of its=20
decision. Pursuant to the modifications in the merger settlement, PECO=20
entered into bilateral negotiations based on an August 24, 2000 RFP.=20
=20
Three suppliers submitted conforming bids, and PECO selected New Power as t=

winner on October 18, 2000. New Power is the new competitive supplier=20

service territory and is backed by Enron, AOL, and IBM.=20
=20
PECO and New Power negotiated a complete contract that is before the PUC fo=
r=20
approval on November 9, 2000. Under the proposal, PECO and New Power expand=
ed=20
the size of the CDS requirement to include 22% (299,300) of non-shopping=20
residential customers instead of 20% of all residential customers, whether=
=20
shopping or not. This change was designed to implement paragraph 39 of the=
=20
Restructuring Settlement, requiring adjustments to the numbers assigned to=
=20
CDS in order to have 35% of all PECO residential and commercial customers=
=20
obtaining competitive generation as of January 1, 2001. There also will be =
a=20
second round of assignment of non-shopping customers as of October 15, 2002=

if New Power is providing CDS to fewer than 20% of all PECO residential=20
customers
=20
New Power electricity will be 2% renewable in 2001, 2.5% renewable in 2002,=

and 3% renewable in 2003 as required, but does not include a commitment to=

portion of the product.=20
=20
The price for New Power=01,s CDS for Rate R customers would be 2.02% below =
the=20
shopping credit, while residential heating customers on Rate RH would pay=
=20
1.02% less than their shopping credit. For a Rate R customer, this would me=
an=20
that overall rates would fall .8% (as energy and transmission falls from 5.=
65=20
to 5.54); for Rate RH rates would fall .44%. Customers assigned to CDS may=
=20
still choose any competitive supplier, or opt out and retain default servic=

from PECO without penalty or charge. New Power will be able to offer its fu=
ll=20
slate of energy and non-energy related products to these customers.
=20
Green Mountain asserts that approval of the PECO/New Power contract is =01&=
not=20
in the public interest,=018 arguing that PECO ignored Green Mountain=01,s o=
ffer=20
that included CDS pricing 2% below the shopping credit for all residential=
=20
customers, including those on residential heating or off-peak service. Like=
=20
the New Power proposal, the Green Mountain proposal would lower Rate R and =
RH=20
rates .8% and .44%, respectively. Green Mountain asserts that the New Power=
=20
rate cut for Rate R is only 1.83%, and not 2% and argues that its product i=
s=20
better for the environment because the non-renewable portion of the product=
=20
would come from natural gas and hydro instead of system power generated=20
primarily from coal and nuclear fuels. If not declared the winning bidder,=
=20
Green Mountain proposes in the alternative that both they and New Power=20
receive CDS contracts.
=20
In response, PECO states that all three bidders had the opportunity to subm=

revised bids and that the Green Mountain revised bid was not submitted unti=

October 12, 2000, 13 days after the deadline and nine days after the=20

The PUC will sort out the facts and arguments on November 9. Some think tha=

the PUC may very well split the 300,000 customer block between Green Mounta=

Whatever the result, customers in the Philadelphia area should receive yet=
