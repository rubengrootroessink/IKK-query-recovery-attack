It's always darkest before the light (though it may not get light in our 
lifetimes).

Looks great.  Couple of points:

1) Despite promises to the contrary--common theme in this exercise--Burton 
(as I understand) did not remove the condemnation (expropriation?) language 
from ABx6, i.e., the state can just take your power plant (or anything else, 
it seems), if it has the inkling.  That's an egregious provision in ABx6.

2) I don't recall trying to amend ABx18 to say, "pay them their PX credits."  
I understood the tactic to be--get a prospective, date certain end to the 
freeze in the bill, which then gives us very firm legal ground on which to 
seek and get the money owed to us.  We could seek the additional language, 
but if putting date certain does the same thing without attracting a lot of 
attention, may be a preferable path.

3) Forgive me if I've just overlooked it, but I got wind of a bill by Ms 
Migden (ABx8?)  that gives one whole heckuvalot of new power--power usually 
left to FERC--to the CA Electricity Oversight Board.  Anyone know about it?  
We may want to get details for inclusion in the discussion with Delainey.  

Best,
Jeff
