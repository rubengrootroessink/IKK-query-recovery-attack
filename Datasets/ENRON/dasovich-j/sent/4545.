Michael:  did we decide to use the PUC's load numbers?  I would worry about 
that (particularly since we use the MOU QF/IOU gen numbers).  I suggest that 
we use the MOU load numbers for the three utilities, since the PUC numbers 
seem real screwy e.g., they have PG&E's load being smaller than Edison.

Best,
Jeff
