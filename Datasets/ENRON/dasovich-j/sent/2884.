Hey buddy.  I know that you're up in Sacramento and have a much better lay of 
the land than I, but this looks a like a sure fire set up for "the man for 
all seasons" to make an appearance before the legislature.  I have deep 
concerns about us sticking our necks out at these hearings.  Again, have much 
better info, but by all accounts, "witch hunt" seems to be the operative term 
for the hearings.  We are doing very well for ourselves working behind the 
scenes and the risks to us of having someone at a public leg hearing, with 
all the cameras, and all the politicians feeling the primordial urge to 
grandstand are very high.  Let's please discuss this one long and hard before 
making an decision.  I'll be in Sac on the 16th for an AB 1890 Group meeting 
and plan to attend the hearing.

Your pal,
Jeff

There will be an oversight subcommittee of the new committee formed to
shape energy policy in the Special Session.  In a meeting today,
Assembly Member Darryl Steinberg, who will Chair the subcommittee, told
us he expects to hold two hearings to "track the money" between
utilities, geneators and wholesalers.  He hopes to wait until after the
completion of the PUC audit, unless that audit drags on longer than the
next week or so.  He is planning a "constructive investigation" and
pledges to be fair.  The subcommttee will be staffed by the Speakers
Office of Oversight.

Also, Enron has been invited to testify at an informational hearing of
the Assembly Utilities and Commerce Committee on January 16, 2001.  The
general topiic is how supply and demand affect the California market and
what options are available for new or repowered generation in
California.
