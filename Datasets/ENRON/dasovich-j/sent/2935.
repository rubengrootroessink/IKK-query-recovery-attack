Dean Tyson:

It was a pleasure to see you again today. Phil, it was a pleasure to meet y=
ou=20
and I look forward to working together.  Since time is of the essence, I=20
wanted to summarize where we left off at today=01,s meeting regarding Calif=
ornia=01,
s energy crisis.  That summary is attached.  I've also attached three=20
articles from the business section of today's Chronicle that arguably bolst=
er=20
our arguments for adopting the approach that we discussed at today's meetin=
g.

 Given the fact that the legislative process is moving rapidly, bankruptcy =
is=20
a daily threat, and Dean Tyson will be attending the meetings in Davos, it=
=20
appears that our window of opportunity is very small.  It seems that succes=
s=20
requires a meeting of the principals by the end of the week, if not sooner.=
 =20
The chances of success are obviously limited, but I think that we agreed th=
at=20
all concerned have nothing to lose and everything to gain by taking a shot.=
=20
Your offer to help in the effort obviously increases the likelihood of=20
success and is greatly appreciated. =20

My apologies in advance if I have mischaracterized any of the points made a=
t=20
the meeting.  It represents a =01&first cut,=018 it will undoubtedly change=
 as the=20
details get worked out, and I=01,m sure I=01,ve missed something.  So pleas=
e don=01,t=20
hesitate to edit the draft.

Please keep in mind that I have not had a chance to discuss this proposal=
=20
internally.  As such, I can=01,t yet commit Enron to the specifics of the=
=20
proposal.  But I=01,m confident that the company can support something akin=
 to=20
this structure and can let you and Phil know first thing Monday.

In addition, given the political environment in California, Enron has playe=
d=20
a constructive role by providing low-key, behind the scenes advice and=20
analysis to policy makers.  That approach seems preferable in this effort a=
s=20
well.

Finally, Dean Tyson, I mentioned that Linda Robertson heads-up our Washingt=
on=20
D.C. office.  If she can help in any way, please don=01,t hesitate to let m=
e=20
know.  Both of you should feel free to call me at home over the weekend to=
=20
discuss things further.  My home phone is 415.621.8317.

Best,
Jeff
