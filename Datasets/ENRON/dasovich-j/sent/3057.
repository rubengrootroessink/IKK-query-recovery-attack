Dear Jeff:

Sorry I didn't get back to you last week. I was sick on Thursday and
Friday and only dealt with a couple of things.  Unfortunately, not much to
report.  Letter sent to Governor's office.  Not even a courtesy call in
return.  I spoke with Lynn Schenk on Thursday.  She told me point blank
that the Governor and his staff had already solved the energy crisis and
that it was too late to convene a meeting such as LDT was
suggesting.  Please DO NOT pass on this informationto anyone else in the
"Berkeley group."  We'll probably try to reach Schenk again
today.  Marybeth
