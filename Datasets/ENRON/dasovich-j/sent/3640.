Greetings:

Sounds like I'm glad that I missed the quiz last week.

Hate to be a nag, but we've got to turn in what we're doing for our project 
on Thursday.  I propose doing a nice, clean merger, which would allow us to 
do both comparative analysis (who are these companies?) and merger/valuation 
analysis.  Mark and I talked last night and I pleaded again not to do strict 
accounting stuff, but if that's what folks would like to do, I can certainly 
suck it up.  Any thoughts?

Best,
Jeff
