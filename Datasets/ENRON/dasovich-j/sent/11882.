>   NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Those who have opposed wholesale electricity price
> controls have been labeled as extreme free-market ideologues who are
> insensitive
> to the practical impacts on peoples' lives of high electricity prices.
>   But the most common argument against price caps has been logical, not
> ideological: Price controls have never worked. Market participants always
> find a
> way around the rules.
>   This week the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission decided that it will
> have

> control
> ruling. The initial price cap rule, set by the California Independent
> System
> Operator last spring, was only a few paragraphs long. Each successive
> price cap
> order has gotten longer, though effectiveness still appears out of reach.
> The
> FERC's April order was 28 pages long; the June order was 48 pages. And now
> additional rules are on call to plug the new loopholes.
>   The revisions will also try to repair damage done to the market by the
> June
> order. During a spell of very hot weather Monday, Sierra Pacific Resources
> (SRP)
> subsidiary Nevada Power had to initiate limited rolling blackouts to a
> small
> number of customers for 45 minutes. The company attributed the blackouts,
> in
> part, to the new price controls.
>   Sierra Pacific's chief spokesman, Paul Heagen, provided a bird's eye
> view of
> the practical realities of the FERC's new price cap regime.
>   Power Points: After having a few days to look into it, can you say that
> price
> caps definitely contributed to blackouts in Nevada on Monday?
>   Paul Heagen: Yes, but first let me say that all of it was unintentional.
> FERC
> was trying to do the right thing. Price caps were a noble effort to solve
> a real

>   But on Monday the market needed speed and clarity to function. It had
> neither,

>   PP: How, specifically, are the caps having this effect?
>   PH: There are a couple of elements. The 10% premium for power sold to
> California is supposed to reflect concerns about credit. That 10% in an
> open
> market is no big deal, but in a constrained situation the seller will grab
> it,
> because now it's his only chance to make money.
>   Also, the way this is set up, they look backwards. They determine the
> price
> after the fact. I can't think of any business in the world where you sell
> a
> product and find out later what price you sold at.
>   This had a very chilling effect on people's willingness to sell.
> Normally, a
> cloud cover comes in and a utility has a little extra power to sell in the
> real-time market. Normally, those little 50-megawatt packets move pretty
> easily,
> and that's really important for maintaining reliability.
>   With the price cap, utilities hunkered down. Selling at $92 wasn't worth
> the
> risk. They figured they might as well hang on in case they needed it.
>   Also, we have a voluntary curtailment program that allows us to share
> savings

> might
> pay them $250/MWh to curtail demand. But in a $92/mkt, we can offer them
> such a

>   PP: Have you talked to FERC about these problems with the price
> controls?
>   PH: We've had a senior team in Washington, D.C., at the FERC since last
> week.
> Right away we saw another effect of the FERC order: It penalizes companies

>   The biggest issue for us, is, did FERC really mean to penalize companies
