I'm sorry, I'm losing my mind.? did you send Amber's address?? if so, i've 
deleted it. could you send again?? also, are you sure you don't want the 
tickets?? they come with free parking (it ain't the closest lot, but hey, it 
saves 20$).? also, please let me know when you've confirmed with the G.O. 
that 
you don't want to do road, so that I can tell Jeff.? And of course we'll pick 
up 
the football forms, just make sure they're somewhere easy to find (butcher 
block 
table?).? we'll be coming up tomorrow evening to pick up all the stuff.? 
how's 
the canopy?? you and eldon playing ping pong?
