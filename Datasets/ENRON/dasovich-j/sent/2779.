Thanks for the articles.  Well, not quite in PJs, but yes, working from home, 
which is some consolation.  PG&E has said that a signficant share of gas 
suppliers have stopped transacting with PG&E due to credit risk.  Our 
exposure to PG&E is huge (both EES and ENA), so I wouldn't be surprised if 
we've stopped transacting with them until the Commission comes out with its 
decision on the 4th and we see how the ratings agencies respond.  I can find 
out first thing Tuesday morning.

And a very happy and safe new year to you, too.

Best,
Jeff

So are you in your PJs working at your computer at home?  Just teasing!  
Thought you'd be interested in these LA Times articles.  FYI, I got two calls 
yesterday (Dow Jones and Bloomberg) about us refusing to sell gas to PG&E -- 
all the traders were gone, so I couldn't get an answer and Steve didn't 
know.  Let me know if you hear anything.

Happy New Year!
