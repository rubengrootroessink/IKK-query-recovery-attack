John Yurkanin (CA ISO) is my former boss at BP Gas.  I'd be happy to talk 
with them about excess capacity.

Hi Jim: 

As we discussed, your client, the California Independent System Operator, 
contracted with MCI to build a high-speed, broad band network (predominately 
OC-48?)as the platform to launch electricity deregulation in California.  
Since that time, the ISO has discovered that it has capacity substantially in 
excess of what it needs to operate the grid (and certain markets for power, 
e.g., ancillary services).  

Rather than try to re-negotiate the contract with MCI, the ISO is now looking 
at marketing the capacity.  Sounds like the capacity runs between Sacramento 
(Folsom?) and Southern California (Alhambra?).  Please correct any 
(unintended) inaccuracies I may have included in this very brief description.

Tom Gros is VP of Enron's global bandwidth trading group and can help 
determine the value/feasibility of having the ISO make use of Enron's 
bandwith trading platform.

Tom, meet Jim.  Jim, meet Tom

Best,
Jeff
