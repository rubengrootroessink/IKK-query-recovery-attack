Note that SCE does not list the information in their SEC disclosures but 
Robert had some 1999 figures.   Comparing PGE at the sales level, they were 
at 79.2 mln MWH in 1999 versus 78.2 for SCE in 1999.    This leads me to 
believe the 93 mln for PGE and 83 million for SCE in the MOU slide is flat 
wrong on the PGE figure.   We will need to resolve this.

can we use the MOU total load numbes (e.g., 93 GWH for PG&E) and divide it up 
using the proportions in the PG&E numbers?
