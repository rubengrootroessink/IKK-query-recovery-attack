Just had a long internal meeting.  Over the next 24 hours, we're going to try 
to simulate on California a potential solution we devised in the meeting.  No 
sense in offering something up if we don't know what the numbers look like, 
at least in a "ball park" sense.   I should be able to get you something 
fairly concrete by end of day tomorrow or first thing Wednesday.  That work?  
Have fun tomorrow.

Best,
Jeff
