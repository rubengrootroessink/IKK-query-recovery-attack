Subject: IMPORTANT -- Letter to Governor Davis


Folks-
At today's meeting, those Group members who attended agreed that we should
indeed send the letter with changes reflecting the new legislation. Attached
is the newest draft of such a letter. We need to send this letter out FRIDAY
so in order to do that please look over the letter carefully and let me know
if your organization wishes to be included as a signatory. I need every set
of eyes out there to look this letter over for spelling, grammar and
content -- my eyes have seen it too many times and are apt to miss things.
So, here is the process ---

Let me know of any minor changes ASAP. If there are content changes please
email them to the ENTIRE group for sign off. Please understand that we want
to send this FRIDAY so we do not have a lot of time to make changes. When I
have a final draft I will ask people to fax signatures or send originals to
me by Friday.Thank you all for your help with this letter. We could not have
done it with out you.

We will be scheduling our next general meeting for mid October. Also, we
have finalized the dates for the Annual Retreat and will be sending out
packets with all the details next week. DJ and I are working on the agenda
so if you have a specific topic you would like covered please let us know.
As always, please send me an email or give me a call if you have any
concerns or questions about the letter or any other matter.

Thanks,
Delaney
