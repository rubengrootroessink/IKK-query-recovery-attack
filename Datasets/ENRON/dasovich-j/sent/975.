Thanks Harry.  This is important and we've discussed making sure that Neil 
and Jubran (and you, for that matter) be included in any distribution that 
includes ENA West.  Consider it done.  Unless others have any problems, I 
suggest that going forward any emails, materials, phone conversations, etc. 
that include ENA also include EES.  I don't think that we have any legal 
issues associated with including both ENA and EES, but if I'm missing 
something, please let me know.  Thoughts?

Neil Bresnan and Jubran Whalan are in Dennis Benevides' group and are 
assigned to California.  Neil contacted me and asked that he and Jubran be 
brought into all the loops on how we are handling wholesale issues in 
California.  They are somewhat disturbed that they are not getting the same 
access to information and influence as ENA West Desk.  I know I have 
underestimated their need for independent involvement, but can we immediately 
start involving them in everything  - through e-mails, conference calls, 
request for comments, etc.

Jeff - could you call me with any particular strategy you think we should 
follow here - meetings or whatever.  Thanks.
