Greetings Ms Carson:

I'm giving a presentation on gas issues on Tuesday.  I've got a draft of the 
message points that Shelly Corman circulated on 9.28 regarding "why gas 
prices have increased" (have those changed?); I've got Ken Lay's gas 
presentation before the National Governor's Conference (9.20.00); and Gil 
Muhl's presentation to the AGA  in Washington D.C. on 9.19.00.  Are there 
other presentations that would useful to look at in preparation for the 
talk?  And are there any recent analyses by CERA, PIRA etc. about gas 
nationally, in the West, and in California that you could forward.  And if 
you get a chance, could you give a ring?  I've got a couple of questions.  As 
always, greatly appreciated.

Best,
Jeff
