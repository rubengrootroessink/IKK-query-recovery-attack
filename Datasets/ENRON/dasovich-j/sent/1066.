I like it.  Give it one final read through for final refinements.  Then send 
to bay guardian, sf weekly, pacific sun (marin), (and the east bay has a 
weekly mag, too, the name of which escapes me--might be out of berkeley).  
Any of these would give good exposure, and likelihood of someone of your 
caliber getting in is pretty high.
