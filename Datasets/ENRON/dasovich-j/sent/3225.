I am going to order the last of the 12 bottle units that I can order (per 
this memo below) but I do not want all 12 - do you guys want to share in 
this allocation?

RE:             E&G Purchases of Opus One 




While demand for Opus One has grown significantly, case production has 
remained level if in fact not declined-and will decline further for the 
1998 vintage. This has lead to very strict allocations in the marketplace 
and a need to conserve. 

Please note as of March 1, 2001, for all employees and growers of Opus One, 
Robert Mondavi Winery and Baron Philippe de Rothschild, purchase limits on 
the current vintage of Opus One will change from twelve to six 750 ml. 
bottles per person.  We expect to offer the current vintage, the 1997, 
until October of this year, at which time the 1998 will be released. 

Thank you in advance for your understanding and cooperation.
