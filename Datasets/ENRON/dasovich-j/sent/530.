Paul,

I've put out a request to some of them to get together and will follow up.  
One problem is that talking to Jerry Jordan or Tony Braun will be liking 
talking to a wall.  I think we need to get with some of the other, more sane 
members of the muni community. 
What is anyone hearing about how this is being received?  In my view, the 
best thing that could happen is that it gets ignored and they become further 
irrelevant.   If anyone in the legislature or elsewhere is taking this at all 
seriously, then we definitely ought to try to meet with them.   Having said 
that, this has S. David Freeman written all over it, and between him and 
Jordan, I don't hold out much hope for  changing their views.
