HEADLINE: Dynegy and NRG Energy Announce Long-term Agreement With California
 Department of Water Resources
 
DATELINE: HOUSTON & MINNEAPOLIS, March 6, 2001
 
BODY:
 
 
   Dynegy Inc. (NYSE:DYN) and NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NRG) today announced
that their affiliates, El Segundo Power LLC, Long Beach Generation LLC and
Cabrillo I LLC, have entered into an agreement with the California
Department of Water Resources (DWR) to provide the state with up to 2,300
megawatts (MW) of energy through 2004.
 
   Under the terms of the agreement which begins today, Dynegy and NRG's
 affiliates will provide 1,000 MW to DWR for the balance of 2001, and
beginning January 1, 2002 will provide up to 2,300 MW. Financial and other
terms of the transaction were not disclosed.
 
   "Since last summer, Dynegy and NRG have continued to produce all the
power the state has requested. We have worked diligently with the DWR to
capture the value of our in-state generation, balanced with California's
long-term energy needs," said Steve Bergstrom, president and chief operating
officer of Dynegy Inc.
 
   Craig A. Mataczynski, president and chief executive officer of NRG North
 America, said, "Today's announcement solidifies our commitment to
eliminating uncertainty for our respective shareholders and restoring price
stability and future reliability to the California electricity market."
 
   Dynegy Inc. is a leading provider of energy and communications solutions
to customers in North America, the United Kingdom and Continental Europe.
The company's leadership position extends across the entire convergence
value chain, from power generation and wholesale and direct commercial and
industrial marketing and trading of power, natural gas, coal emission
allowances, weather
 derivatives, and broadband to transportation, gathering and processing of
 natural gas liquids. For more information on Dynegy visit our web site at
 www.dynegy.com.
 
   NRG Energy is a leading global energy company primarily engaged in the
 acquisition, development, construction, ownership and operation of power
 generation facilities. NRG owns all or a portion of 66 power generation
projects
 and its net ownership interest in these projects is 16,704 MW. The
company's
 operations utilize such diverse fuel sources as natural gas, oil, coal and
coal
 seam methane, biomass, landfill gas, and hydro, as well as refuse-derived
fuel.

actual
 future results may vary materially from those expressed or implied in any
 forward-looking statements. Some of the key factors that could cause actual
 results to vary from those Dynegy and NRG expect include changes in

 conditions; the effectiveness of Dynegy's and NRG's risk management
policies and
 procedures; the liquidity and competitiveness of wholesale trading markets

 energy commodities, including the impact of electronic or online trading in
 these markets; operational factors affecting Dynegy's and NRG's power
generation

HEADLINE: California contracts for power at a lot less
 
BYLINE: BLOOMBERG
 
DATELINE: LOS ANGELES
 
BODY:
 
   LOS ANGELES (Bloomberg) - California Gov.  Gray Davis said the state
agreed
 to buy electricity from more than 20 suppliers over 10 years at an average
price
 of $69 per megawatt-hour, less than half the average price utilities paid
last
 year.
 
   California's Department of Water Resources will buy as much as 8,886
 megawatts, enough to light about 9 million homes, under contracts ranging
from
 four months to 20 years.  The suppliers include Enron Corp., Calpine Corp.,
Duke
 Energy Corp., Williams Cos Inc., Dynegy Inc.  and Reliant Energy.
 
   California's two biggest electric utilities, PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas &
 Electric and Edison International's Southern California Edison, owe more
than $
 12 billion to power generators and can't buy more.  The utilities have been
 paying more for power than California regulators allow them to charge
consumers.
 The state is buying power on behalf of the utilities.
 
   "These agreements are the bedrock of our long-term energy policy," Mr.
Davis
 told reporters in Los Angeles.  He expects the price of electricity in the
 contracts will prevent the need for further rate increases.
 
   Prices are higher in the first five years, averaging $79 a megawatt-hour,
 then fall to $61 in the past five years, Mr.  Davis said. The state also
signed
 11 short-term contracts last month to reduce purchases made in day-ahead
markets
 to an average of $228 a megawatt-hour, down from $330.
 
   In 2000, the price that California's three biggest utilities paid for
power
 averaged $120 a megawatt-hour, and reached a high of $1,500 on Dec. 12.
 
   The long-term contracts will supply about 75 percent of the power that
 utilities have been unable to purchase for their customers, Mr.  Davis
said.
 That's only about one quarter of California's consumption.
 
   "This is not a done deal.  We have additional deals that are being put to
 bed," said Davis negotiator David Freeman, general manager of the Los
Angeles
 Department of Water & Power.  The state expects to purchase another 2,000
 megawatts in contracts that are still being worked out, Mr.  Freeman said.
 
   Still, some generators have been unwilling to supply the state power
needed
 to avert blackouts this summer because of other contract obligations and
high
 natural gas prices.
 
   Earlier yesterday, Duke said it tentatively agreed to sell about $4
billion
 in electricity to California from 2002 to 2010, which would guarantee power
to
 the state after repeated shortages and emergencies this year.
 
   Calpine Corp.  agreed last week to supply 1,500 megawatts of power to the
DWR
 in 10-year and 20-year contracts valued at as much as $8.3 billion. Calpine
and
 Duke refused to sell the state power this summer because the supplies
already
 have been sold.
 
   "There are about 7,000 megawatts for this summer and deals are still in
the
 works," Mr.  Freeman said.

ENERGY UPDATE/Los Angeles Department of Water and Power Daily Energy Update
for Tuesday, March 6, 2001

Business Wire

(Copyright , 2001, Business Wire)

LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 6, 2001--Los Angeles Department of Water
and Power Daily Energy Update for Tuesday, March 6, 2001:



-- The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) continues to
   provide power to our native load customers and surplus energy to
   California. Yesterday, DWP provided between 75 Megawatts (MW) and
   125 MW for a three-hour period to the state through the
   California Energy Resource Scheduling unit.

-- DWP forecasts a peak energy load today in Los Angeles of 3,500 MW.

-- DWP has up to 100 MW of energy available today for sale.

-- This energy will be available to California entities to assist
   them in meeting their normal and emergency energy needs. No power
   will be sold outside of the state during any DOE-certified or ISO
   staged emergency.

-- DWP has 24 major thermal generating units at eight facilities.
   Today, fifteen units are operating including eight of ten base
   load units. Of the nine units not operating, three units have
   scheduled major maintenance activities underway; five units are
   undergoing minor maintenance; and the remaining unit is available
   for use, as the market requires. Hydro resources and pumped
   storage facilities can also be used to meet market demands.

-- The rolling blackouts from power shortages that have occurred in
   other parts of California will not be felt by DWP customers.

-- While electric rates have increased for some utilities in
   California, Los Angeles City residents continue to enjoy stable
   rates that have remained unchanged for nine years. DWP provides
   electricity and water to the city's 3.8 million residents.
