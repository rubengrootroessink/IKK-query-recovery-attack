Officials criticize energy report

California's energy crisis is expected to increase unemployment, reduce 
production and aggravate an already weakening economy, according to 
researchers at the University of California-Los Angeles. 
The impact, however, will likely depend on how state officials choose to deal 
with the failed deregulation scheme. The authors of the report released 
Thursday come down heavily in favor of lifting price controls and 
dramatically increasing the price consumers pay as a way to reduce the 
economic fallout. 
``California's economy is sufficiently large and dynamic that it will weather 
the current power crisis without being derailed,'' the report says. 
``However, our analysis reveals that this impact can be moderated by an 
approach that does not shift today's problems to tomorrow.'' 
The study, ``Short Circuit: Will the California Energy Crisis Derail the 
State's Economy,'' came under fierce criticism from Gov. Gray Davis' office. 
Steven Maviglio, Davis' spokesman, said many of the assumptions used to 
produce the report are either outdated or flat wrong. 
``It deserves its rightful place sitting on the shelf gathering dust,'' 
Maviglio said. ``Like any crystal-ball report, it's essentially irrelevant.'' 
Edward Lamer, a UCLA professor, and Christopher Thornberg, a visiting 
professor at UCLA, collaborated on the report with a team of researchers from 
the Cambridge Energy Research Associates. 
The study concludes that California's gross state product will be cut by 
anywhere from .7 percent to 1.5 percent in 2001 as a result of the energy 
crisis. In addition, energy problems will increase unemployment by .5 percent 
in 2001 and 1.1 percent in 2002. The report predicts consumers can expect 112 
hours of rolling blackouts this year. 
However, the report argues that the impact could be dramatically reduced if 
the state would raise the price consumers pay for energy to match the 
wholesale costs. This could reduce blackouts to 12 hours, lower the debt and 
interest the state will have to pay for electricity and encourage investment 
in the state to increase energy supplies. 
But Peter Navarro, a management professor at the University of 
California-Irvine, was skeptical of the report's findings. He said it was 
almost impossible to build models complex enough to take into account all the 
factors that affect energy prices in the state. 
In addition, he said the report seems to assume that there is no manipulation 
of the current market, which Navarro argues could be distorting prices as 
well. 
``How do you justify raising retail rates to 45 cents for power that costs a 
nickel to generate when there is some evidence that the market is flawed?'' 
Navarro said. ``This report seems to have an industry point of view and an 
industry agenda.''
