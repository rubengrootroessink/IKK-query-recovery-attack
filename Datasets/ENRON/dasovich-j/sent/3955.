Could you forward along to the EES folks we talked to yesterday who're 
interested in ISO's demand-side proposal.  Thanks.

Best,

Market Participants,

Attached is the California ISO's revised third RFB for Loads with
emergency back-up generators that wish to participate in the ISO Demand
Relief Program (DRP).  The ISO would especially like to thank the
participants that submitted bids that included back-up generators into the
first DRP RFB and encourages those participants to submit bids for this
revised RFB.

As mentioned in the March 30 Market Notice for the second DRP RFB (for
Loads not using back-up generators), the design of the back-up generator
program has changed somewhat since the issuance of the first DRP RFB.
Loads using back-up generators will still be dispatched after the DRP Load
blocks but will be available for 24 hours per month, similar to the Load
portion.  Successful bidders will start in the program either June 1 or
July 1 depending on how quickly contracts and logistics can be finalized.

Bids are due to the ISO on May 1 in accordance with the attached RFB.

This RFB will also be posted on the ISO Home Page (www.caiso.com) in the
next 24 hours.
