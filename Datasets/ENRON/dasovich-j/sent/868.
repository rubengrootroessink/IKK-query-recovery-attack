I've tried to capture in the document Dave sent around on Friday, the 
preliminary conclusions/directions we came up with in today's meeting.  If 
I've mangled or missed anything, please chime in.  If folks have information 
(i.e., bullet points) to discuss at Wednesday's meeting regarding the various 
issue areas they're thinking about, please foward along to me by COB tomorrow 
and I'll compile for distribution first thing Wednesday morning.

Best,
Jeff
