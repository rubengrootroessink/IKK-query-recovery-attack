Please be advised that Sue and Mona both have now been migrated to "Corp" and 
therefore, any e-mail sent to them should read "Susan J Mara/NA/Enron" and 
"Mona L Petrochko/NA/Enron", respectively.  

Please also note that anything addressed to their old "EES" addresses will 
NOT reach the addressee!

Thanks,
Joseph
