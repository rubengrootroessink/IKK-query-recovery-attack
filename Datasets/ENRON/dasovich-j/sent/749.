Hi Lee:

Looks great.  Could you do me a favor?  You have "generating company" rep on 
the agenda.  Enron does not see itself as a generating company.  In fact, the 
only generation that we own in California is 50+ MWs of wind power in 
Southern California.  Could you change it to "energy service provider" rep?  
Hope that's not a problem.

Best,
Jeff
