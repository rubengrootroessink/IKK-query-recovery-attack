Never mentioned the CFO.  Let's discuss further.  I can get you in.

Jeff,

My memory is failing me but I remember you telling me that you had a high 
placed contact at Sempra that you could contact to set up a meeting.

Don't let me down man.  I thought you told me it was the CFO.  Who is your 
contact?

Laird
