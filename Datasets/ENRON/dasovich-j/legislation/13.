Some bills worth noting:

SB 1460 (Kelley) - This bill would provide that an electrical
cooperative may become a member or stockholder of any other electrical
cooperative.

SB 1408 (Alarcon) This bill would enact the Environmental Justice
Technical Assistance Grant Demonstration Program.  The bill would
require the Office of Planning and Research to allocate grants in
amounts up to $25,000 to community-based nonprofit organizations in
communities with low-income populations or minority populations to
obtain technical assistance in connection with the organization's
participation in a decision to issue a permit by any board, department,
or office within the California Environmental Protection Agency, or in a
decision to issue a permit by the State Energy Resources Conservation
and Development Commission.
