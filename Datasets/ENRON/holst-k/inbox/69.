NEWS RELEASE

CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION

Energy Commission Staff Completes
Assessment of Henrietta Power Project


Sacramento -- The California Energy Commission staff has
released its Staff Assessment outlining the conditions that
should apply to the design, construction, operation and
closure of the proposed Henrietta Peaker Power Plant if the
Commission approves the project. The Staff Assessment can be
viewed on the Energy Commission's website at:

www.energy.ca.gov/sitingcases/henrietta/documents/


The document includes the Energy Commission staff's
comprehensive analyses of the 91.4-megawatt, simple-cycle
power plant proposed by GWF Energy, LLC. The facility is
planned for a seven-acre site near Lemoore in unincorporated
Kings County.

The project would consist of the power plant, a 70-kilovolt
switchyard, and approximately 550 feet of new transmission
line. Natural gas for the project will be delivered through
approximately 2.2 miles of new pipeline.

The Staff Assessment is a staff document, not a Commission
decision. This assessment was prepared by Commission staff
in accordance with the Public Resources Code and the
California Environmental Quality Act.

The Commission will hold a Prehearing Conference on Friday,
January 4, 2002, at the Energy Commission in Sacramento. If
the Committee determines that all potential issues are
uncontested, the Committee will convene an Evidentiary
Hearing immediately following the Prehearing Conference. If
any matter is contested, the Committee will hold an
Evidentiary Hearing on January 17, 2002.

The purpose of these open and publicly noticed meetings is
to allow members of the public to participate in the power
plant certification process. To find out how to get
involved, contact the Energy Commission's Public Adviser,
Roberta Mendonca, at (916) 654-4489, toll free at (800)
822-6228, or by e-mail at [pao@energy.state.ca.us].
