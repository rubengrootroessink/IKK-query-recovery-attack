Keith:  I am attaching the L1 visa questionnaire for you to complete.

In reference to your questions:

6.	Leave blank as you do not have a US Alien no.
7.	Answer N/A
11.	Leave this blank.  Only applicable for first L1 visas.
	Same with position abroad - leave blank.

However, I will need copies of the following information:

a copy of your passport
a copy of your current I-94 card (be sure that the red stamp shows clearly the date of last entry into the US)
an updated resume with months and years 
a job description for your current position
copies of dependent member's passports and I-94 cards.

Please call me early next week to set up an appointment to meet with me at x51529.  I will be on vacation tomorrow.

Thanks
Margaret

Margaret,

I do wish to renew my visa, however, the system has deleted your previous e-mail containing the questionnaire.  Could you please resend this and a list of other requirements.  I will turn the paper work around in 24 hours.

I am unsure how to respond to the following questions:

	6.   U.S. Alien registration number.....unsure what this is

	7.   Address outside U.S....................I have severed Canadian residency for tax purposes.  Can I answer N/A?

	11. Complete legal name and address of Enron affiliate......similar to #7.  I have severed all ties to Canada, including Enron Canada.

	Entire section on "Current postino abroad"....similar issue as described in #11.


Sorry for the inconvience this has caused.

Thanks
Keith

Keith:  I had sent to you on August 14, an email regarding the extension of your L1A visa. 

Please let me know if you wish to renew this before it expires on February 11, 2002?

If so, I will need you to complete the visa questionnaire form I sent to you and return to me with the required documents.

Please advise soonest.
Thanks
