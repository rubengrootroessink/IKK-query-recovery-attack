7. TOP 10 HOLIDAY TRAVEL TIPS

Heading to the airport? Being prepared will help your travel go
much more smoothly. Here are three of our top 10 tips on how to
pack, what to bring to the airport, and what to expect there. 

1. Before you leave home, check your airline's website. Continental,
   Delta, and United have provided airport operating hours and
   estimated security wait times, and Northwest and Delta are
   offering online check-in for selected customers.

2. Ship any wrapped gifts before you fly. If you have to bring
   gifts with you, leave them unwrapped, even if you plan to
   check your bags.

3. If you have elite status with your airline, find out if you're
   eligible for priority checkpoint lanes at the airport you're
   departing from. This service is available in select cities for
   elite fliers on American, America West, Northwest, and United.

8. TRAVEL ALERT: PRESIDENTIAL EMERGENCY BOARD DELAYS POTENTIAL
   UNITED STRIKE UNTIL FEBRUARY

As expected, President Bush today appointed an emergency board to
help resolve the nearly two-year-old dispute between United and its
mechanics' union. The move automatically delays a possible strike
or lockout for at least 60 days, meaning that United's service will
continue uninterrupted during the busy holiday travel period.

use up all their vacation time, reports Anita Dunham-Potter. 
Find out why giving vacation time back to your employer will
cost you money and could affect your health.
