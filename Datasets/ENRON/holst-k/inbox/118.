II. TRAVEL INFORMATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

5. TRAVEL TIP: RESOLVE TO EARN MILES IN 2002

Make your New Year's resolution to enroll in your favorite airline's
frequent flier program the next time you travel. Not earning miles
when you fly is like keeping your money under a mattress instead
of in a savings account. Even though airlines have ended their double
miles promotions, earning your way to a free ticket takes very little
effort. Sign up for a credit card, take advantage of a bonus mile
offer or two, and you can earn a free ticket this year!

To learn about frequent flier programs, visit

6. TRAVEL ALERT: EURO TO REPLACE OLD CURRENCY BEGINNING JANUARY 1

Twelve European countries will ring in the New Year by beginning to
circulate the euro, a shared currency now worth about 90 cents. Most
countries will gradually phase out their former currency by the end
of February. Travelers should expect longer than usual lines at
exchange locations during the transition, and are advised to use
credit cards whenever possible. Britain, Sweden, and Denmark are
the only European Union countries keeping their old currency.

IV. TRAVEL COLUMNS

10. TAXMAN IS PREFERRED OVER AIRLINES

By cutting back on amenities that make travelers more comfortable,
airlines are shooting themselves in the foot, according to Anita
Dunham-Potter. It's no wonder that customers say they prefer dealing
with the IRS to flying.

11. SMALL SAVINGS CAN ADD UP WHEN YOU TRAVEL
   
Sure, it's important to get a good deal on your airfare and hotel.
But don't overlook the smaller expenses of traveling that can easily
add up. Our Travel Tightwad, Christopher Elliott, explains how to
save on items like luggage carts, telephone calls, and room service.

12. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN AN AIRLINE ENDS SERVICE WITHOUT NOTICE?

Only a chance conversation prevented Mary G. from showing up for a
return flight that no longer existed. In this week's "Ask Anita,"
Anita Dunham-Potter finds out why Mary was never told about the
change, and suggests ways you can avoid a last-minute surprise.
