FOOD FOR THOUGHT - HOLIDAY ENTERTAINING

truffles and fudge, melt the chocolate in this heavy duty Double Boiler.

CAVIAR AND CHAMPAGNE

Ring in the New Year with the season's most luxurious food and drink. With 
its golden-sparkling bubbles, Champagne is one of the finest wines of the 
world! Before popping the cork, learn what makes this bubbly so special.

An elegant companion to Champagne is Caviar - opulent, refined, and worthy 
of your finest party. We've demystified this haute hors d'oeuvre so it's 
more approachable, especially if you've never eaten or served it. Discover 
its many types, how to buy and store it, and the many ways to serve.
