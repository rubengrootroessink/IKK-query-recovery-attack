Keith i would love to meet you for a beer but i am in massachusetts at the moment.  hopefully this head-hunter chick can set me up with some interviews in houston and we can meet up then.  As for your world tour, it really depends on how much you want to see.  You can take 3 months and rush through 20 countries and just see their main tourist sights, or you can take the same 3 months and see 4 countries really thouroughly and get a feel for a pleace's people, culture, way of life, economic system, food... all that jazz.  I can definately recommend some amazing places to you though.  I've taken 14 months and still haven't seen nearly everything i wanted to.  It's a big f-ing planet!
