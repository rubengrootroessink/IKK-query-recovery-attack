6. TOP 10 HOLIDAY TRAVEL TIPS

We can't make the planes run on time, and we can't control the
lines at the airport. But your holiday traveling can still be
smooth sailing if you follow these suggestions. Here are three
of our top 10 tips on how to pack, what to bring to the airport,
and what to expect when you get there. 

1. Arrive at the airport at least two hours before departure,
   and don't forget to confirm your flight times before leaving
   home. 

2. Bring a government-issued photo ID and a printout of your
   e-ticket receipt, if applicable. If you're not checking luggage,
   you'll be able to go directly to the security checkpoint.

3. Ship any wrapped gifts before you fly. If you have to bring
   gifts with you, leave them unwrapped, even if you plan to
   check your bags.
