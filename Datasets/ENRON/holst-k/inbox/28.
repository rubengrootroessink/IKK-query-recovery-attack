Hi Keith,
Just thought I would see if you are still with Enron, and lo and behold! there is your name.  I hope that all is going well for you.  I haven't looked closely, but I assume that you are still in Houston.  Do you like it?
All is well with me.  I'm living in Oxford, England, and am now working part time with a little company called Enron Direct.  The part time comes because I have a beautiful little 2 year old daughter, and she keeps me very busy.
Write back if you get a chance.
Crystal

ps  what is (little) Jon's last name?  Does he still work for Enron in Houston also?  Crystal
And I don't mean Lavorato!
