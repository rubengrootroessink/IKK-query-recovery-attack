Dear Keith,
 
It was a pleasure to meet you and your colleagues in gas / power trading last week.  I was very impressed by the quality of people that I met during my visit and remain interested in working for your organization.  Please find attached that report that I prepared for BC Gas on Weather Derivatives.  Unfortunately, I do not have the spreadsheets and the graphs on my hard drive.  
 
Enjoy your vacation in November (hopefully you'll be able to select a less rainy location that Vancouver).
 
I hope to hear from your team soon.
 
Sincerely,
 
Fred Baloutch
