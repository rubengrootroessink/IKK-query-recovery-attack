Neither Mike nor I have interviewed Scott before.  Our connection to Scott came through a very strong recommendation from our West-Power trading desk in Portland.  We are interested in Scott because his west power experience is directly related to the west gas market that Mike and I trade.

I don't mean to be a pain.  If this is unconventional, Mike and I will make seperate arrangements for Scott to meet with us.

Thanks
Keith

Karen,

Mike Grigsby and I would really appreciate being two of the interviewers of Scott on the 29th if that's not to difficult to arrange.

Thanks

Hi Keith,

Just spoke with Scott with regard to the trading track.  He has been scheduled to interview.

Kind regards,

Karen.
