We are really looking forward to having you on the team.  The new trading floor is awesome.  Feel free to take a couple extra days if you need them.

Keith,

I hope that you had a good time in London... Scotland was fantastic. I'm really glad that I got to go before I leave. Speaking of which, I received word from Karen Buckley that I'll be joining West Gas. I must admit, I'm pretty excited about it. I think that my start date will be December 5, although I haven't received any confirmation of that...

See you soon,

-Brent

Going to Scotland for the weekend....Why the hell are you moving back to Houston?  In 2 months you'll be going to Galveston for the weekend.  Anyway, I'm arriving early Friday morning and plan on reaching Enron around 1:00 PM.  If it works for you, lets plan on meeting around 1:30 PM.

Let's do it. The only time requirement I have on Friday is in the afternoon. I'm going to have to blow out of here around 4:00pm to catch a flight to Scotland for the weekend. The rest of day is open.

Looking forward to seeing you.

-Brent

Brent:

Phillip Allen passed your resume to me.  I would like to discuss the possibilty of you spending your first rotation in Houston with Mike Grigsby and myself on the west natural gas trading desk.  I understand that you are a trading candidate and a rotation on the west desk would fulfill one of the program requirements.  I will be in London November 9th, please let me know if you can spare a few minutes.

Thanks
Keith Holst
