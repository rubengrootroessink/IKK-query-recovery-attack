Tim,

We definitely appreciate any time that Steve is able to spare.  If you like, I will ask Mat coordinate his travel plans with Steve.  Also, if Steve made his rework documentation available, Mat would become familiar with it prior to his trip.

Keith,

The hitch here is that our demand expert, Steve Swain, is currently on emergency loan to the EES rehabilitation effort, and he's got a pretty tight schedule. I just talked to Steve, though, and he's willing to spend a day or two if we can accomodate his schedule. Also, he's put together some documentation on last year's major rework of the model that will probably make the time available sufficient to get a good understanding of what we're doing.

Tim,

Following our discussion in Portland, I reconfigured the structure of west gas fundamentals.  We will have a demand team, production team, and a gas transmission/storage team.  Mat Smith, whom you met last week in Portland, will attack demand and will be joined by an individual from the research group.

Since power consumption is a key driver of gas demand, I have two requests: (1) Will you allow us to use your load forecasts as variables into our gas demand models?;  (2) If you are alright with this, would you mind if Mat traveled to Portland and spent a couple days with your demand person to become more familiar with your process and assumptions?  Mat has been with Enron for about one year and holds a masters in engineering from MIT.  He has a firm grasp on our business and general mathematics and I am confident that he is able to learn quickly.  As far as security is concerned, Mat is bound by a standard Enron non-compete/confidentiality agreement.

Thanks again for your help.
