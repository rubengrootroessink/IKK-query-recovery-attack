Mike and Keith,
 
I am accepting the position with the West Trading Desk.  I am excited about the opportunity and look forward to starting on the desk soon.  I will discuss the timing of my departure with Ed Smida, but expect the rotation will within the week.  
 
Shelly, we need to complete the "back-office" changes as soon as possible.  Let me know what I need to do to help.
 
Thank you all very much for the opportunity.
 
Zac

Mike, 

I spoke with Andrea and Shelly from the A/A office and they informed me that there are currently positions available within West Gas Trading.  I am interested in the opportunity and would like to speak with you.  Please inform me on the current opportunities available and how you would like to proceed with this process in subsequent discussions.  You can contact me at x-57122.  

I have attached a resume for your reference. 

Thank you and I look forward to speaking with you.
