Keith:

This is what I am showing for our open exposure with enron in the western
region.  The positions represent your side...ie: you are net long perm basis
from us.  If you can scan your files to see who we could all wash with to
reduce net exposure, I would appreciate it.
Please give me a buzz in the morning.

Hope all is well with you.

Sai:

Plse take the spreadsheet below and cut out ELPerm/ELPSan
Juan/Norcan/Malor/Sobcal and put these into a separate spreadsheet.  I need
to send those points to Enron tonight with a disclaimer on the bottom so
that we can work on rolling out of risk.

thanks.
