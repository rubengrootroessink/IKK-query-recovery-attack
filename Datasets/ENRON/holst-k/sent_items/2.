Keith, I've just spoke with Mark, and he agrees with all this.   If you want to give me a call when you have a minute, I'll conference in Mark from Aron, and we'll just confirm all this.

Mark, 

I've been speaking with Enron and trying to get one person that we can talk to about all these trades. Keith Holst is set to go, and I'll send him this email once you agree with it.  Then we'll all get on the phone together.
