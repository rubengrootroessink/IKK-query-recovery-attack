Margaret,

I do wish to renew my visa, however, the system has deleted your previous e-mail containing the questionnaire.  Could you please resend this and a list of other requirements.  I will turn the paper work around in 24 hours.

I am unsure how to respond to the following questions:

	6.   U.S. Alien registration number.....unsure what this is

	7.   Address outside U.S....................I have severed Canadian residency for tax purposes.  Can I answer N/A?

	11. Complete legal name and address of Enron affiliate......similar to #7.  I have severed all ties to Canada, including Enron Canada.

	Entire section on "Current postino abroad"....similar issue as described in #11.


Sorry for the inconvience this has caused.

Thanks
Keith

Keith:  I had sent to you on August 14, an email regarding the extension of your L1A visa. 

Please let me know if you wish to renew this before it expires on February 11, 2002?

If so, I will need you to complete the visa questionnaire form I sent to you and return to me with the required documents.

Please advise soonest.
Thanks
Margaret
