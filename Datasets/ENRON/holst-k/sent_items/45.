Going to Scotland for the weekend....Why the hell are you moving back to Houston?  In 2 months you'll be going to Galveston for the weekend.  Anyway, I'm arriving early Friday morning and plan on reaching Enron around 1:00 PM.  If it works for you, lets plan on meeting around 1:30 PM.

Let's do it. The only time requirement I have on Friday is in the afternoon. I'm going to have to blow out of here around 4:00pm to catch a flight to Scotland for the weekend. The rest of day is open.

Looking forward to seeing you.

Brent:

Phillip Allen passed your resume to me.  I would like to discuss the possibilty of you spending your first rotation in Houston with Mike Grigsby and myself on the west natural gas trading desk.  I understand that you are a trading candidate and a rotation on the west desk would fulfill one of the program requirements.  I will be in London November 9th, please let me know if you can spare a few minutes.

Thanks
