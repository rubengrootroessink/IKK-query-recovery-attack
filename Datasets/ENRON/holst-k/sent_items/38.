Sounds good.  I'll plan on arriving to the office just after lunch and follow your lead on the beers.

Keith,

If you would like to come in and see the office on the 9th I can sort that out no problem.
Scott was suggesting that you would be over, and that he would like to meet me with you at the same time.

Any interest in a few beers that night?

Andy,

Coincidentally, I will be visiting London November 9th-11th and thought I might visit Enron's offices.

I am unaware of Amerax's penetration into the UK energy markets, but they are among the top three in North America.  As far as brokers go, Scott does a good job.  He is straight forward and honest and consequently was getting the largest share of our business in the west.

If you are interested, I would be happy to introduce you to Scott during my trip.  My schedule is fairly flexible.

Keith

Hi guys,

We met last February when I was over in Houston and you kindly gave me some pointers as to how we in the UK can apply your experiences to the UK market.

I have had a call from Scott at Amerex saying he is moving to London to set up here.
He has said you would recommend him with a view to working our numbers here in Europe.

Would you be able to comment favourably or otherwise when you get a minute?

Many thanks

Andy
