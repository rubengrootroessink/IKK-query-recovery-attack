==> MOST VFR FLIGHTS TO RESUME IN 15 OF 30 ENHANCED CLASS B AREAS <==

Late Saturday night the FAA issued a notam permitting most VFR flight
operations in 15 of 30 enhanced Class B (ECB) airspace areas. The full
text of the notam is provided below. It is less restrictive than
originally thought, and permits VFR operations subject to the
following conditions:

--Aircraft flying inside ECB airspace must have an operating
transponder and squawk VFR code (1200).

--Aircraft without a transponder must obtain a waiver for each
flight from the air traffic control facility responsible for the
ECB airspace.

--Aircraft must monitor the "guard" frequency of 121.5 MHz
(if equipped) while flying within ECB airspace.

The notam will become effective at 1100Z (7 a.m. Eastern time) on
Monday, October 15, for Houston, Texas; Kansas City, Missouri;
Memphis, Tennessee; New Orleans, Louisiana; and St. Louis, Missouri.

On Tuesday, October 16, the following ECB airspaces will be opened
at 1100Z (7 a.m. Eastern time): Cleveland, Ohio; Dallas-Ft. Worth,
Texas; Honolulu, Hawaii; Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Phoenix, Arizona.

And on Wednesday, October 17, at 1100Z (7 a.m. Eastern time) the
following airspace will be opened to VFR operations: Charlotte,
North Carolina; Cincinnati, Ohio/Covington, Kentucky; Salt Lake City,
Utah; Seattle, Washington; and Tampa, Florida.

The notam will also ask pilots to operate their aircraft in a "normal"
manner, avoiding circling or loitering. The FAA continues to prohibit
news and traffic reporting flights, sightseeing operations, banner
towing, and airship/blimp operations inside enhanced Class B airspace.
AOPA is continuing to push for the restoration of these flight
operations.

Plans to open the remaining 15 ECB areas are under way, but no
timelines have been established yet. AOPA understands that security
at the airports inside these ECB areas will be key to the return of
VFR operations. Friday afternoon, senior AOPA staff attended a
meeting on groundside security that may eventually play a role in
the release of the second group of ECB areas. Andrew V. Cebula, AOPA
senior vice president of Government and Technical Affairs, discussed
with FAA security officials possible changes that would enable VFR
operations in those areas.

"We won't rest until the last VFR aircraft is flying," said AOPA
President Phil Boyer. "We know some things will change, but our goal
is to restore all general aviation operations to where we were before
the attack while maintaining reasonable levels of security."

The full text of Saturday night's notam is below. While this is an
official FDC notam, AOPA reminds pilots to check the latest notams
prior to any flight operations. In recent weeks, some notams have
been modified repeatedly or rescinded. AOPA will continue to post
updates promptly on AOPA Online ( http://www.aopa.org/ ).
