How will hundreds of Houston's young singles celebrate Christmas this holiday 
season? The SingleLife Christmas Party on Thursday, December 13th from 
8p.m. - Midnight will be the social event of the season. Single adults 
ages 18-34 are invited to enjoy the festivities as the Aerial Theatre in 
downtown Houston is filled with tinsel and cheer for this annual semi-formal 
event. Hors de oeuvres, music, merry people and incredible door prizes- 
promise to make this party a smash hit.  
Tickets are now available for only $25 until Dec.1st; $35 until Dec.13th 
and for $40 at the door. Get yours today at www.singlelife.org. 

Don't just settle for another boring office holiday party- go where there 
is life!
