The project status hearing is being held to review the status of proceeding, the timeliness of Applicant data submissions, and the schedule for the remainder of the Application for Certification proceeding.

EL Segundo Power II LLC (ESP II), is seeking approval to replace the existing El Segundo Generating Station (ESGS) Units 1 and 2 natural gas-fired, combined cycle electric generation facility. ESGS Units 3 and 4 located adjacent to Units 1 and 2 will not be modified by this project. The new facility is expected to generate 630-megawatts (MW) under nominal conditions. The project includes demolition and removal of the existing Units 1 and 2 and replacement with Units 5, 6, and 7 in the location previously occupied by Units 1 and 2.

The public is encouraged to participate and will have the opportunity to provide comments and ask questions during the hearing. Persons requiring information on how to participate in the Energy Commission's review of the proposed project should contact Roberta Mendonca, the Energy Commission's Public Adviser, at (916) 654-4489 or toll free in California at (800) 822-6228, or by e-mail at pao@energy.state.ca.us.
