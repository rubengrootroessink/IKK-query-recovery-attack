Here's the scoop on people doing unethical broker trades:

 

Frank and Matt are the only others that have done Socal broker trades since 09/01 (I quereied from 09/01 to current).  As for Janie, she hasn't done any Socal brokered deals since July, but she has done a few at other points.

Sorry if you were hoping for more, but this is it... from Sept.1 to Oct. 11.

I'll be in Kansas on Fri.
