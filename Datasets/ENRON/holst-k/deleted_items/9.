Community Calendar Announcement


October 26, 2001 

Dear Editor/Publisher: 

If your publication, radio or television station offers a calendar of community events, you may want to include news of
the following hearing. 

The Committe overseeing the Application for Certification for the proposed Valero Cogeneration Project will hold a
committee conference and evidentiary hearing as follows: 

                                       TUESDAY, OCTOBER 30, 2001
                                             Beginning at 3 p.m.
                                              Benicia City Hall
                                              Commission Room
                                              250 East L Street
                                              Benicia, California
                                            (Wheelchair Accessible)

The evidentiary hearing will begin after the committee conference and will establish the record on air quality issues
and discuss potential resolutions. The conference is being held so that the committee can receive comments on the
Revised Presiding Member's Proposed Decision, released on October 9, 2001. 

Valero Refining Co. has proposed a 102-megawatt power facility consisting of two combustion turbine generators
equipped with water injection. The Valero Cogeneration Project would be located at the existing Valero Benicia
refinery in Block 25. 

Members of the public and interested agencies are invited to participate in the meeting. Time will be reserved to allow
members of the public to comment. Those who wish further information about how to participate should contact
Roberta Mendonca, the Commission's Public Adviser, at (916) 654-4489, toll free in California at (800) 822-6228, or
