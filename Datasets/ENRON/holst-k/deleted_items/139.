Tracy -  Thanks for writing.  If you are happy that's all that matters. I
can see how you would perhaps make a connection between Keith purchasing a
house, and how it might relate to your relationship and future together.
However, I don't feel an apology is in order from Miguel or me.   After all,
my comments to you were really meant to be taken with the best of intentions
to help Keith, as a first time home buyer, who for months had previously
sought Miguel's advice and assistance.  I think if you reflect on the type
of person that I am, you will understand what I'm saying.  Also, if you
truly believe that a lost commission means more to us than our relationship
with you, I'm truly sorry for that.  Life presents many choices.  I will
always choose to love my family over material things. We are human beings
and people often see things differently . I also accept that as a fact of
life.

As always, if you need me, you can count on me to be there for you.  Life is
too short.  Learn, Grow and Move On.

Love,

Elaine

Elaine-

I am very bothered by our earlier conversation and your follow-up e-mail
about Keith's home purchase.  However, I have taken this time to gather my
thoughts before responding.  I feel the best way to convey my feelings are
through this note.  It seems the old adage of not mixing business with
family is becoming an important lesson out of all of this.

First of all, I am very sorry for the way things have worked out.  Keith had
full intentions of finding a home on the MLS that suited his needs and would
have benefited Miguel.  However, we had no way of knowing his friend would
be transferred to London and that he would be selling a home which met our
criteria.  Unfortunately, the seller listed the home privately and was not
willing to use realtors.  Therefore, Keith was faced with a difficult
decision: Pass up a great house at a fair price, or keep looking!

Our conversation has left me feeling that you believe Keith wrongfully
shorted Miguel out of a commission that he had already earned.  I feel this
is an unfair attitude.  Keith did not go behind Miguel's back to negotiate
with someone who was selling a listed home nor did he break an agreement
with Miguel.  Keith truly appreciates the time Miguel spent with us on
several occasions, but he simply found a privately listed house.  It is my
understanding that this is a risk in real estate.  It is not uncommon for a
realtor to spend time with a client who decides either to not buy at all or
finds a privately listed home.  Unfortunately, this is the nature of real
estate and I do not see why Keith should be held to a different standard
because he is like family.

Secondly, I was not only upset by the content of our conversation, but also
the manner in which you acted.  You insisted that Miguel needed to represent
Keith to determine the FMV and then went on to say that it was up to us if
we decide to pay more than the house is worth.  I was bothered by your
insinuation that we are unable to, "act in an orderly and professional
manner", and that we are incapable of making a sound investment decision.

I have milled this over in my head a million times trying to understand
where you might be coming from.  While I understand some disappointment at
the loss of a commission, I cannot appreciate the reasons I've imagined you
might have for being upset.  Keith appreciates Miguel's efforts and wishes
things had worked out more favorably for him.  Keith acted in good faith by
offering Miguel the opportunity to facilitate the closing.  He did
understand Miguel's decision to not take part.  However, it came down to the
fact that he had to go with the home that was best for him.

Elaine, I am so sorry if all of this has in any way damaged our
relationships but let me reiterate the fact that Keith and I made this
decision together.  He is someone who is very important to me and in the not
so distant future when we ultimately tie the knot this will be our home
together.  I thought that it was the best decision at the time and I still
feel that it was a good move for him to buy the place.  However, I am
concerned and saddened by what has occurred between all of us.

I hope you know how important both you and Lauren are to me.  You have been
like a big sister. Living in Houston the past five years and getting to be a
part of your lives has been so important to me.  I have treasured getting to
share in your joy of meeting Miguel and having the opportunity for Keith to
get to know all of you as well.  I hope that you know that I would be there
for you and Lauren in a heartbeat.  I just want you to know how I feel about
all that has happened in the past few weeks and I feel that if I call you I
will not get the chance to say all that I am thinking.  I am sorry if you
are upset with the situation and I hope that all four of us will be able to
move on and repair any damage done to our relationship.  I do love you and
Lauren very much.

Tracy
