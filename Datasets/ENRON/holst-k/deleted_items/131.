10. TRAVEL CONSUMERS' GUIDE TO BANKRUPTCY
    by Anita Dunham-Potter, Contributing Travel Editor

unclear just how many airlines, cruise lines, and hotels will still
be standing when all is said and done. Whatever the outcome, travel
consumers will become painfully aware of a term called bankruptcy.

11. BEST BARGAINS ARE IN THE CARDS--BUT WHICH ONE?
    by Christopher Elliott
   
Reservations agents at hotels, car rental companies, and tour
operators don't always ask if you belong to a club or organization
that may entitle you to save money. It's a little bit like playing
poker. You have to know which cards to leave on the table and which
ones to keep in your pocket.

12. STRESS MANAGEMENT ON THE ROAD: BREATHE EASY AND STAY HEALTHY
    by Evelyn Hannon

certainly until they've reached a certain plateau of self-confidence
and familiarity with cultural "rules." Hopefully the following pieces
of advice will help you to lower your levels of stress as you travel.

13. HALLOWEEN HAUNTS, FAR AND WIDE
    by Lisa Turner

Halloween falls on a Wednesday this year, so you might have to pass
on that trip to Transylvania. But there are plenty of creepy, crawly
places just a rental car drive, train trip, or plane hop away that
will get you in a Halloween mood.
