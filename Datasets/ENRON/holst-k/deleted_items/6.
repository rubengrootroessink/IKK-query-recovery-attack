Hey there!  My head is still killing me! I just didn't think it was
appropriate for me to call in sick on my fourth day...

Tonight we need to go to my place and look online and decide what we want to
for Thanksgiving.  Where we want to go and where we could stay.  I want to
tell my dad something soon so he can decide.
