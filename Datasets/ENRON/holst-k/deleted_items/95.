Keith:  I made progress on the model.  All of the data pulls in from EOL and hedge strips.  The other pieces should go smoothly.  Unfortunately, I have class tomorrow starting at 8:30.  I will work on it in the morning and after class.

Take a look at what I have so far and let me know what you think.

Thanks

Anne
