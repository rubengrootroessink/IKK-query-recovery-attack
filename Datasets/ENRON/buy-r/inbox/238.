You are going to love this one!  From a friend in California.

Akhmed came to the United States from Afghanistan, and he
was only here a few months when he became very ill.  He went
to doctor after doctor, but none of them could help him.

Finally, he went to an Arab doctor.  The doctor said,
"Take dees bucket, go into de odder room, shit in de bucket,
piss on de shit, and den put  your head down over de bucket
and breathe in de fumes for ten minutes."

Akmed took the bucket, went into the other room, shit
in the  bucket, pissed on the shit, bent over and breathed
in the fumes for ten minutes.

Coming back to the doctor he said, "It worked. I feel
terrific!   What was it?"

The doctor said, "You were homesick."
