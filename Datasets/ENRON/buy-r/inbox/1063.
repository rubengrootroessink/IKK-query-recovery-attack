First.  Thanks for the VAR.
 
Second.  This is the only time I ever tried to get Vlady.  He actually works for Dave not me.

I can't believe you finally got Vlady. You must have snuck in while I was on vacation. 

By the way, Whalley, Port and I talked and decided we would try removing all your limits except var. Lets see how it works.
