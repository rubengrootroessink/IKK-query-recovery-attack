We will wait to you get back.  I had heard of your illness.  I hope you are recovering well.  You are not missing much here . . . just mass hysteria.

Rebekah - Please check with Rick's assistant to schedule a time to present our strategy to Dave Gorte, Randy Peterson, and Rick, as soon as he returns.

Rick, 

Our group has completed our new investment strategy and are preparing to move into the execution phase.  I would appreciate the opportunity to present the strategy to you, Dave Gorte and Randy Petersen.  It would take about 1 hour, and I would value your feedback.  Let me know if you are up for it, and I will have my assistant schedule it.

Thanks, 
KG
