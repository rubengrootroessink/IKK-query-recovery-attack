Once again this prestigious event will take place in Boston in June. The two-day conference will be on June, 11 & 12 with additional seminars taking place on the 10th & 13th. 

Four streams featuring leading industry practitioners and academics:

The Risk team will be undertaking intensive research over the next few months to fully update the conference programme, and to bring you the most cutting-edge information in a diverse range of topics.
