All

I would be grateful if you could prepare 2 lists of personnel for midday tomorrow which form an A list and B List and send them to me and Mark Evans. 

The A list should be the people in the your business unit who are absolutely essential, in the event of a winding up of EEL, to assist in the winding up of your commercial support unit over a short (say two week) period. The B list should include the A list but also include those people whom additionally you think would be ideal to retain to assist in this process. 

Many thanks

Sarah
