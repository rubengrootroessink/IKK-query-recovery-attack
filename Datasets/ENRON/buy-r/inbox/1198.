I attach the final version of the 8-K reflecting our last conversation
(concerning Gene's comments this morning), together with a blacklined
version from the document circulated by Sidley last evening.  I have not
reviewed the listing of exhibits to the 8-K, but presume they include
everything necessary.  If not, let us know.

I will shortly send you a version of the press release.

Marc
