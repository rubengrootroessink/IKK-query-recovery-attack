It is already time to begin preparation for another regular Board meeting on Tuesday, Feb. 12 with Committee meetings on the afternoon of Monday, Feb. 11.  We need to set the schedule this week in order for the members of the Board to get nonrefundable airfares.  By Thursday, please advise me of how much time you will need for the Committee meetings (or for your portion) on Feb. 11:

Audit			Andrew
Compensation		Mary
Finance			Rick 
			Ray

Thanks.  Paula
