One of my colleagues, Jon Cummings (a partner from McKinsey's Johannesburg
office), and his client team from Anglo American would like to visit with
certain individuals at Enron.  They would like to meet with each of you on
a "best practices visit" to the US.  They are trying to understand how
Enron manages corporate center structure and role, performance management,
and people proposition.

Anglo American is the global leader in mining and natural resources.  It
has significant interests in gold, platinum, diamonds, coal, base and
ferrous metals, industrial minerals, and forest products.  The group is
geographically located in Africa, Europe, South and North America, and
Australia.  They will be visiting several companies on this trip including
Johnson & Johnson, BP, and Emerson.

Would you be able to let us schedule an hour with you to meet with Jon
Cummings (Director, McKinsey), along with Philip Baum (COO, South Africa),
David Hathorne (MD, Mondi Europe) and several HR people?

My assistant, Carol Benter, will be in touch with your assistants to try to
schedule this meeting for July 16 or 17.  Please contact Carol Benter
(713/751-4378), or me (713/751-4390) if you have any questions about this
request and thank you for your time and consideration.
