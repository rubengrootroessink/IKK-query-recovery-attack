All,
          The Potential Exposure application and the Liquidity Risk application are now on the RAC web-site (http://rac.corp.enron.com).  The details are as follows:

(a) For Potential Exposure, Go to Credit Risk Reporting, then to Potential Exposure Simulation.

(b) For Liquidity Margin Exposure, Go to Liquidity Risk, then to Liquidity Margin Exposure.

Some additional changes have been incorporated to the version in the development stage:

(a) For Potential Exposure
Maximum Exposure amounts are currently displayed.
The first exposure is the Current Mark-to-Market.
There is flexibility in choosing a particular date.

(b) For Liquidity 
There is a breakdown of P-99 Enron Liquidity by counterparty.
Current Margins are also shown.
There is flexibility in choosing a particular date.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.  
Naveen
