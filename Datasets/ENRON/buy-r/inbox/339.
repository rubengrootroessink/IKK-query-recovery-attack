Subject:=0911/30 and 12/3 DPR - update as of 12/15/01

For the next few days, we will be reporting only positions, maturity gap, &=
 VAR for the DPR.  We expect to be reporting P&L for ENA again probably by =
the middle of next week.

The 11/30 DPR is still listed on the ERV as preliminary, as there are still=
 a couple small items outstanding.  The 12/3 and 12/4 DPRs should be out by=
 tomorrow.  We are currently experiencing some IT issues related to positio=
n reporting which have prevented the reporting of these days.  I expect the=
 issue to be resolved by the middle of the afternoon today and we will repo=
rt shortly thereafter.

If you have any questions, please call me at 713 853 9123.

Thank you,

Shona Wilson
