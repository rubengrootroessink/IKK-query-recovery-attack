With the U.S. dollar weaking over the last month vs. most major currencies, and forecasts for it to continue to do so, (which is clearly helpful to Enron while we try to sell international assets), I was wondering if we should think about selling some long dated (6 month-to 1 year depending on when we think we could actually sell something) OTC F/X or Euro calls.  (Or sell calls and buy puts with the proceeds.

Any thoughts?
