Rick, we haven't scheduled a time but I think Bob does intend to talk to everyone.  Michael is here to represent individuals in the SEC and congressional proceedings  (in your case probably as co-counsel to JC) while Bob is company counsel.  The purpose of the split representation is to preserve the privilege with respect to discussions you have with J.C. or Michael.

Bob Bennett, the Skadden Arps lawyer who has been retained by the Company to represent it in the Congressional Committees' investigations, will be here next Thursday and Friday, December 20-21, to meet with you about the interviews the staff attorney for the House Energy and Commerce has requested with you.  I will let you know the time and place.

Please call me with any questions.
