To those who do not have counsel (Ray, Greg, and Dave):

The company has retained Mike Levy with Swidler & Berlin to represent officers and employees subpoenaed in any of these investigations.  Mike will be in the office next week.  Please call me and I can set up a meeting (ext. 5-2402).  In addition, Bob Bennett and Carl Rauh with Skadden and Britt Davis with the Enron Litigation Unit will be working on responding to these subpoenas.

Thank you for your cooperation.
