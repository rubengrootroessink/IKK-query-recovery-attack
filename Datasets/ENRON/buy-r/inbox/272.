FYI
The curve - shift P&L information that is used in the VaR model for backtesting comes from the business units. Under the "garbage in, garbage out" rule we therefore have had some errors in the backtest data. However, the errors do not significantly affect the backtest result (i.e. it still backtests ok), but they do cast doubt on the P&L numbers that have been submitted.

John,

This file gives you similar information to the file that Jeff sent you for gas.  Frank is using it to continue investigating what went wrong with the extraction from the VaR model.  If you want me to change anything, let me know.

 

Thanks,
Stacey
