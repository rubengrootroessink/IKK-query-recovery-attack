Attached is a draft of the back-up presentation on the Mill performance for the Finance Committee meeting.  While we believe the numbers are correct, there may be some minor revisions.  These numbers are from acquision through August.  The effect of the Garden State newsprint and ONP swaps is included (energy excluded).  We have also not included any income booked on swaps related to the mills.  We can finalize Monday morning.  Let me know if you have any comments.

Ray
