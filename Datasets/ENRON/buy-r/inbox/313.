     James,
     
     As requested, attached please find a CRC due diligence list.  Please 
     note that we have asked one of our risk systems experts to come from 
     London to do on site work in Houston on Tuesday. I expect we will have 
     other members of our team down there as well.  We will contact CRO Buy 
     to arrange this on Monday, but you might tell the company as well.
     
     Thanks
     
     Glass
