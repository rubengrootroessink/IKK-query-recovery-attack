Working on the New Power deal really gets one thinking about the liquidity provisions in contracts (collateral posting provisions).   Given the emphasis on the swings in net cash/credit posted at a Enron Corp level, perhaps we should think of metric to measure the posting risk.   Contracts have different thresholds (or none at all) and the effect on our credit capacity is not always symetrical.

I was just thinking of the mountain of things going on, outside of normal stuff, and I decided to make a list. Here it is:

Formation of International Credit Group- Bradford/Murphy
Curve Validation Issue-Port/Gorte
Steel Issues-Bradford/Gorte
Rocar Progress/Implementation-Gorte
Operational Risk Metrics/Implementation-Curry
EES???-All
Bankruptcy Group-Gorte/Carson/Tribolet/Bradford
Retail Credit-Bradford/Carson
Private Equity Trading-Gorte
Credit Consistency study- Buy

I think we should have a meeting to discuss above. Some are bigger than others. Organization and website need to adapt to current business environment. 

If anything else belongs on this list let me know. Karen will set up meeting.
