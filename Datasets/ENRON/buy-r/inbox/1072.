They're in the mail!  Thanks to everyone in Portfolio for a great team effort in pulling together our most recent board package. Our Reporting Group led the charge by putting in some long hours and addressing numerous challenges including developing data with the Credit and Market Risk groups on new charts such as the Liquidity Ratio Analysis.  The Compliance group took on the entire responsiblility for the DASH book which freed up our Reporting Group to deal with some of the challenges noted above.  Due Diligence and PortRAC personnel worked on several important projects in connection with the presentations such as Foreign exchange.  Everyone helped with proofing and final assembly.  Again, thanks to all for a great job!!       Rick C.
