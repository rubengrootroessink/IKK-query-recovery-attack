Court would have to approve any reduction or significant change that we would do outside the normal course of business - short answer probably no on the non-compete otherwise we are down to 100 people have at it.

Took a call from Bill Cronin at New Power  today. He requested that they be able to deal with commercial customers that were off limits before, ie medium commercial or large commercial. He also mentioned that they may have an interesty in some of the people. Any thoughts?
