The EIU Country Reports on Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India are now available in our Resource Library.

To access the Resource Library: O:\RAC\RESOURCE LIBRARY\20 - Sovereign Investment Issues\India Pakistan Afghanistan Research

The library has been temporarily moved from the RAC website but will be available through the website later this week.


Thanks!
