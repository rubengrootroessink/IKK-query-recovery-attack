I do not know if you are looking for anyone right now in your group, but attached is the resume of a woman I used to work with at American General Corporation ("AGC").  She was an excellent business person.  I worked with her on private placement transactions.  One of the responsibilities of a private placement analyst at AGC was credit analysis.  If I can answer any questions about her let me know.  The only reason she is currently looking is because of the possible job losses following the acquisition of AGC by AIG.
