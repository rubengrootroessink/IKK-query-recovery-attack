Please let us know if you have anyone available. My understanding is if we have to got to the outside it will cost us $200 per hour, per person. We appreciate your support.

Regards,
Frank

	The Corporate Development group is in need of extra people (with some free time on their hands) to assist in manning 3 data rooms that are being set up for the
	potential sale of Enron Wind.  If you know of any employee who would be available, please let me know ASAP.   The employee does not have to be familiar with 
	the business, just capable of watching the area and ensuring that Enron's property is securely maintained.  The hours are 8am to 8pm and we are slotting
	people in based on their availability.  The data rooms are at the ENRON building, the Crowne Plaza Hotel and the Warwick Hotel.

	Thanks!
