Rick, thanks for taking so much of your time to explain RAC to the IPG group.  You said all the right things and left them with exactly the impression we were shooting for.  We are now trying to finalize a term sheet so we will be working with your folks to get this transaction down the road.  If I can return the favor let me know.  Thanks again.
