Below is the list of volunteers for all of the RAC sites.  I also have additional information on there.  Please give me a call tomorrow on my cell if you need me 832-725-1174.  The plan right now is for us to go regardless of weather.  However, I would leave it up to each individual to decide if they want to participate.  Let me know if you have any other questions.

Becky - you may want to send out one more reminder to your people.  You can copy all of the names from excel and paste into the TO: spot in Outlook.
