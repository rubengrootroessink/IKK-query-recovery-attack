Rick,

It was good running into you last week.  I am currently looking for new
opportunities.  In the last 18 months, I have been working on eCommerce,
specifically B2B exchanges and enterprise portals.  I understand that
Enron has several initiatives in this area.  I was hoping you could give
me some direction.  Attached is my resume.

Hope all is well,
