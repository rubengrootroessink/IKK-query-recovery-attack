Rick:  Good list.  As a subset of Bankruptcy Group we may want to add our efforts to foster development of consistent, accurate, Enron-wide accounts receivable aging information (Carson, Curry, Bradford).  Also, our approved 2002 budget, while allowing some limited headcount growth, may present challenges with everything on our plate.  We could discuss some potentially creative ways to lever our budget dollars.  Rick C.

I was just thinking of the mountain of things going on, outside of normal stuff, and I decided to make a list. Here it is:

Formation of International Credit Group- Bradford/Murphy
Curve Validation Issue-Port/Gorte
Steel Issues-Bradford/Gorte
Rocar Progress/Implementation-Gorte
Operational Risk Metrics/Implementation-Curry
EES???-All
Bankruptcy Group-Gorte/Carson/Tribolet/Bradford
Retail Credit-Bradford/Carson
Private Equity Trading-Gorte
Credit Consistency study- Buy

I think we should have a meeting to discuss above. Some are bigger than others. Organization and website need to adapt to current business environment. 

If anything else belongs on this list let me know. Karen will set up meeting.
