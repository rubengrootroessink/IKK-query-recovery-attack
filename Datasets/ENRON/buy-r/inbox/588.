1=09CEO but leave 3.0 and 1.5 thresholds - if we need to change we'll chang=
e and then BOD can ratify as with other policy changes - they will certainl=
y require some feedback on the metric.
2=09Numerator from Global Finance, not Accounting. FAC and BC as previously=
 defined
3=09I think the PFCR definition is adequate

If our position liquidity horizon is about 10 days it should be revised wee=
kly or when there is a big market move ("weekly or as markets dictate")

RAC should orchestrate the calculation, as a "prototype" which when bedded =
down and stable can be passed to GRMO

Ben/David/Bill -

Please see the what we have for the following policy excerpts at the end of=
 this message, and address the following:

1.=09Advisory Limit Setting - is it by the BOD or by the CEO?  Our presenta=
tion says CEO, but also specifies the trigger as 3.0 for P50 and 1.5 for P9=
9.  If it's CEO level, we don't need to specify in the policy what the trig=
ger limit is, as CEO can change.  If it's in the Policy itself, it's consid=
ered a Board approved limit.=20
a.=09Let's decide - if CEO level, let's change to say "a certain multiple o=
f..." instead of 3.0 and 1.5
b.=09If at Board level,  don't we need to specify a time horizon? If not, w=
hy bother to specify the trigger - if one's going to be at CEO discretion a=
nd consequently not specified in the policy itself, why not all of it?

2.=09Definitions in 3.4 excerpt below - Rick Buy wants these definitions ha=
rd coded and clearly defined in the policy

?=09Future Available Cash -=20
?=09Is this straight off a daily report from Accounting?  What does this # =
represent and what do we want in the policy?
?=09which individual is going to provide this daily, and when? =20
?=09Borrowing Capacity -=20
?=09I defined this by pulling terms straight from the slide in the Joint Au=
dit/Finance Committee presentation - do you agree?
?=09who is going to calculate this daily and provide to RAC, and by when?
?=09Potential Future Cash Requirements -
?=09is this clear enough?  any specific collateral assumptions given contra=
ctual cash posting optionality?  worst case assumption?

3.=09Does RAC really need to calculate this if GRMO is going to report it o=
n the Executive Report Viewer, and the calculations are hard-coded above?  =
Seems like we could implement a process by which the 3 pieces of informatio=
n get fed to GRMO to calculate and report, like all the other market risk m=
etrics.

Please call me in the morning so I can run through any required changes.

Regards,
Cassandra.


3.4=09Risk Measurement for Liquidity/Funding Risk
Liquidity/funding risk focuses on whether the Company is able to raise enou=
gh capital (whether through debt, equity, or counterparty collateral) to me=
et its cash and collateral requirements, and is a function of funding liqui=
dity and position liquidity.  Margin deposits received and margin deposits =
required under the Company's Trading Portfolio have a significant impact on=
 the Company's funding requirements, and are often determined by changes in=
 commodity prices.  Position liquidity refers to the extent to which a posi=
tion can be liquidated quickly, and in large volume, without substantially =
affecting the position's price.  Key determinants of the liquidity of a pos=
ition and the cost of liquidation include: (a) the level of third-party int=
erest and market activity in the asset, (b) the time period available to co=
nvert the asset to cash, (c) the size (value or volumes) of the asset, and =
(d) perception of the Company in the marketplace.  Active management of fun=
ding requirements and capital availability should minimize funding shortfal=
ls.  See Section 4.4 for the limit structure and reporting guidelines.
The Liquidity Exposure Ratio ("Liquidity Ratio") is the primary metric of t=
he Company's liquidity/funding risk to be implemented under a transition pe=
riod determined by the Risk Management Committee.  The Liquidity Ratio shal=
l be calculated daily over a specified time period by dividing (a) the sum =
of the Company's (i) Future Available Cash and (ii) Borrowing Capacity, by =
(b) the Company's Potential Future Cash Requirements.  Future Available Cas=
h shall represent the Company's current cash-flow forecast as determined by=
 the Accounting department, considering operating and investing activities.=
  Borrowing Capacity shall be determined by the Treasury department, and sh=
all be calculated as the sum of: (a) commercial paper; (b) uncommitted bank=
 lines and loan sales lines; (c) letter of credit facilities; (d) accounts =
receivable; (e) shelf registrations for public debt issues; and (f) shelf r=
egistrations for public equity issues.  Potential Future Cash Requirements =
shall be calculated by the Trading Portfolio's risk systems and shall repre=
sent a simulation of margin exposure and collateral requirements for the Tr=
ading Portfolio.
Liquidity stress testing shall be performed periodically, as determined by =
the Chief Risk Officer, to quantify the liquidity/funding risks associated =
with specific positions.  Such stress testing may include specific asset li=
quidity stress tests to quantify the risks associated with illiquid positio=
ns.  Results of liquidity stress testing will be made available to the CEO =
and to other parties at the discretion of the Chief Risk Officer.

4.4=09Capital Associated with Liquidity/Funding Risk
Liquidity/funding risk arises from the potential that funding requirements =
will exceed funding availability for a given time period.  Funding requirem=
ents may vary over time as a result of: (a) exchange margin requirements, c=
ollateral obligations and collateral receivables primarily related to Tradi=
ng Portfolio activities; (b) new investments; (c) the payment of interest a=
nd dividends; and (d) the maturing of debt and other obligations.  Funding =
availability may vary over time as a result of: (a) available cash; (b) acc=
ess to capital markets; (c) available collateral; and (d) the time required=
 to convert positions to cash or liquid assets.
The Company shall use the Liquidity Ratio, liquidity stress testing and oth=
er methods as specified by the Chief Risk Officer to measure liquidity/fund=
ing risk.
4.4.1=09Limit Structure for Liquidity/Funding Risk
The CEO shall approve an advisory limit for liquidity/funding risk ("Liquid=
ity Ratio Advisory") to be implemented under a transition period approved b=
y the Risk Management Committee.  This shall be based on the Liquidity Rati=
o discussed in Section 3.4 of this Policy.  The Liquidity Ratio shall be ca=
lculated using two different assumptions to calculate Potential Future Cash=
 Requirements, the denominator of the calculation: (a) a 50% confidence lev=
el, and (b) a 99% confidence level.
4.4.2=09Administration/Reporting for Liquidity/Funding Risk
The Liquidity Ratio shall be calculated on a daily basis and reported by GR=
MO to the CEO, the Chief Risk Officer, and the Treasury department designee=
.  If the Liquidity Ratio is (a) less than 3.0 using a 50% confidence level=
 to calculate Potential Future Cash Requirements or (b) less than 1.5 using=
 a 99% confidence level to calculate Potential Future Cash Requirements, th=
e Chief Risk Officer shall notify the CEO and others at his discretion.  Th=
e CEO shall direct senior management to take certain actions to mitigate th=
e Company's liquidity/funding risk.
