CONFIDENTIAL NOTE TO RICK & DAVE:  Do either of you have a clear understand=
ing of Corporate Development's mission in regard to the development of this=
 database to assist in the divestiture of certain of the merchant investmen=
ts?  A few weeks ago we met with Sherron to show her PortRAC which she want=
ed to use along with some livelink files to assist them in divestiture acti=
vity.  Her final vision as portrayed by the attached presentation has turne=
d into a large database which will take lots of resources to develop and ma=
intain which she has indicated by her memo should be supported by my group.=
  Also, it seems redundant with RAC's existing data plus a lot information =
that is maintained by the business units such as Kevin Garland's group.  I =
am comfortable that we can respond to any data request as well as build a d=
ata room if necessary for a big sale/syndication with our our existing data=
 and our newest tools (PortRAC, COMET, RAC Website,  DASH Library, etc.) wi=
thout creating another database.  Since Sherron has left the group, do you =
think that this new database is her idea alone or is it also embraced by Do=
nahue? =20

Concerns aside, if you think that this new database is necessary, we are ce=
rtainly capable of supporting it.  Please let me know your thoughts.

=09In August we were discussing the additional information needs that Corpo=
rate Development has re: an electronic repository for the original models, =
pitch books, research, etc. on assets/deals, plus any current work Corporat=
e Development, the business unit or RAC may have done.  Some of the informa=
tion Corp Dev was interested in was financial data for each asset (EBITDA, =
NI, debt, etc.) that I think could be added to the PortRac system.  The rem=
ainder of the data Corp Dev was looking to have on hand electronically was =
to be part of a new livelink application that Cornelio was going to help de=
velop.  The attached ppt file describes the user needs for this development=
 project. =20

The question is - Who is the new business unit sponsor since I've left the =
group?  The information is not dissimilar to what RAC/Underwriting maintain=
, plus RAC/Underwriting have the right staff to maintain the livelink appli=
cation.  It's just a matter of getting the right approvals for this additio=
nal work load to be budgeted for Rick Carson's group and also having the gr=
oup meet with various Corp Dev folks (use the ppt file attached) to establi=
sh the support relationship.  Please call if you need anything further.  Sh=

Sherron,

It's been a while since we had our last meeting. I would like to follow-up =
with you regarding the Asset Library. I would like to find out if you are s=
till interested in pursuing this project. We left off on issues surrounding=
 RAC and integrating your operations with them. I have not been aware of an=
y decisions regarding this, as well as direction that you wish to go. I loo=
k forward to hearing from you. Thanks.


Cornelio
