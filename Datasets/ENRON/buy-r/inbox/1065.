Cash Recoveries take 6 to 12 months after the audit is performed.   The 2001 cash recovery is a small amount of the remainder to be collected ($475,283 claims vs $43,913 collected).  The balance will be collected in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of 2002. The 2000 amount ($315,579) is cash received in 2001 from audits performed in 2000.
