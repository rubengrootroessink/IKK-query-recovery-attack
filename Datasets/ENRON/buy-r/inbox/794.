Dear Richard ,

At the outset let me introduce myself.  My name is Prameesh Barlota  and I
represent Atos Origin. 

Atos Origin, a leading global information technology services provider,
helps clients turn their vision into results through the effective use of
E-business solutions and IT. With sales of more than $ 2.5 billion in 2000,

Atos Origin currently operates in more than 30 countries worldwide and has
more then 27,000 employees. Its customers include ABN-Amro, Akzo-Nobel,
Aramco, BNP Paribas, Cegetel, Vivendi, Credit Lyonnais, Euronext, Fiat, ICI,
Lucent Technologies, Philip Morris, Philips, Unilever and Wolters Flower.
For more information, visit the company's website at
(http://www.atosorigin.com).

Having worked with many global customers, we are aware of the business
issues faced by an organization like Enron Corp - from the software
development and maintenance and product support point of view.  

We at Atos Origin are structured as Competence Centers around products like
SAP, Baan, JD Edwards, QAD, Siebel, Oracle, I2, which provides
Implementation services, as well as support services.

We have global delivery model which combines local resources along with
resources in cost effective economies around the world like India, China,
Hungry etc. We have centres in CA, Dallax, Cincinnati in North America and
Toronto in Canada. The man power in these centres are more than 2500
Software Professionals.

India based Global Software Engineering facility provides full range of IT
services encompassing entire lifecycle. This mechanism, called Software
Factory, allows us to build a full service delivery compatible with your
technical, functional and cultural needs.

The mechanism of the "Software Factory" can offer the following benefits to
Enron Corp :
-Free - up critical internal resources for strategic projects  
-Visible, predictable and controlled life cycle costs and risk management
-Guaranteed quality, efficiency and standardization of the development
process (ISO  & CMM Level 5). 
-Pre-agreed deliverables and service levels, measured performance using
balanced scorecard.
-Creative business models and contracts, covering various risks and
performance sharing based service level agreements.	
-Minimize fixed costs / investment. Reduce development and life-cycle costs.


We expect to offer at least 30% cost savings (over using local US resources)
by using our Global Software Engineering Factory. I can provide you concrete
data regarding the benefits that our customers have got by working with our
Software Factory.

Atos Origin would be able to set up a custom-built service delivery
mechanism to extend your own software capabilities: right from maintenance
and support of legacy applications to development of new web applications.

I would be glad to visit your offices to meet you to present & discuss this
value proposition further.

Please do let me know suitable date for appointment.   

Kind regards.
