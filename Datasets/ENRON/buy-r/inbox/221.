We are working on the following issues:
	gathering information and developing the analysis of ECTRIC's solvency for purposes of determining whether a CH 11 is appropriate
	organizing terminations/claims/writs and discussion of response strategy with bankruptcy council
	analyzing British Energy contract ($50MM asset net of monetization) referred to in my memo of 3 weeks ago
	aiding the efforts of the adminstrators as requested

Our biggest needs from my perspective are 
			1) a responsive authority to sign off on decisions
			2) access to local counsel (inside and outside)
			3) ability to pay a small number of back office personell

Please call if any questions
