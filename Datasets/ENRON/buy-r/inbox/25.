Dad, this was sent to me by my friend who is working for PriceWaterhouseCoopers.  Good for a laugh.  I've got my reception for making dean's list later this afternoon.  Gotta get my suit out!  Will probably run later too, as I was too tired yesterday when I got out of class.  Love ya!
Cheers big ears,
Jules
