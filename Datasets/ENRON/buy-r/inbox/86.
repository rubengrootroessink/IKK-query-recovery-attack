Dear RICHARD BUY,

The proposed Hewlett-Packard/Compaq Computer Corporation merger may well be today's most talked about technology story. And Fidelity 
is giving you a unique opportunity to hear about it from a key player on the inside. 

As a valued Premium Services client, you're invited to participate in a Lehman Brothers live, interactive Webcast <http://fidelity2.m0.net/m/s.asp?HB5244659747X1198151X90792X> featuring Compaq Computer Corporation Chairman and CEO Michael Capellas and Lehman Senior Analyst Dan Niles on January 23, 2002, at 7 p.m. ET. 

Get answers to important questions like: Why merge? What will it mean for the new company and the sectors in which it competes? What if it does not happen?

Plus, you can pose questions of your own by e-mail any time during the interview. So you can go right to the source for perspectives on HP/Compaq's strategy for moving forward as well as the outlook for the tech sector and the overall market.
