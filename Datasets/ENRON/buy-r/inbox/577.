Hi Vince & Rick, attached is a resume of a friend of mine from when I worked in NYC.  This guys has MIT Aerospace background but has extensive trading and risk management experience--one of those with commercial and technical experience.  He is an excellent team player with great personality as far as working in stressed and dynamic environment goes. He will do well at Enron.  I think he is ready to try Houston like I did as he is ready to raise a family.

Please forward to appropriate parties if there are no immediate opportunities.

Regards,
