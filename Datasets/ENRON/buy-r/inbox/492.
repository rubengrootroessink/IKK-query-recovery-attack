Would one of you like to discuss Board reporting categories of core vs. under review w/Whalley?  Then advise us as to whether the only commodity groups to be considered core are:

European Gas
UK Power
Continental Power
North American Gas
North American Power
Coal

My understanding per the general guidance of the analyst call earlier this week.

Cassandra.

Cassandra - This is a great idea.  Pls. confirm that Rick is comfortable, and I think it makes sense to run it past Whalley.  If this is a matter of sorting, then I would run it past Greg soon - he is the only one who knows how clear these distinctions are at this time.  If this is a very labor-intensive effort, pls. advise.  Thanks.  Paula

Paula-

I hear on the analyst call this morning that we're segregating our wholesale business into 3 categories 1) core, 2) non-core, and 3) under review.

I believe # 1 and # 3 both impact trading; accordingly, perhaps we should customize our reporting accordingly.  Can you review the list below (an excerpt from Appendix 1 of the Risk Management Policy) and advise as to which category each commodity group fits?  Alternatively we can confirm directly with Whalley.  My understanding was this would be a subject of discussion at the Board meeting, and consequently it might help everyone to be able to see the trading results aggregated that way.

Of course if you prefer not reporting to the Board in these new business categories, please advise.  

Thank you,

Cassandra.
