Many of you have not signed up for an afternoon activity for the RAC Credit Offsite @ Del Lago Resort on Friday, November 9.   The sign-up sheets are on the countertop at my desk.   Please choose your activity by this Friday so that arrangements can be made at the resort.

Activities available are:  golf scramble, massage, pontoon fishing, boat ride, volleyball, tennis, racquetball, horseshoes, shopping at the outlet mall, pool tables or lounge by the pool/bar.
