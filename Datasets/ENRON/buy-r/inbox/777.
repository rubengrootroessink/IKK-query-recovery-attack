Rick,
What do you think...do you want me to order the Astros Playoff tickets?   Also, Wanda Curry has 4 of these tickets that she brought with her from EES by way of ECT. Do you want to order her tickets too or just give them back to EES?   She wanted me to ask you first before giving EES the chance for the tickets.
