Bobbi --
In the midst of the Enron bankruptcy in december, I discussed my situation ( my wife's late term pregnancy)  with my immediate supervisor Ted Murphy.  We agreed that with the uncertainty, we should return to Houston and check with Ted's Houston team for next steps.  When I returned to Houston and requested information on my work status, no one was able to inform me whether I was employed or had been laid off.  At this point, I decided to use my outstanding vacation time to find a place to live and prepare for the baby.
We are expecting the baby's arrival at any time.  Afterwards, I will take a paternity leave and discuss my options with Ted at that time.
Regards,
Rudi
