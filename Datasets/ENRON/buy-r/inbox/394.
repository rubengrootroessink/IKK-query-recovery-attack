Hi Guys

The trader has confirmed that they want to copy the existing customer profiles for Bel Gas Phy ZEE HUB to the new Bel Gas Phy Option product types below.  Can you please let me know if this will be okay.

If new profiles will need to be created, let me know and I will send you a spreadsheet of the existing profiles for the physical product type so you can amend them accordingly for the option product types.

Thanks

Imelda
