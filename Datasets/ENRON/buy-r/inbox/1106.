Kevin,

I thought we agreed to take these reserves since EOL lacks the pricing capability for longer dated transactions.  If you want we can restrict trading to 36 months on EOL and approve long-dated transactions on a one-off basis to insure our counterparty positions remain somewhat balanced.

Please advise,
Bill

You and I had agreed to the structure below for '04 and '05 transactions.  We are not taking credit reserves to the extent the trades are offsetting.  Since '04 is rolling off shortly, we should review the EOL needs for East Power and again come to agreement on the pricing structure.  Let me know when you would like to do so.

Ed

There should be no credit on a TVA/Cin spread.   The correlation between the 2 markets is 95% plus.
