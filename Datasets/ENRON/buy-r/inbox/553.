Rick:

I am back in London now.  I finish a project this week w/ a unit of Shell.
I have another project teed up for next week where I am working w/ a
'E-Acumen' a energy risk mgmt software co. who is doing an deployment at
TXU.  This co has an interesting product set, simulation/optimization of
portfolios including the asset side of the biz, and they are based in
Boulder/San Fran.  I also know there is some termoil and they may need a new
CEO soon.  Any interest ?

Otherwise, lets continue brainstorming.#

Good luck with your issues at hand.

karl
