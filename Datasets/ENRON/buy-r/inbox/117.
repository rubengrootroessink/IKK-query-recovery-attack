  <http://e-meetings.wcom.com/images/worldcomlogo.gif>Dear Rick,

Thank you for enrolling as an Instant Meeting user with WorldCom Conferencing. Hopefully, you've discovered just how easy it is to hold a meeting at any time, without a reservation and without the intervention of a conference coordinator. With Instant Meeting, you are in charge -- even spur-of-the-moment meetings are a breeze with your dedicated dial-in number, leader passcode, and participant passcode. Plus, Instant Meeting is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, from your office or on the road.
