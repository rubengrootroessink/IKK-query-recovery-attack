Dan,

Rod Hayslett has agreed to support the sale of the Haina note.  Please proceed.

1)	I want a DASH on the transaction.  RAC signoff on any asset sales is policy.  I view the sale of a note as policy.
2)	I want to make sure that Enron is not making any substantive reps or warranties that could bite us.
3)	I want to know who the buyer is.

Ray
