Did you resolve to improve productivity, cut down on travel, or to spend more time with family members and friends in 2002? Audioconferencing just might be your solution. But, audioconferencing isn't always as simple as it seems. Consider the following tips when you pick up the phone for that next meeting. 

Leader	

Pick an appropriate time for the meeting. Avoid lunchtime hours, if possible. 
Be prompt and end on time. 
Conduct a roll call. 
For large audiences, use Listen Only mode, which mutes all participants until they're queued to talk. Also use an attended service level, which offers a conference coordinator to help manage the call. 
To share a PowerPoint presentation, use Net Conferencing. Participants view the presentation on the Web while listening to you on an audioconference. You control the pace of the presentation and it ensures that participants don't jump ahead. 
If a follow-up meeting is required, select a mutual time and date before the call is over. Follow-up via e-mail. 

Leader & Participants	

Speak clearly and avoid outside conversations or background noise. 
Identify yourself by name when speaking and address other individuals by name. 
Use your voice effectively; vary the tone and pace. 
Use the mute button if you are not speaking. If you do not have access to a mute button, press *6 on your telephone keypad to mute and unmute yourself.
