Thanks for each of your input on the proposed Mass Market process.  I have altered the flow chart to show the proposed new process only.   You will be notified shortly for a follow up meeting.

Key issues to move forward
IT - need consolidated report of agency executed deals in lieu of file for each deal
IT - update the batch process in RPS to capture and load counterparty by GCP ID
Data Capture - match of credit responses with data capture by order ID
Deal Capture - set up of reject letters for increased volume 
Deal Capture/Billing - clarify utility needs for counterparty name
Credit - interface with D&B Marketing Spectrum database
GCP - implement batch load of counterparts to database

Although it was discussed to use utility required name, Credit recommends to continue discussions with TPV or QC for validation of Legal name or consider data coverage source (D&B, Experian etc) and capturing utility name as an alias.  In order to securitize the portfolio, Legal names will be required.

Regards
Molly
