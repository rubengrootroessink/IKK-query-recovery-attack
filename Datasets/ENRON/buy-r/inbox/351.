Rick,

My views are as follows:

- The sale of the deepwater assets makes sense due to their requirement of significant ongoing capital expenditures; the other assets of the company should also be auctioned off concurrently (although we would retain the right to continue to hold them if the offers received were inadequate); research into our commitments to Lehman as the sales advisor previously needs to be conducted (I have asked Don Miller in Corporate Development to research this).

- The fact that the Mariner severance package is considerably better than the Enron package will be is a significant optical issue and not reducing it may create an issue with the creditors committee for the Enron bankruptcy.

- The extension of employment agreements and consulting agreements, in my opinion, should be for a shorter time period, say to March 31, 2002, again in light of the Enron situation and the optics to the creditors committee.

Dave
