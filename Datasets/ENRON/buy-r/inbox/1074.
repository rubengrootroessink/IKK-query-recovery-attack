Subject:	Amendment to Master Netting Agreement


At the request of Robert Eickenroht, attached is a draft of the Second Amendment to the Master Netting Agreement between New Power and the Enron Parties. In order to get this draft to you as soon as possible, I am at the same time circulating it for internal review;  accordingly, there may be additional comments from Enron.  Please call either me or Lisa Mellencamp (713 853 7986) with any questions or comments.
Thanks
