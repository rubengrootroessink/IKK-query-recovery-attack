Hi Rick:  I noticed that you were online.  Have you had an opportunity to look at the budget numbers.  Corp called and wanted to get them so they could start building their spreadsheets for the Lay presentation.  They said we could still revise it up to Friday.  I wanted to get your ok to send the numbers to them.  Thanks   Rick C.
