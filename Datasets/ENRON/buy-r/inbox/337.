Paula and Rex - I have mentioned this several times in the past several weeks, but have not received an answer.  Isn't it time to significantly adjust our 16b list?  There is clearly a new management team making the key decisions, and with all of the frequent Board meetings, it should be easy to do.  Thanks.  MEK
