Rick:  Thanks for reviewing the budget.  Donna's group is included in the Portfolio group numbers along with my people here on the 28th floor.  Assurance Services is the budget for the work Arthur Andersen performs reviewing RAC's controls, procedures, etc.  We are pretty much obligated to take it although we turn around and allocate the cost to the business units we serve.  As far as the presentation in concerned, we are working with the RAC VP's to get a couple of bullet points from each for their key 2002 objectives to include in the presentation.  We will wrap that up tomorrow and I will get the presentation to you to review.  Please call if you have questions.   Rick C.

Assurance services is Donna? Otherwise looks ok to me. Only thing that matters is the total. We can distribute later to each group. Thanks, Rick PS I haven't seen presentation have I?

Hi Rick:  I noticed that you were online.  Have you had an opportunity to look at the budget numbers.  Corp called and wanted to get them so they could start building their spreadsheets for the Lay presentation.  They said we could still revise it up to Friday.  I wanted to get your ok to send the numbers to them.  Thanks   Rick C.
