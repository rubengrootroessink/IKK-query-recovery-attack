Jim Reilly said he had spoken to you recently after he saw me holding a sign
under an I10 overpass.  Would love to get together with you to catch up and
figure out what's going on at Enron and elsewhere.  I have attached my
resume'.  We've all come along way since the BT days.  I'll call you in the
near future to see when we can get together.
