Your call on NetCo related employees - I just don't know the conflict of interest issues or the work load of the various individuals.

Jim- Please add Michael Tribolet to EIM lead position for RAC. I will have a little crossover due to skill sets which I assume is ok, you really just need a lead to coordinate and manage the process. Lets meet on Monday. Can someone that is in Netco also be one of these coordinators? Rick

All, 

We had a preliminary meeting on Friday.  The attached is a summary of the matrix we developed as well as changes from subsequent e-mails.  Note, only one name has been placed in the matrix where two may have been suggested - if the name is not correct then please e-mail me back as soon as possible - only person per box please.  The names placed in the matrix will be directly responsible to the estate.

We need to meet Monday to: (1) agree on the matrix; (2) develop detailed processes for capturing value (trade books, structured deals, hard assets and business sales); (3) understand the approval process required on a go forward basis; (4) develop compensation / retention program for estate, (5) address any administrative concerns.

If you have not done so, please check the names in the matrix to ensure that they are correct and please send me any changes as well as their full names to be utilized for future e-mails.

Regards, 

Jim
