Dear Richard,

Good Morning.

Thank you very much for your suggestions and input with my search for

exciting superior candidate  for that position.

I am writing to ask for your input and suggestions regarding another early
stage Software Company in the Energy space.  They are located in Atlanta
Georgia.  The positon we are seeking to fill is an SVP of Sales.  This
will be a key position,  part of the Executive Management team and will
be integral to driving our client towards profitability and ultimately
an IPO.  If you have any ideas of exciting potential candidates or if
you have an interest your self, please contact meat 781-874-0527 or email
