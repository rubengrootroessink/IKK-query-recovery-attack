In case there is any confusion who is your HR contact following the last 2 days headcount reductions, attached is a updated listing. I anticipate we will make further reductions in HR headcount in line with the wind down of operations but will obviously notify you of these ahead of time.

The Asset team under Stan is not listed attached as it remains largely unchanged.

The people listed attached will be lead by Robert Jones, VP of HR.  Robert, Mary Joyce and myself have set up central specialist HR support teams (not listed attached) based on the 16th floor of the old building to ensure that you and your HR leads have the resources and services they need to provide the necessary HR services for ongoing operations. 

 

Please call Robert, Mary or me with any questions.

David
