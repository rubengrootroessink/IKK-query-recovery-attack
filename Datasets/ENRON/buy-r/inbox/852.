Rick,
While I am not 100% sure of what Greg means by international credit, both B=
ill and I  have recognized that there is a facet of RAC/Credit function tha=
t we are not net long vis-a-vis the direction of the business, particularly=
 the non-energy commodity businesses - steel, metals, paper - as well as th=
e coal business and the crude complex.  What seems to be needed is some peo=
ple that have experience in structures (good and bad) that support the move=
ment of large packages of physical goods from the 3rd world to the first wo=
rld.  Knowledge of the subleties of l/c language, insurance products, dog c=
ounterparties, typical scams, money launderers, lay ranges, demurrage....To=
 that end, we both interviewed and subsequently hired John Collenette, head=
 of credit for an international trading organization - Trafigura.  John spe=
nt 10 years at Paribas and then the last 7 at Trafigura.  He went through 3=
 full rounds of interviews, primarily with the metals guys and incuding Mic=
hael Brown.  My plan was to install him as the 'team lead' in metals allowi=
ng him to get 'enronized' with the idea that he would expand his role to in=
clude global products and EIM.  I guess I will accelerate this process.
In addition, I have also hired a sr spec with metals experience from Koch. =
 We have interviewed a few other prospects with transactional credit experi=
ence.  We are planning to supplement some of this industry knowledge with T=
racy Ngo and a few strong managers with solid credit skills.  The issues we=
 have yet to begin getting traction are how to staff other offices - NY and=
 Sydney principally.  Here we are constrained by current budgets.

Also, I have worked with the operations staff to take away some of the oper=
ational credit issues like chasing down information, money laundering check=
s, calling  for margin, and opening accounts so that we can hire credit pro=
fessionals to analyze credits and deals. =20

Finally, a critical piece of the puzzle is to also strengthen the people an=
d the processes around the logistics of credit - specifically, the logistic=
s function, treasury (l/c issuance/acceptance), and risk management.  It is=
 in the hand-offs of infomation where most of the risk lies, in my opinion.=
 =20

When you are here, we ought to make that a topic for discussion.  Not to ov=
er-state the need, I think it will require somewhat of an on-going focused =
effort and coordination between offices and departments similar to the EES =
style.
