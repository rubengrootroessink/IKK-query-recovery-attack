Attached is a privileged and confidential memorandum concerning the various congressional investigations relating to Enron.  In anticipation of our preparation for and your participation in staff interviews with the House Energy and Commerce Committee next week, I thought you might like to review this background material in advance.  We'll have more detailed intelligence from the Hill to share with you orally when we meet next week.

In order to preserve the attorney-client privilege, and because of the politically sensitive nature of some of this material, please do not share it with anyone.

I'll be back in Houston Sunday night and can be reached first thing Monday morning at 713-345-2572.  In the meantime, please feel free to call me in DC with any questions.  Otherwise, I'll see you next week.

Thanks, 
Michael
