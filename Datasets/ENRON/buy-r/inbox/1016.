Bill, just wanted to give you a heads-up on a market rumor. Scuttlebut we've heard from market is a looming potential downgrade for you guys from Moody's --to NON investment grade. I've told my guys not to read too much into it, but would appreciate feedback if I'm wrong. Just for your information. Thanks. 713-207-3240.
