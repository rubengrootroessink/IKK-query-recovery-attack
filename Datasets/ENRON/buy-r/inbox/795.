Significant New Issuance - CSFB Commentary:

?=09The emerging debt markets were less volatile this week following the st=
abilization in the Argentine financial sector. Although there was no real p=
rogress in improving the country's fundamentals, international reserves and=
 private sector deposits stopped falling, generating positive momentum for =
the market. As a result, Argentina broke through an important 1400 resistan=
ce level this week and the positive tone spilt over into other markets. The=
 Turkish Eurobond market had a very strong week supported by dramatic impro=
vement in the local market: the Central Bank cut its overnight lending rate=
 from 62% to 60% after a successful T-Bill auction on Friday and local debt=
 yields declined sharply. Most of the Turkish curve was very well bid again=
st the background of revived investor activity. The Turkey 2030 benchmark r=
eached its high since the beginning of July at +935 bps spread on Thursday.=
 The Russian market also gained this week on the back of both the general E=
M sentiment and local news on the incorporation of the "financial reserve" =
(designed to accumulate US$1.8bn to help the government service its debt in=
 2003) into the draft budget for 2002. Russian assets are now trading only =
1 point below their highs since the 1998 crisis. For Central and Eastern Eu=
ropean assets this was a strong week with good demand especially for sovere=
ign bonds, although there was no significant move in prices. Despite the ov=
erall positive sentiment, Friday witnessed some weakening in all the emergi=
ng markets, caused mainly by the technical factor of profit taking once the=
 market reached two month highs. The EMBI+ Index closed only 4 bps tighter =
on the week at +882 bps after touching +861 bps during the Thursday session=
.
?=09On its 30th August meeting, the European Central Bank lowered its bench=
mark repo rate by ? point to 4.25%. European benchmark bonds reacted positi=
vely to the announcement and now are pricing in at least another ? point ra=
te cut this year. This is good news for issuers of *uro denominated bonds a=
s the long awaited rate cut will lower European benchmark yields going forw=
ard.
?=09Fitch upgraded the Republic of Estonia's rating to "A-" from "BBB+" on =
Thursday reflecting its strong GDP growth, fiscal deficit reduction and goo=
d fiscal prospects.
