Significant New Issuance - Commentary:

?=09The emerging markets started the week on an extremely quiet note as inv=
estors awaited more news from Argentina, in particular, on possible IMF sup=
port for the country. The situation started to improve on Tuesday night aft=
er Domingo Cavallo's speech intended to support domestic confidence, in whi=
ch he reiterated that the Argentine government would not default on its deb=
t payments. He also announced some special measures designed to reduce the =
government's debt burden, such as an acceptance of bonds as payment for pas=
t-due taxes and bond coupons for future tax liabilities. This announcement,=
 together with positive clues from the IMF about the possibility of a US$6.=
9bn disbursement to Argentina, helped the market to rally around 2.5 points=
. However, the continued fall of international reserves and private sector =
deposits, evidenced by the latest data release, did not contribute to reviv=
e investor confidence and pulled the market down by around 1 point. In Turk=
ey, the week was fairly busy with prices rising on the back of the successf=
ul T-Bill auction and as a result of a technical short squeeze. Real money =
accounts and local banks were active buyers of Turkish bonds helping the Tu=
rkey 2030 benchmark to break through an important resistance level of 80. R=
ussian market activity picked up on the positive news from Argentina, but t=
he rally was not sustained and Russian bonds closed almost unchanged on the=
 week. Central and Eastern European assets had a positive week gaining arou=
nd 0.25-0.50 points in price. Overall, the general sentiment in the emergin=
g debt markets has improved but is still very much subject to stabilisation=
 in Argentina. The EMBI+ Index tightened around 20 bps on the week to at +8=
96 bps level on Friday.
?=09The United Mexican States (Baa3/BB+) placed a US$1.5 bn 8.30% issue due=
 08/2031 on Monday. The bond was priced at a spread of +335 bps over Treasu=
ries. The fact that a Latin American issuer was able to successfully place =
such a large transaction is a good sign that the impact of the Argentine cr=
isis is limited and has not shut down the primary market for borrowers.
?=09The Republic of Latvia's (Baa2/BBB) credit rating outlook was raised by=
 Standard & Poors from "Stable" to "Positive" reflecting an improved spendi=
ng control and better perspective for GDP growth.
