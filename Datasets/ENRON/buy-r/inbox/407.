Standard & Poor's Risk Solutions and Risk Data Bank to develop a scoring model for Japanese SME's
 
Standard & Poor's Risk Solutions today announced that it has formed a strategic alliance with The Risk Data Bank of Japan Limited (RDB), a leading provider of credit risk data, to jointly develop the first advanced scoring model to assess the creditworthiness of Japanese small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
 
The advanced scoring model will be fully developed by June 2002 and will leverage Standard & Poor's analytic strength and global credit experience, and RDB's comprehensive database of financial information and robust default data.
 
As a membership organization, RDB has, to date, operated by aggregating financial and company data on SMEs gathered from its 38 member institutions. Member banks in turn, gain access to RDB's database and scoring models, and use the information to internally rate the financial positions of unlisted companies. 
 
Standard & Poor's and RDB will work together to further develop the scoring model, as well as collaborate to improve the quality of recovery data and develop analytics for a recovery rate estimation model.
