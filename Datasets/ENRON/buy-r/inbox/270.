Jeff - thanks for your help - fortunately the VaR still backtests ok using your corrected data. But did we really have a curve shift of $439MM on September 14th, as your analysis suggests?
Stacey - power is ok too
Tks

Help yourself.  I would not recommend using the numbers that you and David are trying to use.  They are out of a table in ERMS that has no relevance to how the books are calculted.  Unless of course,  you and David know something that I don't and you guys want to start running p&l's .  Please make sure you run by John anything that you plan on giving anyone.

Thanks
