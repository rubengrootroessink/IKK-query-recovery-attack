Rick,

I agree with Rick that three categories are sufficient--if the issues are substantive, they should either result in an increase in the capital price and a "Return below Capital Price" or a "Do Not Proceed" recommendation.  "Other RAC Comments" should highlight any issues succinctly, but are not a substitute for a recommendation and should be read irrespective of being highlighted on the cover page of the DASH.

Regards,

Dave

 Rick:  Are you saying that you just want three DASH categories, i.e. 1) Proceed, 2) Do not Proceed and 3) Returns Below Capital Price  with no category for Issues, RAC Comments, etc.  RC

Subject:	DASH Classification - "Proceed - See Other RAC Comments"

As we discussed yesterday, in our review of our DASH recommendation vs. actual performance we found 36 DASHes that have been approved since late 1999 that carry the recommendation "Proceed - See Other RAC Comments".  Typically the RAC Comments describe substantial issues that must be resolved if the transaction is to be successful.

Given RAC's increased visability and accountability for portfolio performance, perhaps a more forceful description than "See Other RAC Comments" would be desirable which could be  something like: 

		"Issues - Sr. Management Approval Required" 

Therefore, the four DASH categories would be as follows:

	___  Proceed with Transaction

	____ Issues - Sr. Management Approval Required

	____ Returns Below Capital Price

	____ Do Not Proceed

The "See other RAC Comments" could be used as a footnote with an asterisk placed on any of the above categories where we wanted to call the reader's attention to our comment section.  We would, however, eliminate "See other RAC Comments"  as an official DASH classification category.  

Please let me know what you think.  We can instantly make this change or any variation you would like in both the DASH Template and Library.
