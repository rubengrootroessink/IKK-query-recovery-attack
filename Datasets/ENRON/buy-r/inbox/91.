Ray,

We are working on revising the DASH template in order that it can be readily used for asset divestitures, contract terminations, and amendments to transactions.  The new DASH, the template of which should be completed early next week, would be prepared earlier in the process that was typically the case in the past, would contain a RAC recommendation, and would then be used as the approval document for the appropriate committee (Transaction Review or Bankruptcy Management) to recommend or approve a transaction.  This is consistent with past practice (although presumably only business unit, RAC, and legal sign-offs would occur prior to committee review) and with your memo of earlier today.

Your thoughts as to how the approval process should occur after a DASH is prepared would be appreciated.

Regards,

Dave
