Since Sharron Westbrook has been the person providing notices regarding our=
 EES/EWS Thursday meetings, I have forwarded this suggested language to her=
 to use in notifiying all attendees of our planned changes for the meeting.=
  You and I discussed resuming the meetings during the first week in Septem=
ber  - I have indicated that we will resume the meetings during the second =
week.  Beth Apollo has had a house under construction since her return from=
 London and should be moving in on September 1st.  She plans to take off th=
at week to get moved in and settled, and to start her 2 year-old into her n=
ew school.  We could try to patch Beth in by phone that week, but I think w=
e would be better off having her here.  So I made an "executive" decision t=
o resume the next week, on September 13.  That will also give me time to ge=
t with you during the first week in September, while Beth is out, to review=
 with you the reporting tools that we will have developed for use in the me=
etings.  Hope that all of this is okay with you.=20

I have left Rick Causey and Dan Leff messages regarding the outcome of our =
discussions last week regarding this Thursday meeting.   =20

Beth and I have set aside time on Thursday this week to devise appropriate =
tracking and reporting tools to use in the meeting.  -Sally=20

The weekly EES/EWS meeting with Rick Causey, Rick Buy and Dan Leff on Thurs=
days from 3:00 - 4:00 pm in EB3321 is being revamped to insure that the age=
nda and format for the meeting are organized to maximize the benefit from t=
hese recurring meetings.  In reviewing the availability of key players over=
 the next several weeks and to allow time to create meaningful tracking doc=
uments for critical milestones, the Thursday meetings will be cancelled fro=
m now through the first week in September.  The meeting will resume beginni=
ng Thursday, September 13 from 3:00 to 4:00 and will be held every other we=
ek from that point forward.   You will be notified prior to the resumption =
of these meetings in September if you need to put this on your calendar as =
a recurring meeting.  The list of attendees is being reviewed, with the pos=
sibility of reducing the number of attendees in an effort to utilize people=
's time wisely and to create an atmosphere for frank dialogue regarding pro=
gress.
