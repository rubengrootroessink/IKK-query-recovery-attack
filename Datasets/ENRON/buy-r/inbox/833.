Attached is a draft of a Watch Report for Principal Investments as of 8/31/01 which reflects a complete format revision.  The previous narrative Watch Report had grown to 7 or 8 pages while this new format is a streamlined 2 pages.  We would be interested in your comments and suggestions for further improvements.  Thanks for your help!      Rick C.
