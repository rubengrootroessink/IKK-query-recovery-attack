Thanks Sharon and Rick,

I have one request and one question.

One point that came out from our "dry run" meeting this afternoon with a handful of our top bankers indicated that we need to be very clear on what RAC's responsibilities are.  The slide looks like:

*Market risk management - (followed by brief description of what this means)
*Credit risk management - ditto
*Underwriting - ditto
*Portfolio - ditto

Rick, this will feed into the "What went wrong" slide.

My question is related to the "Cash Colloateral" pg. Is "Net Cash" in the legend supposed to be "Net Cash Margin"?

I will be in office Sat. and probably Sun.  

We need to have the complete presentation ready to send to New York for book preparation by Sunday at noon.

Please call me at work if you have any questions.

Thanks for the help,

Kelly
