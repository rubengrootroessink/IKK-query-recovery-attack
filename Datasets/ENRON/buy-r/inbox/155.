I hope you had a good holiday, in spite of all the machinations going on.

I just finished an amazing book called "When Genius Failed: The Rise and
Fall of Long-Term Capital Management".  If you haven't read it, you should.

I'm almost afraid to ask when you might have a slot open for lunch... any
ideas?

Jim
