how about friday, feb ?? 1st or 2nd.  someone has packed me up and also trish/diane.  grrrr. so, i have got to go thru 40 boxes to find my stuff...haven't found my calendar yet.

trip was wonderful, but draining. being by myself to figure everything out was tiring.  highlites of trip:
paris - went to rodin museum twice.  bought a piece that i have a picture framed at the house.
brussels - really liked - pretty old european city with a square/plaza/piazza. very cold.
normandy area - long long story.  drove [will NEVER do that alone again in another country], had to deal with Plan G within about 2 hours, whole area shut down in january.  only me walking about.  very emotional for me.

will bring pics if you want to be bored.

where are you?  on holiday?
