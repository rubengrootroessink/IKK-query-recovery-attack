Greetings!
We still have good seats available in this excellent cross discipline
course. Please pass this notice on to employees in your company on
multidisciplinary teams who need this training to communicate knowledgeably
with their peers.  Or, if you need a refresher in some engineering concepts,
we'd be happy to have you join us.


Please complete the attached registration form and fax it to us by Tuesday,
9/04. FAX:  713-789-6886. Or you may visit our website and register:

Petroleum Engineering for the Geoscientist
Instructor: Hines Austin




Date:           September 10-13, 2001 (Monday-Thursday)


Location:               SCA Training Center  Houston  8:00 a.m.  5:00 p.m.
                        2500 Tanglewilde, Suite 120A


Petroleum Engineering for the Geoscientist covers basic petroleum
engineering in laymen s terms and provides basic techniques for evaluating
reserve potential. The course introduces the geoscientist and other
non-petroleum engineering disciplines to comparative, performance and
volumetric evaluation techniques. The attendee works with and determines the
information required to elevate oil and gas volumes and performance.


The basis of the course is the emphasis on the work sessions that supplement
the lectures. Work sessions represent over 40% of the course time. This
course is a must for geoscientists involved with multidisciplinary teams.
The aim is to enable the geoscientist to recognize the contribution of data
obtained from different disciplines and to perform basic reserve
evaluations.


Who should attend?
Geologists, geophysicists, technicians, beginning petroleum engineers and
those who require a basic understanding of petroleum engineering.
