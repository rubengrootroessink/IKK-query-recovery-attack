Mark:  It has been adjusted (we have added people, and we have deleted several people).  If appropriate, we can and will adjust accordingly,  Let's discuss later today.  Thanks, Rex

Paula and Rex - I have mentioned this several times in the past several weeks, but have not received an answer.  Isn't it time to significantly adjust our 16b list?  There is clearly a new management team making the key decisions, and with all of the frequent Board meetings, it should be easy to do.  Thanks.  MEK
