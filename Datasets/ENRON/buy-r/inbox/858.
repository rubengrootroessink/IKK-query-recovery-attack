Shelly
I wanted to recognize Keith for his quick response times during the last two weeks.  Keith understands the sense of urgency with some of these deals (i.e., when a customer wants to sign ASAP, it is important to get credit approved quickly and get a contract in front of the customer before the he/she changes his/her mind).  Thanks to Keith, we closed 7 deals in two weeks.

Thanks,
Rich.
