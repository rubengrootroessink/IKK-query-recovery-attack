Rick:  There is no legal requirement that the Board determine, approve or r=
atify the Section 16 list of officers (although in practice, we have asked =
them to do so in the past, at least on an annual basis).  Whether someone i=
s an executive officer is a question of fact, and I have not gotten any res=
ponses from others that I have attempted to get information from to determi=
ne whether or not we should update the list (the lack of response, I'm sure=
, is due to the fact that there is a lot of stuff going on).  So, I will gi=
ve you a call to discuss: (i) has your title changed? (ii) have your respon=
sibilities changed? (i.e., are you still the Chief Risk Officer?)  In the e=
nvironment of a Chapter 11 proceeding, is there any need for a chief risk o=
fficer?  (iii) are you still on the Executive Committee (is there still an =
Exec. Committee, does it still meet and what are its duties and responsibil=
ities?).  No one factor is determinative---the issues are:  do you oversee =
or set policy for an important business or administrative function of the C=
ompany?  In our former environment, the answer was easy.  I just don't know=
 the facts in today's environment.  I will give you a call to discuss.  Tha=
nks for your patience.  Rex
