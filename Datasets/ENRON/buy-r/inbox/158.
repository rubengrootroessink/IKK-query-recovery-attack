January Dinner Meeting
Tuesday, January 29th at 6:30 PM

                                                   

Raising of the Kursk
Frans van Seumeren
President and CEO of Mammoet
 
 
The Kursk sank in the Barents Sea following an explosion in August 2000.  The Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation contracted with Mammoet to recover the Kursk.  The scope included cutting away the bow section, raising and suspending the main section below pontoons, and towing the main section to a drydock in Murmansk.  Extensive simulations and model testing were conducted to develop and validate the lifting and towing operations.  Managing the project required close cooperation with the Russian Navy and the submarine designer to design the overall lifting program. 
 
Frans van Seumeren initiated, negotiated and concluded the Kursk contract with the Russian Government for the operation to salvage the Russian nuclear submarine Kursk.  He will describe the technical and operational aspects of the recovery.
