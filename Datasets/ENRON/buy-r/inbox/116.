Tips & Tricks
Every quarter we like to re-publish popular tips and tricks, as voted upon by you. Here are the top three tips from last autumn's e-newsletters-back by popular demand!	 
  <http://www.4at2.com/email_domains/hag/0001/final/images/spacer.gif>	
  <http://www.4at2.com/email_domains/hag/0082/final/images/number3.gif>Drag and Drop Memos
	  <http://www.4at2.com/email_domains/hag/0001/final/images/spacer.gif>		
Memo Pad automatically numbers your memos, but you can also manually change the order in which the memos appear by dragging and dropping them. Simply hold down the stylus on the memo, and drag it to where you want it to go!

  <http://www.4at2.com/email_domains/hag/0082/final/images/number2.gif>Beaming Your Business Card
	  <http://www.4at2.com/email_domains/hag/0001/final/images/spacer.gif>		
When you beam your business card, any attached note will be beamed along with it. Have a resume or a favorite quotation (up to 4,096 characters) that you'd like to share with others? Simply attach it as a note to your business card.

  <http://www.4at2.com/email_domains/hag/0082/final/images/number1.gif>Floating Events
	  <http://www.4at2.com/email_domains/hag/0001/final/images/spacer.gif>		
Floating events in Date Book Plus let you set appointments that "float" with you through the calendar, appearing each day until you've finally completed the task or event. Use floating events anytime you have a task or appointment that isn't necessarily fixed to a certain date. Like picking up dry cleaning-it may be ready on Monday, but who knows when you'll actually have time to pick it up? In Day View, just tap New, then tap Floating Event from the popup menu, and enter the name of the event. Your new floating event will appear as a circle on your Day View until you delete it.

Biking Cross-Country with My Visor Handheld
I'm a partner for a graphic design firm. Taking three months off to bicycle from Washington, DC, to Florence, Oregon, would put a strain on the company. But my partner and our staff had given me their "you go, girl" blessing. They even built a special section of our corporate web site to highlight the trip:
(http://www.gravesfowler.com/noteworthy/beyond.html <http://r.4at1.com/c/e/r/r.jsp?rid=141.2182.10968.42943.4688.233.34125625>). The plan was to post our journal as we moved across the country. It was a beautiful design; now the pressure was on for me to do the writing and get it back to them.

That's where my Visor came in. With a collapsible keyboard and modem module, we had a lightweight package of technology that would fit into my bag and keep us connected. We also carried a backup module to insure we wouldn't lose data when batteries ran low and we were miles from a store. I learned to set up my traveling office on picnic tables, in our tent, on diner tables surrounded by pancakes and eggs, in country churches and steamy laundromats. We stayed in a motel once a week and hooked up the modem to send the week's entries back home.

	
We also collected email messages from folks who were following our progress. As the weeks and miles added up, we realized through this connection how many people were rooting for us and following our unfolding story.	   <http://www.4at2.com/email_domains/hag/0001/final/images/spacer.gif>	  <http://www.4at2.com/email_domains/hag/0082/final/images/011502biking.jpg>	
  <http://www.4at2.com/email_domains/hag/0001/final/images/spacer.gif>	
We feel lucky to have lived out a long time dream. Now in the middle of winter, I sometimes open my Visor, click back to a random summer day and savor the memories.
