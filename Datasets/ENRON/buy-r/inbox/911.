Hi everyone, for future reference the Paul Manning you require is somewhere
in America, I'm based in the UK and have nothing to do with this area.
Kindly amend your E-Mail addresses accordingly.
PS.  Our thoughts are with you all at this difficult time.

Yours sincerely

Paul Manning.

Subject: EH&S Data Management and Process Safety Management Technology Sem

Date: 13 September 2001 14:00
Priority: High

Every quarter or so, Data Systems & Solutions hosts seminars to educate
clients in the process industries on the value of integrated environmental,
health & safety management information systems (EMIS).  Our last seminar on
May 3, 2001 resulted in over 30 clients attending.

We are planning two additional seminars this year (Integrating Process
Safety Management - October 11th) and (Integrated EH&S Solutions - November
6th).  We vary topics/vendors to meet the needs of the marketplace.  For
instance, you will notice that Sustainable Development is a "hot" topic
right now.  Overall, the top three interests we are hearing from our
customers on the topic of EMIS include:

1. Sustainable Development "Triple Bottom Line" coupled with Key Performance
Metrics/Roll-Up Reporting
2. Integrating Information Systems with EMIS
3. Risk Reduction

The ever looming concern over cost justification has become much clearer and
will be addressed in future seminars.  Even today, there is no "panacea" for
EH&S software applications.  Most vendors address the "E" picture or the
"H&S" picture, but do not cover both holistically.  With emerging
information technology protocols such as extensible markup language (XML) it
is now possible to get a true "best of breed" solution that will allow you
to "plug and play" modules instead of hoping for everything in one software
vendor.  Unfortunately, the EMIS software marketplace still remains
unconsolidated and there are inherent risks with selecting a software
vendor.  The goal of our one day seminar is to address all of these concerns
and to help our customers to understand what is involved in a typical EMIS
project...from an initial assessment of your needs, to determining the value
of an EMIS and the core reasons for doing it, to selecting systems where
gaps exist, to allocating proper resources to ensure a successful project,
to implementing the solution, to integrating with other facility information
systems, and maintenance and training.

Let us know if you or anyone from your organization are interested in
attending our seminar.  We want to give you the most value possible in our
one day educational forum.  Please let us know if there is anything in
particular that you would like to get information on that may not be covered
in the topics listed on the agenda.

EMIS services.
