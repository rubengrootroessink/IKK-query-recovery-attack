var in john's booked dropped by $8MM but the var on the gas desk went up by $12MM - volatility increased also 2%
most of the reduction was in cal 03 where we don't have much risk anyway - hence not much change
there is nothing wrong with the model

we bought 15000 contracts and our VAR didn't fall.  Something is wrong with the model

FYI - this is out there as a possible reason why Americas VaR did not come down to within limits as we expected.
In the absence of a fix it looks as though we have another VaR violation.

Kathy,
It looks like the Canadian positions didn't hit VAR last night.  Can you re-check?
Also, I understand Zufferli bot a ton of NG and I thought he was short? (Why is system showing he is long?)
