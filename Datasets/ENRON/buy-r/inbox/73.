To view all 25 characters in this set, tap Menu, then Edit, then Graffiti Help. Press the scroll down button four times and there they are!

Write Stuff
	
New dad David D. tells us how the Visor Edge handheld helped his wife deliver one of the first babies of the New Year.
	
  <http://www.4at2.com/email_domains/hag/0087/final/images/black_section_space.gif>	
"Baby New Year"
	
My wife Jenny and I were expecting our first child together on January 1st, 2002. For her birthday last July I gave her a Visor handheld and she has found several wonderful uses for it in her third grade classroom. For my birthday in August she in turn purchased a Visor for me.

At that time Jenny was 5 months pregnant and I was looking for programs that could help keep track of our busy lives as well as help us keep track of the pending event. I used the Memo Pad to keep tabs on things we already had and items we still needed to pack for the hospital.

I eventually found a program online called Labor Timer. It is so simple to use. All you do is push the on-screen Start or Stop button and it automatically calculates the start time of the contraction, the length of the contraction and the time between each contraction. We used it to practice so that I could work on my coaching techniques as we were planning a natural drug-free delivery.

On Christmas Day Jenny started having contractions. We used her Visor and the Labor Timer to monitor the contractions but that was not to be the day. Again on the 29th she had contractions and again no baby. However, throughout the day on New Years Eve her contractions were very consistent. That night after we rang in the New Year she felt very strongly that this might be the night. As I went to sleep Jenny used her Visor and the Labor Timer to keep track of her contractions. At 4 a.m. she said it was time to head for the hospital. Throughout the wee hours of the morning I used my Visor Edge to keep track of the contractions as we paced the halls of the hospital. The staff was impressed at how I was able to keep such accurate details as we roamed up and down the halls of Labor and Delivery. I fessed up and showed them the program running on my Visor. At 12:51 p.m. January 1st our daughter Zoe Grace was born. I am happy to report Mom, Zoe and Dad are all doing great.

Now I can use the financial calculator to plan for her college tuition and I'll need to get an eyemodule to take pictures for e-mailing and...
