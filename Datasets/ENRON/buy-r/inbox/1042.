Ron and Scott

I have instructed Deal Capture to leave Gigi's on the books.  I intended to catch up to you on this issue.  My group got zealous and asked for the unwind.  We should handle upfront in our processs.

Please find attached the list of clients which I suggest not to contract with in the future.   Enron may not want to be associated with adult entertainment, XXX video, nude tannig salons etc.  Basically, the number of deals is insignificant.

If agreed, can you instruct the Agents not to target such clients?

 

Regards
Molly

I spoke with Erich.  We have 4 or 5 customers to date with names suggesting these types of businesses.  The number of customers is trivial, so if we were to put in place a policy saying we won't do these deals it will have no real effect on business performance.

I will discuss with Molly and Jim and we will decide what to do.  We will then put the policy in place so that, should we choose not to accept these customers, (1) the rejection rights listed in the contract will reflect this, and (2) we will catch them before we book the deal, eliminating any unwind risk.

Ron

Do you know about this?  Is this part of our Code of Business Ethics?

A.K. and Mark,

Please unwind Gigi's Cabaret as Enron doesn't want to associate with this entity.  Thanks.
