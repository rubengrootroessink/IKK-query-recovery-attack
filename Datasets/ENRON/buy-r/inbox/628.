Wow - you are really busy if your lunch calendar is booked for the remainder of the month!  Sept. lunch sounds good.  I sure hope we make good use of the bad news about Skilling's resignation and do some house cleaning - can we write down some problem assets and unwind raptor?  I've been horribly uncomfortable about some of our accounting in the past few years and with the number of 'redeployments' up, I'm concerned some disgruntled employee will tattle.  Can you influence some sanity?

Thanks for kind words. This was a big project, as was the website. We will accept constructive suggestions for improvement. Take care, and lets have lunch in Sept. Rick

Rick, 

Lynn recently demo'd portrac for all of us in Corp Development.  It is a fantastic tool.  It's been needed for forever - I've been pulling together an asset list for Andy and Jeff Donahue - and I know first hand how difficult it is to get the detail that your group has input into portrac.  Donahue also thinks it's a great tool.  Lynn is going to demo it for Andy sometime soon.

I'm working with Lynn and Dave Gorte's folks (Cindy Hudler) to create a livelink library of models, presentations, tax structures, etc. (all the files a corp dev person needs when we actively work an asset for sale).  We hope to have a link on the portrac web page similar to the DASH and COMET links.  It's very encouraging to see how far your group has come in organizing our investment data - Cindy's got a 30GB file of all models.  It sure makes my supposed 6 - 9 month job easier!
