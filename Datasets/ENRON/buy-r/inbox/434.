Weekly
Review
In this week's round-up <http://email.eRisks.com/cgi-bin10/flo?y=hMSR0DERSw0CjE0bNX0Au> of economic, banking and P&C insurance news from an enterprise risk management perspective: global rate cuts boost markets, but economic news continues to be gloomy; Enron faces takeover by competitor; the strange case of the mystery credit crunch; tough times for the mortgage industry; legal action continues over World Trade Center claims. 	
Analysis 
The massive scale of claims arising from September 11 has worried many in the P&C insurance market, but harder rates should benefit those who are strong enough to take advantage of them. In this week's analysis <http://email.eRisks.com/cgi-bin10/flo?y=hMSR0DERSw0CjE0bNY0Av>, we look at how Lloyd's of London is struggling to convince rating agencies and insurance regulators that it is sufficiently solvent to bounce back from its World Trade Center losses and to benefit from a stronger market.

Viewpoint
Will Dynegy clinch a cut-rate acquisition of its troubled arch-rival, Enron? You can catch up on some of the background with ERisk's exclusive interviews with their chief risk officers: we spoke to Enron's Rick Buy <http://email.eRisks.com/cgi-bin10/flo?y=hMSR0DERSw0CjE0bNZ0Aw> earlier this year, while Dynegy CRO Glenn Labhart <http://email.eRisks.com/cgi-bin10/flo?y=hMSR0DERSw0CjE0Mde0AA> was the subject of our CRO Profile in August. Find out what both men had to say about risk management at their firms - and keep checking out the site for ongoing coverage of what is sure to be a major risk management story. 
Still available: Profiles of FleetBoston CRO Paul Hogan <http://email.eRisks.com/cgi-bin10/flo?y=hMSR0DERSw0CjE0Ota0AO> and Swiss Re America's Werner Schaad <http://email.eRisks.com/cgi-bin10/flo?y=hMSR0DERSw0CjE0OIW0AV>	
Feature
Bank credit processes must be up to scratch if a bank is to retain control over credit quality in its loan portfolios. In "Bank Credit Processes and Operational Risk", an exclusive new feature <http://email.eRisks.com/cgi-bin10/flo?y=hMSR0DERSw0CjE0B4W0Av> for ERisk, Becky Walzak of Boston Portfolio Advisors looks at what can go wrong, explores the increasing cost of failed deals on the secondary credit markets, and offers a solution based on ideas within the Basle II regulatory capital reform proposals. 
Still available: full-length articles on Credit Portfolio Stress Testing <http://email.eRisks.com/cgi-bin10/flo?y=hMSR0DERSw0CjE0asT0AS> and Real Options and Strategic Business Risk <http://email.eRisks.com/cgi-bin10/flo?y=hMSR0DERSw0CjE0OtZ0AH>.
