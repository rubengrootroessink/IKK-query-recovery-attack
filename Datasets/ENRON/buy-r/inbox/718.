es a framework under which the Company's exposure to risks shall be evaluat=
ed, managed and controlled, and pursuant to which capital will be allocated=
 and preserved.  The Policy focuses on four major types of risk: (a) market=
 risk; (b) credit risk; (c) operational risk and (d) liquidity/funding risk=
.  These risks shall be managed on a portfolio basis for standard transacti=
ons via various market risk limit structures and credit approval processes,=
 and for non-standard transactions via the Transaction Approval Process and=
 the Guarantee Approval Process.   This Policy provides an overview of vari=
ous risk measurement tools and limits to be applied to these risks, and the=
 roles and responsibilities for the key participants of the risk management=
 framework. =20

Management and employees are responsible for complying with the risk manage=
ment policies and procedures addressed in this Policy, available at http://=

ndividuals within the key functions participating in the Company's risk man=
agement framework will be required to sign a Compliance Certificate, an exa=
mple of which is attached to the Policy as Appendix H.
