Everyone,
 
Paul Flack called from the courthouse at 3:40.  The Judge had taken a break, and they were to reconvene in a few minutes.  Paul said it was going well, but would likely last for some time longer.  Apparently there are around 50 lawyers in the court room.
 
I will send you an email as soon as the hearing is concluded, or, if I receive another update from the courthouse, I will pass that along as well.
 
In the meantime, please don't hesitate to call me if you need to.
 
Terri Richardson
