	I want to personally encourage each of you to join us for the Corporate Leadership Giving Reception TODAY.  It would be a terrific show of support from RAC if a number of us could break away for at least a few minutes to participate in this kick-off to the United Way Campaign.

	For the 3AC crowd, a group will be meeting at the elevators on 3AC14 to walk over to the Crown Plaza at 3:20pm.  I encourage the EB folks to the do the same on EB28.

	See you there!

							Regards,
