I think you will find much more demand than you think for engineers, although the economy is suffering at the moment. It does not sound like this lady has her act together. I wish I knew more about biomedical engineers. You should talk to the head of the dept. and ask who is big in the industry and send them all letters with a resume attached. Don't worry at all about your resume right now, it is almost irrelevant. Your grade point average and salutatorian are relevant. There are very few female engineers in the workplace which will help you a lot. You could work for companies like Enron, Exxon, Shell for example but it would not be in your major. My guess is the major pharmaceutical firms may hire you but you need to research this. The first stop should be the head of the department. Lets talk more on this topic. Love, Dad

Hey dad.  Just wanted to let you know that I went into my undergraduate career services office today (just for the heck of it).  The lady was very helpful but sort of scared me.  At first she was snobby because I hadn't had any experience, but then she realized that I had a lot of skills from my courses that would go on my resume and that I could include my Nantucket work and stuff like that.  No chance of a job in England or Ireland though.  She said it would be too much work for her to start researching foreign companies.  So I guess I'm gonna have to start going to seminars and stuff to get myself ready for job searching.  She's gonna help me with my resume, which I'll proably start on this weekend.  She said summer co-ops are very hard to come by since more kids are looking and companies don't really want people for just the summer.  But she said I'm lucky that I came in so early.!  So who knows.   

I also applied for engineering dean's host today.  The application process was easy, and it kind of hurt my pride when I applied for CAS dean's host and didn't get it, so I'll see if this goes any better.  It will just entail a few hours on Fridays in the spring, and I remember that we both found the dean's hosts very helpful when we went to my freshman Friday.  But I may not get it, so oh well.  Rebecca has not woken up yet today.  It is 5:00.  She says she has a headache.  It has been nice and quiet at least.  I returned a textbook today (went and made copies of the pages i needed to save us the 35 bucks).  I accept cash or check.  Life is good and boring.  I have been very productive the past few days, and I am happy the week is coming to an end.  I will try to have some fun this weekend.  OK that's it for now.  HOpe all's well for you.  Write or call if you're bored/depressed.  Later skat! er. 

Cheers big ears, 
Jules
