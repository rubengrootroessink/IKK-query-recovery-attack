Hi daddums.  Call me for great news!  Too good for e-mail.  Here's my info.
I sent it to mom, as I'm sure she'll want it too:

Also, remind me to give you my tax return info.  Noel forwarded it to me
yesterday, as it got sent back from the Rushing River address.  I got $500 in
traveler's checks and $197 in pounds to start off.  I also plan on getting
about $100 in US dollars before I go.  I'll start packing Wednesday afternoon
to make sure I don't forget anything.  If you think of anything important for
me (besides umbrellas and toothbrush), please let me know asap.  I would also
appreciate a receipt notification from this e-mail, as it contains very
important information.  Haha, do I sound official enough?  Tell Ann Ducharms
and Ted Murphy that I appreciate everything they have done for me.  I think
that's about it.  Talk to you later!

All the very best,
Jules
