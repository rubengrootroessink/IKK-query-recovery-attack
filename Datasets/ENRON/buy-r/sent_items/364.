You are correct!  This is not a new issue, but it seems to resurface on a r=
egular basis.  The issue has been pointed out regularly (the first time in =
connection with the license and regularly thereafter) and each time the bus=
iness has said not to worry, if they can't cut a deal with New Power they w=
ill just pay the $1/MW.  EES has assumed it will pay the $1/MW since day on=
e!

Harry and Gloria:

Jim Keller and I have indeed dealt with this issue in the past (it actually=
 came up at the time we were applying for our TX marketer license).=20

 It is my understanding, and Jim, please comment if my information is "stal=
e", that we were going to choose the option set forth in Sec. 39.352(g)(3),=
 which allows us to make a payment into the System Benefit Fund.  This appr=
oach was discussed with Dennis Benevides, and then, I believe, with Don Bla=
ck, and they were OK with our pursuing this course, in lieu of having TNPC =
provide service to residentials on our behalf.=20

 Please call me if you have any questions:  814-835-0793. =20

Marianne

Ed,

Residential Obligation
Section 39.352(g) of Senate Bill 7 provides that for any REP serving an agg=
regate load in excess of 300 MW, 5% of the load must consist of residential=
 customers. A REP can fulfil this requirement by:
1. Demonstrating that it directly serves residential load amounting to 5% o=
f its total load
2. That another REP serves the residential load on its behalf, or
3. It pays 1 dollar per MWH of required 5% load into the System Benefit Fun=
d.
 EES can fulfil its obligation by entering into an agreement with New Power=
 to serve residential load on its behalf, or can pay the 1$ per MWH penalty=
.
There is an annual compliance reporting requirement and EES can demonstrate=
 compliance if it has an agreement with New Power.

EES Contract,
For price to beat customers, the utilities have by Commission rule, the obl=
igation to allow customers to come and go without restraint for the 5 year =
period conmmencing 1/2/02. The Commission concern may be that Enron will ab=
use this provision by gaming the system. The Enron contracts as currently w=
ritten are within the rules as approved by the Commission. Until the utilit=
ies move to amend the relevant rules, the Commission can only exercise its =
displeasure by appropriate oversight and enforcement to determine what cond=
uct amounts to abuse and gaming. I think it will ultimately be a question o=
f degree and pattern of switching. The onus will be on the affiliated REPs =
to prove abuse and gaming. Fundamentally, it is in the best interest of the=
 market to allow customers to come and go. Customer mobility is the best cu=
stomer protection in a competitive market. Besides, a restraint on customer=
 mobility could have a chilling effect on competition as it will increase c=
ustomer inertia. The Commission will carefully weigh any course of action t=
o insure that they achieve a reasonable balance. For larger than 1MW custom=
ers, they can agree to long term contracts and a restriction on their abili=
ty to come and go.

Please call with any questions,
Gloria

Everyone - =20

I was just informed by EPMI that there may be a requirement for Retail Ener=
gy Providers in ERCOT to serve a certain mix of residential rate class/indu=
strial rate class customers once a certain industrial threshold is crossed =
(300 Mw of industrial rate class load). =20

EWS has not set it itself up to monitor such requirements.  Therefore, I ca=
nnot comment on the accuracy or details of this requirement.  However, it i=
s something we definitely need to look into.  In addition, we (EPMI/EWS) ar=
e getting feedback from the TX PUC that they are not pleased with how they =
see the pilot and the market structure unfolding.  Specifically, they are n=
ot pleased with retail energy providers' contracts that contemplate the rig=
ht to switch between direct access and tariff (and visa-versa).  We will mo=
nitor and need to get more clarity on how the PUC intends to address their =
displeasure.

On the residential requirement front, someone needs to address this.  Speci=
fically, is this true.  If so, what rate classes are considered industrial =
vs. commercial?  Is there a similar requirement for commercial load?  Is TI=
 considered industrial?  Do we already have industrial customers in our por=
tfolio?  Who in EES tracks and monitors issues like these as we enter marke=
ts?

Mike Curry is in the process of tracking this info down from an EPMI perspe=
ctive as they are focusing on more of the pure, large industrial customers.=
  We will share any information Mike receives with the EES group.=20
