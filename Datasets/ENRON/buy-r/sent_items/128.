Dear Robert Brooks:


For Policy: Risk Management Policy, Amended October 9, 2001

Subject: Risk Management Policy Mandatory Certification

On August 14, 2001, the Board of Directors of Enron Corp. (the "Board") app=
roved a new and revised Enron Risk Management Policy (the "Policy").  The B=
oard amended the Policy on October 9, 2001.  The Policy covers Enron Corp. =
and its subsidiaries (the "Company") and focuses on procedures for managing=
 the Company's exposure to risk as encountered in the normal course of busi=
ness.  This Policy establishes a framework under which the Company's exposu=
re to risk will be evaluated, managed and controlled and pursuant to which =
capital will be allocated and preserved.  The Policy also focuses on four m=
ajor types of risk: (a) market risk; (b) credit risk; (c) operational risk =
and (d) liquidity/funding risk.  These risks will be managed on a portfolio=
 basis with standard transactions being subject to various market risk limi=
t structures and credit approval processes and non-standard transactions be=
ing subject to the Transaction Approval Process and the Guarantee Approval =
Process.   Finally, the Policy provides an overview of the various risk mea=
surement tools and limits that will be applied to risk, and the roles and r=
esponsibilities of both key participants and normal employees in the risk m=
anagement framework. =20

All managers and relevant employees of the Company are responsible for comp=
lying with the risk management policies and procedures addressed in the Pol=
icy and are required to sign a Compliance Certificate indicating their unde=
rstanding of and compliance with the Policy. =20
