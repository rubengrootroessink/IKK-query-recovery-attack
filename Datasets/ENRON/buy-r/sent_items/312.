Rick Carson from RAC is currently reviewing all of the interests/assets we have which have been written to zero over the last few years and have essentially disappeared from any form of reporting - a prime example of these would be MidWest Gas Storage which recently emerged as something of an issue.

Rick believes that there are approximately 75 - 100 of these interests/assets for review and he is preparing a list in the next week or so.  When this list is pulled together reponsibility for all of them will fall under Dick Lydecker, this will therefore include Mid West Gas Storage.  Let's hope Dick can get something from our 25% overriding interest.  Dick will be responsible for reviewing this portfolio, managing the risks and ensuring we maximise all upsides.
