Ray- Steel group wants to purchase $15.3 million per month of steel for 3 years. It appears this deal is creating inventory (no offsetting short). Do you have any thoughts on this as acting head of EIM? Doesn't sound like the best use of our liquidity at this point. Rick (We have a million issues to address like this around the company).
