My name is Rick Buy and I saw your note in Points East magazine indicating you could take on some new members. This sounds terrific to me. Are there still "opening"s?

I own a 25 foot Boston Whaler, am new to the area, and would like to meet some nice people and would like to join others on a cruise occasionally. My wife, Janice, likes boating as well but neither of us owns an ascot.

I would love to give you a call and discuss this but I thought I would write this email first. 

Rick
