Rick,

I wanted to touch base with you regarding our Korean Won exposure.  As you know, a remaining issue involves who is responsible for these types of hedges Corp or business unit.   

The currency traders on Hickerson's desk contacted me today.  They mentioned that it is an appropriate time to put a currency hedge in place for 3 reasons:

1.) The spot rate has fallen back to the 1230 KRW/USD level
2.) The forward rate is relatively flat as there is no signifcant difference in 1 year rates between the two currencies.
3.) Option volatilities have decreased significantly over the past month.

Please let me know if (when?) we should discuss this issue further.  The currency traders mentioned that they will bubble this issue up with Jim Hughes again later today.  

Thanks,

Rudi
