Today WSJ article on page 1 is good example of what we try to capture. They weren't MTM'ing their junk bond portfolio and it went against them. They were also trying to increase earnings by taking on more risk, without the risk system in place. They fired cfo and are looking for a risk person!! Good reading. FYI, Rick
