We are pleased to announce that Harold Buchanan will attend MIT Sloan School Executive MBA Program.  Harold and his family will leave for Boston in April.  In the meantime, he will work on special projects for EES and Marty Sunde will be assume leadership of Harold's organization until a replacement for Harold is found.

Please join us in congratulating Harold and in wishing him and his family the very best of luck in New England.  We look forward to his return to Enron in 2002.
