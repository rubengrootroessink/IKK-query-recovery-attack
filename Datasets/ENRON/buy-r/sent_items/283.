We seem to have resolved billing/account  difficulties. Would like to talk to you about setting up a system to manage cash so it can be in place and functional when I decide I have had enough of this place. Give me a call next week if you can. Thanks, Rick

Rick,

We have a $15,000 overdraft protection line in place and a $50,000 revolving line of credit. We are ready when you are. Let me know if you have any questions about your Compass Bank accounts.

Regards,

Craig
