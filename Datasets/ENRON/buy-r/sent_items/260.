I am on the Board of Mariner and attended a Board meeting last week discussing company. They are looking as good as I've seen them since the inception of the deal. It might be a good time to consider selling. Probably still couldn't get it off at book but closer than ever before. Just a thought. (As if you didn't have anything else to do.) Rick
