Bob Bennett, the Skadden Arps lawyer who has been retained by the Company to represent it in the Congressional Committees' investigations, will be here next Thursday and Friday, December 20-21, to meet with you about the interviews the staff attorney for the House Energy and Commerce has requested with you.  I will let you know the time and place.

Please call me with any questions.
