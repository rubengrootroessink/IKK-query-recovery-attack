Mr. Buy,

Just wanted to get back with you to confirm that the income fund that you are invested in has earnings applied on a daily basis.  Attached is a transaction summary that reveals that the interest credited between 2/7/01 and 3/31/01 totals $6,080.71.

 << File: Buy Transaction Summary.xls >> 

Interest rate for the 1st QTR was approx. 1.59%.  On a prorata basis the interest recorded appears to be reasonable.  I would be happy to secure additional information from the recordkeeper concerning daily earnings on your account.  Please let me know if this additional information would be meaningful.

Have a great day!

Kim Bolton
