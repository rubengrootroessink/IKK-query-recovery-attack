Dawn,
Per a meeting today with Rick Buy and Louise Kitchen it was determined that the allocation for RAC- Portfolio (Rick Carson- 100053) of $544K to ENA was incorrect. Please amend as follows:

ENA	 $109K
EPI	$435K

This is necessary because of the asset transfer to EPI and the work associated with these assets.
