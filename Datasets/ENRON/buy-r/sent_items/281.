Bjorn:

Many thanks for your role in yesterday's meeting with Borden Chemical.  It was most appropriate for you to follow-up with Ed and Bob, and skillfully stick-handle the opportunity in the adept manner you did.  As we discussed, it's hard to guess what direction the company will choose to take going forward, but I believe we gave it a good shot.  I spoke with Alan, and he will call Ed and/or Bob later in the week to see what their thoughts are, given time for reflection.  If we do not hear back from Bob by mid-next week, I will call him.   

Thank you again,
skb
