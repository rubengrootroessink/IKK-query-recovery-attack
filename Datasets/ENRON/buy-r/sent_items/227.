Probably unnecessary to attend regularly from my point of view but I have no issue either way. I think it is a good idea to meet monthly with Causey. Rick

Rick: As you may recall, Andy had asked me to attend the Audit and Finance Committee meetings at the last Board meeting.  I was curious whether you thought it was a good idea for me to attend the Finance Committee meetings on a going forward basis (in the event of any LJM  discussion, or otherwise)?  I would be happy to do so, but my feelings won't be bruised if you think it unnecessary.


On a somewhat related point, during my last meeting with Rick Causey of about two weeks ago, Rick suggested that the three of us get together monthly to discuss what transactions are being discussed with LJM (or may have even closed during that time period), our related internal reviews, and documentation.  Are you ok with this arrangement?

Thanks.
Jordan
