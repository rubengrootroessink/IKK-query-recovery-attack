Great. If we have any inkling of a sale it should probably be mentioned at this BOD meeting. We can call an executive committee when an actual approval is required but August can be real tough with vacations. Thanks for update. Rick

Discussions are progressing on the sale of Portland General.  I currently believe that it is unlikely that we will be in a position to seek approval at the August 14th board meeting, but it is possible.  We are working with all of the relevant groups (RAC, tax, accounting, etc.) just in case things break our way.  (Rick, Randy Petersen is working with us from RAC.)

I will keep you apprised as things develop, especially if thing accelerate in the next few days.

I hope you are doing well,
Mark
