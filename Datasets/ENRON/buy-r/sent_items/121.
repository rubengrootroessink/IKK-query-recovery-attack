Effective immediately, I want to sign all Dashes for RAC. I have asked Dave to continue reviewing the deals and initial the Dash but I want to sign them. This will enable me to be more on top of transactions and also allow me to relate to the other things that are going on. Thanks for your cooperation.  Rick
