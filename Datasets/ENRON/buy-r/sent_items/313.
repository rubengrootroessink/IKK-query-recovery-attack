Maybe we need to rethink entire process. I haven't been totally comfortable with it anyway but it hasn't been high enuf on the list. Maybe after BOD mtg. Rick

He's right in that looking at curves where we generally don't have much of a position, will not add much value. I'm having Frank Hayden check this assertion. 
Bottom line is, again, the middle office groups are either poorly staffed, poorly skilled or too distracted to administer the risk process effectively.

When Frank comes back to me I'm tempted to suggest two things, for which I'll need Whalley/Lavorato/Beck to buy into:

1	Curve validations are submitted to us before anybody else;
2	They concentrate on more significant factors (e.g. Volatility, correlation, the Alberta Power curve)

This person has no clue.  Reviewing gulf coast basis locations probably won't find the next EES lock box problem.
