Spoke with Louise Kitchen on another matter but unprompted she mentioned she really valued the watch list work as well as the snapshot effort. She actually raved about the whole effort. Keep up the good work and let the group know it is valued. Now just do it faster and more efficiently so you  can do other stuff as well!!! Rick
