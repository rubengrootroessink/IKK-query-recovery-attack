Dear Rick:

Just a quick followup to my voice mail of earlier this afternoon---

I represent an Executive Search Firm based in Atlanta and have been retained by an international leader in the energy industry to pursue Director-level talent; as it happens, my client has recently indicated an express interest in speaking with you.  Since I'd imagine you've been inundated with calls and e-mails similar to mine, in an effort to eliminate any confusion I should tell you that we tried to contact you yesterday (my associate, Michael Allen, left you a voice mail).

I understand that the environment at Enron must be a challenging one at this point; however, if you're interested in talking/listening and are in a position to take a short break, the President/COO of my client company is in Houston today and is curious as to whether you'd by some remote chance be free this afternoon or evening for a brief chat.  I realize that this is highly unorthodox, but also feel that standing on ceremony is perhaps not always the most prudent approach.

I'll wait to hear from you in regard to your interest level---and if you're not available today (as I'm assuming to be the case), we can obviously reschedule for a time that's a bit more reasonable.  Thanks---

Sincerely,

Marcy Brinegar
