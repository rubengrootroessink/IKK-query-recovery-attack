Rick,

Kelly Johnson called and asked for a copy of a presentation that you mentioned to Paula Rieker as presented recently to the Finance Committee.  She said it was called "Distribution of Risk - Enron's Information Advantage".  I don't believe this was included in the formal Finance Committee Book in the past year.  Do you know when it was presented and who prepared the presentation?  I will track down a copy for Paula and for our records.

Thanks for your help,

Sharon Sullo
