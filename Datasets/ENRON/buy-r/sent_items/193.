rick, i wanted to write to thank you for the time yesterday. i found it
interesting and while our businesses are different, many of the experiences
are similar.

i was also hoping that you could send me a sample form of your "dash"
document as that would be useful for me.

you can fax it to 469-357-6406 or email it to me.

again, thks

bill
