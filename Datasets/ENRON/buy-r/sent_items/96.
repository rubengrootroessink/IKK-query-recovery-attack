Bank deal happened. Hopefully we can return to "normal" (asylum) now. I imagine AF is not enjoying any beach right now. Thanks for the laugh. Rick

Rick.

Hang in there.  Beleive it or not, everyone in the industry I talk with is
pulling for Enron.  I hope the bank deal comes through quickly.

I wonder which beach AF is on right now.

I thought I'd pass this along in case you need a laugh.

Jim
