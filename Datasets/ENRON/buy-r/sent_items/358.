The Houston Astros are on track to clinch their 4th Central Division title in five years and return playoff baseball to Houston and for the first time at Enron Field.  Though many business units have their own tickets for these games, the Corporate Marketing team would like to make the corporate tickets listed below available to the Management Committee on a first come, first serve basis for the 2001 playoff games tentatively scheduled to begin around October 9th.

Enron's Corporate Suite (includes 14 tickets and two parking passes) 
Four (4) Diamond Club Level 
Four (4) Club Level 
Four (4) Dugout Level 
Four (4) Field Level 


We will be accepting requests for these tickets by game number and by series. (Ex. If you were requesting tickets to Game 2 of the League Championship Series (LCS) you would be asking for tickets to a game that could be played on October 10 or October 13 , per the schedule below, depending if the Astros have home field advantage.)  As in the past, these tickets will be billed to your company number and cost center.    

If a game is listed as "if necessary" there is no guarantee that this game will be played due to various reasons such as home field advantage and length of series.  If you select one of these games and it is not played, the game will not be able to be replaced with another game.  Tickets for games not played will not be charged to your company number and cost center.

Please respond to Greg Grissom by email ( <mailto:greg.grissom@enron.com>) if you would like to request tickets or if you have any questions.  

The playoff game schedule and costs associated with these tickets are as follows:
