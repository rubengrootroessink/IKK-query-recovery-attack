Michael    -- as requested in this morning's meeting (Houston time)
attached below is the file which reflects the graphs that we spoke about this morning.

There were 16 errors last week for all business units(10 of which were Europe's).  An "error" in this case is usually very material, like not being able to pick up the whole UK power position and p/l.

we are tracking several Metrics to understand how Human vs IT processes are affecting the daily aggregation effort.

I am happy to discuss if you would like.

It may be easier to read if you have someone print out the graphs -- the come up rather small on the screen
