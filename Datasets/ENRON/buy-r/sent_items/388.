I had my weekly update meeting with my team on metals and was quite encouraged by the report. Seems like real good progress on all fronts. As400 systems work, var implementation and trading results all seemed positive. Some issues around SAP/AS400 reconciliation but recognized.

Metals was one of my biggest worries but has slipped way down the list. Great work to your team.
