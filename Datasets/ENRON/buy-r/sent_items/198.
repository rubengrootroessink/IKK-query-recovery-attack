Elizabeth- I think it best that at this stage I opt out of this engagement. The situation I described to you is looking more and more like it is going to happpen and there is a real possibility I am totally engaged by the time this conference comes around. I am sorry if this poses a problem for you but there should be plenty of time to arrange an alternate. Rick

Hi Rick, hope you're doing okay .  . .  
Have a request re your write-up.  Can we,  please, shift the emphasis from the 'effective cro' - to how you managed the  risk inherent in the huge transition Enron has made, completely evolved, from an  energy to an ebusiness company.  Address online marketplaces/the value-add;  the shifting strategies involved in transitioning the company . . .  
Is this okay?
I'll need the paragraph/bullets by Thurs pm, if at  all possible.  Thanks, Rick and take care -
PS  Also need your brief bio and complete  contact info (incl mailing address)
