I worked there for 4 years, including the 93 bomb incident. This whole thing is beyond my imaginations ability to comprehend. Rick

Take a look at these pics! For anyone who has worked or visited the WTC area, these pics are incredible. Just looking at the devastation to the surrounding buildings is shocking.  My friend worked at Banker's Trust at 130 Liberty and these pictures were taken from and around that building. Sherron
