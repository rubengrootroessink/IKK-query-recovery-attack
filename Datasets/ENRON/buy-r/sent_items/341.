I would like to extend my appreciation to you and all who contributed to the preparation of the Audit, Finance (and combined) meetings books, policies, simulations, calculations and machinations involved in this effort. It was huge. I would be happy to sponsor a happy hour if anyone is interested. I will not be able to attend but would love to. Please pass along to all in group. 

I will be out after today's meetings for a while but I can be reached and I will occasionally check email and voice mail.

Rick
