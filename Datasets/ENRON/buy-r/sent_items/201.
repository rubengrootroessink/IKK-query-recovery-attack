Karen- talked to Whalley on this. He said he is going to kill deal but needs to do it carefully so he doesn't de-motivate people. So I guess we should keep working on it but it most likely won't go anywhere. A big concern Enron has now is that we have $7 billion of int'l assets and the fear is that we lose people and no one will be around to monitor and operate these assets. You need to use discretion on this but not waste too much time. Rick

Rick,

The name of the biomass power plant in question is Bulacon, originated by the APACHI group in 1999.

Thanks.
