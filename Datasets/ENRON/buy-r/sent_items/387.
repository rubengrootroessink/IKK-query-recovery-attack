Bill Bradford quoted the reserve to Derek Davies prior to the deal being booked and Derek informed me that once the deal was book they sent the requested amount.  I will call Kathy Reeves in Calgary to confirm.  Should you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me.

Thanks
Wendy
