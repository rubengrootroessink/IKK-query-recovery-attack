My office is fine. We will still meet prior to that as scheduled I presume. I also would like a debriefing on Friday's hearing. Thanks Rick Buy

We will be meeting with Wilmer Cutler at 10:00 a.m. on 12/12/01.  I told 
them we could do it in your office, but if you would like to do it somewhere 
else, just let me know.
