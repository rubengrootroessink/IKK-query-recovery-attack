I know you guys are all very busy right now, but we are trying to move forward on the Doorstep activities.

Last I heard you and Rick Causey definitely wanted us to do the London ones.

Any help you can provide in terms of finding a RAC resource to help on this on  would be appreciated.

Beth

Dear Ted,

We are all set for the metals doorstep to be performed the week of Nov. 5th with the exception of a name for the RAC resource.  We are starting to plan the review and would like to involve RAC.  Who have you designated as the RAC resource (Brenda Herod from Operations will be the person responsible from the operations side)?  

I'd like to get Brenda and RAC together some time this week if possible.

Thanks!
