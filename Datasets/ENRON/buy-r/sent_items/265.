Rick,
 
Ted Murphy is chasing me up for answers on his corp allocations.  Can you provide any detail to the April allocations and why they might be more than budget?
 
The 2001 Corp allocations budget shows your name as the contact point for RAC, if this is not correct could you please provide a new contact name.  
 
Thanks in advance,
 
Rich
