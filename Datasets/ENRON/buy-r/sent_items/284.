Vlady- you may have to do this for me as I will be in NYC the day before with Moody's and there is a chance I will be delayed. We should develop what we want to say together so either of us can speak. Tx Rick

June 13 - The US Power Market with Rogers Herndon
June 20 - The US Gas Market with Hunter Shively and Chris Gaskill
