Scott- I discussed the sale of Mariner's deepwater assets with Dave Gorte and he confirmed that any sale would require both creditors committee and bankruptcy court approval prior to consummation of the deal. We don't believe there would be any issue with the sale. I hope this is consistent with your understanding. Rick Buy
