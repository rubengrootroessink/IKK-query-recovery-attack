Attached is an invitation to the Summer Picnic this Saturday, June 23 from =
4:00-9:00 pm at the Regal Ranch.  Many of you may have already received thi=
s, but I wanted to extend my personal invitation to you.  This is a really =
fun activity, and has traditionally been one of the best opportunities to v=
isit with our Program participants on an informal basis.  This is a family =
outing with lots of activities for the kids, and you can come and go as you=
 please.

Please make an effort to attend on Saturday, even if you can only join us f=
or a little while.  Feel free to pass this invitation on to other executive=
s in your business unit.  The Analysts and Associates tell us that this typ=
e of exposure to our business leaders helps drive excitement and enthusiasm=
 within the Program.  Your support of events like this is incredibly valuab=
le, and appreciated.

If you can join us, please rsvp to Jackie Coleman by email, or at extension=
 x54070.

Thank you,
Billy
