I will think about it. We are achieving the correct outcome here but the timing is off. Concentrate on Caulfield and Oman. Get Brown involved to make sure we get those guys. Use Ene options as a currency to entice them. Upside much better than Chase/JP. Just a thought. Rick

Rick
I am obviously at pretty close to an all-time low in my most recent career  at Enron. I need to talk to you about where this is going. I would appreciate it if you would think about this over the weekend and I will schedule some time to discuss with you next week.
