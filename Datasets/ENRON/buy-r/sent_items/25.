Subject:	The Euros

Today, the Euros are coming and John is going to be running this negotiation - here's the bad news they are not coming until 3:30pm today so we may have to work late.

Barry Tycholiz will be running this team. Barry - talk to Andy on form if you need help - you will also need to think about getting some traders available over week-end.

The Schedule outline is based on initial overview discussions/presentations  and then more detailed discussion can occur in individual groups the outline is as follows:

It may be better to split up earlier but I leave all those decisions to Andy.  

4:00		Introduction			John Lavorato & Louise Kitchen
4:45		Financial Overview		Wes Colwell
5:15		Risk Overview			Buy / Port
5:45		Credit				Bradford
6:15		Back Office			Beck/Hall	
6:45		Systems (EnronOnline)		Jay Webb	
7:15	            Mid/Back Office Systems	Jay Webb
			Infrastructure			Jenny Rub

		
Please make yourselves available - the meetings will take place in 2991

Tammie - please organize lunch and refreshments etc on John's card.

Tammie - please check availability.

Thanks for your continued understanding.

Louise
