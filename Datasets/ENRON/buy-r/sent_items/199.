Agree- thats what I thought when I met with her over there. Why don't you give her a call and try to arrange something. One thing I would rather not pay any relocation expenses since she is moving on her own accord. Have Suttle call her also. Tx Rick

This is a slam dunk with Alan Ford moving back to Quilkey's team.  Actually it may put us in a better position for Asia Pacific based on her credit experience.
