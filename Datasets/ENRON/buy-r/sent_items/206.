Rick,
 
I'd like to introduce you to our company and set-up a one-hourconference call and discussion with you and/or someone you trustto evaluate this opportunity.
iSpheres Corporationisco-founded by the Chairman of  Computer Science Department at California Institute of Technology.
iSpheres enables dynamic arbitrage opportunities in commodities  trading. With iSpheres, trading firms wrap applications like steel  marketplaces, energy marketplaces, demand planning systems, and production  planning systems as components, and derive additional business value by  monitoring these components for real time interdependent events and then  reacting to those composite events  based on business rules.
iSpheres provides a software framework for developing and deploying these  loosely-coupled Web Services or Meta-Applications. These applications are  assembled from multiple components, each of which was previously itself an  application and data source, to enable new business processes. 
For example, a $22 billion investment bank uses the iSpheres Meta  Application Framework? to  detect and react to interdependent market events. This enables them to optimize  and automate the acquisition and response to relevant dynamic events in  their Market Intelligence information environment. 
The build out of the Internet and the rapid  deployment of eBusiness applications over last several years has established the  need and created the ability to build and deploy loosely-coupled Web Services or  Meta Applications. 
Please advise, otherwise I'll  follow up with you in 3-5 days.
Thanks,
H. Enzo Olfati
