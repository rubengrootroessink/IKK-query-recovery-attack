Rick:  As you know, a couple of months ago we formalized the Friday afternoon RAC training (1 hr. 1:00-2:00) with Stephanie coordinating.  Despite the fact that she has arranged for some interesting topics, attendance continues to dwindle with some groups of RAC not represented by even one person!  I think we need to get you to send out a RAC- wide e-mail emphasizing how important the training is!!!    Please call if you wish to discuss.  Thanks for your help!   Rick C.
