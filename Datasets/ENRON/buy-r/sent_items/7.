I think we do not need Board Approval, but they should be notified at the next meeting. I believe I discussed this with Pug and that is what we concluded. Therefore, we need a new DASH and a quick summary of transaction which would include changes from original deal. Rick

Conferring with Gorte, we need a new DASH for the India sale due to 
1) the time since signing (5 months)
2) downward change in purchase price
3) general change in circumstances of Enron
 
In addition to updating the numbers (as we discussed this morning), we should include
an ownership structure diagram and a legal risk memo concerning what bankruptcy 
related approvals are required (if any).
 
Whether or not Board approval is required is possibly an open issue. We will research.
