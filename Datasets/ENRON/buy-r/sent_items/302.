Thanks for note. I recall our conversation. I've had surgery but as you know the worry is did they get it all? Surface tissue of tongue on bottom right. This is so weird since I don't smoke or dip which are the primary risk factors. Thanks for your concern and I will let you know how this goes. I have found that information control is critical so please don't discuss with anyone. I go back to MDA in a month for follow-up visit (ultra sound of lymph nodes). Rick

Rick - I recently heard you had had surgery at MDA for a malignancy and wanted to send you my very best wishes for a full, complete and fast recovery!  As I think we have talked in the past, I have had a long-term association with MDA for what was an awful tumor (spinal Ewing's sarcoma) which was aggressively and successfully treated there.  In fact, this year, I will celebrate (and I do mean celebrate!) 20 years since diagnosis.  I hope you will have a similar tale to tell many years down the road.  Rick, it there is anything I can do for you as you recuperate or journey through this experience, I hope you will let me know.  In the meantime, please know that lots of friends and associates are praying for you and hoping to see you doing the things you enjoy very soon.  Take care, Rick!  My best, Paula
