Rick,

Attached is the resume of a guy who has been managing the $12 billion private placement business for American General for the last several years.  AG is being bought by AIG and he is likely out of a job.  He has a deep background in credit and is based in Houston.

I had lunch with him, and my assessment is that he is really strong and could contend for a high-level finance or credit spot at Enron, if one opens up.
