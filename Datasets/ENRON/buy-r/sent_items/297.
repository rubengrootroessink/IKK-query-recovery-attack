Subject:	Risk Management benchmarking survey

Based on recent discussions with several energy firms, there appears to be
interest in conducting a survey which
*	summarizes the current state of risk management best practices
within the industry, and
*	provides benchmark data addressing current levels of risk based
performance for various energy related lines of business

To respond to this interest, we would like to conduct a survey which
addresses these goals. We have prepared a proposal which outlines our
approach for conducting a survey, and provides samples of expected output. I
will be in touch sometime next week to discuss the proposal with you, and
determine your interest in participating.

I look forward to speaking with you, and potentially working with you as a
participant in this project.
