We are working on the following issues: 
        gathering information and developing the analysis of ECTRIC's solvency for purposes of determining whether a CH 11 is appropriate

        organizing terminations/claims/writs and discussion of response strategy with bankruptcy council 
        analyzing British Energy contract ($50MM asset net of monetization) referred to in my memo of 3 weeks ago 
        aiding the efforts of the adminstrators as requested 

Our biggest needs from my perspective are 
                        1) a responsive authority to sign off on decisions 
                        2) access to local counsel (inside and outside) 
                        3) ability to pay a small number of back office personell 

Please call if any questions
