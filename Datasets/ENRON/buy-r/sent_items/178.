Rick Buy, the Business Unit Head for the RAC group, and I logged onto his computer on Friday, January 26, 2001 to review information for an investigation on one of his employees.  We logged on at 3:01 PM and logged off at 3:15 PM.  Please make certain that the records reflect this investigative effort so Mr. Buy's name does not come up in a random search for accessing inappropriate websites.  If you have any questions, please call me at Ext 30649. Thank you. 


Sheila Walton
HR Director
