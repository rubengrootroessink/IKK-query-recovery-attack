As per our discussion last week, Sally will get with you and review the closing of the books that occurs each night.  This is in reference to the issue of which of the approximately 1200 books get closed easily and which ones require some miracles.  The goal is to better understand the issues at the commodity and/or business unit level.

Thanks.
