Dick Foster is a consultant to the Board of Directors who works for Mckenzie. Each BOD meeting he wants to meet with a group and we are on the list. I talked to Rebecca Carter and suggested we present him the bank presentation and she thought that was a good idea. Please make yourself available for this. Ted - if you can stay an extra day it would be helpful but not essential if you need to get back. Let me know. Tx Rick
