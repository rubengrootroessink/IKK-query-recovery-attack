I see no reason not to except they rotate out in a year. Maybe we could have them rotate to another group in RAC. We need bodies so my vote would be to take him if he passes our test. Rick

What is your view on taking analysts from the program in the group?  He may be able to help with some of the credit analysis that we are backlogged on?

Mr. Bradford:
 
I just wanted to reiterate my interest in a RAC  rotation, following our conversation last week. I have had a chance to  speak to some analysts in RAC and I am convinced that it would be an  unparalled learning opportunity. Once again, I will be starting in the analyst  program this July, and I am graduating from UT Austin with both  a BBA and MPA. I am also taking the CPA exam this May. Lexi Elliot from HR  should be getting in touch with you following my conversation with her this  morning regarding a RAC rotation. Many thanks once again for your  assistance.
 
Regards,
