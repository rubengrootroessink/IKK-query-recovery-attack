Rick,
Let me know if you would like to get together to discuss how the Raptor unwind is accomplished from a mechanical standpoint, as well as, what comes back to Enron in the transaction.  I would happy to sit down and walk you through it.  Just let me know when might work for you to get together.  Thanks Rick,
Ron Baker

I think that all investments that were hedged in Raptor are on th MPR and are being monitored and reported against.  Is this true?  Ron, will you take the lead in making sure we have a smooth transition on this?  Thanks

Now that Raptor is blown up, should we begin valuation efforts of assets and include in merchant portfolio. I am not familiar with details of how it unwound so I don't know what we are left with. Is this worth a meeting with you or your designesss? Rick
