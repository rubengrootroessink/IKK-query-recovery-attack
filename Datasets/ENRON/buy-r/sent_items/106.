We are trying to get the banks out of our hair a little bit here so let me know if there are any more requests for info and don't send anything to them without clearing it with me first. I will run sensitive stuff past Lavo and then try to let the banks know they have enough know. They are calling people directly now and we need to stop that. Thanks, Rick
