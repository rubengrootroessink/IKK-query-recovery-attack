Rick,

I just realized that I failed to thank you for coming to the Woodlands last month to speak to the EAM and AOPS teams regarding risk management at EES.  In the brief time I've been at Enron, I've focused on bringing a more disciplined approach to, and understanding of, the importance of identifying and managing the risk inherent in the EAM business.  However, you provided a far more global perspective, including the view senior management, the Board, and the investment community. It meant a lot to the group to have someone from senior management take the time to meet with us.   

I'd also like to acknowledge the support we've received from Jay and others within RAC  - I appreciate their efforts.

Again, thanks for the visit.

Dave Roberts
