Thank you for your time to discuss Perry Gas.  Michael and I have talked to 
Jim Keller, EES Legal, and initiated placement of Michael on the Creditor 
Committee.  We are the largest unsecured creditor.  Jim is working with 
outside counsel and will be providing documents to Michael to insert him 
quickly in the process.  Michael will represent us for both EES and ENA.

Regards
Molly
