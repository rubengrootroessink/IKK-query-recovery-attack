Apologies.  I dropped H Scutt from the list but overlooked the total score.  
Based on your note, everything else appears to conform to the standards.  
Consider the file just below (RAC Rankings Y.E. 2000 - 12.12.00.xls) as the 
final version going forward.  This captures my presentation and issues coming 
out of today's discussion with the MD's.  Phone with questions.

Hi Steve

The total score should equal 550 rather than 600 - 11 managers and above 
times 50 point allocation for each one
