Dick:

Please find attached the risk book update for the EAS and NEPCO active project 
portfolios for week ending February 23, 2001.  

The updated EAS and NEPCO project risk book data has been received, but it is 
currently being reviewed before issue.  The unspent reserves, however, have 
been updated with current data.  



Please call should you have any questions.
