Thanks for your note. I want to wish you the best of luck in EES. As far as 
RAC's issues with EES, I would suggest getting together with Tribolet and 
getting some of the lists that have been put together as part of the task 
force. I would also suggest attending the task force meeting, providing EES 
management is agreeable, to get a better picture of what is going on.

Again, I hate to see you go but it will still be value added to RAC and 
Enron. Have fun!!

Rick
