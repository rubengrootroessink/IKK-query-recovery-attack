Rick, 

Attached is a listing of various incremental Phase II l/c's which we recently 
put together as part of the selldown.  The first table highlights the two 
l/c's which the sponsors have committed to.  Enron would have to pick up 
either 65% of these (if we can get MSEB to pick up their 15% share) or 80%.  
The other l/c's in the second table are solely the responsibility of DPC.  It 
would be up to the sponsors to decide to what extent they want to help 
support these.  Let's discuss if your numbers are different from these.
