Chip is assigned to North America primarily but we asked him to get up to 
speed on the India situation in case a new deal should arise there that 
requires RAC input. He is a sharp guy with lots of project finance experience 
and also worked in London for Eastern.  If you don't want him involved and a 
transaction arises it will be difficult to get someone up to speed quickly, 
given the complexities. Rick
