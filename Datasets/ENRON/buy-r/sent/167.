Spoke with John Sherriff this am re prc for London RAC people. John said they 
included our people for cross calibration purposes but we could rank our 
people where we saw fit. So I don't think there is any issue here. The 
Houston PRC rankings should stand unless there was new information brought to 
light to you Steve that calls into question a person's ranking. 

Sheila- please double check with the London HR people that this is 
straightened out. 

Thanks, Rick
