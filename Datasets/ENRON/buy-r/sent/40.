To all,

The New Retail Power System (RPS) has been implemented, and there are several 
features of RPS that I would like to share. 

1.)  Our Net Open Position is more accurate as a result of booking deals more 
reflective of batch models rather than Wholesale equivalent positions.

2.)  Our P&L is more accurate as a result of the position change and the 
ability to import retail energy curves into RPS rather than only wholesale 
curves.  

3.)  T&D positions can now be captured for Deals in RPS.

4.)  Regulatory Switching Options are being captured in RPS, which captures 
value of EES' option to serve customers during the CTC period.

5.)  Reporting capabilities are more timely and effective.


The Power Team is confident that RPS will better serve our business.
