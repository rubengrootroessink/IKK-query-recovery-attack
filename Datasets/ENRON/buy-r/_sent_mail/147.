Spoke w/ Skilling re OI "binary" decision. He is willing to enter into the 
deal. His rational is that he thinks we will be ok on OWC in the final 
analysis. He did  say to reserve for the deal adequately and structure it as 
appropriate for the circumstances. He also wanted to know if there is 
anything different here than on OWC. I told him that it wasn't significantly 
different (both strong underlying businesses with huge event risk attached)

Lets get dash completed and then I will voice mail Jeff w/ specifics and get 
his verbal signature.
