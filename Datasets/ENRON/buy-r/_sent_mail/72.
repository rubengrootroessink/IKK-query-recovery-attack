I'm actually holding up fine, thanks for asking.  Stress?  What stress?!  
Fortunately, our credit group has been able to cross-support as an effective 
team to support the other business that's going on OUTSIDE of California.  Up 
here, we call the California situation "Project Titanic".  Do you think 
that's too pessimistic?!

Subject: How Are You?

Are you alive? How is your health? Is stress a big part of your life?

Hope all is well. You are doing a great job there for us but if it gets to be 
too much we'll try to help. I noticed that west power has already made a 
fortune this year so it must be crazy.
