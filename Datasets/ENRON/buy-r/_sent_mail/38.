Credit recommends offering the following two options to the New Power Company 
(NPC) as it relates to Firmwide collateral thresholds:

Option #1 - NPC receives a $10MM collateral threshold with standard 
collateral annex terms.

Option #2: - NPC receives a $40MM collateral threshold with standard annex 
terms as well as the following two additional required covenants:

a) Liquidity - Maintain minimum liquidity of $300MM, where:
 Liquidity = cash + marketable securities - debt - LCs - third party 
guarantees

b) Tangible Net Worth - Maintain minimum tangible net worth, as defined by 
GAAP, of $450MM
 Note: TNW will be equal to equity less intangible assets including but not 
limited to goodwill, trademarks, etc. 

Regards,
Molly
