Rick Buy, the Business Unit Head for the RAC group, and I logged onto his 
computer on Friday, January 26, 2001 to review information for an 
investigation on one of his employees.  We logged on at 3:01 PM and logged 
off at 3:15 PM.  Please make certain that the records reflect this 
investigative effort so Mr. Buy's name does not come up in a random search 
for accessing inappropriate websites.  If you have any questions, please call 
me at Ext 30649. Thank you. 


Sheila Walton
HR Director
