After rereading 3 times I see your point. Didn't mean it that way. Before I 
sent it out I had Ted and Karen review as well as another person in corp. 
None had any comments. I asked Dave Gorte if he saw anything negative in it, 
he did not. Didn't mean to slight you in any way and I apologize if I did.
