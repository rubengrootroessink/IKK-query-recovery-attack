Thanks for the information on the GB 58. This boat far exceeds what I want. 
After the show I concluded that  either a 42 or 46 foot classic is most 
appropriate for my needs. Would like to also consider the 36 foot model. 
Thanks for the info though and keep me in mind. I enjoyed talking to you at 
the boat show and my wife was quite sold on the GB line (after looking at 
most everything there in detail).

As I mentioned I am in no particular rush as I probably have a year before I 
want to go forward on this but if something exciting came up, either new or 
used, I may be interested. Again, I would need your help in obtaining 
appropriate dockage( in someone's backyard!)

Thanks, Rick Buy
