I was really hoping we could do this on a best efforts basis with all of us 
covering any issues arising during the month of December. Since there seems 
to be insistence on a date certain there is no choice but to have Steve start 
in EBS on 1-1-2001. Ted can't physically be there until then. It will be 
difficult to have full RAC responsibility without physically being there.
