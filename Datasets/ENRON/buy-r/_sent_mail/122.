Hi- Thanks for the note. Remember that Karen reads all my mail so don't send 
anything too personal. Time to get back into studying. It will be over before 
you know it and the four years is a small fraction of your working life so 
keep at it. 

I will look into London for your spring break. Send me the exact times you 
have off. Love Dad.
