     AMERICAN SOCIETY OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS  
     OFFSHORE MECHANICS AND ARCTIC ENGINEERING.

     OMAE ? Houston Chapter 

November 13, 2001 Dinner Meeting

Subject:	MEETING THE CHALLENGES OFDEEPWATER MOORING
Speaker:		Robert E. Ettle
		Vice President of Engineering - SEACOR Marine


Gulf of Mexico moored drilling units have moved from water depths of 
2,600 feet in the 1980's to over 6,000 feet by now.  This evolution 
has involved enhanced drilling units with combination wire-chain 
moorings, wires inserted into mooring legs, pre-laid mooring legs, 
and new, enhanced offshore support vessels.  Moored drilling in far 
greater water depths is expected.   SEACOR Marine's experiences in 
meeting these challenges in the Gulf of Mexico are described.  
Discussion will include engineering characteristics and operational 
capabilities of the latest generation of Anchor Handling Vessels.

MR. ETTLE served on five U.S. Coast Guard Cutters; of these he 
commanded three.   His Coast Guard shore assignments included search 
and rescue, oceanographic research, and port security.   Mr. Ettle 
worked for a succession of offshore drilling contractors, first as a 
Rig Mover and subsequently as a Manager of Marine Operations.  In the 
latter position, he was responsible for the worldwide mobilizations 
of drilling units for major offshore drilling contractors.  Since 
1997, he has been Vice President of Engineering for SEACOR Marine, an 
operator of over 300 offshore support vessels.  

MR. ETTLE holds a BS in Engineering from the U.S. Coast Guard 
Academy, a MS in Oceanography from the Naval Post-Graduate School, 
and an MBA from Kent  State University.
