At Comdex Fall 2001 IT Trade Show

Treo Talk
Last time, we talked about how the new Treo? communicator <http://r.4at1.com/c/e/r/r.jsp?rid=141.1661.7074.28465.3278.233.34125625> lets you stay in touch when you just can't talk on the phone. This week we'll look at how it lets you surf the web-without wires.

	
Bandwidth on the Run
For most people the experience of "surfing the web" wirelessly has been more akin to wading in the shallow end of a pool. Even when you're able to access one of the select few websites that have been optimized for WAP (wireless application protocol), tiny mobile phone screens often mean endlessly scrolling through blocks of text one small line at a time. The Treo communicator changes all that.	
  <http://4at2.com/email_domains/hag/0001/final/images/spacer.gif>	
The Treo communicator comes loaded with Blazer? 2.0 <http://r.4at1.com/c/e/r/r.jsp?rid=141.1661.7074.28465.3279.233.34125625>, the latest version of Handspring's award-winning web browser for the Palm OS
. Blazer lets you securely view virtually any HTML, cHTML or WAP web site in its entirety-with full text and graphics formatted to look great on your Treo screen. So the content you see on your Treo communicator is the same as what you would find on your desktop computer. Plus, you can bookmark up to fifty sites, so the information you want the most is always at your fingertips.	   <http://4at2.com/email_domains/hag/0001/final/images/spacer.gif>	 <http://r.4at1.com/c/e/r/r.jsp?rid=141.1661.7074.28465.3280.233.34125625>

Take movie listings, news headlines,and shopping deals with you, on-the-go. <http://r.4at1.com/c/e/r/r.jsp?rid=141.1661.7074.28465.3280.233.34125625>	 
  <http://4at2.com/email_domains/hag/0001/final/images/spacer.gif>	
Even if you've never accessed the web from a mobile device before, Treo makes it easy to see why you would want to. Imagine having instant access to a map when you get lost on the road. Or checking a stock quote during a power lunch. Or reading the top headlines on your way to work. Or buying movie tickets on the way to the theater. The Treo communicator lets you do all this and so much more-wherever you are.

Tips & Tricks
Cutting out just a few little steps now can save you heaps of time in the long run.

	
Customize Your Synchronization
You can shave time off your HotSync operation by only synchronizing the programs you actually use. Don't use the Expense application? Never read your email on the road? Don't waste precious synchronization time. Just open the Palm Desktop, choose the HotSync drop-down menu, and click Custom. You'll get a list of all the applications that synchronize. Simply change the ones you no longer need from Synchronize the files to Do Nothing and you're ready to start saving time!

Set Time Dialogue Box
When you're setting the time of an event with the Set Time dialogue box, you don't have to navigate up and down the vertical hour and minute bars. You can just tap the Start Time or End Time box and use your Graffiti pad to enter the times.

Write Stuff
With over 11,000 Palm OS applications just waiting to be downloaded, there's literally no end to the ways you can use your Visor handheld. Find out how reader Matthew S. used his to calculate complex traffic problems for Calgary's Transportation Department.

Visor Gets the Green Light

This summer I had the privilege of working for the Transportation Department of the City of Calgary here in Calgary, Canada. One of the projects I aided was a study into the start-up delays of vehicles once the traffic light turns green. There can be as much as a five second delay between when the light turns green and the rear axel of the first vehicle in the queue crossing into the intersection. This delay must be taken into account when trying to establish a value for the number of cars that can make it through a light in an hour of green time. This value, in turn, is used in many intersection decisions. 

Our task was to determine how many cars would make it through the intersection in one hour of green time (one hour of green time is the sum of the green times during each red, yellow, green phase until they total one hour). For this study, I downloaded a program SportsWatch v1.4 <http://r.4at1.com/c/e/r/r.jsp?rid=141.1661.7074.28465.3290.233.34125625> onto my Handspring Visor Deluxe, which allowed us to record every car crossing, something that would have been impossible with a simple stopwatch. It allowed us to time the crossing of the rear axel for every car in the queue, since when you hit the 'lap' button, it records the time elapsed and outputs it as text. From here, it is a simple matter of copying the results to a memo in memo pad and saving.

Back at the office, we were able to synchronize the Handspring Visor with the Palm Desktop software and the memos containing the information were suddenly digital documents, with no laborious data entry needed. The results could be cut and pasted into a simple MS Excel spreadsheet to be analyzed and used in our study. This made for a more complete dataset, and hopefully more credible conclusions. As well, the cumbersome task of entering the recorded data was avoided by utilizing the quick and simple synchronization system, saving us a considerable amount of time. The Handspring Visor helped to make the data collection process more complete, easier to accomplish, and more efficient to import after collection.
