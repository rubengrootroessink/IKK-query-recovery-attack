You may be interested in the attached press releases which Viking has
issued over the past few business days.

In these uncertain times, a healthy balance sheet, a solid team of
talent, performing properties, and a proactive hedging program all
contribute to Viking having a stable cash flow and distribution forecast
through the year 2002.  Viking is well positioned to realize on
opportunities, as they may arise in these periods of volatility.  In
managing the assets of the Trust through all phases of the commodity
price cycles, we continue to focus on the current yield and long term
return objectives for Viking Unitholders.

Regards,  akp
