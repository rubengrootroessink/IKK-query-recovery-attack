Treo Talk 
***************************************************************************** 
Welcome to Treo Talk, a special section of the 
Handspring e-newsletter devoted entirely to keeping 
you informed about our brand new product, the 
Treo(TM) communicator. During the next few weeks, 
we'll bring you behind-the-scenes looks at its 
development, stories from the Treo design team, a 
sneak peak at some features and a whole lot more.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
The Road to Integration 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
The concept isn't new. If you carry around a mobile 
phone and an organizer, you've probably wished 
someone would figure out how to combine them both 
into one small device. Now imagine if you also had 
to carry around a pager or a messaging device. Do 
this for a while and you'll understand the benefit 
of putting all three into one package. 

But successfully combining these devices involves 
much more than simply fitting them all into a single 
unit. Sure, you might get a good phone, but probably 
at the expense of a decent organizer. That's because 
the individual needs of these devices are in 
constant conflict with each other. A good mobile 
phone needs to be small, but organizers and web 
browsers need to have reasonably-sized screens to 
get the job done. And a numeric keypad is great for 
dialing numbers, but challenging for text entry. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
No Room for Compromise 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
These were some of the challenges the Treo design 
team faced when they started creating this product. 
The team wanted a device that looked and felt 
comfortable as a phone, but also worked perfectly 
as an organizer and wireless data device. 

"Other products that have existed in the past have 
been compromises," explains Jeff Hawkins, co-founder 
of Handspring and inventor of the PalmPilot(R). 
"You've had to trade off some of the main features 
to get the combined device. Our goal with Treo was 
to find a no-compromise solution."


----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Powerful Possibilities 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
The team began to consider everything that was 
possible in a combined phone and organizer that 
could not be achieved with stand-alone devices. And 
what they found was often times surprisingly 
powerful. The result is a device that actually 
improves upon each of its individual components 
through a variety of unique features.

"The thing about Treo," Hawkins says, "is that it's 
small enough to be a phone, and yet it's improved 
upon the phone and it's improved upon the organizer 
and it's added wireless data capabilities that no 
phone or organizer has ever had. And by combining 
them all together, you basically have a smaller 
product that does more than either one does 
separately." 

In the weeks to come, we'll show you some of the 
unique features that resulted from this successful 
integration, along with the thinking that went into 
them. You'll get an in-depth look at what happens 
when you take a phone, an organizer and a 
messenger--add wireless Internet capabilities--and 
successfully combine them into one powerful device 
that does it all.

Tips & Tricks 
***************************************************************************** 
You already know that To Do lets you keep track of 
those little tasks that call upon you each day. 
But did you also know that you can add even 
greater detail or organize them into different 
categories? If you didn't, you're about to find out 
how. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Adding Details to To Do's 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Once you've created a To Do item, you can still 
add more details if you need them. Tap anywhere 
on the original To Do and then tap Details at 
the bottom of the screen to bring up the To Do Item 
Details. From there you can enter its priority, 
category (see below) and due date. Then if you tap 
Note, you can enter more details, like driving 
directions and instructions.

clicking below:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Creating To Do Categories 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Always have a ton of tasks on your plate? Keep your 
To Do items organized in separate categories. To 
create a category, tap the right corner pull-down 
menu and select Edit Categories. Tap New and enter 
the name of the category (work, evening, groceries, 
etc.). Then when you create a new To Do item, tap 
Details and select the category of your choice.

Write Stuff 
***************************************************************************** 
The holidays are just around the corner, and toy 
stores around the country are gearing up. Just ask 
Visor handheld owners Kevin and Cindy of Wisconsin. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Designing the Perfect Toy Store 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
My wife and I both have Visor handhelds. She has 
the basic and I have the Deluxe. We both have the 
eyemodule1 and the VisorPhone. 

My wife is an area manager for a large toy company. 
She is based in Wisconsin and her territory includes 
Wisconsin, Illinois, and Minnesota. She uses the 
eyemodule1 to immediately capture visual examples 
of how stores in her territory should be set up and 
sends them (via the VisorPhone) to her headquarters 
in live time. For example, her bosses were planning 
a presentation and asked that she take a picture of 
a merchandiser and send it. The photo was taken in 
Illinois at about 10:30 a.m., and her corporate 
headquarters in Rhode Island had it by 11:00 a.m. 

When my wife had to be out of town on a business 
trip during our daughter's graduation from fifth 
grade, I was able to take pictures of our 
daughter's graduation and email them to my wife 
within twenty minutes of the ceremony. As you 
can see, with the addition of the modules we 
have purchased, our Visor handhelds have allowed 
us to better organize our busy lives.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif" size="2"><b>Designing the Perfect Toy Store</b></font><br>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif" size="2">My wife and I both have Visor handhelds. She has 
the basic and I have the Deluxe. We both have the <a href="http://4at3.net/KC15271645.4131.0.4628">eyemodule1</a> and the <a href="http://4at3.net/KC15271645.4131.0.4629">VisorPhone</a>. 
<br><br>
My wife is an area manager for a large toy company. She is based in Wisconsin and her territory 
includes Wisconsin, Illinois, and Minnesota. She uses the eyemodule1 to immediately capture visual 
examples of how stores in her territory should be set up and sends them (via the VisorPhone) to her 
headquarters in live time. For example, her bosses were planning a presentation and asked that she 
take a picture of a merchandiser and send it. The photo was taken in Illinois at about 10:30 a.m., 
and her corporate headquarters in Rhode Island had it by 11:00 a.m.<br><br>
When my wife had to be out of town on a business trip during our daughter's graduation from fifth 
grade, I was able to take pictures of our daughter's graduation and email them to my wife within 
twenty minutes of the ceremony. As you can see, with the addition of the modules we have purchased, 
our Visor handhelds have allowed us to better organize our busy lives.</font>
