Ladies and Gentlemen,

	The FBI and the Department of Justice have reviewed an Enron Org Chart current as of October 2001, and now are requesting individual Org Charts for your respective 	business units.

	They essentially are trying to understand the teams that work for/report in to each of you, and get a better feel for Enron's business and corporate staff functions.
	For the larger groups, your direct reports and key commercial and staff support should suffice. For the smaller groups, a more complete list of your team would be 	appreciated.

	At your earliest convenience, please provide me with a copy of the following Org Charts:

		1.	Enron Global Services - Stan Horton

		2.	Risk Management/Chief Risk Officer - Rick Buy

		3.	Enron Broadband Services - Jim Fallon

		4.	Accounting/Chief Accounting Officer - Rick Causey

		5.	Global Finance/Treasury - Jeff McMahon and Ray Bowen

		6.	Investor Relations - Mark Koenig

		7.	Enron Wholesale Legal - Mark Haedicke

		8.	Corporate Secretary/Board Communications - Paula Rieker

		9.	Enron Principal Investments - Kevin Garland

	Please call with any questions or comments.

Thanks

Ned Crady
