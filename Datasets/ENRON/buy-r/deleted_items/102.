SENATE CONFIRMS TWO SENIOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY APPOINTEES

On October 23rd, the Senate unanimously confirmed John H. Marburger III of New York to be Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). Marburger managed Brookhaven, a facility in Upton, NY, that conducts basic and applied research for the Department of Energy. He was president of Stony Brook from 1980 until 1994. At his confirmation hearing last month before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, he stated that directing research to help combat terrorist attacks and emphasizing research on global climate change would top his list of priorities.  Marburger indicated that he would urge the Bush Administration to support research across many disciplines, especially in the chemistry, engineering and mathematics disciplines. "Balance in this broad research portfolio recognizes that advances in one field, such as medicine, are often dependent on gains in other disciplines," he noted.  

The Senate also confirmed Phillip Bond of Virginia to be Under Secretary of Commerce for Technology. In that capacity, Bond will oversee technology policy, space commercialization and next-generation vehicles for the U.S. Department of Commerce. He will also supervise the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the National Technical Information Service (NTIS).  Bond had previously served as Director of Federal Public Policy Programs for Hewlett-Packard.

EDUCATION PROVISIONS ADVANCE IN LABOR-HHS-EDUCATION APPROPRIATIONS BILLS

House and Senate appropriators are moving forward on FY 2002 funding of key Department of Education math and science education improvement programs. However, their respective appropriations bills vary significantly on specific funding levels. Last year, funding for these programs was contained in the Eisenhower program's $485 million budget to fund teacher professional development, with $250 million set aside specifically for professional development in math and science. The current year's budget eliminates the Eisenhower program and consolidates teacher professional development into a broader category called "Teacher Quality."

Within the "Teacher Quality" category is a new initiative, the Math and Science Partnerships, which will provide competitive grants to partnerships of university departments, state education agencies, local school districts and others to improve math and science education through professional development and other activities. For FY 2002, the House appropriation would provide between $476 million and $635 million for the partnership initiative, compared with only $25 million in the Senate appropriation.  The difference will be settled by a House-Senate conference.

"QUADRENNNIAL DEFENSE REVIEW REPORT" RELEASED

The "Quadrennial Defense Review Report," issued every four years by the Department of Defense (DOD), is a planning document to guide changes in program direction.  A central objective of the most recent review as to shift the basis of defense planning from a threat-based model that has dominated thinking in the past to a capabilities-based model for the future. The report, compiled by senior civilian and military leaders within DOD, calls for a significant increase in funding for science and technology (S&T) programs to a level of three percent of DOD spending annually. By comparison, the Bush Administration's FY 2002 request for DOD is $343 billion. Of that amount, 2.7 percent would be allocated to S&T.

The report states, "A robust research and development effort is imperative to achieving the Department's transformation objectives. DOD must maintain a strong S&T program that supports evolving military needs and ensures technological superiority over potential adversaries."  DOD S&T activities consist of the 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3 programs.

To view a copy of the report, go to http://www.defenselink.mil/pubs/qdr2001.pdf For additional information on DOD S&T issues, contact Kathryn Holmes at 202.786.3756 or at holmesk@asme.org.

WHITAKER FOUNDATION TO PHASE OUT GRANT PROGRAM

The Whitaker Foundation, which has invested more than $575 million in biomedical engineering education and research, is continuing to phase out its grant programs to coincide with its planned closing in 2006. The goal of the foundation has been to accelerate the formation of a solid educational infrastructure at universities and a well-trained cadre of researchers and teachers by investing all of its resources over a relatively short period of time. In 1991, the foundation set a closing date of 2006 and accordingly raised its annual spending from $14 million in 1991 to between $60 million and $70 million annually from 2001 through 2005.

The foundation will continue to fund existing multiyear awards, but will no longer accept new applications for Leadership-Development Awards, i.e., large, long-term institutional awards. Four more competitions will be held for the Special Opportunity in Biomedical Engineering awards, three-year institutional awards to develop and enhance educational programs. Two more annual competitions will be held for the Graduate Fellowships in Biomedical Engineering, designed to help graduate students prepare for research careers in biomedical engineering.

DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ANNOUNCES GRANTS FOR TRANSITIONS TO TEACHING PROGRAM

The Department of Education has announced 42 grants totaling $31 million to recruit mid-career professionals and recent college graduates for teaching careers. The grants, to be issued under the new Transitions to Teaching Program, will go to school districts, states or national organizations. Grantees must ensure that the recruits receive special assistance, guidance, support, and in some cases stipends and incentives, to make teaching a long-term career. Information on the funded projects is available at http://www.ed.gov/offices/OESE/

In a related matter, the Department of Education has also awarded $5 million to the National Council on Teacher Quality to launch the American Board for Certification of Teacher Excellence. See 
http://www.ed.gov/PressReleases/10-2001/10052001e.html The Board will create a standard for teachers from non-traditional backgrounds to ensure that they will have credibility within the education system. The National Council on Teacher Quality is a nonprofit organizations affiliated with the Education Leaders Council and the Thomas B. Fordham Foundation.
