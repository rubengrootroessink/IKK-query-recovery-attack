It takes more than water and flame retardant to put out forest fires. Reade=

Jump in the Fire
=09
I am a smokejumper for the US Forest Service <http://r.4at1.com/c/e/r/r.jsp=
?rid=3D141.2342.11693.46460.5127.233.34125625> in Missoula, Montana. (For t=
hose who may not know, smokejumpers are airborne, forest fire fighters that=
 parachute into remote mountainous terrain to fight wild fires). As a Forem=
an for the Missoula Smokejumpers I manage several programs and coordinate s=
everal projects. My Visor helps me to stay on top of all that administrativ=
e work; but more unique is how it helps me on fires. My Prism was particula=
rly helpful on one fire this last summer.

=09
  <http://www.4at2.com/email_domains/hag/0090/final/images/012802parachute.=
jpg>We had a late afternoon dispatch to the Gallatin National Forest just n=
orth of Yellowstone National Park in early August-another lightning ignited=
 fire. We were flying over the scene about one hour after receiving the cal=
l. As the airplane circled the fire I noticed a couple of small spot fires =
quite a distance from the main fire. I had my Prism out with the Magellan G=
PS <http://r.4at1.com/c/e/r/r.jsp?rid=3D141.2342.11693.46460.5128.233.34125=
625> Module installed so I quickly marked a couple of waypoints as we flew =
over the spots. Within a few minutes we were leaping out of the aircraft an=
d floating down to our jump spot about a half mile from the fire. Unfortuna=
tely one of our fellow crewmembers was hurt on landing, and because no heli=
copter ambulances were available in the area, we were forced to utilize the=
 Malmstrom Air Force air rescue helicopter about four hours away. With my P=
rism and GPS unit I was able to gather the latitude and longitude coordinat=
es of our location. I had the phone number for the 40th Air Rescue Squadron=
 in my address book and thus was able to call them up direct on our satelli=
te phone and arrange for the evacuation of the injured jumper-giving them a=
ll the pertinent information, including our location.
=09
The next day I grabbed pictures of the fire with my eyemodule2 <http://r.4a=
t1.com/c/e/r/r.jsp?rid=3D141.2342.11693.46460.5129.233.34125625>. The fire =
made some impressive runs as the day warmed up making for some dandy photo =
opportunities but making for tough firefighting. Luckily, with some fast ac=
tion and hard work on our part, we were able to get the fire under control =
as the evening cooled. The pictures I captured with the eyemodule2 helped t=
o make a very complete fire report at the end of the fire.

The next morning (Day 3) I again used the GPS. We had been unable to find t=
he spots we'd seen from the airplane by gridding for them, as they were no =
longer showing any smoke. However, I was able to locate the spot fires that=
 I had marked as waypoints from the air. And it was a good thing too! Two o=
f the spots still had hot embers in them, and thus had potential to kick up=
 and burn.

Well, as you can see, a Handspring Visor Prism can be a pretty useful tool,=
 even in some pretty unlikely places. All that, and I could even play Solit=
aire when we got a chance to kick back and take a break!!
