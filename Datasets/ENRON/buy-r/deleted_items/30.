Just go up.  Got your message.  Physical is at 9:45.  Gerri Janney finally 
called me late late last night.  Her father died the day after Christmas.  
She cannot believe what has been going on here.  I don't think they 
remembered about Enron.  But of course I told her.  Stomach issues.  The 
usual.  J
