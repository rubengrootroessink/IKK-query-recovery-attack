I was wondering if you might be able to help me.  I need to finish strong
this year.  I am attempting to reach the goal of $336,000 in clothing sales
by the end of the year.  Obviously, no single client will be able to help me
do this.  So I was wondering if you might be able to help me out by giving
me the names of some qualified gentlemen or ladies that might be interested
in the type of service we offer.

Some things to consider:

We offer ready-made (off the rack) clothing as well as custom.
We offer all types of men's clothing including casual.

If you know of some mid to upper level executive women, they may have an
interest as well.

Some memory joggers:

Who is the best dressed man or woman you know?
Who do you know that likes nice cars?
Who do you know that owns their own company?
Who do you know that is successful in sales?
Who do you know that wears an expensive watch?
Who do you know that owns their own airplane?
Who do you know that might have a hard time fitting in typical clothing?

Thanks for your help!
