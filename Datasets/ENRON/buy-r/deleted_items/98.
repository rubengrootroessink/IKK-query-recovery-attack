Due to the rescheduling of the Annual Compliance Conference meeting, Compliance was obligated to partially purchase the breakfast that was planned for the meeting.

Therefore, a Continental Breakfast will be provided on Thursday, October 25th.

Food will be set-up on the 24th and 28th floors and will be served around 9:00 a.m.......so everyone bring an appetite...!!!!!
