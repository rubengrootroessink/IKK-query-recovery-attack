Oh, Scott, that is so great about your mom!!! But that is also soooo
interesting about thalidomide....I think of that drug alot here, because you
see the effects of the children here alot, well they aren't children
anymore...they are my age, but they are everywhere here.  so that drug works
on cancer?!?!?!? incredible!  does it have any side effects? (other than on
babies)

MMMM....liquid manure!  I hardly ever get that in the city!!!

I'm glad you'll be doing your business in private now!!!

By  the way, my mom finally got to see the doctor at MD Anderson yesterday.
They are going to put her in clinical trial where she'll be treated with
thalidomide (the drug that caused the deformed babies in the late sixties).
She starts that next week.  She had to promise not to have a baby!  That
should be pretty easy to live up to since she has no uterus and my dad's
been fixed!!!  Anyway, we're hoping that it slows things down, or puts it
in remission altogether.

Scott
