I can't believe you're going to put them outside!  100% of the TIME?  That
would be soooo difficult to do, I would end up letting them in, I have no
discipline when it comes them, with their sweet, sweet faces!  I do think
you are getting paid back for your lack of understanding for Barbara, it's
terrible when those kind of things come back to haunt you.

Which house is for sale, John's? Or that woman that never came outside?  Did
I tell you that they raised my tax value on the Roseland house for 2001 to
$231,000...what a joke!!! I#m sure that the purchaser will contest and win,
he only paid 190,000 and that is the fair value.  Are prices going down in
Montrose, what's the problem with the house by you, why isn't it selling?  I
would love to be able to buy a place that cheap...my land here cost $300,000
US!  The house alone here will be another $300,000 when it's
finished...incredible.  Armin has a small one bedroom apartment that he paid
$150,000 US for and we checked into selling it, evidently he bought when
prices had peaked...we'd get have that for it if we sell...so I guess we are
staying in the landlord business for now.  We just signed a new tenant, hope
she's not a problem, the others we've had were no problem.

I'm really sorry about the dog situation.  But what else can you do.  Oh,
what we do for love and lust!  I left everything and moved to Germany and
you're throwing your dogs outside.  Life has it's difficulties!

How's your mom?  What#s happening with MDAnderson?
