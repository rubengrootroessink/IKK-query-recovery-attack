BRUCE, 
            It was  a real pleasure to meet you and your friends at the dice table the last couple  of days, I am glad you had a good time as I love to hear that when guests are  here at the hotel. When you decide to come back to vegas Bruce please give me a  call to set up your arrangements. I look forward to hearing from you  soon.     Take Care!!!
                                                                           VINNY
