Well, how was your weekend?  Sunshine?  MUST BE NICE!! We still had cold,
rainy weather all weekend, but today we have SUNSHINE!!! AND our workers are
actually installing OUR plumbing!  AND we are taking a TRIP!!! They say good
things come in 3's, so I guess I have gotten my allotment.  Armin booked us
on a flight to London for Friday morning, returning Tues night.  We are
going to stay with Heather.  This is our first trip anywhere since the
wedding last May.  Since she hasn't been there but a few weeks, we can take
in all the sights together.  Now just have to find a dog sitter.

Armin and J?rgen installed all the electrical for the guest room and 2 doors
in the breakroom and bathroom over the weekend, so finally we are
progressing on the house...THANK GOD!

Well, can you believe it...my Melissa is 24 today.  incredibly.  And Tory
will be 6 on Sat! They are all doing good still, I am so happy for them that
things have worked out so great.

How is it going with your Mom?  Any luck with MD Anderson yet?

Well, gotta run...we are picking up some more doors this afternoon.
