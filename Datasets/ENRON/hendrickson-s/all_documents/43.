I gave up on the messenger thing.  The msn totally screwed up my
computer..it said I didn't have enough space or something like that then it
sent a print job to my computer that printed 40 pages with 1 or 2 symbols on
it.  It's over.  Armin will have to work on that shit.  When he has time and
is back.

I can't tell how big the house is right now.  I thought it looked small from
the inside, but I thought that about the office too and now that it's
finished I realize that the office is 2 x's as big as the one at the
Scharnberger's..it's huge.  I think the house is a little bit less than
3,000 sq ft of living space, mostly on the ground floor.  Remember we have
an acre of land to fill up.  But when you stand inside it doesn't seem big
at all!  On the ground floor is the master bedroom/bath, guestroom/bath,
foyer (and it IS HUGE), kitchen, dining, living room, utility room and walk
in pantry.  The second floor has a bedroom/bath, archive file room, and a
galary (that's what's behind most of the windows on the second floor).  The
rooms are not big (I don't think).

Now the warehouse IS BIG.  I drive my car in there and do circles.  But
Armin will eventually fill it up.  The I will use my private garage, it's
big enough for a work truck and my car.  Just want it all finished!!!!
