The Party date has been set...Next Wednesday at Noon we will have the German
Traditional Roof Party and you are all invited!

This party takes place when the framework for the roof is completed.  The roof
meister gives some kind of speech and we take a cut tree for him to put on top
of the roof...i think.  The only roof party that I have ever attended, the
roofer fell off the roof just as the party was to start, this roof was 3 
stories
high!  So the party never got off the ground, the emergency medical helicoptor
did eventually get the very broken but not dead roofer out of the cellar 
ground
and I never got to see what really should happen (we were just glad the roofer
wasn't dead).

HOPEFULLY, our party will be much less eventful...our house is only 2 stories
high and there is no cellar!

But at noon on Wednesday we will have beer, bratw_rst, bread, sekt and other
beverages for all to enjoy!  Hope to see as many of you as possible there, for
those unable to attend... we will send photos!

Connie, Armin and Angus
