No, I can't say that Argentine beef is better than American, but it IS
better than German (they just can't grow OR cut a cow right over here)!

Yeah, I used ChemLawn on my house in Copperfield, and they said once it's
dry it's fine for the dogs, and I did have a really nice yard...but I think
that was after I stopped them and started using Rob Townsend...anyway my
garten now SUCKS!  It'S FULL  OF CRAPP, lumber, building stuff and a huge
crane that just won't go away!!!

You really would like the movie we saw, maybe it will come there with
untertitel in English, but you would understand it in Deutsch...it's about
an Experiment that was done, I think at the Univ of Cal.  They took 20
people, made 10 prisoners and 10 their guards..in reality they had to stop
the experiment after 7 days because things were getting out of control...in
the movie they carried it on further..it was great!  Very intense, very
blooooody in the end!

I can't BELIEVE that you stayed home for St Patty's!  I watched a
documentary on Ireland and St Patty's and now I understand why it's a bigger
celebration outside of Ireland than in Ireland.  I have a great new channel
on my satellite, the English Travel channel...IT'S GREAT!  They have all
kinds of shows on countries all over the world, AND IT'S IN ENGLISH!!!

That's terrible that someone tried to pull up your plant, do you remember
that they stole a clay pot of dirt from me over there, incredible!  No, here
we don't have that trouble...YET!  Maybe in 15 - 20 years it will come.  I
hope not.  I have such nice plants in pots outside the office and really
pretty garten art in it, it would be gone in a second in Montrose!

So what#S Happenning in NEw York for you and Julie???

I still haven't been able to do my taxes because of WELLSFARGO!!! They have
my mortgage now and I CANNOT get my 1098 from them, I have written them,
faxed them, emailed them and finally today telephoned them...I WAS ON HOLD
FOR A REP FOR OVER 15 MINUTES!!! I chewed her ass out when she finally got
on the phone and the bitch said she wasn't allowed to FAX IT TO ME!  I told
her she would not only fax me my interest for 2000 BUT ALSO THE PAYOFF,
because I would not have a mortgage at such a piece of ")o($/ company as
theirs....I did'nt mention that I had sold the house.

Everything is on track for the sale, we close on May 4th and I GET MY
MONEY...HONEY!!!!

Well it's late and I want to go home...take care..connie
