 I am now the proud owner of 4 doors and 2 EVEN have door handles and
LOCKS!!! I can actually go to the bathroom in private now.

Bad news is, it's raining again. AND the farmer just spread liquid manure on
the field beside our office.  At least the rain should help keep the smell
down, I guess???

Hope your having a good week!
