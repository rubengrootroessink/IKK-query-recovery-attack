Ok, I tried and tried to figure out how to keep the pictures attached in
this program and CAN'T!  Will you please forward for your dumb old mom those
pictures that you sent out of the house to the list above?  I know that you
are busy, just whenever you get a chance.

Love,
Mom

PS Kimme wants to see the ice skating one with Tory and Armin too.

thanks!!!
