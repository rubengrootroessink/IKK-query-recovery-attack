Well we have had our first accident at the new building...But it really wasn't
the building's fault...Armin and Lolo worked all evening installing the 
largest
of our 3 garage doors on the warehouse.  It's a really tall and wide door, so
that large trucks can pull all the way into the warehouse to unload.  Well, 
all
went well with the installation, and it was time for them to go.   Lolo closed
and locked the garage door while Armin loaded up his work truck to leave.
When Armin slammed the sliding side door shut, he somehow forgot to let go
with his left hand...so the door slammed shut with his fingers in it.  That's
not the worst, Armin had locked the door before he slammed it shut!  It was
locked with his fingers smashed inside!!!  That's STILL not the worst!  He had
already cranked the truck, so the keys were in the ignition on the oposite 
side
of the truck from where he was trapped!!!!

Thank GOD LOLO HADN'T LEFT YET!!! He got the keys and unlocked the door, 
freeing
Armin's smashed 3 middle fingers.  If he would've been alone there, as he
normally is late at night, it would've been terrible!!!

So he came home around 10:30 PM in shock with pain.  He took aspirin and was
finally able to sleep about 1 AM.  This morning he could move them, but they 
are
swollen and purple and very painful.  Of course, he won't go to the doctor, He
says that they aren't broken ? ? ? But he is in a lot of pain.  He must have
been terribly tired to do something so stupid.  He needs to take a break, but 
he
won't...hopefully when Melissa and family get here he will slow down.

Hope you all are having a safe week!
