I heard that they were looking to fill all the slots over there with
Analysts, hope they know what they are doing, at least until I get all my
stock sold!  Which is not looking good again?!?!? What's with that close
yesterday?

so HPL was sold...that means Kenny has to go too?  He should look for
another spot at ENE, Dwayne is BAD NEWS FOR HIM.  Do you think he's
prejudice against Greg too?

Are you gonna look for something else?

We'Ve had great sunshine weather this week!  But cold still.  All the bulbs
are coming up, we should have flowers soon.  I want the builder to get his
crap off my land so I can start planting!  We need grass and FLOWERS!!!

Well it#s time for lunch, we're having Greek today, stuffed bell peppers
with feta in a tomatoe sauce with rice and salad!  I'm starving!!!  Since
Claudia started working for us I'm getting FAT!  It's so nice not to do ALL
the cooking and none of the cleaning!  When you visit you will get to sample
of cooking...I think you will like it.

Gotta go, write!!!
