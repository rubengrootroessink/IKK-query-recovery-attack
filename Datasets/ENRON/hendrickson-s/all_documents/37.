OK, I am trying to forward to you the email that Melissa sent out.  It has
some pictures of the house that she took at Christmas.  As you know, I am
still learning with the software, so let me know if you don't get them!

Betreff: Pictures of Mom and Armin's house


Here are some pictures I took of Mom and Armin's new house (work in
progress).

This is of the front of the house:

This is the office and warehouse as seen from the driveway on the side of
the house:

These are of the back of the house as seen from the street:

This is the view looking out from the front door:

...and last but not least, this is Tory, JR, and Armin ice skating on a mud
puddle:
