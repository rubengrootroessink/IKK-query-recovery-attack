I have returned from Egypt. We had a great time. The weather was great and
the tour was well organized. But, it is good to be back. I will write more
later. They missed me at work it looks like I will be busy for a while.

Dear mom, Bruce, and Unlce Lex,
   Greetings from an overcast and chilly Istanbul. It
is Sunday afternoon and I am back safe and sound. I
hope Bruce your travels went well.
   Yesterday morning I took a cab to the Islamic
museum and it was indeed as good as I had hoped- and
empty & cheap to boot. No problems with our Hashem
(our agent) picking me up and transferring me back to
the hotel and then the airport. I met Brandi in the
waiting lounge and it seems she too had the same
distressing reports about Doing Egypt on your own on
the cheap. She was harrassed a lot (sexually and
otherwise) and generally felt lost and unhappy a lot.
I think we definitely made the right move to do it the
way we did.
   My flight was uneventful and her boyfriend met us
at the airport and had gotten us a ride home. I had a
great homecoming. My good friend Christine from
Ireland came over and we went to a fun party given by
a gay Brit friend last night- home after 2pm!
   I got up and went to church and it was nice to see
friends there. Afterwards coffee with my friend Terry
and then shopping and relaxing here. My home is fine
and Sultan is happy to have me back. What a super
vacation! I am relaxed and energized. Have already
done a load of laundry and soon will do yoga.
   Great to hear from you mom from the boat and hope
you have a great time. Nice that you arrived to find
flowers from the Millers. Enjoy!
    Bruce I suppose you could copy this letter to send
on to mom. I assume you got the same email I did from
her on the boat.
    I love you all- gillian
