I was out sick yesterday, and was in the bathroom when you called (taking 
care of one end or the other!), then I passed out soon thereafter.  I feel 
much better to day, and am at work.  I'll take a raincheck on the food until 
tomorrow or Thursday (whichever works for you).

Julie  :-)

Where are you?  I was offended when you didn't return my phone call 
yesterday!!!

I'm volunteering to go eat seafood with you if you're interested :-)~  (Not 
at the super expensive place, though.)

You have to see my two walls, too!!!
