Well, I think there is a light at the end of the tunnel...but not soon enough
for Armin.  I am afraid he is not going to make it to the end of the week, his
parents have him soooo stressed out.  I won't even go into what all they are
doing to him, you wouldn't beleive it!

Claudia, our housekeeper, is WONDERFUL! She has us all cleaned out and
organized, IT'S GREAT!  I don't have to do a thing, no vacuum, no laundry, no
cleaning, no ironing, nothing!!! AND  she's a great cook!  Right now she's
cooking my favorite...schweinebraten with klo?e and sauce!  She makes enough 
for
lunch that we can have it in the evening if I don't want to cook.  I am 
getting
spoiled rotten and I love it!  She's also very good company, alot of fun.  I
can't wait until we are all at the new building, all moved into the house too.

The carpet man is at the building now putting down the glue stuff that the
carpet sits on for the office, the carpet comes tomorrow!  Then we can start
putting furniture in!  I have already packed up all the files that I could and
those boxes are in the archive room at the new office.  The phone gets turned
on, on Friday!  I will have a direct number to my desk, I think it's going to 
be
991199119, I have 50 to choose from and I think I like that one.  Then for the
private house 991199111.  Armin and Lolo have to program the system this week,
they don't always have alot of luck when they tackle this task...cross your
fingers for them!  Armin needs something to go smoothly for a change.

Today we received our first payment from a customer!  It's so exciting to
finally make some money from all the work Armin does!  I hope it keeps coming 
in
and the stock market keeps going up and the Euro down!  Then we can finish the
house!!!  I still still don't know the date for when that will be, I hope in
another month to know more.  Armin wants to do so much of the work himself 
but I
don't know when he has the time. J_rgen, Lolo, Mitch and John all have been
helping him.

Our highs here are not hitting 30o F.  But at least it's dry, the snow is gone
and there isn't ice on the streets. Have ya'll warmed up there now?   Our
coldest temp this year was like 16oF and I didn#t like that but at least it's
dry.

Well, Claudia said lunch is ready, so gotta go for now!  I will try to do 
better
on my emails I haven#t been sending many lately to anyone!  Hope you are
well!  (Got any gossip???)

Love,
Connie, Armin and Angus
