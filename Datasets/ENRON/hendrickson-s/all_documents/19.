I know I'm a little late, but the wishes were there for you when we toasted in
the New Years here!

We got Melissa and family off to the airport yesterday morning, then headed 
into
the office for our 1st day as business owners...I won't even go into how bad
that afternoon was, I don't have the energy right now.  But even when things
were at their very lowest, and GOD KNOWS THEY WERE!! there was a wonderful
silver lining, NO IT'S A GOLD/DIAMOND LINING!!! Claudia!!! She is the greatest
maid/cook on the face of this earth!  I came home to a beautiful spotless 
house
yesterday and to a great cooked meal today and ALL I HAD TO DO WAS GO TO
WORK!!!! Can't beat that!  I don't have to tell her anything!  She#s been
feeding me for over 5 years, so she knows just what and how I like stuff and
she's an immaculate housekeeping!  To top it all off, she's good company too,
a real cut up.  Can't wait until you get to come taste her cooking!

But things aren't looking good for getting the house finished for April.  We
have so much work with the business right now that Armin doesn't know how he
will have time to work on the house.  We are really lucky, alot of companies 
are
in bad shape because they have no work, and the business comes first.  He is
making time to get the office finished.  Tonight Lolo, Mitch, and J_rgen are
helping him.  The painter is to come Fri morn then hopefully carpet the next
week!  I have reached the TOTAL EXPLODE STAGE WITH BOTH HIS PARENTS.  Like I
said I can't even go into right now....

So what all did you do over the holidays?  We had a really nice time with
Melissa and family and they did make it home ok this time.  We had snow, so 
Tory
was happy.  But today it warmed up to 50F??? Weird weather.

Write when you can!
