That I am my friend, still smackin' the goods to the company's elite!! 

Didn't ECT go out of bizness a few years back?

I moved over here last month after much soul searching and a little divine 
intervention; I got out while the gettin' was good (and there was still 
something to get out of)   Remember, there are no layoffs in the Champagne 
Room...
  
So now I'm toiling away on the power desk, Commodity Risk Management to be 
exact.  Currently, I take the wholesale curves and massage them to  capture 
more of the physical risk associated with the retail bizness (cong., losses, 
ancillary etc.)  A commercial role no doubt!!  And last week I learned how to 
schedule power in California--take that to the cocktail party and stretch 
some honnies yessir!!  i thought the'd never give a brotha the busbar...

BTW--either you are really early for Easter Bunny decorations, you've 
expanded on your rainbow welcome mat, or you are seriuosly remiss about the 
Christmas decorations (or worse, a party I missed inviting myself to?!)  
What's up with that?  How is everything else going?    How's Julie these days?
Did you ever get those peppers to grow?  God be willing, I'll have some 
chilis, serranos, and habaneros to trade this summer.  Aye Poppeeee!
Anyway, keep in touch, with others that is.
