The status is DEAD!  Armin hasn't even had time to approve bills.  And it
totally screwed up my printer when I messed with it.  It will be several
weeks before Armin will have time to look at it.  We have so many jobsites
going right now, it's incredible!  He starts running at 6 and doesn't stop
until 11pm.  I'm sure it is easy to someone that understands what the hell
the computer is saying, but even Armin is not sure about the german version
of what the computer is saying.

How is Bean?  Did his eye get ok?  Does he stay outside all night alot?  And
he doesn't bark??? to come in??
