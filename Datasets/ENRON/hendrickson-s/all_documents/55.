Haven't heard much from you..are you vacationing???  Are just having a big
Valentine's celebration?  I'll be lucky if I get to see my husband for
Valentines!  But I did get roses...from the HOUSEKEEPER!  She's so sweet.

Well the "Control" police hit me again today...but this time only one.  He
was checking out our german workers, to see if they were "illegals".  It's
so funny, they KNOW I'm not german, but there never question my legal or
illegal status.  It's because I'm American.  If I spoke with an Eastern
Europe accent, they'd be all over me.  Prejudices are world wide.
Obviously, there are either toooo many of these police or tooo little work
for them to do to keep bothering me.

So what's your Valentine plans???
