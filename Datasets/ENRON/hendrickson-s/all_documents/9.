Just read a story in DMN about the high gas prices. Some guy named Palmer
from Enron quoted "we love volatility" Chemical businesses shutting down and
selling their gas and power back and making more than if they stay open. I
hope you have been making money.

It is cold here, below 20 last night. My trip to CA is delayed until Sunday
night right in the middle of the Cowboys game.

I guess you heard about Colby Freeman transferring to ACU. I so wanted to
see him run the ball. But, now we are committed to the forward pass.
