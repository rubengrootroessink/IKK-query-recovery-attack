Well, Armin made it back all in one piece from his ski trip.  He said that
it was a good trip, but the sun didn't shine the whole time.  He said that
the hotel was full of Americans!  And that most of the service people in the
area were either Canadian or American.  They didn't even speak the language,
only english...which is no problem for Armin now.  (The language in
Switzerland is supposed to be german so he was ok either way!)

He brought back a brochure, but forgot to take the camera.  It looks
beautiful!  We all have to go sometime...even the brochure was in german and
english.  It was just 6 hour drive from here too.  Of course, It was only
like 4 to Austria and I liked it really well and it was cheaper.

We had a blizzard here while armin was gone. About 1 foot of snow in 24
hours.  Angus and I made a snowman bottom.  We couldn't pick up the second
ball to make a man.  I have never seen snow stick like this did.  I made a
small ball with my hand at the table in the garden and rolled it up to the
door and back (that's like a total of 12 feet)...there was nothing but grass
left where I had rolled it and the ball was bigger than I could reach
around!  I hope that was the last snow of the year!  I'M READY FOR SUMMER
AND VACATION!!!

Hope you all had a great weekend!

Love,
Connie, Armin and ANgus
