Can you email me the info on AOL here to my office?  I emailed it from home
yesterday, but for some reason it takes 2 to 3 days for my email to come
here from home!  weird!  I'm here most of everyday 7 until bedtime.  I love
our office!  Can't wait until the house is finished!o!!! someday.

That's great!!!  I hope you don't get thrown in a German prison!!!

On the AOL thing...I keep it on all day at work and talk to several
customers that way. So if you're on in the evening there, I'll be on here.

I'll write more later...but get that set up!!!

Scott
