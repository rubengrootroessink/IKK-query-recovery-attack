We went to dinner with some friends, Udo and Annette, to a new restaurant
here....
The Outback!  It was the same building inside and out as in Houston...even
the same kind of parking lot!  We got there at 6, we had movie tickets for
8, and it was exactly the same as in Houston, an hour wait at the bar!  The
menu was the same and some were in English, some were in Deutsch, we had a
bloomin onion and steaks (they were from Argentina though)  Armin even got
his frozen margarita!  We had a great time, the place was full of Americans.
It was so different from german restaurants.

We saw a german film afterwards, The Experiment, it was very intense, but
good.  (Scott you would like this one). The theatre was really nice, just
like an American Cineplex.  But the film was in German.  It made us feel
like we were back "home".

Hope you all had a good St. Patty's!
