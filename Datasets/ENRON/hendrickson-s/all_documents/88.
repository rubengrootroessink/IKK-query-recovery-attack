That's terrible about your mom.  It sounds like she will have a very rough
road ahead.  I am so sorry.  We will be praying for her.  It must be
terrible too to have to wait to get into MD Anderson.  Please give her our
best and keep us posted, I am not familiar with that kind of cancer.

I'm glad you were a winner in Vegas.  When's your next trip?  We arrive in
Houston on July 4th, then go on the family vacation July 9 - 15 and depart
Houston on th 18th.  We were hoping to get together with you all the friday
after the 4th (the 6th??, I think).  Just let us know!

We have just spent the whole morning trying to install the wiring in the
walls of the break room for the internal vacuum system.  You have to run the
wires thru the plastic pipes that are in the walls and sometimes, like today
they just want go...so Armin had to destroy some of the wall.  It should
have only been an hour job, but it turned into 5 hours!  All of our workers,
except Claudia are on vacation this week, so we are trying to get some work
done on our house.  there's so much work and sooooo little time.

Now it's time for lunch...write when you can!
