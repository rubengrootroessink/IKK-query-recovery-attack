Yeah, I finally got your birthday message last night.  Figured you were
partying!  So what did you and Julie do over the weekend?  Were you batching
it?

We're doing fine.  Armin has his first boondoggle this week, ski trip to
Switzerland.  Not bad for his first.  I'm missing him already, we haven't
been apart for over 10 hours in 2 years.  weird, but I can't get enough of
him!

Well gotta go work some now...write me!
