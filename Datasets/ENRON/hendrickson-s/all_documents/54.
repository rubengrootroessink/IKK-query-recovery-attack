Dear Mom, uncle lex and bruce,
   Hi from a chilly rainy Istanbul. Yes, I am back to
the land of no sun- very overcast. Sunlight was so
nice in Egypt. I can hardly believe I was in Cairo
just a few days ago.
   Had a good day back at work. I was complemented in
front of my peers for my work on the web site- my
journal excerpt and the photos. Everyone is pretty
impressed. Nice to get positive feedback. My job
doesn't provide a lot of that. (Have ya'll seen the
slide show and read my journal on the through the Isik
web page? I sent out a mass mailing a while back with
a link to it)
    I forgot about a conference I am presenting at is
this very week! I am presenting with three female
teacher friends (two other Americans, one turk). I
wrote a long poem for my part and tomorrow we do a run
through in front of our peers at Isik. Anyway, I am
off to Ankara hopefully on the romantic luxurious
night train Wednesday evening, probably express bus
back for Saturday night. WIsh me luck.
    Nice to get back to my routine. Picked up the
Michaelangelo book again at the gym and made a big
salad.
  I love you all- gillian
