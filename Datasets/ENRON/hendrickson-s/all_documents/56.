We'd love for ya'll to come visit!  My family vacation is in July, so we are
planning on comig to Houston around the 4th of July and leaving July 18, so
either the first part of our trip or the last we have to hook up.  Armin's
dying for Cafe Adobe!!! And a relaxing vacation.  The rest of the year we
are here, until Christmas...I want to spend that back in the states
(hopefully).

I have to tell you what Angus is doing..he cracks me up!  He loves to
sunbathe, back when we were at the apartment and the sun would come out, he
would ask to go outside and sit in a chair on the front porch (of course he
would wait until I put a cushion in it).  Well here at the office the sun
comes in the south window most all day, he loves it.  But he has a problem
in the morning when it is only shining on the west wall.  so each day he
goes over to the wall and starts tapping on it with his foot!  Like he can
bring the sunshine down on the floor to him!!! Then he stares at me to fix
it!!!  He's so entertaining!

So who were you partying with on Tues?  What's Greg McClendon up to these
days?  Does he ever do anything with you or Julie anymore?  I never hear
about him.

Well, back to work for a while!
Later..connie
