I just tried to enter all my email addresses into the office computer.  This
is a different program than I had used at home and I am guessing as to what
I am doing????  IF you receive this email, will you please answer back so
that I know if I was succesful with not only entering the correct addresses,
but also in sending this email.

THANKS!  HOPE YOU HAVE A GREAT DAY!  connie

PS, This is what a german company CFO does...EMAILS!
