Well....I don't expect that any of you will attend...BUT I want you to know 
that
you are INVITED and we wish with all our hearts that you could be here.

As far as how long before we are in the house...well that depends on the 
market,
you have to remember that I am paying for all of the personal part of our
building with MY money.  The house will be 100% paid for, that's the German 
way.
 Yeah, that makes me sick but that's how it is...so I think we are looking at 
an
end of March move in...time and money will tell.  All of the big costs will be
covered by the end of the year, the only thing left is the finishing stuff,
marble, tile, wood floors, stairs, paint, wallpaper...hopefully only a few
hundred thousand more of cash, hopefully!

I Just left the building and I LOVE IT!  They put the windows in the office,
workers break room, warehouse, and our personal garage...I love them, and 
that's
a great relief, I had NO idea how they were going to look, the german way is
custom for each window and NO examples...I told Armin what I wanted and he did
good!

I could just stay there for hours looking at it all!  Can't wait until you can
come visit!
