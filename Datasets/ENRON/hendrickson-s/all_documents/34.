My office email experience hasn't gone without some gliches.  I told Armin
that something really strange must be going on because I was getting emails
from some of you and not from all of you.  I told him it seemed like some of
my emails were, in fact, MUST be missing.  He blew me off like I didn't know
what I was doing (which is mostly correct).  BUT that's beside the point,
then last night after dinner he confessed that his office computer was
probably taking my emails before I got a chance to download them!  The
thief!  So if I seemed to be ignoring some of your emails that's because I
wasn't getting them.  Armin had his on automatic download, I made him turn
that off...THIS IS MY TURF!  Now I will received all emails first.  Write
me!
