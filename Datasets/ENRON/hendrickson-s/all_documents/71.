Yes - you have a hotel room with me (can you handle that!?!?!), but it will 
not be at the Four Seasons...

That would be fun...is your hotel taken care of through the weekend???  I 
have an old unused domestic ticket that I may be able to apply to New York.  
Maybe I could even take Friday off....
