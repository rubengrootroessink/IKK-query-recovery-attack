Ok, i tried all day yesterday until 8 pm.  I was hoping that armin would
have some time to look at it with me last evening, but he was too busy with
work, so I went home.  I tried again today..no luck.  Maybe I have a
firewall or something?!?!? you know I hate this kind of crapppp....it all
should just WORK!

We had snow again this morning, but not too much, looks like someone
springled powder sugar on everything.  I'm ready for that to stop.  But at
least I didn't have to scrap ice off the car this morning!  I wish I had
just one of the garages at the apartment that I have here!  I think You
could easily park 10 cars in the warehouse!  I push the button drive in and
do circles!  But Armin will soon fill alot of it up with that work stuff of
his.  He has my private garage full of insulation AND the automatic opener
isn't installed yet...he has sooooo many projects to do!!

I have a wonderful husband but I have the MOTHER IN LAW FROM HELL!!! She has
pissed everyone off so bad that she can't find anyone that will except a
vacation in Greece with her.  Everyone that she has taken, she has worked
them to death and NO ONE is willing to go with her again.  I can't begin to
tell you how trully horrible this woman is!  And the worst part is... IT'S
ARMIN'S MOTHER!  It makes him so sad that she is so terrible.  Do you have
any in law problems?  Do they know you and everything?  I sure wish I didn#t
know mine.  Or they could just move permently to Greece, that would be good.
Do your parents know Rayfael?  How are you parents?  Please tell them hello
for me!

Well, gotta work some more!
later,
Connie
