Dear Rayfael-

I did get in contact with the head of our research group today and passed 
along your resume.

For your information, his name is Stinson Gibner (a really nice guy) and his 
phone number here at work is 713-853-4748.  He is the Vice President over the 
group and sounded interested in talking with you.  He said that he would call 
you and set up an "informal" talk.  The next step would be to come in for the 
formal interviews, which Scott can tell you how much fun that process is!!  I 
would suggest that you follow up with Stinson in a couple of days if he has 
not called you by then.

The entry level job in Stinson's group for someone with your level of 
education is called a Sr. Speicalist.  The pay range for this job 
classification is $41,300 to $87,600.  At this level you could come in and 
learn the financial side of the business which will help you to progress 
through the job hierarchy.

I am glad to have gotten something productive done today.  After being gone 
for a week it was a big fat mess in my office today.  To top it all off, I 
had to wait at home for over two hours for the police because my house was 
burglerized while I was in New York last week!  They just took a couple of 
rings from my jewerly box (nothing big), but they were from my trip to 
Cartegena, Columbia and cannot be easily replaced!  It's always something!!

Oh well,

Hope you have a great evening...

Julie  :-)
