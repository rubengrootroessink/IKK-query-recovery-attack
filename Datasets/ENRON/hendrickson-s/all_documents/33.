Yes, the business address is what you should use during your morning hours.
When I go home for dinner each day I check the home one then and then again
normally before bed.  But I am here at the office MUCH more than at home.
We love our office!  We have so much room and it's OURS!

About the phone number, ISN'T THAT STRANGE?? You can have a number that is 5
digits or alot more!  I don't understand how this system works in Germany.
OUr main number is area code 931 then
991191-0, we then also can have  any number between 991191-10 and 991191-50
in our system.  Our apartment number is only 97753, 5 digits??? Can you
explain it to me?? Armin can't.  But I think all handy's have the same
number of digits, 11 and no area code...i think.  I don't think anyone has a
number with less than 5 digits.
