If you yelled for 8 years, 7 months and 6 days you would
have produced enough
sound energy to heat one cup of coffee
(Hardly seems worth it)

If you farted consistently for 6 years and 9 months, enough
gas is produced
to create the energy of an atomic bomb
(Now that's more like it)

The human heart creates enough pressure when it pumps out to
the body to
squirt blood 30 feet
(OMG...!)

A pig's orgasm lasts 30 minutes.
(In my next life I want to be a pig)

A cockroach will live nine days without its head before it
starves to death.
(Creepy)

(I'm still not over the pig)

Banging your head against a wall uses 150 calories an hour.
(Do not try this at home .. maybe at work)

The male praying mantis cannot copulate while its head is
attached to its
body. The female initiates sex by ripping the male's head
off.
("Honey, I'm home. What the....")

The flea can jump 350 times its body length. It's like a
human jumping the
length of a football field.
(30 minutes...can you imagine??)

The catfish has over 27,000 taste buds.
(What can be so tasty on the bottom of the pond?)

Some lions mate over 50 times a day.
(I still want to be a pig in my next life ... quality over
quantity.)

Butterflies taste with their feet.
(Something I always wanted to know)

The strongest muscle in the body is the tongue.
(Hmmmmmm........)

Right-handed people live, on average, nine years longer than
left-handed
people do.
(If you're ambidextrous, do you split the difference?)

Elephants are the only animal that cannot jump.
(OK, so that would be a good thing....)

A cat's urine glows under a blacklight.
(I wonder who was paid to figure that out.)

An ostrich's eye is bigger than its brain.
(I know some people like that.)

Starfish have no brains.
(I know some people like that too.)

Polar bears are left-handed.
(Who knew...? Who cares!)

Humans and dolphins are the only species that have sex for
pleasure.
(What about the pig?)
