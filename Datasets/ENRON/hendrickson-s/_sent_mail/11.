No, I didn't see my mom for Mother's Day because they left early Sunday morning to go to New England for about 10 days.  So, I'm glad that they feel okay to travel!  We'll do something after they get back to celebrate both my birthday and Mother's Day.

My weekend was fine.  I didn't do anything exciting....didn't really feel like going out.  I did run both days and am starting back at the gym today so I can become superbuff.  I've lost 6 lbs during this whole thing at least.  Just 9 more lbs to my goal of 140.  I saw Rayfael Friday when he came over to bring me a birthday present (he didn't think I was home!)  Then I took him some stuff that was at my house yesterday and we hung out a little bit.  I'm still hoping there's a chance we can get back together, but I don't want to get my hopes up too much.  He definitely needs some time to himself and to get over this bout of depression.  I just hope that if he does, then he wants to get back together then, but I'm not sure he does.  We'll see.  I'm not interested in seeing anyone else right away, so I guess I can afford to give it a little time.  Can you put a spell on him?  hehehe

Of course, if we do get back together, that's bad news for the puppies.  If it did come to that, though, I would take them to doggie daycare during the day and they could stay outside at night - that wouldn't be so bad and they wouldn't be lonely.  Anyway, that's a BIG IF that I really shouldn't be concentrating on...so there.

How are things in Germany?  How was your trip to London?  I saw Heather in the elevator here last week, but I didn't get a chance to talk to her.

Write back!!!
