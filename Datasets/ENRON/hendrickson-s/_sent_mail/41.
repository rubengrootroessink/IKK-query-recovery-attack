i understand it perfectly!!!  it's saying the following:

I'm sorry to hear about your empoyer's relatives....it sounds like that Connie woman is really evil!  I hope she doesn't hit you anymore.  I do agree that you should put a spell on her.  In the meantime, I will think bad thoughts about her.

It's paraphrased, but you get the gist of it....

hehehe
