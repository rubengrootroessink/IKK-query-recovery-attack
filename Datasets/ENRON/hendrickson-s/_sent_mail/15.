Well, I think for now that he's not wanting to be in a serious relationship.  I don't think he ever really did, but we just ended up having one.  But I think he's got alot of other stuff going on in his life now with job and friends and feels that he can't be committed to a relationship and knows he's not going to make the effort.  I don't know if that will change anytime soon or not.  I'm assuming it won't, but hoping it will.  Anyway, I'm just super-depressed now and my birthday is tomorrow!  This will not be a birthday to remember.  :(  I really wasn't ready for our relationship to end, and didn't think it was about to, really.  So, I have to deal with the shock as well as the sadness.  I'm going to talk to him tonight about a couple of things, but if nothing is different today, I guess we'll just leave each other alone for a while and see what happens.

Scott
