Hey ---

FYI, Dan Junek quit today....he's going to Allegheny Power in NYC.  Thought you'd be interested to know.  Also, Kim's brother-in-law died this week.  They aren't exactly sure what the cause of death is yet.  So you may wanna contact her and give her your condolences.

Not much going on here, except I'm losing money hand over fist!!!  Talk to you later....

Scott
