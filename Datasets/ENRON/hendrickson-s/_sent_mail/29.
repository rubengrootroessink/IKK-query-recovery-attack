Scott, 

I just wanted to inform you that Vineyard Oil and Gas has not paid this deal for March 2001 production.  I have made several calls to speak with the lady in charge of payables.  They tell me she is never in the office, and there is no one else that is handling her duties.  I was wondering if you can speak to the trader/your contact there, so I can get this issue resolved.

Thanks,
Shielah
