Hello Scooter,

Hope you had fun on your three dates this weekend!!!  (you slut!)

You know I am jealous.  Peggy says not to spread yourself too thin!!!!

You would not believe how cheap it is here.  Today at the musuem I had a
sandwich, snickers and a cafe latte for $1.50!!!  A three course dinner last
night cost $3.00.

The bad news is that your gift cost $0.20!!  (ha, ha)  I really haven't bought
it yet.

Take Care,

Miss you,

Julie  :-)
