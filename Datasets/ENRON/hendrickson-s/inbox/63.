Good Morning Scott,
 
I need your assistance

Sitara 824147  - needs to be changed to Reliant Energy Services Inc. as the counterparty from Altrade.  

Sitara 821028 - they want to confirm again that its 'interrruptible' and not 'firm'

So are all these one day deals done with a broker 'interruptible'?  

Thanks
kf
