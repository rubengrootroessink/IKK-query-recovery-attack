More people voted for Fridays than Thursdays.  So we have decided on the
first Friday of every month at different places.  The first will be this
Friday, June 8 at around 5:30 to 6:00 at Dixie's Roadhouse on I-10 (close to
Chimney Rock if I remember correctly).

Hope to see you there.  Just in case, my cell phone number is 713-419-0111.

Whitey - send out another message to the listserve and anyone else you can
think of if you don't mind so that people will here it from someone other
than myself.
