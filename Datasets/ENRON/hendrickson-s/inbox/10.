Scott,

Things are crazy...

My nanny turned out to be Psycho (good call by the way)

The law suit is getting uglier but there is not much activity due to an ill
judge.

I missed South Beach this year...I need a break.  Let me know if Vegas is in
the works any time soon.

I hope to spend some time with our Rep in Houston this summer so I'll keep
you posted on that deal.  Here are all my numbers.
