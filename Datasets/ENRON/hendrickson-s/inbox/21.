I'm still here at the office...the customer's have my car blocked
in...sooooo...I guess I will stay awhile longer.  did I tell you that the
workers have finished installing our toilet flushing system?? We have 6
toilets and they have been set up where they can be flushed with water from
our rainwater cistern (it holds like 30,000 gallons).  cool huh, water is so
expensive here and rain is free!  Armin is talking with the customers about
doing it, but they are thinking they want to wash their clothes with it
too...i don't think that's such a good idea, the water is not purified...but
the washingmachine does heat itself, it doesn't use a hot water heater...so
I "guess" it could be ok...

Anyway...I'M BORED!!! you could write me!!!!
