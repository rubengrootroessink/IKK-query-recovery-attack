Good evening!
Here is your Money Mail for Friday, June 8.

BUZZ AT THE BELL
Technology worries and technical difficulties conspired to
send stocks lower Friday. A profit warning from Juniper
Networks deflated telecom-equipment shares, while a
computer glitch halted New York Stock Exchange trading for
more than an hour.

Late in the session, the Nasdaq Composite stood 2.2-percent
lower, down 49 to 2,215. The Dow Jones industrial average
fell 114 to 10,977 and the Standard & Poor's 500 slipped 12
to 1,265.

Shares of Juniper, which designs and sells products in
direct competition with networking behemoth Cisco, tumbled
more than 18 percent to 38.02. The company said its
second-quarter profits would disappoint investors and
announced layoffs of between 8 and 9 percent of its staff.
Cisco fell 6.1 percent and Redback Networks slid 7.6
percent to put a red exclamation point on a volatile week.

Many chip stocks also fell, partly in sympathy with their
networking brethren but also on profit-taking and lingering
fears about the future of chip demand. Intel lost 1.5
percent a day after it told analysts profits for its latest
quarter would be about what the company expected in its
last forecast. (Intel shares still finished up more than 7
percent for the week.) National Semiconductor fell 6.2
percent, but Advanced Micro Devices, Intel's biggest rival
in the microprocessor business, actually rose 2.7 percent.

Computer peripherals, cellular-phone companies and
specialty manufacturers rounded out the day's biggest
losers. Few sectors made any impressive headway. Gold
stocks jumped 4.6 percent but other gainers were up less
than 2 percent.

SCOUTING REPORT: NEXT WEEK
As punctuated by the Juniper warning, second-quarter
confession season has the market in its thrall. Keep a
close watch on conference calls and analyst meetings -- you
at least get a little warning before them. But there's no
way to brace for those pure, bolt-from-the-blue profit
warnings sure to come in the weeks ahead.

Economically speaking, inflation figures top next week's
calendar. The producer and consumer price indexes will be
released Thursday and Friday, respectively. Inflation has
become a back-burner issue, something the Federal Reserve
seems unconcerned about. But do keep an eye on
precious-metals stocks, which have risen in recent weeks
(though fallen back a bit lately). Rallying gold stocks
sometimes hint that investors are betting on an inflation
pickup.


ECONOMIC CALENDAR:
Wednesday
*Retail sales for May, forecast: +0.2 percent
Thursday
*Producer price index for May, forecast: +0.2 percent
*Weekly jobless claims, forecast: +410,000
Friday
*Consumer price index for May, forecast: +0.3 percent


STOCKS
* Intel's Visibility Only Half the Battle *
Investors applauded the chip giant's forecasting prowess
this week. But analysts say profit growth needs to pick up.
