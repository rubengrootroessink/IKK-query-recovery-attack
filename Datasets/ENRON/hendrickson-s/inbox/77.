1. LOOKING FORWARD
Our Take: Bullish In Choppy Seas

Economic and Market Outlook:

Indicators point in both directions. The economy is still sluggish and the
industries are still in pain. Though recovery in the overall economy is
still blurred, recovery in some sectors seems on its way. The stock market
turned around after the April 4 debacle, but showed considerable
hesitation to move up last month. It took a step back for every step
forward. The Nasdaq slipped 0.27% for the month of May; the Dow showed
some strength, rising 1.6% in May.

Though the bullish trend is back and we can expect to see the markets
rising further in the next few months, the seas are choppy and frictional
factors will continue to pose hurdles in the upswing. A heartening fact is
that in April, $21 billion was invested in mutual funds as compared to a
net withdrawal of $20.6 billion in March. Further, the IPO market is
finally looking up and investors are treating the new issues fairly well.

2. LAST WEEK

Economic and Market Update:

The markets edged up still further this week, though the gains were not
impressive. More bad news flooded the market and investors were hesitant
to sell.  The oil and biotech sectors were strong; the chip sector
turned in a depressed performance before shifting gears on Thursday.
Guidance from Intel Corp. (INTC) and Applied Micro Devices (AMD) that
earnings will be in line with previous expectations infused the markets
with enthusiasm.
Intel guidance: http://www.123jump.com/story.htm?story_id=11865

On the economic front, initial jobless claims for the week rose to
432,000, the highest since 1992 and productivity declined 1.2% for the
first quarter, more than the expected 0.8% decline. This was the first
fall in total worker output per hour since 1993. Unit labor costs, an
important gauge of inflation, rose 6.3%.

Fed chief Alan Greenspan has repeatedly stressed the importance of
productivity in the U.S. economy to contain inflation and spur growth,
and the economic data this week dimmed the optimism. However, in a speech
in Singapore, Greenspan reiterated that inflation was not an issue and
that the rise in crude oil prices was temporary.

Productivity: http://www.123jump.com/story.htm?story_id=11799

Spirits were dampened further when Federal Reserve Governor Meyer stated
that he expects the economy to be sluggish into the second half of the
year. His view echoed the statement by Fed Bank of Richmond President
Alfred Broaddus, that the economy may have not yet have hit the bottom
and more rate cuts may be necessary to prevent a recession.

News at the industry level also did not look good. IDC reported that it
expects U.S. PC shipments to decline 6.3% in 2001, the first annual
decline ever. The Semiconductor Industry Association said that chip sales
could fall 14% this year. Further, they felt that PC and chip sales are
expected to be anemic even in 2002.
