So what's happening today?  Are you involved in ranking stuff, like Kim?
That's all so much fun.  I think Armin and I should have a ranking meeting,
he would get some low marks in the courteous office behavior..when he gets
stressed he turns into...ISOLDE!!!! Maybe if I threaten his bonus he would
work to improve that one little imperfection.  And of course I need no
improvement in ANY catagory, I'm just perfect (I'm sure he will agree..ha ha
haaaa).  Angus would get the best rating from both of us, he is perfect in
our eyes.

I think Angus may be in trouble with the workers though...i let him out to
do his business while ago and the workers had their lunches sitting out, I'm
afraid to ask them if he helped himself to their food...he's really bad
about that!  He got on my desk one afternoon while Armin and I were outside
and dined on some M&M's that were in a cup on my desk...there were only like
5 in the cup and when we came back in, I found one partially licked one on
my desk and one on Armin's...of course he was sick that night.

We are finally getting warmer wetter again, oops that's weather in english.
I was able to take off my coat at lunch time, hopefully tomorrow the
thermals can go too.  I hope Julie has been having better weather in
Prague...but I think not.  Have ya'll heard from her?  I thought she might
call us since she's on the continent...

Did you tell her about talking to your parents?  She told me that she told
you her secret.  Were you surprised?  I actually guess who it was, but I was
surprised!  Last I heard she didn't know their status....did she ever find
out?

Well, write me!!!!
