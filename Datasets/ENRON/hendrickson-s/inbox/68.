Scott,

I emailed you the attached profile a month or so ago. At that time, you
were at NYMEX + $0.68 with a trigger. The customer is finally ready to do
something and I was wondering if you could update the price for me this
afternoon. You can just email back your quote if it is easier.

Thanks,


Thomas E. Spencer
