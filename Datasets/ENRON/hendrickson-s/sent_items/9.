Well, sounds like everything is great in Germany!  You still didn't tell me about your trip to London?

I'm still doing just "ok".  The busier I am, the better I am, so I'm trying to keep as busy as possible.

If I wasn't poor and worried about my JOB right now, I'd schedule a trip to come see you, but I have to see how things shake out here.  I need to make some money quick!!!  And yesterday didn't help!  I need a vacation!!!  You guys MUST come stay with me at some point while you're here, and I wanna have a party one night while you're here.

Well, trading's getting busy....write back and I'll write more later!

Scott
