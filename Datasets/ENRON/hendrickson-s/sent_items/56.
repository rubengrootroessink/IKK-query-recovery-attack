That sounds great!  So will they get it all spread in one day?  Sounds like everything is taking shape now!!!

Not much going on here.  I had dinner with Rayfael last night, it was a little painful, but I survived.  He's so messed up
in the head right now.  :(

Anyway, nothing too exciting happening here....at least nothing that's gonna cheer you up...

Scott

I'M SO EXCITED!!!! They are finally spreading out my land!  There's a HUGE
bulldozer out there and he's moving the dirt where-ever I tell him.  IT'S
GREAT, EARTH SCULPTING (???).  There will be some low levels, some high
levels and then some mounds...I have an acrea of dirt to play with...it's
like a great big sandbox!  I ALWAYS LOVED PLAYING IN THE DIRT!

And I am getting so excited about having a yard, ALLLLLL OUR OWN!  With no
tenants (Frau Sweetie) looking down at us.  Our only neighbor, that will
actually live on their land hasn't even started building yet.  They gave us
their plans for approval last week and they are building their house around
an atrium like area...so they won't even have any windows this way!

I needed something uplifting..I just finished calculating how much we pay
annually to the ins. company to be covered for everything....30,000 DM A
YEAR!  ONLY 14,000 is for the business!  I keep hoping that I can find
something to cancel...but no luck yet.

So what's happening???
