Guten Morgen!!!

How was your weekend?  We had the long Memorial Day weekend here....hahaha!

Things are fine here.  I just tried to relax this weekend.  Friday night I =
went to a movie with Rayfael. We saw Angel Eyes with Jennifer Lopez.  It wa=
s pretty good.  Saturday, I pretty much just vegged out a good chunk of the=
 day.  Julie and I went to lunch and ran errands.  I went running every day=
 this weekend, too!  I've lost 10 lbs since the big breakup!!!  Down to 145=
 now, may go for 140 - not sure.  I didn't go out on Saturday because I was=
 just in a mood to stay in.  Sunday, I took care of some stuff around the h=
ouse.  I wasn't really planning to go out, but one of my new friends, Kevin=
, called and wanted me to meet him and some other folks out at a bar, so I =
went at about 9:00.  Well, you know how 1 or 2 drinks always turns into alo=
t more...I ended up staying there pretty late and having a good time.  I cr=
ashed at Kevin's house and got back to mine at about 7:00 am.  So all the w=
ork I'd done on getting caught up on sleep was ruined!!!  I came home and g=
ot right in bed, but the dogs really wouldn't let me sleep much.  I went ov=
er to Julie's yesterday to get instructions on taking care of her cats this=
 week.  She leaves Wednesday for Prague and gets back next Thursday.

Now it's back to work, but it's a short week at least.  I'm getting more an=
d more used to the fact that I'm single now, and even though I'd like me an=
d Rayfael to get back together - it's nothing I'm gonna be able to push, if=
 it happens, it happens.  I really hope it does, but the best thing for me =
is not to push it.  So, in the meantime, I guess I'm a free agent!  That fe=
els weird...but, oh well.

Anyway, how are things there?

Scott
