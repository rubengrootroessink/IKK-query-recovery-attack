I doubt you will get this b4 you get back, but I'll write anyway.  Yes, I had a GREAT weekend, but I was partying way too much!!!  Went out every night from Wednesday to Sunday!!!  I'm paying the price now though.  But I had a really good time and kept very busy :).  I've been two times to your house so far.  Everything seems fine.  I saw Ellie the first time - pigging out on the canned food.  Didn't see Frankie, but I didn't look either.  The weather here has been very hot, but sunny.

Sounds like Prague is treating you well.  Is it beautiful?  Tell Peggy I'm not spreading myself TOO THIN...but remember, you can never be too thin or too rich!!!  I can't believe the prices.  And if you get me something that costs 20 cents you better get alot of them!!!  HEHEHEHE

I'll go to your house again on Wednesday before you get back on Thursday.  Sadly, the Tsunami has not been used - although there were opportunities!!!  hehehehe

Miss you!  Hurry back!

Scott

Hello Scooter,

Hope you had fun on your three dates this weekend!!!  (you slut!)

You know I am jealous.  Peggy says not to spread yourself too thin!!!!

You would not believe how cheap it is here.  Today at the musuem I had a
sandwich, snickers and a cafe latte for $1.50!!!  A three course dinner last
night cost $3.00.

The bad news is that your gift cost $0.20!!  (ha, ha)  I really haven't bought
it yet.

Take Care,

Miss you,

Julie  :-)
