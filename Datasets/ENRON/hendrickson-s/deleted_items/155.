Ladies and Gentlemen:

The Resources Subcommittee has posted Appendix 1D, "Time Error
Correction Procedures," Version 2 for Operating Committee ballot.  The
OC is will consider this Appendix at its July 11-12, 2001 meeting.

Because this document is quite short, I have attached it to this e-mail
note along with existing Version 1 for reference.  These documents are
also on the NERC web site at http://www.nerc.com/~oc/standards/
