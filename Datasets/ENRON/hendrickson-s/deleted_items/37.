Dear Collector,

Sotheby's Institute students learn about art by examining it first hand. All of our courses are led by experts in their field and include visits to museums, galleries and private collections in the UK and elsewhere in Europe.

New courses in 2001 include:

+	MA in East Asian Art
+	Part-time MA in Contemporary Art
+	Foundation Course in Asian Art
+	Jewellery Courses in London, New York and Geneva
