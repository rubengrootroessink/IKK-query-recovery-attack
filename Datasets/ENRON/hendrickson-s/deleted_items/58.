> REVIEW: 'MOULIN ROUGE' DAZZLING, ELECTRIFYING


"Moulin Rouge" is, quite simply, a spectacular reinvention of the movie
musical. It's a movie full of color, and song, and a lot of panache. All that
style doesn't always work -- and at times things get too frantic and the
editing becomes too fragmented -- but as a whole this ambitious project flies
off the screen.

> REVIEW: 'WORST THAT COULD HAPPEN?' YES, IT IS


The title of Martin Lawrence's new picture, "What's the Worst That Could

of Lawrence lumbering around in especially heavy-lidded, thick-tongued style
before the unavoidable answer strikes you: The worst that could happen is this
crummy movie.

party.
