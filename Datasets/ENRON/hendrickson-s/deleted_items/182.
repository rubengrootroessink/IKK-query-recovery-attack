Ladies and Gentlemen:

The Electronic Scheduling Collaborative (ESC) is seeking comments, from
all interested parties, on proposed OASIS Business Practices and issues
related to OASIS Phase II.

The ESC's goal is to file with the FERC, the "Standardized" Business
Practices that are necessary to support the implementation of OASIS
Phase II as required by the FERC ANOPR {Docket No. RM00-10-000}.  These
standardized business practices will be filed with the FERC on August
31, 2001.

This summer, the ESC will conduct three rounds of public comment
postings.  This is the first posting and will run from May 25 through
June 11.  The ESC will compile, and respond in general, to the comments.
The ESC responses to the comments will be posted, with revisions to the
documents, at the next round of public postings.  The next two postings
are tentatively scheduled for June 26, 2001 and July 31, 2001.

The above referenced documents are available for review, and comment, on
the NERC web site: www.nerc.com <http://www.nerc.com>.  From NERC Fast
Links, select OASIS Phase II Business Issues. Please read the Business
Issues Summary document before commenting.  Comments will only be
accepted on the comment form provided.
