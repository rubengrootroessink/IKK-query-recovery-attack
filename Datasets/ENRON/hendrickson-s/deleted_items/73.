It's easy as 1 - 2 - 3!

Step 1: Click on the link above to set up your account in minutes.

Step 2: Choose from over 4000 of the largest Market-Cap companies and Index products on the NYSE & Nasdaq.

Step 3: Caculate a monthly or weekly amount based on what you can afford -- $25 a week, $50 a month, $100 a month, whatever fits your budget. Because you invest the same amount all the time, you take the emotions of a down or up market out of the equation.

Now Relax while ShareBuilder helps you build your portfolio over time! If the price of your stock goes down, you purchase more shares. If the price goes up, you purchase less. Either way you invest at your own pace and within your budget.
