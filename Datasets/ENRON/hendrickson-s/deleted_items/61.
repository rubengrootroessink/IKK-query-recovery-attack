Dear Outpost.com customer,

As you may recall, I sent you an email about five weeks ago about the
tough times for dot-com companies and the tough times we were
experiencing here at Outpost.com. Amazingly, about 7,000 of you sent
us, well, they were pretty close to love letters, in response. Today
I am thrilled to be able to tell you that it now appears that, like
The Rolling Stones, we will indeed be here forever.

We have just announced that our friends at PC Connection have agreed
to acquire your favorite company, Outpost.com. The best part is that
we will remain Outpost.com and we will remain in our gorgeous
headquarters town of Kent, Connecticut. Thus, we will continue to do
business with you as we always have, with a deep commitment to you,
our customers, with our rather healthy sense of humor, and with the
enormous resources that will now be available to us through the PC
Connection family. And yes, the gerbil stays. We wouldn't have it any
other way.

The most immediate impact this will have on our business is that,
effective immediately, we have access to tens of millions of dollars
of inventory on a daily basis. This will help us speed your orders on
their way to you much sooner. The gerbil brought in some of his
buddies to work in the warehouse, so we now have many more hands
(paws?) available there as well.

Needless to say, we are awfully excited about this. PC Connection is
a company we have long admired, and to say that this is a good fit is
quite an understatement. So, the bottom line is that you are stuck
with us. We just won't go away and we plan on finding new and even
more clever ways to entertain you as you shop for a very long time to
come. As a matter of fact, we would really appreciate it if you could
help us name this silly gerbil as we are all getting tired of calling
him, "Gerbil". You can do this at:

Thanks again for all your support over the past six years. It has
been an honor serving you and getting to know you.


Darryl Peck
Founder, CEO & President
