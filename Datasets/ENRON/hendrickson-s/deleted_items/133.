Good evening!
Here is your Money Mail for Monday, June 4.

BUZZ AT THE BELL
Stocks shuffled aimlessly Monday in quiet trading,
eventually closing slightly higher across the board.
Neither a healthy inflation outlook from the Federal
Reserve chairman nor a bleak semiconductor sales report
seemed to excite investors.

Blue chips sported the biggest gains as the Dow Jones
industrial average rose a whopping 0.6 percent, gaining 71
points to 11,062. The Nasdaq Composite edged up 7 to 2,156
and the Standard & Poor's 500 climbed 6 to 1,267.

Overnight, Fed chief Alan Greenspan told a Singapore
monetary-policy conference that U.S. inflation is under
control, at least as far as consumers are concerned.
Normally, that would be something to shout about. But
Greenspan blunted any optimistic response by pointing out
the reason inflation remains at bay: In order to fend off
competition and keep you and me as customers, companies are
accepting slimmer profit margins instead of raising prices.

Greenspan's comments inspired an early pop that quickly
fizzled.

The other big piece of before-the-bell news -- the
Semiconductor Industry Association's April sales report --
exerted a more lasting influence, but only on chip stocks.
The SIA said chip sales slumped 4.7 percent in April from
March. In response, producers of both chips and chip-making
equipment lost ground. Applied Micro Devices fell more than
6 percent and Applied Materials lost about 2.5 percent.
Industry giant Intel was little changed, while shares of
Cypress Semiconductor actually rose, despite the company's
profit warning.

Oil-related shares rose as crude prices bubbled higher,
this time in response to more threats of supply disruption
from Iraq. The S&P oil-drilling group climbed 2.3 percent,
while the more diversified oil-and-gas group rose 1.5
percent. Triton Energy, meanwhile, surged more than 15
percent after the company announced a huge oilfield
discovery off the African coast.

More broadly, about two-thirds of S&P industry groups
tallied gains, although nothing moved particularly fast or
far.

SCOUTING REPORT: TUESDAY
Late spring can feel an awful lot like summer. A light
economic calendar and slow trickle of earnings reports
could spell -- say it with me -- quiet trading. Of course,
making that prediction leaves one vulnerable to all sorts
of surprises. So tomorrow looks slow, but that could change
with the morning headlines.


ECONOMIC CALENDAR:
*April factory orders, forecast: -2.7 percent
*Revised Q1 productivity, forecast: -0.7 percent


STOCKS
* AOL Still Spells Growth *
Most analysts like AOL Time Warner's prospects for growing
its bottomline.

* Pick of the Week: Alliant *
Alliant Techsystems may be the best defense industry stock
to buy now, analysts say.
