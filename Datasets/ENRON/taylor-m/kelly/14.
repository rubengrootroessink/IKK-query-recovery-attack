Dear Mr. Mark Taylor,
Thank you for allowing me to briefly talk to  you.  As indicated in our conversation, Mr. Ivan Byers (513-874-1113)  personally suggested that I call you about employment opportunities at  Enron.  Maybe you can forward this onto your Human Resources in the  Enron Energy Services Division.  
 
Again, please let me tell you a little about  myself:
I am a detailed, dependable, proactive, self-starting  Mechanical Engineer that began in research and development. I have progressively  moved into project management as a project engineer. I have enhanced these  management skills by learning new software while managing and tracking cost and  schedule of projects. I have managed small construction projects from inception  through completion on schedule and under cost. I am a past member of the Project  Management Institute (PMI) and have taken the Study Seminars so that I can take  the test to earn the Certificate PMP, Project Manager Professional. I plan to  sit for the PMP test next spring. I have excellent communication skills both up  and down the organization chart whether good or requiring immediate attention. I  am a team builder by teaching, training, and mentoring.
I look forward to hearing from you in the near  future,
Again, thank you,
Respectfully submitted,
Kelly M. Clark
