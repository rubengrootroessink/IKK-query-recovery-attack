Mark,
I miss this one because of the essential reuirements of seven to ten
years of field construction experience.  I have installed two new electric
boilers and one rebuilt gas boiler.  I understand the all of the essential
requirements but have very little HVAC backgroud.
Otherwise I feel pretty good about this one other than the seven to ten
years field experience.
Kelly
PS, down below this one says very clearly, PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE
RECRUITER OR HIRING MANAGER.
