Mark,
The description on this one, I feel good about.  I do not have 15 years of
field experience but do have over 10 years of project management experience.
However, item 6. INTERFACE WITH GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WHICH HAVE REGULATORY
AUTHORITY OVER THE PROJECT AND OBTAIN THE NECESSARY PERMITS. I have worked
with the State of Ohio for permits and licensing.  I know the fundamentals,
but would need some direction for the state that I would be working.
Kelly
