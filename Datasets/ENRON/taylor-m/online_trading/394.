Mark:

I am comfortable with this approach. At a minimum, it puts the counterparty 
on constructive notice of the GTCs, a copy of which I understand can be 
viewed and printed out if desired.

		 Subject: EnronOnline Transaction Confirmations

The EnronOnline team has asked if we can discontinue sending copies of the 
GTC's when EnronOnline transactions are confirmed.  They have suggested a 
sentence be added to the confirmation to the effect that it is subject to the 
GTC's which can be accessed on the website.  Any thoughts?
