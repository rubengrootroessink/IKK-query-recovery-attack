 <<Legal and Privacy.doc>>  <<Legal and Privacy.rtf>>

Further to our conference call yesterday, please find attached a revised
draft of the Legal and Privacy statement with a further copy marked up to
show the changes from the previous draft.

I have changed the trade mark wording in the first clause.  This should be
sufficient wording to identify third party trade marks used on the website
provided that you are only using those third party trade marks in order to
identify third party products and, of course, are not using them in order to
trade.

In Clause 2, I have stated that the ETA and other general terms and
conditions are available by writing to your head of legal.  As I have
mentioned before, my preference would be for the ETA to be available to a
counterparty at the time of signing the Password Application.  This would
help to avoid any potential argument by a counterparty that the terms of the
ETA have not been incorporated by reference at the time of signing the
Password Application because the counterparty did not know what it was
signing.  Nonetheless, I understand that you do not wish to do this and will
rely upon the counterparty printing off the ETA prior to clicking its
acceptance to it on the website.

Do you want the counterparties to also be able to get copies of the General
Terms and Conditions by writing to you or should this just be restricted to
the ETA?

Finally, I have incorporated changes into the disclaimer to avoid the need
for the Read Only ETA.  However, it will be important to ensure that when
allocating passwords on a read only basis, it is made clear to the
counterparty that they cannot trade on the website and that you are entitled
to terminate their access at any time immediately with or without notice.
Clearly, the read only access must allow the counterparty to open and read
the Legal and Privacy statement.

I look forward to receiving your comments on this.

Kind regards

Andrew Wilkinson
