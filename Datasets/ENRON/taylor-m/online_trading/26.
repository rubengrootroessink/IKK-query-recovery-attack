Mark,

please have a look in the "Long Descriptions" worksheet in the file attached. 
Descriptions are combined from different components defined on other pages 
per trading desk. Product lines in blue colour font on yellow background have 
been already reviewed twice, blue on white - once, black on white - haven't 
been reviewed yet.

Please e-mail/call if you have any questions or would like to have a fax as 
well.
Regards,
Elena
