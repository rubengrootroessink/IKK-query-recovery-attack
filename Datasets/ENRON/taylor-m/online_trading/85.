Mark,

Welcome back!

I am wondering if you could lend a hand on a few areas on the legal side of 
EnronOnline:

1) GTC Cross reference (see prior email)
2) Product Long Descriptions - these are now available in the same format as 
the customer will see - i.e. all put together by the system, as opposed to 
individual sentences in a spreadsheet. The traders should have set up all of 
the products which were required for the simulation (I haven't confirmed 
this). These products would be a good place to start and should provide a 
representative sample for the lawyers to look at. There are a few changes 
coming, as requested by Louise Hansen, Stacy Dickson and Janice Moore which I 
have not yet incorporated (but hope to within the next 2 days or so) - 
otherwise, the other products should be OK as they contain text derived from 
the spreadsheets which the lawyers have approved.

It would be helpful if you could organize for each of the lawyers to access 
the Product Manager, so they can see the long descriptions for the Products. 
Someone in the Product Control Group should be able to show you how to access 
the long descriptions in the Product Manager 

3) Emissions - Are you the emissions guy? I haven't actually discussed these 
with anyone - not sure if the lawyer list I have includes the person who 
should be looking after this?

4) I still do not have a warm and fuzzy feeling that the GTC variables have 
been properly cross-referenced to the spreadsheets, and that the two work 
together to form a cohesive whole. I might just be paranoid, but I think this 
area needs closer examination. Perhaps you could spot-check a couple of GTC's 
against the products and see what you think?

Thanks for your help


Dave
