Mark,

We have identified an issue in the UK whereby we could sell an Option for Q3 
(for example), which is really three 1-month options (July,Aug, Sept.). The 
option lanaguage needs to be clear that in the case of an option which has 
multiple election dates, the premium is paid up front for the set of options, 
but the payments which result from option settlement occur in each month 
during the option period.

Justin and Edmund have suggested the attached. Do you want to modify the U.S. 
product descriptions in a similar way?

Dave
