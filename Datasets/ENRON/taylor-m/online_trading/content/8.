Dan,

I didn't speak to slides 6, 9, or 14 of the original presentation sent to 
you.  I think they are bad slides so you can either take them out or leave 
them in with no audio.  If in the final review it is determined that these 
slides should stay in, I am happy to come back in and do the audio for them.  
The revised presentation is below, the original presentation is further down 
in the e-mail
