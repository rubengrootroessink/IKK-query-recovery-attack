Dave:

Attached for your review is the revised Terms & Conditions to the Reuters
Internet Services Agreement.  The agreement is redlined to reflect the text
inserted as a result of the revised transaction (i.e., inclusion of paid news
and quotes).  Lynne and I are preparing the revised order forms for the news 
and
quotes, which will include the relevant pricing and billing information.

(See attached file: Enron-Investor-T&C.dot)
Regards,

Stanford Lin
Senior Legal Counsel
