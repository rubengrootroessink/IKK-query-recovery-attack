Subject: Trademarking

We have discussed in the past the trademarking of the EnronOnline etc and now 
as we get closer to launch I would like to check up on whether we are ready 
to start this process off.  I am currently thinking that we should start this 
process of next week.  Could you let me know what your plan would be to take 
this forward.

Thanks

Louise
