I thought it prudent to invest approx. US$1000 and register "EnronOnline" as 
a trademark in Australia. My preference would be for Enron Australia Pty. 
Ltd. to  register the trademark. But I note that the Enron logo is registered 
in the name of Enron Corp. I assume this was done prior to the incorporation 
of any Enron companies in Australia. Do you know of any practice (I couldn't 
find a policy) to register trademarks in any particular Enron body corporate?
