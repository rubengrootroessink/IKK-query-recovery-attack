Harry:

Attatched is a document containg the basic structure of the auction as we 
envision it. Please keep in mind that it is a work in progress and will be 
modified as we develop a better idea of the auction.
Below are certain questions we need clarification on.

Structure:
Do we have any CFTC exposure?
By the nature of the auction structure, are we not implicitly matching? If 
yes then how does this affect the previous answer?
Do we have exposure to the lottery commission if we offer a free gift during 
the auction?

Contract:
To limit our exposure due to failure of the system etc. what sort of Force 
Majure clause can we incorporate in the contract?
To what extent are electronically signed contracts enforceable?

Internal:
Can other trading desks at Enron other than the emissions desk participate in 
this auction?
What limitations can be placed on the emissions desk as far as information 
sharing and usage are concerned? both during and after the auction?


Thank You

Zal
