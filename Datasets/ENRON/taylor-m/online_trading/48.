For you to look at before Mark  and I get up.  Mark told me he would be 
speaking to you about the alterations today (your yesterday ) so I hope they 
make sense.

Attached are revised drafts of the New York PA and ETA, which have been 
revised to reflect the latest Clifford Chance drafts and our discussion 
yesterday.  We are unable to blackline these drafts, due to the fact that the 
Clifford Chance drafts are not on our system (and we did not receive all of 
them in any event).  Also, we have not yet received from Mark's office the 
language on confirmations; we have taken a shot at it but can obviously 
modify it after we get the language.

Finally, we have attached a blackline of the "Legal and Privacy" statement, 
reflecting some suggested changes.  We also note that, if this document is to 
be "global", we will either need to decide on a single governing law or 
delete choice of law entirely.

Best regards.
