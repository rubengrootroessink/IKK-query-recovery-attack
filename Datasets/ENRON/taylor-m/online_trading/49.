David,

Further to your earlier email I am pleased to attach the following documents 
for you to draw up blacklined versions of the US versions of the PA and ETA 
you distributed earlier:

PA- version 9 that was sent to Enron on 20 July 1999, version 10
incorporating comments from the meeting between Clifford Chance and Justin 
Boyd and myself, and a mark up showing
the changes between the two.

ETA- version 7 that was sent to Enron on 20 July 1999, version 8
incorporating comments from the meeting between Clifford Chance and Justin 
Boyd and myself, and a mark up showing
the changes between the two.

Please use version 10 of the PA and version 8 of the ETA for your blackline 
for us.

Please let me know if you need an alternate format of document for your 
computer systems.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards, Edmund.
