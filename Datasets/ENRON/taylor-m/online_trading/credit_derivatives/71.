Mark,

The list below contains the 20 reference entities for the launch of credit 
derivatives on EnronOnline.  According to the emails that I have seen, only 7 
of the 20 have been completely approved by legal.  My understanding is that 
both US and London credit has approved this list.  Could you verify the 
approval status for these entities?

Let me know if you have any questions/comments.

Thanks for the help!

Frank
