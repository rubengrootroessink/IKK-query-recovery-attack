Not wishing to reply out of turn, the legal approval process for Reference 
Entities will be essentially the same for the website as for Enron Online.  
It is possible, given the tight timing, that some "finishing touches" needed 
to be put to this process after the launch of the website.  Also, Legal will 
be producing formalising the procedure (most likely by means of a checklist) 
to assist the lawyer/paralegal charged with performing the legal approval 
process. 

Also, please note that the process in London and Houston for approving 
Reference Credits is essentially the same - any difference merely reflects 
the more developed/diverse nature of the businesses in Houston and the fact 
that there are a number of General Counsels there who need to sign off, while 
there is only one in London.

I trust this helps.

Regards

Paul

Subject: Re: Names on EnronCredit.com  

It is my understanding that the EnronOnline approval process is separate and 
approval for EnronCredit.com does not automatically mean approval for 
EnronOnline.

Debbie/Mark: Can you confirm or refute my understanding?

Thanks,

Dave
