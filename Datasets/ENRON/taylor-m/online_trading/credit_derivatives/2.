Mark,

 I apologise for the delay. The developers were travelling and I had to 
literally chase them to get a response. It appears that we  do not have 
business relationships with the entities listed by you. No MOU or Non- 
Disclosure Agreements have been signed although there are discussions going 
on with a couple of entities.
