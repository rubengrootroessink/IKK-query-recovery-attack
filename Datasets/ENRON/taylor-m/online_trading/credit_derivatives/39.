Memo =20

Thanks very much for your memo Paul it is very helpful.  I attach below for=
=20
completeness the To Do list put together by Elena in order to put Credit on=
=20
EnronOnline. =20
There are two remaining issues which require further thought:-

1.  How do we want to display Credit on a long term basis on EnronOnline. =
=20
For the short term, we can put credit out there but the number of updates=
=20
will be restricted.  Using Jay's best guess on a slow network connection th=
e=20
initialization process will take upto 4 minutes and on a normal connection=
=20
250 updates every 30 seconds would prevent people from trading.   So we do=
=20
have some scaling issues? Our model doesn't really function for simultaneou=
se=20
changing of hundreds of products so really we need to actually get a much=
=20
better specific on how many updates you envisage.   Do you really envisage=
=20
that many updates?  Also we haven't yet experienced fast updates which we=
=20
will do when FX joins the system.

2.  We have approximately 4000 guest id and passwords?  Can these see credi=
t=20
pricing from a due diligence perspective.

Elena will be leaving the EnronOnline group at the end of this week and Mar=
k=20
Dilworth will be our main point of contact in Dave's absence.  Any question=

Subject: Credit Trading OnLine - Results of Legal Due Diligence and Risk Me=
mo

NOTE - GIVEN THE PROPOSED LAUNCH DATE OF 24 JANUARY 2000 FOR THIS PRODUCT,=
=20
THIS NOTE IS INTENDED TO SERVE BOTH AS A SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS OF OUR LEGA=
L=20
DUE DILIGENCE AND AS A RISK MEMO

As you know, we have carried out legal due diligence in the eight countries=
=20
where it was intended the credit product  would initially be traded via=20
EnronOnLine - namely, the UK, the US, Canada, Finland, Germany, Norway,=20
Sweden and Switzerland.  Under the terms of the credit product, on the=20
occurrence of  a bankruptcy with respect to a specified third party (the=20
Reference Entity) the Seller of the product (which could be either Enron or=
=20
its online counterparty) will pay a fixed, pre-agreed cash sum in an agreed=
=20
currency to the Buyer. (It should be borne in mind that this product differ=
s=20
in a number of ways from the more conventional credit derivatives traded in=
=20
the international markets. This means that a change in the nature or terms =
of=20
our product or the introduction of alternative credit products will likely=
=20
change the analysis below.)

Set out below is an overview of where we have come out on the more=20
significant legal issues.  I am also attaching a two page "Executive Summar=
y=20
of Legal Advice" prepared by outside counsel which highlights the significa=
nt=20
legal issues/risks in each country and which should be read in conjunction=
=20
with this note mail. As you will see, the Executive Summary does not focus =
on=20
issues we raised which are "all clear" from a legal perspective, so as to=
=20
keep the summary to a sensible length  (but there was plenty of good news=
=20
too!).  Where a legal issue has been identified, I have either set out belo=
w=20
what action is to be taken, or not addressed it further on the basis that, =
on=20
the advice of foreign counsel, the risk is not very substantial or unlikely=
=20
to materialise. Therefore, where no comment is made below in relation to a=
=20
risk highlighted in the attached summary, please assume that the legal risk=
=20
is one which, in our view, it is reasonable to take.

A.  Countries in which the credit product can be traded in January 2000

 Finland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, US

B.  Countries in which launch of the product via EnronOnline will need to b=
e=20
delayed

 Canada, Germany (reasons set out below)

C.  General Issues (applicable in all countries)

The credit product is fundamentally different from the usual energy and=20
related products we trade and so gives rise to new or increased legal risks=
=20
of a general nature:

(i)  Capacity - We will not be able to assume generally that our=20
counterparties will have the legal power and authority necessary to trade t=
he=20
product and so will need to check each counterparty's constitutional=20
documents before allowing them to trade the product online.  This applies t=
o=20
almost all entities (eg corporates, municipalities, insurance companies) in=
=20
all countries.  Some entities may lack the power to trade under the general=
=20
law (in which case we will not be able to deal with them at all) or under=
=20
their constitutional documents (in which case they will need to amend their=
=20
constitutional documents if they wish to trade). =20

The check need only be made once at the beginning of the credit trading=20
relationship and so can be added to our procedures.  It is not a particular=
ly=20
onerous job and will increase the cost of this business only incrementally.

(ii)  Confidentiality - We will need to put in place procedures to ensure=
=20
that we are not misusing confidential information about our business=20
counterparties on whom we are offering credit protection.  Misuse can occur=
=20
both in pricing the product and trading it.  The procedures will not includ=
e=20
formal Chinese Walls separating the credit traders from our other traders o=
r=20
the credit department (a point we have managed to agree with both UK and US=
=20
counsel following very detailed discussions).  The procedures will include=
=20
(a) the use of a Restricted List in both the US and Europe (similar to the=
=20
procedure currently used in Houston); and (b) practical steps to ensure tha=
t=20
confidential information derived from other areas of our business and which=
=20
we are not entitled to use (eg because it is the subject of a confidentiali=
ty=20
agreement) is not imparted to the credit traders.  In addition, where Enron=
=20
has an especially close relationship with a prospective reference entity, o=
r=20
otherwise has confidential information relating to such an entity, we will=
=20
need its written consent before offering protection on that entity.  Withou=
t=20
such consent, there will be an unjustifiably high risk of being sued by tha=
t=20
entity for breach of confidence.

D.  Country Specific Issues

(i)  Canada - There is a substantial risk that the product will constitute=
=20
insurance business, constituting an offence and rendering contracts in the=
=20
product unenforceable against our counterparties.  We should try to resolve=
=20
this issue with the Canadian authorities before launching the product in=20
Canada.  Timeframe for clearance is highly uncertain since it is not clear=
=20
which Canadian authority would take jurisdiction of the matter.

(ii)  Germany -  Again the issue is insurance.  The risk is higher than in=
=20
Canada and so Germany should be excluded initially.

(iii)  Norway - There is a material risk that the credit product could be=
=20
regarded as gaming in Norway, in which case trades would be void and=20
unenforceable.  The normal way to mitigate this risk in Norway is by using =
a=20
"substantial professional effort" to satisfy ourselves that a trade is bein=
g=20
entered into for valid commercial purposes (normally hedging) by our=20
counterparty. Clearly, it will not be possible to take such steps on a trad=
e=20
by trade basis in the context of EnronOnline.  At a minimum, we should=20
therefore ensure at the outset of the online trading relationship in this=
=20
product with each Norwegian counterparty that there is a commercial logic=
=20
behind its trading this product type.

(iv)  Switzerland -  If the credit product is the main purpose of our tradi=
ng=20
relationship with a counterparty, we should check with the Swiss supervisor=
y=20
authority whether the product constitutes insurance (the position being=20
unclear).  If a trade is insurance, it can be terminated by the counterpart=
y=20
(which is obviously of greater concern if Enron is the Buyer) and an offenc=
e=20
will be committed since Enron is not authorised as a Swiss insurer.  Howeve=
r,=20
I understand that the initial group of counterparties will be existing=20
business relationships, in which case we can parallel path this issue.

(v)  US (New York Law)=20

(a) CFTC regulation - by structuring the product either as a swap or an=20
option (and meeting certain other conditions) we can rely on exemptions und=
er=20
the US Commodities Exchange Act.=20

(b)  US securities laws - there is a small chance that the credit product=
=20
constitutes a "security" under US securities laws (please see attached=20
Executive Summary).  However, SEC regulations allow the public offering of=
=20
securities to "accredited investors" which will allow us to deal with=20
investors having at least US$5 million in assets.  Since most of our=20
counterparties will be fairly large, sophisticated players, this test shoul=
d=20
not impede the business.

(c)  Insider trading - US counsel have advised that the risk of insider=20
trading occurring as a result of the product being characterised as securit=
y=20
(see (b) above) is relatively remote.
