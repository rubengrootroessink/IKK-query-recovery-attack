I had a discussion with Mark Taylor, David Forster and Louise on Friday 
concerning returned PA's.  Here is the process:   If a PA comes back signed 
by the party we originally mailed it to, we can accept it and process it.  If 
a PA comes back from another party, we schould call the party we originally 
mailed to and ask what the signatory parties role is (ie who is he/she and 
what authority do they have).  Mark feels we should attempt to verify the 
signatory parties responsibilities however one attempt will be sufficient.  
Please keep good notes in the database (date, time of call, who you talked 
to, etc.)  If you have any questions on this call me.

If we receive a PA signed by someone at a company, then that individual is 
representing that they have the authority to do so (principle of ostensible 
authority)

We should obviously be careful that the mailing address matches what is in 
our database, but beyond that, no further checks should be required. Please 
proceed with sending the ID's.

Thanks,

Dave

Subject: Customer PA's

To date we have received a few PA's that have been signed by a person other 
than the party we mailed to.  We have called the companies and verified 
employment of the signatory parties.  (Called switchboard and requested party 
on the pretense that we had received their PA and would be processing right 
away).  Pending your approval we will start issuing Login id's.  We 
anticipate having the folders and envelopes on Mon or Tues.  We will wait 
until we hear from you to start processing the PA's we have to date.
