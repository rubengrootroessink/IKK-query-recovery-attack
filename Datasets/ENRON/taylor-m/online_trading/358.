Attached is the new site map file for auctions. It has been modified to 
reflect the ordering of the global nav and the removal of the ATA, which is 
no longer needed.

The View/Accept Contract screen will contain text cut which is currently in 
the About Storage Services section (I will modify the text file accordingly 
when received from Haakon).

Note that we are planning on using the same template as represented by the 
Market Info. screen in EnronOnline, although there will be a unique set of 
graphics for each of:

1) The Auctions Home Page
2) All of the EnBank pages (which will share the same graphic treatment, with 
appropriate title amendments).
