Subject to the optional "marketing information" questions, which I will

David

I have attached a redraft of the Registration Form.  You will see that we 
have amended the Credit Requirements section and have also made some 
suggested additions to the Legal Requirements section which Justin should 
review.

Please call with any comments or questions.

Regards

David
