David:
Here is the extent to what I think we can agree to:

1. At the end of Section 4(b) we can say "unless such access, entry, omission 
or action arises from acts or omissions of Enron and its directors, officers, 
employees, agents or contractors''.  What this does is not make them 
responsible for losses we incur as a result of our own actions.  To the 
extent that we suffer losses because of a third party claim brought against 
us and such claim is not as a result of actions on our part, their indemnity 
should cover this.

2. In Section 6(c), we could say, "Except as otherwise provided in Section 
4(b)"

Hope this helps.
