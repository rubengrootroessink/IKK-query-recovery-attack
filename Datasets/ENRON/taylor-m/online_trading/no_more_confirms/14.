Please see the attached revision to the EOL consent sent to you last week.  Please distribute to the appropriate parties.  You may direct ISDA related comments to me, power related comments to Janet Moore, and gas related comments to Stacy Dickson.  

We received your ISDA fax signatures.  What is the status of the ISDA opinion and other corporate materials?
