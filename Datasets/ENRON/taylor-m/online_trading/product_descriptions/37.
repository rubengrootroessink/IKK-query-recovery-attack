Please approve!  Dale has to make one revision to the product (the delivery 
location field is n/a to an ICAP product -- I had populated the field with 
some text from the product description, but Dave Forester doesn't like this 
approach.  So I have revised the product so that the delivery location field 
states that no delivery location is specified for the product.  

I'm not sure if the product will be rerouted for your approval, but if it is, 
I've signed off on the revised version.

Leslie

This looks good to me so I will go ahead and approve it unless you have an 
objection.

I have created the following new Product Type in the Data Manager:

US East Power Phy Firm ICAP

Please go into the DataManager and indicate your approval. If you have any 
questions concerning the Product Type, please DO NOT REJECT it, rather call 
me instead.

this Product Type for your review.
