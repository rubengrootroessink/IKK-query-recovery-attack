Mark,

The following is a new  power demand index requested by Claudio Ribeiro.  
Please let me know if it looks OK for the Website.

A US Power Demand Financial Swap Transaction with Enron North America Corp., 
under which the Seller is obliged to pay the Payment Amount to the Buyer 
where the Floating Amount is above the Fixed Amount, or where the Buyer is 
obliged to pay the Payment Amount to the Seller where the Floating Amount is 
below the Fixed Amount.  The Fixed Amount is the amount in Megawatts 
submitted in the "price" field by Counterparty via the Website. The Notional 
Amount is the product of the quantity submitted by Counterparty via the 
Website and the Pay Unit. The Payment Amount is the product of (i) the 
Notional Amount and (ii) the absolute value of the difference between the 
Floating Amount and the Fixed Amount.  The Payment Amount will be payable on 
or before ten (10) business days after the Floating Amount for the 
Determination Period is determinable.
The Determination Period is from and including the Effective Date of 04 Jun 
2001 (Initial Date) to and including the Termination Date of 08 Jun 2001 (End 
Date).
The Floating Amount shall be the arithmetic average of the hourly PJM loads 
for Peak hours on each Delivery Day during the Determination Period. The 
Floating Amount shall be calculated utilizing the hourly integrated loads 
published by PJM Interconnection, LLC ("PJM") on its official web site 
currently located at ftp://www.pjm.com/pub/account/loadhryr/index.html, or 
any successor thereto, under the heading "PJM Hourly Load Data".
The price is quoted in US Dollars per unit of volume, which will be the 
Contractual Currency.
The unit of measure against which the price is quoted shall be megawatts and 
the quantity shown shall be in total MWs.
The transaction is for on-peak ("Peak") hours on each Delivery Day beginning 
with the hour ending 0800 (7:00 am) and concluding with the hour ending 2300 
(11:00 pm) Eastern Prevailing Time.  "Delivery Day" means a day during the 
term of the transaction that is a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or 
Friday, excluding any day that is a NERC holiday.
The Pay Unit is 10 USD.

Thanks,

CW

Melba is out of the office for the remainder of the week and I will be taking 
on her responsibilities.  Let me know if the following language is OK for the 
new index:

The Floating Amount shall be the arithmetic average of the hourly loads for 
Peak hours on each Delivery Day during the Calculation Period. The Floating 
Amount shall be calculated utilizing the hourly integrated loads published by 
ISO New England Inc. ("ISO-NE") on its official web site currently located at 
http://www.iso-ne.com/Historical_Data/hourly_data/2001_hourly_data.txt, or 
any successor thereto, under the heading "Load".

Thank you,

Melba,

the web location for NEPOOL Data is (for 2001) 
http://www.iso-ne.com/Historical_Data/hourly_data/2001_hourly_data.txt. The 
demand data is the data on the column under the name LOAD. The formulation 
for the weekly index (demand) is the same as it is in PJM.

Thanks,

Claudio
