Please find attached the latest long description for the tanker freight products.  Please note that I will add this to the system this afternoon as it stands for the UK and Singapore products (changing the route details)  unless I hear otherwise so as to enable us to get everything approved and meet the live date for next Monday.

Thanks

Arfan

Scott,

I have read all the mails from Paul and his questions relate to the issue which Matthias brought up regarding if the Flat rate changes within a period would two flat rates be used etc etc.  The answer is no the last Flat Rate shall be used for the whole Determination Period.

I have attached the latest wording from legal for BITR 9 and made the appropriate changes highlighted in red, Singapore's amendment is shown in respect to our previous request in blue. 

Please let me know if you approve of the final wording so Arfan can send this to the lawyers for their final approval which hopefully after all this time would mean that  EOL can post BITR 9 & 11 and IITRA on EOL for Monday 16th July.  

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Regards,

Debbie
