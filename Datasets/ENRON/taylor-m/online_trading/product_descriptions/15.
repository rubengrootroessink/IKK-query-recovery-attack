Stacy,

Mark Taylor would like an email for your approval of both product types.  The descriptions are the same but the GTC's are different.  The 1 month or less product type uses the Spot GTC and the > 1 month product uses the firm GTC.  Please respond to Mark and copy me with your approval.  Sorry for the inconvenience.  Also, Susan Musch in Tax would like to revise the Phy GTC with new tax language.  Once I hear from her I will forward you the change.

Thanks,

CW
