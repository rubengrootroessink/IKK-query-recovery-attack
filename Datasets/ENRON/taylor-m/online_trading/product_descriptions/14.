Thank you for checking on that.  I am fine with the new product type.  I am still looking into the CIG product.

Stacy,

Geoff would like to use the GD Dawn index for delivery at Niagara.  If you would, please reply to this email and copy Mark Taylor so he will have documentation of your approval for the new product type.

Thanks,
