I am arriving early to attend a meeting with our copywriters at 11am - please 
feel free to attend 

Its with David MIckleberg (212 468 3038) at DMBB Advertising, 7th Floor, 1675 
Broadway (between 52nd and 53rd St) at 11am.

Following this we move to Sullivan & Cromwell at 14:00.  We (myself and Dave) 
are scheduled to return to Houston on the 19:45 CO1927 from La Guardia.  

Please give me a ring - I have a Skilling Business Review this morning which 
should be over mid afternoon - but I'll ring you at 8:15 your time (just in 
case your email is still not working).
