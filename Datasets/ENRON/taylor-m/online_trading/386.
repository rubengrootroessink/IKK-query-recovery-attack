Mark,

Attached is a copy of the OTC GTC which the Bandwidth group wishes to use for 
Bandwidth trading on EnronOnline, launching May 1.

Could you please let me know which of your guys will be looking after 
reviewing/amending this for EnronOnline?

Thanks,

Dave

David,

Here's a first cut of the data to get us started.  Please have a look, and 
let me know what other blanks we will need to fill in as we go.  I've also 
looked at the additional considerations, and we should sit down and discuss 
some of these things with Jean sometime soon.

Please review the attached documents, and I'll continue to refine them along 
the way.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks for your help,
Jay
