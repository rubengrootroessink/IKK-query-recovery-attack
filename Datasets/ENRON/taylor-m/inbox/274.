East)

Chris,

The current text in Section 7 of the Firm GTC for the CAN Gas Phy Index Fir=
m East products should be deleted and replaced with the following text:

(a)=09Seller shall be liable for and shall pay, or cause to be paid, or rei=
mburse Buyer, if Buyer has paid, all Taxes applicable to the Product sold h=
ereunder upstream of the Delivery Point(s).  If Buyer is required to remit =
such Tax, the amount thereof shall be deducted from any sums becoming due t=
o Seller hereunder.  Buyer shall be liable for and shall pay, cause to be p=
aid, or reimburse Seller, if Seller has paid, all Taxes applicable to the s=
ale and/or delivery of Product hereunder at and downstream of the Delivery =
Point(s) including any Taxes imposed or collected by a taxing authority wit=
h jurisdiction over Buyer; provided, however, when laws, ordinances or regu=
lations permit or impose upon Seller the obligation to collect or pay Taxes=
 applicable to the sale and/or delivery of Product hereunder at the Deliver=
y Point, Seller shall collect all such Taxes from Buyer, which shall be in =
addition to the Contract Price, and remit the same to the appropriate gover=
nmental authority. Seller or Buyer shall indemnify, defend, and hold the ot=
her Party harmless from and against any liability with respect to Taxes for=
 which the Seller or Buyer, as applicable, is liable hereunder.  Either Par=
ty, upon written request of the other, shall provide a certificate of exemp=
tion or other reasonably satisfactory evidence of exemption if either Party=
 is exempt from taxes, and shall use reasonable efforts to obtain and coope=
rate with obtaining any exemption from or reduction of any Tax.  Notwithsta=
nding the foregoing, (i) a Buyer purchasing the Commodity for delivery in a=
ny of the provinces of British Columbia, Ontario or Quebec must provide to =
the Seller a completed exemption certificate or drop-shipment certificate, =
as appropriate, i.e., a B.C. Certificate of Exemption, Ontario Purchase Exe=
mption Certificate or Quebec Drop-Shipment Certificate; and (ii) a Party is=
 not liable for any applicable Taxes that are legally imposed on the other =
Party and that are refundable to the other Party, including without limitat=
ion the Canadian Goods and Services Tax.  "Taxes" means any or all ad valor=
em, goods and services, property, occupation, gross receipts, privilege, sa=
les, use, consumption, excise, lease, transaction, and other taxes, governm=
ental charges, licenses, fees, permits and assessments, or increase therein=
, other than taxes based on net income or net worth. =20

(b)=09If a New Tax occurs that affects a Transaction, and Buyer would be re=
sponsible for such New Tax if it were a Tax under Section 7(a), and such Ne=
w Tax is of the type which Buyer can pass directly through to, or be reimbu=
rsed by, a Person other than Seller, Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid (o=
r reimburse Seller if Seller has paid) all such New Taxes and Buyer shall i=
ndemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller from any claims for such Taxes.  =
If a New Tax occurs that affects a Transaction, and Seller would otherwise =
be responsible for such New Tax if it were a Tax under Section 7(a), and su=
ch New Tax is of the type which Seller can pass directly through to, or be =
reimbursed by, a Person other than Buyer, Seller shall pay or cause to be p=
aid (or reimburse Buyer if Buyer has paid) all such New Taxes and Seller sh=
all indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer from any claims for such Taxe=
s.  If a New Tax occurs that affects a Transaction, and the provisions of t=
his Section 7(b) do not otherwise apply, the Party affected by the New Tax =
shall notify the Party not affected of such New Tax.  The Parties shall att=
empt to reach mutual agreement as to sharing of the New Tax.  If the Partie=
s are unable to reach mutual agreement within 5 business days, the Parties =
shall submit to binding arbitration, in accordance with the terms set forth=
 in Section 10 of this Agreement, to determine each Party's respective liab=
ility for the New Tax.  "New Taxes" means Taxes enacted and effective after=
 the Effective Date, including any change in the law, rule or regulation or=
 interpretation thereof relating to Taxes.  "New Taxes" shall not include a=
ny increase in the rate of Taxes, including increases in the rate of sales =
and use taxes, goods and services taxes, value added taxes, or taxes impose=
d generally on net income or profits.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments, or need additiona=
l information.

Best regards,
Susan
