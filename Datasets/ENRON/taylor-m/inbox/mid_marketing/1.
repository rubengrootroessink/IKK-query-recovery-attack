Thank you for your time today gentlemen. 

I am attaching a copy of today's presentation that you got a hard copy of today. 

Also, Tom mentioned that your group put together a presentation in the past that included a list of holding companies and their plants.  Can someone please forward the presentation(s) or the link(s) to me?  I am in the process of updating my models.  Scott had given me a copy of his companies and plants which was very helpful.  If each of you have such a list, I would benefit form it greatly.  I will let you guys respond to my request in the next week.  Then, if I need more information on certain companies or plants, I will try to contact the individual who covers those companies.

Thanks for all your help.
