Karen,

I wanted to check on two Enron accounts:

HG0714Q     Enron Methanol
HG0713S     EGP Fuels

These accounts are not on the website database yet with allocated
allowances for HGA.  I wanted to check the status of those two accounts.
Do you guys have all the paper work?  When will we appear on the website
database?

Sincerely,
Michael Taylor
