Mr. Taylor:
I attach the most current query from the September State Summary File.  It would be ideal if you could obtain data from the October State Summary File because then all of the data sent to you regarding your latest data request would be from October.  

BTW, the naming convention with this data is "enronxxxx.xls" where the x'x are the month (10 or 09) and the FY ('97, '98 '99 '00).  This file is also in Excel v. 5 format.  

Let me know if this data fits the bill.  Same billing information as with the previous data.

Jim,

Thanks for the great information.  Also, is any information available
for 2000 for any of the same account numbers?

Sincerely,

Mr. Taylor:
Here are the emissions data files from the appropriate State Summary
Files for the years 1997, 1998, 1999.  The attached files are in Excel
v. 5 format.  If Excel v. 5 format is not acceptable I will be able to
send them to you in ASCII.TXT, comma-delimited, first row of data used
as field names format.  Let me know if you want them in the latter
described format.  This data is just for the TNRCC account numbers
supplied in your request.  

Please let me know if this data is acceptable.  There is no charge for
this data because it is not the entire State Summary File for each year.


I want to thank you for typing the account numbers.  This saves me
considerable typing time when setting up the queries.  

If you have any questions or need additional data, you may contact me at
the locations listed below.  Thank you for the opportunity to serve your
data request.

Jim,

I wanted to know how I would find this data.  I am looking for the NOx
emissions for the accounts below for 1997-2000.  I have some of the data
for 1999, and very little for 2000.  How do I find the rest of the data?
Website?  Database?  I believe you sent me the state database in August
which included some 1999 and 2000 numbers for the accounts below.  I
suppose some more accounts may have been updated for 2000.

Mr. Taylor:
1)  The allowable data is generally unique to each permit.  Because of
this a general statement like "the allowable tons/year for SO2 in Harris
County is ......." would not be defendable or valid.  
2)  I believe that the allowable data varies in relation to the season
of year and part of the state - a.k.a., "ambient background threshold".
In other words, if it is ozone season, allowable emissions probably
would be lower.  
3)  The allowable emissions threshold is also variable over time.  25
years ago, Harris county probably did not need an allowable cap for
certain emissions.  As industry grows the allowable emissions will be
adjusted.  The period of time for the data to become outdated could be
as little as 1 month, depending on when new allowables or new permits
are initiated.  
4)  Texas charges corporations a "tax" for emissions over their
allowable limit.  It is sort of a pay-as-you-go plan.  Of course I am
being very simplistic here, but the point is still the same.  

Your questions are excellent and I am giving you as specific an answer
as possible.  I hope I am not being too pointed but to the data oriented
person, the previous points are important for data integrity.  Jim Parks

Jim,

Could you please explain to me where these numbers would NOT be
accurate?  I was warned that the data (allowables) would not be 100%
accurate because of certain reasons.  Can you please detail those
reasons for me?
