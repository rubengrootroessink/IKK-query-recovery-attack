ERC Certificate No. 1427 (Avista-Steag LLC) has been used as offsets, therefore it "does not" appear on the ERC Registry. 

ERC Certificate No. 1494 (Enron Corporation) remains active and available for use. It is located in the "transferred" section of the ERC Registry.

If you have any more questions, please call me at (512) 239-1589.

                                                                  Thank You
