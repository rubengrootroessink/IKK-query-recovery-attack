Mr. Taylor:
I attach the Excel v. 5 State Summary file.  This file is also in compressed, self-extracting format.  Please follow the directions given in the first email about how to inflate the data file.  You will have greater success with this data file than the previous one, without allowables.  

Again, please accept my apology for neglecting to send the correct data file.
