This is an example of a description from a contract in which we purchased DERC's from Dow Chemical:

The NOX DERC's reflect reductions of NOX emissions resulting from the 1995 shutdown of Boilers 1&2 at Seller's LHC-7 facility located in Freeport, Texas (the "LHC-7 Facility").

Could you provide something more descriptive, along those lines -- thanks, Bob

c) The owner or operator of a site receiving allowances on an annual basis may permanently sell those rights to any person. This request for transfer of ownership shall be completed by the executive director following the submission of a completed ECT-4 Form, Application for Permanent Transfer of Allowance Ownership. The executive director will issue a letter to the purchaser and seller reflecting this transaction. The transaction will be considered finalized upon issuance of this letter. 

The above is from Title 30, Part 1, CH 101, Subchapter H, Division 3, Rule 101.356 (Texas Administrative Code)
