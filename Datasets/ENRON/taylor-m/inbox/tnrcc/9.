Mr. Taylor:
I attach 3 files.  The WordPerfect definition/layout sheet may be used for all the State Summary Files sent with this and subsequent files sent in this series.  The WordPerfect v. 8 "Extract2.WPD" document may also be used with this, and the subsequent emails sent.  
1) "EXTRACT2.WPD" is a WordPerfect v. 8 document that describes the process of inflating a self-extracting, compressed file.  The short version is to same the file to your hard disk.  Using Microsoft Windows Explorer, go to that saved file and double click on the file to begin the self-inflating process.  
2) "STATESM.WPD" is a WordPerfect v. 8 document that may be used as a field layout/definition sheet for attachment #3.
3) "STATSM97.EXE" is a data file in Excel v. 5, compressed, self-extracting format.

I will send 3 more emails to you because the State Summary Files are rather large and I don't want to drag down our file server.  As I mentioned before, you may use the #1 & #2 attachments for the remaining 3 emails.  

I will send you the invoice as well as the data disks and supporting documents through the US Postal Service.  

If you have any questions or need additional data, you may contact me at the locations listed below.  Thank you for the opportunity to serve your data request.
