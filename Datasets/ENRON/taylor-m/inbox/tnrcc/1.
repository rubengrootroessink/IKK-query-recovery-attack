Mr. Taylor:
I can get that information for you.  I am having some temporary trouble with the PSDB database that should be resolved by Thursday of this week.  I will look for how historical the data is for the State Summary File.  I have been keeping some of the files since 1997.  I will be able to give you this answer tomorrow morning because I am scheduled to leave for the day about 30 minutes ago.  Jim Parks

Jim,

I wanted to know how I would find this data.  I am looking for the NOx
emissions for the accounts below for 1997-2000.  I have some of the data
for 1999, and very little for 2000.  How do I find the rest of the data?
Website?  Database?  I believe you sent me the state database in August
which included some 1999 and 2000 numbers for the accounts below.  I
suppose some more accounts may have been updated for 2000.

Mr. Taylor:
1)  The allowable data is generally unique to each permit.  Because of
this a general statement like "the allowable tons/year for SO2 in Harris
County is ......." would not be defendable or valid.  
2)  I believe that the allowable data varies in relation to the season
of year and part of the state - a.k.a., "ambient background threshold".
In other words, if it is ozone season, allowable emissions probably
would be lower.  
3)  The allowable emissions threshold is also variable over time.  25
years ago, Harris county probably did not need an allowable cap for
certain emissions.  As industry grows the allowable emissions will be
adjusted.  The period of time for the data to become outdated could be
as little as 1 month, depending on when new allowables or new permits
are initiated.  
4)  Texas charges corporations a "tax" for emissions over their
allowable limit.  It is sort of a pay-as-you-go plan.  Of course I am
being very simplistic here, but the point is still the same.  

Your questions are excellent and I am giving you as specific an answer
as possible.  I hope I am not being too pointed but to the data oriented
person, the previous points are important for data integrity.  Jim Parks

Jim,

Could you please explain to me where these numbers would NOT be
accurate?  I was warned that the data (allowables) would not be 100%
accurate because of certain reasons.  Can you please detail those
reasons for me?
