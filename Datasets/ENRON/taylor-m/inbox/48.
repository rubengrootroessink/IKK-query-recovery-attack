World  Trade Center and Pentagon Images:
The smoke has cleared much faster than  the memories will. Various space sensors captured the plume. I provide you with  links to some of these:http://www.nasa.gov/newsinfo/WTCplume.html http://www.visibleearth.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/viewrecord?9906 
The  best of the sites is the globalsecurity.org.http://www.globalsecurity.org/eye/wtc.htm 
Many of these  are 1.5m (yes, meters) resolution images of the WTC and Pentagon sites. These  are truly striking images. They lead you to wonder what the really good  satellites can see!
The New York Times web site has a collection of  excellent (non-satellite) images. They also have a special edition of their  magazine devoted to the tragedy.http://www.nytimes.com/
