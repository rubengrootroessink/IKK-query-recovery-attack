ZBT to host Benefit Concert

We, the Brothers of Zeta Beta Tau, members of the Monmouth College community
wish to, in an entertaining manner, give back to the community that has thus
far supported us so well.  In order to accomplish this, the Brothers of ZBT

the entire community while raising money for an important local
organization, Jamieson Center.

that caters to the needs of the residents of Warren and Henderson Counties
of Illinois.  Present services offered by the Jamieson Community Center
include a Thrift Shop, emergency food pantry, emergency services, Christmas
Store and Christmas Baskets, childhood immunizations, SHARE Food Program,
meals for seniors, summer feeding services for children, Women Infants and
Children, domestic violence counseling, and much more.  Jamieson Center
provides thousands of instances of assistance each year to persons of all
ages with a variety of needs.

On November 10th Zeta Beta Tau will be holding the philanthropic event for
the Jamieson Community Center.  The ZBT Benefit Concert will be a
combination of musical performances by members of the Zeta Beta Tau
Fraternity, students and faculty members of Monmouth College.  To reserve
tickets, please call Andrew Rubia at (309) 457-3069.  Donations for Jamieson
Center will be accepted c/o Zeta Beta Tau at 318 N. 9th St., #491, Monmouth,
