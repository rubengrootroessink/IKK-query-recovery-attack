Michael,

This looks fine. However, in the future it would probably be a good idea to have a quick legal review.

The Emissions group has made one-page brochure, and we have printed 2000 copies.  Juli Salvagio mentioned that I should show a copy to legal before we send it out.  I was unaware that legal should take a look at the document.
