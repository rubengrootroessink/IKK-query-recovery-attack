Thanks, Mike.  Jeff and Carter-please work through me when designing this piece.  I would like it to be consistent with some of the other things we are developing.  Attached is a Global Markets Folder and one Fact Sheet (Done for Fertilizers) that we are printing for the PR group to use with Media and Customers.  It is just a general brochure which will include Fact Sheets for the following:

Weather
Emissions
Coal
Plastics, Petchems, NGLs
Crude Products
Fertilizers

I think your design should be consistent with the look so it can be used for multi-purposes.  Let me know your thoughts.

Jeff and Carter,

I am sending you the text that our group wanted to make a one-pager out of.  I spoke with both of you guys last week.  I was hoping you guys would develop a few different looks and show us.  Some pictures and borders would be fine.  I am not sure if the text we have would work better on one-page front or one-page front and back.  
	
Carter our cost center is 120420 and our company number  is 1105.  Please contact me if more information is needed.
