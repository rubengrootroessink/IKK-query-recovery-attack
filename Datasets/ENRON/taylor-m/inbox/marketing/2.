Hi,

Attached are the fact sheets and FAQs we prepared for use in our media pitches.  The fact sheets are designed to provide them with information and the FAQs to get them asking questions that would lead to a request for an interview and/or coverage for Enron in their publications.  Please let me know if the documents meet with your approval.  

Thank you.
Habiba
