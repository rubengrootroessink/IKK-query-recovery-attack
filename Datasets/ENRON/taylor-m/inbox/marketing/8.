Felipe--

Will you please register these 4 names:
enronemissionsservices.com
enronemissionservices.com
emissionsservices.com
emissionservices.com
(The slight difference between each pair is that one has the "s" on "emissions" and one does not.)

I don't have an IP address for you yet, but I will send it along in the next day or so.

On the "enronemissions.com" issue I'm going to do some double-checking before I get Legal involved.

Thanks.
