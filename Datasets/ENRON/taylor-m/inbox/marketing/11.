Looks like enronemissions.com is registered to some guy at Arthur Andersen in the UK.  But... before I tell the people in Legal that someone grabbed this domain name illegally, would you please check with your VP and see if he has *any* contact names of people in Enron Europe doing Emissions?  I'd like to do a little double-checking first.
