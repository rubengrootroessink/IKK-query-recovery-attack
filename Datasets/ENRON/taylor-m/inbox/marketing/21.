Nothing.  It is a generic folder that has Enron Global Markets on the cover.  It is the one that I sent you to match your insert to when you were designing.  With the dots.  I am on my way over for a meeting, I'll bring one.

I would like to see a folder.  What was used from the emissions group, exactly?

Sorry so late in getting back to you.  The folders are in.  Do you need some?
