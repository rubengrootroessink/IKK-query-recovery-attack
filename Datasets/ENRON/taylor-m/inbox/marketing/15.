1.  I have an email out to Mark Holsworth in Legal asking if there will be fees charged back to your group for pursuing "enronemissions.com".  My guess is no, but I'll pass Mark's answer on to you.

2.  We did secure the four domain names we discussed (listed below).  Shall I go forward with hooking them up to the site at http://www.enron.com/wholesale/emissions/?

3.  Are these new domain names part of a larger plan in your group to promote your site and/or send potential customers to it?   You may want to get with Juli Salvagio in Wholesale Marketing -- she's a great resource for cooking up coordinated marketing approaches.  We work with her on all the Wholesale sites.

4.  You mentioned that you found some old content through the search engine.  We are in the process of tracking that down.   If you remember what you typed into the search box that would be helpful.

Brandon
