I'd like to hire a writer to interview you.  I'd like to develop a small brochure, but need to have approval on budget.  We're looking at approximately $10,000-$15,000 for a short brochure.  The higher end brochures 12-16 pages run from $20,000-$35,000 depending how sophisticated the design and printing is.  I'd also like to explore more opportunities for advertising.  I spoke to the rep from Risk Magazine and she indicated that there was a huge show that would be the perfect venue to distribute the magazine or a supplement. She said Lisa Jacobson would know about this.  Do you know her?  Let's discuss.  Please reply.  I'd like to get started asap.
