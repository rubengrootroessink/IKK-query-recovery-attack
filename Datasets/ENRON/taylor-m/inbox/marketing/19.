Mike,

This document was set up in Illustrator for printing purposes and we won't be able convert it to a word document without recreating it. If you want something created as a word doc, we can try to set that up for you but we will not be able to recreate some of the graphical elements from the original piece because of limitations with Word's format.

Do you want me to have someone recreate the document in word?

Thanks,
Carter

Mike,

I got your voicemail yesterday with approval. I wanted to send you this final PDF to show you want we released. If you haven't sent it over already, could you fax the signed approved with changes form over to keep with the files.

The revised printing costs will be here shortly (there was a mistake so I sent it back). It will definitely be less though.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Carter
