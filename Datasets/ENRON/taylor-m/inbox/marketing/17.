Looks like I was right -- legal fees are absorbed by Legal.  The "transfer fee" they speak of is nominal -- $35 or $50 or something like that.

     Mark,

     Subject to Chuck's thoughts, I believe you are right.

	I don't think there is any charge other than the transfer fees.  Is that right?  Aren't your fees sent to Derrick?

The Emissions group asked me if there would be any chargeback to their RC associated with tracking down and securing "enronemissions.com," that domain name that we talked about last week.

Thanks.
