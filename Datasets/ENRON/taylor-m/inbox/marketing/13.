Thanks Mike.

I will have the designer put the final copy into design six. We do not have a sample of the 100# paper that was quoted for the job. However, I could show you a color laser for you to sign off on if you just wanted to see a printed copy.

Just let me know.

Thanks,
Carter

Carter,

We like design six.  Please put in the text from yesterday.  The color scheme is good.  Please make sure Enron Emissions Services is bigger than the second title (only by one font size).  Also, can we see it on the 100# paper this afternoon.  Around 3-3:30 this afternoon would be great.

Mike

Michael,

Based on what we talked about this morning, we will address the size issue of the heading, "Enron Emissions" compared to the the sub head. 

Tell me what you think about this new direction and maybe we can go from there. Also, we will wait for the copy to be finalized before proceeding. 

We are thinking about putting more of the content on the back. Right now they are one sided but are reading kind of copy heavy.

Call me to discuss. 

Thanks,
Carter Miles
