Mark;

I saw your note replying to my earlier e-mail today re. ISDA (thanks).  Alt=
hough it is Enron Brazil's goal to be able to enter into these type of ener=
gy commodities derivatives transactions in the future, it seems to me that =
there are several tax implications (still to be resolved and/or optimized) =
which prevent us from participating in this market.

Considering your and Brent's energy commodity derivatives experience in the=
 US, do you think you could assist me to put together this "Wish List" for =
ISDA to discuss with the Brazilian authorities ?

Tks,

Sami

RE:=09=09=09Next Brazilian Subcommittee Meeting


Dear All,

ISDA would like to schedule a Brazilian Subcommittee Meeting next week. The
proposed dates are the following: October, 3rd, 4th or 5th at 11:00 am New
York time at ISDA. Please choose the date that is more convenient so that w=
e
can make appropriate arrangements. As usual, we will provide a call in
number for people that are traveling or located abroad.

ISDA is considering a visit to Brazil of several days in order to hold
meetings with the Central Bank as well as other regulators - NMC, e.g.,
market players, netting legislation contacts, lawyers working on master
agreement development, and others in order to further the agenda of the
Brazilian Subcommittee and to be able to prepare for the conference planned
for Brazil next year.

In preparation for our subcommittee meeting ISDA would like to obtain from
your institution a list ("Wish List") of local OTC derivatives market issue=
s
for ISDA to address as well as suggestions for meetings and organizations
with which ISDA might meet to address these issues. This "Wish List" will b=
e
of enormous help to ISDA for purposes of having an adequate and focused
agenda for planning visits with a number of Brazilian institutions and
authorities.

Please reply R.S.V.P. by email to Scott Marra (smarra@isda.org) if you woul=
d
like to attend.

If you have additional suggestions in terms of the topics to be included in
our agenda please do not hesitate to contact me.
