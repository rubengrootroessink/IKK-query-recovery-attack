Thanks Michael,

I checked out the web page as well and it looks real good.  I'd like to
invite you and Trevor to join my next monthly national conference call with
my key power project managers to discuss your services and have some two-way
Q&A.  Could you be available on 10/25 at around 11:45 am your time?  If so,
I can call in to you at that time. Hope you can make it.  If not we can
always arrange another time.
