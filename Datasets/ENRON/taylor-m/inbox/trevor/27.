	Gentlemen:

By a series of communications, the parties have stated their views
concerning the purchase and sale of 250 Texas NOx Certified Discreet
Emission Reduction Credits ("Certified DERCs").  PG&E Energy Trading -
Power, L.P. has carefully reviewed the file and our final position is set
forth below.

PGET was interested in purchasing Certified DERCs for immediate delivery.
These terms were critical to us, we conveyed them to the broker and we
consistently stated them to Enron.  Enron has failed to tender a contract
reflecting these terms and has repudiated any obligation to deliver Certifed
DERCs on this basis.  PGET has no obligation to purchase (and will not
purchase) the "registered" emissions reductions credits which Enron claims
it sold to PGET, nor will PGET stand by while Enron seeks to obtain
Certified DERCs.  We consider this matter closed, whether as a result of
your breach of contract or because the parties failed to reach agreement ab
initio.

	Regards,

	Peter Meier, Associate General Counsel
	301-280-6817
