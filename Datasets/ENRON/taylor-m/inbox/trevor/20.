Version 2.0 of E-GRID2000 is now complete and available by download from
our website:
     www.epa.gov/airmarkets/egrid/
Version 2.0 of E-GRID2000 will also be available on a free CD-ROM.
Existing orders for the CD-ROM will be filled beginning in early October.
If you would like to place a new request for the CD-ROM, please send your
mailing address to:
     comments.egrid@epa.gov

Version 2.0 of E-GRID2000 includes several new features, such as:
     * interchange data between grid regions for 1994 through 1998
     * estimated imports/exports by state for 1994 through 1999
     * total US imports/exports for 1994 through 1999
     * improved Data Browser and Spreadsheets
E-GRID2000 Version 2.0 includes 1998 data for emissions and resource mix,
reflecting minor revisions from Version 1.0, released March 2001.  For a
more detailed description of E-GRID, see the following:
     www.epa.gov/airmarkets/egrid/factsheet.html

Forthcoming E-GRID2001, with 1999 data, should be completed by this winter.
