In the last week Air Liquide has asked for more information about the methods used to calculate the allowances for the plant, but have not rescheduled the conference call with their emissions broker and Enron that was originally scheduled for September 11th. I have not heard anything from TNRCC about the allowances, but I will inform you as soon as I hear anything.

Marc,
How's things looking at the plant?  Also, do you know if they've been allocated an amount of allowances for the plant for the new HGA NOx cap and trade program?
Thanks,
Trevor
