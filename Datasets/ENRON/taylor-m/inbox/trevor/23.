Trevor Woods

It was nice to see you at the NOx Budget Workshop last week in Alexandria,
Virginia.  I hope you were able to attend our reception Wednesday evening
following the last Q&A session.

As promised, I am forwarding to you more information about Environmental
Systems Corporation (ESC).  Attached to this e-mail is our Statement of
Qualifications for your review.  Due to the deadlines set by the EPA for
emissions monitoring plans and subsequently, deadlines for systems to be in
place, affected sources are actively seeking DAS and reporting systems to
be in compliance with the EPA's emission guidelines.  ESC is very capable
of assisting you and your company with your CEM system needs, from top of
the stack sampling to data acquisition management and quarterly electronic
reporting. ESC is an A -to- Z company when it comes to emissions monitoring
and reporting. Our management takes great pride in providing timely
installations and excellent customer service at a fair price.  ESC also
offers detailed in-house or on-site training for all your software/hardware
requirements. Please consider ESC for your emissions monitoring system.

If you would like more detailed information about ESC or if you have any
questions about EPA guidelines for emissions monitoring, please feel free
to call on us without obligation.
