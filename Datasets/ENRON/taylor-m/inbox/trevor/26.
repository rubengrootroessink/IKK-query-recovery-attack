            ok, it's a 98.2 tpy balance.  and as far as I can tell, it's in
            certificate
            number 1427.  What was the last deal you did for those--81 tpy
   to
      Air
            Liquide on 11/14/00?  Reducing the ~179 to 98.

            keep me posted.

            according to our records and the tnrcc we don't have any.  if
   you
         know
            better and can find the cert numbers we'll sell them.

   around

               sounds
                     like he
                     would hit the next bid a fair bit below.
