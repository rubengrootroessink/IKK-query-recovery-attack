FYI. I copied the information below from TNRCC's web site regarding the forms (ECT-3) that have been submitted to TNRCC to calculate emission allowances. It appears we will not be receiving responses any time soon.
Emissions Banking and Trading Program
*Level of Activity Certification Update* 
The Emissions Banking and Trading team is currently in the process of reviewing about 300 Form ECT-3, Level of Activity Certifications that have been submitted thus far. Due to the overwhelming workload, the review process will last for the remainder of the year. If you have submitted a Form ECT-3, a team member will contact you, should the need arise for additional supporting information. Thank you for your cooperation.

Marc,
How's things looking at the plant?  Also, do you know if they've been allocated an amount of allowances for the plant for the new HGA NOx cap and trade program?
Thanks,
Trevor
