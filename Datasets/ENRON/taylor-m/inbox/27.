Thank you for your e-mail and phone call!  We received both and were
really sorry not to be here when you called.  I guess we were both at
work.  When we were watching this tragedy on TV Tuesday, we couldn't
remember exactly when you were coming home, so called your office.  Holly
called us back to say that you were due back Wednesday.  That was a
relief because we knew you weren't in the air on Tuesday.  It just dawned
on me this morning that your e-mail was from you usual address so you
could probably receive mail in London at that address as well as send.

Tim called about 10:45 Tuesday morning to say that they weren't allowing
anyone to leave his base so he was stuck there for awhile but Sharon was
OK and going home.  Either his information was erroneous or the base was
opened not long thereafter because he was also allowed to leave and both
were home by early afternoon.  I was concerned about how long it would
take Sharon to drive home because 20 years ago when I was driving home
during a storm and all the government offices were closing, it was a zoo.
 It turned out that Sharon drove right along the river and up Rock Creek
Park with hardly any traffic since the streets between hers along the
river and the rest of the city were already closed so no streets were
emptying into hers.

Tim Bunce was in the air on his way to California.  They brought his
flight down in Dallas and he was planning to drive home from Dallas.
Someone at my office told me yesterday that her brother was stuck in
Houston and was driving back to Cincinnati!

Nick's sixth grade class in Wyoming was told about the situation. I don't
know if they let them watch the TV.  Janet was oblivious--out doing
errands--so there was noone at home.  However, Ivan stopped by the house
for some reason just when Nick called home.  Nick was concerned about you
and Tim because he couldn't remember where you live.  That really touched
me, that he would think of you and that the school let him call home.  I
called them when Tim called to let us know they were all home safely and
that you were in London.

At the time this was happening we had no idea where would be struck next.
 You have probably heard that the FBI now says that the flight that went
into the Pentagon was originally going to hit the White House and that
the flight that went down over PA undoubtedly was bound for a more
populated target.    We were watching when the towers collapsed and found
it surreal--unbelievable.  We watched for some time after that but
finally we couldn't stand it.  We just had to turn off the TV and do
something else.  That seemed almost dishonorable though--to look outside
on a beautiful sunny, peaceful day here.  We were having a primary
election for mayor in the city so we went to vote because that was
something positive we could accomplish.  During the rest of the day we
checked the status of the situation regularly, but didn't watch for a
prolonged time.  It was impossible to concentrate on much of anything.

Now I feel that we need to return to normal activities as much as
possible to keep our little part of the country running as usual.  The
terrorists will have done even more damage if we don't.

I imagine Enron has people marooned all over the world.  At least you
have an Enron office where you are.  I should think that would be better
than being stuck somewhere in Canada, wondering if you should drive home.
 I hope they are providing you some space where you can accomplish
something.  I imagine you are keeping the phone lines busy to Houston
these days.  I just read in the Wall Street Journal this morning that the
Y2K plans are paying off for some companies who had alternate plans for
communication difficulties and even "bunkers" or alternate offices in
place that they are now using.

This will surely be a test of our president and his government.  I hope
they are up to it.

Please let us know when you finally get home.

Love, Mother
