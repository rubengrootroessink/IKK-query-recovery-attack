Nope, but I would call up some of the SCR manufacturers, Babcock and Wilcox=
, ABB, GE.  Also, did you see the article in that same issue of Clean Air C=
ompliance about AEP Ammonia on Demand.  It's gonna be all about urea baby. =
 I would figure out a strategy fast, after it's in a news article its prett=
y much too late.  As clueless as the NOXTech guys are it may be worth picki=
ng their brains to try to get some insight. Call me if you want to bounce s=
ome ideas around.=20

P.S. Wouldn't you want to buy ammonia if you think there is going to be mor=
e demand for it?

Got it.  Looks like the ammonia market is long and has a ton of diverse pla=
yers.  Did you do analysis on what the demand of the SCRs would be?  I'm wo=
ndering if we couldn't sell it as a hedge as opposed to a spec play.  The m=
ore SCRs the more ammonia goes up and the cost of allowances go down (in th=
eory).

The link didn't work.  Is this in today's journal?  I'll forward you an ema=
il from Jeff Keeler.  Nobody here seems very concerned with her comments.  =
From our regulatory, to a few traders.
