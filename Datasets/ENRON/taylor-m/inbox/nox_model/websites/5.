Cool, thanks Mike.  Sit down with them and check and see if it could even be a play.  i've got no idea really.  i think the cranes may be our only other play.  i'm back wed, but buzz me on my cell with any questions.  
I hope everything went as well as could be expected back home.  let me know if you need to roll at any time.  
thanks,
trev

Trevor, 

I spoke with Vince for a minute because he was on his way out.  He told me Cormetech (maybe 50% of market) and Seimens are the two largest SCR catalyst manufactures.  The group was very interested why I wanted to know about SCR catalysts.  The group seemed to chuckle when I mentioned trying produce a  deal to have an edge in the SCR catalyst market.  They said something about a cormetech plant that may be empty.  I think I should try to seat down with him and pick his brain.

Also, ammonia and urea look like pretty big markets but I have only found a few sources.  

Labor looks like it would be too tough because of the many unions involved.  

I still have not got in touch with the crane people or any housing structures for the SCR. 


Any other thoughts?  I have looked at the links you gave me. 
  
Mike
