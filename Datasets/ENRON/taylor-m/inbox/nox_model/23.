Rajneesh

Here is a copy of the "BoilCap and NOx" file, which I am submitting for review.  It is as up to data as I can get it.  

Changes Suggested
  - If the Holding Company's background is red, I suggest deleting the duplicated line.
  - If the Holding Company's background is black, read the comment and do or dont do what I suggest.
  - If the Holding Company's background is orange, then it is listed twice for the same unit, but in different percentages, and sometimes Operating companies. Can decide to combine this into one line or leave it as it is.
  - If the Holding Company's background is pink, then I attempted to contact the plant/company directly for information and the email address or phone number is listed in the comment.  No one has responded (of course).

Changes Made
  - Holding Company, Operator, Plant Name, Current Tech, Future Tech, Boiler Type, Ownership, Nameplate, NOx Rate, Fuels, EGU, Major Ownership, and Sec. 126 Inclusion have been updated by what I found in PowerDat and other sources.  
  - Sec. 126 EGU and Non-EGU credit allocations were entered as per 1999 EPA data given in hardcopy form.  Some of this was "adjusted", regard comments for individual spreadsheet entries.

New Sources
  -  If I found a facility that did not have all its ownership represented, I added the missing party below the big maroon line as a new entry.  Only information I was confident entering was added.
  - If I fould a new facility, either in operation, standby, or planned (due online by 2004), I added its data below the maroon line.

I can stop by to discuss this if you have any questions.  Thanks.
