Jason,

Here's a list of things that are pending:
Convert Lbs to Tons in all the tables and charts
Create a demand and supply table for each season (with the names of the holding companies with their respective numbers in a backup sheet)
Put the current season in the Input sheet (for calculating the number of seasons available for compliance)
Extend the current feature regarding announced technologies to take into account the season for an announced SCR (so that it will be effected by the SCR Cap per season)
Fix the LNB SCR trade-off
Include a feature that spaces out the SCRs depending upon the limit of SCRs per holding company per season
Pricing: Will discuss this either today evening or tomorrow morning
SCR Allocation Schedule: Will revert to you on how to handle 2003 and 2004 (whether to move backward/ forward/ something better)
