 I am writing to make a correction to yesterday's table.  Joel and I 
were looking over Connecticut's SIP rule because he noticed that 
1990 seemed too early.  Connecticut defines baseline EGUs as 
those that were operating prior to 1990 and those units are 
allocated from the main trading budget.  The change I would like to 
note is that the state also distinguishes between "new units" and 
"new EGUs."  New EGUs are anything operating prior to the 2001 
season and they are allocated separately, but also from the main 
trading budget.  The point is that anything prior to 2001 will receive 
allowances from the main pool, they will just be allocated 
differently.  This won't affect our current tasks as Connecticut does 
not allocate until three months prior to the start of the season.  I 
am attaching a corrected table.  

Thanks, 
Sara
