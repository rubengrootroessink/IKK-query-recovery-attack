This kind of fucks things up a bit.

Subject:=09Court Decision on NOx - EPA Section 126 Rule
Importance:=09High

The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, DC Circuit, issued a ruling today on the=
 EPA Section 126 Rule.  (As brief background, the 126 Rule would have requi=
red compliance with more stringent summer-season NOx caps starting in May 2=
003 in several northeast and Midwest states)

The Order states: =20

"It is Ordered that EPA's Section 126 Rule is remanded as to all cogenerato=
rs, but vacated only as to those cogenerators classified as electric genera=
ting units ("EGUs") under the rule that supply equal to or less than one th=
ird of their potential capacity or equal to or less than 25 MW to the grid =
for sale per year."   Translation:  This part of the order appears to "vaca=
te" or completely throw out the 126 rule for small cogen units (under 25 MW=
) or cogen units selling less than 1/3 into the grid.   For all other cogen=
erators, the court remands the rule to EPA for re-working, consistent with =
some of the court's earlier objections about EPA's handling of cogens.   Im=
pact:  EPA will need to go back and formulate rules for cogens altogether, =
so there is currently no NOx compliance schedule in place for cogen units. =
  EPA will need to start from scratch for smaller cogens.

"It is Further ordered that as of May 15, 2001, the date of this court's de=
cision, the three-year compliance period for emissions limitations applicab=
le to EGUs under the Section 126 Rule is tolled, pending EPA's resolution o=
f the remand of EGU growth factors ordered by this court."  Translation:  T=
his more significant part of the order "tolls" -- or puts on hold -- compli=
ance with the 126 Rule for ALL ELECTRIC GENERATING UNITS (EGUs) until EPA r=
esolves EGU growth factor issues that the court identified in its May 15, 2=
001 ruling.    =20

Impact:  The practical effect of this part of the order will be to delay im=
plementation of the Section 126 Rule until May 2004, when the EPA's NOx SIP=
 Call regulation is scheduled to go into effect.   The EPA will not be able=
 to re-issue its Section 126 rules in a time frame that would require compl=
iance before May 2004.  The NOx SIP Call would have supplanted the Section =
126 Rule in May 2004 anyway -- what this ruling does is take away some of t=
he uncertainty that existed for the May to September 2003 period (original =
effective date of the Section 126).   This means that generators in states =
not covered already by existing NOx trading programs (OTR NOx program) will=
 have another year to comply.

I will forward any more detailed legal analysis as I receive it, but this i=
s the latest news.

Please call if you have any questions.
