Ohio is trying to provide a cushion for their participating units.  The 
May 2004 allocations are basically extra allowances that 
companies may use to comply with the NOx program.  The month 
of May is not included in the trading season, so by giving 
allowances during that month, Ohio would effectively be giving an 
extra month's worth of allowances for free.  The allowances in May 
are in addition to EPA's approved NOx budget for the state.  EPA 
has expressed "extreme dissatisfaction" with the approach and 
Ohio officials expect that it will have to be removed from the plan.
