Mark,
I can use your advise on a few new projects that I am working on.

1.  The weather desk is trying to roll out a HDD Swap for Calgary by Monday=
.  Most of the anticipated buyers of the product will be Canadian counterpa=
rties ECC has masters with.  The desk originally thought that we need to cr=
eate a GTC for Enron Canada using the ENA weather GTC.  Because if the time=
 issues involved in creating a new GTC (fixing all the things that are wron=
g with the ENA form) I looked for a new way to deal with this issue.  I thi=
nk I found it in section 3(d) of the ETA which provides that the Enron coun=
terparty to a particular transaction will be the Enron Entity they have a m=
aster with that covers that type of transaction.  I believe this provision =
was a stroke of genius designed for just this type of scenario.  I can prep=
are the long description to specify the Enron entity as "the applicable Enr=
on entity" and if there is a master then the Enron Entity is the one with t=
he master pursuant to Section 3(d) of the ETA and if there is no master the=
 ETA says the GTC applies and the GTC specifies that ENA is the counterpart=
y.  Do you think this works?

2.  I was contacted by someone at McKinsey & Company yesterday who is worki=
ng with the weather desk to develop a Bermuda Transformer Commercial Struct=
ure to partner up with the Insurance market to provide some capital to our =
weather trading desk.  I have been told that conceptually it will be a Jedi=
 type arrangement.  I have been asked to help them think through the issues=
 and coordinate with the other attorneys who work on these types of issues.=
  I do not want to get too deep into the structuring of this investment veh=
icle myself without the appropriate legal group involved.  Would this be so=
mething Jordan Mintz's group would handle or would this be something that L=
ance Schuler's group would develop?  I thought I might want to talk to Juli=
a Murrey (or Cristina Mordant or Carol St. Clair) to see what issues croppe=
d up in the development of Jedi I and Jedi II (or maybe I should just talk =
to whatever lawyer is currently handling these structures).  What are your =
thoughts on how to move forward?

3.  The other rush deal is a financing deal out of Jordan's group.  The dea=
l I helped look at that was a physical forward using ISDA type language is =
now a financial deal (a series of Total Return Swaps) that needs to close n=
ext Friday.  I will go to a meeting in the morning to try and get more info=
rmation on the structure.  Angela Davis who has worked on the Total Return =
swap deals has offered to help me pilot this through.  Sara thought I shoul=
d check with you to make sure you don't have a problem with me taking on on=
e of these deals.  I am going to try and make sure they have Danny Sullivan=
 from A&K working on the deal since he is the most knowledgeable lawyer on =
this type of structure. =20

I hope all goes well with your return flight plans.

Brent
