Mary, we are under a good deal of commercial pressure to execute the power =
swap with Ontario Power Generation by the end of 3rd quarter.  I understand=
 the swap is for 3 years after Ontario Market Opening, with Enron as fixed =
price payor (Cdn. $50) and OPG as floating price payor.  I also understand =
that OPG has provided their comments on the documentation, and would apprec=
iate if we made it a top priority to review and respond to their comments a=
s soon as possible.  I understand that there may be a significant number of=
 matters ongoing for quarter end, as well as because of the recent events. =
 However, the draft ISDA has been outstanding for a considerable period and=
, as mentioned, we have commercial pressure to execute the transaction.  If=
 it would expedite matters, perhaps we could document under an Omnibus GTC =
(although OPG will likely have similar comments which will need to be addre=
ssed) or we could assign another lawyer to completing the documentation, in=
cluding Chris Gaffney.  Please let me know.

Regards, Peter
