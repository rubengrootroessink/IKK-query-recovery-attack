Here are the credit numbers you requested.  Please note that as we
researched this we ran across discrepancies among various information
sources that we have received.  We were able to resolve some but not all.
So these are not final, but rather the ballpark figures you requested.

Sorry about the delay.

ZEV credits earned to date, by manufacturer.  This does not include vehicles
placed pursuant to manufacturer MOAs with ARB (vehicles placed for MOA
compliance do not earn ZEV credit).

Chrysler: 50
Ford:     100
GM:    1,350
Honda:     20
Toyota:   500

Aproximate total of 2,000
