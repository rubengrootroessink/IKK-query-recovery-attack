Michael,
Thank you for your prompt response today. Would it be possible for Enron
to issue a letter to Dynasty stating that they have an interest either
purchasing Dynasty's ZEV credits and/or purchasing a right to future
Dynasty credits (call provision) subject to Dynasty securing its
financing. 
If it were possible for Enron to issue this type of letter it would be
helpful in Dynasty's financing, as it shows a potential sale for
Dynasty's ZEV credit other than the ZEVXchange group.
