Michael - here is what we've found to date?is it similar to the info you've gathered?

The CARB ZEV program requires 10% of cars offered for sale
by major manufacturers in California to be zero emissions
vehicles.  A major manufacturer is one that sells 60,000 vehicles
in California per year.  This requirement is set to be effective by
the end of the model year for 2003.

These totals refer to the entire manufacturer obligation (10
percent of California sales of passenger cars and LDT1 trucks).

Approximate manufacturer ZEV credit obligations, 2003:

Daimler Chrysler:      8,000
Ford:                      19,000
GM:                       22,000
Honda:                   16,000
Nissan:                    6,000
Toyota:                   20,000

A manufacturer meets the ZEV requirement by earning credits
for each vehicle offered for sale in the state.  Partial credit (up to
60% of requirements) may be earned for ultra low emitting
vehicles.  The list below shows how many credits have been
earned so far.  There is a lag time between cars being placed on
the lots and updating of CARB's systems so the information is
not completely current.  There have also been credits issued to
minor manufacturers which are not included in the table.

Credits earned to date:

Chrysler: 50
Ford:     100
GM:    1,350
Honda:     20
Toyota:   500

Approximate total of 2,000

We are attempting to find out how many of the above credits are
from ZEVs and how many are from ultra-low emitting vehicles.
