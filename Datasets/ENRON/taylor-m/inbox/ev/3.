Sounds good.  Are you going to breakdown their financials and try and figure out what the prices of these allowances really are?  I'm back tomorrow afternoon so we'll be able to go through the stuff then.  Nice work.

The financials look bad.  Kelly says they will not get the 2.5 million.  They will probably ask to extend the sept 10th MOU with ZEVXchange.com.  The site has only a cover page.  Dynasty may have orders for 600 cars across the US.  Kelly said about 15 firm orders in CA.  This would bring number of credits to 72 in CA.  This would be worth 360,000  (assuming $5,000).  I think the company as a whole might suck but I think they may be able to sell enough cars in CA to earn us enough credits where it would be profitable to us to enter a deal.
 
 
Also, they are temporary halted until they receive financing (not producing any cars).  Kelly is going to send me info on their 3 year business plan and info about CA (number of orders and dealer info).
 
After I go through the data I will send you an update.

let me know what kelly says when you speak with him.  doesn't look too good for him, but i'll check out the exchange as well.  seems kind of strange that the deal is worth 40-50mm yet they can't raise 2.5mm.

Trevor,  

Read this two stories.  It is up to a $5,000 fine per vehicle if major corporations do meet the 10% requirement. 

What time will you be back tomorrow?  I will set up a call with president.
