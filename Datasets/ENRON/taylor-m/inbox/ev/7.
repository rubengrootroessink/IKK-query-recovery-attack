Attached to this email is copy of a public prospectus document from a financing earlier this year as well as analyst reports.
Currently the Company has 15.3 Million shares outstanding. The Company trades on the Canadian Ventures Exchange, however at the Company's request our stock has been suspended from trading until a financing can be concluded.
The Company has outstanding obligations of $2.6 Million in trade payables and $775,000 in shareholder loans.
The Company has received the following funding:
$2 Million in May 2000 from a reverse takeover of Atwood Gold
$2 Million in June 2000 from a private placement of common shares. Funds came from insiders, employees,friends, family and associates.
$2 Million in Jan. 2001 from a convertible debenture. Funds from insiders, employees, friends and associates
$1 Million March 2001 from a bridge loan with a group out of Hong Kong
In March 2001 a public offering was completed with gross proceeds of $6.5 Million and net proceeds after commissions. legal and other associated costs of $5.5 Million. The Convertible debenture funds and the bridge loans were rolled into this offering thereby eliminating any debt in the Company at that time. With the roll in of the debt financing of $3 Million the March 2001 financing netted the Company $2.5 Million in additional capital.
 
Currently the Company is seeking to secure a short term financing of $3 Million (Canadian funds) and is also working on a larger financing of $10 Million to $15 Million. The $3 Million financing is linked to funds needed to restart operations and to provide vehicles to ZevXchange LLC for sale in California. These funds would be used for immediate production restart and the funds would allow the Company time to complete a larger financing. The larger financing is required to provide adequate working capital for production ramp up, marketing and dealer development and for continuation of R&D programs. 
 
If Enron were to participate in a financing, then Dynasty could not move forward with ZevXchange LLC. This would reduce 2001 sales volumes as the majority were scheduled for ZevXchange. This reduction in sales volumes would require Dynasty to secure more than $3 million so as Dynasty could immediately begin dealer signings in California, and launch sales campaigns targeted at fleet buyers. Fleet buyers would include cities, state, universities, rentals, developers, airports and military installations which would require some discounting of selling prices. It is anticipated that without the ZevXchange LLC initial guaranteed orders that Dynasty would need to increase its initial financing to $5 Million. 
 
Dynasty's cash requirements could be met through various means and combinations including a private placement of equity; convertible debenture; loan and/or prepayment of ZEV credits.
 
If you have any questions please contact me. I can be reached on my cell phone at 250-317-5700.
Brad Imrich will be forwarding the three year forecast and Howard Wilson will forward our California plan without ZevXchange LLC sales.
