Hi Mark,

Just wanted to drop you a line to say hello.  I've been thinking about you a
lot with recent events down in Houston.  David said he's spoken with you and
you're fine.  That's good to hear!

Things are great up here.  I began work last Monday, the 22nd and have
gotten settled in quite nicely.  I really like it so far.  Everyone's very
sharp and extremely approachable.  David's been really nice in checking in
on me and has brought me in on the outsourcing initiative he's leading.

I'll go now- I know you're busy.  Have a good weekend and a better next
week!

Noble
