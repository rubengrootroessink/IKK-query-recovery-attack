Hey Mike
Due to a change of the SQL Server database, the SO2 Report program had to be modified.
Attached is the revised copy of the program.  You will need to copy the attachment to your
C:\Program Files\SO2Report directory.

While testing the revised code, I ran the latest report (dated 10/12/2001) which can now be found on the network.

Also attached is a copy of the program documentation.
Remember that data files must be kept in O:\Liquids\Liquids\Coal\SO2_Report\Files.
