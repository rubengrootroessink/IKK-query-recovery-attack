you missed the point - for asset disposal and aquisitions the parties involved - native position will change - has nothing to do with transacted volume -

This pulls the data directly from EPA website which is updated weekly (adjusted for transactions) according to the EPA.  I look at it every week to update our report.

are you making sure that all aquisition are accounted for - meaning people long/short position will change - This should be looked at on monthly basis -
