Other than the auto download portion, the SO2 Report program is just about wrapped up.  I have completed correcting the numbers for the Ending Position and the Total Market Balance Chart.  All numbers now correctly add up .  It would probably work out best if you guys could download/unzip the EPA files yourself until the auto download portion is completed.  If needed,
I can show you guys what it would entail.

Attached is the latest copy.  As usual just copy this file to C:\Program Files\SO2Report

 

Thanks
Wade
