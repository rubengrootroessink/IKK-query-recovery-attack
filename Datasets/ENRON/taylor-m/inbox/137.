                  ANNOUNCING THE EVENT NOTIFICATION SYSTEM


Because we have your e-mail address, we are TESTING a system which offers you
the opportunity to receive automatic e-mail notification of certain events
taking place in your 5th Circuit appeals. In brief, we send you an e-mail
notifying you when we:

        1. Issue a briefing notice;
        2. File and rule on motions to extend the time to file a brief, or to
        suspend briefing times;
        3. File briefs;
        4. File and act on a petition for rehearing.

You can see a complete listing of the notification events by clicking on the
link below.

          http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/attyemail/eventlist.htm

                    What does the notice look like?

You receive the publicly available docket text for these events from our
automated case processing system. You can see a sample by clicking on the
link below. This is the ONLY information you receive. You still have to access
PACERNET to view the entire docket sheet. For those events where we normally
send you a paper document, e.g. a briefing notice, you will still receive that
paper notice.

                    What is the benefit to me?

You will save time and money by not having to check your case's status on
PACERNET, and will not have to call our office to see if we have filed your or
your opponent's brief, to find out when your briefing time begins to run, or
if a rehearing petition has been filed, etc. This service is designed to benefit
you and our office. If however, we find that we are expending more resources by
operating the event notification system because we receive more telephone calls
or electronic messages etc. we will discontinue the service.

            How much does the event notification service cost?
The service is free.

                    How do I sign up for the service?

You must:

        1. Be a member of the 5th Circuit Bar;
        2. Have provided us your current e-mail address;
        3. Sign up by clicking on the  link below and filling out the required
information, or by going to our website http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov and
clicking on the "event notification" link. Note, that you can elect to start
the service now, delay receiving the service, but be left on our invitation
list, or elect not to participate and be removed from our invitation list.
You can also change your e-mail address and this will change it throughout our
automated system.

                    What if I want to stop the service?

You can discontinue the service at any time by selecting the "event notification
link" or our "website", entering your social security number and then selecting
the either of the options that de-register you from the service.

                    What if the court needs to stop the service?

This is a test service. If we find that running the event notification program
strains our limited resources, we may terminate the test.
