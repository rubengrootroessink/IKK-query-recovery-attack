Got you, thanks.  I'll look over this and see you in about an hour.

I could make those calculations, but I have only been involved with the emission allowances so far. I believe the ERCs would be calculated based on the average emissions two years prior to the shutdown. To give you are general idea, the year 2000 emissions from the plant are: 

24 tons of PM
647 tons of VOC
0.02 tons of SO2
2,406 tons of NOx
148 tons of CO

However, the VOC emissions available would be reduced by a small amount (<25 tons) because Enron is not shutting down the tank terminal and loading dock. Also the NOx ERCs will be based on the future 2007 NOx limits so they will be greatly reduced.

Marc,
Do you have the amount of ERCs that would be created by a shutdown in terms of NOx, VOC, CO, PM10, etc?
Thanks,
Trevor

The person from New York that will be on the conference today is David Openheimer. I think he is with NatSource.
