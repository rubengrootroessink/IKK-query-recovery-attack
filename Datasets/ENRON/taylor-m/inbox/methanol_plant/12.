Gentlemen,
Thank you all for taking the time to meet with us today.   I hope we were able to shed some light on what is a convoluted process.  Though the process can be difficult there is some value which we will deliver to Enron.  I've jotted down some next steps from the meeting.  Please let me know if there is anything else I can do to help.

Next Steps
1)	Find out the whether a shutdown declaration to the TNRCC would negatively impact the Methanol Plant write down.
a.	If there are negative ramifications how can they be resolved with the understanding that the units could always be restarted with the purchase of more ERCs?
i.	Brian Hendon has offered his help with your accountants and experts.
b.	The question is important because it determines whether VOC and NOx can be turned into ERCs.
i.	If there is no issue then
1.	The opportunity to monetize VOC ERCs and NOx ERCs or allowances would exist
ii.	If declaring a shutdown negatively impacts the write down: 
1.	Any present VOC value would be lost.
2.	There would be no option of taking NOx ERCs.
3.	The sole emissions value would be in the NOx allowances.
2)	Marc Phillips or Mike Taylor will check if there is any emissions penalty or devaluation for not declaring the shutdown immediately.
3)	Let's speak after we know the answers to question 1 or after Air Liquide comes in with an offer.

Thanks again for your time,
Trevor Woods
