I don't know how it happened but I have fixed my spreadsheet with the revised numbers for engine 101C. I am trying to track down the VOC emissions from the plant that could be used to calculate VOC ERCs. The person I need to talk to works the night shift at the methanol plant so I won't be able to talk to him until this evening.

Marc,

I ran the numbers, and I am attaching the same spreadsheet.  I hide the cells were I did my calculations.  Can you look at the Engine 101C, again?  That is the only set we got large differences.  If you have a chance to look at this in the morning, that would be great.  Give me a call if you have any questions.  

Also, can you narrow down anymore the VOC that would be earned?
