FYI. If you do meet with Jim Prentice, I thought you would be interested in=
 the memo I sent to him back in January. It was sent via Lotus Notes so I c=
opied the text from that message below.


Mike Terraso forwarded a question from you about the worth of emission cred=
its if the methanol plant is shut down and the credits are sold on the open=
 market. The new Houston non-attainment regulations that apply to the gener=
ation of emission credits just appeared in the Texas Register on January 9,=
 2001 so the value of the credits are very speculative at this time. Howeve=
r I will attempt to make some educated guesses about the value of the credi=
ts. Under the new rules, emission credits can be created by the shutdown of=
 the methanol plant for nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds, =
(VOCs) and carbon monoxide (CO).

Under the new rules there are three types of emission credits that would ap=
ply to the methanol plant. They are 1) Emission Reduction Credits (ERCs), 2=
) Discrete Emission Reduction Credits (DERCs) and 3) "allocations" under th=
e new cap and trade program. As an example, if you shut down an emission so=
urce that emitted 100 tons/year of a pollutant you can obtain 100 tons/year=
 of ERCs as long as no new rules are passed that would require further redu=
ction of the emissions. If you shut down the same source, you can obtain 10=
0 tons of DERCs each year until new rules are passed that would require fur=
ther reductions. ERCs and DERCs for NOx and VOC are not new and were availa=
ble under the old trading rules. ERCs and DERCs for CO are new under the ne=
w rules that just passed. Allocations under the cap and trade rules are new=
 and (for now) only apply to NOx emissions. Allocations are allotted each y=
ear to a location and form the basis for their cap. They are based on histo=
ric operating hours and the new NOx limits (e.g., 0.5 grams/hp-hr for engin=
es and 0.01 lbs/MMbtu for the reformer) and a company must buy allocations =
every year if they are over their "cap" and can sell allocations every year=
 if they are under their cap. If a plant is shutdown, you would receive all=
ocations and could sell them to other companies. Since reductions under the=
 cap and trade program start in 2004 it is anticipated allocations would be=
gin to have value in 2004.

After review of the data for the methanol plant, it appears that you would =
have approximately 500 tons/year of VOC ERCs or DERCs, 150 tons/year of CO =
ERCs or DERCs, and 85 tons/year of NOx ERCs, DERCs, or allocations, if you =
shut down the plant. You would have to make the determination whether the E=
RCs, DERCs or allocations (for NOx only) have the most value if you sell th=
e credits. It is anticipated that ERCs, which are a one-time creation, will=
 generally have a reduced value in future years because they cannot be used=
 in the cap and trade program. Allocations and DERCs can be created every y=
ear and will be needed every year by companies for compliance.

The value of VOC ERCs under the old rules typically were about $3,000/ton s=
o the value of 500 tons/year of VOC could be $1,500,000. I would not antici=
pate a great change in the value of VOC ERCs under the new rules.

CO ERCs and DERCs being new have no history, and I could not find anyone th=
at could even make an educated guess as to their value, but since the CO ru=
les are not anywhere near as stringent as the NOx and VOC rules, I would no=
t anticipate that their value would be that great.

The value of NOx ERCs under the old rules were about $3,500/ton. Under the =
new rules, the expense of putting on new controls such as selective catalyt=
ic reduction (SCR) is anticipated to be very great which should drive up th=
e price of NOx credits. Remember that companies will have to make the decis=
ion to either purchase credits or put on controls, whichever is most cost e=
ffective. TNRCC has estimated that allocations could be worth as much as $5=
0,000/ton (which would place the value of the 85 tons of NOx credits at ove=
r $4,000,000) under the new rules, but most in industry do not believe they=
 will be worth that much. A value of $3,000-25,000/ton of NOx is conceivabl=
e which would value the NOx allocations available from a shutdown at $255,0=
00 to $2,125,000. Keep in mind that the value of credits will be driven by =
market forces such as supply and demand and the cost of controls. Also reme=
mber that allocations are needed every year so this would be an annual reve=
nue stream for Enron.

Since the cap and trade program is so new and the way the rules will be imp=
lemented is still being sorted out by TNRCC, I would suggest that this info=
rmation should be updated at a later date.

If you have any questions, give me a call at 713-646-7646.
