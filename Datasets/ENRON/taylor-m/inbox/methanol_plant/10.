I don't believe that we have presented anything to them specifically relating to allowances or emission credits. We have provided information on the Houston non-attainment regulations. I've attached an environmental notice I prepared previously that is specific to Enron's assets in case you are interested.

Marc,

Have you done any presentation for the people who own the plant?  I think our group is going to sit down with them this week.  We were going to put a BASIC presentation to them on the allowances and ERCs.  You did forward the e-mail to me that you sent Jim Prentice.  Please let me know ASAP if you have any other info that you prepared for Jim or somebody else.

Thanks,
