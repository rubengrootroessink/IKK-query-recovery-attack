This has been a challenge for us in other deals - in a recent transaction
that Mary and I worked on, we had to limit the types of legal services to
be provided to ministerial/information gathering for fear of losing
privilege.  I need to think about this and talk to a couple people to see
if we can come up with a workable solution, so I'll get back to you on
this.

Subject:  Legal Support for Swapco


Any thoughts on how we provide legal support for Swapco?  Should that be
covered by the Services Agreement?  Can lawyers who work for ENA
represent Swapco without a conflict?
