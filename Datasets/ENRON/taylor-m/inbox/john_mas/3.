   Subject:  emissions market

   Dear Mr. Massey:

   I am working with the World Bank in Prototype Carbon Fund projects (i.e.
   for
   emissions reduction and associated carbon purchase).
   In particular, I am doing some research on the development of carbon
   markets in
   Latin America (e.g. potential to compete for CDM projects, carbon market
   development, participating agents, etc). I am also conducting research
   on the
   actions that multinational energy companies are taking with respect to
   the Kyoto
   Protocol.

   Thanks to my work I had the opportunity to meet Glenn Prickett,
   executive
   director of the Center for Environmental Leadership in Business at
   Conservation
   International who advised me to contact Susan Worthen at Enron. Susan
   also
   contacted me with Mr. Henry Van who mentioned that you are the director
   of Enron
   Emission Allowances.

   If possible, could you send me some information on Enron's development
   in carbon
   markets and in general on the Enron's experience in emissions trading?.
   Also,
   let me know if I can call you to have a brief conversation.

   All the best,

   Gabriela Elizondo



   I wish to express my condolences to the people of America.
