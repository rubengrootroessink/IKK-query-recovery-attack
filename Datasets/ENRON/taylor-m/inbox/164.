Mark,
The issues and unexecuted confirms are mounting where we need legal's help.  The attached list represents those issues.  I would like to sit down and discuss an action plan for addressing these issues.  I will have Holly set up a meeting for us to discuss.

Please see the attached list which details items pending for legal review and comments. The list details the issue by counterparty and the number of unsigned transactions as a result of the issue.  Can you provide me with an update as to where we stand on each item or if there is additional information needed from the confirmation team?  I would like to know which attorney has each particular Counterparty issue.  Thanks for your assistance.
