	Curriculum Review Task Force
	Report # 11 (December 4, 2001)

The draft educational goals were reviewed in a "committee of the whole"
discussion at the November faculty meeting. Several good suggestions were
made during the nearly one-hour discussion. The current secretary of the
task force, Ms. Susan Dagit, took extensive notes of this discussion. In
addition, two faculty members provided some written comments after the
meeting. The task force is currently working on the revision of the
educational goals based on the suggestions made by the faculty.

The task force has also been planning for a while the work to be done after
the educational goals are finalized. The November 26 meeting was fully
devoted to this discussion. The following steps are envisaged at this time:

1.	To examine carefully the current academic program on the basis of
the educational goals.

2.	To keep on the table the curricular initiatives which came out of
the Purser-Gans conference and the intensive summer work.

3.	To develop a four-year matrix for a well-planned integrated
curriculum based on items 1 and 2 above.

4.	To continue deliberations on calendar, organizational structure,
workload and other issues which have a direct bearing on the curriculum.

Full details of these discussions are available in the detailed minutes
posted in the public folders. To access them, please go to Public Folders,
