As you may know, Kathleen Carnahan, our sr. specialist who sits with Ben Jacoby's Asset Development group on 31, will be moving over to Enron South on the 14th of November.  She would like to place a five drawer filing cabinet next to the two cabinets (Stuart's files) near the North Stairwell on  38.  Any problems with this?
