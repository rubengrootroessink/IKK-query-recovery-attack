Kathryn -

Below are the annex and amendment for Cargill and (per Brent) the updated Entergy-Koch agreements.

These can be released to the customers, subject to the caveat that I had in my earlier e-mail messages.  My strong suggestion is to have both of these companies, if they have comments, to have them mark or note their comments and forward them to me.  I will work with Brent to address their comments.

I hope to have Williams to you tomorrow.

Mark
