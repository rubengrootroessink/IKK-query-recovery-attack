I was informed by Steve Douglas this morning that for tax reasons we need t=
o assign a number of weather transactions ENA entered into with XL Trading =
Partners Ltd. from ENA to Chiricahua III LLC and Chiricahua V LLC.  These t=
wo entities are ultimately wholly owned subsidiaries of ENA.  It is intende=
d that these entities will also enter into a few weather transactions direc=
tly with XL Trading Partners Ltd.  All of these transactions must have a te=
rm that ends no later than midnight December 31 2001. My understanding is t=
hat some time after these transactions are assigned or entered into the Chi=
ricahua entities will be liquidated sometime during the month of December a=
nd the weather transactions will be transferred to the parent entity which =
will subsequently be liquidated and moved to its parent and so on until the=
 transactions end up at ENA.  I would ask Bret or Steve to clarify the proc=
ess to the extent that I have left anything out or misstated the proposal i=
n broad terms.  If anyone needs a detailed explanation of the process pleas=
e call Bret at ext. 54390.

I would ask that everyone review the attached documentation in light of the=
 proposal above to give their views from a credit, Dynegy merger agreement,=
 legal, operational, commercial, corporate governance, and guarantor perspe=
ctive.

I am proposing the following draft documents for the assignment of the ENA =
trades to Chiricahua III and V entities. =20

 << File: ChiricahauIIIAssignment11-19-01.doc >>  << File: ChiricahauVAssig=
nment11-19-01.doc >>=20

I am proposing the following blacklined draft master agreements to be enter=
ed into between Chiricahua III and V and XL Trading Partners Inc.  These ar=
e based on the executed ENA/XL Trading master.  Please note that Chiricahua=
 and XL Trading would be providing parent guaranties in the form previously=
 agreed upon by ENA and XL Trading.  Deb, please note the documents to be d=
elivered section for the Chiricahua entities.  Will we need some new resolu=
tions passed?

I am attaching final drafts of the confirmations that were entered into bet=
ween the parties.  The first six will be assigned to Chiricahua III and the=
 second six will be assigned to Chiricahua V.  Rebecca, please note that I =
will need copies of the executed confirmations for these transactions or th=
e document that we sent to XL Trading if they have not yet signed the docum=
ent by tomorrow midday if at all possible so I can attach them as exhibits.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments on the documentati=
on.  If you have any comments or questions relating to the tax purpose or p=
rocess of this series of transactions please call Bret Well at ext. 54390.
