Brent -

My inclination is to not stray from the ETA languauge and warranties.  If there are technical problems, we should probably investigate this with the EOL team and determine why the integrity of the data is suspect.  I would think this problem is not isolated to Williams.  

I'll talk to Mark.

Mark and Mark,
I sent out a blacklined document with the additional changes on Friday and we received this today.  Kim is following up to find out what they mean by significant problems with the integrity of the data.  How do we respond to the warranty issues they raise?

 We just thought we were going to get this signed. The Confirmations supervisor has some problems as outlined below. Can we fix this in the amendment?  Do you want us to send language? 
I would like to hold off executing this amendment until we can include a warranty provision (including remedies) regarding the accuracy of the "electronic records of the EOL transactions" . This is a result of:
?       the current EOL service agreement disclaims all warranties as to the accuracy of the website information (Sec 4.b of the service agreement)

?       the amendment in its current form does not warrant the accuracy of the electronic information, yet it will replace the confirmation, and

?       we are currently experiencing significant problems with the integrity of the data obtained from the website,  which I would have to assume would be the same data that would replace the confirmations.
