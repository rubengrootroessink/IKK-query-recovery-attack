I had a good visit with her on the issues.  She advised that she is on a task force to add amendments to the revised 9 in Delaware and thought the group might entertain favorably an exception for master netting agreements from the anti-restriction/assignment receivable issue.  She will work on this for us if we want her to.  I think we should--at least it would be a start and an example.  Do you think there would be great risk in applying Delaware law to the master netting agreements rather than New York?  Let's talk.  Call me Monday.

Cordially,
