Current systems calculate the margin requirement for spread positions by
first determining the "Scan Risk" and then multiplying the number of spreads
by a rate set by the Exchange.  Scan Risk is determined by netting the
outright margin required for each leg of a spread.  Spreading between
differently margined contracts results in a higher spread margin than
between equally margined contracts.  Below is provided an example where the
legs of a spread are margined differently.
Scan Risk Example at Clearing Member Rates
A spread consisting of one futures leg in Tier 1 and another in Tier 2 will
have its requirement (at the clearing member rates) calculated at $1,000
starting on Monday, December 03, 2001.

One Long Tier 1 NG or NN	(1 * $4,500)			=
$4,500
One Short Tier 2 NG or NN	(1 * $4,000)			=	-
$4,000
Net Scan Risk		($4,500-$4,000)			=		$
500
Spread Rate			(1* $500)			=	+
$   500
Total Requirement						=
$1,000
