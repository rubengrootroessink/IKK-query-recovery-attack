Please review the last change made to the Annex.  I tried to fix the ECC/ENA problem as simply as possible.

Gayla,
While I was getting ready to prepare execution copies I was notified of some additional language that is being added to our template that helps clarify a few issues.  I was asked to send you a blacklined draft for review.  Please also forward a copy of the blacklined draft to Tracy and if either of you have any questions regarding the changes please let me know.  The last change in the Annex is still being finalized but I included it so you could review the language/concept.

Regards,
Brent
