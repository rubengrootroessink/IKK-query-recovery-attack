I assume the "Mark" below means you.  Also, I wanted to get your straight-from-the-horse's-mouth opinion on EOL clearing services and the attendant CFTC issues.  Let's talk later today, if you're in.

Thanks,
Brad

John Arnold asked me this morning about individuals on EOL.  Apparently,. John was told that I had a problem with this.  I haven't had a conversation on this since 1999,. At that time I sidelined the issue as it was complex, bearing in mind everything else that was going on.  I would suggest you and Mark address tis together.
I have no idea who told John this as I haven't had a dizcussion on this issue since 1999.
