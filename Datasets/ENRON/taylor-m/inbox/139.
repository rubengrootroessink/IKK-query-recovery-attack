		The presentation will be given by Thomas D. Carmel, Conoco,
on Issues in the Creation of Information Security & Analysis Centers (ISACs)
and will be held at the Houston Center Club, 1100 Caroline St., Houston,
Texas, beginning at 12:00 Noon.

		The price for the program is $25 for members with
reservations; $27 for members at the door; and $30 for non-members.
Contact Mark T. Curry at (713) 759-0818 or e-mail him at Mtc@hwallp.com for

		No Show Penalty:  If you make a reservation, you are
expected to pay if you do not cancel by 2:00 p.m. on the Friday before the
seminar.  The Club bills the Section according to the number of reservations
and the Section cannot afford to cover costs of those who neither attend nor
timely cancel their reservations.
