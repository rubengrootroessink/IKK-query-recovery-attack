Hello 

My name is John Poundstone. I manage my family's farm in 
Northern California. 

The attached Excel file details ERCs our family has for sale in 
Colusa County, California. Under California law, phasing out the 
burning of rice straw, our family was able to certify our emission 
tonnage. 

We are in an "attainment area" and if the Rice portion of the 
credits are sold to a "non attainment area", EPA phases that 
portion of our tonnage down to 38%. If sold within the area, EPA, 
hopefully, is not involved and there is no phase down. 

We have been negotiating with Reliant Energy to sell our PM10 and 
SOx for use at their proposed 500 mw plant to be built in Colusa 
County. Our PM10 will meet approximately 20% of their facility's 
needs. We have been negotiating with a local vegetable oil 
company for our ROG and NOx. 

I have heard your company has been active in the California market 
and I wanted to see if your company might have interest in our 
credits. 

I may be reached at the following phone numbers: 
Mobile 530-304-0083 - will get quickest response 
Ranch Office 530-437-2486 
Home Office 530-662-9244 
email: jlbstone@sbcglobal.net  <mailto:jlbstone@sbcglobal.net>

I look forward to your response. 

Sincerely, 
John Poundstone
