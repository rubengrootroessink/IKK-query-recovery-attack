Thanks Mark. I will get Credit approval. Once you have ISDA documentation that is satisfactory, please forward and I will endeavor to get it executed.

Thanks for your help.

Bryant

I have taken a quick look at the schedules attached and unfortunately they are not standard ISDA schedules and are not in a form to which we can agree.  We can provide ISDA documentation to you tomorrow which would be satisfactory from a legal perspective but it will not be exactly the form attached to their e-mail.  We will also need Credit's approval and they rarely approve ISDA masters without any credit provisions.  There is an existing ISDA between ENA and an entity called Entergy-Koch Trading, LP which we would be able to use from our side but I don't know if that would work for them.  (It's existence might speed the negotiation process for an ISDA since we could pretty much duplicate its terms [except for credit and the additional provisions we require for regulated utilities] for Entergy.)
