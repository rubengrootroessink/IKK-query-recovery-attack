Thanks for your thoughts Mark.  I may call you as well.  I think we have it
worked out.  I was able to change the return flight to tomorrow.  I am
working on putting together a quick trip out West as a consolation for
Amanda.  She always wanted to see Grand Canyon.  I know that pales in
comparison to a Paris cafe but it will have to do for now.  I am generally
dismissive of the risks of travelling but this event has affected me deeply.
And I think you are right that Amanda hasn't felt that yet.  I would love to
ignore it or downplay it but I can't.

Do you know of any spa/resort type places in the Southwest that would meet
the Hayman standard?  (I know you know what I mean by the Hayman standard).

Thanks again, Bill.

I'm surprised that under the circumstances American won't just do it.
Linda and I both had to reschedule our flights and did it directly with the
airline (Continental for me and Virgin for Linda).  Of course, in our cases
the original flights were cancelled.  I don't have the Cunard reservations
number here and haven't been able to access the web site this afternoon.  I
will get it for you when I get home.  The fax number for the guest
relations department is (305)463-3030.

In a sense I felt safer in London than here.  Once we got off the QE2 we
weren't doing anything that would have made us attractive targets and I
don't anticipate attacks against individual Americans overseas -- at least
not outside of Muslim countries.  While there was an increase in police
presence around town, we didn't hear of any actual threats to Americans
while we were in London.  Airport security has been better there than here
for a long time and now has been beefed up even further.  The Europeans
just have more recent experience at dealing with terrorists than we do.
The sword rattling doesn't bother me too much.  I've been overseas during
some tense international times before and as long as you're in a friendly
country it shouldn't be an issue.  On the other hand, it REALLY feels good
to be home and I can sure understand your wanting to have her with you.

From her point of view, I think that while the Brits were all being very
sympathetic and supportive, the tragedy just isn't as immediate there and
so the impact on Amanda has been somewhat less than if we had been home.
Given that, I think she doesn't want to waste this opportunity to do
something fun in Europe while she has the chance and is already over there.
For me I have to say it was hard to have any fun after Tuesday noon,
although I tried to put a good face on it.  I don't know when that will
improve since I'm still pretty depressed.  It's probably even worse for you
since you were so much closer to things than I am.  The lawyer in me sees
two sides: (a) a trip to Paris is just the thing to take your mind off of
events and (b) why waste a week of vacation and travel hassles when you
aren't going to have a good time no matter where you go.

Feel free to give me a call if you want to chat.

Good luck!

Mark

   Mark -- I am trying to reschedule Amanda's return ticket.  I understand
   from
   American that I have to do it through Cunard.  Do you have a contact
   over
   there?  If not I'll just do the 800 number thing.

   I want her to come home.  We will take a stateside vacation over the
   next
   week and not linger over there.  What is your opinion?  Did you feel
   unsafe
   there?  There is a lot of sword rattling going on right now.

   Bill
