 << File: NOx SIP CALL Q&A.doc >>=20

Michael - the above Q&A document for the EPA discusses the compliance suppl=
ement pool questions you raise.  The document is dated - so the dates are n=
o longer accurate given the court delays of the SIP Call implementation.  B=
ut basically, it is up to each state to develop a methodology for allocatin=
g their compliance supplement pool.  The CSP is meant to give credits to un=
its that make early reductions.  The compliance supplement pool (roughly 20=
0,000 allowances for the NOx SIP Call) is only good for the first two years=
 of a state's launch of its NOx SIP Call.  Those allowances that aren't all=
ocated during these first two years are retired.

Ok.  The file you sent me contains the total trading budget and CSP.  The s=
tates total allowances equal the total trading budget and the CSP?  Is the =
CSP a one time allocation in SIP CALL while total trading budget is annuall=
y?  If CSP is only a one time allocation, have the states determined how ma=
ny allowances from the CSP will be used in 04? 05? etc.  Or is there some o=
ther method that I am missing?    =20

These are the compliance supplement numbers for the NOx SIP Call not the OT=
R compliance supplement numbers which are roughly 25,000 tons.

On the state file.  The CSP of each state added together is way above 25,00=
0.  Why is this?  How should I look at this CSP?  Is there a discount facto=
r that will be applied to get down to the 25,000 at the end of 2002.  If so=
, what is it?

Should I add them all together and get a percent per state?  And then multi=
ply the percent by 25,000 to determine the state's CSP at the end of 2002? =
 Please advise.

Michael - I haven't heard back from Joel yet on a call date & time, but her=
e is some of the info I promised.  Attached is the latest information I hav=
e on the state allocations, including their total trading budgets:

 << File: State.htm >>=20


Also attached, is the Section 126 Non-EGU allocations:

 << File: Sec. 126 NonEGU affected units.pdf >>=20

I am pretty sure this is all the non-EGUs that will affected in those state=
s under the SIP Call, but am double checking just to be completely sure.

I am still working on a date that the allowances have to be parked in the c=
ompliance supplement pool in 2002 to be valid in 2003. =20

I'll let you know as soon as I have some more answers.
