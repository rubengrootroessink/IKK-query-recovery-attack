Attached is a memo I provided to EES on the emissions markets in the SCAQMD.  Thought you might find it useful.  It is amazing how totally mucked up and confused the market is there.   Please let me know if you have any other info.  This is for a potential very small DG project - but it will probably still meet the 4 ton per year threshold.
