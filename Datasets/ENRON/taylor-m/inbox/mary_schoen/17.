Xcel will spend $68
million installing scrubbers, which are
expected to reduce emissions by 80 pct
below current levels. The new
equipment is expected to be fully
operational by Jan.1, 2003. The
emission equipment upgrade is part of
a voluntary program, first announced
in 1997, to reduce emissions from Xcel's
Denver plants by 70 pct for SO2 and by
40 pct for NOX from uncontrolled
levels. All the improvements are
expected to be operational by 2003,
and will be paid through a 15-year
surcharge to customers' bills.
