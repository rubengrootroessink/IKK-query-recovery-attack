Mark,
You have been in mind for days, longer in fact.  Every time I read about
Enron I think of you, and life has been scattered so I have not been able to
write.

Since the news now seems to be that your company is being bought by another,
it must be chaotic for you.  Let me know how you are and what is happening.
No doubt you will survive the mess, but hope it is not taking too much out
of you.

We are slowly getting back to normal, and every trip out of NY it great as I
am very tired of police check points and ID's.  Our building is livable now
for about a month, but still behind a barricade.  My mother has been in and
out of hospital, and so that has kept me stressed.  I sold a house in KW in
late Sept, so came down then for the closing.  Hated going back to NY as we
were still living in a hotel then....

I am in KW now, much enjoying being able to work here but missing Don.  Back
to NY next week, then here again end of month.  Planning a new addition on
the house, which is trying.  The little house next door is coming up for
rent as of Dec 1, in case you are interested, and I have decided to only
rent it to a single guy...Maybe you need a little winter getaway??

All best,
Hal
