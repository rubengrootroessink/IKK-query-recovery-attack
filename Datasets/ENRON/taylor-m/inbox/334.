We are having Thanksgiving dinner here at our house.  Saturday, if the
weather is decent, you might be interested in seeing Pyramid Hill, a
sculpture park.   It isn't open on Friday.  Friday we might go to one or
more of the art museums in town, or there is a fairly new aquarium over
in Kentucky we haven't seen yet.  So I guess casual is the theme for the
weekend.  There is a show at the Aronoff Center called, "Blast."  Have
you heard anything about it?  Dad's boss and wife went and liked it a
lot.  It sounds something like a cross between a marching band and
Riverdance, if you can imagine it.  If that sounds interesting to you, we
will see if we can get tickets for Friday night.  But that could  be just
dressy casual, I should think.

Love, Mother
