Mark,

I have attached a document which contains the long descriptions for Canadian Daily Nat Gas options.  The trader will be using Options Manager on these products and because he has to choose an exercise date, he will choose a middle of the month business day.  However, there will be an option per day during the term.  Please review the descriptions the trader put together and let me know your thoughts.
