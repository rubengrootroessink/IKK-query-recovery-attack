Mark,
This is a brief overview of what the tax group is trying to accomplish overall but does not really explain why assigning the derivative positions from ENA or entering into new weather derivative positions in the Chiricahua entities allows Enron to save 500mm in taxes.  Stephen told me on Friday he would speak with you today to answer your question on how aggressive the tax position is.
Regards,
Brent
