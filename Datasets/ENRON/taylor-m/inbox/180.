Lindsay, the attached content packet is hereby approved by me on behalf of the legal department, subject to the following:

(1)  This document -- the "Tender Instruction Schedule" -- is to go on the garden page

 

(2)  The attached gtc's are approved by me on behalf of the legal department, and are ready to upload.  I note that these gtc's have the general "Collateral Arrangement" provisions (Section 13) for EOL gtc's.  If credit approves certain counterparties for whom we do not need this Section 13, let me know if you need me to do anything re that.
