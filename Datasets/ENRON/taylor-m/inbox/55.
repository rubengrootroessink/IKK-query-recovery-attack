The files that were given to me have been reassigned within the group.  I resolved Morgan Stanley Cap Group and sent a signed global confirmation acceptance  to Todd D.  As to EES, I was working with Sarah Dietrich, attorney with EES, but could never get them to execute since officers would not do so on the basis of the internal "reorg" issues.  Sarah was going to continue to work on this.

Please see the attached list which details items pending for legal review and comments. The list details the issue by counterparty and the number of unsigned transactions as a result of the issue.  Can you provide me with an update as to where we stand on each item or if there is additional information needed from the confirmation team?  I would like to know which attorney has each particular Counterparty issue.  Thanks for your assistance.
