We have been asked by our commercial people to advise them with respect to legal issues surrounding the online trading of forest products in the following Asian countries: Japan/ The Phillipines/ Taiwan/ The Peoples Republic of China/  Thailand/ Singapore/ India/ Malaysia/ Indonesia/ Australia/ New Zealand/ Vietnam/ Hong Kong...They are focused on two issues..what do we need to do to give customers access to our online trading platform and what do  we need to do to allow them to execute transactions on our platform...the can of worms is, of course,  much bigger than those seemingly simple questions,  such as in terms of tax issues, regulation and "doing business" issues, FCPA, etc, etc....If any of you have any existing research that might help us or a suggestion for appropriate counsel, please contact me or Deb Korkmas...Thanks
