Kim and Mark:

Could you please coordinate the legal process to generate the necessary amendments for Williams.  Our marketing team has indicated a strong interest in ConfirmLogic from Williams.  We would like the amendments to be presented to Williams when their due diligence process begins.  Paul is coordinating with Williams the timing of the due diligence.  

Thank You for your cooperation,

Kathryn
