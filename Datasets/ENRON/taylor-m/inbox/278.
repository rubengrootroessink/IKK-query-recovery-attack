These changes account for the fact that the UK regulatory body is changing from the Securities and Futures Authority (SFA) to the Financial Services Authority (FSA).  This amendment to the Legal & Privacy Statement  has been approved by Ian Brungs and Jonathan Marsh in the UK and Mark Greenberg in the US.
