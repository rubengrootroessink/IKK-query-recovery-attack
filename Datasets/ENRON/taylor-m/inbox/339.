Cleaning out my mailbox, and I find this message from John Perschke reporting
on homecoming, and requesting I sent you a note. Sorry to delay; things have
been just exquisitely busy here at work the past few months. So I'll send a
quick note, and more when I hear back from you (the email address looks
suspicious, so I'll verify it first). Big project is just wrapping up, so I'll
have more spare minutes soon, I hope.

Hope all is well with you. Still in Houston?
