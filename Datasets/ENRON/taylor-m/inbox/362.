Attached is the draft proposal for the TVA peakers.  Please have a look and provide any comments.

Please confirm the bid prices you provided earlier and I used for the option pricing:

2004 to 2007 average NOx price = $3000/ton
2008 = $1000/ton

Also, please provide an idea of the value to the desk of this transaction (i.e. bid to offer spread), so that I can properly quantify the value of the transaction to Enron in my discussions with George. (Each unit provides about 600 tons per season,there are 8 units and we have a call option for 5 years starting in 2004).


Thanks
