Mark,

We have a slight change in the priorities for the ConfirmLogic items.  The companies listed below are now in order of priority (assuming a Nov. 15-16 deadline, if possible).  There are no changes to the dates for the other items.

	Cargill
	Entergy-Koch (it is my understanding that you have one more review to complete before you release these amendments)
	Bank of America
	Williams

Due to the complexities around Morgan Stanley, they should fall off the list for now.  Doug or Kathryn will let you know if the situation changes.

Thanks,

Susan

Thanks for the dates.  I will work to meet them, but want you to know that I will be out of the office at a training class on both the 13th and 14th.  The ConfirmLogic items that are listed for those days will have to be due on Nov.15.  Further, I understand that the Morgan Stanley agreements may not be ISDA's.  If this is the case, I will not be working on them and would have to have others in our group do the work (which is not a priority at this time).

Mark

The due dates (in order of priority) are indicated below.  I know next week is tough, but they are our goal dates.  I'm out tomorrow, so please contact Doug with any questions.

Thanks,

Susan

Good Morning Mark,
