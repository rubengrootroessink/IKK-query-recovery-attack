Hi Mark,

I'm fairly flexible on my housing so let me know if there would be a closer
place to stay in relationship to our dinner spot. I'm thinking of staying
out by Hobby Airport just off of 45. I should finish my meeting with Bill
Winslade (out in Friendswood) around 5:30 and be ready to meet you for
dinner. I can drive into the city if you would like. The next morning I will
travel to the Petroleum club to meet Bob Ardell for a early lunch and then
fly to Dallas for visits.

Thanks,

Dick
