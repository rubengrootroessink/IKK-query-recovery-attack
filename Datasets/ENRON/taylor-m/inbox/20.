I will try too, but I can't seem to get through to any number in NYC.  Karen Muchunas told me she cannot get through via phone to the US at all.  She has been emailing.

Linda, I will try to call her, but I have not yet been able to get through to NYC on the phone.  I will keep trying, however, and let you know thru Mark.

Hope everyone we know is well.  The pictures we are seeing in London are
devastating.  I am not able to get back tomorrow and will let you know when
I have flight arrangements.  I'm sending this to the two of you in the hope
that one of you will be checking e-mail from home.  I must make
arrangements to have the cats fed and watered until I return but I am
unable to reach NYC by phone.  Will one of you if you get this message
please call Lisa Swerdlow and ask her if she can continue feeding and
watering the cats every day until I return.  I am sorry I don't have Lisa's
number with me.  She lives in Manhattan on the West side in the 80's and I
know her number is listed.  Will one of you please call and ask her to take
care of the cats.
