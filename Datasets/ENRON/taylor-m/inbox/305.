> UTILITY BANKRUPTCY ISSUES IN A DEREGULATED ENVIRONMENT
> 
> 
> Utility bankruptcies have been a rare occurrence because electric power
> has been a heavily regulated industry.  There have been three electric
> investor-owned utility bankruptcies since the Depression:  Public Service
> Company of New Hampshire, El Paso Electric Company, and recently, Pacific
> Gas & Electric Company.  There have been several other bankruptcy filings
> by Cajun Electric Power Cooperative, Inc., Big Rivers Electric Corp.,
> Colorado-Ute Electric Association, Inc., Eastern Maine Electric
> Cooperative, Inc., and Wabash Valley Power Association.  Tucson Electric
> Power also was subject to an involuntary bankruptcy petition filing.
> However, as the march of deregulation continues, electric utilities'
> exposure to risk (in counter-party arrangements and corporate guarantees),
> multiple jurisdictional regulatory review, and cross border transactions,
> may increase the likelihood of utility bankruptcies.
> 
> A recent presentation prepared for the prestigious annual Regulatory
> Policy Conference of The Institute of Public Utilities is provided for
> your reference and use.
