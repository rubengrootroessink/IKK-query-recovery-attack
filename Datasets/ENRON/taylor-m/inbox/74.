Kevin and Chris:

The spread looks fine except for one minor point.  I'd included a parenthet=
ical defined term at the end fo section (A) of the product long description=
 so that it would be clear in section (B) that Firm (LD) energy was as defi=
ned in Schedule P of the EEI agreement.  You deleted the reference.  Please=
 include the parenthetical or give me a call to discuss leaving it out if y=
ou prefer.

Thanks,

Leslie
