I knew Sarah Armstrong.  She actually gave Mieng & I all her test files
for several classes, which came in very useful.  By looking at them, she
made great grades--whether she had someone else's test files and
programs to look at to do her's with, I don't know.  She could have done
that or done them on her own.  Either way, she got pretty good grades.

She looked like a Sigma (short blond hair, never or rarely wore
makeup--that I saw--, dressed plainly).  I don't know if she was one or
not.  You could look at the Sigma website to see.
http://www.trinity.edu/student_org/sigmas/sigmas.htm  She looks kinda
like that Sigma that was head of Greek Council, but not.  She was pretty
smart.  But I never knew her personally--just knew who she was.

Yeah, I've got a job for the moment.  Good to hear that my daughter is
doing well.  I'm glad I get to see her this weekend.  I miss that little
mutt.  Question: Do you know a girl named Sarah Armstrong?  A dude I
know @
work was asking me about her b/c they're on the same flag football team.
She graduated from Trinity in 2000, and works @ Exxon.  She might have
been
an enthusiast @ Trinity b/c she's in IT now, but he wasn't sure.  Write
me
back.  love ya

   Yes, I worked that long.  And probably late all week this week and
next.
   Who knows when it will end.  But hey, at least I have a job...

   My mom says Miss Dixie is doing fine, misses me bunches, and seems to
be
   getting into loads of mischief (as usual).  I get the feeling she's
VERY
   ready for her to come back and live with me.  Too bad she can't until
   after Thanksgiving.  And if I keep working late, it might be until
   Christmas.  I just don't feel good about keeping her locked up in my
   apartment if I continue to work long hours and don't have time to
   exercise her and play with her.  We'll see how things go.

   Still got a job?
