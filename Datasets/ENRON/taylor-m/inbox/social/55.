Hey!  Sorry for not chatting with you on Friday - it was crazy busy here to
say the least.  We are having department meetings today so if I find out
anything interesting, I'll let you know.  I'm not sure what this entails
just yet but I think, together, these companies will do great things.  I'm
excited to say we're co-workers!!!

I went back to the Homecoming game this weekend and I had a blast!  Do you
go back to any games much?

Hope you're having a great day.  I'll talk to you soon.

Jess

Jessica,

Well, it looks like we may be co-workers.  I am under the coal and
emissions umbrella over hear which is a pretty good group.  I guess we
will have it wait and see how things fold out.

Let's stay in touch over this process.  I saw Patrick this weekend at
Woodrow's.

Let me know what's up.

Mike
