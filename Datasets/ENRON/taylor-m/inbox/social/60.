Hey Mike!

Hope you had a great thanksgiving weekend. I used it to check out NYC!

Anyway, what's your take on the future of the firm? And how are the
employees reacting so far? It's difficult to recall a weekday when the
WSJ does not carry an
Enron-related article. And now it seems the merger is doubtful.
