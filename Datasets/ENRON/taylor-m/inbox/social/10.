Pinehurst- $35
Clear Creek- $27
Hermann Park- $27
Magnolia Creek (League City)- $45

These are all twilight rates (ie. mid afternoon and on).  Magnolia Creek is a lot of fun I think, if you're willing to pay the price and willing to make the drive.  It's nice, long, new... it's a European style links course.

Ryan,

My roomate was asking me what golf courses we play besides Memorial.  Can you email a few with price estimates?
