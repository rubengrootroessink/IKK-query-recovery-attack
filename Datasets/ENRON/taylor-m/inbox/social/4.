Dear Robert,

Fabulous Fall Getaways

The days are already shorter and cooler than they were in August, but not to
worry; fall sales are starting to get hot. Act quickly and you can save on
fall travel to destinations around the world, from leaf-peeping jaunts in
the Northeast to island getaways and everything in between. Wherever you're
headed, Travelocity makes planning and booking a breeze.
