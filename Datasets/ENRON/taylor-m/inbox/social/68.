Although many of you may think that  this has been a real hassle for me... =
it hasn't.... I haven't had much to do until yesterday.  I basically got pa=
id to put this together Monday...so no thanks needed.  I should be thanking=
 you all for having phone numbers and locations, and even names. It gave me=
 something to do. I am a lot busier now, so do not fret... I will not be go=
ing crazy anytime in the near future (from lack of things to do - it seems =
it may be the opposite problem now). If anyone sees a tall, blond girl outs=
ide the 21st window, just wave, because that's me! Hope you are all having =
a wonderful day and let me know if you need anything.
