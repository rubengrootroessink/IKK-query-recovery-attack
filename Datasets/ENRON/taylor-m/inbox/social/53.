Trevor,
 
In our meeting with ENSR on Tuesday we discussed their competitors and they mentioned URS.  URS is a very large environmental engineering firm based in San Francisco.  We have already established a relationship with URS.   I think these guys are a good fit for Emissions credits and would like to set up a call.  Please let me know your availability.
 
Thanks!
