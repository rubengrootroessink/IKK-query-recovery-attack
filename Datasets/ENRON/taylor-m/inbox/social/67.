An alliance of all 12 SEC Alumni Clubs, called The SEC Clubs of Houston, has scheduled a night of bragging and socializing:
 

SEC KICK-OFF SOCIAL
Thursday August 9, 2001
Ruggles at Enron Field, Center Field patio area
Beginning at 5:30 PM till...
 
Special Guest:

Skip Bertman
LSU Athletic Director and recently retired LSU baseball coach

Happy hour drink prices and selected 1/2 price appetizers all night.
 
$5 cover per person.  
Money goes to cover the cost of facility use (approx $3), pay our few expenses, and the rest will be split evenly among the participating SEC Clubs for use in our scholarship or Philanthropy funds.
 
Raffle, $1 per ticket for SEC paraphernalia.
We will also have a live auction for an official SEC football autographed by all 12 SEC football coaches.
 
NO RSVP REQUIRED.
WOULDN'T IT BE A SHAME IF GEORGIA, OR TENNESSEE, OR AUBURN, OR...ANY SCHOOL (other than LSU, They have a large local club of 600) to have a larger crowd in attendance than THE HOUSTON GATORS.  This is an opportunity for THE HOUSTON GATORS to show other Houston Area SEC Clubs how proud we are of THE FLORIDA GATORS.
 
LSU is expecting 200, Miss St 100, Vanderbilt 10, Florida....well I told them we should see 50-75 in attendance.  It sure would be GREAT TO BE A FLORIDA GATOR, SAY IT'S GREAT.., Sorry I got too excited, It sure would be great if we could have 500 Houston Area Gators in attendance.
 
WEAR YOU GATOR COLORS...SHOW OUR SPIRIT!
 
Tentative schedule of events:
5:30 - 6:30 Social hour
6:30 - 7:00 Skip Bertman
7:00 - 7:30 Raffle drawings (must be present)
7:45 - 8:00 Football auction
8:00 - till  eat, drink, and BE PROUD TO BE A GATOR
 
We are expecting TV and radio coverage.
 
The primary purpose of The SEC Clubs of Houston is to promote the SEC and our Alumni Clubs around the Houston area.
We have sent a letter to to Houston Chronicle requesting additional coverage of SEC sports.  We believe as a group we have more power to affect change.
 
Go Gators!!

I need your input...
 
The SEC Clubs of Houston (an alliance of all SEC alumni clubs in the Houston area) is planning an event for August 9, 2001.  This event, SEC Kick-Off Social, will invite all SEC clubs in the Houston area, members, friends, guests, etc. to come to Ruggles at Enron Field to socialize and brag (lie in some cases).
 
To determine an estimate of the number of attendees we are polling our membership to estimate the number of people from each club which would be interested in attending.  THIS IS NOT IN ANY WAY A BINDING RSVP.  Just an estimate to determine if Ruggles at Enron Field will be big enough.
 
So, if you would be interested in attending, please reply ASAP.
If you are not interested please reply also....
I send out a few reply requests and receive very few replies...I wonder if anyone is really out there.....
 
There is not a baseball game at Enron Field that night.




We hope to have an SEC football autographed by all 12 SEC head coaches for auction.
 
I would hope we could represent the Houston Gator Club and The University of Florida well.  Florida is the third or fourth largest club in the area (behind LSU, Miss St, and Ole MIss) so I would hope to show up strong.  LSU figures to have 150-200...
