For our trip to Las Vegas, NV I have come up with the following plans.  For
more information you can call 512 231-0221 or of course, go on-line.

Hotel:  Xcalibur
     This hotel is a 3 of 5 star hotel, but still supposed to be extremely
nice and yet affordable.  It is located on the South end of the strip 1
mile from the airport and is across the street from MGM, NYNY, and the
Luxor (or so I have been told).  It is about average pricing and the theme
is a castle with a moat that takes you back to the medeival days of King
Arthur.

Dates:  November 16 (Friday) - November 18 (Sunday)
     This is the weekend before Thanksgiving, as a side note.

Times of flights and prices: (Please be aware this is just one place I
called at the number above, it may be possible to get better deals on the
internet, etc.)
