Mark, do you want me to assist on this  AND do you have a response to my voicemail of this morning concerning an exclusion of European companies from our third party posting pop-up language.....Bob may be  merely referring to the fact that current third party postings would be of interest only to domestic Counterparties; however, I don't recall any discussion of excluding European counterparties..do you...I wanted to be sure there was no historical issue prior to calling Bob back   thanks  bng

Mark, 
I would appreciate it if you could get back to me as soon as possible on the issue of Enron's continued use of the HPL name on the EOL documents. In my letter of September 27th,  I had requested Enron remedy this situation by October 1st but that has not happened. I'm sure you can appreciate our interest in resolving this matter promptly, so please let me hear from you as soon as possible. 
Thank you,
