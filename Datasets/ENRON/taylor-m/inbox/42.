Mark, 
FYI - in case you were waiting for the weather derivatives document about which Vicki Sharp left you a message yesterday.

I am in the process of updating the Determination of Missing Data section of the confirmation based on comments from Tim.  I will be out of the office until late afternoon but should be able to have the draft done today for final comments.  We should be able to have a product available to send out on Monday (taking into consideration that credit provisions would be counterparty specific, and would still need to be added to the confirmations if we want to show our counterparties something more than a sample draft.)
 
Please let me know if you have any questions.
Brent
