Please see the attached list which details items pending for legal review and comments. The list details the issue by counterparty and the number of unsigned transactions as a result of the issue.  Can you provide me with an update as to where we stand on each item or if there is additional information needed from the confirmation team?  I would like to know which attorney has each particular Counterparty issue.  Thanks for your assistance.
