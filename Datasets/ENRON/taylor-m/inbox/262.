Steve - in order to draft the contribution agreement for RMT to transfer
the ETP partnership interests to swapco, we will need to review the
partnership agreements (1) for required consents, etc. and (2) to schedule
the interests in the agreement.  Do you have copies of the appropriate
partnership agreements and, if not, do you know from whom we could get
them?  Thanks.
