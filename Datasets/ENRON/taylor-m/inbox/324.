Mark:

I am forwarding this to you because Tana's return e-mail message stated that she would not be back to work until 29 Nov.

Any help you can give me will be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.

Tana:

Your entities are classified as being potentially subject to FERC reporting requirements.  Jim Derrick and Greg Whalley were to come off the slates 1 Nov.  I need to paper the Glisan/Bowen swap,  as well as the replacements for Messrs. Derrick and Whalley.

Please let me know who will replace Messrs. Derrick and Whalley, so I can paper all of the above for the entities listed below.

Clickpaper.com, L.L.C.
CommodityLogic LLC
DealBench L.L.C.
Enron Net Works LLC
EnronOnline, LLC
	Directors:  JDerrick, MHaedicke, GWhalley

Thanks.
