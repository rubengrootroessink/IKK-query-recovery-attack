Michael,

Enclosed is a Background Paper we did on NOx in late 1998.  It was a 52-page 
document, only about half of which is enclosed here because it was only sent 
out as a hard copy.  As a result, many of the tables, graphs, and diagrams 
are not shown in this version.

We are about to issue a large number of Background Papers within the next 
30-45 days.  We will most certainly have completed our new NOx and SO2 papers 
in that time frame, and are hoping to have our Mercury paper done as well.

In addition, we are issuing our Quarterly long-term forecasts on both NOx and 
SO2 in the latter half of this month.  Obviously, the next ones will be 
issued in December.

Once again, thanks for your interest.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Best Regards,

John Dean
