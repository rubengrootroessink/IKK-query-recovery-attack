Michael,

I wanted to check with you to see if you had had any more time to consider 
our Environmental Forecasting service.  I believe I had given you some names 
and numbers of some of our clients, as well as sent you some samples.

I am in New York City in meetings today and Friday, but will be back in the 
office Monday morning.  There is also a chance I will be in Houston on 
business mid-October.  If so, it might be a good chance for me to meet both 
your boss and you (and anyone else) and discuss what our service could do for 
you.  Does that sound worthwhile?

Best Regards,

John Dean
