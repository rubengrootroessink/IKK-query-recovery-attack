Michael,

Enclosed is the unedited version of our latest monthly forecast.  As I 
mentioned to you, our long-term forecast for NOx (which includes the SIP 
Call) will be issued within a week and thereafter, the SIP Call forecast will 
be included in our Monthly publication as well.  Likewise, our long-term SO2 
forecast will be published within 2 weeks.

Perhaps some of the best recommendations for our service come from our own 
clients.  Here are a few to start with:  Gary Hart (Director of Emissions for 
Southern Company and President of the Emissions Marketing Assoc. [205] 
257-7438); Mark Newlin (Cinergy [317] 838-1355); and Ed Blunk (Kansas City 
Power & Light [816] 556-2324).

I look forward to talking with you soon,

John Dean
