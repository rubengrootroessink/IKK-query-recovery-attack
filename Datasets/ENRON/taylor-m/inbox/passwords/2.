Michael,

I've extended your access dthrough the end of the week.

We've taken pricing feedback from the marketplace and lowered the price so
that now the annual subscription price is $4,800 and subscribers have the
option to pay with SO2 allowances (23 at current prices).

Also, we are working on gathering information on planned scrubber
installations and some other enhancements.

Neil

Neil,

Thank you for showing me your product last month.  I wanted to make a
list of things your program offers.  I failed to do this b/c something
came up the week I had the free trial.  I consider your product a good
product which may interest us in the future if updates are made.  Can I
get my password temporarily activated for a day or two?  Another group
contacted us to give us a demonstration.  I wanted to remember what you
guys had so I had a good comparison.

Thanks
Michael
