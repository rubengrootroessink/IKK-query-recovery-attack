Not being aware of all the ins and outs of your transaction, but based upon=
 the description below and the provisions of the master netting agreement, =
I think the receivables must be removed from step 1 (see Sections 7/11 or t=
he netting agreement); therefore, an amendment is evidently required.

=09Mary, in step 1 all of the receivables meeting the definition of Receiva=
ble are transferred from ENA to Swee'P; in step 2 Swee'P sells an undivided=
 interest in the pool of Receivables to ASCC [CIBC's conduit vehicle]. The =
September report indicated that PG&E accounted for 3,340,000/167,000,000 th=
's of ASCC's interest in the pool of receivables [ASCC having an interest o=
f 167,000,000 divided by some larger amount [which amount includes the exce=
ss concentration amount, a reserve requirement, etc.]] Swee'P obtained from=
 ENA.  Note that if the PG&E receivable is "removed" from step 2, then all =
that really happens is that no credit is given to Swee'P in the numerator, =
resulting in a smaller undivided interest in the pool being transferred to =
ASCC; however, by virtue of the PG&E receivable being transferred from ENA =
to Swee'P in step 1, the PG&E receivable will always be in the denominator,=
 and ASCC will always buy an undivided interest in the pool which includes =
the PG&E receivable, it will just buy a smaller percentage interest if it i=
s excluded from the numerator. I need to know what you mean by "extracting"=
 the receivable -- if you mean that no credit is obtained by Swee'P in the =
calculation of the undivided interest that ASCC purchases, then that can be=
 accomplished on the next reinvestment date. If you mean that no undivided =
interest in the receivable can be transferred to ASCC, then I think it need=
s to come out of step 1 [so that it is removed from the denominator, not ju=
st the numerator], and I think that the only way to do that is by amending =
the documents.=20

Per Lisa Mellencamp and based upon visiting with Mark Taylor, extracting th=
e PGE receivables on 10/25, the next regular date, is satisfactory.  Please=
 note that the master netting does not include the PGE utility entity, only=
 the non-utilities.  Joel, you have a copy of the netting agreement showing=
 all parties thereto.  You should check with Hodge re any utility gas contr=
act receivables.
