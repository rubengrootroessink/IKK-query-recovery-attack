On 9/27 Traci Warner called me and said that Enron feared that they were "getting too deep into core schools" and that they wanted to do direct recruiting at LSU (solicit resumes, screen, and do phone interviews).  They had decided that they wanted to make a presentation to finance students in BR and would probably send Mike and Linsday to meet my class, then have Mike, Lindsday, and another speaker at an SFA meeting.  This meeting would be followed by a receptionist at a local restaurant.


Traci said that she'd call me back on Friday, 9/28, and asked me to suggest a place for the reception.  She did not call me, but Corina Taylor left a message at 5:30 p.m.  


I called Corina on Monday 10/1.  She said that she was assigned to get a speaker to SFA and that she was not certain about a reception.  She said that Enron reps would accept resumes at the meeting.  She called me again today and said that they could have a speaker at LSU for Thursday, October 18.  She asked me to send her a building and room number.


I'm going to get back to her and ask for clarification on whether they want to plan for a small reception.


I will keep you informed.
