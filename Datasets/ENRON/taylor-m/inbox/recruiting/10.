Mike,
   This is Nick Monteleone, old baseball buddy.  I spoke with you when yall came to LSU for the information session and reception at Mike Anderson's.  Hopefully you remember my situation, so I won't get into all those details.  I thought I would send you a copy of my resume.  Maybe you could get it to a recuiter or someone with the decision making power.  That's all.  I just need an upper hand instead of using all this database resume submission.  Don't go through a lot of trouble at all, just maybe hand it to someone that makes the decisions.  And if you can't that is fine too.  I just wanted to give it a shot.  Thank you for the assistance Mike.  Drop me an email from time to time and let me know how things are going.  Bye Mike.
    Sincerely,
           NICK MONTELEONE
