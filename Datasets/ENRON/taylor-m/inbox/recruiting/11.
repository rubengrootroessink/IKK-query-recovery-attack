I agree concerning the timing of the process.  Please send the receipts to me and have the XMS report sent to me as well.

Jeff,

I just submitted my expense report from the LSU recruiting trip.  I was told to put your name as the approver.  

I am inter-officing the receipts to you.  Please let me know if you need anything else.  I would like the process to go as quickly as possible.

Thanks,
Mike
