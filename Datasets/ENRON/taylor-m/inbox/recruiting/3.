I would like to take the time to voice my opinion concerning the current status of recruiting at LSU.  I have tried several times to volunteer to help in the recruiting effort, and after trying Valarie Barnes and Traci Warner, Valarie informed me today that the team will not be travelling to LSU this week and indeed "after careful review, the LSU recruiting effort has been changed from a broad based effort to a Direct Strategy."  I know what that means, and frankly I'm quite upset with that decision.  

First of all, I don't understand how you go from hiring perhaps your largest contingent from LSU ever, and one semester later decide that a broad recruiting effort is no longer worthy.  I realize the desire to broaden the recruiting effort to include new schools where an Enron presence is a good fit; and I also understand the need to downsize efforts that are no longer feasible.  It just doesn't make sense that LSU falls into the latter category.  The fact is that we are a motivated, hard-working, diverse, and well-rounded group.  We have both the intellectual and the social skills to excel here at Enron, and I think the recruiting team, by making this decision, is missing an opportunity.  

There are many LSU graduates that hold high positions in this company, and certainly we comprise a large percentage of the Analyst & Associate Program.  By not recruiting in the same manner that you have, you are missing out on the many talents that future LSU business graduates could offer to Enron.  Concentrating your efforts on gathering a few resumes from certain professors or administrators does not allow you to realize our full potential.  On paper, who knows how we stack up against the rest of the field.  But, sit us down and provide us with an opportunity to express our thoughts, experiences, and skills, and I am very confident that you will find in LSU students the Respect, Integrity, COMMUNICATION, and Excellence that defines our company.  This is the manner in which we excel, and indeed that is why I think that I am here.

I realize that I am only one voice, and I have only been here for two months.  But, I take great pride in my school and the fact that Enron took such an interest in LSU and in me. It was my hope that after accepting an offer here, and working for such a great company, that I would be able to pass on how fulfilling this Enron experience is to others at LSU.  With this in mind, it is upsetting to think that I might be the last of the LSU graduates to be recruited in such a manner that was so exciting, so stressful, such a test...and ultimately so rewarding.

Billy, I thank you for your time, and I would certainly welcome the opportunity to speak with you more.

Sincerely,

Kevin Murray
Analyst
