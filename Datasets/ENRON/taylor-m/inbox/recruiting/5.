Michael,
I am a graduating senior (December) who is interested in interviewing with
Enron this fall.  I need to find out what I need to do as far as the
interview process goes, since I understand Enron won't be interviewing on
campus this semester.

I am going to be visiting Houston this weekend, and have gotten in touch
with Lindsay Culotta about stopping by the office early Friday morning.
Dr. Crary told me I should also contact you before I go over there.

Thanks for your help,
Ben Exner
