These are the compliance supplement numbers for the NOx SIP Call not the OTR compliance supplement numbers which are roughly 25,000 tons.

On the state file.  The CSP of each state added together is way above 25,000.  Why is this?  How should I look at this CSP?  Is there a discount factor that will be applied to get down to the 25,000 at the end of 2002.  If so, what is it?

Should I add them all together and get a percent per state?  And then multiply the percent by 25,000 to determine the state's CSP at the end of 2002?  Please advise.

Michael - I haven't heard back from Joel yet on a call date & time, but here is some of the info I promised.  Attached is the latest information I have on the state allocations, including their total trading budgets:

 << File: State.htm >> 


Also attached, is the Section 126 Non-EGU allocations:

 << File: Sec. 126 NonEGU affected units.pdf >> 

I am pretty sure this is all the non-EGUs that will affected in those states under the SIP Call, but am double checking just to be completely sure.

I am still working on a date that the allowances have to be parked in the compliance supplement pool in 2002 to be valid in 2003.  

I'll let you know as soon as I have some more answers.
