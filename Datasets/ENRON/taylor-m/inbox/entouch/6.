Increased liquidity in the prompt months has brought more players into the spot rail market. Traditionally a thin market in the OTC market, the coal group is capitalizing on increased interest by introducing several new EOL rail products. On the CSX rail line, there will be two 12,500 btu products with different sulfur contents - 1.2 pound (or compliance) and 1.6 pound. The CSX contract will be FOB rail in the Big Sandy or Kanawha rail districts. On the Norfolk Southern rail line there will be two similiar 12,500 btu products, however, FOB rail in the Thacker or Kenova rail districts. The coal group intends to bring these products on line within a week for the cash book, and hopefully extend them to the forward markets.
