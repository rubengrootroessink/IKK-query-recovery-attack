Wayne,

Corp. PR and IR were ok with the general content/wording of the Anker press release.  However, IR prefers not to have direct quotes from Enron in a press release issued by a third party, so given the short time frame we are operating in to receive release approval, we took out George McClellan's quote.  Attached please find a copy of the final document for you to share with Anker.  I also now forwarded it to Mike McConnell.  In the event I will receive any negative feedback from Mike over the weekend, I will leave you a message on your cellular phone (or if you prefer, at your office voice mail).  Over the weekend, please feel free to call me at home (713-572-8288) or on my cell phone (713-298-6523) with any further questions.  Again, thank you for your cooperation.
