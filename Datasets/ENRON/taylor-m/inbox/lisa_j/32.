COP-7 --- Update on Progress

The mood at the climate change negotiations has picked up considerably since my last email. A compromise has been reached on the Kyoto Protocol compliance regime, which has given delegates hope that Ministers can forge agreement on remaining contentious issues by the end of the week.

Under the compliance deal, the Kyoto Protocol will retain its legal status, but decisions on binding consequences will be adopted post-ratification. 

The rules for the market-based mechanisms and national reporting still have significant unresolved issues, which are being negotiated as I write this report. 

In the meantime, Ministers arrived last night and have been making their opening statements all day. This will continue for some time.

U.S. Under Secretary for Global Affairs Paula Dobriansky arrived yesterday evening, but has not yet briefed the U.S. business community. She has scheduled a briefing for tomorrow evening. Traditionally, the U.S. delegation meets with business observers almost every night - the delegation has not met with U.S. business community since last Friday. Many are frustrated by this.

Please let me know if you have any questions. Otherwise, I report more tomorrow.

--- On a separate note, my thoughts are with every one during this trying time for Enron - there is not much more I can say, but I am reading all the clips and, like you, trying to stay focused and hoping for the best.

Again, if you would like to contact me please try via email or call me at +41793453046.

All the best,

Lisa
