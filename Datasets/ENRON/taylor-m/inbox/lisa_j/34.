There are two ways in which Enron Wind can generate credits: (1) Through "g=
overnment/regulatory body/ISO" issuing one REC for each MWh of electricity =
generated.  The REC represents all of the environmental attributes associat=
ed with the generation, including but not limited to CO2, NOX, SO2, PM, VOC=
s, location of generation of fuel/resource type.  The current programs for =
regulatory bodies or ISOs issuing RECs are: ERCOT (current); NePool (April =
'02); PJM (March '02 -- with the caveat that details have yet to be worked =
out in PJM); (2) Through voluntary bilateral contracts where Enron Wind sel=
ls of the attributes of the wind power.  They can choose to sell this separ=
ately or bundled with the Wind.  Finally, certification bodies such as Gree=
n-e, which offers voluntary certification for green products, intends to st=
art a national registry for green tags next year.  In addition, the Automat=
ed Power Exchange has an exchange in CA and the Midwest. They also built th=
e system for ERCOT and are administering the system for NePool.  BPA also h=
as a green tag program.

I'm glad to discuss further with you tomorrow.  I'm at home ill today -- bu=
t wanted to give you a jumpstart.

Stacey,

Good morning.

I spoke to Michael about this generally this am -- but suggested that he wo=
rk with you on how Enron Wind, and others, generate credits under RECs, and=
 emissions programs -- I talked a bit about CO2.

He is looking for some help with developing a paragraph or so on how wind w=
ould generate allowances/credits for his business plan.=20

Please give him a ring today if possible.  His timeline is the next few day=
s.  Let me know if Ic an be of assistance.

Thanks,

Lisa

Lisa,=20

In a paragraph or two (Brief Summary):

Please explain how Enron Wind generates credits (or allowances).  Energy Re=
newable Certificates.

I am not sure if this is more Stacey's expertise.  I am using you as our po=
int of contact. =20

Thanks
