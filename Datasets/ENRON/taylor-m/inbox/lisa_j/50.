ICTK Announces Strategic Alliance for Coal Industry

TULSA, Okla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 17, 2001--International Cavitation Technologies, Inc. (OTCBB:ICTK - news)
today announced the formation of a strategic alliance with Meridian Ionic, Ltd. (``MIL''), a division of Meridian Hydrocarbons,
Inc., to jointly develop and market their proprietary ``Ion Collider'' technology to the coal industry. 

In previous laboratory testing, ICTK's patented Ion Collider(TM) ``ionized'' coal water wash resulted in a significant reduction
in the amount of ash and sulfur content in the coal. These reductions directly result in a cleaner-burning coal with a higher BTU
capacity. Mr. Gerald M. Brother, president of MIL, added: ``There is a tremendous demand for new 'clean' coal-burning
technology. With more than one billion tons of coal being burned annually by U.S. utility and manufacturing facilities alone, which
results in some 115 million tons of ash/waste, there is literally an unlimited market for cleaner-burning coal. The Ion
Collider(TM) proprietary process of washing the coal with ionized water can significantly increase the value of the coal.'' 

Under the terms of the strategic alliance, MIL and ICT will work in conjunction to market the Ion Collider technology, initially to
the steel and cement industries, and eventually to the utility corporate coal end-users. ``Enhancing and improving coal-burning
efficiencies will be a major economic and environmental asset to the continuing use of coal as a long-term, abundant and
acceptable fuel,'' stated Monroe A. Ashworth III, president of ICTK. ``Based on the remarkable results we have seen from our
research testing, we anticipate a rapid development of the Ion Collider's application in the coal industry,'' concluded Ashworth. 

International Cavitation Technologies Inc. owns six different patents and the worldwide rights to proprietary technology with a
vast array of applications, including enhanced oil and gas production, dredging, environmental remediation, separation, waste
minimization, wastewater treatment, air-conditioning and a variety of oil field applications. ICTK currently has licensing
agreements in place with several companies. Ion Collider(TM) technology has proven its ability to remove contaminants from a
variety of matrices in significantly less time and at lower costs than traditional environmental technologies. Additional information
concerning ICTK can be found on the Internet at www.ioncollider.com.
