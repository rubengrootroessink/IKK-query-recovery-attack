Trevor and Mike,
 
FYI only.
 
Given all the uncertainty now, it is probably best to discuss this in a week or so, pending your interest.
 
Thanks,
 
Lisa
 
Trevor - I will give you a ring later today.

Subject: DOE Solicitation - Carbon Sequestration



Dear Enron Team:

The Office of Fossil Energy, through the National Energy Technology
Laboratory (NETL)is offering multi-year and multi-million Carbon
Sequestration awards.  The one-day seminar that L&A set up last Thursday was
undertaken in a very timely manner.  NETL is trolling the waters in search
of new development and deployment opportunities.  Their game is one for
insiders.  That means that you have to get in a pre-application (5 doubled
spaced pages - 2 real pages of text) by December 6th to keep your place in
line.  The submission need be only good enough to keep their interest to ask
us to submit more information - and thanks to last Thursday you now know
what they are looking for.  All those that miss the deadline are out for the
entire year.  Accordingly, we need to jump through this hoop to stay in line
and then leverage our relationship with NETL to try to secure a grant.

NETL is making $17 million available for cost-shared applications for
research and development of fossil energy technologies.  The Government
anticipates the project period for the subject awards to be twelve to
thirty-six months.

This Master Solicitation is divided into Areas of Interest.  The attached
Master Template covers only Area of Interest 4, Carbon Sequestration,
DE-PS26-02NT41422-4.  The full solicitation is also attached for your
review.

A 5 page pre-application must be submitted by December 6 in order to be
considered for Round One funding.  All submission requirements are included
in the attached Master Template.

Best regards,

Murray
