Good morning everyone.  Alice LeBlanc of the Chicago Climate Exchange is still in town, as she lives in NYC and cannot get home, and will be coming by at 2:00 pm today to talk about the exchange if folks feel up to it and are free.  I will plant to talk with her regardless and hope that some of you can join us.  But we will try to re-schedule for early October if today does not work.

DETAILS:

TODAY - 9/12
2:00 pm
3AC 15 CI

Thanks.

Stacey,

Now that you are back in town, it would be very helpful to have you (and Elliot) attend this meeting if you are free. CCX is a voluntary GHG emissions trading program -- with several big company participants.  They are in the design phase now -- deciding what will qualify as a reduction, what the scope will be (mid-west initially with expansion to national) and what vol. obligations company participants will have.

TODAY - 9/11
2:30 pm
3AC15C1

I can provide more background to you if you would like - I will be up on 47 after about 10:30 am today.

Thanks,

Lisa

Hello!

Would you be free to meet briefly in Houston with reps. of the Chicago Climate Exchange on Tuesday, Sept. 11 (pm). I have met with them a few times -- key issues regarding Enron's participation are 1) lack of a voluntary target and 2) the CCX's initial mid-west focus.

However, more companies are joining and it would be interesting to see how their design phase is evolving and how they are handling the sticking issues related to the targets, among other issues.

Also, please let me know if you have others who you think might find it of value (since the vol. targets issues is not resolved, I am hesitant to invite more commercial people, as I would not want to have the CCX folks pitch them on something that we would most likely not join at this stage -- thoughts?)


Thanks,

Lisa
