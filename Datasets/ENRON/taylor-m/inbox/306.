Peter, per our conversation, I have attached the proposed mini- dash which describes the licensing agreement that Enron will be entering into with AEP in connection with  Enron- owned software applications relating to the operation of the Houston Pipe Line System....As we concluded, this transaction would not be prohibited by the Dynergy Purchase and Sale Agreement. I will forward you a copy of the final Dash for Enron's internal records

Best Regards
Barbara
