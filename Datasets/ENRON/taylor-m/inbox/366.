Mike,

So is the coal group a core group?

As regards job offers, I have not tried as yet. If you recall, I accepted the Enron offer before October 1. And that meant I could not participate in the campus placement process. And the process that started in the first week of October is almost over. My only option it to wait and see and probably take some action in the next semester.

Let's see how things play out!
