Hi Mark,

We are in the process of gathering forms for Jane McBride (Japan office) and Alan asked me to check with you on whether there are any terms sheet forms for use in respect of item 2 below.  If such forms are available, would it be possible to obtain soft copies?

Thanks.
Nony

Dear Alan,

This is the feedback I got from the guys re types of deals they are thinking about now.  

1 - Product: Crude and Products, LPG, LNG, Naphtha, Power
2 - Transaction: Buy/Sell of Swap, Cap, Floor, No-cost Collar 
3 - Structuring - for various products - purchase, prepayment and tolling 

Also, wonder if there are any inventory finance term sheets / contracts (for taking inventory off balance sheet).

Whatever you can lay your hands on easily will be fine - as they do more relationship building with counterparts in Houston, I guess they will also be able to ask the people there directly as well.  We hope to be getting more people out of Houston here ourselves too.

Thanks Alan,

Jane
