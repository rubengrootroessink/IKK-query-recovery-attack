I attach a copy of the LME's official statement. Let me know if you wish to discuss.

Jonathan - Grateful if you would send Mark the LME's official statement, as requested.  Thanks.

Mark - FYI, the sanctions relate to legacy MG issues (as you'd expect!).

Regards

paul

Have we been officially sanctioned by the LME?  If so, please send me a copy of any official statements of sanction. Depending on exactly what they say, we may have to report the situation to other exchanges here and possibly the CFTC.

Thanks!
