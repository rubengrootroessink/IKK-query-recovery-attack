Mark,

I spoke to the postmaster and she stated that the
mailbox needs to be placed either to the side of the
gate or outside of the gate.  She said that the main
office does not like the fact that the postmasters
have a key to a residence.  I don't know whether you
have had the opportunity to speak with them yet.  If
so, please disregard.

Secondly, were you planning on having an electrician
come do any work on your house?  If so, I would like
to see if he/she can put a light in the bathroom as
well as electrical outlets.

I'll be awaiting your response.  Thanks!

Veronica
