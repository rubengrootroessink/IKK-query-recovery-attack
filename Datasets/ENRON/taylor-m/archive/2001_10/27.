Mark, I am sure you are overwhelmed on other projects, but I wanted to make
sure that you had received the attached.  I have some comments / questions
on the form of Electronic Trading Agreement you sent me.  No rush, just call
me at your convenience.

I hope you are well.  Nobel started this week -- a great excuse to go out
for a nice lunch!

Regards,  David
