 Attached is the form of Contract Matrix which Travis prepared.  Please complete as we have discussed--- based upon the typical forms that you are using.  Please also attach the forms of contract so that we have them handy to refer to the exact language.  We would very much appreciate if we could get these completed forms no later than Monday morning.  If you can complete sooner, even better.  Thank you .   Julia
