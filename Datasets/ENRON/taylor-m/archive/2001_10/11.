The recent revisions to the UCC Article 9 relate to the ability of counterp=
arties to engage in receivable financings which could have the effect of de=
feating the master netting concepts because it makes the restrictions on su=
ch actions included in the master netting agreement ineffective.  Prior law=
 made prohibitions, but not restrictions, ineffective. I am in the process =
of adding some language to the form on which we are working to manage this =
issue (however, we will leave the restrictions in place as well for possibl=
e waiver arguments or further changes in future law).  In essence each of t=
he parties will take and perfect a security interest in its own potential o=
bligations to each of the other parties.  This will require UCC searches of=
 our counterparties at the outset of negotiations to be sure we will hold a=
 first lien.  It will require a downdate and filing as we consummate the ne=
tting agreement.  To the extent you are in current negotiations, you may wi=
sh to conduct the appropriate lien searches.  Rick Antonoff should coordina=
te the searches and filings for us.  If you have any questions, please advi=
se.


Rick Antonoff, by copy of this memo, please prepare filings for the PGE mas=
ter netting and the NewPower master netting to support the grants of securi=
ty interests to us in the amounts we owe them.  Each of these agreements in=
cludes this language in the security interest grants (6(b)). =20
1.  The New Power Company is incorporated in Delaware.  Provide me the form=
 of proposed statement for review prior to filing.  We should make this fil=
ing as soon as possible.  A copy of the final version is attached.
2.  As to PGE, I will verify with Lisa Mellencamp that it is ok to file on =
the master netting agreement and the entities involved since they were not =
in the bankruptcy (to my knowledge).  Once verified, I will let you know.  =
The PGE parties are:  PG&E Energy Trading-Gas Corporation, PG&E Energy Trad=
ing, Canada Corporation, PG&E Energy Trading-Power, L.P., and CEG Energy, O=
ptions Inc.  I do not have these entities states of incorporation.  Lisa at=
 853-7986 can get that information for you.  I do not have the final versio=
n of this netting on line; if you need it, let me know.
