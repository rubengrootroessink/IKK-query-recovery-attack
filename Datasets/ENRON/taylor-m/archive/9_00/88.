Dear Justin,

As promised, you will find attached our views on the basic questions you 
posed about Part 30 issues in your e-mail of 12 September. As I say in the 
attached paper we will provide a follow-up paper on the more complex issues 
in your 14 September e-mail and related questions.

I am also e-mailing copies to Mark Taylor and Ken Raisler.

Tomorrow, I will send you hard copies with the Appendices I refer to in the 
text of the attached.

Please give me a call when you have had a chance to look this over 
(7825-4561).

All the best,

Ned
