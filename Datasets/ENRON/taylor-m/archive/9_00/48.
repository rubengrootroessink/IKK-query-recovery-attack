Gentlemen-

 Attached pleased find the revised Subscriber Agreement, with some fine 
adjustments in the language as we discussed last Friday.

 One amendment that we discussed was the removal of some of the language 
related to EBS equipment.  We have done this (note no mention of janitorial 
services), but have elected to leave the discussion of liens and insurance in 
the document, in the event that our third parties need to install any 
equipment in order to deliver the T-1 service.  If any counterparty has a 
specific objection to this language, we can discuss further modifications.  
Leaving the language intact, however, will lessen further delays should the 
third-party local loop providers require some assurances about their 
connection equipment.

 Please contact me if you would like to discuss, or reply to this message 
with your approval of the document.  Once we confirm your acceptance of the 
document, we will forward to the counterparties.

David Mims
