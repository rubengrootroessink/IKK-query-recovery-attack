CORPORATES CONSIDER HEDGING AS OIL PRICES LEAP 
Asian corporates, including Eva Airlines, Fletcher Challenge Energy and 
Bharat Pertroleum Corp. are reconsidering their hedging strategies as oil 
prices hit a new 10-year high last week. Oil producers are looking to lock in 
high 
rates, while oil consumers are considering adjusting the amount of the 
exposure 
they hedge. 

EURO/DOLLAR VOL RISES IN ANTICIPATION OF DANISH VOTE 
Traders are piling into short-date options expiring on Sept. 29, the date 
when the 
results of the Danish referendum to enter the euro-zone will be announced. 
However 
the referendum ends up, the markets are likely to react wildly. 

FIRST CHICAGO EQUITY DERIVATIVES TRADER STEPS DOWN; 
MARKET WONDERS

stepped down, 
and the bank has been seen unwinding positions in the market. Rival traders 
claim that 
the firm is pulling out of equity derivatives. An official at FCTM said it is 
not pulling out and 
declined to comment further.
