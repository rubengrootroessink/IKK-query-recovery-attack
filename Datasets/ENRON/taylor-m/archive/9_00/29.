MG Ltd. is entering into FX transactions through ENA.  The companies have 
also entered into financial copper trades (first trade 6/16/00).  I think RMT 
and MG Ltd. should enter into an ISDA Master but I don't know the long term 
plan for MG Ltd.   Please confirm.  Sara

P.S.  Have we assigned a single paralegal to handle RMT Masters?
