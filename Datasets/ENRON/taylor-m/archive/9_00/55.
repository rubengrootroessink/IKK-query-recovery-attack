Mark,

This is just a follow up on the guaranty from Consolidated Edison, Inc. which 
I had left with you a week or so ago.  As per the confirm below, the 
counterparty will need to issue a guaranty by Friday, Sept 22.  They are in 
need of our comments of the format so that they can review and process the 
request.  Please get back to me with you comments.  To the extent you need 
another copy of the gty format, just let me know.

Rgds,
Ed Sacks
