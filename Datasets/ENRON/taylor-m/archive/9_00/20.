Amanda has a break from Nov 3-8th  ( and I don't think she has classes on 
Friday anyway).  Is that something the three of us can work with?  
Alternatively, do you think the two of us could manage over Thanksgiving - 
with amanda joining for the long weekend (fly down Thurs eve and back Mon).  
I can't remember what day of the week charters begin and end. - is it set in 
stone?   Plan B - we could met at the Greenbriar or DC for Thanksgiving.  I 
understand from Amanda that Bill is not going anywhere until 2001.  Of course 
that does make New Year's eve a possibility.  If all else fails, I did hear 
from Greg this week and he wants to know if we are still sailing.   And I am 
still looking for something to do over Christmas.

I sent Amanda & Bill an e-mail a couple of weeks ago and here is Bill's reply.
I sent him a fairly detailed note on how we usually schedule things and which
were the best times of year, etc.  I haven't heard anything from Amanda and 
was
beginning to assume they were not really interested in a November trip.  Have
you heard anything firm from Virginia?  Bill's next-to-last paragraph tells me
that he's getting to know Amanda - but I don't think she'll leave him alone 
for
the holiday.  The real question is whether her uncanny ability will extend to
his schedule, too.  If they still want to go we'd better make travel plans 
soon
- that Thanksgiving Sunday is notoriously difficult to get seats.  If you'd
rather wait until Jan. or Feb. that's fine with me too.  Just let me know.

Hey Mark, nice to hear from you.  I am glad you enjoyed the wedding.  It went
by so fast for me but it seems that people had a good time.  Apart from a few
travel related glitches the honeymoon was also spectacular.  Tahiti is a true
paradise.

I am committed to the concept of sailing in the Carribean but my problem is
that my honeymoon has put me firmly in "vacation deficit" at the SEC.
Barring any emergency congressional action I will not have enough days
available by Tgiving to truly enjoy sailing in the Carribean.  Amanda has
told me how much fun it is and I want to do it but I may need to find another
time.  I'll check into it and let you guys know definitively very soon.  How
long to you go for?

Keep in mind though that I do not speak for Amanda.  She has an uncanny
ability to arrange her schedule so that she can participate in virtually
every vacation idea that people bring up.

I'll be in touch,  Bill.
