I received this from Craig Young yesterday of the MG New York office who 
visited us Sep. 13-15.

If you review the Word document below, he wants me to gather much information 
which
we've been selective in providing to any internal or external party. As you 
know, some of this information is being
provided to Sarah Wesner under the direction of John Arnold and John Lavorato.

Given the current tentative status of MG clearing trades, I am not 
comfortable in providing this data at this time to MG.

However, if you think that we should be of assistance for their own analysis 
to clear/ not to clear trades, please let me know.

Thanks,

David 3-3528
