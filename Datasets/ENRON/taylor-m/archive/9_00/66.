Laura:

I'm just a lawyer and as such still operating pretty much in the stone age.  
The easiest way for me to look at something that is primarily text (minimal 
graphics involved) is to have it in a form I can just print out.  If it 
exists as a Word document that would be great.  I have not yet actually been 
able to see the phase 2 site.

Thanks,

Mark

Mark:

I am the writer that is developing the online help guide for the EnronOnIine 
system.  I work for Dave Forster.  Dave wanted to make sure that you have an 
opportunity to review the online help guide before we go live.  My 
understanding is that you have access to the test web.  The work in progress 
help guide is on the website but is by no means a finished product; it 
changes as screens and labels change.  Are you currently reviewing the online 
help or do I need to advise you when it is considered final?  Please let me 
know if you have a preferred way of reviewing this sort of thing. Thanks,

Laura J
