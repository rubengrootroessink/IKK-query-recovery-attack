Bankruptcy reform update:

 It now looks like bankruptcy reform legislation is dead for this term.  On=

Friday the President said he would veto a new Republican bill that would ha=

President's spokesman said that "too many of the bill's provisions . . . wi=

Bankruptcy alternative:

 Maybe eBay will become an alternative to filing chapter 11 in Delaware. =

Example: eSeated.com consumed $5 million in initial funding developing a=20
system for making restaurant reservations online.  Unable to complete anoth=

 In late December the appeals court held that the FCC has exclusive=20
jurisdiction to regulate the wireless licenses owned by NextWave Telecom=20
Inc.  Relying on the decision, the FCC canceled NextWave's licenses, and=20
NextWave immediately turned to the bankruptcy court for help.  The bankrupt=

court quickly ruled that the FCC's action was "self-help repossession by=20
ambush" and set aside the agency's license terminations.  In May, the FCC w=
on=20
its appeal in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, which upheld the FCC's=
