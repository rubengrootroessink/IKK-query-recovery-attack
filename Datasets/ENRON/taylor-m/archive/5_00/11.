Thanks you for your time yesterday.  It helped us quite as we are in the 
process of shaping the business opportunity.

Can you please send me some info (a memo or whatever you might have) that 
gives a high level understanding of the regulatory environment in the US for 
credit derivatives.  In particular, I would like to capture any issues that 
would affect the economics of the business opportunity.  

Can you also please give me the name of an attorney that could provide me 
with information on regulatory requirements for insurance-related businesses.

Thanks.

Gillian Johnson
