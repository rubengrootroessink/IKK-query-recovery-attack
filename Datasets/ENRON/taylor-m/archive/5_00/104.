I agree that the current Word document approval form will not be very 
practical once we scale up. Going forward, we could be looking at some kind 
of database solution as implemented for EnronOnline.

Subject: Re: Credit Trading - Approval Form  

Although this makes a lot of sense, how are going to implement it?  We plan 
to scale massively and I cannot imagine that this will be efficient enough to 
facilitate the time frames and number of reference credits that we are 
anticipating.  I think that we need to have a general policy that we can look 
to instead of approving them on a one off basis.

Let's discuss

Subject: Credit Trading - Approval Form

Attached is an Approval Form that will have to be completed to request if we 
want to trade with a new counterparty or on a new reference credit. I have 
incorporated comments from Origination, Credit and Legal. But should you have 
any further comments please let me know ASAP, as I plan to introduce this 
form by the middle of next week. (Note that there will be two forms, one for 
bankruptcy swaps and one for other credit derivatives.)

Regards

Tomas
