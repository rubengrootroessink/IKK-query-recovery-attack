Alan further to our discussion last week. Attached is request for further 
advice from Baker and McKenzie on trading weather products with Japanese 
counterparties through EOL. As discussed would you forward it to B & M. The 
date of the previous advice which indicated there are no regulatory issues 
with weather trading needs to be inserted in 2 places. (Would you be able to 
send me a copy of this advice.) 

We need to have all legal issues resolved prior to 23 June.   This is the 
scheduled date for function the public function to launch of EOL weather 
trading in Australia .  We plan to trade Tokyo and Osaka   in addition to 
Australian cities. There was discussion of  Seoul weather products but this 
has not progressed. If it does then will need to do the required due 
diligence for Korea.
