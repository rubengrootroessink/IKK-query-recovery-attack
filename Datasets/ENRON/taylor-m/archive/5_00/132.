Mark,

I am wondering if it is necessary to include a few more words in our index 
descriptors.

When we refer to a published index, should we add: "including published 
corrections", or is this obvious enough? 

I'm thinking that if there is an error in the index which is acknowledged as 
such in the publication, then the error would be seen as something which 
should be corrected if we ever went to court. I'm also thinking that we would 
not want to apply this kind of language on a go-forward basis, as to have two 
different treatments might prejudice our position (although the UK office 
wishes to add this language on a go-forward)

Thoughts?

Dave
