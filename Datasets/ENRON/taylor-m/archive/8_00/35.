When the Master does not have the weather modification to the Trade Option 
Exemption representation then I think we should include it in the confirm. Is 
this feasible?

Tanya forwarded the attached confirm on to me.  Are we supposed to have that 
weather rep also in confirmations when we trade under a master?
