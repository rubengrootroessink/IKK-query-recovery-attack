Sorry for the delay in catching up with my e-mails. Yes, MG London Inc is the 
clearing member of NYMEX/COMEX and is FCM & CTA. The only other MG companies 
who have any exchange/regulatory registrations are in the UK and are 
Metallgesellschaft Ltd (LME & SFA, also LIFFE to come), MG Brokers Ltd (LME & 
SFA), MG Metal & Commodity Co Ltd (LME only).

Rgds

Jon,

Grateful if you could complete the picture for me and for Mark Taylor.    Is 
MG London Inc. the entity that is the Clearing Member of NYMEX + a Futures 
Commission Merchant and Commodity Trading Advisor?   Do any other (MG) 
entities have similar registrations, and if so, what are these?

Thanks

Justin

Justin:

Do you know whether we have acquired any companies with CFTC registrations of 
any kind (e.g. Commodity Trading Advisor or Futures Commission Merchant)?  I 
was wondering who was responsible for compliance matters if we have.

I hope you're well and all my best to Fran.

Mark
