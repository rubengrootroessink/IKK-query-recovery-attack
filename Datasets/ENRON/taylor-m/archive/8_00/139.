No problem weather observations don't know national boundaries. In fact ENA 
has already done an OTC Australian weather trade. Clearly the GTCs will need 
to be converted into an ENA form.

Subject: Japanese & Australian Products

You both may already by aware of this, but the online team has contacted me 
and it is their desire to have the Japanese & Australian products also 
offered out of the U.S. by Enron North America.  They would continue to be 
offered by their current companies, "Enron Australia" and "EnronJapan", but 
they want the products sold "24 hours a day" and I guess to do this they 
would be offered also by Enron North America.  Do you see any legal issues 
from your side with a your Japanese or Australia products being offered by 
Enron North America too?
