Eric, 

Please find Mark Taylor's comments related to your request:

Steve Douglas-Tax person working on the MG Acquisition suggested an October 1 
date related to MG acting as a clearing broker due to the following:
-Value of the transaction would be impacted if imputed income was made 
related to acting as a clearing broker.

Jeff-

Thanks for the memo.  After meeting with Al Pennisi in NY on Friday and 
discussing your memo, I am confident that all the issues you raise can be 
addressed so that we can have MG London act as Enron's clearing broker.  I've 
asked him to contact you to review in more detail.  Please let me know the 
outcome and action plan - - - is it feasible to complete this week?
