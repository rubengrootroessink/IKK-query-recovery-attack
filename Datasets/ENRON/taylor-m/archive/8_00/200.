I have spoken to Jeff and we would like to have a meeting at 3:00 Calgary 
time (4:00 Houston time, 2:00 Portland time) tomorrow to discuss legal 
product definition and identification for the PPA, including:

1.  Firm Physical i.e. Master and GTC;

2.  Interruptible Physical

3.  Firm Financial i.e. ISDA; and

4.  Enron Online.

Structured or Origination deals will be dealt with on a case by case basis to 
manage the structural risks created by the PPAs.

Products need to be developed as soon as possible to accomodate trading the 
PPA Jan 1/00.

Please call Sharon @ 403.974.6726 to confirm, and she will set up a dial in 
number.

Regards, Peter.
