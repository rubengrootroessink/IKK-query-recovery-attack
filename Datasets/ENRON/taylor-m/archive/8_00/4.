Travis,

My thoughts are.......:

The Terms and Conditions for Use

I would add  the following text at the end of section 4:

Limited is authorized to carry on investment business in the United Kingdom 
by the UK Securities and Futures Authority (SFA) and had reviewed and 
approved the contents of this website for relevant regulatory purposes. The

Enron will not enter into transactions with persons who would be regarded as

that, pursuant to the Belgian law of 14 July 1991 on Commercial Practices, 
this website is to be considered as being advertising (reclame/publicit,). 


The Letter

The following text should be added as a footer:
