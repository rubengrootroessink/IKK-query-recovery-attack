I think 5% is way too small. At certin physical locations for both gas and 
power, a 5% move is easily achievable in the normal course of business i.e. 
35 mwh power to 45mwh or Transco Z6 from 5.00 to 5.50 in the next trade. I 
think something in the neighborhood of 20% to 25% is
commercially reasonable.
