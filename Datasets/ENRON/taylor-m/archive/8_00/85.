Just thought I'd let you know that I have graduated from paralegal school.  
I'm glad it is over, but I'm so glad that I did it.  I was able to put the 
puzzle pieces together and figure out why I was asked to type those 
pleadings!!!  I just learned yesterday that I graduated top in the class.  
I'm thrilled about that.  Maybe I'm smarter than Tana thought I was.  
Yippee!!!!Still miss seeing you everyday - life is all about change they 
say.  As ever, Jan
