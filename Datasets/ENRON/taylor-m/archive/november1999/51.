When I looked at this,  it looked like something that your group approves 
before it is sent out.  I told Dave that I approved of putting it on the 
internet only if it is something that you or your group already had approved 
of.  Please let me know if it is something you approve.

Stacy,

Attached is a copy of a newsletter which we currently send out to customers. 
This is written internally and is currently distributed by fax.

I assume that as we are already distrubuting this information by fax, there 
should be no concerns about publishing on EnronOnline?

Note that the only portions we would put online are:

Weather
Gas Storage
Commentary


Thanks,

Dave
