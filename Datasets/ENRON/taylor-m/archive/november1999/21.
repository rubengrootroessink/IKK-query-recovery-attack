carol and i are ready to go over the financial items on this list to see how 
we can help clean up any ones that need to be amended/call for collateral/or 
preserve our rights as appropriate. my assistant will call you to arrange a 
meeting shortly. let us know who else may need to be involved. we thought we 
would just run thru each counterparty on the list. we will make sure the 
physical side of the equation is covered with jeff or his designee too. 
peter, some of these are in canada, so you should probably tie in as we 
decide what to do. molly, can you send us all by email your latest list 
please???
