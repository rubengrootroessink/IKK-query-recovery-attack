What do you know about the apparent decision to attach GTCs when faxing out 
the confirms?  I believe it was the gas/power people who made that statement 
at our October mtg (you were out of town, as I recall).

I have not had any discussions with Mark Taylor on the point of attaching 
GTCs. I don't know why it has been determined to be appropriate to do the 
attachment. Please consult with Mark on this and let me know what you find 
out. Thanks.

You will recall that we went to a meeting last month w/ the EOL people while 
you were out of town.  That meeting revealed that a lot of work still needed 
to be done on the confirms.  Of course, there still hasn't been time to 
finish the liquids products EOL confirm templates, and I think the priority 
got less urgent, since these products will be among the last to be traded by 
EOL.  But the quesiton lingers about the need to attach GTCs to each confirm 
that's sent out to the EOL counterparty.  It seemed to us that perhaps you 
and Mark Taylor and others might have had discussions on that topic ahnd 
reached some conclusion.  Rob Cass made a rather cogent appeal that we not 
require the attachment (lots of manhours, for one reason, since the computer 
will not automatically generate the GTCs or autofax them).  But we never had 
a chance to talk about this, so I'm wondering if you could give me your 
thoughts.  Thanks.

By the way, it looks like the SK deal closing is on for next week, so I'll be 
leaving for Singapore on Monday.

Have you had a chance to review and finalize the templates for any of our EOL 
confirmations?    

Also, have any decisions been made on "GTC" attachment/no attachment?

Thanks for your help!

Lynn
