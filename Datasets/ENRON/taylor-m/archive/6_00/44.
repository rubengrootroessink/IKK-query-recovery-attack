Mark & Jason,

Karen is referring to slides 2-3 in the presentation in the paragraph in red 
below.  I don't see any issues with us having the words below at the bottom 
of each powerpoint slide.  Could you please confirm this?



Thanks in advance,
Rahil

Rahil,

Attached is the powerpoint template that we (Viant) put together.  Mike and
Dave believe this is the version that we want to go with, but we should
check with Kal since he spent time on the ppt template that he developed.

Also attached is the functional spec for the FYINet powerpoint player.

In addition, you will want to have legal review the copyright trademark at 
the bottom of the template.  There was some concern that EnronOnline is not a 
legal entity.

thanks, Karen
