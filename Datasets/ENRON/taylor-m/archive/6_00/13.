Dear Dave

Thanks for forwarding this. It does look very good.

Just a couple of comments:

1. With respect to a disclaimer on content, although Enron does have an
indemnity, it may be worth putting in place some preventative measures just
in case -  I suggest something along the lines of "The information on this
site is provided solely by Sports.com [and its licensors]. However, neither
Enron nor Sports.com take any responsibility or make any warranty about the
accuracy or completeness of such information and any reliance you place on
it is at your own risk"

2. I tried clicking on the Minutemania link and nothing happened. I just
wanted to check the registration page, if there already is one.

PLease contact me if you have any questions.

Kind regards

Marly Didizian

Here is what the proposed site would look like following the link from the
EnronOnline quotes screen.  From a commercial and design perspective it
looks
great.  Any legal issues?

Louise raised the idea that we may want to add a disclaimer that the content
is
provided by Sports.com.  I told her that we had an indemnification from them
with respect to libel, etc.   Please let me know if you think we need to add
this.

thanks
Dave

Hello Dave

Kevin Arrix is currently having problems with his  e:mail at the moment so I
am
contacting you directly with the latest revised  example of the Enron
co-branded
page. I am doing the graphic work on the page so  if there are any changes
regarding the look -  you can contact me  directly.

Cheers,

Donald Cuthbertson.
