Ed,

Have you been directed to Louise Kitchen or to any of her folks? She's been 
pretty hands on with the migration of new business lines on to Enron Enron 
Online.

Dale,

Tom and I would like to offer int. transportation on HPL on EOL.  I have 
worked out a schematic of what I think the service should look like.  Should 
I get with you or someone else to review what I am going to propose and start 
the process?  EDG
