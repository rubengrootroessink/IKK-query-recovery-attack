Mark:

As we discussed, in lieu of including the Legal and Privacy Info link on the 
top bar of the home page, we can propose the addition of a sentence at the 
bottom ot the home page text with a link to Legal and Privacy.

I propose the following:

Please see Legal and Privacy Information for terms governing your use of the 
web site.

Let me know what you think.
