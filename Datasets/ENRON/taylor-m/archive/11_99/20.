Where are we with Colombia? 

I notice that customers from Australia, Aruba, Bermuda, Colombia, Israel, 
Japan, Mexico, Trinidad and Tobago, Venezuela and South Africa have also been 
approached in the mail shot (!)

I've highlighted the countries that I would expect to be more appropriate to 
UK (than US) legal opinion (ie it's pretty much an arbitrary split). Don't 
suppose you've been asked to get docs together for the others have you?
