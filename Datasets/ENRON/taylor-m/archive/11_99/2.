Hey Mark

Good to see you again last Sunday and I hope the conference went well.

I dont want to be a pain, but I feel it only right and proper to flag an 
issue I have.

My travel authorisation has not yet come through.  They are supposed to take 
4 weeks, but it has been at least 8 so far.  The authorisation may come 
through any time now, but if it does not come through I cannot leave the US.  
It would be stupid to jeopardise my Green Card application after waiting so 
long.

Sorry about this, but if the worst comes to the worst I am sure you 3 guys 
will have a great time anyhow.

Bruce
