Mark, thanks for your advice during our phone discussion on Monday. That was 
the feedback I was looking for. I was concerned that in Australia we would be 
revisiting issues that had already been resolved elsewhere.    

We are now progressing to wrap up the legal issues in line with our scheduled 
implemenation date of April 1. I'll keep you posted of developments .
