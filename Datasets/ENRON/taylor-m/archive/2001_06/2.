Hi Alan,

We are negotiating an ISDA agreement with Toa Reinsurance Company and they have asked (amongst other things) that we agree that the third party debt figure for the purpose of Events of Default - of US$100 million - be reduced to US$10 million on the basis that 100 million is too large to be practical.  

I asked John Suttle today whether there is another figure between the two that might be acceptable to Enron and he has said that the Enron Board has decided that only the Legal Dept is authorized to agree changes to this figure - he thinks it may have to be Mark Haedicke but is not sure.  

Do you know whether there is any way we can get this figure down if it turns out to be a deal breaker?  If so, who should I liase with to get the necessary approval?

Thanks.

Jane
