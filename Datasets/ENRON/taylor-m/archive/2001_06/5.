Subject:=09Email Disk Space Options

The following information was provided by Cyndi Wulfson with the Outlook Mi=
gration Team.

Email Diskspace Usage Policy states that each user will be provided a Micro=
soft Exchange mailbox for use with Microsoft Outlook and that mailbox will =
be limited to a maximum storage limit of 100MB. It is important to note tha=
t the Global Messaging team had these mailbox capacity limits in Notes, how=
ever, they weren't strictly enforced. As we move to a new mail system, it i=
s critical that all users of Email understand their responsibilities of pro=
per Email usage, mail capacity policy enforcement and the resulting paradig=
m shift of how Enron utilizes eMail.
=20
Enron has a legal retention policy that states that backup tapes of Email a=
re kept a maximum of 8 days, items in folders older than 365 days are delet=
ed/purged, and therefore eMail should be thought of as temporary storage. I=
t is absolutely critical that as an Email user, we use Email as only the re=
ception point and initiation point of mail and not as storage.
=20
Ways of properly storing mail and mail contents are:
1.=09Detach attachments to the home directory (H:\). This will decrease the=
 overall size of one's mail file significantly. A user must be very diligen=
t about this routine of receiving and detaching attachments to h:\.=20
2.=09Deleting unneccessary Email from mailbox folders and mailbox system fo=
lders such as the Sent Mail folder. One would be surprised at how many time=
s one attachment or large message is floating around in their mailbox as co=
nversation threads.=20
3.=09Review and follow the recommendations for conserving diskspace and cus=
tomizing your Outlook mailbox for more efficient identification and viewing=
 of mail sizes and conversation threads.=20
4.=09Additional diskspace can be requested through the eRequest system: htt=
p://itcapps.corp.enron.com/srrs/entry/srrs.asp  This requires approval from=
 the user's Vice-President or above and comes in 25 MB increments. Each 25 =
MB increment requires a separate eRequest and approval.=20
5.=09Public Folders can be requested through the eRequest system: http://it=
capps.corp.enron.com/srrs/entry/srrs.asp  Public Folders can be an addition=
al place for shared group information, group calendars, or personal mail st=
orage. The name Public Folders is misleading - they are essentially folders=
 that reside on an Exchange server that can be viewed and used through Outl=
ook. They can be given rights to a single user or many users. Public Folder=
s still have the legal retention policy applied to them if they are used fo=
r mail storage, personal or shared.
