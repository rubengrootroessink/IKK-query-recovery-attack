Hi Mark,

Can you please take a look at this letter and see if you are acceptable to the changes requested by the counterparty. In case you are not the right person can you let me know who should take a look at this.

Dave:

I am back in the office from maternity leave.  PPL Montana is finally ready to use EOL and would like to finalize the attached letter, which I sent to them last winter.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Best,

Leslie
