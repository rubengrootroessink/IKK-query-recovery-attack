Hi Mark,

I will look at this in the next day but was wondering if you had any thoughts / questions?
JEB is our head of accounting and risk management.

All

Please find enclosed a memo describing the different options re. establishment on TOCOM, where costs, funding needs, equity needs, tax issues, timing and other relevant issues are discussed. Any feedback is highly appreciated. The plan is that when finalized, this memo will be presented to EGM's COO for final decision/approval. The plan is to present the memo by the end of this week. For your reference, please find enclosed Susan Musch's memo that takes the tax issue into more detail. Both memos are to be considered as drafts.

  

By looking at the different options, I clearly view option 1) as the most optimal one. Look forward to see your input.

Regards
Jan-Erland
