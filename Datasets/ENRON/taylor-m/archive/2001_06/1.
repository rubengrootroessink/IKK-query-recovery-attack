Hello Mark, 
Yes, it's that guy from Boston again.  This is my "every couple weeks, circle back with Enron to see if Mark has had a chance to contact the other groups he thinks might be interested in online contract negotiation" message.
Michael 
P.S.  Did you see the quote from the California Asst AG who wants to personally escort your Chairman to jail?  I wonder what office he's running for!

Vacations are my favorite reason for people not calling me back.  Hope you have a great time and that your cell phone never rings.
Talk to you at the end of May - 
Michael

Sorry I haven't been able to respond.  I have been swamped trying to get 
away for a vacation and in fact am leaving in the morning.  I will have to 
get back to you when I return which will not be until the 22nd.
