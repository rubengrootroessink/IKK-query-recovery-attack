Peter,

The usage of RMT is driven by a state tax planning structure that was imple=
mented in 1997/1998.  Simply put, by intermediating intercompany trades thr=
ough RMT we are able to lower Enron's Texas Franchise Tax significantly (in=
 fact, since rolling out the RMT structure we were able to reverse state in=
come tax reserves of approximately $50-60MM). =20

The Texas Franchise Tax is essentially a "pseudo" income tax that applies t=
o all companies doing business in the state of Texas.  Under the tax, Texas=
 sourced receipts are taxed at a rate of 4.25%.  Income from intangible pro=
perty (ie. income from trading contracts) is sourced based on the "location=
 of the payor".  In the case of corporations, the location of the payor or =
legal domicile is where the mind and management of the company is located. =
 (Obviously, for ENA and most of the domestic Enron affiliates the legal do=
micile is Texas).  Thus, prior to RMT, all trades between ENA and the domes=
tic affiliates were sourced to Texas for franchise tax purposes (which trad=
es were numerous as ENA was the risk management center for the Enron family=
).  RMT was established as a Delaware corporation with absolutely NO contac=
ts with Texas (ie. mind and management in Delaware) with a business purpose=
 of consolidating all of Enron's risk management activities.  By utilizing =
RMT as the counterparty on affiliate trades we are able to source a signifi=
cant portion of ENA's income away from Texas (and suprisingly enough, into =
Delaware -- which does not have an income based Franchise Tax).

The tension with the RMT structure is on the "business purpose".  In other =
words, we need to be very careful that we can show that RMT is acting as a =
true risk consolidating entity for Enron (thus, the reason for using RMT fo=
r international affiliates--including ECC).  With this in mind, we need to =
document the trades with RMT meticulously (must show that we document simil=
arly to what we do with third parties), including confirming all of the tra=
des.  While I can appreciate that this causes quite a bit of administrative=
 burden, I think we should continue to confirm with RMT until we can show t=
hat it is no longer Enron's business practice to send out confirms.  (Just =
FYI -- we just successfully completed a Texas franchise tax audit which uph=
eld the integrity of RMT, but only after providing details as to how RMT pr=
operly documented the intercompany transactions).

Sorry to be so long winded, but I thought you could appreciate some of the =
background.  Please give me a call so that we can discuss further.  Thanks.

MRC

Please see attached response from Mark T.

If tax and audit is OK, we can do away with RMT/ENA Confirms.  Morris/Laura=
?

With respect to EOL transactions and doing away with Confirms for certain c=
ounterparties, you will see from Mark's note that this is still a work in p=
rocess, and Confirms still need to go out.

Mark:  I thought there was only ONE Mark Taylor - I will leave it to others=
 to determine whether it is a good or bad thing that there are two of you k=
icking around.  If I were you I would tell IT to back off and then try arb =
HR by using the confusion to receive to paychecks.  I am happy to help re: =
Canadian Law if you want to look into an agreement re: the EOL Confirms for=
 designated Canadian counterparties.

Peter. =20

Regarding the need for the RMT confirms, I have always thought this was rea=
lly a tax issue and that for audit purposes they were needed.  If that is n=
ot the case, I don't object to doing away with them altogether.

We have approved doing away with confirms for EOL trades on a counterparty =
by counterparty basis.  We haven't actually gotten there with anyone yet, h=
aving just started the actual discussions this week.  Our plan was to negot=
iate an written agreement with each affected counterparty to amend the mast=
er agreements where appropriate.  Initially we are only working on physical=
 power, physical natural gas and derivatives transactions (other than weath=
er).  The idea is that a lawyer from each affected group would be involved =
to insure that all of the bases are properly covered.  This will obviously =
be a very time-consuming and laborious process.  The initial list of 10 or =
15 counterparties to approach was selected by the back office people.  Our =
conclusion that this was even possible was based only on Texas and New York=
 law analysis.  If any Canadian deals are at issue, we will need to get you=
 involved both for the analysis and the negotiations.

Hope this is helpful.  Let me know if it makes sense to you.

Mark

P.S. -- Please be careful when sending e-mails to me.  There are two Mark T=
aylors and we're hard to tell apart.  The other guy has his middle initial =
("A") in some of the lists and sometimes there is a globe next to his name,=
 but not mine.  My name usually has my phone number next to it.  We're tryi=
ng to get the IT people to do something to better distinguish us.

Mark, I wanted to track down two procedural matters with you respecting fin=
ancial confirms:

1.=09Currently we generate approximately 40-50 confirmations each day betwe=
en ECC and ENA/RMT, which creates some significant administrative and filin=
g burdens.  I am generally aware, but not precisely clear on the details, t=
hat there has been a recent decision that for certain counterparties, or at=
 least with respect to EOL transactions, that Confirms are no longer necess=
ary.  If in fact this is the case, can we do away with the formal confirmat=
ion procedures between ECC and ENA/RMT where there is not likely to be any =
dispute.  [Morris/Laura, if we do away with the formal confirms between ECC=
 and ENA/RMT, and provided that we have a TAGG or Sitara Deal Ticket, is th=
ere any ancillary tax purpose for generating confirms between ECC and ENA/R=
MT?]

2.=09In the same vein, for certain non-inter-company financial transactions=
 completed on EOL, I understand that it has been approved not to send Confi=
rms.  Again, Mark can you please clarify this policy for me, including how =
we determine for which counterparties this ought to apply in Canada.  It wa=
s my (again general) understanding that it may have depended upon the wordi=
ng of the Master Agreement with the counterparty and/or the volume of  tran=
sactions executed with the counterparty.

Please let me know.

Regards,
