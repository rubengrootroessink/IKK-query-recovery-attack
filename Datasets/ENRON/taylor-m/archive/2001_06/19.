Leslie-- As discussed, attached are the four EOL product definition texts I have prepared in consultation with Doug Gilbert-Smith and other persons involved with ERCOT wholesale power trading activities.  The new ERCOT marketplace goes into effect Friday July 6, 2001, but Monday July 9 would be fine for the institution of these products, particularly if the process is simplified by starting these products contemporaneous with the Firm(LD) changeover referenced in your e-mail below.  I have drafted a banner as to the "ERCOT-wide" product, which may be changed as necessary -- Doug is okay with being referenced as a contact person in such banner.  Please contact me with any questions.  --David

Please create the new US East power product set out below as soon as possible.  As we discussed, it should be ready for release on Monday, July 9.  Please call me with any questions or comments.

Thanks so much.
