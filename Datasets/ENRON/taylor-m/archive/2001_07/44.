Recently I have come into possession of copies of two (2) partially
executed documents between our companies, and I have been asked by my boss
to follow up to procure one (1) original of our Electronic Trading
Agreement and one (1) copy of our fully executed Password Application.

On January 3, 2000 our counsel, Elaine M. Walsh, both faxed and FedEx'd
three items to you--an EnronOnline Electronic Trading Agreement, Password
Application, and Customer Registration Form.  Again, if you would be so
kind as to forward one of the originals of the Trading Agreement and one
copy of the Password Application, I would greatly appreciate it.  If you
have, in fact, already returned an original to us way back when, I would be
grateful to receive a copy of this fully executed document.

Very many thanks.

Sincerely,
Elise M. Devlin
