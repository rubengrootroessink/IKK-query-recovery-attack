Mark -

I've left messages over the past month for several people in Legal, but have received no response; hence this message to you in hopes you can direct me to who I should be talking to.

I believe I'm listed as an officer on various Enron companies, including EPMI, for which I had to be fingerprinted for some type of California regulatory requirements.  Given the level of legal conflict etc. in California, and simply because it seems reasonable that I should understand if I have any exposure by being named an officer, I'd like to discuss it with one of our lawyers.  I've heard of D&O insurance, but really don't know what exactly that's for, whether I'm covered, and why I might even need it.

Of course this isn't something that keeps me up at night, but I would like to understand the significance and potential exposure, if any, of being named an officer of these subsidiaries.

Thanks for your help,

Cassandra.
