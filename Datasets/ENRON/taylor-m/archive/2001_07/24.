Mary,

Please let me know who in the SWAP Group should get these ISDAs now that Bob Bruce will not be handling.

Yes, I'd prefer that someone in the swaps group move forward on these files.  All I did on either of them was review the original draft.  -- thanks, Bob

Bob,

Ed Sacks asked that the following Con Ed Subs be added to the SWAP Group Legal/Credit list:


				Consolidated Edison Energy, Inc.
				Consolidated Edison Solutions, Inc.

Please advise if you will still handle the ISDA negotiations or if you would prefer that a lawyer in the SWAP Group pick-up these counterparties.

Just let me know.
 
Cordially,
