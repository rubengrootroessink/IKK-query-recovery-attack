Tom -


Here is a quick opinion Sullivan and Cromwell issued regarding the sale of equity interests in a CL company to competitors in the marketplace and the general feeling relating to antitrust issues.  I have also attached a copy of a presentation that I recently gave on the topic for your information.

Let me know if you should need anything further.

Mark
