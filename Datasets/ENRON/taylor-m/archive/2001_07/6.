Dear all,

After having consulted with my colleagues, here is our pinch of salt.

We believe markets participants would be interested in the following topics:

*	E-Commerce Panel Discussion: 	why some platforms succeed and
others do not (e.g Enron vs. ICE)
					the impact of e-trading on
standardized documentation


*	Convergence of Trading Forms:	role of a master master in energy
markets/cross product netting
					how to deal with different
standardized documentation in Europe for similar products, e.g. EFET, GTMA


*	Workshop One:			collateralization of physical gas
and electricity transactions under the CSA

My esteemed colleague Rita is happy to present a paper on the development of
the EFET gas master and/or coal trading and has also volunteered to
participate to one panel. I have also asked another colleague to give an
update on the status of EFET for power trading in Continental Europe (I
don't have his reply yet).

Best Regards

Christophe Chassard
