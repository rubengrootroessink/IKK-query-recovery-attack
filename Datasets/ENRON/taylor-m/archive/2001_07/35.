The notice address is ok.  But the other provision is not.  Cargill has to agree to reverse the trade.  It is their Master Agreement, not Global's.  Neither I nor Mark will approve the document until that concept is accepted by Cargill.  Someplace along the line they have to step up to the plate.  Also, I have talked to Paul Radous and he is very serious about Bill Bradford seeing and approving the letter before it is executed.  Thanks, Frank

only two changes from our end include:

change in email address from goldstein and
alfano to a shared trader's email address

and further clarification on reversal of a
transaction - by Global as agent for Cargill.
