Absolutely!  The rolodex on the system is user friendly.  I'll start with the address below and go from there.

What should we do about keeping track of names, phone numbers etc. for me?  Is it time to start with one of the programs now available?

I received all the paperwork from you, thanks. Just as a note, the reason I
didn't receive the first package is due to a wrong address. My current
address is 666 5th Ave, NYC, NY 10103.I do need one more signature from
you.I will e-mail the form and you can fax it back to me. My fax # is
212-765-1057. Thanks. JL
