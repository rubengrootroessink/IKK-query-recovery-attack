Mary, the file will be ready for your review, as Keegan and I are completed the second final revisions.  Please let me know if you would like to review it today.  

Otherwise, Mark, let me know when you would like to schedule a time to review it together.  Today is a good day for me.

Since you were unable to get this file to me timely prior to my vacation as requested, I have asked that Mark Taylor sit with you and review the file to get it out this week.  Please coordinate with Mark for a time when you can review it with him.  I spoke with Brian Loubert regarding the acceptance countersignatures of the Enron guaranty and he will look into it and contact Panus.  Thanks.

Cordially,
