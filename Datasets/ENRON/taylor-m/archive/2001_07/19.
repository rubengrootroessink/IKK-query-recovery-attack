Mark -

A question came up today about the Password Application and the provision restricting the use of the password to the country in which the company applying for the password is located.  

Sunoco is looking to sign up and has two agents in London who do US trades.  They wanted to know how the provision impacts this trading activity and, if it does prohibit the use of the password in the UK for US trades, is there a way to address this so that these agents can do work for Sunoco.

Please let me know your thoughts when you get a chance.

Thanks.


Mark
