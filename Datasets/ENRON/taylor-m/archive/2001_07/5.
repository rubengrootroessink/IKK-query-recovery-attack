Mike,

From Dan Rogers' office I understand that you are the contact person for legal review and approval in regards to crude & refined products (please let me know if this is not correct).  As part of the immediate PR/media outreach for this group, we developed a set of brief key messages for external/internal audiences.  Attached please find a copy of the document for your review and approval.  Please feel free to contact me at x55373 with questions or concerns.  Thank you in advance for your time and cooperation.
