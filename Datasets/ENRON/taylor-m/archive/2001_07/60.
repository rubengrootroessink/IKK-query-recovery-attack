Scott -

We have a new development effort under way for Enron Credit Inc.  This entity is an offshoot of our Enron Credit Ltd. group based in London.  Basically, Enron Credit has developed credit risk based products that basically hedge against bankruptcies and bad credit of customers.  The product described below - Risk Track - is a new product that is being developed for purposes of enabling Risk Metrics Group (credit risk company based in New York) to stream Enron Credit's credit information through a web based site to Risk Metrics Group subscribers.

The actual product has been developed, but in discussions with our business personnel it was determined that they would like to confirm that the RiskTrack does not violate any existing trademarks.  Accordingly, please have a basic trademark search performed for this name based upon the information provided below.  If additional information is needed, please let me know.

Thanks.  Have a good weekend.

Mark

Here's the blurb you requested:

"RiskTrack"

A web-based data distribution application that delivers credit risk information on both single-name corporate entities and indices. 

Thanks again,
Brian
