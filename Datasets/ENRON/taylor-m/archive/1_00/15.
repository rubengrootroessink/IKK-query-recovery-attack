Subject: New phone numbers and whereabouts



Louise -

I haven't heard from you since I left you messages regarding the delay
to mid-December regarding the legal proceedings. I want to make you
aware of a couple of things:

1) We are moving our offices in Chicago. Effective Monday, November 22,
my telephone number will be 312 729 4567.

2) Without going into too much detail, my availability over the next few
days will be spotty. I will likely not be as responsive to v-mail or
e-mail as usual. My wife and I are dealing with some serious medical
issues concerning her.

I hope all is well.

Thanks,
Dave

Subject: EES



Louise -

I am hearing some concerning comments from my folks working with Enron
Energy Services. In essence, they are saying that ECT is telling EES not
to work with us. I don't know if that is exactly how it is being stated,
but that is the essence of it.

I hope this is not the case and ask for any insights you have into this.
I know that there have been issues including the litigation. However, I
believe we have demonstrated a desire and a willingness to work with you
in any way possible to make this project a success. We had to take the
legal action when we did or basically forfeit our rights. However, we
have agressively worked to push out the hearing date as not to impact
Enron. That is the sole reason we pushed it out. If it weren't for your
'going live' date, we would have greatly preferred the hearing date was
sooner rather than later.

Please let me know any insights you have into this.

Thank you.
Dave

Louise -

Two things:

1) We are moving the Chicago office this weekend. Unfortunately, the
phone numbers won't transfer. My new number is 312 729 4567. The fax is
312 729 4540.

2) I saw an e-mail go by regarding a press release. It was being sent to
Paul Herring to get Enron's approval for after the November 29th launch.
I want to make sure we are in synch regarding this. I haven't been in
the loop with this recently and I know that we had talked about either a
joint release or a seperate release after the launch. Please let me know
what you would like to do. Paul has a copy of the proposed release that
we definitely will run by Enron if going the seperate route is OK with
you.

Thanks,
Dave

Louise -

I apologize for the hub-bub surrounding the press release. This is the
e-mail from late October that I thought captured what we (Enron and
AGENCY.COM) were going to do. I originally sent it to Monica Fried
copying you and Maddie.

I will give you a call to discuss. I would like to see 2) happen as soon
as reasonable. Did anything happen on 1)? I sent an e-mail giving you
permission to use AGENCY.COM and asked to see the copy. I never did see
it.

Thanks and again, sorry about the hub bub.

Monica -

In discussions today with Louise Kitchen, Enron indicated that they
would like to do the following instead of having AGENCY.COM do a
seperate release at this time:
1) In the FAQs on the site regarding this application, include
AGENCY.COM as the web services consulting firm that Enron worked with on
the project.
2) At the time of the official launch, Enron would like to release
another press release that includes AGENCY.COM.

I believe this is what we should do. If you have issues, please call me
to discuss. If you are fine with this, Enron needs us to send them a
letter indicating that they have our permission to place our information
in the FAQs.  Do you take care of that or should the delivery team?

Thanks,
Dave

All -

I just got off the phone with Louise Kitchen. They are having a meeting
tomorrow to discuss PR. She will send me an e-mail (I'm not in the
office until Monday) about the direction they are taking. While they are
excited about the application and confident that it will work well, they
have some concerns that there will be issues when they first go live
that they would prefer to deal with somewhat quietly. Put another way,
they are leaning towards being low-keyed until they are confident the
system IS working very well (ie, it has been live for a bit) as opposed
to BELIEVING/HOPING it will work well and making a big deal BEFORE it
goes live.

I know I'm somewhat conservative in these matters, but that makes a
whole lot of sense to me.

At this point, let me take the lead on this. Who from AGENCY.COM PR
should I work with? Monica? Tari? Everyone else need not worry about it
unless you hear from me.

Thanks,
Dave

PS She did say that their PR guy had created some FAQs where we are
mentioned. She will be forwarding them to me for my review. I believe
these will go up on the site.

Maybe I don't understand exactly how these are being used. My understanding 
is that
they will be posted on your website for access by anyone (as opposed to just 
Enron
employees). If this is correct, why do you wish to include Q3? I've seen 
numerous
FAQs in my professional career and have never seen a question such as that. 
In my
mind, its inclusion raises questions in and of itself and I would like to 
have it
excluded.

The other two questions are fine. For branding purposed, please refer to us as
AGENCY.COM as oppose to Agency.com.

Thanks,
Dave

Louise -

I have put a couple of calls into your Houston number, but have heard
nothing back. I wanted to brief you on the final invoice and make a
request to meet with you to perform a final project performance review.

Regarding the invoice:

As we discussed when the 'soft launch' invoice went out with some
disputed rates, we scrubbed all past invoices to ensure we were using
the proper rates. In those instances where the rates were higher than
the contract, we have made adjustments to credit Enron the excess on the
final invoice. This adjustment took into consideration all incorrect
rates from the beginning of the project.

In those cases where the rates were lower than the contract, we have
taken no action other than to charge the proper rates for the period
from the 'soft launch' invoice to the final invoice. For the period
prior to the 'soft launch' invoice, we have left them at the lower rate.
This is as we discussed.

The total credit as a result of this analysis is approximately $34,000.

Additionally, we did some analysis of the turnover on the project and
ramp-up time for the replacements. We have included a credit of $54,000
on the final invoice to help defray these costs.

Regarding Project Performance Review:

Darrell Balmer (who reports to Chan and is our EVP, Employee and Client
Satisfaction) and I would like to meet with you and whoever you think
appropriate to discuss AGENCY.COM's performance on this engagement. I
know that you have information and insights that we greatly value and
which, when we act upon them, will further improve AGENCY.COM's ability
to meet its clients' needs. Darrell has a trip planned to Dallas for the
end of the first week of January. If at all possible, we would like to
schedule some time with you on Thursday, January 6th assuming you'll be
in Houston. If this doesn't work for you, please contact me to discuss
alternatives.

I hope you have a wonderful holiday.

Thank you,
Dave
