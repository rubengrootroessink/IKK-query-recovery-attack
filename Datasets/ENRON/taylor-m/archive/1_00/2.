Christian Yoder suggested I contact you concerning required disclosure 
statements on an Enron web site.  The Portland office is establishing a 
customer web site.  The site will provide pricing history, commentary, 
studies etc.  We need to determine what type of disclosure statement we need 
to include in this site.  Can you help me with this?  I will call on Friday.
