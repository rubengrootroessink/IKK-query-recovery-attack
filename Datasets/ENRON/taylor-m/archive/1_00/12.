Attached for your information is the latest advice on the introduction of 
EnronOnline to Australia. I'm not sure how close you want to follow progress 
but I'll copy you in until you say to stop .

 There are no  regulatory or contractual concerns that might delay 
implementation . However, there will need to be some more work on regulatory 
issues when we extend EnronOnline to non-electricity commodity derivatives.   

Last year I drafted GTCs for Power trades and amended the Password Agreement 
and ETA. These are with outside counsel for external review. 

If there are going to be any legal issues they are more likely to be on 
procedural matters. For example it is not clear yet which office 
counterparties wishing to open an account will call. If it is not here then 
we will need to develop a protocol to ensure legislative requirements in 
checking potential counterparties are followed.
     
I am working with our people developing  product descriptions.
