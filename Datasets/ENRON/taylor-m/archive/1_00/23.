Subject: Recipient of Master User ID

We have asked the EnronOnline team to send the Master User ID and Password to 
the person who signed the PA.  Our theory was that the signer presumably has 
the authority to bind the counterparty and understands that any holder of the 
password can also bind the counterparty.  If they want to give it to someone 
else, so be it.  But we should not be taking it upon ourselves to send the 
password to someone else unless we have conducted the same level of due 
diligence on that name as we have on the PA signer.  I was told we were not 
looking into the authority of the "nominated" Master Users inn any way but 
that we were taking some steps to verify the authority of the PA signers.  It 
just seemed safer to me to take this approach.
