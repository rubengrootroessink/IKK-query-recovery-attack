Attention All UBSW Energy Employees:

In preparation for the email migration this weekend, your Outlook email (including Outlook Web Access and Blackberry email service) will be intermittently unavailable throughout the weekend starting at 6 p.m. CST tonight. Your mailbox will be moved to an isolated UBS Exchange server tonight and available during business hours tomorrow.  If you are a Blackberry user, you will want to re-cradle your Blackberry device after your mailbox move on Friday. Blackberry Pin to Pin will continue to function throughout the weekend.  On Monday, you can expect to find your new mailbox with Contacts, Calendar, Tasks and other items as outlined in the Data Migration Protocol email you received earlier this week.

We appreciate your cooperation in this effort,

UBSW Energy Global Messaging
