Subject: The Plan!

We have started to contact EnronOnline customers with regard to the EBS 
connection to EnronOnline - I am pretty sure that the strategy is as set out 
below.  Please let me know if anyone thinks differently.

The connections will be T1, as opposed to larger DS3 connections.  Originally 
it had been envisaged that DS3s would be provisioned in order to then upsell 
rich content.  As EnronOnline only requires a T1 or less, it has been decided 
that at this time, it would be more appropriate to provision the T1s.

EBS will contract directly for the full connection service with the 
EnronOnline customer (eg Dynegy and EBS).  

EBS will bill the customer directly in accordance with the cost sharing 
arrangement which the EnronOnline team negotiates with the customer.  For 
example, EnronOnline pays for the network portion with the customer paying 
for the local loop and any router charges.

Customers will receive the connection in approximately 45 (+ or minus 15 
days).

EBS currently has a list of all companies to be connected in Phase 1.  (David 
Mims)

EBS to furnish EnronOnline with the costs as soon as possible in order for 
EnronOnline to agree a cost sharing arrangement with its customers.

Should work I think - we look forward to faster trading.
