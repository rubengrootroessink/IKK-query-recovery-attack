David-

Thank you for passing the Australian GTC's on to us.  As to B&M's position on 
the gambling issue, they are not prepared to provide us with a clean opinion, 
however they will specify how we might minimize the associated risks, which 
appear to be minimal.  I expect to receive their formal advice today and 
will  forward same upon receipt.

The Enron company that is specified on the Passwords Applications and ETAs 
that are being sent out is presently ENA.  

Cheers,

John

John please see attached GTCs for Australian weather. They are essentially 
the same as the example that was forwarded to B&M when they got the brief to 
advise on weather derivatives last month. 

I understand that B & M are having second thoughts on the gambling question 
and are due to come in with an advice on the point. 

There is also a question as to whether the Enron party will be Enron 
Australia Finance Pty. Ltd. or Enron Japan KK. From a tax perspective Susan 
what would you prefer? 

On a related issue what Enron company is on the Passwords Applications and 
ETAs that are being sent out? Although from a legal perspective it does not 
matter it may increase acceptance if it were Enron Japan KK.
