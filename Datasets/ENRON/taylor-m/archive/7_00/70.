Mark,

I seem to recall from our earlier conversation that London can trade on the 
PULPEX but cannot trade as a marketmaker.  That can only be done out of 
Houston.  Is this understanding correct? and if so, why is that?  The reason 
why I ask is that eventually we would like to move the marketmaking function 
over to London.

regards
steve
