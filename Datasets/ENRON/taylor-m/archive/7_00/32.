David,

Attached please find the website text for the Capacity Generation Auction. I 
have made some changes and added a couple of new pages. Please review the 
changes (marked). Furthermore, I added a Bid page and a Bid List. This two 
pages are used as visual references by our developers. We need to make sure 
that they are correct, so please verify the information on them. Also, you 
need to come up with a short reference for your two products so they can fit 
on the drop down boxes and in the Bid List.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks!
