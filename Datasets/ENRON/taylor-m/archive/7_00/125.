Here is the offending piece from the SFA.  As you will see, it is not a 
binding piece of regulation, but merely a non-binding "Discussion Paper".  In 
fact it is even less binding than "Consultation" documents (also non-binding) 
which SFA put out following the discussion phase.

It does, however, provide some insight into how the SFA might regulate 
systems in the future.

I get about one of these a day from SFA and must say I missed this one.  I 
will ask our external counsel (Linklaters) to watch out for any SFA 
publications which may be relevant to Enron Online going forward and to bring 
them to our attention.  I suggest Justin and Edmund also stress this to any 
other external English counsel who may be advising us on Online.
