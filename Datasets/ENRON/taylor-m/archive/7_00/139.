Please find my comments attached.

I am hoping to get a quote on the professional liability insurance this
week.  Two of the underwriters called my broker to get further information
on Monday of last week, and two declined to quote because of they will
not underwrite anything having to do with commodities.  I am also expecting
a quote from the broker which Intelligence Press uses.
