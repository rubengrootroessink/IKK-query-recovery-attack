Mark,

Can you commence the process for ETA's and PA's for Bermuda?

Please advise as to how long you think this may take - and if the cost to us 
is likely to exceed $US 22,000

Thanks,

Dave

Dave, we'll pay the 15,000 pounds for the research on Bermuda law so that 
Bermuda companies like Commercial Risk can transact on Enron OnLine.
