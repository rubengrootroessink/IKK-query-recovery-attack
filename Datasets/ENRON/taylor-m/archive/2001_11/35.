Deb,

That was an entity that Lavorato asked us to set up as an alternative to
Swapco in a non-bankruptcy, non-Dynegy scenario, so Mark Taylor would know
about it.  It was supposed to be SOG Corp., but that name was not available
so we started adding letters on until we got one that worked (the state of
Delaware was holding on the phone).  I would imagine that we will dissolve
this entity.  I will check with Stuart and Mark.

As for Swapco, I am going through the documents and will send you an email
listing all the signatures/action items we still have outstanding in order
to wrap this up.

Thanks for you help.

Regards,
Trish
