Wally's drafts of these documents seem fine to me from a United States perspective.  As we discussed, I believe that a transaction where, in effect, a shareholder's right to redemption/liquidation proceeds and dividends is reduced would be analyzed as a redemption for United States federal income tax purposes.

Just want to make sure that I'm not missing anything--I have documents relating to the transaction between Enron and Enron Canada, and Enron Canada and Enron Canada Power, but nothing relating to the transfer between Enron Canada Power and ERMT Canada Corp. and nothing relating to the "drop down" of the note.  Is that correct?

Steve, as I mentioned, I will not be in the office tomorrow or Friday.  However, I will take my "picture" with me from our conversations today and if you need me, please let Lorna, my secretary know; she will put you in touch with me.

Best regards,
Kathy
