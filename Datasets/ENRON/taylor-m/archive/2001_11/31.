Dear Trish:

Attached is a draft of our Services  Agreement for CGNN Holding Company,
Inc.  If this form is acceptable I will  draft a similar agreement for ERMT
LLC (modified to include the non-economic  member).

The independent director for ERMT LLC will  be Bernard J. Angelo and the
golden shareholder will be GSS Contract Services I,  Inc., a Delaware
corporation.

Please feel free to call me with any  questions or comments that you may
have.

Best regards.
