Mark - I assume that Peter or someone in Canada is going to take care of
the ERMT Canada name change - I would suggest NETCO Canada Corp., as we are
planning on calling LLC "NETCO Holdings LLC" and ERMT Corp. "The New Energy
Trading Company".  Just let me know - Thanks.

Also, where do you want to put new Wrapco - underneath ENA or ENE?  or RMT
for that matter.
