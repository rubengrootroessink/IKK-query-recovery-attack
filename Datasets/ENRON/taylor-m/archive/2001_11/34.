Mark and Deb - just for your information, in the event that we would for
any reason need to do any additional corporate filings for the swapco
entities, I just wanted to remind you guys that the Delaware secretary of
state's office is closed on Monday for Veteran's Day - I don't think we
have anything else to file right now, but just in case something different
comes up over the weekend, we wouldn't be able to file anything until
Tuesday.  Thanks.
