Anne:
Here is a copy of the revised license agreement reflecting the information
that you forwarded.

I also added a sentence to require that Enron list any "necessary"
third-party software.  If you think it is unnecessary, feel free to pull it
out.  I just added it for additional protection for Swapco.

I have included a blackline for review purposes and a clean copy.

Please call me at 650-802-3087 with any questions or comments.

Regards,
Roger
