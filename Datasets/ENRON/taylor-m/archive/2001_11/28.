Attached is a Shareholders Resolution authorizing the  name change.  I think we have the Shareholder Name correct, but if not, the  file is in word format and can be easily amended.  We are scanning the  other incorporation documents and will send shortly.  
 
The articles of amendment will be prepared and filed first  thing tomorrow as soon as we receive confirmation that the new name is not  conflicting with an existing name.  This is a NUANS search which has been  ordered, but not received yet.
 
Regards Mungo
