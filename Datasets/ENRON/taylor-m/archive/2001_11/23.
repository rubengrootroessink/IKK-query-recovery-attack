Please find attached for execution are the following documents necessary to
change the names of ERMT LLC to "NETCO Holdings Corp." and ERMT Corp. to
"The New Energy Trading Company":

1.   Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation;
2.   Written Consent of Stockholder of ERMT Corp. approving same;
3.   Written Consent of Board of ERMT Corp. approving same;
4.   Certificate of Amendment to Certificate of Formation of ERMT LLC.

We will probably amend the LLC agreement later and reflect the name change
as well as anything else that comes up, but these documents will allow us
to file the name changes and have them effective today.  Please let me know
when you are able to get these executed and I will have Ann work with NRA
and get them filed this afternoon.  Thanks.
