Once the agreement is signed, it would prohibit us from issuing the golden
share, as well as the shares to ENA for enron online, unless we put that on
the disclosure schedule.  However, since I don't know that we can get a
golden shareholder today, we should probably consider putting this on the
disclosure schedule to the merger agreement.  Is it problematic for you to
disclose this to the other side?  If so, we might be able to have the
golden interest issued to an individual who can later transfer them to a
coporate shareholder.  Let me know what you think.

Under normal circumstances we would not need an Enron Corp. resolution
and in fact the Corporate Secretary and Treasury offices can handle
moving the money around so we do not propose to do an Enron Corp. Board
action unless you folks think it is absolutely necessary.  The other
resolutions we can get in place easily.

I think Notre Dame agreement contains restrictions on what we can do
with capital stock of subsidiaries after it is signed -- does that mean
we need to issue the Golden Share today?
