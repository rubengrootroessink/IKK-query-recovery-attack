For Safety's Sake

Winter brings early evening darkness, fun holiday shopping and
unfortunately an increase in crime. As our neighborhood flourishes it
becomes a more appealing target to the wrong elements.   While our
neighborhood crime rate is increasing, so too is the response from HPD.
Representatives from the Houston Police Department ("HPD")  will be
featured at the 7:00 PM meeting of the Houston Heights Association to be

held on Monday, January 14, 2002.   We will be fortunate that evening to

have HPD's Captain Yorek, from our own local area  police store front,
to
keep us abreast of the latest efforts being made to protect you.
Increased
bike patrols, personnel reallocations, graffiti removal teams, gang
response units and garage sting operations are just a few of the topics
that will be discussed.
One of the most important factors in helping insure we have a safe
community, is our individual responsibility as neighbors in helping our
area police officers.  Our role, as their additional eyes and ears to
help
spot crime, is critical in insuring HPD resources are effectively
utilized.
Come and learn how to be prepared, what to watch out for, tips for
protecting your family and your home.  Bring your neighbor.  Get your
questions answers .  Bring your kids and meet some of the real heroes
that
serve all of us around the clock.  Get informed and become part of the
solution.
