Dear Mr. Portz, 
My name is Tracey Yasunaga, and I'm a conference producer at Euromoney Training, a division of Institutional Investor. Currently, I'm brainstorming ideas for our first legal conference, targeted at in-house lawyers, scheduled for 2 consecutive days in March 2002.  If you could offer some ideas concerning what's "hot" on the market, what legal challenges you are currently facing today, or any other legal topic that may be of interest in March 2002, your input would be much appreciated.
Best regards, 
Tracey Yasunaga
