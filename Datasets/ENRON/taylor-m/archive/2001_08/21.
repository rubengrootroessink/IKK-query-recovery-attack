Mark,

My records show that the EOL Amendments for the following companies were sent to you on 7/26 and 7/31.  Can you tell me which attorney has which amendment so that we can finalize these and send them out to the respective counterparties?

	Entergy-Koch
	Dynegy
	BP
	Williams
	Reliant
	Mirant
	Cook Inlet

Thanks for your assistance.
