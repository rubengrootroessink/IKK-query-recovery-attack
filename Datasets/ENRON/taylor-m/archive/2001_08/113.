Peter -

Here is the Legal Outline Memorandum I prepared for the client on the IP acquisition file we discussed.  As you will see, there are a lot of issues that need to be addressed.  Once we determine who in your shop will be handling this, I can supplement the attached with hard copies of the documents that I have - which are very few.

Thanks.

Mark
