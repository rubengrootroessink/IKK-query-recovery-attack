Mark,

We have recently completed our Gas Trading Audit.  From our audit, we
identified an item to be addressed pertaining to legal's involvement in the
confimation process.  Throughout our audit, we were in contact with Jeff
Hodge; however, since our action item pertains to both physical and
financial deals, I wanted to forward this item to you for your review.
(Item D in the high priority section)

(See attached file: Natural Gas Trading.ppt)

Upon review, please let me know if you have any questions and/or comments.

Thank you,

Sharon
