Mark,

Here is the entire long description as would be modified per Larry May.  Al=
so, in regards to your concerns about the short description the reason we  =
have such a constraint on these particular options is the length of the Ind=
ex name. Let me know your thoughts on this as well. If Larry is okay with i=
t we may be able to shorten the index name slightly.

Thanks,
Lindsay
