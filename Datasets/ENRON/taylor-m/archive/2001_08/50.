Global-Energy: ICE to Offer Clearing for Oil, NatGas=20

Online commodities trading market IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) announced =
on 29 August that the London Clearing House (LCH) would provide clearing se=
rvices for over-the-counter transactions of WTI crude and Henry Hub natural=
 gas once the Commodity Futures Trading Commission grants regulatory approv=
al, which is not expected before October.  LCH was the clearing house for I=
nternational Petroleum Exchange (IPE), which ICE recently bought.  Jeff Spr=
echer, ICE Chief Executive, said the clearing services could "open up new t=
rading opportunities, increase the velocity of trading, and increase compan=
ies' ability to take on new risk," according to Reuters.  A broker told Dow=
 Jones that the move by ICE was "the 'shot fired across the bow' of its lar=
ger-volume competitor NYMEX...[and] will allow ICE and IPE to compete direc=
tly with NYMEX for Brent-WTI arbitrage business," as NYMEX will begin offer=
ing Brent crude contracts on 5 September.  NYMEX also intends to launch its=
 online trading system, eNYMEX, within four to eight months.  <font color=
=3D"#0084A5">ANALYSIS:  Any trading market lives or dies on the quality of =
its clearance processes.  ICE, as one of the largest electronic trading for=
ums, is under constant pressure to offer new services, as it attempts to pu=
ll potential traders from other online ventures and traditional floor excha=
nges.  CEO Sprecher said ICE's goal was to "plug into (the already existing=
 futures market) infrastructure and develop a new paradigm for the OTC mark=
ets on some way of clearing, settling or netting," according to <i>Platts</=
i>.  NYMEX's electronic trading efforts are consistently delayed.</font>
