I have reviewed the MFN agreement and believe that should MFN fail to live =
up to its end of the Agreement our sole remedy is termination. (see section=
s extracted below).

I understand from Pete Castrejana that should MFN fail to provide service w=
e have no functionally equivalent fall-back position, at least in the short=
 term.  Given this, I believe we have placed ourselves in an unenviable ris=
k position going forward.
=20
It is my suggestion that irrespective of the resolution to this lien issue =
or MFN financing issues, we reopen negotiations to obtain the right to inte=
rvene and negotiate on our own behalf with any party contracted with by MFN=
.  We should attempt to include language which contractually binds MFN to m=
ake such contracted services and "Authorizations" assignable to us should M=
FN fail to perform. =20
=20
Termination as our sole remedy is, in this case, not sound risk mitigation.

Section 7.1 states [emphisis added]:

"Prior to delivery MFN will obtain all material and applicable authorizatio=
ns, leases, licenses, easements, rights of way, franchises, approvals, perm=
its, orders, consents, and all other rights required for MFN to operate and=
 maintain the MFN Network and provide Leased Fiber to Customer (collectivel=
y the "Authorizations"), and will use commercially reasonable efforts to ma=
intain or renew all such Authorizations throughout the Lease Term.  If any =
Authorizations are modified or terminated, threatening to cause or causing =
material financial harm to MFN, or preventing or materially interfering wit=
h MFN's control, possession and/or use of the MFN Network or its ability to=
 provide the Leased Fiber, then MFN, in its sole discretion will: (i) provi=
de Customer with a comparable product on alternate portions of MFN's then e=
xisting MFN Network or on networks of third parties, or (ii) terminate this=
 Agreement with respect to the affected Leased Fiber without further obliga=
tion or liability to Customer.  The forgoing is MFN's sole and exclusive li=
ability and Customer's sole and exclusive remedy with respect to terminatio=
n as a result of the loss of an Authorization."

Section 10 "LIMITATION OF LIABILITY; INDEMNIFICATION specifically excludes =
our seeking any consequential, punitive, indirect damages, or lost revenue =
even in the event of a breach of contract.
