Hey Mark -- Just checking in so you don't think I have forgotten you. I will
be waiting in the black Jeep outside of Continental's baggage claim area.
If I am not right there I might be circling to placate those annoying
traffic cops.  I won't be late.  My cell is 703-587-9245.  Amanda's is
703-598-8999.  See you on Saturday!

Bill
