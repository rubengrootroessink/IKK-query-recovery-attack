Mark - This is just a short note to revisit how and when we should be using the new setoff language.  A while ago I sent you my markup of our old language and then talked to you about when we should begin using it.  At that time you said that we should wait until we all get together and discuss it.   Needless to say, because of people's schedules we have not had a group meeting since that time.  Now I'm hearing from Francisco that you have indicated that we should be using it now.  Would you please clarify if we should be using the new language in the documents we are currently sending out and, if so, what form the language should take.  Thanks.
