ConfirmLogic will revolutionize the current method of confirming power tran=
sactions.  While the paperless confirmation process will generate much that=
 is positive, it also creates certain legal concerns for the power group.  =
Historically, the confirmation process has been used by the power group to =
address contractual inadequacies and ambiguities in product terms.  Confirm=
Logic is designed to confirm the basic commercial terms of standard transac=
tions.  It is not intended as a vehicle for confirming unique transactions,=
 addressing additional contractual terms or clarifying transaction terms.  =
Thus, we must employ appropriate guidelines to ensure that (1) only standar=
d power transactions are confirmed via ConfirmLogic and (2) necessary addit=
ional terms and conditions of confirmation are agreed to with a counterpart=
y prior to the implementation of ConfirmLogic with such counterparty. =20

I.=09Confirmation of Standard Transactions=20

We need to ensure that ConfirmLogic is used to confirm only standard power =
transactions.  If a transaction would  require a special confirmation templ=
ate or otherwise include special terms and conditions (e.g., an unusual pro=
duct such as 10-minute spinning reserve), such transaction is not appropria=
te for confirmation via ConfirmLogic.  There are a number of steps we could=
 take to help ensure that only appropriate transactions are confirmed by Co=
nfirmLogic.  (1) I proposed that EnPower and analogous deal entry systems i=
nclude a field where the trader designates whether the deal should be confi=
rmed by ConfirmLogic.  If the default were "No", the traders would be requi=
red to proactively designate if ConfirmLogic could be used.  Melissa Murphy=
 has indicated that the traders would strongly resist such a process.  Alte=
rnatively, Melissa and I discussed a two-step process whereby (a) we create=
 a Special Handling flag for the deal entry system so that if a trader has =
a trade with special terms and conditions, the trade is flagged and will no=
t flow to ConfirmLogic; and (b) the documentation group runs regular report=
s throughout the day listing all trades with comments added to the "Comment=
" section by the trader and pulls any trades from the ConfirmLogic website =
that require special handling (with the risk of the counterparty accepting =
the confirmation or automatic matching of the confirmation prior to the tim=
e the trade is pulled off the web.)   The success of this process would tur=
n upon adequate education of the traders and consistent monitoring by the d=
ocumentation group. (2)  According to Melissa Murphy, I believe we could al=
so code certain products types, e.g., 10 minute spinning reserve, so that t=
hey could not be confirmed by ConfirmLogic.  As new products were created, =
we would need to decide whether to code the product to allow confirmation b=
y ConfirmLogic. (3)  We could build a delay into the ConfirmLogic process t=
o ensure that the documentation group had time to review the deals flowing =
to ConfirmLogic before the counterparty can confirm the transaction.  For i=
nstance, if a deal with special terms was sent through ConfirmLogic, the do=
cumentation group could flag the transaction with the "Inquiry" status and =
notify the counterparty that the transaction should be confirmed in writing=
 to memorialize special terms and conditions.  However, CommodityLogic will=
 likely oppose this suggestion because they have marketed ConfirmLogic as "=
real time".

II.=09Additional Terms and Conditions of Confirmation
=20
=09Attached below please find the Form of Agreement Relating to Power Trans=
actions Confirmed by ConfirmLogic (the "Confirmation Agreement").  This is =
the type of document that we need to finalize with each power counterparty =
before transactions are confirmed by ConfirmLogic.  The CommodityLogic webs=
ite contains private and public folders that may be utilized by Enron to po=
st the Confirmation Agreement electronically.

=09We must be prepared to address changes in product terms and other contra=
ctual issues with each counterparty using ConfirmLogic.  Thus, we should ma=
intain a Confirmation Agreement database to track such counterparties.  We =
would need to update the Confirmation Agreements as changes to the product =
terms occur.  Moreover, as we negotiate new master agreements with such cou=
nterparties, we must be aware of the terms of the Confirmation Agreement an=
d address whether to conform the new master to the Confirmation Agreement o=
r incorporate the terms of the Confirmation Agreement into the new master a=
nd thus supersede the Confirmation Agreement. =20

=09While ConfirmLogic will post summaries of EnronOnline transactions, Enro=
nOnline transactions will not be confirmed on ConfirmLogic.  The ConfirmLog=
ic documentation makes clear that EOL transactions are posted for informati=
on purposes only will not be confirmed.  This is consistent with the direct=
ion we have been going for all EnronOnline transactions.  Janet Moore has b=
een involved in a project to discontinue the confirmation process for all E=
OL transactions with certain counterparties.   Enron will enter into agreem=
ents with certain counterparties whereby the parties agree (1) that EOL tra=
nsactions need not be confirmed, notwithstanding any terms in the underlyin=
g master agreement to the contrary, and (2) to additional terms of the tran=
saction previously captured by the confirmation process (the "EOL Agreement=
").   If we have already entered into an EOL Agreement with a counterparty,=
 we need not address EOL trades in the Confirmation Agreement.  However, if=
 we have not yet entered into an EOL Agreement with a counterparty, we can =
address all EOL issues in the Confirmation Agreement itself and thus obviat=
e the need for two separate agreements.=20

=09I look forward to any questions or suggestions you have relating to the =
issues raised in this e-mail.

Thanks,

Leslie
