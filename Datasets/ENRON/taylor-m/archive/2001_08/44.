	As you know, our group of attorneys within the Enron Wholesale Services Legal Department has recently grown substantially.  As a result, our space at the previously scheduled EWS Legal Conference at The Woodlands in October has become constrained, and we have outgrown our budget. Instead of having legal specialists attend the conference this year, we have scheduled a lunch on October 26, 2001 at the Doubletree Hotel from 12 to 3. We are scheduling several outside speakers to talk about current topics at the lunch. You will be getting further information from Lisa Mellencamp about the details, but please mark your calendars and plan on attending.
