In addition to the daily work,  this week I am actively working on the following ongoing matters:

ISDA Negotiations

-Welch's -- almost done

-Devon Energy -- almost done with third round

-Ispat Island -- almost done

-SoCAL ISDA comparison -- to begin tomorrow


Other
--Delouitte & Touche Engagement Letters -- this was an outstanding matter from GSS that I am working with Kim to make sure it gets done properly.  The balance of the deal is adminstrative, follow-up and flow through to Kim.

--Follow-up with Meetings with Fran Mayes
