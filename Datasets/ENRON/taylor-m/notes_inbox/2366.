Rick Causey recently announced a new online purchase and payment tool called 
iBuyit.  One of the special iBuyit components is an automated accounts 
payable feature that will improve the way you code and approve invoices. 

As of May 1, you will be able to access iBuyit Payables and
? choose budget codes from simple drop down menus
? receive e-mail when you have an invoice that needs to be coded and/or 
approved; and
? view an electronic image of the actual invoice

These improvements will help you assign codes more accurately and will reduce 
the time you spend processing invoices for payment.  The AP tool will also 
begin to eliminate the need for coding sheets or other paper information 
currently in use.  

This tool will provide us the opportunity to transition our Houston-based AP 
processing functions to a third party, SourceNet Solutions.  This transition 
is expected to be completed by August 2001.

You will hear more about the iBuyit initiative, features of the AP tool and 
training opportunities in the coming weeks.  Please contact your AP 
representative if you have any questions.
