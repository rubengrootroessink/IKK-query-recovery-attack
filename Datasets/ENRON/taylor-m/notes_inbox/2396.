As per your request, attached is a clean version of ERAC's GTCs rev1 dated

As indicated in John's email below, ERAC's GTC's have been modified to cover

Thanks John -

Nony, could you forward your final version of the GTC's - a non-red-lined

Thanks for all of your efforts in this product build-out.

Rob-

Attached hereto are both the ERAC on-line GTCs modified to cover exchanges 
and the related confirmation to be utilized for such on-line exchange 
transactions.  The modified ERAC on-line GTCs are redlined against the 
existing ERAC on-line GTCs, for your ease of reference.  These documents 
relate to the product description as modified and sent to you on 2-27-01.

Following your review of the documents, please contact me to discuss any 
questions or comments that you may have.

Thanks,

John
