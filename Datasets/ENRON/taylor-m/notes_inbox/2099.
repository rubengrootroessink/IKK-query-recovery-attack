EnronOnline Houston:

Here are the names of your EnronOnline Europe counterparts regarding the 
Tanker Freight Swap:

EnronOnline London Legal ----------> Robert Quick  Phone: +442077837265
[should be able to answer your legal questions]

EnronOnline London Operations --> Arfan Aziz  Phone: +442077835378  
[should be able to tell you about how they calculate settlement prices; that 
is, should have access to backoffice formulas in the EOL system]

Please expedite the product approval process in any way that you can.  It has 
been over one week since the initial request and this Tanker Freight Swap 
product is not radically different from one that has been trading over in 
London for months.

Please contact me if you need any additional information,
Homer
