Mark,

Paul would like to start his roadshow with Australian customers next Tuesday 
(Monday afternoon, our time).

Could you please review the amendments which David Minns has recommended for 
the PA and  ETA today, so that Paul can take a copy of at least the PA with 
him when he visits the customers?

Thanks,

Dave
