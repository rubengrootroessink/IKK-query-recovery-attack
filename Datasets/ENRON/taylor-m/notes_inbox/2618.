Trafigura Derivatives Limited (CPID 65211) has contacted Tracy Wallace (UK 
LPG trader) to request that they have execute access to US LPG products. This 
counterparty is based in the UK and was reviewed by UK credit and legal for 
access.  Please could you liaise with the relevant legal and credit people in 
Houston to review this counterparty for the US LPG products.

Tracy Wallace is very keen to have this completed as soon as possible 
especially as this company is able to trade US LPG offline.

Many thanks

Anna

Can you track this down and let me know if there are any problems. Trafigura 
does OTC transactions with the US w/out problems. 
Thanks,
Tracy

Good Afternoon Tracy / 

Chris + I are unable to execute US LPG trades on the ENRON_ONLINE system. 
Apparently our administrator (Darren Jenkins) only has "read" options for us.

Please could you give the access to trade the US LPG. 

thanks, 
P.
