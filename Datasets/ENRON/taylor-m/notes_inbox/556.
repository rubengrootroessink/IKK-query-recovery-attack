Attached is a revised LOI and Term Sheet.  A redlined version of the LOI is 
attached, but the redlining function does not work on the term sheet (which 
was constructed with the "Tables" function).  The sections of the term sheet 
that changed are those entitled "Posting Agreement", "Transfer Rights", and 
"Registration Rights."  Please call me at X31575 with any comments or 
questions.
