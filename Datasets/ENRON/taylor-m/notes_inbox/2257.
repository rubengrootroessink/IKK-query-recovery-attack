Mark, is this the type of agreement that you would handle in your group?  It 
covers a joint research arrangement and addresses intellectual property 
issues, copyrights, patent, licensing and other issues that independently I 
would have approached you on.  
Regards,
Brent

Hi Brent,

In the near future it is possible that we may collaborate with groups within 
NOAA on research projects.  Before doing so though, there is
a number of legal matters to discuss, however.  I have just received the 
standard government legal form which they use and will likely 
insist upon using in their relations with ENRON. 

I am sending you a copy of this document...the CRADA...and would like for you 
to look it over in the next several days.  Please let me know
when you have comments.

Thanks for your help.

Regards,
Todd Kimberlain
