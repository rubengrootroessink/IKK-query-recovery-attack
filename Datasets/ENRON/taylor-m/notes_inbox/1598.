Scott et al - more info. from Felipe Foy as mentioned in my last email.

Also, as I mentioned to Justin yesterday, we have taken the precaution of 
registering the following four domain names for Enron Metals (for possible 
use, until we 'retrieve' enronmetals.com and enronmetals.co.uk from Peter 
Quine. This was also done to preclude further cybersquatting):

enron-metals.com   
enron-metals.co.uk
enronmetals.net
enronmetals.org

(Also, FYI to internal folks, note that Felipe Foy's team in London  is now 
co-ordinating registration of all domain names Enron-wide to ensure 
consistency and central tracking. We are trying to ensure that prior to any 
new domain name registrations by Enron that we first talk to Legal and Tax to 
ensure there are no trademark infringement issues or tax liability issues 
(particular for foreign jurisdiction registrations, e.g. registering 
enrononline.de for Germany).  

Please let me know if you require further information or have any concerns 
with any of this.

Thank you,

Paul Goddard

Justin,

I sent a cease and desist letter to Mr. Peter Quine when I first heard of
this matter.  He was given until last Friday to respond to me regarding the
matter.  I have not heard from him and the next step is to initiate an
arbitration proceeding in the US as to the enronmetals.com domain name.
This procedure is relatively inexpensive and swift, in that we should expect
a ruling within 60 days of filing.  To help me establish the needed showing
of bad faith on the part of Mr. Quine, could you please send me an e-mail
with all the relevants facts regarding the cybersquatting of the domain
name.  Unfortunately, there is not a similar proceeding available for the
enronmetals.com.uk domain name.  That domain name will involve a legal
proceeding in the UK, and I believe it could be quite lengthy.  My initial
thought was to proceed with the arbitration proceeding in the US first, and
then deal with .com.uk domain name laterm if necessary.

Please let me know if you wish for me to proceed in a different manner.

  Re: Enron Corp.

Dear Mr. Quine:

 Reference is made to your letter of 7 August 2000.  I appreciate
your reassurance that it was not your intention to infringe my client's
trade names and intellectual property rights.  Correspondingly, let me say
that I am very aware of all the legal aspects of domain name registration,
having worked in this area for quite some time, and I can assure you that
the intentional registration of a domain name that includes the trade name
or trademark of a third party is an infringement of the rights of such third
party.  There has been a great deal of litigation in the United States, and
I suspect in many other countries as well, regarding such wrongful
activities.  I am confident that your independent investigations in such
matters will support my comments.

 As I mentioned above, I appreciate the reassurance stated in your
letter and my initial letter was not intended to reflect upon your
reputation or integrity or method of doing business.  However, my client has
authorized me to take any and all action necessary to quickly secure the
enronmetals.com and enronmetals.com.uk domain names.  Consequently, please
send me a return e-mail stating whether or not you intend to promptly
transfer those domain names to Enron Corp.

       Very truly yours,

                 /wsb/

Justin,

To update you on the enronmetals domain name matter, attached please find a
copy of a fax I received from Peter Quine and my responsive e-mail to him.
Since Mr. Quine has not responded back to me, we will proceed with the
arbitration proceeding.  In that regard, could you please provide with me a
brief summary of the relevant facts so that we may prepare the necessary
arbitration pleadings.

thanks,

scott

Justin,

I sent a cease and desist letter to Mr. Peter Quine when I first heard of
this matter.  He was given until last Friday to respond to me regarding the
matter.  I have not heard from him and the next step is to initiate an
arbitration proceeding in the US as to the enronmetals.com domain name.
This procedure is relatively inexpensive and swift, in that we should expect
a ruling within 60 days of filing.  To help me establish the needed showing
of bad faith on the part of Mr. Quine, could you please send me an e-mail
with all the relevants facts regarding the cybersquatting of the domain
name.  Unfortunately, there is not a similar proceeding available for the
enronmetals.com.uk domain name.  That domain name will involve a legal
proceeding in the UK, and I believe it could be quite lengthy.  My initial
thought was to proceed with the arbitration proceeding in the US first, and
then deal with .com.uk domain name laterm if necessary.

Please let me know if you wish for me to proceed in a different manner.

scott

Mark,

Would be grateful if you could update me and Barry as to the status of the

  Re: Enron Corp.

Dear Mr. Quine:

 Reference is made to your letter of 7 August 2000.  I appreciate
your reassurance that it was not your intention to infringe my client's
trade names and intellectual property rights.  Correspondingly, let me say
that I am very aware of all the legal aspects of domain name registration,
having worked in this area for quite some time, and I can assure you that
the intentional registration of a domain name that includes the trade name
or trademark of a third party is an infringement of the rights of such third
party.  There has been a great deal of litigation in the United States, and
I suspect in many other countries as well, regarding such wrongful
activities.  I am confident that your independent investigations in such
matters will support my comments.

 As I mentioned above, I appreciate the reassurance stated in your
letter and my initial letter was not intended to reflect upon your
reputation or integrity or method of doing business.  However, my client has
authorized me to take any and all action necessary to quickly secure the
enronmetals.com and enronmetals.com.uk domain names.  Consequently, please
send me a return e-mail stating whether or not you intend to promptly
transfer those domain names to Enron Corp.

       Very truly yours,

                 /wsb/

       W. Scott Brown
