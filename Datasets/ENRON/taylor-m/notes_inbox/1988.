Scott -

In the DocSwapLogic we probably need to add in the ability to do online 
negotiations and signing.  This is contemplated but not part of the current 
development only because of the anticipated launch date of July 17.  Let me 
know what you think.

Also, we need to move forward with BankLogic.

Also, I spoke to Mark Taylor earlier in the week about the status of "EOL" as 
a shorthand means of referring to EnronOnline.  I had understood that there 
was a move being made to obtain this mark or to register this so that we 
could use it.  In speaking with Mark Holsworth, I understand you may have 
some insight into the status.  If so, please let me know.  If not, we need to 
look into moving forward with this also.

Thanks.

Mark,

It should be no problem in getting a registration for ENRONONLINE REAL TIME
QUOTES.  However, it is a near certainty that we will be required to
disclaim any right to "real time quotes" apart from the mark as a whole.  If
you give me a description of the goods and/or services, I can go ahead and
file the application.

In regard to DOCSWAPLOGIC, please let me know if the following description
of services is acceptable:

"Online transaction-support services to provide secure document storage,
retrieval and sharing"

As you can see from the marks and descriptions below, I have tried to be
consistent with the other "Logic" related marks.

ADMINLOGIC  "Online transaction-support services to control user access to
online trading platform"

CONFIRMLOGIC  "Online transaction-support services to confirm physical and
financial trades"

NOMLOGIC  "Online transaction-support services to validate trades and
exchange nomination data"

INVOICELOGIC  "Online transaction-support services to provide automated
invoice reconciliation"

Please see the below on DocuSwapLogic.

Also, I need to see if we can work on trademarking "EnronOnline Real Time
Quotes"

Thanks.

Mark,

Attached is a draft marketing slick to use when obtaining the trademark.
We'll have a final marketing slick by the end of the month.

Let me know if you need more information.

Thanks,
Kristin
