    OR  
Well, which one is it?  You want to share some information with the rest of 
Enron, but you don't know whether it belongs in the ThinkBank or in eMeet.  
Here is a handy quiz to help you make the decision.  Answers appear just 
below the quiz.  
What kind of information do you want to share?
A.  A well-developed idea or suggestion for something that will affect 
Enron's bottom line, either through revenue or savings.
B.  A question or a statement that you want someone else at Enron to answer 
or discuss.
C.  None of the above.
D.  Both A and B.
If you chose "A," deposit an idea in the ThinkBank's Idea Vault.  If you 
chose "B," eMeet is the place for you.  If you chose "C" or "D," send an 
e-mail to ethink@enron.com and let us know what you're trying to share.  
We'll help you find the right place for it in eThink.
