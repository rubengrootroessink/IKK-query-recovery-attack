Mark,
Enclosed is the redlined version of our General Terms, as well as the final
Agreement Jason Peters agreed to.  As the earlier e-mail states, we developed
our "Counterparty Management" program to satisfy concerns ENA voiced
regarding credit and customization of future customers of Enron North America.

After reviewing the attached documents you should find everything in order
for ENA to execute and return the General Terms Agreements.

I am available at your earliest convenience to discuss any questions
regarding the afore mentioned.  Thank you for your time in reviewing these
documents.

Sincerely,

Jeffery C. Lowney
Vice President
