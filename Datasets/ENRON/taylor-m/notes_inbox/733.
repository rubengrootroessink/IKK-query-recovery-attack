I think that you are absolutely correct in the assessment of the quantity 
description, but this is the language that we use in all the Physical 
Products and I would prefer not to change it - for the same reason that we 
are making the Index and Loadshape language 'match' both Physical and 
Financial Products, I don't want to change something that's already being 
used extensively in the Physical Products. 

However, Mark Taylor and I do suggest that we clarify how the Notional 
Quantity is derived - which I think helps solve the issue; please see the 
attached mark-up.



Sara - please call me ASAP on this.

Dale

Attached please find my revisions to the power financial swap product.  
Please review and let me know if you have any questions or comments.  A 
number of the changes I made are necessary to ensure that the product 
components for the swap are compatible with the physical index product 
components, e.g, the description of the index.

Regards,

Leslie

holidays.

Leslie and Mark; once I get comments from commercial I'd like to have each of
