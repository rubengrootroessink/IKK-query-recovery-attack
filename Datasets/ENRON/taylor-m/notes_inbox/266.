Louise -

I haven't received a response to my e-mail of last week indicating I was
coming to London and would welcome the opportunity to finally meet
face-to-face. If you are available and interested,  please let me know
as I am definitely interested (if, for no other reason, then to put a
face to a name and voice).

On another topic,  I recently found out that we briefly displayed a
slide at a conference that had the Enron logo on it.  I was told we did
not verbally state the company name. I went ballistic! I've made sure we
talked with the conference organizers to make sure that none of the
offending material is distributed to the conference participants. I
deeply regret that the incident occurred.

Again, I would still like to get together and, if you wish, promise to
keep it purely social with no business discussions. The offer is there.
Let me know.

Sincerely,
Dave
