Hey Mark -- What is your address?  I am starting to get pix back and I want
to send some along.  I am sure you are back in your routine and a long way
from the Bitter End but hopefully these pictures will remind you of paradise
a little.  Send along your address when you get a moment.

Bill.

P.S.  Amanda is now in her first week of bar review.  The whining is just
beginning but I am sure it will hit a crescendo by mid July.  I'll keep you
posted.
