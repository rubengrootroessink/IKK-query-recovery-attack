We thought of you last night when we took the Russian Teacake cookies from
Christmas out of the freezer and finished them.  Yum,yum.

I'm sending this from work because our computer at home is down.  The study
is empty.  We had the carpet shampooed yesterday and the new furniture is
supposed to be delivered next Tuesday.  We may put a card table in there
tomorrow so we can connect the computer again.  That is the only room, other
than the kitchen, that has a handy phone connection for the modem.  There is
one in the bedroom but it is behind the dresser!  I'm surprised at home much
I miss it.

I noticed in the WSJ this morning that Enron is going to have some
competition in on-line trading.  I'll be interested to see if the price is
affected today.  See, that is a good reason to connect that computer
tonight!

Love, Mother
