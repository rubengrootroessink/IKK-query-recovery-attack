Mark,

In the context of our aim to introduce (physically-settled) base metals via 
EOL, I have reviewed MG's existing customer base.  There are a small number 
of counterparties from jurisdictions that have not been reviewed from here 
and I'd be grateful if you could let me know whether these have been reviewed 
by you , and also whether any of these jurisdictions are "restricted"  from a 
US perspective.  Many thanks.
