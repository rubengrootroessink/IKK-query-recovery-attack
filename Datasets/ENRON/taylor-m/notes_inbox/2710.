Craig:

Hope you had a Happy New Year.

Marcus is out this week.

I have not been in the loop recently regarding the clearing issues. I know 
that Mary Cook of our Legal Department here in Houston had looked into the 
issues with some of the Operations people working under John Lavaroto. I do 
not know what the conclusions, if any, were as a result of that work.

I think Limor Nissan, our new Senior Counsel in NY, should now be involved in 
this, and should coordinate with Mary once Limor gets a read from you on 
where you are going with this.  Also, I got a voice mail from Paul Pantano of 
McDermott, Will & Emery today, and he indicated that you would like him to do 
some work. Craig, in order for us to effectively manage legal issues, Limor 
needs to be involved in all requests made for outside legal work. Please 
coordinate with her. 

Let me know if you need any further assistance. Thanks.

Regards, Alan
