Dave,

Everyone of these countries is important to physical and financial trading.  
Ranking the countries 

Chile - number one copper producing country in the world
China - very big consumer/trader/producer in copper, ally, zinc etc
Peru - very large producer of copper, lead, zinc precious
Brazil - large producer/consumer
Korea - very large consumer of all metals

To me it is an issue of time for all of these countries.

regards,
bruce

Edmund: Mexico is already underway.

Bruce: Can you comment on the relative importance of the following countries 
to MG's business? It costs us about GBP 15,000 to add each country (due 
diligence and document preparation costs). I may also be able to add a 
comment on Korea by tomorrow.

Chile
Brazil
Peru
Korea
Republic of China

Subject: Metals due diligence

Dear Jonathan,

Following our earlier telephone conversation, here is the list of countries 
for which we need to undertake follow-up commodity due diligence for trading 
physical metals products.  As the initial two products to be offered are 
aluminium and copper we should restrict the due diligence to base metals 
only.  In addition, let's ask for the position on cash-settled derivatives - 
should involve only a follow-up question asking whether previous advice for 
energy commodity derivatives changes in respect of derivatives on metals.  
However, the initial focus should be on the physical trading questions. 

Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, 
Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, Slovenia, 
Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom

Also, there is the following list of countries, for which there is currently 
EOL access documentation which will need to have the same review.  
Mark - do you want us to handle the due diligence over here, or do you want 
to run with it?

Australia
Canada
Japan
United States

There is a third list of countries for which we currently do not have EOL 
access documentation.  
Dave/Amita/Mark - Are we going to proceed with preparing such access 
documentation for these countries?

Chile
Brazil
Peru
Mexico
Korea
Republic of China

Regards, 

Edmund
