Mark - Europe made the following change on their EnronOnline confirmations to 
eliminate the need to send a GTC with each confirmation (see below note from 
Justin Boyd).   Can we institute the following here?  

Thanks!
Sheri

Amita,

Justin has agreed that it would be OK to stop sending GTC's with confirms and 
instead include the following language on the confirms for EnronOnline 
transactions which are governed under GTC (not governed by Master Agreements):

"This Transaction is governed by the EnronOnline General Terms and Conditions 
(GTC) that you have accepted via EnronOnline. For a copy of this GTC, please 
click on the Product Description on the EnronOnline website and choose "View 
GTC".

Justin: Please verify that I have the language correct as per our discussion.

Thanks,

Dave
