Hi Anne,
I work in origination for ENW & have a question that I don't know who to 
ask...  There is an on-line SEC governance around alternative trading systems 
(ATS) that I'd like to discuss with someone, in legal, who may have 
researched this.

Can you please provide guidance or a contact?
Thank you,
Kara Knop
