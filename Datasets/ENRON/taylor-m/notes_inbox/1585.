Al:

Per my voice mail, I have left a message for Mark to give his input.

I think you should revise the letter as follows, subject to Mark's edits:

"Please be advised that effective July 17, 2000, MGplc was aquired by the 
Enron group. MG London Inc was part of the MGplc group.

Effective October 9, 2000, MG London Inc. changed its name to "Enron Trading 
Services Inc". 

Also, please be advised that the Financial Status of MG London Inc (now Enron 
Trading Services Inc.) has not changed. 

If there are any questions please call me at 212 715 5845."
