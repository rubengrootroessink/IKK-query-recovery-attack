On Monday, July 10th, I have two attorneys starting w/ ENA Legal Department.  
Marcus Nettleton is transferring from EBS and Robert Bruce is from an outside 
firm.  Can we please get the computer equipment set up for these two 
gentlemen on Monday afternoon?  The cubes they are moving into will be 
constructed on Friday 7/7/00, and completed by Monday 7/10/00.

Thanks.
