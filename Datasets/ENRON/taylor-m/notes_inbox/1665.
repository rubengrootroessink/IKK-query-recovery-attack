We are currently in discussions with 3-4 brokers (including GFI in London) to 
allow them to transact on behalf of their customers via EnronOnline.  Mark 
Taylor suggested that I send you some information on the broker client 
application and the process flow.  Attached please find the functional 
specifications for the broker client and a draft process flow.  All documents 
are work in progress.

We have been discussing this with Amita Gosalia (EnronOnline Product 
Control), Debbie Nichols and Gail Hill in the London Office.

Please call me with any question at 713 853-0397.  I will continue to 
coordinate my legal questions through Mark Taylor.
