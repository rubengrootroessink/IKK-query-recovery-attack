Mark:

Below are some changes I would like to propose we make to our form of Maste=
r=20
that we send to Mexican counterparties.

The issue is what documents do we request of Mexican counterparties in orde=
r=20
to receive assurances of appropriate corporate authority for the execution=
=20
and delivery of the Master.  Below is the current language and my proposal.=
 =20

Current
A Certificate certifying (a) resolutions of Party B=01,s and its Credit Sup=
port=20
Provider=01,s (if any) board of directors (or other governing body) authori=
zing=20
this Agreement and the Transactions contemplated hereby (or the Credit=20
Support Document, as the case may be) and (b) copies of Party B=01,s and it=
s=20
Credit Support Provider=01,s (if any) articles of incorporation and bylaws =
(or=20
other constituent documents)
A certified copy of a Power of Attorney authorizing a specified person or=
=20
persons to execute and deliver on its behalf this Agreement (or the Credit=
=20
Support Document, as the case may be)


Proposal:

A) Copies of Party B's and its Credit Support Provider's (if any) articles =
of=20
incorporation and bylaws, as amended from time to time (escritura=20
constitutiva y estatutos sociales vigentes) and, if required under Party B'=
s=20
bylaws and its Credit Support Provider (if any) or, if otherwise available,=
=20
copies of the minutes of the meetings of the board of directors (or other=
=20
governing body)  of Party B and its Credit Support Provider (if any)=20
authorizing this Agreement and the Transactions contemplated hereby.

B) certified copy of a Power of Attorney granting a specified person or=20
persons with sufficient powers and authority to execute and deliver this=20
Agreement on its behalf (or the Credit Support Document, as the case may=20
be). =20

As you may know, most of our Mexican counterparties do not really pay=20
attention to what they are signing.  The result is that, in most cases, the=
y=20
agree to provide certain evidence of authority that they really do not have=
=20
(for example, in Mexico, officer certificates are not usual and they do not=
=20
really mean much).  At the end of the day we receive executed Masters and a=
ll=20
corporate documents that are required under Mexican law to adequately prove=
=20
corporate authority but we are not receiving what the counterparty agreed t=
o=20
provide in the Master (again they agreed to this because they do not read i=
t=20
carefully).  I checked with our Mexican counsel both the issue and the=20
proposed language and he agreed with both.=20

The other issue is to add a paragraph in the form of legal opinion we reque=
st=20
from counsel to our Mexican counterparty, limiting the legal opinion to the=
=20
laws of Mexico.  The idea is to avoid wasting time with a change we=20
necessarily must agree with and most importantly, end up with a legal opini=
on=20
that "looks" more like a US opinion.  Language proposed: "The opinions here=
in=20
expressed and statements herein made are limited in all respects to the law=
s=20
of Mexico"

Finally, as I previously told you, I personally have no problems about=20
receiving legal opinions from in-house counsel.  Are you okay with this wit=
h=20
respect to Mexican counterparties?

I will prepare subordination language for the intercompany debt and will se=
nd=20
it to you tomorrow.

Thanks
