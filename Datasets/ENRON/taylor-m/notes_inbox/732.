Attached please find my revisions to the power financial swap product.  
Please review and let me know if you have any questions or comments.  A 
number of the changes I made are necessary to ensure that the product 
components for the swap are compatible with the physical index product 
components, e.g, the description of the index.

Regards,

Leslie
