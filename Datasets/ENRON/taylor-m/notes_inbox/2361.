It has come to my attention that with respect to ISDA masters we file as 
follows:

1.  Original documents for ISDA and any ongoing legal activity, such as 
assignments etc., are directed to Global Contracts.

2.  A Blue file with copies of item 1 is retained in our files.

3.  A hardback green file is then made (a copy of Blue file) and sent to Kay 
Young to be maintained in legal files.

Items 2 and 3 are duplicative copies and require duplicative ongoing upkeep 
with respect to assignments, mergers, name changes etc.  Panus, Jones and I 
are to discuss this soon.  I think we should cease doing item 3 as it is 
duplicative and "making work."  I might also suggest that all prior green 
files on ISDAs in the file room be destroyed.  It may have served a purpose 
at one time, but I cannot see it now.  I will discuss this with Tana before 
making a decision.   What are your thoughts/approval?  Thanks.  Mary
