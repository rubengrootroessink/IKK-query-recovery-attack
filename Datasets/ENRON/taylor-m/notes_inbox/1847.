Mark,
could you prepare an omnibus agreement for us to use with Huntco for this 
transaction? As you know, our credit group has approved this transaction 
without credit language in the agreement. Thanks for your help.

Subject: Huntco Swap Information

Paul,
thanks again for working with us on Huntco. Could you evaluate the exposure 
related to Enron offering a floating for fixed swap to Huntco. 

Quantity:  17,400 tons/month
Term:  3 months
Start:  January 2001
End:  March 2001
Settlement: Monthly
Price:  $237/ton

Enron will pay Huntco $237/month.
Huntco will pay Enron the Purchasing Magazine index price.
Note that if steel prices continue to decline then Huntco is in the money 
with this swap.

If the credit exposure related to this looks reasonable to you, we will 
prepare an Omnibus agreement for this specific transaction. Please call me if 
you have any questions.
--Andrew
