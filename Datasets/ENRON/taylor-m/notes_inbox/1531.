Mark, have you had a chance to look at this?  I think it is fine but would 
like you or someone in your group dealing with EOL sign off as well.

Thanks

Greg

Mark, please see the note from Dianne below.  I will review the index 
description for accuracy but I think someone in your group needs to review 
the overall language for final sign-off before it goes live on EnronOnline.  
Whoever is looking at the language can communicate directly with Dianne on 
any concerns/changes.

Thanks

Greg

Greg,

Attached is the product detail we will be sending to Houston so that they can 
create a new EOL power product for us.  Can you let me know if everything 
looks okay.



Thanks!

Dianne
