Brent,
From an EnronOnline perspective we would not have a problem if we delete the 
last paragraph, since ETA and PA reference to the GTC applies to all products 
and not only to weather:
"Furthermore, any reference to the "General Terms and Conditions" in the 
Electronic Trading Agreement or the Password Application between the 
undersigned shall be deemed a reference to the Deemed ISDA".
Pls. let me know if you have any questions/comments
Thanks
Carlos

As far as I am concerned this works for me.  Is there any problem with them
signing and getting set up on EOL today?  Carl or Lisa, please call me at
home at 281 866 8797.
Thanks,
Brent
