Wayne,

In order for us to roll out the new coal product and the amended GTC, we will 
need to send customers a letter notifying them that the GTC has changed, 
which identifies all of the changes between this version and the version 
which is Online.

Could you please draft a letter which outlines the changes? We will 
incorporate this into a mailout to all customers who have traded coal, 
informing them of the change in the GTC.

Thanks,

Dave

Subject: EOL New Coal Product

Dale and Dave,

The Coal Group wants to add a new product, CSX Compliance, to EOL.  I have 
reviewed and approved the attached short and long descriptions as well as 
changes to our online GTC's.  The changes to the GTC's also reflect the 
earlier changes we sent you but which were not implemented.  With this 
revision, we will need only one set of GTC's applicable to Coal Products. 
Please advise if you need anything additional.



Wayne
