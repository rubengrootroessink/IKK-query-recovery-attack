Here is the ISDA Schedule that I believe was sent to Metals last week.  I'm 
alos attaching the latest draft of the Webco confirm which may be a good 
starting point for this deal although I understand that there will be special 
provisions (i.e., the discount) that will need to be incorporated and we will 
need to switch the Fixed and Floating Payors.
