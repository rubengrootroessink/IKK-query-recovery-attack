I am in the process of setting up two new products  to be traded on 
EnronOnline. The two products are Heating Oil Option products and the draft 
of the Long Descriptions are attached. If you have any issues concerning 
these products please let me know. I will keep you all updated on any revised 
versions,
Thanks
