The Global Gas Pipeline group is looking to trade gas transportation on 
EnronOnline.  The Initial products are expected to be day ahead and rest of 
the month transportation. Houston PipeLine and Northern Natural Gas Pipeline 
will be the initial pipelines posting bids and offers. The expected date of 
launch  is 8/23/00. We do not have the GTC or Product descriptions yet.  I 
will forward those to you'll as soon as I have them. In the meantime if 
you'll could please let me know if there are any legal, credit , tax, risk, 
and other concerns we should be addressing. Thanks a lot.
