Mark here is my markup to the survey.  I tried to be more specific in a few 
areas to adjust it to what is likely to happen in Argentina.  Let me know if 
you have any comments.  

Lynn we could use some help on drafting the tax questions in Section 9 to 
more specifically handle the unique tax situation in Argentina.  

Thanks.
