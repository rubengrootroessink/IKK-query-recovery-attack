Bill and Rod,

You may have heard that Enron South America is planning to launch Enron On 
Line in Brazil and Argentina in a few months from now (target is beg. Q3).  
Please find attached a presentation that shows our state of mind for Brazil.  
On power trading, we've followed Louise Kitchen's advice to try to get credit 
lines pre-approved for 15 to 20 of the biggest, most sophiticasted and most 
likely counter-parties of Enron.  I'll bring the financial statements of 
these companies with me to Houston, as I'm traveling to the US this WE, and 
will hand deliver them beginning of next week.  I'll be happy to chat with 
you as well and see if there is a way to make your job easier and facilitate 
communications between our groups in the future.

Cheers,

Remi Collonges
Ricardo Lisboa

Subject: Credit Summary

Remi,
This is the summary of the Financial Statements of 18 out of the 20 clients 
we would like to have credit to pre-approve.
There are 2 companies that still didn't publish 1999 end Statements. They 
should be publishing soon.
If you think it is necessary you can tell them that I can help to understand 
some other items of all the printed information you are taking with you.

Thanks
Ricardo
