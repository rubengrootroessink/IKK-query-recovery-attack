Hi Mark,

I was just wondering if you had had the time 

To think about  the issues we need to address if we were to have a draft 
agreement  with the Houston Chronicle on us posting prices in the Houston 
Chronicle. The last we talked about it you were going to put some basic ideas 
together in an email and send it to Louise and myself. 
To see whether there would be any issues if we offered transaction ID's to 
brokers. Can we offer them selectively  Can we charge them for it ?


I know you are really busy  but Louise would like us to move forward with 
this and I was hoping to get something back from you on this soon. Thanks.

Savita
