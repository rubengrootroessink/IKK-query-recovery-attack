Mark,

Considering that we are using US law, can I assume that the Japanese clients 
will use US PA's and ETA's?

If not, could you please send us the appropriate contracts?

Thanks in advance,

Mark

How are things going?
I just wanted to make 2 requests:

* Could I have your notes re: legal FAQ ASAP
*  I have a copy of the PA from the EOL site. If there were any revisions 
made to it in order to customize for the Japanese launch, could you please 
send me an electronic copy

Thanks
Rousseau
