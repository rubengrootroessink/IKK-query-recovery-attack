Mark,
 Supper on Thursday sounds great.   We can plan to eat right after
your meetings end.  I will get tickets for the play Thursday night if you
are interested (I still go to all the plays - If you're not interested, I'll
just go on Sunday).  I'm looking forward to getting together again (I can
show you our new NMR).
 If I can do a little campaigning - don't repeat what I say here, I
don't want to get in any trouble.  I'm enclosing the brief notes from a
science building meeting last fall about the campaign.  We hope the campaign
isn't just about bricks and mortar.  It would be a great opportunity to
strengthen the sciences.  #'s 1, 2 and 3 below were particularly important
to many people.  #1 is getting scholarship money to attract good students
into the sciences.  #2 is endowment for equipment (we have a growing
endowment in chemistry and biology - I'll tell you about it when you are
here).  It is just that science has become very expensive and we would like
for this endowment to grow.  #3 is just to look at remodeling the science
building - chemistry doesn't need this as much as biology and psychology.  I
don't want you to push for these particular things - they would know you had
been lobbied!!  It is just that I hope there will be some attempt to
strengthen academics in the campaign - I'm also aware that some of our
requests may not be the most fundable items.  It is always easier to raise
big money on bricks and mortar.
 See you soon,  I'm off to class.
       Doc

Science Building Meeting
August 27, 1999

Present: Biology,  Chemistry,  Computer,  Math,  Psych and  Physics  faculty

Ideas presented for funding possibilities in the upcoming campaign that
would benefit the academic programs offered in H-T Science Building:

 1. Presidential scholars
  To maintaining a steady stream of very good students in
            science and math classes.
  Many faculty thought this was very important!

 2. Endowment for equipment and computers
  Build the endowment for science equipment and computers to
            help maintain a
  constant and enhanced  supply of money to buy equipment and
            computers.

 3. Remodeling H-T science building
  Air condition some labs and lecture rooms.
  Remodel laboratory space for present needs of our programs.
            (look at whole building).

 4. Endowment for Faculty salaries

 5. Endowment for student research

 6. Endowment for summer programs

 7. Endowment for travel funds

 8. Endowment for named lecturers

 9. Staffing concerns
  Possibility of endowed chairs,  lab technician  and/or
            equipment repair technician.

  We know the lab and equipment repair people are on-going
            expenses, but maybe money
   could be raised to endow them.

These are the ideas that were suggested at our meeting.   Different faculty
would have different priorities within this list.   We all agreed it is
extremely important to raise some endowment funds in the next campaign for
the direct benefit of the programs offered in H-T.
