To Jae- Moo,=20
1. Impressive P'point presentation indeed.

2. Friday Sep 1 - 800am TYO time is good for Australia, I will be attending
is there anything that i need to arrange at our end ??

3. After the successful roll-out of W for Japan & Oz thus qtr,=20
as discussed - we are ready to roll-out Korean W say in Mid October ???
Your email & presenatation thus arrived at a very good time.

4. Just some questions -
You may answer in the conference call or by email -- your choice=20

(a) why has W derivatives been singled out by FSC for potential review=20
when there is no regulation of eg LPG , or plastics swaps & fwds  ?  (pg 11=
=20
of presentation)

(b) How necessary are the meetings with ( pg 5 of presentation)
".. Bank of Korea (BOK)/ Ministry of Finance & Economy (MOFE) for=20
classification of weather derivatives as commodity derivatives.." ?
Is this meeting to meet
"...except for Foreign Exchange Transaction Regulations (FETR) in case of=
=20
foreign currency trades
? Classification of weather derivatives as commodity or financial derivativ=
es=20
under FETR needs to be resolved..."(pg 15 of presentation)

Can we just do it first with Enron Korea as the counterparty ? If so , if=
=20
Korean coy transacts with Enron Korea,
there should be no problem in remitting funds wholly within Korea !
Also we intend to offer product in Won only so no FX involved at all .

(c)=20
pg 18 of presentation=20
'...All other EnronOnline products with the exception of bandwidth and=20
emission allowances are classified as commodity derivatives in Korea..."
Why is it bandwidth and emission are classified differently?
Will not Weather fall under same category ?

"...Commodity derivatives require a prior reporting to the Bank of Korea fo=
r=20
each trade .."
Is this only relevant if product is not in Won but foreign currency ?


5. pg 28 of presentation=20
Note that Dr Christian Werner - Sydney office will be the person for=20
"Data system =01  For weather derivative products, arrange with a weather=
=20
forecasting company for the weather data feed - timing depends on the=20
location"

We will be able to assist with (if reqd, see points 4b & c above)
"...=01  For weather derivatives, arrange presentation meetings with BOK/MO=
FE=20
for classification of weather derivatives as commodity derivatives
_ May require longer time for their decision making =20
Korea Office, Mike Dahlke, EOL Weather specialist (?)"


Best wishes

Jae-Moo

On the section of Regulatory/Legal Environment, it may be useful to note:

1. There is no official rule or regulation that ex post facto reporting for=
=20
Commodity Derivatives are acceptable to the Bank of Korea, although your an=
d=20
Korean external lawyer's (Kim & Chang) informal verbal enquiries with the=
=20
Bank of Korea have suggested they have accepted some  7 or 8 reports since=
=20
April last year (all from Hyundai Oil).

2. The Bank of Korea take up to two weeks to review the reports and, as Kim=
 &=20
Chang has advised, there remains a possibility that the Bank of Korea may=
=20
reject the report, although they were not able to advise the grounds on whi=
ch=20
a report may be rejected.

3. Although, a foreign counterparty need not file a report or seek approval=
,=20
the Korean counterparty must still do so for the benefit and interest of th=
e=20
foreign counterparty. Kim & Chang advised that where reporting or approval =
is=20
required but is not made or obtained, the Korean counterparty would not be=
=20
able to remit its payments under the transaction. This would clearly impact=
=20
on the settlement of the transaction, in particular shorter term deals sinc=
e=20
reporting and approval may take several weeks.=20

4. The Supreme Court of Korea has ruled that a foreign exchange authorizati=
on=20
that was originally required should be obtained in order for a foreign part=
y=20
to execute any judgment against the Korean party and remit the proceeds.=20

Matt

Subject: EOL Korea

As many of you are aware, over the past few months we have been investigati=
ng=20
whether or not it would make sense to seriously consider an EOL launch in=
=20
Korea from a market, regulatory and legal perspective.  The primary interes=
t=20
has been on reviewing whether or not we could launch existing products in=
=20
Korea (e.g., products already handled by Singapore EOL) as well as new=20
products (e.g., Seoul weather).=20

This initial work was directed primarily by the Korea team working within t=
he=20
APACHI group.  If a launch is to progress much further from this point,=20
however, substantial attention by the EOL team would be required.  To=20
facilitate this, the attached presentation summarizes our primary findings =
to=20
date and some of our thoughts.  We would appreciate your taking a look at t=
he=20
attached document.

We would like to arrange a conference call for next Thursday (Aug. 31st) at=
=20
6:00 pm by Houston time (Friday at 8:00 am by Tokyo time) to discuss the=20
attached document and to solicit thoughts as to next steps.  Please let me=
=20
know whether you will be able to join this call or, if you have a conflict,=
=20
an alternative time.  Your participation will be greatly appreciated. =20

Best regards,

Jae-Moo
