Subject: ClickPaper Process Flow diagrams

I don't know how much help you will find these, but I attach the process 
flows diagrams but I tried to get everyone's roles onto paper.  The main 
areas of note for me in having spent time looking at the process are (BIG 
CAVEAT is that I probably don't understand everything bearing in mind the 
small amount of time involved - so apologies first):

(i) The definitive legal framework is not yet available.  There appear to be 
too many documents to click on if you are the customer (ETA, Rules and GTC).  
The Master issue is also outstanding. Things like the Long Product 
Description which are fundamentally part of the contract process and their 
appearance is not clear to me on the website also the adding of new products 
is not subject to validation.  The easiest short term solution here is to 
make sure you do not post any products which are not available on EOL - 
therefore having gone through the process (see launching new products flow 
chart). 
(ii) The process is heavily dependent on the Ariba database and manual flows 
of information between all of the parties.  EOL has an automated email system 
which emails the notices around, making it less manual.  With the smaller 
number of players this is not a big risk but the people in ClickPaper Control 
will need to be high calibre in order to write up the procedures as they are 
implementing them.
(iii) The website currently is only available (I might be wrong but there is 
only one PA/ETA) to US customers.  



In case you don't have visio - here they are in PowerPoint.
