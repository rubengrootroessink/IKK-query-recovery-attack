Mark,

I work for Edward Ondarza as an originator in the Pulp and Paper group.  We 
are attempting to close a major asset financing transaction that required 
Enron to execute several swaptions with large buyers of paper packaging.  
Through this process, we signed on 5 new major counter-parties:

Quaker Oats (Shari)
Frito-Lay/Pepsi (Shari)
Ralcorp Holdings (Shari)
General Mills (Sara)
Kellogg's (Sara)

In addition, Sara helped negotiate a complex swaption with The Dial 
Corporation.  As we move to mid-year performance reviews, I wanted to cite 
these individuals for great work in helping us win new business.  Please let 
me know if you have any questions at ext. 30418.

Thanks.

Ed Quinn
