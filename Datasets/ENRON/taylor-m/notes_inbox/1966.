Mark -

Here is the latest version of the Annex for the Confirmation Central Module.  
There are some comments from Alan, Leslie and Jeff that I am waiting for so I 
have not updated the document since 11/27.

Let me know when would be a good time to discuss this, in light of the 
cancellation of the meeting later today.

Thanks.
