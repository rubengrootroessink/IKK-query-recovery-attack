Jeff:  When Jason Peters and I concluded negotiations of the Enron Provider
Agreement and the General Terms and Conditions (GTC), we had sent him the
Release of the new "Counter Party Management" System we coded and went live
on the site with to meet Enron's requirements.  He took several days in
having his people check it out operationally and he approved it.  We were
prepared with the following language to include at the end of Section 5 of
the GTC but was not asked for it so he never saw it.  You can use the
following at the end of Section 5 if Enron wants, but the System is
operational and in place as they requested.

"EnergyGateway will implement and maintain systems which allow User to
determine whether other users of the System are approved counter parties for
User to trade with.  User may modify its list of approved counter parties at
anytime".

Good luck in finalizing the GTC with Enron.  Please call me if I can help in
any way.
Thanks, Dan...
