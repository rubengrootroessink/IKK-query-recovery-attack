Dear Janette

Thanks for your help on the telephone today.
Back in Septemeber I introduced myself on email to these two gentlemen.
I am the Vice Chairman of our company and I have been working out of our 
small New York office since June of last year in an effort to generally raise 
our group profile in USA.
I have been with Lombard 10 years and have a 27 year background in 
international investment banking.
I can be reached by email:john.shield@lombardrisk.com or by telephone:212 372 
8709.

My Chairman John Wisbey founded the company in 1989 since which time we have 
established a reputation of excellence in financial systems, consultancy and 
training.
Today we do business with about 45 of the world's top 100 banks.
We are based in London with offices in New York and Hong Kong.
Mark Haedicke is an Isda board and we are members of Isda.

Our five business areas could be summarised as follows:
