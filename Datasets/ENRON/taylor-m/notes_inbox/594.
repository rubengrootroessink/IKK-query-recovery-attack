Subject: Bankruptcy Swaps with Canadian Reference Entities

The Houston desk has asked me to prepare a form of confirm for a credit 
derivative based on the bankruptcy of a Canadian reference entity.  Before I 
talk to Canadian counsel about the bankruptcy laws there I thought I should 
check with you guys and make sure you haven't done this already - any issues 
you know of?
Thanks, Mark
