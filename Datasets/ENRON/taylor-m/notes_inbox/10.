Ken

Further to my earlier voice-mail, I attach a copy of a Restricted List 
procedure we put together with the assistance of Slaughter and May.  The 
procedure has not yet been rolled out (since the then OTC product had not 
developed to a stage requiring implementation), but was intended to be sent 
to all business heads in Europe (ie desk heads, and staff at VP level and 
above, not just in trading). 

I hope you are able to assist us in putting together the procedures 
(including a form of consent letter) based on our discussion on Thursday and 
would be grateful if you could confirm.  

Many thanks and best regards

Paul
