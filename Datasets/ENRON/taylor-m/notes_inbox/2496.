Attached is the term sheet I have prepared for the Onondaga deal.  Please 
review and provide comments.  I would like to send it to Aquila by the end of 
today.

I will provide a copy to structuring.  They are going to reprice the deal as 
of today so that we have current values.

Ben:  You and I should talk this morning regarding the open pricing issues.  
Call me to discuss.

Fred
