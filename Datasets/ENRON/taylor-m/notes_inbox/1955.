Negotiations between the Treasury Department, the House Agriculture
Committee and Senator Gramm continue this evening.  The attached documents
reflect language sent to Senator Gramm from the Treasury Department this
morning.  The House Agriculture is waiting for a mark-up of the Treasury
language from Senator Gramm's office.

Congress is expected to finish its work this week. Negotiations on this
legislation will likely need to be completed in the next 24 hours if it is
to be included in a final package.

Additionally, Chairman Ewing spoke to Senator Gramm this morning urging
completion of negotiations.  Ewing also advised Gramm that he would be
forwarding a final legislative package to Speaker Hastert.

Please call me on 917-543-9622 if you have any questions or would like to
discuss further.
