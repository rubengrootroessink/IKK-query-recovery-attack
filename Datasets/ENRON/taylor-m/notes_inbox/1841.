Per your request,

This is a meeting with Mary Perkins and Marcus Pullicino in Treasury
to discuss MG integration issues which have risen.

I met with Mark Taylor in October with MG employees Craig Young and Al 
Pennisi.

I'll look forward to seeing Mark from 2-230 in EB2019 tomorrow, December 1.

Thanks
David
