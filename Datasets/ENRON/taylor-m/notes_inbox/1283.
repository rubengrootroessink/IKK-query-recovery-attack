Anne,

I have not done a hard read of the Schedule, but upon briefly reading, I 
noticed that in Part 4 (j), there is waiver of jury trial.  This is a very 
high policy issue for Enron Corp.  As a matter of Enron Corp. legal policy, 
Enron Corp. cannot agree to waiver of jury trial.  This policy is specific to 
Enron Corp. and may or may not   apply to the operating companies.  If there 
was an agreement to such a term, it would require approval by Mr. Derrick.  I 
can only recall one time that Mr. Derrick approved the waiver.  Also, in Part 
4(h), by virtue of the language, Enron Corp. agrees to jurisdiction in any 
court.  If jurisdiction is to be contractually agreed upon (and silence is 
not an option), the choices should be Texas (which in this case is probably 
not an option) or New York, with the specific courts being the United States 
District Court for the Southern District sitting in Manhattan or, if in state 
court, the Commercial Division of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, 
County of New York.  Let me know your thoughts.

Clement
