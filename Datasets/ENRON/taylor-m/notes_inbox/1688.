I think the broker is never really the counterpart and is introducing us to 
the customer, essentially the same as a voice trade. The structure you are 
referring to is more of a LME type deal. If you look the structure of voice 
broker trades this is really no different, except instead of a phone 
conversation, there is an electronically submitted transaction.
