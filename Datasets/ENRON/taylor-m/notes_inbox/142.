You should all have received a copy of Slaughter and May=01,s memorandum on=
 the=20
Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.  Unless we specifically decid=
e=20
otherwise in a particular case, my guess is that we should include wording =
to=20
contract out of the provisions of this Act in most if not all of our Englis=
h=20
Law contracts.  For ease, I attach a copy of the recommended wording.

If anyone wants to talk about this, please give me a call.

Thanks
Michael
