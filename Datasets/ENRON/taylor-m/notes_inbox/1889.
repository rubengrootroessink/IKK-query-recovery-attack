6. BUDGETING FOR A FAMILY VACATION
At the heart of every good vacation is knowing you're getting what
you've paid for. Somehow sipping a pi=0Fa colada on a lounge chair
while your kids frolic in the pool feels that much more relaxing-
and sweeter--knowing you've gotten a deal.

8. WHEN SIGHTSEEING ISN'T WHAT YOU EXPECTED
Sightseeing comes with a few psychological risks. Even when you
get to see the sights you seek, a small disappointed sigh may
drift through your head: Oh, so that's it, huh? That's how it is
in the real world, sure. But if travelers wanted reality, they'd
stay home. Here's a guide to making five famous attractions live
up to your unrealistic expectations.

9. ALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS IS...
So what genius was it exactly who thought that the best
reward for frequent travelers (frequent flyer miles) would
ultimately mean more travel? After 30 business trips this year,
the top of Julie Moline's holiday wish list is a less punishing
travel schedule--more like exercising frequent-staying-at-home
miles. And oh, yes, she wouldn't mind a few trinkets, gadgets, and
services that sooth tired, grumpy road warrior bodies and souls
while miraculously boosting productivity levels.
