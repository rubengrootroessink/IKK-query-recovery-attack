We have tentatively planned for two partners from the Chicago law firm of 
Sidley & Austin to come visit us in our offices on Friday, Aug. 11 and to 
give a presentation.  I say "tentatively" because I have not yet been able to 
confirm Mark Haedicke's availability on that date -- I will try to do that as 
soon as possible.

I would expect the presentation to take 1 to 2 hours -- I'm sure it could 
take longer if we wanted it to, i.e., if there turned out to be some matters 
that we wanted to discuss in further detail with them.  I think a morning 
meeting would suit most people's availability better than an afternoon one; 
please share your thoughts on this with me.

Enclosed is a rough outline of an agenda I have suggested to them for their 
presentation.  If there are other matters you would like to hear them 
discuss, I encourage you to let me know; I will pass all suggestions along to 
them.

As most of you probably know, attorneys have a duty of strict confidentiality 
to their clients, and this duty attaches from the moment a consultation 
begins (regardless of whether a formal "engagement" has commenced).  
Violation of this duty is grounds for disciplinary action by the governing 
bar association.   On the other hand, I realize that we do not have an 
established relationship with this firm or these lawyers.  All of that being 
said, I will leave it to each of you as to your comfort level in asking 
particular questions or sharing particular information.
