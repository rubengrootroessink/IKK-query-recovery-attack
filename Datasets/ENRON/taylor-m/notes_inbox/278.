Attached are copies of the ETA, PA and GTC which were attached to David 
Minns' email of Feb. 28.

David: Please let me know if this date (and therefore these copies) represent 
your final drafts.

Mark: Please let me know if you have any comments on the attached, or if you 
are happy to approve them as is.




I note that the GTC still needs a GST clause.

Thanks,

Dave
