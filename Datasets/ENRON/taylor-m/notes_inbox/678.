Edmund/Mark - I would be grateful if you could confirm that no Enron entity 
has a confidentiality agreement or fiduciary relationship with any of the 
listed entities below.  I would be grateful if you could revert at your 
earliest convenience as there is an initiative to quote prices on these names 
on the Euromoney website this week once as soon as approval is received.

Thanks & best regards,

Denis

Subject: additional names

We are in the process of selecting a large number of reference credits to be 
approved for display on the web site.  Our intention is to have 1000 names on 
line by the end of the quarter.  We are internally scrubbing the lists now 
and will forward them soon.  In the meantime, can we get approval to quote 
the following on line:

Transocean Sedco Forex Inc.
KPN N.V.
Deutsche Telekom
Technost International
Vivendi
Ryder Systems
Petrocanada

thanks
