Ohmygawd!  An e-mail message from Hal!  Now I know we really ARE in the
21st century.

I also get to Key West on the 24th and will be there until the 28th and
don't need a place to stay because I will be at the conference hotel.  Ted
will get there Friday eve.  I have meetings during the days Thursday &
Friday and Sat. morning; dinner on Friday is also a scheduled event for me.
Otherwise I don't think we have specific plans.  Looking forward to it!



Mark,
Me too...
Shall we plan to have dinner on Wednesday 24th or Thursday Jan 25th?
Perhaps we could also do something with Ted on Saturday afternoon (or
evening) which sounds open for you...
Hal
