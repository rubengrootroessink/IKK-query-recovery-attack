Yes!  We did receive the insurance information.  I'm sorry I didn't
acknowledge it right away.  Dad has made a chart for me from that booklet
that was included.  Thursday I started entering the info from the six
companies that I know about.  I'll let you know how it turns out.

Thank you for sending the Motley Fool article.  How exciting!  I have
some questions that further reveal my naivete regarding the whole
business.

1.  Does the term,  spot market mean the ability to transact business "on
the spot" so to speak, instead of delayed time?

2.  What is notional value?

3.  What is the information system the writer refers to which is used to
broker sales between suppliers and purchasers?
