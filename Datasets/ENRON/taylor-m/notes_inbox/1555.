Mark, it seems I am seeing an increased amount of requests from our trading 
desks to review assignments of existing swaps and other financial trades into 
Enron.  

Often, we are presented with an assignment document by a third party and 
asked to sign it on short notice; invariably, of course, because the trade is 
a pre-existing one, the confirmation document has been drafted by someone 
else.  More often than not, the documentation needs to be re-drafted or 
revised.

It seems like the following policy would save time for everyone -- anytime a 
third party asks us to take assignment of a trade, the trader should simply 
write up a deal ticket for the remaining portion of the trade that we want to 
assume, and we send the confirm out on our form (if we are "getting in 
between" two parties, the trader would write up two deal tickets 
simultaneously).  It would be up to the other parties to terminate their own 
trade. The trader should tell the counterparty that this would get them where 
they want to be faster, which is true (especially if ISDAs are in place; if 
they're not in place, we have to go through credit, omnibus process anyway).

If you think this would be a good idea, I could draft for your review a 
trader-friendly one-page memo encouraging this policy (I'm not naive enough 
to think that traders would read memos from the legal department, but we 
could give it a try) -- let me know what you think -- Bob
