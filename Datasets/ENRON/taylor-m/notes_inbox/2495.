Please consider the attached e-mail from your perspective as we consider the 
feasibility of forming a Canadian subsidiary of DealBench L.L.C., a Delaware 
limited liability company wholly-owned by Enron Net Works, LLC.  DealBench 
conducts an e-commerce business facilitating the conduct of transactions on 
the Internet through licensing arrangements.  Brenda Funk had suggested you 
as a starting point from the tax perspective which usually is the primary 
driver of these types of issues.  Let us know if we can provide additional 
information.  Thanks for your help.

Brenda, could you please investigate formation of a DealBench subsidiary 
formed under Canadian (Ontario) law?  Initial issues include limited 
liability status (form of entity), control (any necessity for Canadian 
ownership or representation in management?), repatriation, tax, timing, and 
cost of formation and maintenance.  At this point, we only are ascertaining 
feasibility.  Depending upon whether this seems practical, we should at some 
point involve appropriate ENA tax and accounting teams.  Let me know results 
of initial investigation and we can determine next steps.  If we need outside 
counsel input on Canadian issues, start with Bob Baird for direction.

Thanks, NJD

Yes -- the sub would have to set up to give the appearance that DealBench 
deals conducted for Canada are conducted by a Canadian company.

Thanks,
Ross

Would the sub be formed under Canadian law?  Seems it would need to be to 
achieve goal.  Let me know and I'll investigate.

Nora,

We may have an opportunity to do several auctions for the Ontario Electricity 
Finance Corp through a contact I have at Enron Canada (Aleck Dadson).  Aleck 
mentioned that we might have a better chance to close the deal if DealBench 
could be presented as a Canadian product.  

How difficult, costly and time intensive would it be to create a sub called 
DealBench Canada (or DealBench Maple Leaf or whatever)?  Just wanted to get 
your thoughts on whether this is even a possibility.

Regards,
Ross
