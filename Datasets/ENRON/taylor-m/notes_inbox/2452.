Mark -- can you look at Section 4 of this Agreement?  It applies to 
participants that want to enter into swaps -- while Mark or I could go to 
school on CFTC rules, I thought it would be faster if you could take a look 
at it and give us any comments -- thanks.

Travis

I assume you have seen this.  I am meeting with Truequote next week and they 
were asking questions relative to this agreement.  Are we prepared to 
transact under the conditions of this agreement?  Please give me a call to 
discuss. ext 30397

later e-mail to you our terms and conditions which will be posted to the
website once I have had the opportunity to clean those up a bit.
