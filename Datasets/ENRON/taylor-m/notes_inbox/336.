All,

We'd also like to thank everyone for their assistance in making the 
implementation of EOL in Australia smooth.

EOL has been well received locally with another 2 trades being completed this 
morning.

Regards
Paul Smith

Subject: Australia completes first trade

As you may already know, Australia completed their first EnronOnline 
transaction, for Australian Power  (May 00 Vic Peak) on Monday at appox. noon 
Australia time.

I'd like to thank everyone who worked hard to ensure a successful and smooth 
launch of EnronOnline in Australia.

Dave
