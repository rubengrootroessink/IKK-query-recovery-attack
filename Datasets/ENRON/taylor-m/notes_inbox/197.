You are cordially invited to attend  





If you are a new supervisor, an experienced supervisor without prior training 
or a manager of new supervisors, come and learn more about our new ENA 
Leadership Curriculum.  You will be introduced to the many courses and 
learning resources that are available to you and where you need to go to find 
them.  To aid in planning your developmental activities, you will receive a 
copy of the curriculum guide that contains detailed information about the 
curriculum.
Please RSVP by Friday, March 3 to Gracie Presas at ext. 3-3985.
