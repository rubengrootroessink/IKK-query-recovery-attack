Could you please review answers to the current FAQ's to check that they 
remain valid in relation to EOL Japan (refer attached). In addition, could 
you please write answers for additional FAQs that were used in the Australian 
launch (refer attached). Feel free to add any additional comments that you 
think are relevant.

I would like to get this out to the translators by mid-next week, so would it 
be possible to have a look at your answers by Monday?

Regards
Rousseau
