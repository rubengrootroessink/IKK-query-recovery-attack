This topic has moved up on the radar screen over here.  In addition to the
issues about setting up the shell corporation, what are the rules for the
Enron affliliates who trade on line?  Josie Castrejana in our credit group
has talked to Tom Moran in your credit group.  EOTT is concerned about
credit issues for the shell corporation.  How do you handle that with the
other Enron affiliates?  Who would post letters of credit or guaranties?
How does the contract get from the Enron affiliate to EOTT--is the contract
assigned or do we do back to back deals?  If this is a physical
transaction, we need to figure out a way to coordinate names on the
contract, credit, invoice, ticket, etc.  Also, who would nominate the
volumes?

Needless to say, we are not finished yet.  Please let me know when you
would be available to go over these issues.  Thanks so much for your help.

Molly
