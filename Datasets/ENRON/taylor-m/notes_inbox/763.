Pursuant to our meeting the other day, I would like to lay out the approval 
plan for the EnronOnline content.

Legal and Public Affairs will compile a list of statements which definitely 
are restricted and a list of grey area issues. (such as no trading advise)

All content for Phase 2 will be forwarded to Mark Taylor, Mark Palmer, John 
Gilchrist, Mike Danielson and Bob Shults.  Mark Taylor and Mark Palmer will 
approve all content for Phase 2.

Legal and Public Relations will determine which components of the content 
create potential hot spots and will discuss with Bob Shults/Mike 
Danielson/Shah

Legal will provide disclaimer copy for the web site that is global in scope 
and provide the appropriate font and location requirements

Once Public Relations and Legal get comfortable, content providers will 
follow restriction list and use best judgement to determine the need for 
Public Relations and Legal review.

Bob Shults will visit with Mark Koenig to identify Investor Relations issues.


If you have any issues or questions with the above please advise.
