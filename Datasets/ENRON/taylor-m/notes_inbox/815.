Do you think that we should give Susan B., Susan F.  and Tana an expression 
of thanks for their work during Marie's departure?  I was thinking that a 
gift certificate would be appropriate (e.g., spa services, Enron gift 
products, etc.) and it might send the message that we do know and appreciate 
their efforts.   Sara
