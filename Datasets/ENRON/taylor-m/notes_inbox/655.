Colin

Our VP in charge of admin in MG London Inc, Al Pennisi, has advised the CFTC
and
NYMEX verbally already that the Enron offer is on the table.

They have confirmed to him that they will only need a letter of confirmation
once the takeover is official. The letter will need to include an
explanation of
the new corporate structure (family tree). The "controller" equivalent term
for
the CFTC is "Material Associated Person". The appropriate regulation is
apparently 1.14 and 1.15 in thte CFTC regs.

If the corporate structure for MG London Inc could be confirmed asap,
similarly
to what we need here in London it would be a great help.

Tks and rgds.

Jon
