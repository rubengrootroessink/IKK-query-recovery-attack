http://testpulpweb0.ecomtest.enron.com:8001/site/index.htm  ---This is the 
URL to the most current build.  (Note: Travis- this is slightly different URL 
from the one
you have been looking at

Attached are 2 word documents.  The first is a final re-write of several 
sections of the website.  Once you get this we can talk on the telephone so 
that I can explain what sections replace where.  Hopefully it will be 
self-explanatory.  We are not looking for major changes (except from legal), 
but rather spelling, grammer, tense, etc.  Second is a letter we are sending 
out to a short list of valued customers on Monday to begin our 
pre-registration process.  Travis I sent this along for you review as well.  
Deborah, the only changes left are possibly yours and from the legal 
department.  As I said on the telephone, we are on a very agressive timefrome 
and it would have been great have several weeks to tighten everything up 
perfectly, but we are not afforded that luxury.  Give me a call at x36413 if 
you have any questions or comments.  Also the Frequently Asked Question 
rewrites will follow shortly.
