John please see attached GTCs for Australian weather. They are essentially 
the same as the example that was forwarded to B&M when they got the brief to 
advise on weather derivatives last month. 

I understand that B & M are having second thoughts on the gambling question 
and are due to come in with an advice on the point. 

There is also a question as to whether the Enron party will be Enron 
Australia Finance Pty. Ltd. or Enron Japan KK. From a tax perspective Susan 
what would you prefer? 

On a related issue what Enron company is on the Passwords Applications and 
ETAs that are being sent out? Although from a legal perspective it does not 
matter it may increase acceptance if it were Enron Japan KK.
