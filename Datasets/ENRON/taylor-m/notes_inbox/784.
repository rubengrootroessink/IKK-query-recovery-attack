To:  The Legal Trading Committee

In light of some recent comments of one of our counterparties, we are 
considering amending the Enron Canada Corp. Master Firm Gas Purchase/Sale 
Agreement (the "Master Physical Agreement") to clarify the events 
constituting  a "Seller's Deficiency Default" (see s.6.2) and a "Buyer's 
Deficiency Default" (see s.6.4).  We are also considering expanding the 
suspension rights of a "Notifying Party" to include the suspension of 
"receipts of Gas" under s.10.1.  

In this regard, please find attached a draft of an amended Master Physical 
Agreement which has been blacklined to indicate the aforementioned proposed 
changes.  

When you get the opportunity, please let me know if you think these changes 
are suitable/warranted.  I can be reached directly at (403) 974-6708.

Thanks,

Mark Powell
