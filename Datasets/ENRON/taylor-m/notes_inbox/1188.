Hi Mark,

We are currently talking with Natsource about offering them transaction ID's 
to transact on behalf of other counterparties on EOL. We were thinking of 
approaching other brokers to offer them this servie. Are there any legal 
repercussions of only offering it to certain brokers? WOuld we be obliged to 
offer the service to all the brokers if we offered it to some of them?
