Thanks for your response on this. I thought that in principle many of the 
hedges we used would be harmless, however, I would feel more comfortable with 
a more detailed review with you, particularly since one of the hedging 
transaction types involves the use of Enron stock.

Let me know when would be a convenient time to brief you.

Regards
David
