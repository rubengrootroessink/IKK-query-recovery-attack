Just to give a head's up,

In case I'm not here and you have to get something signed for EnronOnline, 
Louise Kitchen absolutely does not want any other officer signing documents 
for her group.  The only two signatories for EnronOnline are Louise and Andy 
Zipper, Vice President.  FYI, we do have a resolution in place that allows 
certain individuals to sign password applications (only!) on behalf of 
EnronOnline.
