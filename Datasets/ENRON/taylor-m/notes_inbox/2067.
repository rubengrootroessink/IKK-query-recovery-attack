Leslie/Mark,
We are going a few months back but I need your help on a question. Did the 
draft email below go out to the traders?
Was it sent to NA traders only? Was another sent to European traders? If it 
was sent, can you send Savita & I the final
memo?  

Savita has suggested that the point of contacts change to the designated 
people below.

Thank you for your help on this. Please call me if you have any questions.
Thanks.
Jennifer

Please follow up with Leslie or Mark. Also we should get it changed to have 
you as the lead, Torrey and myself as the back up in that order.Also if one 
was executed for Europe we should make Lara  the lead for those. Thanks.

Savita

Sheri told me that it was sent out to the traders. Actually, as I recall, I 
think I was put on it as a backup to Sheri for a point of contact. I'm not 
sure if European traders were sent anything. .

I can check with Leslie or Mark to confirm.  
Let me know if you want me to follow up on this or if would rather do it 
yourself.

Hi Sheri,

Hi Guys

Please see below the last email I had from Sheri re 3rd Party Trading 
Platform Policy.  Don't think the document was ever sent out.  Certainly was 
not sent to the European offices.

Andy and Sheri:

Here is a draft of what I propose Mark Frevert and Mark Haedicke send out to 
the traders re use of third-party electronic trading platforms.  Note that I 
included a contact for questions at the bottom of the policy.  I have listed 
myself for now -- who would you like to designate?  Will this e-mail go out 
to European and other business units as well, and if so, from the same 
senders?

Mark Taylor has approved the e-mail and the policy.

Let me know what you think.  I will circulate to Mark Haedicke for approval 
as soon as I receive your comments and/or approval.

Leslie
