Alan:
As I indicated to you in my voice mail message, I am currently working with 
Jane McBride on 2 ISDA Master Agreements with 2 Japanese banks.  I have read 
the latest Enron legal survey memo that our outside counsel prepared in 
November, 1999.  I noticed that the survey addressed matters relating to ECT 
International Corp.'s derivative activities.  In the 2 ISDA's that I am 
working with, the counterparty is Enron Japan Corp.  On things like governing 
law, arbitration, submission to jurisdiction, waiver of jury trial etc.  what 
is our position when Enron Japan Corp. is the counterparty?  Are there any 
special issues taht I need to be aware of in advising Jane on these ISDA's 
given the fact that Enron Japan Corp. is the counterparty?



Nony,
When convenient, can you send me a copy of the September 1996 letter that we 
sent to our counsel?
