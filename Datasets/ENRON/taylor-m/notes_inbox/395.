We are looking into setting up an electronic approval process for reference 
credits and counterparties. This would be based on a platform such as 
Livelink. The idea is that when  traders and originators would need an 
approval, they would enter the name (and a few other details) into an 
electronic document which upon submission would be automatically despatched 
to the relevant groups for approval, i.e., Credit and Legal. For a name to be 
approved, both groups would need to give their approval.

For this process to work efficiently, we need to be sure that each request is 
seen by at least one relevant person in each group. For the time being these 
persons are:

Credit:
 Bill Bradford
 Debbie Brackett
 Rod Nelson

Legal:
 Mark Taylor

Could you please be kind and confirm that these names are relevant and add a 
few more if necessary (which it is for Legal).

Many thanks

Tomas
