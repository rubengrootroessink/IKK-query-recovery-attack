Mike- I just spoke with fellow attorneys here in the Swap Group and was made 
aware it would be more appropriate for Scott Sefton's group to handle the 
drafting of an Agreement which entails Enron Corp. receiving all the assets 
of the LJM Swap Sub and making a payment of $30 m. to LJM Equity Partners.

With respect to the Rhythms Net Options component, I have included below the 
language which we discussed on the telephone. I would imagine this (or 
something similar) would need to be included in the document that Scott's 
group prepares. 

I apologize for the mix-up.

Kind regards, 

Shari Stack
