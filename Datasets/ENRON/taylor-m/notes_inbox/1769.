Attached please find my 11/1/00 discussion outline with Bob Baird's thoughts 
in italics.  Some of Bob's concerns are covered by current DealBench 
agreements (e.g., site license and access agreements).  

Today, Bob, Mark Taylor and I discussed possible EOL exchange related issues 
involved in a DealBench/EOL auction relationship.  The analysis may be 
complicated by unrelated DealBench exchange issues raised by other DealBench 
business plans.  Based upon a subsequent discussion with Suresh this 
afternoon, EOL exchange issues may be alleviated by latest plan to include a 
separate DealBench powered area within EOL for auctions with a link to 
DealBench merely for PR purposes (rather than a link from EOL to DealBench 
for EOL auctions to be conducted on DealBench).  Other unrelated exchange 
issues noted in outline may still need to be resolved depending upon 
DealBench business plans.  

As Suresh and I discussed, we need to further discuss some of the issues 
raised in the outline as DealBench business plans further develop.  Please 
keep in mind that we (legal) may need some lead time to resolve issues, 
particularly if regulatory authorities are involved (e.g, we decide to seek 
SEC or CFTC no-action relief).
