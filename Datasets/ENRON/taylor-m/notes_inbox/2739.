Mark:
FYI.  Could you please confirm what my reduced salary would be assuming I 
work 30 hours per week?  This memo doesn't say anything about salary.  
Thanks.  Also,  in order to put in 30 hours I was thinking that my office 
hours would be from 8:30 to 4:30 M-Th, although I'm sure that there will be 
plenty of times when it goes beyond that, but at least this is a benchmark.  
Are you okay with this?
