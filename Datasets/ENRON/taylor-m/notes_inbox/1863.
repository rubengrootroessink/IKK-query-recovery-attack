Hi Mark - Hope all is well.  Following our conversation of last week, I'm
attaching for your consideration the letter agreement that we discussed.  I
think this should cover the bases, but would be interested in your feedback.
Please contact me at (212) 902-0952 once you've had an opportunity to
review.  Best regards, Steve
