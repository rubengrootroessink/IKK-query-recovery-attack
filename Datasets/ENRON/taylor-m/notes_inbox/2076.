Mark here is the current LD for tanker freight here - it is slightly less 
descriptive but does still have a further defin. of the Index rather than 
just relying on the Route number. From memory I recall that this had 
something to do with Worldscale but this was so long ago I cannot remember 
what Worldscale is. I will check with the EOL people and revert. tks

Hi Robert, 

As requested, please find attached the Long Description for the UK Tanker 
Freight. This is the finalised version which will be available as of Monday. 
All we are going to do is replace the term "Pricing Period" with 
"Determination Period" in the second paragraph of the original version. 

If you have any questions please let me know. 
Regards 
Caroline PCG
