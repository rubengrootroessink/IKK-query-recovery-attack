Mark,

Have you had a chance to review these and are you happy that they are OK for 
uploading?

Is there anything which still needs to be done for you to be happy to sign 
off for the Australian launch?

I noted in an update from a few weeks ago that David Minns still had a couple 
of concerns from a regulatory perspective. Not sure if he has resolved these 
issues yet or not . . .

Dave
