Due to a delay with the printing of the direct deposit advices for the March 
30th payday, the advices will be distributed later than normal.  We 
anticipate the majority of the advices will be received by Friday 
afternoon.   Please be assured this does not impact the deposit of funds to 
your bank account.  Your funds will be available on payday, Friday, March 
30th.

Please remember that eHRonline provides functionality which allows you to 
electronically access your earnings statement.  If you need help with your 
logon id or password, please use the automated reset password and id lookup 
process online.  If you need further assistance with your ID or password, 
please contact the ISC Call Center at 713-345-4727.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
