Mark,

I spoke with Carol and Sara a couple of weeks ago regarding the possibility 
of updating this "policy" that I believe Justin put together many years ago.  
I think it would be an invaluable tool for your group as well as mine in 
understanding many of our positions on certain portions of the document. As I 
have been meaning to write a guideline to negotiation of the ISDA from the 
credit perspective for quite some time, this seems like a perfect opportunity 
to make the guidelines more complete. I think it will give us all a better 
understanding on why certain things are important as well as perhaps provide 
for a more interactive negotiation process between our groups. Let me know 
your thoughts.

Thanks,
Tanya
