Other jurisdictions on EnronOnline are:

AUSTRIA
BELGIUM
CROATIA
CZECH REPUBLIC
DENMARK
POLAND
PORTUGAL
ROMANIA
SINGAPORE
SLOVENIA

should  I assume that these jurisdictions are disallowed for Credit 
derivatives trading unless specifically approved?

Subject: Update to Approved Jurisdictions - Credit Derivatives

Per my conversation with Edmund this morning, we are moving Germany to the 
approved list for trading credit derivatives.  Below is the list, now updated 
to reflect this change.

European jurisdictions which are are approved for trading credit 
derivatives:  Finland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the U.K..

The European jurisdictions which are not approved to trade credit derivatives 
include:  France, Gibraltar, Ireland, Italy, Scotland, Spain, and The 
Netherlands.   For banks incorporated in a non-approved jurisdiction, it may 
be possible for them to trade out of a branch located in an approved 
jurisdiction (i.e. U.S. and U.K. branches).   This would have to be 
determined on a case by case basis.

Canada is also not an approved jurisdiction for credit derivatives.

Please let me know if there are any changes to this list.
