Mark -- 

Have you had a chance to review the CFTC's new rules?   I just received them, 
so I have not yet had time to read them.  

I'd like to get your feedback on these, and coordinate with you, Jim Steffes, 
Chris Long and others on Enron's response (if any) to the proposed rules.

Thanks.

Lisa
