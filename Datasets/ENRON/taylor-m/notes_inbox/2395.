Hi Mark -

Could you provide a quick update on the status regarding the Subject of 
whether the GTC's should continue to be attached to the Houston EOL 
confirmations?  If you would prefer, I can also arrange to discuss this in 
your office.  Please advise.

Thanks  -

Rob

Subject:  "The Legal Group in London (Justin Boyd) has advised that office 
that it would be OK to stop sending GTC's with confirms.  The London 
documentation teams in London have been advised to include the following 
language on their EnronOnline transactions that are governed under GTC's (not 
governed by Master Agreements):

"This Transaction is governed by the EnronOnline General Terms and Conditions 
(GTC) that you have accepted via EnronOnline. For a copy of this GTC, please 
click on the Product Description on the EnronOnline website and choose "View 
GTC".

Please advise if this policy may be applied to the EnronOnline transactions 
for the Houston office. "
