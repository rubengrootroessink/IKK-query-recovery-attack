I had a few minor suggestions, as set out below.  Please also note the=20
following:

SHELL had requested that the limitation of liability in clause 4(a) be=20
mutual; I have therefore left clause 4(a) as it stands, but added new claus=
e=20
4(c) below.

The risk of including the language in (b)(ii) below is that SHELL will ask=
=20
for Enron for a  indemnity to the extent that SHELL suffers Loss arising ou=
t=20
of Enron's breach of the Agreement.  I have also sought to restrict the=20
circumstances where breach by SHELL would trigger the indemnity - I believe=
=20
sub-clauses (a), (c) and (d) of clause 2 capture these.


 (b)  Counterparty shall indemnify, protect, and hold harmless Enron and it=
s=20
directors, officers, employees and agents from and against any and all=20
losses,   liabilities, judgments, suits, actions, proceedings, claims,=20
damages, and costs (including attorneys=01, fees) (collectively, =01&Loss=
=018)=20
resulting from or arising out of (i) any  Transactions executed through the=
=20
Website by any person obtaining access to the Website through the Passwords=
=20
(as defined in the Password Application), whether  or not Counterparty has=
=20
authorized such access, or (ii) any material breach by Counterparty of its=
=20
obligations under clause 2(a), (c) or (d) of this Agreement, provided  that=
,=20
in no event will Counterparty have any liability under this clause 4(b) for=
=20
any Loss caused by the negligence or wilful misconduct of Enron.

 (c)  SUBJECT TO CLAUSE 4(b), IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO TH=
E=20
OTHER PARTY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,   PUNITIVE OR=20
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF BUSINESS, LOS=
S=20
OF PROFIT, LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF DATA,  LOSS OF GOODWILL OR REPUTATION OR=
=20
WASTED MANAGEMENT TIME) WHICH MAY BE INCURRED OR EXPERIENCED ON ACCOUNT OF=
=20
EITHER   PARTY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT.

 (d) Nothing in this Agreement shall have the effect of limiting or=20
restricting either party's liability arising as a result of fraud.


Look forward to your response.

Thanks.
Justin
