Dear Mark

Thanks for your quick reply.  Here's some of the information you've=20
requested.  (Don't worry, I give a quick summary at the end.)


As for Telerate, we have an agreement with them (Enron Corp), but everythin=
g=20
that I have suggests that it's on an 'add users as needed' basis--which mea=
ns=20
that I question if we can even redistribute it internally, much less put it=
=20
out online.  However, Dan Diamond--of Mid Marketing--wrote to me saying, 'T=
he=20
mid market group has no "agreements" to distribute information.  The=20
information we distribute is similar to quoting a stocks price out of the=
=20
newspaper.'  If Dan is correct, then I guess we're covered, but I feel=20
uncomfortable taking news that we pay for (unlike a stock quote) and giving=
=20
it out to the public (like a stock quote).  I've written to Dan asking him=
=20
where else we could get the information from (assuming that, if we can get=
=20
the information from multiple sites, his comparison would be correct.)

On US Weather, I think we're fine:  "The National Weather Service =01v (NWS=
)=20
provides weather, hydrologic, and climate forecasts and warnings for the=20
United States, its territories, adjacent waters and ocean areas, for the=20
protection of life and property and the enhancement of the national economy=
.=20
NWS data and products form a national information database and infrastructu=
re=20
which can be used by other governmental agencies, the private sector, the=
=20
public, and the global community. "=20
(From their website)

Regarding NGTL Pipeline data, nothing has happened since we received the=20
letter that the lawyers signed in Canada--the letter that you didn't like. =
=20
(I have no idea what NGTL must be thinking about all of this--that we've=20
silently agreed to the contract?)  Donna's email does emphasize the need fo=
r=20
a password to the website--which suggests

For Canadian weather, I could not find a statement similar to US Weather=20
(above), but Paul Goddard spoke with them before he left, and they said the=
=20
information was open to all.  Additionally, none of the information on the=
=20
site appears to be copyrighted, which suggests that what they've said is tr=
ue.

Finally, the copyright on the actual pages is '1999 Enron Corp.  All Rights=
=20
Reserved'--should we update that for 2000 on information that we put out? =
=20
Can we copyright what is already public domain?  (I guess newspapers do tha=
t=20
with basketeball scores, so why can't we--but it's still a question!)

So, for the busy lawyer, here's the quick review

Telerate: Checking with Dan Diamond on whether or not we could argue that t=
he=20
information is public domain
US Weather: No problem
NGTL: Serious concerns--how do we contact them now?  (Do we wait for a new=
=20
content deal that could eliminate the need to use them? Rahil?)
Canadian Weather: No problem
'Copyright 2000 Enron Corp'?

I'll let you know when I hear about alternative information sources for=20
telerate.

Again, thank you very much


Jay
