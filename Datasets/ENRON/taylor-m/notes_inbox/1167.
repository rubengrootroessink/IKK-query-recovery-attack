We asked for some advice from Baker Mackenzie as to an legal rquirements, 
consents permits which may be requred for us to trade aluminium in Japan 
using EOL. I also asked them to provde advice on what would be required if we 
were to trade metal derivatives. Whilst the advice is not complete I thought 
you might find it interesting.

Dear Marcus

Please see our draft advice attached.

Unfortunately, as may be apparent, it still needs some work and should 
therefore
be considered as a draft only. In view of the urgency however I thought it 
might
be useful to get it to you even in its present form.

We will finalize the advice by Friday at the latest, but if you have any
feedback in the meantime it would make for a more meaningful product.

Also, let me know if you wish us to proceed with the wording changes.

Best regards

Paul Davis
