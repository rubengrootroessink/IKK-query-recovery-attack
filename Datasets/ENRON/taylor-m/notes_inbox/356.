Hi Dave!

Here's the proposal we discussed, which comes to $200/month. Normally we 
insist
on a minimum of $1,000/month, but I feel there are many bigger things we can
collaborate on down the road.

I haven't included pricing for the satellite and radar imagery because it's 
more
costly (I have fixed royalties that I have to pay on that) and because of the
complexity of having to track the number of users of Canadian radar.

On the North American satellite imagery, the cost would be $490/month on open
access and $380/month for restricted access, no limits on the number of users.

For Canadian radar, it's available as a restricted-access-only package of 
three
regional shots and a national image for $1,000/month minimum for the first 500
users, then $2/month/user for 501-1000 users, then $1.50 for users 1001-2500, 
$1
for users 2501-5000 and 75 cents/user thereafter. Simplicity is not a virtue 
on
this one, but these are restrictions imposed by Environment Canada, I'm 
afraid.

Please don't hesitate to contact me at (610) 407-2954 should you have any
questions or comments.

We look forward to serving your weather-information needs.

Best regards.
