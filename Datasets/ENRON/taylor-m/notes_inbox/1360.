Attached please find the finalized version of the CEA Legal Certainty
side-by-side analysis that was sent out today.  This is the side-by-side
comparison that Don and I discussed with many of you yesterday.

In addition, please find a copy of the cover letter accompanying the
side-by-side that was sent by the Coalition's representatives Mary Whalen
and George Baker (House version only attached; appropriately modified
versions for Senate and Agency recipients have been prepared by the
Coalition also but are not included).

If you should have any questions, please do not hesitate to call.
