Mark:

Attached please find a memo that I have prepared outlining content guidelines 
for the EOL Content team.  I am going to distribute to Dave Samuels, et al, 
today, as well as to Mark Greenberg.  If you have any additions or changes to 
make after you take a look, let me know and I will revise accordingly and 
redistribute.

I'm out all next week and want to make sure that this memo goes out before 
the baby decides to show up -- not due until the 16th of Jan, but you never 
know.

Leslie
