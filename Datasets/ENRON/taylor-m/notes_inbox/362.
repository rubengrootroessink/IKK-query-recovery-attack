Subject: Request to FERC to Review eCommerce Effects

Please see my note below regarding Energy e-comm.com's petition to FERC to 
review the effects of eCommerce on the regulated gas and power industries.

Their web address is:  www.energyecomm.com.  It isn't the best written 
petition (it's a little flippant at times), but it does deal with some issues 
important to eCommerce in the energy industry.  It has not yet been presented 
to FERC; they have the draft on their website for comments.

Thanks, this is good.  You should forward a copy of the web site where the 
petition can be found to Richard Shapiro, Jay Fitzgerald and Louise Kitchen 
in case they don't know about it.

There's some interesting info on their site.  We should obviously watch if 
their petition goes anywhere.  I printed the petition... it's written a 
little more informally than I would have expected, but it addresses a lot of 
important issues related to changing regulations to make eCommerce easier 
throughout the energy supply chain.  I don't know if FERC is already 
considering these issues, or if this will be the first request to look at 
them.

DRAFT PETITION SEEKS E-COMMERCE INQUIRY AT FERC
  Energy E-Comm.com has issued a revised draft of a petition asking
  FERC to initiate a notice of inquiry  into the effects of
  e-commerce on the regulated natural gas and power industries. The
  e-commerce-based company has posted it to its Web site so energy
  companies can comment further on the petition before it's formally
  filed at the Commission later this month.
