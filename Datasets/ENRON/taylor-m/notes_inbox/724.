Who in the legal department has looked at the reports that ENA sends to its 
customers.  I would like to get a download of issues we face in the US.  
Thanks.

We are planning to begin a weekly report on the gas/power/ other energy 
markets in Argentina.  This is common practice with ECT NA and Europe.  What 
legal hurdles do we have other than including a disclaimer at the bottom (or 
top) of every report??  This should be easy to determine by talking with 
counsel in Houston, no??  We want to start sending these reports out within 
the next two weeks (pre-winter) to both current and potential customers.

Thanks,
jf
