mergers, in-house lawyers report that they're content practicing law at

		American Lawyer Media 
		The U.S. Supreme Court ordered a new sentencing trial for a Texas death row

		The Associated Press 
		Victims of on-the-job mistreatment may collect unlimited cash awards to make 
up for what they would have earned if they had been treated fairly and stayed

workers' rights and civil liberties groups, and a setback for employers who 
hoped to harness jury awards that can often run into the hundreds of 
thousands of dollars.
