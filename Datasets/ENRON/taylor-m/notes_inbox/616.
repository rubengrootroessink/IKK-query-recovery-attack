Mark -- Enron Corp. is working on a new corporate profile and would like to 
include the following case study about EOL.  It is similar to the version 
printed in the Annual Report.  However, this version is shorter.  Could you 
give approval?  Since Louise is in Japan, I'll get her approval next week.  
Thanks.
