Mark, herewith the list I referred to in my last email.  I've looked to see 
if there are any CAs with a Duke entity with an Enron European entity and 
there are none.

We ought to come up with a streamlined procedure for approving new reference 
entities (rather than having it attacked contemporaneously on all sides by 
several departments).

Thanks, Edmund
