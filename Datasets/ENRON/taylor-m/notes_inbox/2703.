AOL, MICROSOFT FIGHT OVER INSTANT MESSAGING AS FCC CONSIDERS
MERGER

Two information technology giants--America Online and
Microsoft--are pulling the Federal Communications Commission
in different directions as the agency reviews AOL's planned
merger with Time Warner. Microsoft urges the FCC not to
clear the deal without imposing instant-messaging
"interoperability" conditions on AOL. . . . Page 9

CLAIM THAT AOL 5.0 CODE WRONGLY DENIED ACCESS TO COMPETITORS
ADVANCES

The class action litigation against America Online Inc. and
its version 5.0 software, alleging a common law product
liability claim and a violation of the federal Computer
Fraud and Abuse Act, moves forward with a trial date set for
2003 and an amended complaint recently filed. In essence,
the suits claim that the AOL 5.0 software makes it
impossible to get access to another ISP, once the software
is installed with AOL chosen as the default ISP. Also, the
plaintiffs claim, AOL knew from its beta testers that these
and other problems existed, but that the online giant
refused to fix the software before releasing it. . . . Page

LICENSE AMBIGUOUS ON REMOTE SERVICE AND STAND-ALONE PRODUCTS

A software license that did not specifically enumerate
permitted uses and contemplated purposes was ambiguous, a
federal district court in Michigan rules. Under the license
agreement, the licensee could sublicense the software only
as a component of its products. The dispute comes after the
licensee announced plans to offer services from the
company's premises remotely, via Internet. . . . Page 7

CIVIL SERVANT'S E-MAIL MESSAGES EXEMPT FROM RELEASE AS
PUBLIC RECORD

The contents of e-mail messages sent and received by a
county employee were public records under Washington state
law, but were nevertheless exempt from disclosure as
personal information, a Washington appeals court rules. The
court says that the number of personal messages sent by the
employee, who was being paid to perform government
administrative duties, was a matter of public concern, but
the contents of the messages were personal in nature and
outside the realm of interests promoted by the state open
records law. . . . Page 6

Lead Report

YEAR 2000: Xerox Corp.'s "considerable" three-year delay in
giving notice to its insurance carrier of potential
liability for Y2K remediation expenses prejudiced the
carrier and warrants dismissal of the action, a New York
trial court rules. The ruling appears to be the first to
address the notice issue, which is expected to affect
several other similar pending cases, including those brought
by Kmart Corp. and Nike Inc. . . . Page 4

ANTITRUST: An action against Microsoft Corp. alleging injury
from unlawful monopolization of the licensing market for
Intel-compatible computers is stayed by a New York trial
court, pending a decision by the plaintiff on opting out of
a similar federal action. The court also dismisses state law
class action claims. . . . Page 8

ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE: The final report issued by an
independent review team for Carnivore, the FBI's Internet
surveillance tool, reiterates an earlier conclusion that the
system does not provide adequate protection from the risk of
unauthorized FBI interception of private electronic
communications. The report is largely unchanged from a
previous draft. . . . Page 10

TRADE SECRETS: Alleged trade secrets concerning pen-based
computer technologies, acquired by Microsoft Corp. after
they had been placed in a patent application, were not
sufficiently secret to support an action for trade secret
misappropriation by the software giant, a federal district
court in California rules. . . . Page 8
