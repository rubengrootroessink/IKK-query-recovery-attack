RE: CFTC Approves Amendments to Natural Gas Price Limit Rules

DATE: December 7, 2000

Notice # 00-419

______________________________________________

The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., has received permission from the=20
Commodity Futures Trading Commission to expand the initial price limits of=
=20
its natural gas futures contracts; create uniform limits across all months =
of=20
trading; abbreviating the trading halt; and expand the new limits by 200%=
=20
when the initial limit is reached.

The amended rules, which are attached, will take effect for the opening of=
=20
the open outcry tading session at 9:30 AM tomorrow.

The Exchange announced this morning that the board last night voted to amen=
d=20
the procedures so the new natural gas limit will be $1.000 per million=20
British thermal unit and if any contract month is traded, bid, or offered a=
t=20
the limit for five minutes, the market is halted for 15 minutes.  When=20
trading resumes, expanded limits are in place that allow the price to=20
fluctuate by $2.000 in either direction of the previous day's settlement=20
price.

Currently, the market is halted for one hour if the price in one of the fir=
st=20
two months is traded at $.750 for five minutes.  When the market reopens,=
=20
those limits are extended to all months, but are moved to surround the=20
previous limit in place in the direction of the move.

Under the amended rules, if a halt occurs during the last two days of tradi=
ng=20
in a contract, when the market reopens, there are no price limits placed on=
=20
either of the first two nearby contract months.

(2) Except as otherwise provided in this rule, as a result of such Triggeri=
ng=20

wo=20

=20
shall be no additional trading halts and no further expansion of price limi=
ts=20

(C) Duration of Session Following Temporary Trading Halt.   When trading=20
resumes after a Temporary Trading Halt, trading generally shall continue=20
until the regularly scheduled closing time subject to the following=20
exceptions:

1) if, at the start of the 15-minute Temporary Trading Halt, there is less=
=20
than 15 minutes
before the close, then, when trading resumes after the Temporary Trading=20
Halt, the trading session shall be expanded as necessary to provide for=20
fifteen (15) minutes of trading following the resumption of trading, and th=
e=20
closing period shall be the final two minutes of trading of this 15-minute=
=20
period of trading;

2) provided however that if the five-minute Triggering Event is completed=
=20

=20
month and no expansion of price limits for any contract month; and

3) provided further that if the five-minute Triggering Event is completed=
=20

Trading Halt and no expansion of price limits during the remainder of such=
=20
NYMEX ACCESSc trading session, and

(2) there shall be no Temporary Trading Halt during a NYMEX ACCESSc trading=
=20
