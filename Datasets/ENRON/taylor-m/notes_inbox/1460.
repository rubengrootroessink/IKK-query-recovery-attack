Hi Mark

FYI - We are planning to launch the LME Registered Contracts on Monday 25th 
September.  We currently have all US counterparty profiles set to Read these 
products.  Please let me know whether the profiles need to be amended.

Look forward to receiving the detailed guidelines which we will need to 
incorporate into the PCG process and disseminate to all marketers.

Regards

Amita
