Dear Customer,

We have just updated Amazon.com's privacy policy and, because
privacy is important, we wanted to e-mail you proactively in this
case and not just update the policy on our site, as is the common
Web practice.  Thanks for being a customer and allowing us to
continue to earn your trust.

Thanks again for shopping at Amazon.com.


Sincerely,

Amazon.com
