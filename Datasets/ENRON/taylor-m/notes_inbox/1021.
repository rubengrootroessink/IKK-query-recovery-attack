Dear Amazon Customer, 

This month Amazon.com turns 5. As we hit this milestone,  we're reflecting on 
all you've done to help us make  our store a great place to shop. Without 
your help and  support, we simply wouldn't be where we are today. So  we 
wanted to do something fun to thank you. That's why  we created Five  Years 
of Favorites, a special area of Amazon.com  that combines a bit of nostalgia 
with customer wit and  wisdom. We've also sprinkled extra savings onto our  
everyday low prices.

Many,  many thanks for shopping with us. We hope you'll drop  in on the 
party. It runs from 7/14 to 7/24.

Sincerely,

David  Risher
Senior VP and Avid Amazon.com customer since January 1996



PS Plus, we've culled the  best--and worst--of five years of our two 
million-plus  customer reviews, showcasing the products you  love, and the 
ones you love to loathe. With your  help, we expose the secret shame of the 
Ant Farm . And we pose weighty philosophical  questions such as, Babe,  Pig 
in the City worthy sequel or, as one  customer puts it, "Babe, pig of death 
and destruction?"
