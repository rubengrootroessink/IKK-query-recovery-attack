Do you agree with Ken's analysis on the Gramm language?

I spoke to Ken.  He has reviewed the languge.  The only problem he sees 
theoritically is that the banking swaps will be given greater legal 
certainty. However, pushing for this treatment for the energy/metals 
provsions will likely not be helpful at this juncture.

Yes.  I don't think there is an issue.  I will call you shortly.

Ken - Did you get a chance to review the Gramm language and follow up on
the "rumor" that it would imperil the energy/metals exemption?
