Attached are the first pictures from my new digital camera.  I am sure you
have little to no interest in them, but I have to send them out to justify
buying the thing.

These were taken in Prague.  I highly recommend visiting the city if you get
a chance.

I am leaving for Lisbon tonight, so with any luck, I should be able to send
out more pictures next week (I know you can't wait).

 Keep in touch.

Later

Jim
