 Monmouth College's oldest building - and one of its most used - will
soon receive a major renovation thanks to a lead gift of $1 million from the
Edward Arthur Mellinger Foundation of Monmouth.
 "Renovations to our Auditorium have been needed for some time, and
this wonderful lead gift provides the impetus to raise the $2.75 million
that will be needed for the project," said Richard Giese, president of
Monmouth College. "Our plans are to make the Auditorium a first-class
facility for our campus community and for the local community as well."
 The renovation will impact the town of Monmouth by improving the
building that serves as a cultural center. Built in 1896, the Auditorium is
home to a number of very popular community events such as the Maple Leaf
Community Concert Series, the Prime Beef Festival Princess Pageant and
performances by the Ecumenical Singers and the Buchanan Community Chorus.
The Auditorium is also the site of the Young Authors Program for area
elementary students, as well as presentations for regional high school
students during the annual Teen Leadership Conference and various other
events sponsored by local organizations.
 "Our board decided to move ahead with this gift because it is a
natural fit with the foundation's commitment to excellence in education and
its desire to be responsive to community interests," said David Fleming,
president of the Mellinger Foundation.
 The Mellinger Foundation is a private, not-for-profit charitable
foundation that has been dedicated to furthering the education of students
in western Illinois and eastern Iowa since it was founded in 1959. Original
funding for the foundation came from a bequest of $5 million from the estate
of Inez Mellinger Hensleigh in memory of her brother, Edward Arthur
Mellinger. Currently the foundation has assets of nearly $25 million, and
distributes about $1 million per year in scholarships to nearly 1,000
students, of which 140 are enrolled at Monmouth College this semester.
 "The Mellinger Foundation has been such a wonderful supporter of the
college," said Giese. "We owe the success of the Mellinger Teaching and
Learning Center to them, and they've also provided numerous scholarships for
students to attend Monmouth. Their gift to the Auditorium project is just
another example of their strong partnership with Monmouth College."
 The renovation project includes plans to air-condition the building,
making it a year-round facility. All-new main-level seating will be added
and a new permanent sound system will be installed. Restrooms will be added
on the main floor, the balcony seating will be improved and other changes
will increase the visual and aural options for musical performances. The
lower level of the Auditorium will also undergo a complete makeover, with
the addition of dressing rooms and remodeled practice rooms.
 The exterior of the building will remain true to the original design
of architect Dan Everett Waid, an 1887 MC graduate, while the improvements
within the building will make it a much more functional and effective
facility.
