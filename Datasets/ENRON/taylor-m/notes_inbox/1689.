Mark -

Attached is an outline of what the site is intended to look like (as designed 
in PowerPoint).  The name - LegalOnline - has pretty much been determined, 
but the logo and tag line are still up in the air.  I put the attached 
together to give the IT design group an idea of the look and feel we are 
trying to hit.

I welcome any suggestions or comments and would be more than happy to walk 
you through the way it is envisioned the site will work.
