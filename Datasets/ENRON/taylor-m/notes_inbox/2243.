Justin - haven't heard anything else back from Justin B ; as per your=20
voicemail he is away until 9 April, so suggest you get back in touch with h=
im=20
then.  I tend to agree with Mark Taylor's view re: perhaps best not to use =
=20
'EOL' or 'EOL Manager' and the like given our substantial existing investme=
nt=20
in the brand/trademark 'EnronOnline'.    =20

At the same time, the press are often referring to 'EnronOnline' as 'EOL', =
so=20
if the trademark 'EOL' is in fact still available, Kal Shah and I are of th=
e=20
view that it would make sense to apply for it for possible use,  and also t=
o=20
preclude others in our market from securing it (though at some stage we wou=
ld=20
need to demonstrate use vs. just applying for the trademark itself  for it =
to=20
afford us any legal protection).    =20

My concern from a marketing standpoint is not to dilute the 'EnronOnline'=
=20
brand or logo by also using the term 'EOL'.   However, if we could secure t=
he=20
trademark, it would be nice to have the option of using it at our discretio=
n=20
(e.g. perhaps more so in interviews and press releases , rather than creati=
ng=20
a logo/brand for EOL, which I think we should avoid ).  Clearly though, if=
=20
anyone else already has the 'EOL' trademark for the same goods and services=
=20
classes we would be looking for, we would need to steer clear of this=20
entirely to avoid infringing on that trademark.

Happy to discuss this further.

Subject: "EOL" Trademark

Justin - Apparently Dave Forster is keen to potentially register the domain=
=20
name 'eolmanager.com '  (currently available) for purposes of our Third Par=
ty=20
Access initiative.   I suggested to Justin Rostant  that he check 'EOL'=20
trademark availability via Mark Palmer in the US, but also said I'd touch=
=20
base with you.   Could we (or Mark) do a quick trademark avail. search on=
=20
'EOL' (as opposed to EnronOnline proper)? Is it possible Clifford Chance,=
=20
Linklaters or S&M already did this as part of the drive for EnronOnline=20
trademarks?   =20

The website 'eol.com' is taken by a company called Entertainment Online but=
=20
it looks like quite a small , lottery entity of some kind, so it's possible=
=20
they haven't applied for TM but would still have established use.        =
=20

From an EnronOnline marketing and legal standpoint, to date we have=20
deliberately avoided using 'EOL' externally for fear of brand dilution and=
=20
trademark infringement respectively.  However, if in fact the trademark =20
'EOL'  (or failing that 'EOL MANAGER') is still available for the taking (a=
t=20
least in the context of online commodity trading).  perhaps we should apply=
=20
for it for the appropriate goods and services classes .   =20

As a follow on point, if the trademark for 'EOL' is indeed held by someone,=
=20
would we be infringing on their trademark if we registered 'EOLMANAGER.COM'=
=20
?  My personal opinion is that we would be free to do so - hard to establis=
h=20
we'd be trying to pass off as 'Entertainment Online' for example, if we use=
d=20
eolmanager.com to conduct our regular business.

Also, It just occurred to me that Rahil did some quick checking on this a=
=20
long while ago and I believe found there was a trademark holder out there -=
-=20
possibly the same EOL Incorporated / Entertainment Online listed below. =20
Rahil , if you remember anything on this can you let me , Justin Boyd and=
=20
Justin Rostant know?

Thanks,
Paul
