Mark, the Chicago Merc just came out with a new rulebook -- in large part to 
reflect its newly demutualized structure (it completed demutualization last 
month).  Chicago Merc is the exchange for live and boxed meats (and also 
trades the only exchange-listed weather contract to date).

Cost of the new rulebook is $100 -- could we get a copy?  If so, please let 
me know and I will ask Taffy to order.  Thanks -- Bob
