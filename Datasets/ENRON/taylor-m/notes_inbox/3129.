Are you and Mark unavailable?  I probably cannot represent her, but can ask 
John Novak.  You will need to coordinate with John prior to the PRC.

Side question to Diana Perez: Is it even appropriate for Andrea to be 
reviewed by the ESA Regional PRC (when she is part of ENA)? What is being 
done on the business side in similar circumstances?

Randy

Randy, would you be able to represent Andrea at the Business Unit PRC in Sao 
Paulo?
Thanks,

She is a Senior Counsel.  Consistent with our conversation earlier this week, 
I would place her at the director level.

OK...thanks, Brent is the Supervisor, Mark is the PRC rep for the functional 
meeting in Houston and we have the Business Unit PRC in Sao Paulo...I will 
assume Brent that you will represent Andrea.
Is she a  manager level or director?

thanks,
diana

In this case, I would view you as Andrea's supervisor and I would be her 
representative at the PRC which would be here in Houston.

Aren't you technically the Supervisor of Andrea?  What would be her PRC?
