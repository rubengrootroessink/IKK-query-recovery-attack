Mark:

It was funny running into you yesterday in Enron's lobby.   I had just
received the Skadden Alumni book and had tagged your name to give you a
call.  You were the second Taylor that I ran into in Houston in my brief
trip: I also saw Lyndon Taylor of Skadden's Houston office on the street.

I now work at V&E's New York office.  I left the London office of Skadden in
March of this year and went to V&E's London office for 5 months.  I returned
to New York in August aftter four years in London.

I do project finance and bank work as before.  I was at Enron working on a
power deal yesterday.

I hope all is well with you.  Please let me now what you're up to.
