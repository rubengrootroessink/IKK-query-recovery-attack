We may not want to do this if this means that ENA becomes a MAP, if it is not 
one already.

Sorry for the delay in confirming this point.

Enron Trading Services Inc ("ETSI") can act as agent for ENA in arranging 
transactions with North American Metals customers, so as to take advantage of 
the ENA ISDAs with the respective customers.

ENA will need to pay compensation to ETSI for its services as agent, and a 
services agreement will therefore need to be put in place.

ENA will then need to enter into a back to back transaction with Enron Metals 
Limited. The back to back transaction will need to 
1. transfer the economic metals postion to Enron Metals Limited; and
2. recover the cost of the service fee paid to ETSI; and
3. leave a margin to cover the credit risk assumed by ENA (this margin needs 
to be at market rates). If no credit spread is to be left in ENA, the back to 
back contract will need to be written such that all credit risk is passed 
through to Enron Metals Limited (ie ENA does not pay Enron Metals Limited 
unless ENA is paid by the customer).

Regards
Janine
