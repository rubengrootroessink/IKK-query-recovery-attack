(1)  Market quotation v. Loss -- At one of the workshops at the ISDA 
conference in March, I picked up some tips from the Goldman Sachs speaker 
that I have found useful in arguing on behalf of Loss.  I think we should 
also put before the group a uniform acceptable carve-out for MQ (in terms of 
duration and commodity), with the understanding that we should only offer the 
carve-out after every effort has been made for Loss applied uniformly.

(2)  Legal opinions from international counterparties -- I think we could use 
clearer guidelines on when to require these.  My own thought is that we 
should try to get comfortable with going without to the extent possible with 
respect to Western European counterparties (absent any red flags particular 
to a counterparty).  Paul Simons' input would be very useful here.
