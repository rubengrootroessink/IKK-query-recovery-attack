Mark, these two have apparently been involved with / driven our weather 
derivates group in Houston. A very good friend of mine (NOT me!!) has been 
offered a position with a fund in the set-up of which these two are involved. 
Could you give me any intelligence on them?
Jeffrey Bortniker  and Lynda Clemmons
