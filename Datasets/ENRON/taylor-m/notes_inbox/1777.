This is important that we advance through this quickly. I would like this 
document turned around in 24 hours. IE Read it and be prepared to go over it 
at 5 pm.
We should shoot for financial power products to be up next Monday.

I have attached a revised draft of the ENA Annex A that is designed for use
with counterparties in Argentina.  The document is blacklined from the
current version.  Please contact me at 212-504-6427 or David Mitchell at
212-504-6285 with any questions or comments.
