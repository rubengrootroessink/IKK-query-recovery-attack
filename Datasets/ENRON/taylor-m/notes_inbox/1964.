(5) CLASSIC CARIBBEAN
"The boring season." That's what locals call the summer months on
the diminutive island of St. John. It's the time of year when
hotel occupancy slips below 50 percent, and entire days pass
without a single cruise ship calling at the nearby island of St.
Thomas. But is that really the case?
http://www.TRIP.com/news/completetraveler.cgi?a=3_4976

VISIT GLAMOUR, HISTORY ABOARD THE QUEEN MARY
When you stay in the Queen Mary, you stay in a hotel one describes
not in stories high but in tonnage, 81,000 tons to be exact. It is
a place where rather than checking in you come aboard. You stay in
a stateroom, not simply a room. And you look out at Long Beach's
skyline through a porthole, not a window.

France and Austria: Where to schuss
From lifts to lodgings, Alpine resorts are a deal.

(6) SO MUCH WORK
You want to get the folks you care about great gifts, but you're
in Michigan today and Toledo tomorrow. Here are some great ideas
for busy travelers, for everyone on their lists.
http://www.TRIP.com/news/completetraveler.cgi?a=4

(7) LIGHTWEIGHT GIFTS
Looking for gift ideas for that special road warrior in your life?
Or wanting to add a few more items to your own letter to Santa?
Here are some suggestions for gifts that a business traveler could
use all year long--from least expensive to the priciest.
http://www.TRIP.com/news/completetraveler.cgi?a=20

(8) SAFETY FIRST?
If you knew which airline had the best safety record, would it
influence your air travel purchases? Or are frequent flyer miles
the only thing that matters? Would an objective comparision of
safety factors make a difference? Or would you cast that sort of
caution to the wind, in favor of a decent connection and arrival
time?
