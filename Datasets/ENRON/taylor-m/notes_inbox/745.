Subject: Euro 2000 Proposed Site Nav. and Language



I have attached two documents that describe how to play Minute Mania, and
the proposed navigation and language for the contest site.  Please add the
appropriate language that we would like to see, and return comments to me
as soon as possible so that we can increase the probability of success when
we see the site for approval Friday morning.

thanks
Dave
