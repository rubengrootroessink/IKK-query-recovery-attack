I have been informed that, within approved jurisdictions, only approved 
counterparties can be shown the credit derivatives quotes that are on 
EnronOnline. If this is the case I need a list of all customer Global IDs for 
US counterparties that will be allowed to see the quotes to enable this data 
to be loaded today. 

Are you in a position to provide this data or (if applicable) confirm that 
all US counterparties on Online can be enabled to do so?

Subject: Update to Approved Jurisdictions - Credit Derivatives

Per my conversation with Edmund this morning, we are moving Germany to the 
approved list for trading credit derivatives.  Below is the list, now updated 
to reflect this change.

European jurisdictions which are are approved for trading credit 
derivatives:  Finland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the U.K..

The European jurisdictions which are not approved to trade credit derivatives 
include:  France, Gibraltar, Ireland, Italy, Scotland, Spain, and The 
Netherlands.   For banks incorporated in a non-approved jurisdiction, it may 
be possible for them to trade out of a branch located in an approved 
jurisdiction (i.e. U.S. and U.K. branches).   This would have to be 
determined on a case by case basis.

Canada is also not an approved jurisdiction for credit derivatives.

Please let me know if there are any changes to this list.
