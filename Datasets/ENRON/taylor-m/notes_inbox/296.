Edmund,

How about this?

Please forward to me a copy of whatever you would like to send before you=

send it.

Thanks,

Dave


Further to the recent queries you raised concerning the ETA, we can provide=
=20
you with the following comfort.  The final sentence of clause 2(d) prevents=
 a=20
Counterparty from claiming that the ETA has not been duly accepted or an=20
offer has not been validly made or that a transaction has not been validly=
=20
entered into solely by virtue of the electronic =01&click=018 method of sub=
mitting=20
offers or execution.=20

This same principle provides protection to you in that the only binding=20
transactions upon both yourselves and Enron are the ones in which certain=
=20
terms have been clicked upon by you and the same terms accepted by Enron=20
through the automated EnronOnline process. The system is designed to ensure=
=20
that the terms of the offer you submit are the only terms which can be=20
accepted by Enron. As a result, there have been no instances in which a=20
customer offered on one set of terms, but Enron accepted a different set of=
=20
terms.
