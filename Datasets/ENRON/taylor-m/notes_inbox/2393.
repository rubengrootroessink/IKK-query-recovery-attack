		 Subject: EnronOnline Broker Client

We have begun the testing phase of a broker application that will allow 
Brokers to execute transactions over EnronOnline on behalf of their clients.  
We anticipate that there will be four brokers online when we launch on or 
about March 19, 2001.  Between now and the launch date we will be giving 
these brokers additional user ids to view prices on EnronOnline.

Listed below are the brokers that will have access and the products they will 
have execute rights on:

1. Amerex: Worldwide gas, power, crude products and bandwidth
2. Prebon: North American gas and power; European gas and power
3. Natsource: North American gas and power; Emissions; Coal
4. Power Merchants: US Financial Gas 

All transactions which are executed by brokers on EnronOnline numbers will be 
free of brokerage charges.  We are under non-disclosure agreements with each 
of these brokers and therefore should not discuss the terms of these deals.  
The brokers are particuliarly concerned about the impact with other customers 
if the terms of these agreements become public.

We are in discussion with other brokers to provide this same service.  I 
encourage you to contact us with any brokers that may have an interest in 
viewing and executing on EnronOnline prices.

Please call me with any questions or concerns at 713 853-0397.
