Dear All,

Some of your may already know, and by the time you finish reading this all of 
you will know, that I am after 9 years leaving Enron.

After nine years with Enron in Europe, working in Human Resources, UK Gas & 
Power Origination, Weather Trading, EnronOnline and now Enron Credit I have 
accepted an opportunity to move on to a new venture in the City. 

I will be the CEO of the International Weather Exchange (I-WeX.com Limited) 
which is a venture involving LIFFE, Willis Insurance and Intelligent 
Financial Systems Limited, which will provide data, forecast , research 
information services and a risk transfer marketplace for climatic risk.

I would like to thank all of you personally for making the time here at Enron 
so enjoyable and rewarding.

If you are in London this Friday I will be located in the upstairs bar at the 
Grouse & Claret public house from 6pm and would be happy if you could join me 
for a farewell drink before my departure.

If you want to contact me. you can reach me at home on +44 1462 769277 (new 
mobile and Office numbers are not known yet, but if you would like them let 
me know and I will send them to you once I know them) or use my personal 
email account Nick.Mooney@London.com.

Regards

Nick
