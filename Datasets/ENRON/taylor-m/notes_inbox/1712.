Shona Wilson suggested that you may be able to assist with the following 
request for information. We are having to make some filings with the CFTC 
arising out of the acquisition and change of names of the MG entities. 
Specifically we are advised that , we will need to supply a corporate chart 
showing the relationship with all previous MG entities and Enron Corp. We 
will also need to provide a brief description of the acquisition itself.

Apologies for the short notice, but the filing will need to be made on or 
before 25 November and we will need to conduct a full review with external 
counsel to ensure that the correct filing is made.

If you need to speak to me my number is 713 345 8161.
 
Kind regards
 
Marcus

Please note that there is a global review of Agency agreements that is going 
on for the entire metals structure at this stage.  It is totally linked with 
the tax structuring for metals that is being undertaken.  The resolution to 
this issue will therefore depend on the tax department's timing.  Tina Ward 
is heading up this intiative.

Many thanks
