Sami,

FYI, the forwarded mail below requests copies of my performance review 
feedback which I have already handed to Erica Mestre.  I think your mail is 
in reference to my objectives, for which again, I apologise for the delay.  I 
am aware that Mark is on vacation, however, I will be seeing him next week 
during my trip to Houston and hopefully will get his input then.  I have also 
spoken to Brent who said that in Mark's absence, he will be glad to provide 
at least a preliminary review of my objectives.  I will get back to you as 
soon as possible.  Thanks for your understanding.

Regards,

Andrea
