Well Charlottesville actually has its own airport (looks a bit like St 
Thomas).  But DC is the only other place close by - and then a rental car (or 
bus or train).  I have an extra room reserved at Keswick Hall - very 
expensive - and at some point I have to release it or pay for it. Check it 
out at www.Keswick.com.    Rooms are tight over graduation weekend.

That's a great idea - I'll see if I can line up a boat - anywhere in
particular you'd like to sail?  (BVI makes sense if there's a newcomer
along.)

Where do you fly into to get to Charlottesville?

I can sail anytime - Amanda is a tougher nut to crack.  She graduates on
May 20.  Wanna come to Virginia for graduation and then we could all leave
from there?

Any interest in Barcelona for a long weekend?

I can't believe you have to change planes in Chicago AND Dallas!  I don't
remember you being that willing to suffer for a cheaper ticket.

Bummer - looks like I'll just have to be the wimp this time.  There's
really no way I can get away next week.  I have heard of las ventanas - but
I didn't know about the evian spritzing.

Maybe next time.  Any more thoughts on a week that works for sailing?  I
could spring for a bottle of evian and a plant mister......
