Carrie -

After speaking with Susan about the Annex, it was determined that a few 
changes needed to be made for consistency sake within the Website.  I have, 
therefore, made some minor modifications and have provided them below.  

Essentially, we are going to call information provided to the Modules by a 
User or Counterparty simply Commodity Information.  This will be further 
defined in the CL glossary of terms in a generic manner so that it can 
encompass all types of information related to Commodity Transactions, 
regardless of the Module within which a User or Counterparty is working.

Please take a look at the attached and let me know your thoughts.
