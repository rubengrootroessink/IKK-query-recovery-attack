CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGED

I have made several redlined changes to the last paragraph before No. 3 
dealing with the size of Enron online.  SAM--can you review that section to 
see if you think the language used would tend to make FERC consider 
regulating Enron Online?

Also, re: language in the 2nd para. of No. 2.  The traders said that third 
parties can post "limit orders" to limit the price they are willing to pay 
EPMI.  The traders said that they can see who is placing the limit order and 
can move the EPMI price if EPMI wants to transact at the limit order.  The 
next trade may then be at the higher, original posted price.  I have not 
viewed this, but asked the traders that sit by me, so Lisa, you may know more 
about this.

Everyone:

Attached is a revised redlined version of the EnronOnline filing, and we now 
have signoff from EnronOnline, so we should be ready to file.   I suggest a 
few coordination efforts before we submit the filing:

First, EPMI is making the same filing amending its tariff and code of 
conduct, so we should submit the filings on the same day.  

Second, it has been suggested that we call someone at FERC (perhaps Kevin 
Madden) before we make the filing.  We made a similar call to Kevin before we 
starting using EnronOnline for pipeline capacity, and he seemed to appreciate 
it.  Also, by calling ahead of time, we can answer any questions FERC may 
have about the filing.  I suggest that we (Enron) make the filing since we've 
had contact with FERC in the past about EnronOnline.

We're preparing the EPMI filing now, but it should be ready to go tomorrow, 
so hopefully we can make the call and file tomorrow if this works for 
everyone else's schedule.

Sarah
