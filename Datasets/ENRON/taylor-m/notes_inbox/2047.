Just wanted to let you know I appreciated Mary's effort in turning this 
around so quickly even though her workload was quite heavy due to the KCS 
VPP.  The situation was not handled very well prior to it landing on her desk 
(which we can discuss if you are interested), but true to form, Mary saved 
the day.

Thanks,
Tanya

Please see the attached draft for your review and comment.  Please note that 
in the interest of time this draft is being distributed prior to complete 
internal review and comment.  It is therefore subject to further comment by
