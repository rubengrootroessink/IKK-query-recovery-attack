Just a few comments on the Text:

You may wish to specify throughout that all time references are to "GMT"
The examples given for the offline nominations procedures imply that 
nominations/re-nominations made by the customer are NOT effective until Enron 
has  responded affirmatively - this is not how the underlying GTC reads 
(under which such customer nominations/re-nominations become effective 
without subsequent Enron's "confirmation")
On the last page , I would remove the reference to a Master, since this does 
not currently apply to EnBank trades
Presumably , you are not now proceeding on the basis of a separate ATA (i.e. 
Auctions Trading Agreement governing EOL access)?

Otherwise, I am happy with the form of Text.

Justin
