Sometimes it's the little things that make the biggest impact.

Maybe you've never stopped to think about it, but for many of us, Post-it 
notes may be one of our most frequently used communication tools at Enron.

Because of this, every employee received, or soon will receive, a packet of 
Post-it notes with a thought-provoking quote about communication.  These 
Post-it notes reinforce the importance of communication at Enron.  The 
individuals who are quoted on the notepads personify the true meaning of 
communication.

We hope that as you use these notepads in your daily work, you will think 
about the importance of communication to the continued success of Enron and 
work just a little harder at communicating more openly at Enron.

Please email Gina Taylor (gtaylor@enron.com) for Post-it note distribution 
inquiries.
