are there any templates you use when rejecting a prospective EOL C/P due to 
insufficient creditworthiness (i.e. fails the CFTC net worth, etc test)?

Thanks.
Justin

Subject: Rejection letter for EnronOnline

Hi Justin

I could really do with some help on this!

McTaggart Shipping and Management have applied for access to EOL, however 
Credit have rejected their application 
due to the fact that this counterparty do not pass the CFTC test for 
financial trades. I have spoken to Paul Maley about this
and basically McTaggart don't meet the required financial requirements. 

I have constructed a draft letter to send to the customer, and I have run 
this past Amita, but we're not sure on how we should 
phrase the reason why we are rejecting them. Credit have told us not to be 
too specific. 

Could you possibly help us out with how we should draft this letter?? 

Pierre Aury (trader) has been in contact with this customer and apparently 
they are pretty touchy!!


Thanks 
Caroline
