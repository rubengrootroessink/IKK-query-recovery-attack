Rob Walls has referred me to you. I don't believe we have met but I am (for 
my sins) the acting General Counsel at Enron India. We are thinking of 
starting coal trading activities in India and I am trying to get hold of some 
standard form contracts we may have used for our coal trading activities in 
North America. Would it be possible to forward any such forms to me so that I 
can start the exercise of seeing what issues we may have under Indian law. 
Perhaps you could e mail them or alternatively have someone fax them to me on 
(91) 22 288 1793/4.
Many thanks

Sandeep
