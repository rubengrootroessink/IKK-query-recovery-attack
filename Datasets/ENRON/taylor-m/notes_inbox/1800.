I appreciate the level of detail we are going to in the analysis of how to=

manage offshore products to mitigate US taxation risk but I believe the=20
reality is that we are going too far. If we are actually concerned about th=

level of detail then we should not do operate in this fashion at all. If=20
someone really wanted to come after Enron's US income in relationship to th=

structure and the manner in which we are operating daily there are plenty o=

other arguments they would make first.=20

I would propose a better analysis would be regarding the precedent cases in=

which Argentina has gone after US income tax noting the details,=20

The reality is that I do not expect to operate in this fashion as a primary=

isolating the risk via a local structure. In addition it still is not prove=

It might be more expedient to move forward and deal with any issues as they=

arise knowing we can always adjust or stop the activity.

Your comments would be appreciated and thanks for expediting things so far.

Mike,

Regarding the implementation of an Argentine Financial Power product in=20
EnronOnline, where the Enron entity transacting is ENA, certain issues need=
=20
to be clarified and then communicated.

Whoever will run the Stack Manager for this product has to be physically=20
located in US?.
Does that person who runs the Stack Manager need to be an ENA employee or c=
an=20
a ESA employee execute the transaction on behalf of ENA?.
Can Julian sitting in Buenos Aires have read only access to that product on=
=20
the Stack Manager?.

Once these issues are clear by Legal and ENA, and the person who will run t=
he=20
Stack Manager is identified (Alberto Carre=0Fo?), we need to communicate al=
l=20
this to Dave Forster in order to get the EnronOnline staff involved in=20
implementing the product.

The Product Description is ready and the GTC is in Brent's hands to be=20
finalised. Once the (i) devaluation language, (ii) collateral arrangement a=
nd=20
(iii) Index language are added to the GTC, it should be finalised; so I=20
understand. The other thing that we need from legal is the Confirmation=20
Template, which will have to be sent from Houston to the counterparts (Scot=
t=20
Mills team need it).=20

I would appreciate your help in getting these issues in place ASAP, so that=
=20
we can get our product online by December 4th.

Thank you.

Patrick
