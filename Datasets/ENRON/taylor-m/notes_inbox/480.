We will soon be receiving International sports news through our deal with 
Reuters.  We have also started exploring various options with Sports.com (via 
CBS) about getting their content on EnronOnline.  Please make sure all the 
content related discussions are held with both Dave Samuels and myself as 
we'd like to avoid having patchwork solutions for the site.

Also, all content we receive via Reters will be goverened by the Agreement 
we've negotiated with them (as overseen by Mark on the Houston legal team).

Regards,
Rahil

Hi James

My understanding of Louise's request was that several sports news pages would 
be posted with sports scores being updated on the website during the week for 
intra week events.  Please clarify.

Will the content provider provide info about European and Asian sports?  Do 
we need to involve Justin/Edmund to get the European legal perspective or 
does the content deal cover this already?

You will have seen the sports which held the most interest for the traders 
here - can you let us know whether the content provider has sufficient info 
to enable us to post score data.

Regards

Amita

Dear Arfan

Thanks for all your effort.

We're working on a content deal that will give us as much sports news as we 
want.  Until we can launch this second phase of EnronOnline, we'll have to 
rely on other third party content for general news items (as in Europe).  As 
best I understand it, this occasional news will be placed on the site at our 
discretion--Julie Ferrara will be responsible for publishing North American 
content, and I'm responsible for European content.  So if there's something 
on that everyone's talking about (Football?), then we could publish a news 
item, if we'd like.

As for the legal issue, I spoke with Mark Taylor (lawyer for Enron North 
America) over a month ago, and he (correct me if I'm wrong, Mark!) seemed to 
differentiate between 'public domain' content and 'proprietary' content, the 
difference between the two being whether or not you could possibly get the 
information from any other source.  I think sports scores is usually in the 
'public domain' category.

So let's keep up the good work, and if you want to prepare a possible 
football related news item, let's move towards publishing it (always going 
through the normal channels, of course).

Thanks Arfan

Jay

Whilst Anna is in Singapore I will be looking at the Sports ticker ideas.

Anna has discovered a web page called www.sports.com which has all the 
information that we could possible require in any European country.

plus US Sports links
launched web site in other languages - french, german, italian and spanish

special "Best of the Web" edition
website was launched August 1999
reporters are on site for major events
site is used by other leading internet information providers
