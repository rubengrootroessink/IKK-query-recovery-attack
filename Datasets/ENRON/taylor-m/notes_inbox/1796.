I share Alan's position - irrespective of whatever due diligence has already 
been carried out, it will have to be revisited anyway for pulp and paper.

Kind regards

Mark

Steve:

I have shared with Peter what information we have collected from previous 
trading-related legal surveys we have done in the aforementioned countries, 
which surveys are not specific to pulp & paper trading.

It's possible that someone in Alan Aronowitz's groups has looked into similar 
issues.

The pulp & paper group is looking into physical trading in the Far East 
(mainly Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Singapore).  I am looking into any tariff or 
taxation issues related to transacting in this region.  I've been talking to 
Peter DelVecchio and he was in the process of contacting outside help in this 
matter but then I realized that some of this work might have been done 
already since we trade liquids in that part of the world.

Do either of you know if this information is available internally?

regards
steve
