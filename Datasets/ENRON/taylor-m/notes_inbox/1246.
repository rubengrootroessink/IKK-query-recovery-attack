Hey Mark, nice to hear from you.  I am glad you enjoyed the wedding.  It went
by so fast for me but it seems that people had a good time.  Apart from a few
travel related glitches the honeymoon was also spectacular.  Tahiti is a true
paradise.

I am committed to the concept of sailing in the Carribean but my problem is
that my honeymoon has put me firmly in "vacation deficit" at the SEC.
Barring any emergency congressional action I will not have enough days
available by Tgiving to truly enjoy sailing in the Carribean.  Amanda has
told me how much fun it is and I want to do it but I may need to find another
time.  I'll check into it and let you guys know definitively very soon.  How
long to you go for?

Keep in mind though that I do not speak for Amanda.  She has an uncanny
ability to arrange her schedule so that she can participate in virtually
every vacation idea that people bring up.

I'll be in touch,  Bill.
