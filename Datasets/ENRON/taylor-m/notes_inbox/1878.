Hello Mark,

So much to do. So little time. Slow down!  This weekend, send yourself on a 
Site59
Getaway or Red Carpet Escape, leave the Santa suit at home, and still give 
everyone a
gift they'll love this holiday season:

Site59 Gift Certificates -- http://www.site59.com/gift-certificates -- 
Available in any
amount, valid for a full year, and redeemable for any Site59 experience from 
nights on
the town to complete weekend getaways.

To make sure you have something for everyone on your list, I've taken a 
little extra time
to compile a longer list of our Top Picks for this week.  And remember, 
you'll find even
more offers to choose from at  http://www.site59.com!
