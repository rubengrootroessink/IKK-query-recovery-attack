Mark;

Congratulations on your appointment as VP & GC for Enron New Works.  I have 
received a copy of Mark Haedicke's legal memo and would like to ask you who 
in your group will be covering trading and EnronOnLine activities in South 
America.  I have noted that Andrea Calo will cover Argentina.  Will she also 
cover Brazil ?  Did you have time to discuss this matter with either Randy 
Young or Mark Haedicke ?  I greatly appreciate your thoughts on the matter.

In the meantime, please be advised that I will be preparing a legal memo re. 
EOL Brazil.

Regards,

Sami
