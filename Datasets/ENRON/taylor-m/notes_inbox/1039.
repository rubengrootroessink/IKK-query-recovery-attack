Because of time constraints, we added the words "Patent Pending" on the home 
page of clickpaper -- same line, same type size, etc., but will probably go 
back and add it in a few other places at a later date.  A notice is not 
legally required, but it's helpful and a nice marketing touch as well, so you 
should consider putting it where it's most likely to be noticed.
