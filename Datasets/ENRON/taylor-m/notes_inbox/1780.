Dear Gentlemen:
Attached please find the draft Enron Trading Services Risk Assessment Report 
to
be filed with the CFTC.  Included in this report is a cover letter, the
Organizational Chart, and Sections 10 (Capital Requirements) and 15 (Risk
Management) of the ETS Futures Compliance Procedures Manual.  Also attached 
for
your convenience, is a blackline version of Sections 10 and 15 to reflect the
changes we have made.

Please note that we have not listed Enron Corp. as a Material Affiliated 
Person
of ETS based on our review of the preamble to CFTC Final Rule 1.14, defining a
Material Affiliated Person, and on our conversation on a non-disclosed basis
with the CFTC Auditor .  Should you have any questions or suggestions 
regarding
the report, please contact me at the telephone number listed below.  Thank 
you.
