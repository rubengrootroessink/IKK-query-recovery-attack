Any answers on this?

Also have you checked into the Reuters agreement to see if it would cover 
confidentiality associated with a potential price posting discusion.

Bob - please pursue, you will need to talk to Mark Taylor as there were 
regulatory issues with the funds.

Thanks Mark  - we'll pursue - hope things are well with you too.  All is 
going fine here.

Subject: new counterparties for EOL?

Louise - I think that John indicated to me that he had or would be suggesting 
to you that hedge funds might be a group of counterparties to get online with 
EOL.  I have also suggested to John, and pass along to you now, an 
additional/different group.  Lately, I have been receiving proxies from a 
number of the mutual funds (the equivalent of your unit trusts and investment 
trusts in the UK) I own (some with the Fidelity funds family in Boston, some 
with the AIM funds, based in Houston [but with a UK parent]), seeking (and 
receiving) shareholder authorisation to trade in commodities.  Particularly 
given the cost pressures on mutual funds these days, the low-cost option of 
EOL would seem a good product for them.  Anyway, in the event that you had 
not targetted this potentially large number of counterparties and funds, I 
wanted to pass along this suggestion/idea.  Hope all is going well.  mcs
