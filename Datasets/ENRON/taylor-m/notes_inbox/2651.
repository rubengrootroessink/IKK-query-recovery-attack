Sara,

We are going to receive an NDA form from W-Technologies to sign and return to 
them.  I will forward it to you when it arrives.

They are asking me what company name to put on the form.  I work for Enron 
Net Works and my user is Gary Hickerson so can you please let me know what to 
tell them.

Regards,

Chris
