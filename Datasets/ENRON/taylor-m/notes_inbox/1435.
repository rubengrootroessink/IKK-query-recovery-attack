Linda,

Nice to hear from you.  I sent Amanda an e-mail yesterday congratulating her
on the wedding.  Good to see that everyone survived and had a good time.
You must be very proud of your now grown up, married and employed daughter!
I heard she received an offer from Simpson.  That's great for her.

As for me, can you believe that I'm still here at Gardner and going into my
5th year!  Neither can I.  I need to go drop out and live on an island
somewhere.  I promise to stay until Nov. 4, though.  I'd love to get
together with you (we can even drink rum jumbees here) provided that I'm in
town.  I probably do need a tune up from you.

I am either flying to Miami the evening of the 4th or the morning of the
5th, I should know shortly.  Our boat is going down for the Mumm 30 world
championships.  A week of racing in the Atlantic.  Should be fun, but a lot
of work.  Are you coming in the 3rd or the 4th?

Finally, as for travel, my dream trip right now is Australia/New Zealand for
3-4 weeks.  I also want to get back to South America.  Have you been to
Argentina or Chile?

Let me know what your plans are, I'd love to see you.

Fondly,

Greg

Yes Amanda is still at amh5h@virginia.edu.  and mark taylor is at
mark.taylor@enron.com.  Mark came to the wedding - so he can give you
all the details (what the bridesmaids wore, the color of the flowers on
the cake - all that interesting stuff).
Mark was trying to organize another trip to the Caribbean at the wedding
reception.  I haven't been back since I was there with you.  So I guess
it has been too long.  Mark suggested that we go the weekend of Nov 4.
It was a coincindence that he picked that weekend, because I have a
meeting in Chicago on Nov.  4.

So either way Nov 4 will work for me - either I will be drinking rum
jumbees on St John or I'll be drinking [beer] in Chicago.  [what drink
is chicago famous for - nothing comes to mind.]  If I make it to Chicago
on Nov 4 - will you be there?

When do you think you will get to Manhattan (where we are famous for our
martini s)?  I am amazed that you are doing so well without any advice
from me for several years.  Really I think you should come in to town
for a little "tune up".  How are things going for you.  Your email
didn't have many clues.  And your family - what is happening?

I had a tarot card reading for my birthday (don't ask - some loopy
friend gave it to me as a gift).  Anway the tarot card lady said I am
going to be travelling.  So I am asking everyone where they think I
should travel (and that is not a straight line).  So what sounds good?
What great destinations are on you r short list?

Keep in touch

Linda,

Happy birthday to you!!  Did you spend it down in the BVI drinking run
jumbies?  I can only hope so!

How have you been?  I understand that Amanda's wedding was a couple of
weeks
ago.  A friend of mine sent me the announcement from the NYT.  You two
are
SO New York society.  I hope you all had a good time and everything went
off
well.

Life here is fine.  I've done a lot of sailing and golf this summer.  We
actually went down to the BVI for a week in April.  I thought about our
trips down there, especially our anchoring debacle at the Bitter End.

Are you going to be in Chicago any time soon?  I'd love to get together
for
dinner or a drink if you have the chance.  If not, I hope to get to NYC
sometime this fall and I'll give you a call.

Is Amanda still at her e-mail address at UVa?

Talk to you soon.

Fondly,

Greg
