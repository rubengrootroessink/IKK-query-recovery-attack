Mark -- A friend of mine saw an ad that Enron is hiring for an Intellectual 
Property Attorney and sent me his resume.  He has been an Intellectual 
Property attorney for a company in the Woodlands called Telxon.  Could you 
consider him or forward to anyone you may know who is hiring for this 
position at Enron?  I would really appreciate it.  If you need any other 
information, please call me at x 39354.
