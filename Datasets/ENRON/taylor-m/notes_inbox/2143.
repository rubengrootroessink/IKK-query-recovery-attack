Hey guys, there is a new program for people who travel frequently to make 
sure they are setup for remote access called Ready To Go. I thought it might 
be something you'd want to check out. Here is the link on the intranet 
explaining how it works: 
http://itcentral.enron.com/Data/Services/Ready2Go(NAonly)/. Remember when you 
schedule your people for appointments in the comment field put my name as 
your floor tech. That way they can track how successful the program is by 
floor. Thanks alot!
