Susan:
I think that it woulod be helpful to come up with a generic form that we 
would use when we are amending an ISDA that was entered into before our 
latest set of form changes were made.  The aamendment that you did for Flacon 
Creek may be a good starting point.  Could you please come up with a draft 
form that we can review?  Stop by if you have any questions.
