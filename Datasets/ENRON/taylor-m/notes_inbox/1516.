Dear Dan,  I have attached the updated PWD with the changes that you and I
discussed the other day.  I apologize for the wait, I ended up being covered
up by an avalanche for the last several days.  I hope that your trip was
good.

We are excited about how things are turning out with the project.  It looks
like the final project is going to be fantastic.

Thanks for all of your help.  Call me if you have any questions.

Lamar
