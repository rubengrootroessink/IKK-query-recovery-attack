Doug Leach said you were the expert.

I am publishing a chart using NYMEX settlement average prices by month in 
1998 and need to cite where the #s come from.  Doug said you would know.  Is 
there a data bank that has these prices or a hard copy that I can reference 
(publication, title, date, page).

Thank you very much,

ROB
