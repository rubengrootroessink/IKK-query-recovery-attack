Mark,
I have attached a confirmation for a Lumber swap that was done today. The 
deal will have weekly Calculations with the prices in the publication coming 
out every Friday. However, payments will be made on a monthly basis.

Thank you very much for your help in this matter. Please give me a call if 
you have you any questions or if I can be of any help to you.
