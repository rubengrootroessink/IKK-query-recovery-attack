No, if it is an approved customer that Enron would otherwise talk to over the 
phone.  We always have to be careful about assuming advisory/fiduciary 
duties, as would be the case in telephone communications.  I got your voice 
mail on the direct access issues; let's try to talk some time on Wednesday.  
Thanks.

Do you see any problems with a customer having the ability to chat with an 
Enron
representative online?
