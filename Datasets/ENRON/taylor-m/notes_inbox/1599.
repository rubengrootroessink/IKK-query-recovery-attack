I have since our call yesterday spoken to SHELL about clause 4 (particularly 
(b)) - we are still struggling to reach agreement.  SHELL are very unwilling 
to accept this sub-clause (b).

However, there is a possibility that they will accept a narrower version of 
it, modified in such a way as to specify the limited circumstances where the 
indemnity would apply (you and I briefly discussed yesterday those 
circumstances).  SHELL will only contemplate giving the indemnity where these 
circumstances are clearly defined.  Please would you therefore re-draft 4(b) 
accordingly.

Incidentally, this is the one remaining issue.

Thanks.
Justin

Please could you let me know what losses, liabilities, etc are contemplated 
by clause 4(b) of the ETA, as attached.

I am in negotiations with a large trading counterparty who are unwilling to 
accept it - and I would like to given them examples of the losses 
contemplated.  I am struggling myself!

Many Thanks.
Justin
