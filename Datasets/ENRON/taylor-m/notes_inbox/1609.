Mark:

FYI re a legal roundtable in Washington DC re e-commerce issues relevant to 
the energy industry.  (The Dynegy lawyer is extremely friendly and mentioned 
this to me.)  Just thought I'd let you know in case you think we need an 
Enron presence.  Renee mentions in her e-mail that someone from Enron is 
supposed ot attend although she doesn't have a name.

Here is the overview of the seminar we discussed.  I looked on my notes and
supposedly someone from Enron is attending, but I do not know that person's
name.  I will get back to you on the ETA within the next day or so.
