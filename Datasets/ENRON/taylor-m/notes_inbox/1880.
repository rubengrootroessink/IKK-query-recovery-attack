Mark - 

 I need your advice and help with this revision to an EnronOnline location 
description.  
Dick Jenkins is concerned with contractual problems and requests an urgent 
revision to the location description (TETCO M3) that follows:

The transaction is for delivery at Texas Eastern Transmission Corp. - Zone M3.


He wants to ensure that the delivery shall also include anywhere on the M3.  
Therefore, I have revised the location to the following:

The transaction is for delivery at Texas Eastern Transmission Corp. - Zone 
M3, and all downstream delivery on the M3.  

Please advise if this is appropriate as we need to get a ticker item posted 
on the website as soon as possible.  

Thanks -

Rob
