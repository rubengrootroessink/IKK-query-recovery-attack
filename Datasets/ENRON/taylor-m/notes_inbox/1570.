Mark,

I was looking through our list of PA's and was struck with the following 
questions:

- Why did we decide to use ENA, Enron Power Operations and Enron Australia 
Pty as the three Enron companies which appear on the PA's? Political?
- Why do the EPOL and EAP PA's say "for itself and on behalf of its group 
undertakings from time to time" (shouldn't the ENA ones say that as well?)
- Is there any reason why we shouldn't update all of the PA's for EnronOnline 
LLC as the Enron company?
- Should the EnronOnline PA (For U.S.) also say "for itself and on behalf of 
its group undertakings from time to time"?
