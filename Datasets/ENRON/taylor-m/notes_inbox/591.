I expect to be receiving invoices for legal fees associated with Enron Net 
Works (specifically paper.com, but there will probably be some for other Net 
Works matters as well, such as EnronOnline).  Have work order numbers already 
been established for these?  Who is handling the processing of Net Works 
invoices?
