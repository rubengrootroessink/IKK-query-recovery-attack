at your request, enclosed is a memo summarizing the conference call you and I 
had Friday with Ken Raisler. 

As promised, this is the memo I sent out on January on the ambiguity 
regarding "agricultural commodities" in the new law.  Lisa Yoho and I are 
working on a memo updating these issues that we hope to put out shortly for a 
larger distribution.
