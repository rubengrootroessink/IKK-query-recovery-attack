Attached are credit w/ss for four new cps, targeted for trading ENA's new fwd 
Rig Day Rate product.  Please send all four contracts directly to John Peyton 
at EB 3584B.  John is requesting that the Diamond Offshore and Noble Drilling 
drafts be ready by Friday morning.  I made no promises and asked him to speak 
directly with you guys.  He has apparently had conversation with Mark already.
