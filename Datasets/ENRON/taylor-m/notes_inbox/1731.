Any possibility of adding a back up for me in case of my absence?  Jennifer 
Denny is the person I would like to designate.  

I assume (Andy, correct me if you think otherwise), that this message will go 
out to all business units, and we here in Houston will handle everything.

Thanks
Sheri

Subject: Third Party Trading Platform Policy

Andy and Sheri:

Here is a draft of what I propose Mark Frevert and Mark Haedicke send out to 
the traders re use of third-party electronic trading platforms.  Note that I 
included a contact for questions at the bottom of the policy.  I have listed 
myself for now -- who would you like to designate?  Will this e-mail go out 
to European and other business units as well, and if so, from the same 
senders?

Mark Taylor has approved the e-mail and the policy.

Let me know what you think.  I will circulate to Mark Haedicke for approval 
as soon as I receive your comments and/or approval.

Leslie
