Mark,

During my conversations with Patrick Hansen (from the Buenos Aires office) 
yesterday he mentioned that in Argentina the above mentioned contracts have 
to be in Spanish to have legal value. Is that correct? Or we would be covered 
as long as we offer the contracts in Spanish in addition to English 
(functionality currently present at the site)?

Thanks,

Mario
