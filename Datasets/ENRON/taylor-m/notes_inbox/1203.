Alan/David-

Attached hereto, are the GTC's with Enron Japan Corp. as counterparty for EOL 
trading of Japanese weather derivative HDD swaps.  The US GTC's were utilized 
as the basis of the documentation.  The GTC's have been tailored to the 
Japanese market in conjunction with Baker & McKenzie, Tokyo.  

Please review and provide comments prior to loading onto the EOL system.  I 
note that September 1, 2000 is the date on which trading on this basis is 
expected to begin.


Cheers,

John
