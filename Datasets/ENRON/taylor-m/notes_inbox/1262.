To all,

One of our customers, ALCOA, has been registered on EOL for the OTC metal 
products, but is having problems accessing the trading site.

The problem stems from two areas:

1) When ALCOA accesses the trading site,  the prompt for Enron's terms and 
conditions comes up with a further prompt to agree or disagree to the 
conditions.  ALCOA's legal team has determined that they should not agree to 
the conditions because they have an existing ISDA agreement in place with MG 
Ltd.

2) ALCOA has talked to EOL's help desk (specifically Kathy Moore), who 
subsequently has determined (I assume with Enron legal) that the current ISDA 
in place with MG Ltd. is sufficient to begin trading EOL's OTC metal products.

In further discussions I had with Mark Taylor today,  he basically confirmed 
that the ISDA that's in place is valid for EOL's OTC metal products, but said 
that I should confirm with either Edmund Cooper or Justin Boyd in London for 
final confirmation of the legal questions, and Frank Davis for the EOL access.

In addition, Mark alluded to the probability that Enron legal/compliance does 
not have a listing and/or copies of ISDA's that MG Ltd. has in place with 
customers.  If you'd like, I can help facilitate that.  Please advise.

Could you confirm for me the following via telephone and/or e-mail:

1) That the current ISDA ALCOA has in place is valid for EOL's OTC metal 
product trading.

2) That their account can access the site without the term and conditions 
prompt.

Please contact me if you have any further questions or concerns.

Regards,
BEF
