Louise and mark:
As I mentioned to you yesterday, a number of the online counterparties that I 
have spoken with have requested the right to terminate.  Here is my suggested 
language to deal with this issue as a modification to Section 6(a) of the ETA 
and clause (1) of the Password Application:

1. Language modifying Section 6(a) of the ETA


"... and shall remain in effect unless and until this Agreement is terminated 
(i) by Enron upon written notice to Counterparty, to take effect immediately, 
in accordance with Section 6(e) or (ii) by Counterparty upon written notice 
to Enron which is telecopied to Enron to ____________, Attention: 
_____________, to take effect by [5:00] pm (Houston time) on the day that is 
one (1) Business Day after Enron's receipt of such notice...."


2. Language modifying  clause 1 of Password Application:


..., Enron will have no responsibility whatsoever for controlling or 
monitoring the use of such Passwords and no liability for any use of such 
Passwords until such time as Counterparty shall have notified Enron in 
writing (and such notice shall have become effective as provided below) that 
such Passwords should be denied access to the website and/or that a Password 
can no longer be used by Counterparty to enter into transactions on the 
website, such notice to be sent by Counterparty to ______________, Attention 
:______________, and to become effective at 5:00 pm (Houston time) on the day 
that is one (1) Business day after Enron's receipt of such notice, it being 
understood that Counterparty shall be liable for any transactions consummated 
on the website before such notice becomes effective.   

Please let me know what you think.
