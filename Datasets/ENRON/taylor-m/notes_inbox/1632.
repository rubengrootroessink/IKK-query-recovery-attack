Enron Trading Services Inc. will be acting as an IB/ FCM/Agent for internal 
and external clients 

EOL
Futures
Swaps

I would anticipate that we will leverage EOL and our client relationships 
across most if not all of the commodities. Many of these commodities have 
historical futures arbitrage between NY and London ---- an arbitrage 
opportunity between markets and clients for Enron

Base Metals
Precious Metals
Energy
Softs

Justin:

Do you know what other business MG London Inc. is or anticipates doing with 
these same counterparties?  It may make a difference if they are acting for 
these customers as an FCM.

Gentlemen, 

I met with Craig Young (MG US) last week, who is keen to progress metals 
business with large US corporates (e.g. Anheuser Busch), on the following 
basis:

o Assume ENA and US Corporate are existing parties to ISDA/Credit Support 
Documents (the "Master").

o ENA and US Corporate would agree to expand range of OTC products to include 
OTC metal derivatives under the Master.  The principals to the metals trades 
would therefore be the US Corporate and ENA.  These trades would however be 
"arranged" by MG London Inc. (an FCM) as "arranger" in the US for ENA.

o Enron Metals Limited (EML) from London would agree to provide metals prices 
to ENA and/or MG London Inc. in the US, and in return receive a commission 
from MG London Inc.

o ENA would back-to-back OTC metals derivatives with EML via an intra-group 
ISDA Master.

Look forward to your views.

Thanks.
Justin
