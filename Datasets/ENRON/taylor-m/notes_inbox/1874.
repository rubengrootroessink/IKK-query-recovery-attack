Amita has just told me that their is a global effort to standardise the GTCs 
for weather trading worldwide, therefore you will need to consult David 
Minns  and Mark Taylor before signing off on any GTCs.

Thanks

Arfan

OK, I think we are nearly there..... here are the amended documents. I had a 
double check with the old docs and found that we needed to have a defenition 
for data source (especially in the case of the UK Met offices website - there 
are 2 data sets for max and min!!!). This has been added and the AVT 
defenition changed.

In the product long descriptions for other European locations: "The Data 
Source shall be obtained from the relevant reporting service" (might have to 
get better wording from Justin for this).

Cheers

Catherine
