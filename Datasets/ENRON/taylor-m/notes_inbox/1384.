Hi Sue, 

I have no problem dealing with the CFTC/NYMEX/NFA. I need to have information 
from Enron on the following issues pursuant to CFTC Reg 1.14 and 1.15:

Organizational Chart, which includes the MAP's 
Risk Management Policies and proceedures
Financial Statements for certain of the MAP's and a description of the MAP's 
duties and functions to the FCM 

This needs to be done by November of this year. 

This information is due within 60 days from the last quarter in which the 
change took place. Change took place in the middle of July, end of the 
quarter is September '00.  Therefore  the information is due by the middle of 
November'00.

If anyone has any questions please call me at 212 715 5845.
