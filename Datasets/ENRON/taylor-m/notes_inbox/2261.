Subject: Your Invitation to Enron's Executive Forum - 1st Quarter 2001

The Office of the Chairman would like to invite you to participate at an=20
Enron Executive Forum.  This invitation is extended to
anyone who attended an Executive Impact and Influence Program within the pa=
st=20
two years.  These informal, interactive forums
will be 90 minutes in length and held several times per year.

Most of the participants in the Executive Impact and Influence program have=
=20
indicated a strong desire to express opinions, share
ideas, and ask questions to the Office of the Chairman. Although not=20
mandatory to attend, the forums are designed to address those issues.  They=
=20
also afford the Office of the Chairman opportunities to speak directly to i=
ts=20
executive team, describe plans and initiatives, do =01&reality checks=018, =
create a=20
=01&rallying point=018 and ensure Enron=01,s executive management is on the=
 =01&same=20
page=018 about where Enron is going---and why.

To accommodate anticipated demand, we currently have two sessions:

Choice: (Please rank in order of preference 1 or 2 for a session below.  Yo=
u=20
will attend only one session.)

______ Thursday, March 29, 2001 from 2:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. in EB50M

______ Friday, March 30, 2001 from 2:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. in EB50M


The Office of the Chairman will host the forum. Here=01,s how it will work:
? Each session will have approximately 20 participants.
? The format will be honest, open, interactive dialogue.
? This will be your forum. Don=01,t expect to simply sit and listen to=20
presentations.=20
? This will not be the place for anonymity. You can safely ask your own=20
questions and express your own opinions.
? You can submit questions/issues in advance or raise them during the forum=
.
? Some examples of topics you might want to discuss include, but are not=20
limited to: the direction of Enron, business   goals/results, M&A activitie=
s,=20
projects/initiatives, culture, leadership, management practices, diversity,=
=20
values, etc.

Because the forum will work only if everyone actively participates, we=20
encourage you to accept this invitation only if you=20
intend to have something to say and if you are willing to allow others to d=
o=20
the same. For planning purposes, it is essential that=20
you RSVP no later than Friday, March 16, 2001 by return e-mail to Debbie=20
Nowak, or via fax 713.646.8586. =20

Once we have ensured an even distribution of participants throughout these=
=20
sessions, we will confirm with you, in writing,
as to what session you will attend.  We will try to honor requests for firs=
t=20
choices as much as possible. =20

Should you have any questions or concerns, please notify Gerry Gibson by=20
e-mail (gerry.gibson@enron.com).  Gerry can also be reached at 713.345.6806=
.

Thank you.
