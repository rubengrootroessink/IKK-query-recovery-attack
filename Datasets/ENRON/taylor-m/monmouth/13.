Mark,
 Come over to my house on Saturday afternoon (around 3:00).  We can
go over to Tahiti at the ZBT house for a short while (I don't know many of
the brothers anymore but I still like to go to Tahiti).  At 6:00 we can go
to the Barnstormer for supper.  You are just in time to help celebrate my
birthday.  Dick and Sandy Giese,  Dick and Lorna Valentine,  Pete and Lynn
Loomis (Director of Building and Grounds), and Perry and Dalene White (Music
Dept for Perry and Dalene works for Dick Valentine) will all be present.
This will be the third year we have gotten together (Pete and I both have
birthdays next week).  We will all get a little crazy together.   Looking
forward to seeing you.
     Doc
