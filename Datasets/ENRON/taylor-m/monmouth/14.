 Monmouth College recently received a gift of $1 million from Ann
Mack Collier, and her husband, John, of Mukilteo, Wash., President Richard
Giese announced Tuesday.
 Mrs. Collier is a 1963 graduate of the college and a member of its
board of trustees since October 2000.
 "Both Ann and John are outstanding people who have a great concern
for young people and their education," said Giese. "I certainly want to
express heartfelt thanks on behalf of the entire college community for their
consideration of Monmouth in this wonderful gift."
 A mathematics major at Monmouth, Mrs. Collier earned a master's
degree in education from the University of Maryland in 1973 and taught math
at the high school and college levels for 27 years, retiring in 1997 as
associate professor at Northern Virginia Community College. Her husband is a
retired associate dean of the School of Area Studies in the Foreign Service
Institute, State Department. Together, they served as teachers in the Peace
Corps in Sierra Leone in western Africa from 1963-65.
 "Ann is a tremendous asset to our board, and I look forward to
working with her and the other trustees to create an even better Monmouth
College for the future," said Giese.
 The Colliers previously established two unitrusts for Monmouth
College. Their $1 million gift is unrestricted, and the college plans to put
it toward the $5.5 million Hewes Library renovation campaign.
