Keegan, as per my voice amil, Jarvis' pager number is 713-768-0402.  You can leave a voicemail message.  The pager will probably be off from 9:30 to 11 (the viewing) and 11 to 1 (the funeral).  You can also leave voicemail for me on my work line and I will check it at about 1 or 1:30 p.m. and again between 4 and 5 p.m.  Thanx again for everything.

Cheryl just received word that a close friend of hers has died of a heart attack, and she is leaving immediately.  If you have any questions, contact me at 5-3317.
