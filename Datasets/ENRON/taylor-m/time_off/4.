Please note that Kayla is on vacation.  

Also, could you please send an email that I am on vacation starting tomorrow for one week in Nw York.  I will be doing a minimum amount of work from home.  I will check in to see if there are any emergencies on Friday.  I will not be reachable tomorrow at all because I will be traveling for most of the day.

I may not be able to be reached immediately.  In case of emergency, you can reach me by calling (but not leaving a message) at 212-212-926-2012 and/or leaving a message on Jarvis' pager at 713-768-0402.  (Keegan, please do not give out the numbers- just indicate that in case of an emergenycy, you, Frank and Mark can get in contact with me).  After tomorrow, I will check in with you and voicemail periodically.
