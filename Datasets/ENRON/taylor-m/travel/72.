Hello, Mark:



Make any resolutions for the New Year??I've got one for you.?Now repeat after 
me... I will be more spontaneous. I will have more fun. I will indulge my 
whims. my desires. my sense of adventure. I will do it today.Sounds a lot 
better than going to the gym or giving up chocolate, doesn't it? 

So do it this weekend (a three-day weekend for many, I might add!)  and save 
$50.*

No excuses. No regrets. And even more great deals to be had at?Site59.com
