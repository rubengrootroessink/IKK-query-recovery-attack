What kind of a fool do you think I am.  No way I am getting in the middle of you and Amanda on vacation plans.  I'll just pack my little bag and wait at the dock until you two show up.  I will however give you both a credit card number - it is 5410 6584 0536 6574  exp 11/01

I have tentatively booked us on the QE2 sailing from Southampton at 5pm
on August 29, arriving New York at 7:30am on September 4.  You and
Amanda have a Caronia class cabin at $2045.32 per person, including air
from New York to London (with a business class upgrade on Continental).
I have a single in the same class (so we eat in the same restaurant).
My plan would be to fly over on Sunday evening - the 26th - since I have
to be in Ohio that morning.  With that in mind I have also booked jr.
suites for us at "41" the all-inclusive London hotel near Buckingham
Palace that I've mentioned to you before.  They are at 275 GBP per night
(2 nights).  Of course, if you guys wanted to go earlier to spend more
time in London, I am sure that would be possible.

The difficulty is that Amanda has indicated an interest in staying in
Europe longer - certainly understandable.  Her preference would be to go
over on the boat leaving NY on September 5, arriving in Southampton
Sept. 10 and then stay in Europe for a few weeks.  That doesn't work
quite as well for me because I only have 6 vacation days left and on
that routing I get one less day in London - i.e. we get off the boat on
Monday morning and I have to fly back Tuesday morning.  On the other
hand, we wouldn't be jet lagged on arrival in London!

They will hold the reservation until tomorrow.  What's your preference?
