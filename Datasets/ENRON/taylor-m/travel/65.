Bill,

Thanks for the info.

Just so you know, The Moorings provides airport transfers so there will be
somebody with a "Moorings" sign waiting right after you get through customs
who will get you into a van or bus to the base.  It's a little harder to
get to Tortola from Houston so I leave at 6:10 in the morning but don't get
there until a few hours after you guys (on AA5684 which gets there at
5:21).

 It turns out I also need everyone's birthday and address.  Mind sending
yours along?

Mark
