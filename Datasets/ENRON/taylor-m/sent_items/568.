Raj,

Things are tough.  People are thinking tomorrow is the day for a lot of layoffs for non-core groups.  

40% chance we merge with Dynegy is what some people are saying.  Bankruptcy is our other option.

The working environment is not good. The firm needs to lay off people now, as opposed to dragging it out.     

I think the good groups will be sold off to the highest bidders, or competitors just buy up all our talented people when the company under.

Any news about your job offer?  Are you looking again?

Mike

Hey Mike!

Hope you had a great thanksgiving weekend. I used it to check out NYC!

Anyway, what's your take on the future of the firm? And how are the
employees reacting so far? It's difficult to recall a weekday when the
WSJ does not carry an
Enron-related article. And now it seems the merger is doubtful.
