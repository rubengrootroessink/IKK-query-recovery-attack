Mark, I wonder whether you will be able to help out on this. Attached is a usage agreement with a company called Altrade Energy System Corp. It is subject to Texas law -wh. I imagine is non-negotiable. Wd someone in yr group be able to look over this for Bo (Bo heads up the NGL group here in Europe).

many tks

Robert
