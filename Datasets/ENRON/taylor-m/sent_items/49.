I'm in London.  I had a 2 week vacation planned with Bill in Greece but he is unable to join me so I think we'll do that another time.  Are you in London?  Germany?  If so do you want company?  Call me at 020 7491 7282, suite 18 or 020 7881 500 471 or reply to this e-mail and Mark will get a message to me.
