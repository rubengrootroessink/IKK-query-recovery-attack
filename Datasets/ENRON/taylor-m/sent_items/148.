Thanks Mark.  I'm not sure who Kim Humbarger is but the topic is at least familiar.  I'll get in touch with her.

Mark

I have an e-mail with an attachment that I cannot forward to you because it is coded in 
Lotus notes as Personal and Confidential.  It is from  Kim Humbarger and the 
Subject line is:   Electronic Signatures on Enron Direct Mass Market Agreements.

I presume you just want me to delete the memo and you will get an original from
Kim.

Mark
