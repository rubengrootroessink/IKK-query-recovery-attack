Joel:

Thanks for your note back.  Unfortunately I don't get into town until quite late on Friday evening so Saturday and Sunday are the only days I can make it.  Do you know yet where you'll be located?

Mark

Dear Mark:

No appointment is needed but Trade Day (Thursday) is usually best/least busy day to come
aboard.  Shall I send you some tickets for that day?  If you would like them please send
me your mailing address.

Best Regards,

I understand that you will have an Amel at the Ft. Lauderdale boat show
next month.  Do I need an appointment to see the boat?
