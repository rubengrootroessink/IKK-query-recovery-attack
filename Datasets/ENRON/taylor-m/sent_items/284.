I think your response is exactly right.  JPMorgan is in complete agreement with
this view and will communicate that to the Fed which has also requested a
meeting with us.  Since our request for a meeting comes from our examiners (and
in view of the past views expressed by some former members of our firm) we will
actually have a meeting--but our message will be the same as yours.

Two weeks ago, a member of the FRBNY legal staff asked to meet with AIG
staff to discuss AIG's present and proposed retail swap activities. I
responded that AIG does not now and has no plans to engage in that activity.
For that reason, I stated that it was premature to consider the need to
regulate an activity that does not now exist and that ought to be the
agencies response to Congress.

     For your information, I have attached correspondence from the
Federal
     Reserve requesting ISDA's participation in the Commodity Futures
     Modernization Act retail swaps study.  The correspondence also lists
     interview topics/questions. Please do not hesitate to call if you
have any
     questions.  Many thanks!   -- Stacy
