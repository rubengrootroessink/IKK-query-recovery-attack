Mark,

We are going to begin distributing a monthly newsletter for EnronOnline. This newsletter will be internal only for distribution to the trading floors including EOL, Enron Traders, Originators, Back & mid-office. There are some minor adjustments to be made to the layout and an additional quote to be added. 

Please let me know your thoughts. If you have any questions, please give me a call.

Thanks,
Lindsay
