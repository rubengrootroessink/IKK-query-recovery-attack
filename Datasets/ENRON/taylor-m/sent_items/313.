Sorry for the delay.  I will be out of town most of this week but could set up a time to talk on the phone if that works for you either Thursday afternoon or Friday morning.  Otherwise, how about Monday August 6 at 10:00, 2:00 or 3:00?

Mark,

Thank you very much for your e-mail I requested.  As it turns out I did not need it for Brad.

Brad did ask me to follow up on two items -- 

Item 1)  Brad was interested if we could share a list of people who visited the site.  So the users would obviously be a subset of this list.  Any thoughts on this matter?  If the customer visits would not work then --

Item 2)  Brad is interested in a workaround.  I shared the idea (at a high level) of a campaign to persuade the users to grant us permission to use their names. Brad wanted to be sure that several points would be addressed with whatever the workaround was.  His concerns are as follows: 1) we want to be as unobtrusive to the EOL customers as possible, 2) in any transaction we need to give the customer value, and 3)  the EOL customers would need to know how we would use the information if they did grant permission to share their data.

Suggested Action:

I would like to meet with you to talk further about any workarounds you might suggest which would address these issues.  After I have a clear understanding of your workaround which addresses the above issues I can then run it by Brad for his approval and then figure out who best to implement.

In this regards do you think we could meet tomorrow at 9:00 a.m. (in your office) for 30 minutes to discuss?  If this time is not convenient for you please counter with some times that are convenient to you.

Thank you 

Jake

Our agreements with EnronOnline customers prohibit us from sharing their names with third parties (i.e. non-Enron companies).  We can use our customer lists ourselves for marketing our products, but can not give the lists to anyone else.
