I told him those ERCs on website were being sold.  We are looking into another deal (bullshit)so we will keep in touch if something comes up.  Price was not brought up.

Cool, what did he say?  Neither John or I will be around so no reason not to roll early.

I am doing her thing on Saturday in the middle of nowhere Texas.  Kind of a compromise.  My thing Thursday.   

John told me to take off as early as I want tomorrow for the drive.  So I think I shall.  I called my boy at San Joaquin.

Atta boy. Probably a good choice. Your girl okay with it?  GHG is a snoozer. Go ahead and call your boy. Tell him we're checking on some things.

I just got back from the greenhouse gas meeting.  The meeting was good. But you will be retired before that program is worth anything as far as a good trading program is concerned. 

John, said he talked with you on the phone about the b-plan.  I added a table of contents, and if John gives me anything to add I will.

I am going home (LA) tomorrow so I might work half a day.

Just to keep up good relations.  I told him we would get back with him.  Please let me know if you do not call him.

I put it in my original message below.  It is 832-496-0123.  Tom Hartman with San Joaquin Power. I imagine a natural.  Are you going to call him today?

Is he a broker or a natural?  I've heard about the company through cantor. He's not going anywhere.  Everyone says they want to move fast then the jack around. You got his number?

I didn't want to talk price with him.  He saw our ERCs (that we just sold for $15,000) on website and called Kevin's line.  I was told to pick up the phone.  I told him somebody would call him back.  Either you or I would if you didn't want to call him.  He wanted to move fast, and he mentioned he used brokers in the past.  

If none are out, I think we should call and tell him.

Who is that and how do you know him?  I haven't seen any come on since we sold some. What was his bid?

I just spoke with Tom Hartman of San Joaquin Power.  He wants up to 20 HGA NOx ERCS.  I told him I would have to check.  He wants to move quickly.  His number is 832-496-0123.  I know we do not have any, but I wanted to see if an arb was possible before we tell him we do not have any.
