Subject:	FW: June Newsletter - NA Energy Committee

I am currently putting together ISDA's June newsletter and thought we needed
to say a bit about the NA Energy Committee.  The following is my submission
- Hoping this is generic yet informative enough for our purposes. -- Stacy

> North American Energy and Developing Products Committee
>
> The Committee plans to meet within the month to discuss various issues
> impacting the OTC energy and developing products markets.  Given the
> increased and varied growth of  ISDA's energy membership, a primary focus
> will include discussion on updating and reconciling provisions of master
> agreements for various energy products.  Market and regulatory issues will
> also be considered.
