Good catch!  I was thinking that Thanksgiving was the 29th -- oops.  I'll get a revised quote.  Any ideas for who wants to go?  This particular boat has three cabins and heads.  If we have another person (Jim?) or couple (the Johns?) we would get along with for a week it would be fun and less expensive.  And if there are even more, we could get a larger boat with four cabins.  We just need to know sooner rather than later to get the boat reserved.

I'm game for a trip.  Any chance we could do it a week or a few days earlier
and take advantage of the Thanksgiving holiday since we are already off?
