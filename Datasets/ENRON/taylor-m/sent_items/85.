Hi Mark,

Attached is a Service Level Agreement for our deal with Global View Software.  Forthcoming will be two attachments - one that gives EOL contact names and numbers and one that outlines the hardware in detail.  I assume that neither will have any bearing on the SLA.  We would like to see it turned around in a week or so if at all possible.  Global View actually has the hardware and we are in the middle of some user acceptance testing.  Please give me a call if any questions.

Thanks,

Fred Philipson
