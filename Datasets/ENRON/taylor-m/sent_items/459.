Under normal circumstances we would not need an Enron Corp. resolution and in fact the Corporate Secretary and Treasury offices can handle moving the money around so we do not propose to do an Enron Corp. Board action unless you folks think it is absolutely necessary.  The other resolutions we can get in place easily.

I think Notre Dame agreement contains restrictions on what we can do with capital stock of subsidiaries after it is signed -- does that mean we need to issue the Golden Share today?
