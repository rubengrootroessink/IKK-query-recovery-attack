Thanks for the offer, but I can't get away that early without taking vacation time.  At this point my flight gets in at 8:36 p.m.

I'm afraid Amanda's friends will be disappointed.  The two-step, a polka or maybe a C&W line dance is more in the Texas line; they'd be disappointed there as well but their expectations might be slightly more reasonable.

If you can get a plane that arrives in newark at 6 - or earlier - ill pick you up in newark on friday. As an added incentive ill take you to the bear cafe in wdstk to eat - it is fabulous.

 Also if you want to bring your tux or your tiara we will store it before the cruise.

I made a massage appointment for you on saturday with this fabulous massage lady. To die for.

Th dj only plays latin/sala music.  Amandas friends think you are going to teach them to dance because you are from houston.
