John:

I recommend that you visit with Mark Taylor on this. I think it's ok as is, but he may recommend a disclaimer be added.

John-Please review asap. This is an invitation for a seminar we are co-hosting with SPI and Plastics USA.  Unfortunately, we had to "marry" our brand identity with two other organizations.  Please make sure content is "legal".  Please call me if you have any questions.  If there is any way we could make this a priority, I'd appreciate it as it was supposed to be mailed last week.  Thanks,
