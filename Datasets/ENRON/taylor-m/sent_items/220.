Launch date set for coal futures trading

The executive committee of the New York Mercantile Exchange has approved a launch date of Thursday, July 12, for the Exchange's Central Appalachian coal futures contract.

Futures: 1,550 tons of coal.

Trading Hours
Open Outcry: 10:30 AM to 2:30 PM

Trading Months
Futures: 24 to 26 consecutive months to be listed on a quarterly schedule.  As contracts expire, the 26th month will roll forward until it becomes the 23rd month.  At that point, new 24th, 25th, and 26th month contracts will be added.

U.S. dollars and cents per ton.

Minimum Price Fluctuation

When trading resumes, expanded limits are in place that allow the price to fluctuate by $24.00 in either direction of the previous day's settlement price. There are no price limits on any month during the last three days of trading in the spot month.

Trading terminates on the fourth to last business day of the month before the delivery month.
