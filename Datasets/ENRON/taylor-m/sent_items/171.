BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP


I am NURA USMAN, a management consultant in the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), I am a member of the Tenders Board a Committee in charge of Contract Awards and Payment Approvals (C A P A). I got your contact during my quest for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account

There were series of contracts executed by a consortium of Multinationals in the oil industry in favor of the (DPR) among which were;

1) The expansion of Pipeline network within Nigeria for crude oil and
downstream products distribution and subsequent evacuation. - USD$2 Billion.
2) Contract for Turn around Maintenance (TAM) at the various Refineries in the country.
3) The construction of Storage Tanks for Petroleum Product (Depots) -USD$94 Million.

The original value of these contracts were deliberately over invoiced to the tune of Thirty Six million, Five Hundred and sixty one thousand United States Dollars (USD$36,561,000.00) which has recently been approved and now ready to be transferred. However the companies that actually executed the aforementioned contract have been fully paid and the project officially commissioned.

Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount to your account for subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau (Civil Service Laws) from opening and/ or operating foreign accounts in our names.

Needless to say, the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous. In return, we have agreed amongst ourselves to offer you 20% of the transferred sum, while 10% shall be set aside for any incidental expenses during the course of this transaction, you will then be mandated to revert the balance 70% to us in due course, or as will be advised in due course.
You must however NOTE that this transaction is subject to the following
terms and conditions; Our conviction of your transparent honesty and
diligence, that you must accord this transaction with utmost confidentiality and secrecy.

Modalities have been worked out at the highest levels of the Ministry of
Finance, Central Bank of Nigeria and the Presidential Task Force on Contract Payment for the immediate remittance of the funds within 10 - 14 working days subject to your satisfaction of the above stated terms. Our assurance is that the risk involved with your role shall be reduced to the barest minimal. To accord this transaction the legality it deserves, and for mutual security of the funds, the whole approval procedures shall be legally processed with your name or any company you may nominate as the bona fide beneficiary of the funds.

Once more, I want you to understand that having put in over 20 years of
meritorious service to my country, I am very much averse to having my image and career dented. This matter should therefore be treated with utmost secrecy and urgency. Kindly expedite action as we are well behind
schedule to enable us include this transfer in the Second quarter of the 2001 fiscal year contractual payments.

Do confirm your interest with a return email to usm2001ng@onebox.com

Thank You.

REGARDS,

NURA USMAN.
