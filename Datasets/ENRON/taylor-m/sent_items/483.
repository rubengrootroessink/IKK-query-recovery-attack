Mark, it looks like we will need a separate Tax id number for ERMT LLC per Stuart.  Do you agree?  Please advise.  Thanks, Deb

Please check with Mark Taylor or the tax guys, but if at all possible we
would like to have a separate EIN for the LLC - don't know if you always
have the same EIN as parent in LLC, but in our instance, the LLC is now
98.04% owned by RMT, and 1.96% owned by ENA.  We need to keep this entity
separate from its parent entities to the extent possible.

The EIN for ERMT LLC will be 76-0539176 which is the same as its parent
company, Risk Management & Trading Corp.  Deb

   Deb - do you know if we have obtained EIN numbers for both ERMT LLC and
   ERMT Corp.?  I assume since we got a bank account we have one for Corp.,
   but didn't know about LLC.  I also assume that the Canadian counsel have
   received the proper tax ID or other info for ERMT Canada Corp.  Also,
   fyi,
   we will be changing the names of the US entities today to "NETCO
   Holdings
   LLC" and "The New Energy Trading Company".  I will check with Mark
   Taylor
   on the Canadian name change.  Thanks.
