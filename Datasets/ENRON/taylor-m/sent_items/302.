What should we do about keeping track of names, phone numbers etc. for me?  Is it time to start with one of the programs now available?

I received all the paperwork from you, thanks. Just as a note, the reason I
didn't receive the first package is due to a wrong address. My current
address is 666 5th Ave, NYC, NY 10103.I do need one more signature from
you.I will e-mail the form and you can fax it back to me. My fax # is
212-765-1057. Thanks. JL
