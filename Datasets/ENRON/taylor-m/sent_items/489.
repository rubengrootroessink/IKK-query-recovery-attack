I can get the NETCO document signed but don't know anything about CGNN.  Who should I give that to?

Would you please prepare a form of agreement for ERMT LLC?  We would like
to get both signed up today.  Note that we are changing ERMT LLC's name to
NETCO Holdings LLC.

Thanks,
Trish.

Dear Trish:

Attached is a draft of our Services  Agreement for CGNN Holding Company,
Inc.  If this form is acceptable I will  draft a similar agreement for ERMT
LLC (modified to include the non-economic  member).

The independent director for ERMT LLC will  be Bernard J. Angelo and the
golden shareholder will be GSS Contract Services I,  Inc., a Delaware
corporation.

Please feel free to call me with any  questions or comments that you may
have.

Best regards.
