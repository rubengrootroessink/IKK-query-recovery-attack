IMPORTANT NOTICE - Reply Requested
 
 

MEMORANDUM TO ISDA MEMBERS
 

ISDA is in the process of updating its records to ensure that we have the most current information for members in our database.  To continue with its electronic initiatives that began last year, ISDA will increasingly provide information notices, comment letters, committee meeting notices and other correspondence by email or through its web site. In addition, ISDA plans to enhance its web site to allow members to customize their view of the web site so they can select the information that is most relevant to them. More details on this enhanced web feature will follow later this year.  Your correct details, particularly your email address, are required in order for you to remain informed of ISDA initiatives and developments in the derivatives industry.  
 
ISDA committees are the principal means of informing members of developments in areas of their responsibility or interest.  Careful consideration should be given to the list of committees attached before you make your selection. If you do not respond to this request or if you do not indicate that you wish to be on an ISDA committee, you will not receive notices on ISDA committee activities.  You will continue to receive the ISDA newsletter and conference information only.
 
Enclosed are the details we have on file for you.  Please confirm that your details are correct or make changes if necessary, and reply by email to database@isda.org by July 28, 2001. 
 
Please contact Barbara Hanlon by email at bhanlon@isda.org or by telephone on 212 332 1200 should you have any question.
