Mark

I have a commodity futures account in which I only trade cattle and grain
futures, no energy.

Subject:  Enron North America Corp. NYMEX Hedge Exemption Applications


We  are  in  the  process  of  preparing  applications  for  position limit
exemptions  for  ENA's  NYMEX  energy  commodities  futures trading.  These
applications  require  that  ENA represent whether its officers, employees,
owners,  or  agents  have  a power of attorney, control or have a financial
interest  in any related commodity future(s) account either individually or
acting with another person pursuant to express or implied agreement.

Please  direct  any responses to my paralegal, Tana Jones, via intercompany
email or call her at (713) 853-3399 by the end of business on June 15, 2001
if  you have any power of attorney, control or have a financial interest in
any commodity futures account (other than an ENA or other trading affiliate
account).

IF  YOU DO NOT HAVE A COMMODITY FUTURES ACCOUNT, YOU DO NOT NEED TO RESPOND
TO THIS REQUEST.
