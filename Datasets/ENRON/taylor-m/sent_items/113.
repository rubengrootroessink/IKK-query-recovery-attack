Thanks Vela.  My office address is fine.

Just so you know ahead of time what some of my questions will be:

1.  I'm a little concerned about the safety of in-mast furling systems generally.  What happens if it jams in a blow?
2.  Are the heads both electric?  Will they operate manually if you lose power?
3.  The boat seems remarkably well equipped.  What sorts of additional items are usual to purchase before she's ready to cruise?
4.  How do U.S. owners deal with the voltage issues and electrical repairs and replacements?
5.  Finally, and I suppose of least importance, I'm not thrilled with the teak-look deck or the blue cabin sole.  Any hope of a manufacturing change?

Thanks again and I'm looking forward to seeing you in Ft. Lauderdale!

Mark

Joel:

Thanks for your note back.  Unfortunately I don't get into town until
quite late on Friday evening so Saturday and Sunday are the only days I
can make it.  Do you know yet where you'll be located?

Mark
