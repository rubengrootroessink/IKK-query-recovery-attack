Subject:=09Merger Agreement

Attached is an electronic version of the Merger Agreement that we executed =
with Dynegy.  As is typical with these types of transactions, there are lim=
itations imposed on Enron's operations between signing and closing of the M=
erger Agreement.  Please help ensure that each transaction entered into by =
Enron and its subsidiaries complies with the agreement, and particularly Se=
ction 7.1 of the agreement relating to conduct of business.  Peter del Vecc=
hio (at ext. 39875) and Joe Henry (at ext. 51549) are available to help add=
ress specific questions regarding our interim operations.  Rob Walls, John =
Ale, Mark Haedicke and myself are also available, and we will help determin=
e if we need Dynegy's consent for any particular proposed transaction.  We =
are in the process of summarizing the interim covenants, as well as establi=
shing certain procedures to ensure our compliance.  I anticipate distributi=
ng these items on Thursday.  We are also having prepared a memorandum regar=
ding certain anti-trust and other issues that we need to consider in any in=
volvement we have with Dynegy regarding our respective operations.  We curr=
ently plan on having various presentations regarding the anti-trust matters=
.  Please pass the merger agreement and the subsequent materials on to othe=
rs in your group as you think appropriate.  Thank you for your help and und=
erstanding in this matter.  Lance.
