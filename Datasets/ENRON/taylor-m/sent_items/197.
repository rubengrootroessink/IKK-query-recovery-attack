Veronica - The a/c people didn't make it Saturday because off the flooding.  They called yesterday to reschedule and will be there this coming Saturday morning sometime after 8:00.  Let me know if you won't be around so I can let them in.

Mark

               	Mark,   Do you have a number where I can call the technician in regards to checking the a/c system?  I don't know whether I need to make arrangements or if you will.  Please advise.   Regards,  Veronica Brock
