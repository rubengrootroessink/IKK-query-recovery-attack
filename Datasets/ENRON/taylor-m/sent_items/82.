Mark-

I am one of the editors for the Exchange Newsmagazine (the EWS external customer publication).  It is approval time and Legal needs to sign off on this article on business web sites.  If you are not the appropriate person to read and approve this, please direct me to the right one.  I need this back by Friday, Sept. 28, if possible.

Thank you.
