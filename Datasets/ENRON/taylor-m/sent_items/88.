Is P&G approved to trade derivatives online?

I have run the reports again this morning and we do not have any deals with Proctor & Gamble that were concluded online.

I have run some report queries and it appears that although they have read the ETA and have about 10 users they have never traded online.  I will run the report again tomorrow morning when it is quieter on the system to be doubly sure.

Thanks

If you have ever traded cash-settled commodity or weather derivatives with this entity, please would you let me know

Thanks
