Mark,

Please review the attached description for a location to be added to the US Pwr Fin Swap (Weather Desk) and make the changes you feel necessary.  I will be building a location in TEST in order to test the bridging of the new location.  If you feel we need to meet to discuss this, please let me know and I will set an appointment with you.

Thank you.
Kevin
