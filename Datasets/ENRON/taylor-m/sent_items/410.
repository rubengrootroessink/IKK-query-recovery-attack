Just to let you guys know... I'm working like an animal here but at least I'm still employed.  Every now and then I kinda wish I'd been one of those laid off last week instead of the one who had to tell people they were no longer employed but I don't have enough to retire on any more so I guess I still need the job!  Hope you guys are doing well.  Any plans for New Years?
