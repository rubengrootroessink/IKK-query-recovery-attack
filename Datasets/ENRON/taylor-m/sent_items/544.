I didn't want to talk price with him.  He saw our ERCs (that we just sold for $15,000) on website and called Kevin's line.  I was told to pick up the phone.  I told him somebody would call him back.  Either you or I would if you didn't want to call him.  He wanted to move fast, and he mentioned he used brokers in the past.  

If none are out, I think we should call and tell him.

Who is that and how do you know him?  I haven't seen any come on since we sold some. What was his bid?

I just spoke with Tom Hartman of San Joaquin Power.  He wants up to 20 HGA NOx ERCS.  I told him I would have to check.  He wants to move quickly.  His number is 832-496-0123.  I know we do not have any, but I wanted to see if an arb was possible before we tell him we do not have any.

I understand.  I am not the one holding you up.  I printed out both documents for him to read.  John doesn't take commands from me.  I will make any revisions he has made on his printed copies tomorrow.

I think he looked at the preso and maybe 25% of the b-plan.  We did not talk about it, yet.  He said it looked good, but he got bored so he stopped reading.  He may be waiting for you to come back in town to discuss.  I told him you would be back Monday.  That is the latest.
