I think Sara Shackleton was the last Enron lawyer to have worked on this.

I was just speaking with Jan Aspuru - Director of their Fuel Services Division - and he tells me that they have not been able to get their ISDA completed with Enron and therefore have been doing all their swaps business with MS and Goldman. He said they have a 10 year coal purchase agreement and buy natural gas from us, but the ISDA had gotten bogged down between legal teams. I don't know what the legal issue is and neither did he, but his attorneys told him that whatever language we wanted in (which our attys said was minor) his attys felt was a major change - plus neither MS nor Goldman required the same language. Since they don't need the change for them, they see no reason to agree to it with us.

Since I'm not familiar with your group, could you tell me who is handling this so Jan and I can understand the issue a little better? Thanks,
