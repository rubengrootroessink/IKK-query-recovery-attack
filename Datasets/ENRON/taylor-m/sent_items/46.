Thank you for relaying the message.
We are all riveted to the news as well.  From a window down the hall, I saw the second trade tower collapse.  It is truly horrible.  Many people have left the office, but those who live outside of Manhattan are stuck here.  I'm still here, waiting to hear the whereabouts of my husband who was en route to court in Brooklyn this morning, before walking home to the upper west side.
Be well.

Hi Kayalyn - Linda asked me to forward this - I'm at my company's office
in London.

Am unable to call NYC from London - all lines busy.  I received your fax
and it looks fine.  I don't understand the last sentence of section 6.3
because of the cross reference to section 10.3.  Please check the cross
reference to section 10.3.  Thanks.

Linda

p.s. -- if you can get through you can reach me at:
Hotel - 44 (207)491-7282 (phone)
44 (207)491-7281 (fax)
Cell phone 44 7881 500 471

Hope everyone is ok - we are watching on CNN.
