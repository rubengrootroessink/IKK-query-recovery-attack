Let's go ahead and make her an offer to start as soon as she can - that may not be until September but if she can make it sooner that would be great.

Everyone I've talked to was thoroughly impressed.  I'd be happy to proceed but did get an e-mail from Cheryl on Friday indicating she wanted to talk about it...not sure yet what that means.  I'm out of town today and tomorrow - if you have time to stop by Cheryl's office & ask, that might help.  My only concern with Kim at all is that she probably can't start until September.  Probably worth the wait though.

Mark,

What was the feedback on Kim?  Sorry about the HR mixup on the scheduling sheet that indicated that she was to work for me.  Cheryl Nelson interviewed her without knowing the real opportunity was for your group.  Oops.

Let me know how you would like me to proceed.

Michelle
