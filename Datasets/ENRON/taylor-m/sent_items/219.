I got your message and the e-mail.  I'll be happy to go pick them up.  Once I have them I'll let you know and we can arrange for you to get them.

Here is the filled in form.  I will sign when I return to the office.  Mark
Taylor is my supervisor and I left a message asking if he could pick up the
checks for me.
Thanks,
Brent Hendry
