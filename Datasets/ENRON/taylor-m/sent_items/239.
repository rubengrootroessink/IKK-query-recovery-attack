Yes, I was working with Justin Boyd and Ian Brungs in the legal dept. I think they sent the revisions to Arfan.

Mark,

Please let me know when you hear back from the EOL people.
I am assuming London EOL people (?) because the Houston EOL people (Rob Cass / Kevin Meredith) were not yet aware of any forthcoming changes.
I just wanted to make sure that the Houston EOL team also stays up to date so that they can make changes too on our Houston EOL system.

Thanks,
Homer

We agreed from a legal perspective and sent the language along to the EOL people to make sure that it works on the system.  I haven't heard back.

Subject:	Standardization of Tanker Freight Swap product description

Mark,

I am assuming that you are back from your London trip.

Was there success in the standardization of the Tanker Freight Swap product description?
Or was it agreed to keep the product description differentiated regionally?  
If global standardization has been implemented, has Carlos Alatorre been notified yet about any necessary changes?  

I am just checking to see where we are now to see what needs to be done next.

Thanks,
Homer
