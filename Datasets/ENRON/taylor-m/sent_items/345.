I was under the impression that no confirmations were sent by e-mail. All of our derivatives transactions are confirmed by fax and the vast majority of physical commodity transactions are as well.  There are a very few which are not confirmed at all but I don't know of any that involve e-mail.

Mark, this is the tagline to which I referred in my voicemail.  Jeff said that the non-EOL confirms go out by fax, so the tagline doesn't appear, but our EOL confirms go out by e-mail.

Tony has been working on this problem for us.  I'll ask him to give you a call to let you know what the status is.  Thanks Jean.  df

Drew -- I was wondering if you could point me in the right direction.

I am working with Ranelle Paldino on an issue... This message (shown below) is at the bottom of each of our email messages sent outside Enron.  Craig Buehler sends Contract info via email.  I was attempting to get approval to get this taken off Craig's email messages.  The Corp Messaging team pointed me to Legal.    Thanks.  Jean  x51615
