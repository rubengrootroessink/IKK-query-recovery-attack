We've actually completed this as far as I know -- negotiated the agreement and signed it last week.

Hello Suzanne,

I received a message stating that Mark Taylor would prefer that the NatWest
ISDA Master Agreement survive.  We agree.  Enclosed please find a revised
Assignment Agreement for your perusal.  Please note that the novation is
scheduled for October 26, 2001, therefore time is of the essence.  Should
you have any questions, feel free to contact me.  My contact details are
listed below.

Regards,

Diane
