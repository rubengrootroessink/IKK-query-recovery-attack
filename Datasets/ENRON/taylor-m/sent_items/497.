Thanks for your note.  I've been thinking about you guys a lot, too.  I haven't been back to NYC since I left on the QE2 on 9/4.  Every time I heard about the conditions downtown I assumed you would be living in the country.  Sorry to hear you had to spend so much time in a hotel.  I know what that can be like and it loses any appeal it ever had very quickly.  Also sorry to hear about Mrs. B.  I hope she is doing better.

It has been chaotic and very depressing here -- not that our acquisition deal went through but that we ever got in the position to need the deal to go through in the first place.  In fact, when they finally announced it, my primary feeling was one of relief.  Things had gotten very bad.  Next time we get together I can fill you in on all the details.  At least for now I am still employed and my prospects are pretty good under the circumstances.

It's nice you have Key West to get away to.  You'll have to tell me about the house that you have available but under the circumstances I doubt that I could get away often enough to justify taking on a lease.  It would be nice to get away from here now and then though.  I was supposed to go to Ft. Lauderdale (did you know Ted was living there now?) a few weeks ago to visit and go to the big boat show there.  That trip had to be cancelled in all the confusion around here.  I had hoped to be in New York today for a seminar (where I was actually scheduled to speak) but cancelled that also.  With luck things will start to get back to normal here soon.  I'm really feeling the need for a break (and 4 days in Cincinnati next week don't count) so maybe I can come visit some time in the next couple of months.

Tell Don I said Hi.

Mark

Mark,
You have been in mind for days, longer in fact.  Every time I read about
Enron I think of you, and life has been scattered so I have not been able to
write.

Since the news now seems to be that your company is being bought by another,
it must be chaotic for you.  Let me know how you are and what is happening.
No doubt you will survive the mess, but hope it is not taking too much out
of you.

We are slowly getting back to normal, and every trip out of NY it great as I
am very tired of police check points and ID's.  Our building is livable now
for about a month, but still behind a barricade.  My mother has been in and
out of hospital, and so that has kept me stressed.  I sold a house in KW in
late Sept, so came down then for the closing.  Hated going back to NY as we
were still living in a hotel then....

I am in KW now, much enjoying being able to work here but missing Don.  Back
to NY next week, then here again end of month.  Planning a new addition on
the house, which is trying.  The little house next door is coming up for
rent as of Dec 1, in case you are interested, and I have decided to only
rent it to a single guy...Maybe you need a little winter getaway??

All best,
Hal
