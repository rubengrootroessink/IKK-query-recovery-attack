This is the current incarnation of project offline.  They are trying to find customers who would like us to set up and operate a version of EOL for them.  I think Anne has been the point person for them.  It is not related to the back office deal.

Mark -

Do you know anything about a "EnronOnline Private eMarketplace solution" that is being marketed?  Is this the same as the back office/off-line deals?

Mike Bridges sent me a document to review concering this matter and needs me to respond.

Thanks.

Mark
