no your arkansas ticket went to waste. i am hoping mom and michelle will come to this game.  mom can probably use nick's ticket and kerry may be able to use amanda's ticket and id if she doesn't go.  i will know for sure by like wed.  i don't know if mom will even come or not.  anyway i will buy one if someone calls me for you. 

love

 Kelly
