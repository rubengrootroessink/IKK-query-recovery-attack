My flight doesn't get in until 10:30 or so on Friday night.  Not sure what we can still do for food at that hour.  Do people eat late in Ft. Lauderdale?  In case you're still looking for food ideas, I found these that looked interesting:


Bistro Mezzaluna
Armadillo Cafe (Davie)
Left Bank
Hobo's Fish Joint (Coral Springs)
Darrel & Olivers Cafe Maxx (Pompano Beach)

Not sure but I think the first two may be reasonably close to the airport, the next one in Fort Lauderdale but have no idea where the last two are.  All get good marks in Zagats.  Look them up at zagats.com and see what you think.
