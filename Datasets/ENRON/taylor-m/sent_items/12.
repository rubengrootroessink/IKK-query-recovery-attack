Darren, I am on vacation so to resolve the last outstanding issues, Mark Taylor will reassign this file since it is very active and but for the need to make the last changes to the guaranty, I believe that we are otherwise ready to move forward.   I will not be reachable tomorrow -- traveling all day so can you touch bases with the counterparty to let her know that I am on vacation but someone else will move the file forward?  I will call in Friday to see if any one has any questions.

Please make sure that other commodities are included, such as Emissions.  As well, other PPL entities.  I believe the form originally sent to me earlier today covered this.  thks

      Agreed. Please orchestrate consolidation of Enron Corp Guaranty
$'s for the following.

      At present PPL EnergyPlus holds the following enhancements.

      for EMPI    $30.0MM dated 4/23/99 and amended to $30.00 effective
3/13/01

      for E NA    $7.0M dated 8/1/99 and amended 8/1/99 which expired on
7/31/2001  ( kind reminder to extend)

      for E NA for financial transactions linked to  an ISDA (I believe)
date 3/21/2001 $15.0MM

      any questions please call

Al,
I think that Enron and PPL should replace all previous guaranties with
$30MM documents covering the ISDA, Master Power Agreement and any
additional physical gas business as well. Please let me know if the
dollar amount is agreeable.
