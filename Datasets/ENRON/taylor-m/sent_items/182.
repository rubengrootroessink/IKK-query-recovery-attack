Hope this is of some use... this is the history of the project before it fe=

In an effort to get the concept off the ground here in the States, particul=
arly Houston, to that of equal extent presently being experienced in London=
, we need to come up with a marketing/educational assault on the States mar=
ket. When attempted in the past, we found the concept was heavily resisted =
by die-hard crude traders and vessel owners. The biggest complaint, other t=
han sheer stupidity on anything futures related, was that no one had any fa=
ith or could agree on a pricing index.  Fortunately, the market is starting=
 to see some spurts in this direction overseas and can expect the same here=
 shortly.

When reading the above chart, you will find the various voyages that are as=
sessed daily by the Baltic Exchange.  This report comes out every day at 11=
:00 AM New York. While anyone in the biz can become a member of the exchang=
e, the rates are assessed by a panel consisting of brokers ONLY; a total of=
 8 different brokerage firms that more or less look at the tanker market ac=
tivity for the day and average what has been reported as done.  The tanker =
market, for the most part, is very transparent. =20

1 in Norway
1 in France
1 in the U.S.
5 in London

As you can see, it is more popular in London.  This relates to the exact sa=
me concept that has been around for years as it pertains to the Dry freight=
 market.

The market that we wish to begin concentrating on in Houston would be the T=
9 route -  70,000 MT loads Puerto La Cruz (P.L.C.) and discharges Corpus Ch=
risti - described as caribs to USG.

The flat rate (ws100) published by WorldScale (ws) for the year 2001 actual=
 voyage P.L.C. to corpus is 5.10 p/mt.  As u can see by the last posting (M=
ay 11th) for route T9, the exchange is calling it a ws162 market ....If you=
 did a deal whereby you called and sold the month of Mays average at ws190 =
and the market stayed at the 160's level you would be making 30 points on t=
he 5.10 p/mt flat which =3D 1.53 p/mt x 70,000 mt cargo =3D 107,100 USD; vi=
ce versa if you bought at ws 190.

The initial attraction for Houston in this market is the same reason London=
 trades T7 ( North Sea to Cont).  We have a trading department here that sh=
ould have a solid understanding of the short haul crude oil markets as it p=
ertains to their screen trades and to how it will effect freight.  In addit=
ion, we recently ourselves have had more activity in the short haul crude m=
arket particularly with 2 recent purchases of Columbian stems.

90% of the chartering for this market is done in the States and 75% of the =
international owners have commercial representation in the States.

Route T9 has the volatility to swing from ws 155 to ws 315 over a months ti=
me - contributing factors that effect market swings are the same as any mar=
ket when broken down.  For example:

Supply/Demand Scenarios - assume there are 25 stems in a month and only 23 =
boats that can make the different dates, and if only 10 of those boats are =
acceptable by the majors (or anyone else that is worried about spill liabil=
ity sanctions), combined with a herd mentality that trades on a "last done"=
 philosophy combined with panic and weather delays particularly in EC Mexic=
o where 10-day turnaround voyages can increase to 20 days.

70,000 MT of crude is more commonly known in shipping as the 500,000 bbl ma=
rket.  Basic API gravity conversion for crude is 7.33 bbls p/mt hence 7.33 =
x 70,000 mt =3D 513,000 bbls.

This size vessel dominates the short haul crude market (caribs to usg) (whe=
re the refineries are) because they are the biggest boats you can get into =
most of the terminals due to physical restrictions such as draft, LOA, etc.=
..  This not only enables the majors to get their crude right in, but allow=
s the traders more flexibility to sell the cargos delivered to a wider rang=
e of buyers.  When the big boats (VLCC's) (very large crude carriers) (usua=
lly 2 million bbl plus boats) come to the USG from the Persian Gulf, West A=
frica, North Sea, etc.. they park off at Anchorage and then are lightered o=
r off loaded to 70,000 mt boats to then bring the crude in.  (I apologize i=
f this is remedial for any readers)  In any event, when the USG sees a surg=
e in big ships coming west to the states, the 70,000 mt boats get sucked up=
 by the lighterage companies enabling the short haul crude market boats to =
get tight which means rates will swing hard.  Currently it is a weak market=
 at the 70 x ws 160 level.

On average there are approximately 30 physical cargos p/month for the carib=
s, or the T9 route.  For the most part the breakdown is as follows :

Mexico (Cayo Arcas, Pajaritos,) Mayan ,Isthmus, Olmeca crude - mainly domin=
ated by shell who have the processing deal with the Mexicans where they del=
iver them cpp from the USG.  Citgo has a few, as does Valero who will proba=
bly have more with recent acquisition of Diamond Shamrock Refining, Orion, =
Coastal, Fina, Conoco, Koch, Chevron etc. =20

Venezuela (Puerto la Cruz, Amuay, Puerto Miranda, la Salina, Bajo grande) e=
tc. players are PDV, Lyondell, BP, Exxon/Mob, Conoco, Orion, Coastal etc..

Columbia -  same players

(We certainly have the resources here for more exact figures and breakdowns=
.)

Why would this work here in the States? With the recent surge in volatility=
, a lot of the above mentioned physical players have had their ass's handed=
 to them.  Freight is becoming a more crucial part of crude oil trading.  S=
ome of the bigger players have already put into place forms of hedges such =
as contact of affreightments (C.O.A.'s).  For example, Lyondell has a C.O..=
A. with 3 different owners to provide 2 ships per month (that totals 6 move=
s p/mo.) for 2 years.  The freight rates are settled off a 1 to 5 point for=
mula off Mardata (Lloyds register) which they in turn can hedge with Online=
.=20

Owners - who for the most part are always going to try to be bullish - if h=
ave an understanding of hedges could have interest for stabilizing cash flo=
ws.  Quite possibly Origination or Marketing could assist in promoting it t=
o the market - unfortunately, for me to speak to anyone outside of shipping=
 in another company would hurt me with their freight people who I have to d=
eal with on physical vessel trading.  In addition, the freight people are n=
ot going to have the authority or descision capabilities to trade on line t=
hat trading Department Heads might have.

In- house freight books as is the case with Scott and myself experienced mu=
ch more activity in 2000 then what we have seen thus far in 2001, A combine=
d result of a smaller time charter fleet this year and declining tanker rat=
es which makes it difficult to go long freight in the spot market as well a=
s limited exposure to the spot market as a result of no longer having any s=
upply contracts here in Houston as when we had 2 jet stems, 2 gas oil stems=
 and 2 mogas stems p/month with the vens. In addition we had more spot biz =
with trinidad and columbia and several supply commitments in West Coast S.A=
merica.  Im confident if the EOL Tanker freight took off  we would once aga=
in be able to experience the same success we have seen each year thus far i=
n ship trading by increasing our presence in the markets.

The U.S. broker MJLF, particularly Bob Flynn, has been trying to get this o=
ff the ground now for over 5 years and even had an unsuccessful JV with Cit=
ibank.  Reason being, Citibank wasn't calling the market but was interested=
 in it from a commission standpoint (as was the case with mjlf) but setting=
 up avenues of hedges for ship building and vessel ownership.  FIynn presen=
tly has a seller for 2 voyages p/month starting in July.  The pricing would=
 be the first 5 days and last 5 days of each month at ws 190 - he has a bid=
 of 160 - so there's a lot of middle ground to get this done.  This is alwa=
ys the case and is why in the States there have only been about 2 deals con=
cluded overall.
Flynn, whose motivation is commissions, can be viewed as either a competito=
r of ours or instrumental in helping us with establishment.  For it would b=
e in his best interest for there to be high activity, and as he is the only=
 one presently in the States to have a seller or bid I feel he would be eas=
y to manipulate and as stated before he is part of the panel.  If this was =
to take off to the level that Enron has taken other markets -- whereby futu=
res rates are nowhere near indicative of physical freight and trades are be=
ing done off of different pricing scenarios i.e.- months average- specific =
day close's, first half/2nd half, etc -- if it became so big that sellers w=
eren't just owners and bids weren't just charterers but more of a global bo=
ok balancing tool, who knows what can be done.  The last time we tried to g=
et this going was last year when we had an analyst named Sameer in the grou=
p who was coordinating the launch with Louise Kitchen; I believe it lost mo=
mentum with legal.  Since London has been able to get it going under the di=
rection of Scott Moncrieff we should also be able to offer it here.  Scott =
advises me that he has the support/infrastructure that enables him to still=
 cover the physical freight markets as it applies to the product traders as=
 well as the global freight market and ship arbitrage opportunities that we=
 both follow now.

I would appreciate any advice or guidance on what would be the best way to =
pursue this and get it on the website. I am by no means trying to pass the =
buck here and am available to anyone who might need some insight to the fre=
ight markets be it technical or commercial and welcome the idea of a explai=
ning worldscale and volatility as im sure is the case with Scott in London.
