I hope all of your loved ones and friends are OK.  

I'm obviously not able to get back to Houston today as originally planned.  Continental has me booked on a flight on Sunday -- assuming they're back up to full schedule by then -- so I plan to be back in the office on Monday morning.  I will continue to work from the London office and you can reach me at 011-44-207-783-6468 at the office (but I can't get voicemail here) or on the cell phone 011-44-7881-512-535 (where I am able to check messages).  I will also be checking voicemail in Houston from time to time.

I know it's hard to think about work issues much less concentrate, but it seems to me we need to start thinking about market disruption issues right away.  The NYMEX is the obvious issue and we need to find out which counterparties have affected transactions (such as using average of the entire month of NYMEX prices) and then review the relevant documentation.  With any luck there won't be many.  We also need to be alert to other price sources that might fail to publish.

I'll be in touch.
