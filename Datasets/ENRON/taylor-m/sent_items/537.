Not much said about our group, except he has a direct line to Walley and has spoken with Dynegy.  He feels like they are excited to get us and that they mentioned "that they are good at being number 2."  He also mentioned a few companies have asked if the coal group was for sale as a whole.  He listened but told them no thanks.  Sounds like a few small changes in our group but nothing drastic.  George did say we have working capital (we didn't for 2 days).  Not sure if that means coal or coal and emissions.

Didn't specify what groups will be hit the hardest, he only said EGM and EIM. 

Oh, by the way my job offers are pouring as well.  To many to count!!!!!  It is hard to do work with all the head hunters calling him every hour.  Oh wait, just kidding!

Makes sense. I'm sure he does. I've got 3 my self and there is a larger need for experienced coal traders. What groups will be hit hardest and did he provide any specifics about our group?
