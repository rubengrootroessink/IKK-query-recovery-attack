Duke University football practice was delayed for two hours yesterday in the midst of what was an anthrax scare. One of the players, while on his way to the locker room, happened to look down and notice a unknown white powdery substance on the practice field. Third-year Blue Devils head coach Carl Franks immediately suspended practice while the FBI was called in to investigate. After a complete field analysis, the FBI determined that the white substance unknown to the players was the goal line. Practice was resumed when FBI special agents decided that the Blue Devils, winless in their last 22 games, would not be likely to encounter the substance ever, ever again.
