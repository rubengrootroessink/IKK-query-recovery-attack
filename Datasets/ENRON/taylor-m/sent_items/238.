Dale - 

I know you are getting frustrated with the delay on counterparty approvals.  We have asked Stephanie Panus, one of the other paralegals in the group, to get started on this process and hope that that will speed things along.  Tana is in the process of showing her the ropes and I am hopeful that they will make significant progress by the end of the week.

Mark - 

May we ask that there be some concentration on the dated items; which are almost a month in the queue. I am certain that our phones will be ringing again soon.
