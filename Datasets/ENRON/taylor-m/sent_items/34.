Mark -

Sorry for the delay on the CommodityLogic information.  We completed a few documents today and I wanted to make sure you had the final versions.  Also, FYI, Tom has a meeting with Greg on Monday to discuss the creation of a separate CommodityLogic entity.  He has invited me to attend.  Please let me know if you want to attend or have any issues or items you want addressed.

Below are the latest versions of the CL documents.  Let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Mark
