Veronica,

The lease automatically converts to a month-to-month lease at the beginning of August at the same rent.  That means that from then on either one of us can cancel with 30 days notice to the other if they want to.  That's ok with me if it works for you.

Mark

Mark,

Have you made a decision on the lease and rent increase/decrease?  Please
advise.  Thanks!
