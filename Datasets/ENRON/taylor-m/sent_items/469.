Thanks  Stuart, I'll add it in.  Two other questions -- should the performance of the services be delayed until requested at a later date (there isn't much need for it today) and what do we do about the fees?

We can say the following:

Provision of office space, which may include office space in the current
principal offices of the Administrator or such other location in Houston,
Texas or other location as Adminstrator may occupy, and such other office
space as may be reasonably required by ERMT from time to time during the
term of this Agreement.

Let me know if you want me to add this or if you are going to do it on your
end - Thanks.

One more thing we need to consider is office space.  Can I just add that in
as a "service"?

   Attached is a revised services agreement to reflect your comments - you

   Net
   Works, so that will need to confirmed.  Please let me know if you have
   any
   further thoughts or comments on the attached.  Thanks.
