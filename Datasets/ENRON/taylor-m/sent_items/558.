Kelly,

I am going to use my Auburn ticket this weekend.  I am also trying to find one for Kerry and an ID.  Any tickets?  Also, people may be calling you to sell a ticket for $10.  I e-mailed them off of Universitytools.com.    Last time I used Mindy's ID which may work again.

Did anybody use my Ark ticket?

Mike
