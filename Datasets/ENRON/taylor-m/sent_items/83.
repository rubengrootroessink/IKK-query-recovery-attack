The first one looks ok to me as long as someone has checked the accuracy of the reference to Gas Daily.

I have trouble with the second one.  This really looks like a basis swap so I think we need to start with basis swap language.  Can you call me on this one?

Mark,

Please see the 2 new Gas Daily indexes requested by Pete Keavey. He is considering replacing the existing HeHub products with this new electronic trading index.  Let us know if the language looks OK.

Thanks,
