Do we need to do a review of American Airlines credit? They sent their ISDA schedule to us and I sent it to legal - Mark Taylor is asking where we stand. I'm attaching the schedule - please let Mark and I know about credit status. Thanks,

Geraldine,

Attached is a preliminary draft of Schedule to ISDA Master for Enron.  I have assumed that we would be trading only fuels with them and have drafted the ISDA accordingly.
