David,

Thanks for your note.  Glad to hear you and yours are well.  

We docked in Southampton on Monday morning so I was already in our London office on Tuesday and just back from lunch when the news started coming through.  I was traveling with a couple of friends from NYC (Amanda McGovern, Noble Black's UVA classmate, and Linda Hayman, her mom and a friend of mine from my Skadden days) so it was rather tense for a while as we tried to find their friends but everyone came through pretty well.  Our return had been scheduled for Wednesday of that week so of course we were stranded in London but made it back Sunday.  Not that we were having much fun, but there were worse places to be stranded.  I felt bad for the QE2 passengers on their way from Southampton to NYC.  They would have gotten the news on their first day at sea and had to spend what should have been a pleasant cruise thinking about events and worrying.

I've heard good things from both Anne and Brad about your meeting here in Houston.  Thanks for getting into that.  It sounds like exactly what we needed.  I have been talking to Barbara and she will check with Frank concerning the letter.

I'll look forward to chatting sometime soon so I can hear what's been happening with you and how you are coping.  Hope it is all going as smoothly as possible.  Linda tells me that New York is a changed place -- nearly empty evenings and weekends.

Mark

Mark,

First off, I hope that your family and friends are all well.  I feel very
lucky in that my family, friends and colleagues are all okay.  I kept
thinking about you and wasn't sure if you were stuck on the ship at the
time.  What happened - how did you get back?

On a more mundane, although important, note I thought I would update you on
some recent events.

We had a great meeting a few weeks back with Anne Koehler, Brad Richter and
Rex Shelby.  We helped them consider the various legal and practical issues
that would face Enron should you chose to host internet sites for customers
(as opposed to licensing the software to a company and letting them host
their own sites).  As it turns out, the business team decided to do some
more analysis before proceeding.

Pam Kavieff has asked us for help with eProjects (online auction sites for
construction projects) and we have provided documents to her team.

Barbara Gray has also asked for help on a project involving AEP.  I think
she wanted to clear this with you.

In that regard, I just confirmed with my assistant that I did not receive a
signed fee letter back from Frank Sayer ( I had sent one to him after we
meet with him several months ago).  We can either try to find that letter
and see if Frank signed it (or have him sign it) or I can send a new letter
to your attention.  In fairness to you, there may be a few things you need
to review (e.g., fax, copying charges come to mind).

Best regards,

David
