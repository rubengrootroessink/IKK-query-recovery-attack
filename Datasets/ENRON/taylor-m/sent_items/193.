     Subject:  Enron North America Corp. NYMEX Hedge Exemption Applications


     We  are  in  the  process of preparing applications for position limit
     exemptions  for ENA's NYMEX energy commodities futures trading.  These
     applications   require   that  ENA  represent  whether  its  officers,
     employees, owners, or agents have a power of attorney, control or have
     a financial interest in any related commodity future(s) account either
     individually  or  acting  with  another  person pursuant to express or
     implied agreement.

     Please   direct  any  responses  to  my  paralegal,  Tana  Jones,  via
     intercompany  email  or  call  her  at  (713)  853-3399  by the end of
     business  on  June 15, 2001 if you have any power of attorney, control
     or  have  a financial interest in any commodity futures account (other
     than an ENA or other trading affiliate account).

     IF  YOU  DO  NOT  HAVE A COMMODITY FUTURES ACCOUNT, YOU DO NOT NEED TO
     RESPOND TO THIS REQUEST.
