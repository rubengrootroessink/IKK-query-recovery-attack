Paul,

Can we get a breakdown of how much Enron gives to soccer and what does it pay for?

Subject:	referee question

A proposal has been brought forward regarding next season:
Do we want to have 3 refs at the game (ie, a referee and 2 linesmen)?
The cost would increase from $20 a game to $60ish a game.

Some teams have suggested that this is not necessary as this is in fact a recreational league.  I tend to agree.

Let me know your thoughts, and I will pass them on to the league.
