Mark, per our conversations, please forward this to Kate Cole to show your approval.

Kate,

1.  Please create a new Entity Group in the Secretariat database called EWS - NETWORKS and update the database to reflect that the below-listed entities are in that group:

Clickpaper.com, L.L.C. *(TX)
CommodityLogic LLC
DealBench L.L.C. * (TX)
Enron Net Works Investments, L.L.C. *(TX)
Enron Net Works LLC *(TX)
EnronOnline, LLC
Acta Technology, Inc. (ECORP)
FinancialSettlementMatrix.com Inc. (Broadband)
ECOutlook.com, Inc. (EWS-ENA)
HoustonStreet Exchange, Inc. (EWS-ENA)

2.  Please make Tana Jones the Legal Asst on all of the entities listed above. 

3.  FYI - The bolded entites' LLC agreements are being amended (originals will be hand delivered on Monday) to allow for Mgrs (in order to be Manager managed as opposed to Member managed).  Embedded in these amended LLC agmts are the appointments of three Mgrs - Derrick, Haedicke and Whalley.

4.  FYI - Entities which have an asterik(*) are qualified in foreign jurisdictions and may, according to statute, need to file amended Certificates of Authority to reflect that they are now Manager managed.

5.  Also, to be delivered on Monday with the amended agreements is a consent of mgrs electing a standard slate to most of the entities listed above.

Thanks for your help in this regard.
