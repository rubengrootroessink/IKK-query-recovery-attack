David,

Thanks for your patience. We are working hard on getting Coral and BP
North America on board with the ring trades.

I have another counterparty that may want to ring out some ATM Chicago
basis. Let me know about that.

I have also enclosed the language that would tie all these trades
together.

Thanks,

Geof Storey
