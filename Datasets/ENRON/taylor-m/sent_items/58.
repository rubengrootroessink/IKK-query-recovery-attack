If you haven't heard back in an hour or so, you may have to print it out and go down and shove it under their noses.  Tana can show you where they sit if you don't already know.

I wanted to follow up with you regarding the draft statement I sent around
for comment last night.  I know you are very busy, but would greatly
appreciate it if you could send me any comments you have by noon New York
Time.  I re-attached it for your review.

Thank you in advance.

Kimberly Summe
