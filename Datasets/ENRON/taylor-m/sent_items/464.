We have a few items to add in the Services Agmt. as services to be provided:

Risk management services including, without limitation, position and limit reporting and price curve validation.

Transaction confirmation, settlement, scheduling, dispatch and volume management.

Human resources support including, without limitation, payroll, compensation and benefits.

Travel and aviation.


At the end of the current section 2.1(vi) please add "including, but not limited to, SAP."

Finally, we need to include Enron Corp. and Enron Net Works as parties providing services (e.g. Enron Corp. is where risk assessment is, Net Works has all of the IT).
