Sure - just send me the numbers -- or maybe a website or two.  We run the risk that when you show up it's a crappy boat but then we'll know better the next time.

Do you actually have to be in Woodstock to find a boat to charter for a sunset cruise?  Could I send you some phone numbers or something.  If you aren't going to arrive until Saturday, we could waste a lot of time driving around to boat yards on the Hudson.  I think we should have a sunset cruise for 6.

Had a great weekend and looking forward to next time.  Hope you made it
back to town ok.  I had no problems but I think you should just assume
that from the Newark airport it's at least 2.5 hours, probably a bit
more.  The Avis lady didn't bat an eye; of course I stood towards the
back of the car so she wasn't really looking at the front and there was
a big line forming behind me so she was in a hurry.  Did the kids get
away even close to on time?

Thanks again!
