I ma leaving for the evening but was hoping we might get together for a bit tomorrow some time to go over where things stand on Swapco and what needs to be done.  Can you leave a voice mail for me on 713-853-7459 letting me know what your schedule is like for tomorrow and when would work best for you?

Steve - in order to draft the contribution agreement for RMT to transfer
the ETP partnership interests to swapco, we will need to review the
partnership agreements (1) for required consents, etc. and (2) to schedule
the interests in the agreement.  Do you have copies of the appropriate
partnership agreements and, if not, do you know from whom we could get
them?  Thanks.
