I honestly have never heard of either of those companies so don't know how to get them signed.  I expect these are part of other efforts where I am not on the "need to know" list.  If you know another Enron lawyer involved in those efforts I suggest you try them.

Andy Stidd of Global Securitization Services is going to still serve as the
independent director of CGNN and as the independent manager of MCTJ LLC.  I
will have him prepare and execute a new Services and Indemnity Agreement.
Should I forward it to you for execution?
