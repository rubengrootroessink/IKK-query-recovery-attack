In case you need to tell people how to reach you on the boat:

The ship's phone number is 323-208-910 or 920.  The fax is 323-208-924 or 911.
These numbers must be preceded by the correct "Ocean Code."
From 9/4 to 9/6 the full number to dial is 011-874-323-208-910 (using the Atlantic West code).
From 9/7 to 9/9 it will be 011-871-323-208-910 (using the Atlantic East code).
I'm told that if you dial the wrong code you'll get a recording telling you which code to use.

It is also possible to call person-to-person by calling the local operator and asking for the INMARSAT operator.  You will need to give the INMARSAT operator the name of the ship, the guest's name and the closest land position.

Apparently it will also be possible to send and receive e-mails but the procedure remains unclear.
