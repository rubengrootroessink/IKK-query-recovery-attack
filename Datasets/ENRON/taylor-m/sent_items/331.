Hi Justin -- I'm afraid I don't really know what this is all about.  It sounds like it might be something the tax people should be doing.  Can you fill me in?

jason.  in response:

i believe the legal owner is Enron North America Corp. (see clause 3.1)
a separate agreement (signed by all parties including ENA) will need to be drafted to introduce a buy-in participant (by copy, Mark, has this been done before?...and if not, I wonder whether you would kindly ask someone in your group to prepare this given that this is a US document governed by Texas law...hope this is okay)

thanks

justin

Justin,

When we last met you were going to look at a couple of for things for me, these were:

1 - Who is the legally owner of all residual rights attaching to EOL intangible? and
2 - What documentation is need to introduce a buy in participant to the agreement and then draft such document.

Could you let me know the status of both these items.  FYI - the items are needed for the US tax return (which cannot be filed without them) which is being filed in the next week or so. Accordingly, we need to execute and send to US for inclusion before this deadline - ideally I would like to do early next week.

Thanks for your help on this one.
Regards
Jason
