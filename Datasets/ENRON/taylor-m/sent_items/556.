We are scheduled to play our last game tomorrow night.
The 1st vs 2nd, 3rd vs 4th, etc. teams play each other.
We are playing the 6th place team.
If we win, we could finish in 4th; if we lose, we would finish in 6th.

Let me know by this afternoon if you can play tomorrow.

Time: 8.45 pm
Place: Cullen Park, Field A
Opponent: Entrix (we beat them 2-0 during the regular season)

Please be at the field a little early so that we can organize.
Please bring your jerseys to the game.

Call 281 398 2229 tomorrow after 4.30 pm to make sure the game is still on (weather-related).
