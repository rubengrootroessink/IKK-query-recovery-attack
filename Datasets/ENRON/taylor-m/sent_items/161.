Hi George.  I'm sorry I didn't get back to you sooner.  I was just going through some old e-mails and found this one that had somehow slipped through without being read.

I'm living in Houston these days.  I was actually in London on 9/11.  My flight back (scheduled for Wednesday that week) was cancelled and I finally made it back on that Sunday.  I'm sure there were much worse places to be stranded but it wasn't a lot of fun being away from home then.  I was traveling with a couple of good friends from NYC and it was pretty tense trying to track down their friends in Manhattan.

Mark K. is in NYC.  I have heard from him and he and his family are fine.  I think his company is now called American Century and he is still managing international mutual funds.

I was in Monmouth last weekend for homecoming.  Dahlquist, McGehee, McCabe, Perschke, Vance and Ehrenhart were there.  Ehrenhart actually has a son who is a freshman at Monmouth and has joined ZBT.  

Hope you guys are doing well.

Mark

Hope you are not still in New York City?   Is Mark K. still working for
20th Century in New York?
