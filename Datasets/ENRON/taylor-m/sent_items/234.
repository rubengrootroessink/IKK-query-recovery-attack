I would very much like to get some time with each of these people while I'm there.  I have already arranged some time with Jonathan Marsh on Monday morning since he knows a lot about the ISDA meeting that afternoon.  I would prefer, if possible, to have some time with each of Paul Simons and Justin Boyd before the rest of the crew so that I can hear a bit about them before I actually sit down with them.  Don't worry if that's not possible.  I'd also like to get some time with each of Edmund Cooper, Mark Elliott, Mark Evans, Robert Quick and Marcus Von Bock.  Mark Evans would be best towards the end of the stay - maybe lunch on Wed.?

Holly

I have been advised by Paul Simons that Mark Taylor will be visiting London on Monday 25th June to attend an ISDA Energy and Developing Products Committee Meeting.  Paul has suggested that Mark may want to meet up with some of the new lawyers in the legal department namely Ian Brungs, Paul Johnson, Jonathan Marsh (Compliance Officer), Sophie Martin, Sarah Sinclair, Peter Traung and Janet Wood.  Please can you check with Mark whether this is the case and if so, please contact me and we can fix up some time in their diaries.

Many thanks for your help.

Kind regards.
