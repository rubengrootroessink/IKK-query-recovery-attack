Please provide by e-mail a reply to me by 2:00 p.m. Central Standard Time today with a list, to the best of your knowledge, of the following (if any), as it relates to the ENW group of companies:

"Each transaction or series of transactions from January 1, 1999 to the date hereof, and each currently proposed transaction, or series of transactions, that is of a value of $500,000 or more , to which Enron Corp. or any of its Subsidiaries (defined as being owned 50% or more, or controlled, directly or indirectly, by Enron Corp.) was or is a party, and in which an officer or officers of Enron or any of its Subsidiaries (officer being a VP or above) has a personal financial interest."

Sorry for the quick time fuse.

Regards, Alan
