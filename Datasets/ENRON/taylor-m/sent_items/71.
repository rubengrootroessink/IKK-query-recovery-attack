Amanda came back yesterday.  Bill didn't want to fly to Europe and Amanda was able to get on a flight back.  They are going to take a little vacation here in the U.S.

Skadden was amazingly lucky.  We have so many people it seems impossible that we didn't have anyone in the blast.  A messenger who works for a messenger service was delivering a package for us and he is unaccounted for.  And in the case of family members, so far only one associate has reported a missing brother.   It is so amazing how lucky we were.

I have a paralegal who lives in the blast area - Claudia Hong - but she came to work early that day.  She can't get in her apartment so I am looking for temporary housing for her.  She is on Oscar's couch ( you met Oscar at the party) right now.  But I have to find something better.  Let me know if you know anyone in Manhattan who has an empty apt for a week or two.

Keep in touch

Thanks for making my morning.  I'm still grinning at the image of your bags
going back and forth across the Atlantic.

I saw the emergency command center on TV the other night and it looked just
like that huge room where we stood in line and checked in for the ship.  I
think that's why they can't dock in ny.

Has Amanda made it back yet?
