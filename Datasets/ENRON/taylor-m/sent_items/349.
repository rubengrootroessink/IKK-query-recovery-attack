Sorry for any confusion. You can use either mark.taylor or mark.e.taylor@enron.com for my e-mails.  mtaylor@enron.com actually belongs to a colleague named Mitch Taylor so I don't know how it got to williard.com -- or where all those messages you've been sending ended up!  All very confusing.

Mark -

Did you receive this?  I sent this the other day to mtaylor@enron.com but it
was opened by an mtaylor@williard.com??  I called your office to confirm
your e-mail address and was given mark.e.taylor@enron.com.  Is
mtaylor@enron.com wrong?  That's the address I've been using for some time
now.
