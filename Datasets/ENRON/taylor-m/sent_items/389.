We have had discussions involving Tom Moran in credit, but I don't know if they have done a formal review. The initiative with AA came through Sarah-joy Hunter in the businesss development group, through soem cross corporate initiatives. AA would not allow us to bid on business because we are not an 'A' rated company, but given some of the other issues they felt they would allow us to come in. Tom said they are BBB-, so I know he has done some preliminary work. I'll bounce it off him and get you an answer asap.

Richard --  Has Credit done a review for AAA yet?  We will need their input before we can evaluate the form.

Rich,

Attached is the preliminary draft of the ISDA agreement.  Please look over it with your legal and send us your comments or proposed revisions.
