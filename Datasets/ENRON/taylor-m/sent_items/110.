Mark,

Further to my voicemail.  The Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) has asked to have the old lines from NatWest novated to RBS.  The 2 banks merged approx. 2 years ago.

RBS will send the originals to the appropriate person within Enron.

Would you please advise as to who, in your view, would be the appropriate person to handle this novation.

Many thanks in advance,
Suzanne Ferlic
011 44 207 783 4249

Line Limits are:
 
NW FX & DSL, US$13m, 2 yrs, no security
 
NW CRRM, US$97m, 15 yrs, has gtee from Enron Corp
 
Please let me know where and to whom we can send the original documents
to.
Thanks,
Jamie

Hi Suzanne,
 
Please find attached the Novation Request letter which outlines the actions
required to novate your trades from the NatWest name to the RBS.   The
documents which need to be executed are :-
 
1.  Novation Agreement

*	You will get this from Diane Jeannot from our Legal & Compliance in
NY soon
*	This is to authorise the novation of the trades from the NW books
into RBS books, and to be covered by your existing RBS Master ISDA
*	To sign both copies, but return only one (fax and mail)

2.  Credit Support Annex 

*	Please see attached CSA Authorisation, please sign at the bottom and
return via fax
*	As there is collateral tied to the NW Master ISDA, we will need to
novate the collateral as well.

3.  Letter from your Guarantor - Enron Corp

*	To novate the guarantee in favour of NW to RBS

4.  RBS Settlement Instructions Acknowledgement

*	See attached RBS Settlement Instructions and Acknowledgement letter.
*	This is to acknowledge that anything booked in the RBS names have to
be paid into RBS accounts provided, so these new instructions should be
distributed to your payments division.
*	Please sign and return by fax

Please let me know if you have any queries at all.  All documents can be
returned to me, my address is on the Novation Letter. 
 
One thing to note, the deadline is actually October 3rd for all documents to
be returned.  Unfortunately, we are a little late in sorting it out with
Adam and sending you the documents, but I will appreciate if you could
arrange for this to be done as soon as possible, and let me know a realistic
date for return.  Apologies for the rush.
 
 
Thanks and regards,
Jamie Wood
