Thanks for making my morning.  I'm still grinning at the image of your bags going back and forth across the Atlantic.

I saw the emergency command center on TV the other night and it looked just like that huge room where we stood in line and checked in for the ship.  I think that's why they can't dock in ny.

Has Amanda made it back yet?

Andrea found the bags. They are still on the QE2 going back and forth across the ocean.  The QE2 can't come to ny. It is going to dock in boston on sept 28. They are going to ups our two bags to us from boston.
