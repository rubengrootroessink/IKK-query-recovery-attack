A spoon is a good start.  I think it's good as a cake frosting, as a filling between a couple of cookies, maybe spread on toast or even dissolved in coffee?  In Buenos Aires I remember it coming in a tiny little jar at breakfast along with the marmalade and honey -- goodness knows what they put it on.

So tell me....Exactly how do I eat the dulce de lece?  With a spoon?  Do I put it on other things?  Mix it in anything?  I don't want to waste any of it experimenting............

Had a great weekend and looking forward to next time.  Hope you made it
back to town ok.  I had no problems but I think you should just assume
that from the Newark airport it's at least 2.5 hours, probably a bit
more.  The Avis lady didn't bat an eye; of course I stood towards the
back of the car so she wasn't really looking at the front and there was
a big line forming behind me so she was in a hurry.  Did the kids get
away even close to on time?

Thanks again!
