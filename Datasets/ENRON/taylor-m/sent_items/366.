GET RICH ON $6.00


We have all heard of the get rich quick, right? Well, I am taking a chance,
I do know one of the people and
they have received about $600 so far..  She also said that it is the
easiest money she has ever made. So, lets give it a try! You have lost
a lot more than this at the park..

PLEASE READ IN ITS ENTIRETY
$6.00 CAN GET YOU THOUSANDS IN JUST A FEW MONTHS!


This method works in a very short time. The cost is only $6.00!
This is the 16th day since I started receiving $ cash, and so
far I have received $5,845 (in $1 Bills)...so I guess this is really
working already! Give it a try! All I did was follow the
instructions in the letter that I received below, and sent out
some e-mail to people that responded to my ads.

Here is a testimony from one of the thousands that have
benefited from this get-rich-quick plan:


"I'm a retired attorney, and about a year ago a man came to me
with a letter. The letter he brought to me is the same letter before
you now. He asked me to verify that this letter was legal. I told
him that I would review it and get back to him. When I first read
the letter, I thought it was some off the wall idea to make money.
 A week later I met again with my client to discuss the issue. I told
him that the letter originally brought to me was not 100% legal.
I advised him to make a small change in the letter and it will
be all right. I was curious about the letter, so he told me how
it worked. I thought it was a long shot, so I decided against
participating.

Before my client left, I asked him to keep me updated as to his
results.

About two months later he called me to tell me that he had
received more than $800,000.00 in cash!! I didn't believe him so
he asked me to try the plan and see for myself."

"I thought about it for a few days and decided that there was
not much to lose. I followed the instructions exactly and mailed
out 200 letters. Sure enough the money started coming in! It
came slowly at first, but after three weeks I was getting more
than I could open in a day. After three months the money stopped
coming. I kept a precise record of my earnings and at the end it
totaled $868,439.00. I earn a good living as an attorney, but as
anyone in the legal profession will tell you, there is a lot of
stress that comes with the territory. I decided if things worked
out, I would retire from practice and play golf. This time I
sent out 500 letters. Well, three months later, I had totaled
$2,344,178.00."

"I met my old client for lunch to find out exactly how it works.
He told me that there were a few similar letters going around.
What made this one different is the fact that there were six
names on the letter, not three like most others. That fact alone
resulted in more returns. The other factor was the advice I gave
him in making sure the whole thing was perfectly legal, since no
one wants to risk doing anything illegal. I bet now you are
curious about what little changes I told him to make. Well if
you send a letter like this one out, to be legal, you must sell
something if you expect to receive a dollar. I told him that
anyone sending a dollar must receive something in RETURN. So
when you send a dollar to each of the six names on the list, you
must include a slip of paper saying, "Please add me to your
mailing list" and include your name, mailing address and e-mail
address.

This is the key to the program. The item you will receive for
your dollar sent, is THIS letter and the right to earn
thousands."


Follow the simple instructions EXACTLY, and in less than three
months you should receive MORE THAN $800,000.00 IN COLD HARD
CASH!


1) IMMEDIATELY send ONE DOLLAR [$1.00 US$] to each of the six
people listed below. THE SOONER YOU SEND THE "$1.00 LETTERS" THE
SOONER YOU CAN START GETTING A RETURN! Wrap the dollar (in order
to prevent thievery) in a note saying "PLEASE ADD ME TO YOUR
MAILING LIST". Include YOUR NAME, MAILING ADDRESS AND E-MAIL
ADDRESS.

**REMEMBER, if you don't ask for the service, USE OF THIS
LETTER WILL BE ILLEGAL FOR YOU.

*****PLEASE make sure you have used the correct postage and
include a return address! This is VERY IMPORTANT!


2) Send an e-mail to each of the names above with "$1 SENT" in
the subject line. Write your name and mailing address. This is
important as it would inform them as to how many people had
joined the program under them.
Likewise, it will give them the estimate of how many one-dollar
bills they should receive.


3) REMOVE the NAME and ADDRESS NEXT to #1 at the TOP of the list
and move the rest of the names UP one position. Then place YOUR
name in the #6 spot.

This is best done by saving this to a file, then enter in your
information on line #6. Be careful when you type the addresses.
Don't forget to PROOFREAD them. Make SURE that the names and
addresses are correct. Also include your e-mail address.


4) When you have COMPLETED the above instructions, you have
several options on how you market the letter - through the
Postal Service, through E-mail to at least 200 people, IF YOU HAVE AN
FFA PAGE THAT WILL BE EASY, or through posting in "FREE CLASSIFIED
ADS" and "NEWSGROUPS" ON THE INTERNET, or through whatever
 way you deem is legal.

This letter has been proven perfectly legal for all of the above
as long as you follow the instructions, because you are
purchasing membership in our exclusive mailing list.
You can also use a Mass e-mail Network to mail it out in large
volumes for you. We highly recommend this one. They always e-
mail more than the amount you purchase, and their addresses are
always fresh. Posting Free Classified Ads on the Internet can
achieve good results. Simply go to a search engine, Yahoo, Hot
Bot, Lycos or any other, and type in Free Classified Ads. You
will get a list of over 190,000 sites for you to start post ads.
Use a catchy title such as FREE MONEY, and post your e-mail
address. When people inquire, simply send them a copy of this
letter by e-mail. The more you send out, the more YOU will make.
We strongly encourage you to mail this letter to family,
friends, and relatives as well.

THIS IS A SERVICE AND IS 100% LEGAL. (Refer to title 18, section
1302 & 1341 of the US Postal and Lottery Laws), or check it out
with the US Post Office @1-800-725-2161.


**Assume for example you get a 8% return rate.

1) When you mail out 200 letters, ONLY 16 people send you $1.00

2) Those 16 people mail out 200 letters, (3200 letters) and ONLY
256 people send you $1.00

3) Those 256 people mail out 200 letters, (51,200 letters) and
ONLY 4,096 people send you $1.00.

4) Those 4,096 people mail out 200 letters (819,200 letter) and
ONLY 65,536 people send you $1.00.

5) Those 69,536 people mail out 200 letters (13,107,200 letters)
and ONLY 1,048,576 people send you $1.00.

At the Next level your name-drops off the list.

Think about it. Look what you WILL have BEFORE your name-drops
off the list!

I know this looks and sounds unbelievable. Just try it, and you will be
happy that you did because you will receive proof when THOUSANDS of
ONE-DOLLAR BILLS start to pile up!

*** MAKE SURE you send **One US dollar** to each of the six names on
 the list (This is VERY IMPORTANT), with a note saying
"PLEASE ADD ME TO YOUR MAILING LIST".


P.S. You've read this far, so let me ask you one simple question,

WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO LOSE?..... $6.00 !!!

Even with a 1% return you will still get $100,000.00 in 90 DAYS!
What you can gain is an income, like the example in this letter.
You will have a very small expense, but you will reap HUGE
potential returns! What do you have to lose? I invite you to
JOIN our mailing list RIGHT NOW!


Thank you for your time. GOOD LUCK & BEST WISHES TO YOU!!!
