Martin's note below addresses our efforts to put ISDAs in place for Nordic 
trading. It looks like we're making some progress, particularly with Morgan 
Stanley.

FYI, Wednesday morning this week I met with two in-house attorneys at Eastern 
Electricity in Ipswich and, in the afternoon, with about half a dozen people 
at Morgan Stanley in the company's offices in Canary Wharf.  The principal 
purpose of these meetings were  to discuss the Nordic documentation project 
and related issues.  Both companies appear to be very supportive of the 
initiative taken.  On the point of ISDA, I didn't spot any overwhelming 
enthusiasm from the Eastern attorneys to trade Nordic power with us on the 
back of the ISDA Master (although they didn't reject to the idea), but MS is 
very keen on doing this why that  company should be the next in line 
following Vattenfall.

It's been a bit tight around here today why we should rather have the 
conversation a mentioned yesterday sometime next week.

Martin
