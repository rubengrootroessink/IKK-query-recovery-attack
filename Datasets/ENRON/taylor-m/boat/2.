The attached file is a copy of your migrated calendar information. If you imported your calendar automatically when you first logged on, you do not need to continue. Verify that your calendar information was imported correctly, and then delete this message.

If you migrated calendar information to a personal folder file (.pst) or were not prompted to import your calendar information automatically, you can import it now by performing the following steps depending on your client platform.


Microsoft Outlook for Windows 95, 98, NT, and Windows 2000

1.	In Microsoft Outlook, from the File menu, choose 'Save Attachments'.

2.	Type the location and file name for the attached file, and then choose 'Save'.

3.	From the File menu, choose 'Import and Export'.

4.	Choose 'Import from another program or file', and then choose 'Next'.

5.	If the file attachment is a .cal file, choose 'Schedule+ 1.0'. If the file attachment is an .scd file, choose 'Schedule+ 7.0'. If the file attachment is an .sc2 file, choose 'Schedule Plus Interchange'.

6.	Type the path and file name of the file you want to import. Under Options, select 'Do not import duplicate items' to ensure that any previously imported items will not be duplicated.

Microsoft Outlook Calendar for Windows for Workgroups Version 3.11 and Windows Version 3.1

If you migrated calendar information to the Microsoft Exchange Server information store, your calendar is automatically migrated and you do not need to continue. Verify that your calendar information was imported correctly, and then delete this message.

If you migrated calendar information to a personal folder file (.pst) or your calendar information was not imported correctly, you can import it now by performing the following steps depending on your client platform.

1.	On the calendar message, from the File menu, choose 'Save As'.

2.	Choose 'Attachments', type the location and file name, and then choose OK.

3.	If the file you need to import is already a Schedule Plus Interchange .sc2 file, go to step 9.  If the file you need to import is a Schedule+ 1.0 .cal file, or a Schedule+ 7.0 .scd file, start Microsoft Outlook Calendar by selecting the 'Show Calendar' toolbar button in Microsoft Outlook, or running Microsoft Outlook Calendar from the group where it is installed.

4.	From the main Microsoft Outlook Calendar menu, choose 'File', and then choose 'Open'. Then choose 'Archive or Project Schedule'.

5.	Select the file to be opened by typing the path and file name that you specified in step 2, and then choose OK.

6.	In this new Microsoft Outlook Calendar window, select 'File', and then choose 'Export'. Then choose 'Outlook Calendar Interchange'.

7.	Select a location and file name for the export file (.sc2), and then choose OK.

8.	Close the Outlook Calendar window.

9.	From the main Microsoft Outlook Calendar menu, select 'File' and 'Import'. Then choose 'Outlook Calendar Interchange'.

10.	Select the file to be imported by typing the path to the .sc2 file, and then choose OK. The calendar data from the .sc2 file will be imported to your Microsoft Outlook Calendar.
