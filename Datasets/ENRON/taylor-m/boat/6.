Well JJ it looks like you are up to your arm pits in mechanics.
The three guys I recommend without reserve are not heavy duty mechanics;
First is the upholstry, bimini,dodger, guy Jack Wier 281..538.2145
Live aboard and floating shop at Maria del mud
Second is Jim Tisdale Carpenter and electrical pager281.321..7827
I dream of having Jim build me a house. First rate guy.
Third Domenick Santoro cell281.513..3086
All around mechanic ex yard mgr.@Seabrook shipyard

All three of these guys have done extensive work on Spirit Horse and
will do the next boat too.
