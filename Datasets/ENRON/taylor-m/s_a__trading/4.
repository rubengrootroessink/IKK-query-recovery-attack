I think that Mr. Tawil=01,s report caught the substance of the meeting at t=
he=20
embassy so I will not be adding much more detail.  I will echo that everyon=
e=20
attending the meeting seemed very interested in learning more about the sta=
mp=20
tax issue, how the provinces are pursuing the issue, what the government is=
=20
saying as well as what it is actually doing to solve the issue.   In fact=
=20
they are interested in having everyone at the embassy get up to speed on th=
is=20
issue so that each of them can raise the issue with their counterpart in th=
e=20
Argentine government.  As mentioned in Mr. Tawil's report they will review=
=20
the information that was delivered to them and will likely request addition=
al=20
information from Enron regarding this issue.  At one point during the meeti=
ng=20
Mr. Thompson asked and left open the question of what else can the Embassy =
do=20
to help on this issue.  They are already trying to raise the general issue =
of=20
stamp taxes at each level of the government they get the chance to meet=20
with.  I would suggest that if we do not hear from either Mr. Thompson or M=
r.=20
Climan in the next little while that Enron should request a follow up meeti=
ng=20
to discuss the tax issue in more detail.

With respect to the visit of Secretary Daly, they were not sure if the stam=
p=20
tax issue will be one of the issues the Secretary will have on his agenda b=
ut=20
they indicated that it will likely be a topic in other contemporaneous=20
meetings.  There will likely be between 15 and 20 companies in the delegati=
on=20
coming with the Secretary.  One third will be energy companies, one third=
=20
will be telecom companies and the other third will be a mix representing=20
other industries.

Mr. Thompson expressed some concern that Enron did not previously notify th=
e=20
Embassy that we had given notice to the Argentine government that we were=
=20
initiating the 6-month negotiation period under the BIT.  They thought that=
=20
they are most effective in providing help in these types of situations when=
=20
they are notified at the inception of the dispute while there is time to ma=
ke=20
a difference.  It seems to me that it would still benefit us to establish a=
nd=20
maintain contact with the embassy on this issue to keep them informed of th=
e=20
status of the negotiations with the government and, if and when applicable,=
=20
inform them as to whether we are intending to pursue arbitration.   =20

My impression from the meeting is that they would be very receptive to more=
=20
frequent contact regarding not only tax issues but any other issue we may=
=20
have.   It is my understanding from speaking with Jeff Kabel that Mr. Clima=
n=20
has previously expressed a desire to learn more about the energy sector in=
=20
Argentina and how it works.  This may provide us with the opportunity to=20
create a closer relationship with the key personnel at the embassy.=20

Please feel free to distribute my comments to whoever else you feel should=
=20
see them.

Regards,
Brent
