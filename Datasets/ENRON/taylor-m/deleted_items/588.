>****************************************************************
>
>INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY
>
>When you talk about real estate, you talk about LOCATION, LOCATION. When
>you talk about Commercial Hotel real estate, you talk about LOCATION,
>LOCATION and MANAGEMENT. VHLD appears to be on to something, VHLD's
>present strategy to maximize shareholder value is to acquire "boutique"
>hotels located in South Beach, Florida.
>
>For those Wizard subscribers who are not familiar with South Beach,
>Florida market, let The Wizard try to describe. First, this area is home
>to nearly 800 Art Deco buildings which were primarily constructed during
>the 1920s, 30s and 40s. The South Beach area is comprised of small
>"boutique" hotels, nightclubs, restaurants and lots of chic shopping
>stores. South Beach is a unique area to Miami Beach, from 1st street to
>12th street, including Ocean Drive, Collins Avenue, and Washington Avenue.
>Miami Dade's hotel occupancy rates have lead the nation for the first five
>months of 2001. South Beach is strategically located near Miami's
>financial district and a very attractive destination to tourists from all
>over the world..
>
>VHLD's plan is to acquire existing "boutique" hotels in South Beach, FL.,
>that are currently operating and profitable. VHLD is simply taking
>existing hotels and attempting to make them better, by partnering with an
>experienced hotel management company that has a proven track record of
>doing exactly what VHLD is looking to accomplish.
>
>To this extent, VHLD has retained Hospitality Advisory Group, Inc. (HAG),
>which is led by Mr. Richard Wilhelm. Richard Wilhelm is a hotel management
>professional, with over thirty years of experience in management of a
>number of premier hotel and resort properties in the United States. These
>properties include such landmark hotels as the Plaza Hotel, the St. Regis
>and the Waldorf-Astoria in New York City; Trump Castle in Atlantic City;
>and recently, the Island Outpost group of hotels in Miami Beach's popular
>South Beach area.
>
>The core business of HAG is that of providing comprehensive hotel
>management services to their clients, which is VHLD. Services typically
>provided include the full spectrum of operational, financial, and
>marketing management of hotel properties. HAG works in every appropriate
>way to drive revenues. A key element in HAG?s management program is the
>focus on a comprehensive, targeted sales and marketing effort to "put
>heads in the bed.
>**************************************************************
>
>VALUATION
>
>Some of the greatest corporations in America were created with a simple
>concept. VHLD is currently under contract to acquire prime South Florida
>hotel properties that on average are 70% occupied year round. By
>partnering with a top-notch hotel management company, leveraging off their
>expertise, hope to increase the annual occupancy rate to over 80% within 2
>years
>
>For example, HAG became the management company for the Tides Hotel in
>South Beach, Fl. when it reopened after a major renovation. By the end of
>the 1st year the Tides had an 88% occupancy rate.
>
>VHLD intends to acquire 9 hotels by the end of calendar year 2002 that
>will be running at an annualized revenue rate in excess of $100 MILLION
>DOLLARS. These 9 hotels assets will be in excess of $200 MILLION DOLLARS.
>VHLD intends to close on 3 of the nine hotels by the end of this calendar
>year (2001). These three hotels are estimated to generate $12.8 Million
>Dollars in revenue's and Net Operating Income (NOI) of $2.5 Million
>Dollars on assets of $28 Million Dollars in 2002.
>
>VHLD intends to close on their 1st hotel within 30 days. When achieved
>this should become a significant milestone for VHLD as well as the stock.
>The first hotel is called The Astor VHLD currently manages The Astor. The
>Astor was originally built in 1936 and remodeled in 1995. VHLD is Buying
>The Astor for $16 Million Dollars in a combination of cash and debt
>(mortgage).
>
>In year 2000 The Astor generated about $5.5 Million in revenues and had
>approx. $1 Million NOI.
>
>According to HAG, based upon their projections using their management
>techniques, HAG projects The Astor?s revenues to rise to $7.2 Million and
>NOI to $1.5 Million in 2002.
>
>In addition, HAG projects that in all hotel acquisitions by VHLD, a
>portion of the profits in the 1st year under their management will be
>reinvested back into the hotels for improvements. Thereafter HAG projects
>NOI to approximate 25% of revenues. REMEMBER, VHLD is currently acquiring
>only profitable hotels, and looking to make them more profitable.
>
>VHLD is currently trading near a 52 week low. VHLD has been working
>quietly on achieving its goal of increasing shareholder value. There is
>hardly any news on VHLD, and virtually no chat over on the Internet. The
>Wizard believes this too might change shortly. The Wizard believes that
>once VHLD closes on the Astor Hotel the story becomes a little bit more
>believable. BUY ON THE RUMOR.
>*****************************************************************
>
>CONCLUSION
>
>One way to value a company is to look at its peers in the industry. Within
>this group companies currently trade at about a 50% discount to the S&P
>500 index, which equates to about 14x earnings. Based on VHLD closing 3
>hotels by year-end, and using HAG's forecast for profits of $2.5 Million
>or $0.26 cents per share. If VHLD were to trade in the market at 14x
>earnings, then this would equate to a stock price of $3.64 per share.
