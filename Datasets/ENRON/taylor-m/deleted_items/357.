Joanne -

I believe Pat was inquiring as to TradeSpark.  We have agreements with ENA and EPMI that were signed earlier this year.  I believe we also have one with EES, but this was negotiated by Will F.  We would have to check with him about the status.

Let me know what needs to be done on this matter.

Mark

Pat Kokes, a Contract Administrator with Dynegy at (713) 507-3726, called this morning, requesting info on Electronic Trading Agreements with Tradesbark for Enron Capital, Enron Energy Services, Enron Global Mktg & Enron Power Mktg.  Jeff Hodge said you would probably be the one to refer this to.  If possible, please give Mr. Kokes a call back today.
