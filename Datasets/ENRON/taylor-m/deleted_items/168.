djust your settings.  Also this month, we introduce a rotating Top 5 list, =
which in the months to come will visit the many industry and functional cat=
egories that make up our site. October's list focuses on the corporate-fina=
nce  function. Among other things, McKinsey authors present a postmortem on=
 the Nasdaq crash, explain how companies can avoid vendor-financing disaste=
rs, and debunk the illusion that costs deserve more attention than revenues=
 after a merger.  See you at the site!  Lang Davison Editor, mckinseyquarte=

uncertainty   Is your company a shaper or an adapter? Shapers get most of t=
he glory in the press, but adapting can be just as lucrative. The secret of=
 this essential strategic choice is that the more uncertain your markets ar=
e, the better your chance to shape them in a direction of your own choosing=
.  Managing the asset manager   Since asset-management companies rely so mu=
ch on talent, they must be top-notch at recruiting, developing, rewarding, =
and retaining it-right? Actually, our survey shows that only some of them m=
anage their talent well. Surprise, surprise-these are the firms that delive=
r the best returns to shareholders.  What do broadband consumers want?   Th=
e US broadband population has moved beyond predominantly young and male ear=
ly adopters to comprise both sexes and a wide cross-section of age, family =
composition, and income. This article segments these new users into helpful=
 categories and behavioral patterns that companies can employ for savvy dec=

 adviser Reed Hundt, a recent chairman of the FCC, explains why the future =
still looks good for this beleaguered industry.  Has outsourcing gone too f=
