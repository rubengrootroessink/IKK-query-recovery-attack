Cheryl - This is just a quick note to confirm that in our meeting this morning we agreed that: (a) the comparison of the drafts of the Schedule and Paragraph 13  prepared by Southern California Gas Company and our usual language for the same documents will be completed for review by the end of business on Wednesday, October 24 (the cover letter to the comparison should contain clear descriptions of why we prefer our language); (b) your reading of Johnson, "Over-the-Counter Derivatives Documentation" shall be completed by Monday, October 22 so that we can discuss it (please have Keegan Farrell coordinate a time on Monday when we can meet); and (c) you would provide me with a copy of the draft ISDA for Welch's so that I can review the comments of McDermott, Will & Emery.  Many thanks.  Frank
