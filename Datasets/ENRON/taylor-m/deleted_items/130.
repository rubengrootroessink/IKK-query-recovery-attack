I am in Houston office Thursday 13 and the morning of Friday 14 Sept if it would help to meet up and discuss further.

Diagram follows. Prior to (I think)  August 20 ECTRIC was the principal to the European trades not effected by Oslo (transactions all arranged by EEFT for regulatory purposes), and post August 20 the principal to the European trades effected out of London is EFET LLC (again arranged by EEFT for regulatory purposes). Just by way of background EFET LLC will be the principal for all financial trades done out of London (i.e will contract coal, power, gas financials and not just weather, so there should be some reduction in the number of ISDAs to be put in place).
