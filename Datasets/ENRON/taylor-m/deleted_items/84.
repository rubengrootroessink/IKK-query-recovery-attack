Mark,

I think we should plan on something more casual for Friday evening.  Since
you are the foodie, please let me know which restaurant you would like to
have dinner at on Saturday evening and I'll make reservations today.  Also,
please let me know if there is another restaurant you would like to have
lunch at and I can make that reservation as well.

looking forward to seeing you!
Ted

My flight doesn't get in until 10:30 or so on Friday night.  Not sure
what we can still do for food at that hour.  Do people eat late in Ft.
Lauderdale?  In case you're still looking for food ideas, I found these
that looked interesting:


Bistro Mezzaluna
Armadillo Cafe (Davie)
Left Bank
Hobo's Fish Joint (Coral Springs)
Darrel & Olivers Cafe Maxx (Pompano Beach)

Not sure but I think the first two may be reasonably close to the
airport, the next one in Fort Lauderdale but have no idea where the last
two are.  All get good marks in Zagats.  Look them up at zagats.com and
see what you think.
