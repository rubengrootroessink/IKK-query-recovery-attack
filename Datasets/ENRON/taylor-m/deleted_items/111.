I have reviewed the language your counsel sent and have discussed it with o=
ur General Counsel.  We can agree to remove the loss of bargain concept but=
 not the other two damage concepts.  We do not agree to the removal of "cos=
t of funding" since this can be a very real issue when a replacement transa=
ction requires a premium to be paid because of the off-market position.  Pr=
emiums for such positions will have a cost of funding component.  The remov=
al of the concept of "loss or cost incurred as a result of terminating, liq=
uidating, or obtaining or reestablishing a hedge or trading position" is al=
so a very real factor in calculating damages.  It may very well be that the=
 termination of a hedge is the more cost effective alternative to replacing=
 the transaction.  Furthermore, the you can obtain the same effect of termi=
nating a hedge by entering into an offsetting transaction (the equivalent o=
f a replacement transaction) rather than an outright termination with the h=
edge counterparty. Because the termination of a hedge is the other side of =
the coin, so to speak, it makes sense to leave it in the definition of Loss=
.  We can clarify that such losses and costs are without duplication, which=
 I think was one of your outside counsels concerns.  The definition of Loss=
 as was written is designed so that the Non-defaulting party can recover th=
e actual damages occasioned by the Defaulting Party's failure to perform.  =
If the Defaulting Party objects to the Non-defaulting Party's calculation t=
hen such calculation would be subject to negotiation or litigation and fina=
l determination by a New York court. =20

We would propose modifying your changes to read as follows:=20

Insert the following into Part 1(e), after the period at the end thereof. =
=20

"The definition of Loss shall be amended and restated in its entirety as fo=
llows:=20

"Loss" means, with respect to this Agreement or one or more Terminated Tran=
sactions, as the case may be, and a party, the Termination Currency Equival=
ent of an amount that party reasonably determines in good faith and in a co=
mmercially reasonable manner its total losses and costs (or gain, in which =
case expressed as a negative number), without duplication, in connection wi=
th this Agreement or that Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Tra=
nsactions, as the case may be, including any cost of funding or, at the ele=
ction of such party but without duplication, loss or cost incurred as a res=
ult of its terminating, liquidating, obtaining or reestablishing any hedge =
or related trading position (or any gain resulting from any of them).   to =
be equal to the actual replacement cost to that party in entering into a re=
placement transaction.  Loss does not include any loss of bargain, cost of =
funding or, loss or cost incurred as a result of its terminating, liquidati=
ng, obtaining or reestablishing any hedge or related trading positions.  Fu=
rthermore, Loss does not include loss of bargain, or  a party's legal fees =
and out-of-pocket expenses referred to under Section 11.  A party will dete=
rmine its Loss as of the relevant Early Termination Date, or, if that is no=
t reasonably practicable, as of the earliest date thereafter as is reasonab=
ly practicable.  A party may (but need not) determine its Loss by reference=
 to quotations of relevant rates or prices from one or more leading dealers=
 in the relevant market."


 If the concept of a Replacement Value is preferable to you we are also wil=
ling to use the following definition, which was originally drafted by Goldm=
an Sachs, in lieu of the Loss definition.
 =20
"Replacement Value" , means, with respect to each Terminated Transaction or=
 group of Terminated Transactions, as the case may be, and a party, an amou=
nt that the party (the "Determining Party") or its agent determines in good=
 faith and in a commercially reasonable manner to be its total losses and c=
osts (or gains, in which case expressed as a negative number) in connection=
 with that Terminated Transaction or group of terminated Transactions.  A D=
etermining Party (or its agent) may determine Replacement Values for all Te=
rminated Transactions, any group of Terminated Transactions or individual T=
erminated Transactions, and may apply different valuation methods to differ=
ent Transactions or groups of Transactions.   A Determining Party (or its a=
gent) will determine Replacement Values for all Terminated Transactions as =
of the Early Termination Date, or, if that would not be commercially reason=
able, as of the latest date or dates before or the earliest date or dates a=
fter the Early Termination Date as would be commercially reasonable under t=
hen prevailing circumstances.

The definition of Loss would be replaced throughout the ISDA by the definit=
ion of Replacement Value. =20

We hope that one of these definitions will work for you.  Please call if yo=
u have any questions or comments on the definitions.

Brent
