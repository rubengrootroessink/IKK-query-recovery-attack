Mark,

SEC has asked for information in regards with Faslow's partnership.  This is not good news overall.  The potential risk is high.  However, it is being discounted in the stock already.  We will see what occurs from this.  The stock is very oversold.  However, the timetable of a bounce is questionable.

Take Care

Rob Nichols
