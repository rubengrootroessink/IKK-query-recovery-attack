Tony -

In following up on our conversation regarding modifications to the Agreement for Project Services, I have attached a redlined version of the original agreement we forwarded.  I have incorporated all of your comments with the exception of deleting Paragraph 5.2 and adding in a "bragging rights" clause.

Please forward the attached to your counsel for review and comment.



Mark
