Audrea,

I have checked with our legal and credit departments. Enron hereby grants PCS Nitrogen permission to discuss the swap positions between Enron and PCS with Bank of America.   These discussions are for the purpose of working towards a transaction whereby B of A would step in between Enron and PCS in regards to any natural gas swaps and options positions that you currently have in place with Enron. 

If I can be of further assistance, please do not hesitate to call.

Regards,

Craig Breslau
