 [IMAGE]    Dear MARK,   As the outdoor growing season winds down, many gar=
deners crave the sight and touch of live plants indoors. After years of tri=
als, we can recommend some highly reliable ways to keep winter at bay. Whet=
her for your own home or for a gift, our flowering plants are a handsome so=
urce of color.    White Flower Farm customers have come to love the intoxic=
ating mid-winter perfume of Jasmine . This subtropical vine produces cascad=
es of delicate white flowers that exhale a rich sweet fragrance. We'll begi=
n shipping plants as soon as they set buds, the week of Nov. 5.  [IMAGE]  H=
anging Jasmine  (#32581)  will perfume your home.   [IMAGE] Garden Pinks   =
(set of 3)  We look forward every spring to the spicy clove scent of common=
 Garden Pinks, and were delighted to discover that these hardy perennials c=
an be made to bloom indoors in fall or winter. Our crop of the variety 'Lit=
tle Pink'   has already begun to set buds and will brighten any windowsill =
space you can offer.   [IMAGE] Flowering Maple  (Abutilon pictum  'Thompson=
ii')  Our Victorian forebears discovered Flowering Maples, which remain per=
haps the most prolific of flowering houseplants. Given sun and plenty of mo=
isture, these sturdy plants will produce flowers 12 months a year. 'Thompso=
nii ' has the added attraction of gold-speckled foliage that contrasts with=
 the salmon blooms.    [IMAGE] Rosemary Standard -  single  plant or a  pai=
