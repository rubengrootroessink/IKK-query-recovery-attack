A Brave New Idea
If you have college tuitions to pay, retirements to fund, or
families to protect, then you have a lot of company.  How do you
invest in a market that has become so unpredictable?  These are
turbulent times. Turbulent in a different way than in economic
cycles of the past - there's more to it this time around.  What's
worked in the past won't necessarily work going forward.  And
since history tells us that the best time to invest is while market
sentiment is still down, it is crucial now more than ever to have
the right investment guide. So when the market moves, you won't get
left behind.

The Marketocracy Dream Team.
What if you could tell what the world's best investors were doing
every day?  The ability to buy what the best investors are buying,
and sell what they are selling, would be a dream come true. For
over a year, Marketocracy has been operating a web site - the
forum for an incredibly effective and proven trading and performance
tracking tool - designed to accurately measure the investment
ability of thousands of people, in order to identify the world's
most successful investors.  Currently, we follow and maintain
over 50,000 track records - more than 10 times the number of equity
funds tracked by Morningstar.  Never before has the investment
performance of so many been so accurately measured.

Tired of Advice from People that are Losing Money?
Marketocracy is based on the idea that the investors with the
greatest skills will achieve the greatest successes. The idea
that the only credential that really matters is track record.
Our m100 Index taps into the knowledge and investing strategies
of some of the best investors in the world.  Why choose a
single stock-picker to make guiding investment decisions that
must endure and remain strong over the long haul?  The m100 acts
more like a relay team, with stock-pickers passing the baton if
their performance falters, ensuring we always rely on the "fastest
and strongest runners" for performance. With 50,000 virtual funds,
we have access to a deep reservoir of proven investment talent
from which to choose the best performers at any given time.

Invest with Real Intelligence - Stock Selection at Peak Performance
How would you like to have 100 people as diligent as you are
covering all the areas of the market that you're not familiar with?
Marketocracy does what individual investors try to do for themselves
- continuously seeks the strategic advice of the right people at
the right time. Want to benefit from their stock picking abilities?

See For Yourself - m100 Journal Free Trial
We want to give you access to the ultimate investment tool: our
m100 Journal. The m100 Journal provides timely knowledge every
week of what many of the world's best investors are doing right
now - not last quarter, or 6 months ago - including the top buys,
sells, holdings, tips, and commentary of the m100 Index.  If you
want to look over the shoulders and benefit from some of the best,
simply hit "reply" to this email, and we will send you 4 free
issues of the m100 Journal, delivered to you weekly via an emailed
PDF attachment.
