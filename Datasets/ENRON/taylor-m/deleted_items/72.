Please let me know as and when your paralegal leaves.  Within the framework of a 5 to 10 hour/week need, we should be able to make this work.  Please ask whoever is going to coordinate with us regarding concrete needs to call me.  I would like the various requests to come through me so I can allocate to the paralegals on the basis of their workloads at the time.  

Thanks.

Cordially,
