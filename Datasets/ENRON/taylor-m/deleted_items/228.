Good Morning Mark!

I just spoke with Barbara and she has instructed me to inform you that she will only be out of the office today, Friday 10/26. Her return flight is on Sunday  and she will be at work on Monday, 10/29.  If you should need immediate assistance, please feel free to contact me at x5-3317.  Thank you,
