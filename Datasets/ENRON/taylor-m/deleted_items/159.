Dear Mark 
We are sending you this email as we feel this announcement, from a sister company with Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC, will be of interest to you.
From Institutional Investor Inc: 
Institutional Investor has announced the complete results of its annual All-America Research Team, the most prestigious and highly anticipated ranking of sell-side analysts in the United States profiling the top equity analysts in 79 industry sectors and investment categories.
To view which firms ranked highest in this year's survey, go to http://www.institutionalinvestoronline.com/em/  and browse the 2001 Leaders' Table:  
Salomon Smith Barney jumped from third place last year to unseat six-time winner Merrill Lynch and claimed top honors in Institutional Investor magazine's 30th anniversary All-America Research Team survey.
Salomon registered 55 total team positions to surpass second-place Credit Suisse First Boston, which had 52. Merrill Lynch recorded 51 positions. In all, analysts were rated in 79 industry sectors and investment specialties.
Members of the All-America Research Team were selected by surveying the directors of research and chief investment officers of major money management institutions, as well as other key U.S., European and Asian investors. In total, the opinions of more than 3,200 individuals were tapped.
This feature was compiled by Institutional Investor staff under the direction of Senior Editors Carolyn Sargent and Jane B. Kenney with Associate Editor Sivert Hagen and Assistant Editor Erika Ihara.
Institutional Investor, the premier financial monthly, has won 72 awards for editorial excellence in 35 years of publication.
The complete results of the All-America Research Team and the entire October editions of Institutional Investor magazine are available at IIPlatinum - http://www.iiplatinum.com/em/  - the premium web service for Institutional Investor magazine subscribers.
