Hi Mark,

I don't think we have ever met but I have taken over Dave Forsters responsibilities at EnronOnline. We just learnt from Leslie Hansen ( who heard from Reliant) that we have sent out letters and contracts to our top  customers about not sending written confirms for deals done on EnronOnline. While I was aware that we were working on trying to eliminate written confirmations this is the first I am hearing about letters sent to our customers. I would appreciate being kept in the loop on these matters so we are ready to respond in case of customer calls.
