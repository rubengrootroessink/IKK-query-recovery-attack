I have just finished the draft for our internal legal review and sent it around.  There are still a lot of work to be done but I do not know when everyone will have time to look at this considering how much other work there is.  How should we respond considering she has copied Tom Gros?

Leslie Sara, and Brent:

Could I get an update on were we are with the top 20 customer amendments.  Last week we got 5 amendments for power physical but we still haven't received any amendments for financial.  Entergy-Koch is very interested in ConfirmLogic and have asked for the amendments.  When can we get the amendments for Entergy-Koch completed?

Thanks,
KC
