4. Our Favorite Yacht Cruises

Most yachts offer the flexibility that bigger cruise ships can't: an almost
limitless number of places to dock, an itinerary that can change with the
weather and the whim of the passengers, and all sorts of amenities - from
e-mail access to on-board spas - that mimic the luxuries of a five-star
resort. For information on a few of our favorite yacht cruises - from the
Greek Islands to the Alaskan coast to the British Virgin Islands, visit the
TRIP.com NewsStand at:
http://www.trip.com/trs/trip/content/newsstand/newsstand_article.xsl?newsstand-category-id=9&newsstand-category-nm=on%20your%20side&newsstand-article-id=5302


5. Cruise Lines Implement Heightened Security Measures

In response to the tragedies of September 11 - and in an effort to ensure the
security and safety of passengers - the International Council of Cruise Lines
(ICCL) has issued a series of guidelines, which recommend that cruise lines
tighten existing security measures and implement new ones.

These guidelines, adopted by all the major cruise lines, include
identification requirements (passengers must show photo ID before boarding),
more thorough baggage inspection at all ports of call, and visitor
restrictions (bridge visits have been eliminated). In addition, uniformed and
plain-clothes security personnel have been placed aboard many ships, and
crews are undergoing stricter security screenings and background checks.

Most cruise itineraries are operating as scheduled, though it's important to
confirm both cruise and flight schedules before departure. If your flight is
cancelled, call TRIP.com at 1-888-484-3874 (1-888-4-THE-TRIP) and a customer
service representative can help you make alternative flights plans.
