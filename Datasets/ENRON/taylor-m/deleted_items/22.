MOST POWERFUL WOMEN IN BUSINESS
Patient but Not Passive
A new kind of leader emerged in our annual ranking of powerful businesswome=
n. She is strong and resolute, but not in a hurry.=20

For some 30 years--ever since women started jockeying for power in the  wor=
kplace--patience has gotten a bad rap. After all, the virtue fairly  reeks =
of a Victorian mission to corset women into the role of submissive  wife an=
d mother. So women have shunned it. Instead they have felt the  need to mak=
e bold pronouncements and rush to action. That was never  truer than during=
 the season of dot-com mania, when every CEO professed  to be leading a rev=
olution. And any leader who failed to act quickly was  supposed to get tram=
pled by the capitalist vanguard. =20
Now, in these new, more tempered times, patience may be about to reap  its =
reward. In FORTUNE's annual survey of the 50 Most Powerful Women in  Busine=
ss, we see the emergence of women who came to power slowly. We're  not talk=
ing about women who had the patience to suffer indignities or  who sat pass=
ively in an out-of-the-way corner. Rather, they stayed with  a company, ste=
adily building influence there, and rose to power through  determination an=
d insider knowledge, not promises and self-promotion.  These qualities, of =
course, serve men as well as women. Jim Collins,  author of Good to Great, =
argues that the most successful corporate  turnarounds were led by such col=
orless men as Darwin Smith at  Kimberly-Clark and William Allen at Boeing. =
Through a combination of  deep knowledge of the corporation, personal humil=
ity, and will, they  created enduring greatness. It's too early to say whet=
her Anne Mulcahy,  No. 6 on our list, can pull off such a feat. But she fit=
s the profile.  An unpretentious workhorse who never aimed to be CEO, she f=
elt  ambivalent accepting the title at troubled Xerox in July. "I'm not as =
 famous as Carly--and I want to keep it that way," says Mulcahy, 48.=20
The famous Carly--Hewlett-Packard Chairman and CEO Carleton Fiorina--is  st=
ill No. 1 on our list, as she has been every year since we began  publishin=
g the The Power 50 in 1998. She still heads the biggest company  ($48.8 bil=
lion in revenues last year) run by a woman. And she is still  as audacious =
and impatient as ever. Wall Street practically heckled her  latest move--a =
bold bet to buy competitor Compaq--but Fiorina, 47,  remains defiant. In di=
fficult times "people who drive change are the  subject of great scrutiny,"=
 she says. As a woman--and a daring,  outspoken one at that--her actions ar=
e scrutinized more closely than the  most driven of men. Says Fiorina: "I'v=
e had a lot of male CEOs say to  me, 'Thank God they don't rank us.' " =20
PepsiCo President and CFO Indra Nooyi (No. 10) understands the urge to  tak=
e bold action, but she also knows the necessity of holding back.  "There is=
 no question that women who reach the top have to perform at a  higher leve=
l--which is why women tend to push themselves harder than  men," says Nooyi=
, 46. "But we have to have the right people around who  can say to us, 'You=
're draining the organization. You're pushing too  hard.' " Particularly no=
w, as the U.S. prepares for an uncertain kind of  war and enters what could=
 be a sustained economic downturn, power seems  to call for pragmatic and c=
areful leadership.=20
This year's Power 50 is full of such steady leaders. Mulcahy, Nooyi, and  t=
he other corporate women who are new to the top ten this year--Mirant's  Ma=
rce Fuller (No. 5), Pfizer's Karen Katen (No. 7), Chevron's Pat Woertz  (No=
. 8), and Kraft's Betsy Holden (No. 9)--are all low-profile  loyalists. The=
 combined tenure at their current companies: 118 years.  The six years Andr=
ea Jung (No. 4) spent as head of marketing at Avon  gave her the knowledge =
to revive the troubled company faster than anyone  expected when she became=
 CEO two years ago (see It Took a Lady to Save Avon ). =20
As always, the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time. Last  year,=
 power resided in the technology and Internet sectors, but that  influence =
was fleeting. Gone from the list this year: "Hurricane Debby"  Hopkins, who=
 pushed her agenda too ambitiously at Lucent and lost her  CFO job in May; =
Ellen Hancock, who failed at the startup Exodus; and  Morgan Stanley's Mary=
 Meeker, who influenced so many to buy into the  Internet fizz. But one Web=
 warrior looks better than ever: eBay's Meg  Whitman, No. 2 on our list. Wh=
itman, who at times took heat for not  managing aggressively enough, has ne=
ver overpromised investors; instead  she has diligently delivered above-tar=
get profits every single  quarter.
While the economy and its points of power change, the definition we use  to=
 evaluate power remains the same. We consider the size and importance  of a=
 woman's business in the global economy, her clout inside her  company, and=
 the arc of her career--where she has been and where she is  likely to go. =
When appropriate, we also weigh the woman's influence on  mass culture and =
society. That factor lifts Oprah Winfrey to No. 3 on  this year's list. She=
 owns a product, The Oprah Winfrey Show, that  generates more than $300 mil=
lion in annual revenues and reaches 26  million viewers in the U.S. each we=
ek--plus millions more in 106  international markets. Her show, and now her=
 magazine, O, The Oprah  Magazine (whose subject is personal empowerment), =
have immense influence  on the popular culture--from what books people read=
 to what kind of  lives they lead. =20
The shifts on our list this year are dramatic, with 14 newcomers and  three=
 returnees from previous years. But one trend is especially  intriguing: Wo=
men are taking on bigger businesses than ever. A few years  ago responsibil=
ity for a $3 billion business almost automatically earned  a woman a spot o=
n this list. No more. (Unless she wields media power  like Martha Stewart, =
No. 13.) This year's FORTUNE 50 includes several  women who lead businesses=
 with annual revenues of $20 billion or more.  That's a first. The ranking =
has become so competitive, in fact, that  some women moved down even though=
 their power increased. Example: Shelly  Lazarus. She heads a healthy busin=
ess, ad giant Ogilvy & Mather (where,  by the way, she has worked for 30 ye=
ars), whose revenues grew 20% last  year. Plus, she added a prestigious boa=
rd seat--General Electric--to her  resume. But in order to make room for ne=
wcomers, Lazarus slides to No.  11, from No. 7 last year.=20
One newcomer is Southwest Airlines President Colleen Barrett (No. 20).  Loy=
alty and self-knowledge took Barrett to corporate heights she never  imagin=
ed while growing up in tiny Bellows Falls, Vt.  Barrett couldn't  afford to=
 go to a four-year college and had no specific ambition beyond  believing s=
he "would be the best legal secretary in the world," she  says. Barrett sta=
rted as Herb Kelleher's secretary in 1967, a decade  before he quit a Texas=
 law practice to launch Southwest Airlines. She  made an indelible mark as =
the startup grew to be America's  top-performing airline. In her job as exe=
cutive vice president of  customers, she helped create Southwest's famously=
 collegial culture and  provided essential structure and discipline to Kell=
eher's grand vision.  "I've never wanted the CEO job," says Barrett. "I don=
't think I have the  talents for it. I'm a great No. 2 person." Now 57, Bar=
rett is exactly  where she wants to be. =20
Loyalty does not mean kowtowing. The women on our list push their  companie=
s to change and grow, and they take personal risks. "Women have  to take a =
lot of risks because there is no natural career progression,"  says Mirant =
CEO Marce Fuller. She should know. Fuller was getting great  marks running =
international project development for Mirant's former  parent, Southern, in=
 1994, when her boss asked her to take charge of the  company's tiny North =
American power plant operations. After looking  closely at the business, sh=
e told her boss she didn't want the job  unless she could do something alto=
gether new--build a high-tech  risk-management and marketing organization t=
o complement the expansion  of power plants in the U.S. "I told him, 'If yo=
u don't have this piece,  you don't have a game plan,' " she says. It wasn'=
t an easy sell. Only 35  at the time, Fuller lobbied Southern's board for a=
pproval. Once she got  it, she built a 600-person energy trading and market=
ing unit that is  expected to generate $25 billion in revenues this year. S=
outhern, a  regulated utility, spun off Mirant last spring. So now Fuller i=
s her own  boss--and, with Mirant sure to be among America's largest compan=
ies this  year, a FORTUNE 500 CEO.=20
One of the few. The grim news is that there are only six women CEOs of  FOR=
TUNE 500 companies, including Fuller. And there are fewer women in  the pip=
eline than anyone would have thought 30 years ago. "When I was  21, I was e=
xpecting that by this point we'd be in the fifty-fifty  range," says Betsy =
Bernard (No. 23), CEO of AT?Consumer. The reality,  though disappointing, h=
as motivated Bernard to become "a catalyst,  making sure that other women g=
et opportunities." Bernard, 46, and other  women emerging now are not based=
 on the old model--the shark-like Linda  Wachner, whose company, Warnaco, c=
rashed into bankruptcy this year. Or  the flamboyant Jill Barad, who was bo=
oted from Mattel last year. Says  PepsiCo's Indra Nooyi: "PepsiCo, which us=
ed to be known for hiring  'Pepsi pretty'--blond, blue-eyed males--has made=
 an Indian woman its  president. That says a lot about the future of women.=
" Let's hope Nooyi  is right. Meantime, if you don't see a new Wonder Woman=
 in corporate  America, it doesn't mean she doesn't exist. She might be qui=
etly and  diligently doing her job.=20
