RE:		EXCHANGE TO CHANGE EARLY CLOSING TIME FOR COAL

The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., announced today that it will change
the early closing time for coal futures to 12:30 P.M. for days that the
Exchange has designated for early closings.

These days include December 31, 2001, and January 18; February 15; May 24;
August 30; and December 24 and 31 in 2002.

The change reflects the abbreviated trading hours under which the Exchange
has been operating since September 17 and will remain in place until the
hours are extended. All other open outcry energy markets except propane
futures will continue to cease at 1:00 P.M. on those days. Propane futures
close at 12:15 P.M.  The early closing for aluminum and palladium will
remain at noon; silver and copper will end at 12:05 PM on those days; and
gold and platinum will close at 12:10 P.M. Electricity futures will close at
its regular time of 9 A.M.
