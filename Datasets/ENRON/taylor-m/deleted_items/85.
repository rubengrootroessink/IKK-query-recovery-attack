Nicola:

In follow-up to our telephone conversation, today's meeting is cancelled.  Could you advise everyone at your end?  The next meeting will be 2 weeks from today.  

Thanks,

Jeff

Jeff, 

I just wanted to check whether the Trading Meeting was actually taking place today (Justin wondered whether it would be cancelled as you have the All-Employee Meeting). 

Hope you are well. 

Kind regards, 
Nicola
