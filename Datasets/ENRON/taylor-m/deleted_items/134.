Mark, thanks for passing on the message from Linda.  I can't get through to anyone at work, either, but an email did go around telling folks to go home.  I'm also having trouble receiving calls as well, but email seems to work fine.  Hope you're doing well.

Hi Kayalyn - Linda asked me to forward this - I'm at my company's office
in London.

Am unable to call NYC from London - all lines busy.  I received your fax
and it looks fine.  I don't understand the last sentence of section 6.3
because of the cross reference to section 10.3.  Please check the cross
reference to section 10.3.  Thanks.

Linda

p.s. -- if you can get through you can reach me at:
Hotel - 44 (207)491-7282 (phone)
44 (207)491-7281 (fax)
Cell phone 44 7881 500 471

Hope everyone is ok - we are watching on CNN.
