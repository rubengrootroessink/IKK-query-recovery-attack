Hello Mark,

As indicated in my voice message the two officers Sheriff and Murphy are not here. I have attached the Power of attorney for your signature. I will try and call later this evening to explain further why we are in need of this particular POA. Alternatively, if you are content please fax a signed copy to me at 0207 783 1171 and forward the original to me. I can discuss where the board minute will be created with Teresa Calahan. Please note that your signature on the POA must be preceded by the hand written words  "good for power of attorney". Many thanks  Mark and apologies for the short notice.


Ian
