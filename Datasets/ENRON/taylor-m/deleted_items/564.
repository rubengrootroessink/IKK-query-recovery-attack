Makes sense. I'm sure he does. I've got 3 my self and there is a larger need for experienced coal traders. What groups will be hit hardest and did he provide any specifics about our group?

A few things. 
 
	- Mainly next week this floor will not be in high spirits.  The layoffs will be next week.  EGM and EIM will be hit  	  hard 
	- John asked about bonuses (also, mentioned he had 3 job offers).  George said should have an idea within a few weeks 
	- etc.
