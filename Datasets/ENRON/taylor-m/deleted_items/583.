NFL Reports, Player Updates 	
Latest NFL Player News - Provided by Commissioner.COM

Muhsin Muhammad <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=1203&>, WR CAR - Manchester United Updated 11/18/01
Muhammad sprained his left shoulder in Sunday's game against the 49ers. His status for the Week 11 game against Atlanta is unclear.

Mike Anderson <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=187481&>, RB DEN - Dirty Bastards Updated 11/18/01! Anderson rushed for only 31 yards on 13 carries against the Redskins. Olandis Gary carried the ball 10 times for 28 yards. It is apparent Anderson is no longer worthy of a starting spot on Fantasy teams, and Gary will continue to see some work at his expense.

Michael Westbrook <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=1310&>, WR WAS - Baton Rouge Idiot Updated 11/18/01
Westbrook caught nine passes for 104 yards and a TD at Denver. Opposing defenses are focusing on rookie Rod Gardner, and Westbrook is getting open often after starting the year slowly.

Jake Plummer <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=1003&>, QB ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/18! /0! 1
Plummer threw for 334 yards, four TDs and was intercepted once by Detroit. Such stellar performances are rare for Plummer, who may not have a better game this season.

Michael Pittman <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=12623&>, RB ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
The awful Detroit defense limited Pittman to 81 rushing yards on 23 carries. Don't start Pittman in any upcoming weeks unless your team is very thin at RB..

David Sloan <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=1331&>, TE DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Sloan caught two TD passes for a total of three yards at Arizona. If you ! ar! e desperate for help at TE, consider Sloan, who always gets regular looks from Charlie Batch.

Lamont Warren <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=1112&>, RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Warren rushed for 32 yards and a TD at Arizona and caught 11 passes for 64 yards and a score. The Lions will continue to feature Warren on third downs and near the goal line as a receiver, making him a good Fantasy backup for the rest of the year.

Warrick Dunn <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=1171&>, RB TB - Bees Updated 11/18/01
Dunn caught 12 passes for 138 yards against the Bears, but he rushed for only 12 yards and fumbled twice. Don't count on Dunn for consistently good Fantasy numbers during the next few weeks. He can be explosive, but he is also erratic.

Keyshawn Johnson <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=1265&>, WR TB - Baton Rouge Idiot Updated 11/18/01
Johnson caught 12 passes for 89 yards against the Bears, but he failed to get in the end zone again. Don't depend on Johnson down the stretch unless your team is very thin at wideout.

David Terrell <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=235247&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Terrell ca! ug! ht one pass for 15 yards at Tampa Bay. The rookie wideout is not consistent enough to start for most Fantasy teams.

Marty Booker <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=133228&>, WR CHI - Anorexic Drunks Updated 11/18/01
Booker caught seven passes for 165 yards and three TDs at Tampa Bay. In his third season, Booker has become a superb Fantasy wideout. He is a player you must start every week, no matter what matchup he faces. 

Plaxico Burress <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=187385&>, WR PIT - Bees Updated 11/18/01
The Jaguars limited Burress to one catch for 13 yards. The second-year receiver has still not proven he can be a reliable Fantasy player.

LaDainian Tomlinson <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=235249&>, RB SD - Bees Updated 11/18/01
Tomlinson put up decent rushing numbers against Oakland, posting 68 yards and a touchdown. His overall statistics have been down in recent weeks, however, which may have something to do with the fact that he held out for the entire preseason. 

Hines Ward <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=12795&>, WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Ward caught nine passes for 112 yards and a TD against Jacks! on! ville. While he doesn't score often, Ward has become a very solid receiver for Pittsburgh this year, and he will always post respectable totals.

Doug Flutie <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=12375&>, QB SD - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Flutie's recent struggles continued against Oakland, throwing for only 98 yards on Sunday. Unless he faces a good matchup, starting Flutie is becoming somewhat of a gamble. 

Stacey Mack <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=134327&>, RB JAC - Manchester United Updated 11/18/01
Mack was held to six rushing yards on eight carries at Pittsburgh. He has not been a reliable back for the Jaguars or Fantasy owners this season.

Rich Gannon <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=1034&>, QB OAK - Mandeville Marriage Updated 11/18/01
Gannon had a solid outing against San Diego, throwing for 311 yards and four touchdowns. He's one of the top five Fantasy quarterbacks in the league and is a must-start every week. 

Jerry Rice <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=1291&>, WR OAK - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Rice had a huge game on Sunday, catching eight passes for 131 yards and three touchdowns against San Diego. R! ic! e may not be an every-week starter in smaller leagues, but he can certainly still put up huge Fantasy numbers when the matchup is right. 

Tony Banks <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Banks was carted off the field in the second quarter of Sunday's game at Denver with a concussion. He was replaced by Kent Graham.

Brett Favre <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=1028&>, QB GB - Team Sensitive Updated 11/18/01
Favre threw for 262 yards and two TDs against the Falcons, but he was intercepted three times and lost a fumble. Despite some inconsistent play in recent weeks, Favre's potential for big games makes him a must-start every week.

Corey Bradford <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=12234&>, WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Bradford caught three passes for 117 yards against Atlanta. The Green Bay wideout is still too inconsistent to be considered a solid Fantasy player.

Chris Chandler <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=1004&>, QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Chandler started at Green Bay, and threw for 352 yards, two TD! s ! and two interceptions. He remains a good Fantasy backup when healthy.

Bob Christian <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=1077&>, RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Christian rushed for 40 yards and caught five passes for 62 yards at Green Bay. The Falcons are using him more often, and Christian makes a good backup RB right now.

Elvis Grbac <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=1035&>, QB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Grbac threw for 261 yards, two TDs and was intercepted four times by the Browns. The veteran QB has been a big disappointment this year and should not start for most Fantasy teams.

Jason Brookins <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=192266&>, RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Brookins rushed for 89 yards on 21 carries against the Browns. The rookie is a servicable, yet unspectacular Fantasy player who should give you some occasional TDs down the stretch. 

Tim Couch <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=133260&>, QB CLE - Bees Updated 11/18/01
Couch threw for only 144 yards and was intercepted three times at Baltimore. The Cleveland QB appears to be a risk even as a Fantasy backup right now.

Benjamin Gay <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844! &k! ey=245054&>, RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Gay saw his first extensive action of the year, carrying the ball 18 times for 56 yards and a TD at Baltimore. He displayed good vision and lateral quickness, and Gay is definitely worth picking up if you need help at RB. 

James Jackson <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=235220&>, RB CLE - Clubbers Updated 11/18/01
Jackson (ankle) did not play at Baltimore. Benjamin Gay and Jamel White shared carries in his place. 

Lamar Smith <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=1160&>, RB MIA - Manchester United Updated 11/18/01
Smith rushed for only 53 yards on 19 carries against the Jets. Smith appears to be mired in mediocrity right now, and he is a risky start unless you lack depth at RB.

Chris Chambers <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=235203&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
The rookie wideout caught only two passes for 25 yards against the Jets. Chambers is still too inconsistent to start for most Fantasy teams.
