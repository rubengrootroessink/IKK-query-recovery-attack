There's good news from this Tuesday--yesterday.  Dad passed his medical
exam for his pilot's license!  We went out and celebrated last night.  It
was nip and tuck on the eye test, that was the one he was worried about,
but he passed!

If you have time--in today's Wall Street Journal there are some
interesting articles, especially the first one below:

Page A20 - "How Did Afghans Become Bad Guys?"

Page A22 - Capital Journal - "After the Terror, God Reappears in Public
Life"

Page B1 - "In Cataclysmic Times, Workers Need Room to Rethink Priorities"

Thank you for letting us know that you are home.  We are glad too!

Love, Mother
