That sucks.  I am sorry.  I can't believe that are closing their entire
base there!    Crummy times all around.  Maybe one of the hotel things
from the luxury travel website will work out.  I think I saw a Paris one
and the St.John one is a steel if you can get flights and get away one
of the weeks that it is available.   Bill and I have tickets on hold for
$219 into Ft Lauderdale on Delta.  I think I am going to log back into
Orbitz and buy them now b/c stuff seems to be selling out.   Sorry about
the sailing.   I guess we should stick to off season.   - Amanda

I called the Moorings about a Miami charter over New Year's and they
said they are shutting down the entire location as of 11/30!  When I
asked about any other locations that might still have boats left, she
said they have a one week minimum for all charters at that time.  Sorry.
