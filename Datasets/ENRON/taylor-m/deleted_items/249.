Mark -- Since I have not worked that closely with the folks at Duke, I was
wondering who you thought the appropriate person would be to contact re:
resource committment for the ISDA documentation working groups.

Our contacts are:
Ashley Abbott
Randall Baker
Betsy Jacobs
Lisa Herrmann

Others?

As always your insight is greatly appreciated!  Hope all is well!  -- Stacy
