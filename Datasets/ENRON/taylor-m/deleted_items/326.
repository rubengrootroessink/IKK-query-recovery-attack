Notice Number:  01-440
December 21, 2001

TO:		ALL NYMEX DIVISION MEMBERS
		ALL COMEX DIVISION MEMBERS

FROM:	J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

SUBJECT:	Delivery Procedures


The Exchange proposes to amend the delivery rules for the metals futures
contracts by making permanent the temporary emergency rules enacted by the
NYMEX Board of Directors as a result of the attack on the World Trade
Center.  The proposed rule amendments would permit deliveries against the
COMEX Division's Gold, Silver and Grade 1 Copper Futures Contracts and the
NYMEX Division's Platinum and Palladium Futures Contracts to take place at
such location as may be mutually agreed upon by the Clearing Member taking
delivery and the Clearing Member making delivery.

The proposed rule amendments must be approved by the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission ("CFTC").  The Exchange Membership will be notified upon
receipt of CFTC approval.

A copy of the proposed rule amendments is attached.

Should you have any questions please contact Albert J. Getz at 212-299-2608
or Nick Galati at 212-299-2920.
