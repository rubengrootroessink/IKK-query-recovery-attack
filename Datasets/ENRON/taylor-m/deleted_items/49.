Limor,

FYI, the CFTC (Ron) were very appreciative of the fact Mark and or Alan responded to him so quickly. A note was made to the file and he will let me know if there are any followup questions. From his end, there are no further questions. He still does not know wheather DC will come back with further questions.

Regards, 

Al

I have spoken with Ron Carletta at the CFTC and explained our position - that is that as far as we know the LJM entities have only engaged in exempt transactions and are not required to register as CPO's.  He has my name and number if he has any further questions.
