Dear Mark,

Homecoming weekend for the Zeta Beta Tau Fraternity was the best we have had
in over 3 years.  There were alumni present at our Alumni meeting dating
back to the early 70's.  We would like to spark alumni interest back to the
current ZBT.  We encourage you to visit our web-site at:

http://department.monm.edu/zbt/default.htm

We think you will be impressed witht he events and progress we have made as
a chapter over the years.  We also want your feedback, so e-mail us back
from the ZBT site for any comments you want to make or questions about the
chapter.  Also check out starting on 10-25-01, a new page on our web-site
dedicated to ZBT alumni.

thanks,
Jerone Tyler
