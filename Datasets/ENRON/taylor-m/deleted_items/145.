Mark -

I have tried you at both the office and on your cell.  Your cell continues to state that all circuits are busy.  

I need about 15 minute to talk through a couple of CommodityLogic points that Tom and I reviewed this morning - mostly in relation to the "CommodityHub."  If you get a chance this evening or in the later afternoon tomorrow, please give me a call.  I will continue to try to reach you also.

Thanks.  Hope all is well.

Mark
