Carol,

As mentioned in my voice mail, attached are amendments we have requested Enron Corp. to issue with respect to: (a) ENA's & EPMI's physical power transactions, and (b) ENA's financial transactions with Allegheny.

Allegheny was familiar with Enron's amendment form, so in the interest of time I have used that form in crafting these amendments.

 << File: amendment ltr(allegheny energy supply)power guaranty.doc >>                    << File: amendment ltr(allegheny energy supply)isda guaranty.doc >> 

Cordially,
