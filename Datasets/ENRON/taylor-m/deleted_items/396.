Please find attached execution copies of the above captioned documents.  Please return by fax to me at 713-646-3490, an executed version of each by close of business, if at all possible; otherwise tomorrow morning will be fine.  I am also attaching a redlined version indicating changes from the original version sent by Joel Ephross.  Since your comments were in Acrobat Reader format, I was unable to redline against those changes.  Thank you for your attention to these matters.

Best Regards,
Barbara Gray
