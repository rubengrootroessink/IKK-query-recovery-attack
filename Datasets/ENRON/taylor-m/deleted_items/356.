EES also has an agreement with TradeSpark.  Let me know if you need more information.

Joanne -

I believe Pat was inquiring as to TradeSpark.  We have agreements with ENA and EPMI that were signed earlier this year.  I believe we also have one with EES, but this was negotiated by Will F.  We would have to check with him about the status.

Let me know what needs to be done on this matter.

Mark
