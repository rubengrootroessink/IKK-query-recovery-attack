RE:		Spot Month Procedures on the Eve of First Notice Day

Please be reminded that Friday, November 30, 2001, is the First Notice Day,
for the Gold, Silver, Copper and Aluminum futures delivery month of December
2001 (the new spot month).

On Thursday, November 29, 2001, the Eve of the First Notice Day, all Brokers
and Clearing Members must have a duly authorized, On-Line Trade Entry
("OLTE") system trained representative available until such time as the
Exchange deems necessary.

It is imperative that trades involving the Spot Month are processed and
cleared properly.  Therefore, representatives are expected to make a
diligent effort to process all Spot Month trades accurately.

Failure by any Clearing Member or qualified Floor Trader to show due
diligence involving Spot Month Trade processing may result in severe
disciplinary action by the Exchange.

If you should have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact David
Sherman at (212) 299-2061.
