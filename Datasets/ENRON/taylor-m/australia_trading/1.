Legal Mark following on from Paul Smith's email attached  are the revised 
GTCs.  I am advised your signoff is required prior to them being loaded into 
EOL . Essentially they are the previous HDD and CDD "Australian weather swaps 
GTCs. Each GTC has been amended slightly so it may be used for a product  
where the weather observations are derived from a source other than the 
Australian Bureau of Meteorology. I have reviewed the GTCs and confirm they 
are acceptable.


Would you please signify your concurrence by email.     


Tax I have seen a response from PWC yesterday that appeared satisfactory. 
Perhaps Susan or Heidi can confirm this  to Jeff who I understand also needs 
to give his signoff.

Dale attached are the final product descriptions.  Please call me if you have 
any questions.
