Mark,

I now attach a copy of an-email showing my amendments to the revised IT 
documentation which I have received from the OMLX.

Two points:-

1.  Do you have any comments on the OMLX's amendments (see below) (in my view 
their amendments take into account everything we wanted except per my 
revisions in my e-mail to Susan Gill below)  or my additional amendments?

2.  Have you yet heard from Houston IT / Telecoms Dept with any issues on the 
technical specs etc in the IT Licence documentation?  This is the only side 
of things which can now hold this up. 

Kind regards

Mark

Susan,

I refer to our brief conversation of yesterday afternoon, and have taken the 
liberty to make a few amendments to the revised drafts of the OMnet 
Agreement,  OM CLICK Licence Agreement and the Side Letter, all which I 
attach to this e-mail showing my amendments marked-up in blue.

For ease of reference, you will see that my amendments are to the following 
clauses:-

OMnet Agreement

 - to Clause 3.8

- addition of new Clause 8.2 (ii)

OM CLICK Licence Agreement

- to Clause 1.6

- addition of new Clause 5.4

Side Letter

- to Clause 2

- to Clause 4

I look forward to discussing these proposed amendments with you at your 
earliest convenience.

Please note that I am still awaiting to receive any comments on the technical 
specs and issues in this documentation from our IT / Telecoms Dept in Houston 
and therefore this is just to let you know that they may also require some 
further amendments to the documentation.  As soon as I have heard from them 
on this issue I shall let you know.   

Kind regards

Mark
