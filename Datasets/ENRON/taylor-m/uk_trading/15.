Mark,

I attach an e-mail which I have just received from the OMNLX setting out the 
extent to which they have been able to agree our amendments to the IP 
Licences.

Basically, they have agreed to everything, EXCEPT a limitation of liability 
clause protecting us in the event of a breach of the OM Click Trade Agreement.

I do not see how they will move on this as this is the second time that they 
have refused it ( they have agreed to put one in the OMNet Agreement however 
- which is slightly perverse).

Anyway, you will see that they require Enron to sign these by Friday of this 
week!!

If you can see your way to approving these documents - I think that we have 
got 99 % of what we required and hence they are ok -- I can get the OMLX to  
e-mail clean copies directly to you for signature.

I look forward to hearing from you. 

Kind regards

Mark

Many thanks, Susan - I have forwarded these on to Legal Dept in Houston with 
my recommendations.

I shall let you know when Houston Legal gives me their approval to the 
documents so that you can e-mail them directly to Houston Legal.

Kind regards

Dear Mark,

I have just heard from Stockholm. Please find attached the agreements marked 
up
with the amendments in so far as we are able to agree to them. I think we have
been able to accomodate the principles behind your requested amendments 
detailed
in your email of 30th April.

I understand that the line installation has been ordered for this Friday -
before the line can be installed I will need 2 signed copies of the OMnet
agreement returned. Please let me know re emailing the engrossments to you.

Many thanks

Susan
