Dave,

Carol Chew has raised some concerns with me regarding the offering of EOL 
Singapore Products in Japan.  This is as a result of a conference call that 
she participated in yesterday with Morten Erik Petterson, Joe Hirl and John 
Chismar. 

During the conference call Carol was informed that all GTC's,counterparty 
approvals,credit limits, tenor limits covering the trading of Singapore 
products in Japan have been drafted and approved by the US Legal & credit  
teams.  Carol is concerned that if all Singapore products are to be offered 
in Japan, that all legal and credit approvals for the products and the 
counterparties trading them should really be made by the relevant UK teams.  
This is due to the fact that all OTC products currently traded in Singapore 
are governed by UK law and UK credit regulations.  

Please could you advise how I should now proceed with this issue.  I have 
spoken to Justin Boyd about this and he has said that he has had no 
involvement in the approval of products to be traded in Japan.  Should I now 
be asking Justin to review the Singapore products types with the view to them 
being traded in Japan? 

Thanks

Anna
