I knew there was a reason we decided to go with "Lookalikes"!

Dave,

After hearing of Mark Taylor's concerns on using 'Lookalike' in the short 
descriptions, we canvased the traders who would be affected (Metals and 
Liquids) to get their views.

Below are Chris Mahoney's comments.  

Regards,
Lara

They are futures being traded online and if we call them swaps that might 
confuse customers because in
the oil market swaps are always considered to be full calender months and 
price out on a daily basis.  
for example if we have dec swap instead of dec lookalike that will have two 
different meanings to the mkt.  
the former be a full month swap with daily pricings and the latter being 
being a swap that has the same dates 
as the futures contract with a one day settlement.   I think we would be 
making a mistake changing for these
reasons.
