Can you go to this URL and find some pools near our hotel? Preferably 50 
meters, or at least pools that sound fabulous.? 
http://lornet.com/SGOL/query/Search.cfm.? Also, for my reference , will we be 
staying in central, south, north, east or west London?? This will help me 
locate pools.? Also are there Web sites for London that I can go to in order 
to help me find things to do while you're working?

Thanks.
