Hi Kevin,

I had another conversation with Andy and the final word is that we will 
require traders to make leg 1 of the product active and visible on web. We 
need to make sure that our product description wording reflects this.Sorry 
for the confusion.

Hi Kevin,

I spoke with Andy and he is in agreement with the change that I made to the 
product description. That is while we will encourage the traders to show leg1 
prices on the website it is not a requirement.
