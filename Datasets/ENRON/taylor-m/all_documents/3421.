Do you think we should continue to use Paul Pantano on this matter?

I would think because of the history he has, we should, but I wanted to get

Dear Alan:

     Please let me know if you would like our help preparing/reviewing Enron
Trading Services' risk assesment filing with the CFTC.  My recollection is 
that
it is due in November.

     Regards, Paul
