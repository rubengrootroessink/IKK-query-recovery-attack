Attached please find the above captioned documents for your review and 
comment.  Note that although the Bridgeline Risk Management Policy is 
referred to in the attachments, it is NOT attached hereto.   It, however, 
will be attached to the final version of each of these two appointment and 
authorization documents.  I have prepared a form of Guaranty which may be 
used for gas purchases and/or sales by Bridgeline Gas Marketing, L.L.C. and 
also in connection with swap and option agreements.  Please review these 
documents and call if you wish to discuss the same.  Since Ted Murphy of the 
Enron Corp. Risk Control Group is out of the country for the entire week, I 
presume that Rick Buy, the Executive Vice President of this same group will 
execute these documents as the Chief Risk Control Officer.  If this is not a 
correct assumption, I request that Vlady please let me know.  As we discussed 
Vlady, can you please talk with Rick about these documents.  I would of 
course be willing to discuss these with Rick if you would like.
