 Do You Know Where Your Assets Are? iVita Does
Thursday, November 30, 2000

iVita arrives on the e-business scene with a unique value proposition. It
provides enterprises with a mechanism to track, value, and allocate assets
with the goal of optimizing asset utilization, increasing cash flow, and
improving financial controls. The iVita Web-hosted system provides a
repository for information on the status of physical assets, the market
value of the assets, and the financial implications, including tax
treatment, of the different uses of the assets. In essence, it provides
business intelligence for asset management. iVita is currently working with
several enterprise customers as well as the Pantellos and NetworkOil
exchanges, but it will be sometime next year before we see the results of
the first pilots.

The iVita approach to asset management is different from the typical
Enterprise Asset Management (EAM) approach. Most EAM implementations deal
with the procurement and maintenance of plant assets. As long as the asset
is performing the task it was procured for, the EAM application will track
it and manage its maintenance. However, if the asset becomes idle, it
quickly disappears off the EAM screen. Yet, from a financial perspective the
asset is still on the books. Maybe it can be deployed in another plant or
facility. Maybe it can be sold as surplus through an online exchange. Maybe
it should be scrapped for tax purposes. In most organizations, these
questions go unanswered for long periods of time because the asset is no
longer visible. iVita provides that visibility over the Internet so that
financial departments can make timely decisions for asset deployment or
disposal.

Some, if not all, of the functionality iVita provides can be created as part
of an EAM implementation using applications from vendors such as Indus
International and Mincom. However, a complete EAM implementation, with
financial integration, will consume considerable time and company resources.
It may also take years to implement. And at the end of the project
enterprise-wide asset visibility may not be available because the data is
locked up in plant-specific implementations. By focusing on a specific
problem--asset visibility from a financial perspective--and providing the
visibility as a Web-hosted service, iVita has reduced implementation time to
weeks and reduced the time it takes to get a Return on Investment (ROI). The
approach will appeal to users tired of long implementation cycles with
difficult-to-measure ROIs.--Leif Eriksen
