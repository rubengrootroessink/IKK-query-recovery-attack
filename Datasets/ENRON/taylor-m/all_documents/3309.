I have informed Taiwan counsel of the metals we plan to trade. They are now=
=20
checking which products are restricted or prohibited for both oils and=20
metals. In any case, the responsibility for applying for import approval=20
would be that of the Taiwan counterparty being the importer of record.

Some further clarifications on IV Issues relating to EnronOnline:

3. "No" is intended to mean there would be no "doing business" exposure to=
=20
Enron marketing and transacting via the internet.

5. "No" is intended to mean that the Taiwan counterparty would remain liabl=
e=20
for a trade done by an unauthorised person using the Taiwan counterparty's=
=20
password.

My proposed summary would be:

Taiwan

Generally free to trade physical/derivatives oil and metals.
Certain commodities may be restricted/prohibited. Await additional advice o=
n=20
which commodities are restricted/prohibited.
Importer's responsibility to obtain approval for restricted/prohibited=20
commodities.
Local counterparties are permitted to purchase USD50 million each calendar=
=20
year beyond which Central Bank approval required on a case by case basis.
Possible withholding tax impact (up to 20%) on deivatives income.


Hope the above is helpful

Matt

Angela, Matt

Thanks vey much for this. =20

So far as the physical metals are concerned, these include copper, nickel,=
=20
aluminium, lead, zinc and tin.  If you need any further information, please=
=20
let me know.   It may be sensible at this stage also to ask counsel whether=
=20
there are any restrictions concerning other physical crude products (not ju=
st=20
liquid fuel).  In the interests of time, you might find it quicker to put i=
n=20
a call to counsel on these points.

If you could also prepare a short description for the purposes of the=20
EnronOnline weekly report (say by this Thursday) - this should be reasonabl=
y=20
simple since few issues appear to remain.  The format of the last one I=20
prepared is attached for your info.

Thanks.
Justin
