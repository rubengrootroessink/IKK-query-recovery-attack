This is a fairly aggressive schedule for meetings.  I am not sure that we 
will have any updates of worth every three days.  I think Andrea should be 
taken off of all work other than EOL and gas and electricity sales until EOL 
is online if this is the kind of pressure Mike wants to put on this issue.  
As it is Andrea does not have a lot of time to devote to this issue.  What is 
your suggestion?

This is to remind everyone on our scheduled EOL meetings. These will be held 
as from next Monday 24th, until the final implementation. This week, Michael 
and myself will meet in Houston with everyone in that office who is included 
in this implementation process.
Please give me your comments.
