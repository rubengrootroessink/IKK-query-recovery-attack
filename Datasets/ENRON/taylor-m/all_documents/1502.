lets try to work through this one.  it will be a good example of potential 
energy deals and give us a good feel of how far out of the zone this is or 
whether it will simply take some work.

Unfortunately, it's not quite that simple.  Duke Energy Trading & Marketing 
is a marketing sub and does not prepare separate financials.  The S&P rating 
is based on an implied guaranty from Duke Energy.  Legal would also need to 
review this counterparty from the standpoint of confidentiality agreement 
violations. 

Also, as a trading counterparty, Sempra Energy Trading is not authorized for 
credit derivative trading, because the existing guaranty does not explicitly 
cover this type of transaction.  If Sempra wishes to transact out of this 
entity, we can look into amending the guaranty to cover this product.  This 
will require legal efforts and approval.

Both of  these entities have an E-rating of 3. Any issues?
