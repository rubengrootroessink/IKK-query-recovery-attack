Jay,

On the Bid Submission Forms, please relocate the buttons to the bottom of the 
page and In place of where the buttons now appear, please insert:

"Please read the following Rules and scroll down to the buttons at the bottom 
of the page in order to submit your bid/offer".

EnBank should be similar, with the following text:

"Please read the following Rules and scroll down to the buttons at the bottom 
of the page in order to submit your bid".



Thanks,

Dave
