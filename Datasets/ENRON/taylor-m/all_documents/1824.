Mark

In your FAQ, you might like to outline the contract structure in some detail, 
for eg:

* the counterparty contracts with Enron North America re: PA
* contracts with ENA re: ETA and 
* contracts with Singapore re: GTC

Was there any particular reason that you chose the PA to be with ENA rather 
than Enron Japan.  Note, Australia was done for the Australian market.

I would prefer to change it to Enron Japan. Will we have to receive further 
external advice? If not, I will change it accordingly.
