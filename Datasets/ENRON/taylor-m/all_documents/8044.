Mark:  I am attaching the resumes of two Enron employees who are interested 
in your open position.  Marie Heard is here in Houston at EBS.  Tracy Cooper 
is presently in Portland.  Her husband, Bob Cooper, works for Enron as well, 
and they will be relocating to Houston shortly.  Tracy will actually be in 
Houston April 3,4, and 5 so she would be available for interviews then.

I have the resumes of several other qualified candidates, but I know that you 
wanted to try the internal route first.  Actually, both of these candidates 
look pretty good!   Give me a call with your thoughts, and we can move 
forward with scheduling interviews for you.

Please call me with any questions
