What we need to accomplish in the next few days:

Dave Forster and Mark Palmer will develop and finalize the demo that will be 
used for pitching the sale.  Dave and Mark will create two demos, one which 
shows how Enron uses the tools/system(s) and two, a demo on how a company 
such as Carghill would use the tools in a private application.  This will all 
then be set up so it can be shown on the road or in house to clients.  Dave 
and Mark have started this work today.

Mark Taylor will work the following two legal issues in parallel:  First, 
find outside council that will be able to help with the internal audit of all 
legal contracts associated with EOL as well as be able to assist in legal 
matters associated with the due diligence and assist in contract work 
associated with the actual sale in the future.  The legal audit must be 
prepared and completed by early next week so we can keep our planned visit 
with i2 late next week and feel comfortable that we can sell we are proposing 
to sell from a legal standpoint.

Jay will complete the technical audit and write up his conclusions (or Kevin).

Rex and Greg will continue to refine the list of potential clients and the 
appropriate contacts on the list.  Any suggestions on how to make sure we 
have the right names, etc. just send them in to Rex.

Rex will also refine the actual presentation to be used in the pitch and get 
a copy to Louise in the next day or two so she can review the content of it.

We will also need t o have a separate timeline/calendar that shows who we are 
seeing when, etc.

Any other thoughts or issues from the team?
