Cy-Clones, 

Some photos from the recent Woodlands and National meets are on our web site 
at: 

http://users.ev1.net/~sturgeon/swimming/swimming.htm 

Note that some of the photos are quite large so they might take a couple of 
minutes to download if you have a slow modem (like we do...). 

Enjoy! 
Jon Sturgeon
