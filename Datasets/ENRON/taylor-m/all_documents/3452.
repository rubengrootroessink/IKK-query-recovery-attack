Sebastian,

I look forward to your response tomorrow on the issues raised by Mark Taylor 
and myself the end of last week.  

In addition I wanted to request that you review your answers to our questions 
in section 10 of the legal survey in order to ensure that we cover other 
financial and physical transactions that are traded on the Enron website.  
Your responses outlined in your memo are focused on the gas and power 
products that will be traded by our Argentine trading entities, however, 
there may be any other number of products traded online by non-Argentine 
Enron entities including:
 Commodity transactions relating to oil, gas, electricity, weather, pulp and 
paper, metals or other commodities, whether derivative transactions (cash 
settled) or physically settled.
 Financial derivatives - i.e. interest rate, foreign exchange, or credit 
derivatives.

Please let me know if you need any clarification on the additional issues we 
would like covered.

Regards,
Brent
