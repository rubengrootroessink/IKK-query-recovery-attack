OK, then we set it at 3:30 Houston time (5:30 BA). Andrea will attend.
I will confirm the call in number.

Mark and I are both unable to attend at that time. 

Can we reschedule for either 11:00 or after 3:30 Houston time?

I assume also that Andrea will attend. I would very much like her input, as I 
understand she is the one who raised the enforceability issue.

Mark and Dave,

 Last week, we met with a local "Certifying Company" called GIRE. Their 
service is based on the "Asymmetric Password Method" . We believe that using 
their services in the process of granting passwords to our local clients will 
contribute significantly to the enforceability of our transactions from a 
legal stand point. We would like to discuss this issue with both of you to 
determine if it is worth while to consider this alternative.
Is everyone available at 12:00 noon Buenos Aires, 10:00 am Houston?. Please 
confirm.

Regards

Patrick
