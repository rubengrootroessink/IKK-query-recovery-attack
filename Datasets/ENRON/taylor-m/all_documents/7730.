Mark,

At Greg Johnston's request, I am forwarding to you copies of two proposed EOL 
products the Canada office would like to set up for trading on EnronOnline.  
Both products are financial and are using the EnronOnline derived daily index 
price.  Please let Greg know if these products are approved for trading.  In 
the meantime, I have forwarded copies to the EOL team in order that they can 
start working on setting the product up for trading.

Thanks!

Dianne
