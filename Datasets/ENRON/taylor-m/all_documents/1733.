Some interesting information in here, although it would be nice to see 
answers to questions, like:

- What geographic regions are covered?
- Is anyone using them?
- Are prices firm?
- Are postings reliable? (i.e. always there)

Bob/Amita: Not sure if you can gain a view access to prices for any of these? 
May help to validate our own bid/ask.

Dave
