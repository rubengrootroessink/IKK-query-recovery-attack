Mark:

For some strange reason I was looking at the Enron corporate listing on the 
Martindale-Hubbell website and came across your name.  I hope that you are 
doing well.  Frankly, I didn't know that you had left NYC, but it appears 
that you  joined the Liddell Sapp alumni crowd at Enron some time ago.

Things here in Nashville are quite busy.  Sarah and I (who, miraculously, for 
reasons far beyond this short note, are still married!) spend most of our 
time keeping up with our three kids:

Henry (3 months old when we went to Steamboat in '84) is now 17 and a junior 
in high school.  He is somewhat the brilliant eccentric.

Laura, who was born a few months before we moved in '88, is a 5'8" 13-year 
old seventh grader who thus far bears the burden of being the "perfect 
child." (I am sure she will get us back for that!)

Bobby, born in '92, is a second grader who, in may ways, is a "miniature 
Gordon."  (Poor kid.)

Oh, yeah, I am still an ERISA nerd.  All that boring stuff is on our website.

If you ever get up anywhere near Tennessee, please come see us.

Best wishes,
