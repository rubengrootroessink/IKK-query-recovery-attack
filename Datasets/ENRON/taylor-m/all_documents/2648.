Dear Derivatives Week Subscriber: 

I thought you might be interested in this breaking news story reported by our 
sister publication, BondWeek: 

==================================================== 
Persistent buzz that had Nomura Securities International shuttering its 
mortgage derivatives desk and liquidating its portfolio is completely 
unfounded, 
according to Nomura's fixed income chief Alex Noujaim. Rumors that Nomura 
was bailing from the CMO market have weighed on the market for more than 
a week and gained credence from a research report put out by a rival firm. 
====================================================
