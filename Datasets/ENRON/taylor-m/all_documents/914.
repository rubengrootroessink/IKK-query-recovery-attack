Alan/Harry,

I can't remember which of you two lucky souls are looking after coal.

We have modified the Coal Products somewhat. 

Previously, we showed Product Types for US Coal Nymex Phy Fwd, US Coal 
PRB8400 Phy Fwd and US Coal PRB880 Phy Fwd.
We are in the process of replacing this with a single Product Type: US Coal 
Phy Fwd, which has various delivery locations. This is more of a logical 
change than anything else, and the long descriptions have been edited only 
slightly from what was there before. Please review the following and let us 
know if it meets your approval.

Thanks,

Dave
