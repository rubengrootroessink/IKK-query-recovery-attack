Attached hereto is a revised list of the contracts that we discussed at our 
meeting yesterday.  In the column  labelled comments I have tried to 
summarize the consensus of the commercial and technical people as to the 
relevance of each of the agreements.  Please take a few minutes to review and 
let me know if your notes from the meeting coincide with my comments.  
Thanks.  I would like to get this to the business folks this afternoon for 
their review as well.
