Mark,

I would like to contact you in order to follow up to your conversation of
last week with Mr. Chuck Cerria regarding executing an ISDA between numerous
Hess entities and numerous Enron entities.  Unfortunately, I do not have
your phone number.  Could you either call me or e mail it to me?

Thanks so much,

Dana Dellacona
