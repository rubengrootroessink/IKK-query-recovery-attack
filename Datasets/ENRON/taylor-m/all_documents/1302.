Nick-  I have discussed the Weather Web Site confirmation templates with Mark 
Taylor. We think it would be best at this point to use the regular EEFT 
"Deemed ISDA" Confirmation Templates rather than the EOL Confirms. Since your 
Confirmations person has the EEFT Deemed ISDA Confirms already set-up on 
their system- it would be the easiest to ask them to use those formats and 
then insert the following to create the confirms for the Site.    


1.  "DRAFT - FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY" - Place this in the Header of each 
page of the Confirm.

2.  "This Proposal is for discussion purposes only to facilitate the 
negotiation, preparation and execution of a definitive agreement governing 
the Transaction described above. It is not intended to create a binding or 
enforceable contract or to be complete or all-inclusive of the terms of the 
related Transaction. The consummation of such Transaction is subject to the 
execution of a definitive agreement containing all appropriate provisions, 
including those relating to credit and limitation of damages and remedies." - 
Place this in the Footer of each page of the Confirm.

3.  Signature Block.  Block out both signature blocks of the Confirm and 
replace with "Draft".

The Site may need additional legal disclaimers. Mark & I are working on these 
and will get back w/ you next week on what we would recommend. 

Kind regards, 

Shari
