I think the concept that has been added regarding the equity quotes is OK, 
but the result is still not sufficient.  The agreement allows Enron to cancel 
that order if we cannot receive the consents, but there is no value returned 
to Enron for this loss of content.  Since the specific fee is waived in the 
first year cancelling the service does not impact the $1 million cost.  Yet, 
our commercial negotiation always reflected the perspective that these quotes 
had value.

Enron/Reuters Working Group:

Attached are revised Order Forms and a revised Terms & Conditions.  Please 
note
the following changes:

References to "Enron Corporation" have been changed to "Enron Corp."

A termination right for the data portion of the transaction has been inserted 
in
the Order Form for data.

References to "Distributor's Subsidiaries" have been added in the license 
grant
in Section 4.1 of the T&C as well as in the indemnification section in Section
14 to extend the indemnification protection by Reuters to Distributor's
Subsidiaries.  Because of the wider scope of the license, a Section 16.10 has
been added to make clear that if any of Distributor's Subdiairies breach the
Agreement, Reuters will look to Enron Corp. rather than the individual
subsidiary.  The reason for this is that although Reuters acknowledges that
Enron's subsidiaries may be involved in operating the URLs, Reuters does not
want to be put in a situation in which it has to search for the relevant
subsidiary to remedy the breach.

Mark:
I hope the added language addresses your concern regarding the protection of
Enron's Affiliates and the ability of Affiliates to participate in the 
operation
of URLs.  Please call to discuss if necessary (646-298-9571).
