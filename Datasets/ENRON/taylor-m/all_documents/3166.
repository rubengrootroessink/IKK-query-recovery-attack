John
I have just had IBJ on the phone again asking for a progress report on the=
=20
ISDA docs.  Have we managed to move this forward, bearing in mind Labour Da=
y,=20
since he is very keen to commence trading on Monday next.  He suggested tha=
t=20
he would be comfortable in trading prior to the implementation of the docs=
=20
for these initial trades as per Jonathon's previous comments in past mails.=
 =20
Are we comfortable doing this if we cannot resolve the issues on the docs?

They are also very keen to see the draft confirms for the proposed trade=20
(Steve, I have just heard from Rob in the vid conf that the proposed volume=
s=20
may prove difficult to take on the books??).  Please advise as to our=20
capability so that I can convey this to him in the morning.

Best regards
Tom

Dear Mr.Viverito

Attached Word file is ISDA draft amended by our legal desk.
(please take the amended points as our comment on your draft)
Please check it all and kindly reply ASAP.
(CSA is not acceptable as I mentioned you before, and we'll check your
LETTER OF CREDIT after
the schedule is almost agreed)

In your draft, we cannot understand the meaning of "EDGAR" on page4,
so please show us what it is.

We are very hoping to conclude this process rapidly.
So, I very much appreciate it if you could send back your comment before
Holiday in U.S.(4th Sep)
(it's ok if only the rough prospects of concluding ISDA)

Best regards,
Konishi IBJ Tokyo
