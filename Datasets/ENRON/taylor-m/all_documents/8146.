Hold on....legal is preparing all the documentation..please call Mark Taylor 
or Carol St. Clair before doing anything. NOTHING should be sent to PG&E that 
does not have Legal's approval as this is a bankruptcy and must be handled 
very carefully.

Please call if you have questions.

These are terminations of existing deals - they should NOT be confirmed.
