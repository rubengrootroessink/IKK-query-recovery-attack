Mark and Jeff,

Sullivan & Cromwell is preparing a memo from our discussions last week, and 
Ken Raisler will be in London on Thursday morning to discuss. We can 
connected you in (4.30am Houston time!) or update you later in the day.

How can we trademark a name?  EnergyML is the name for our standardized data 
language which E-Clearinghouse is developing.  How do we start the process?

Thanks,

David
