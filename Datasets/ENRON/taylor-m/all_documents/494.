As requested a "final" meeting has been arranged on Monday, 9th August at 
Clifford Chance (a room has been booked for the full day).  Could you please 
let me know asap if this is going to be a problem.  

I am waiting to hear from David Gilbert/Ken Raisler of Sullivan & Cromwell to 
ascertain who will be attending.  I will follow up this pm.

Andrew Wilkinson will not be able to attend this meeting - he is on paternity 
leave at present.

Thank you.

Regards.
