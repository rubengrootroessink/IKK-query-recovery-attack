Here is a managers' amendment that Chairman Leach of the Banking Committee
is considering.  I would imagine that section 10 would be of particular
interest to Enron, given that it provides unconditional legal certainty for
all wholesale, individually negotiated derivatives.  This provision may
prove controversial, and there is little time between now and our Thursday
markup.
