As a part of our efforts to make information more easily
accessible by our members, the State Bar of Texas
is pleased to let you know about two additions to:
http://www.texasbar.com
our web site.These new features will allow quick and
easy access to Minimum Continuing Legal Education (MCLE)
information at the click of a mouse 24 hours a day,
7 days a week.

MCLE Course Search Our new MCLE accredited course database
is searchable by many criteria, including course location,
date, subject area, and the number of hours approved
for credit.  The course listing on the web site is real-time.
This means that as soon as the approved course has been entered
into the database by the MCLE staff, it appears in the search
results on the web site.

Compliance Review

You can now review your MCLE record online for not
only the current year, but also for every previous year.
The State Bar of Texas is the first bar organization in
the United States to provide this "full view" of MCLE
compliance information via the Internet.  This secure
access service is accessible only by using the PIN that
will be assigned to you when you register online.

Accessing the MCLE Services To use these online MCLE
services, go to: http://www.texasbar.com
and click on "TexasBar Online."  This will take you to
the "TexasBar Online - Services Menu," which provides
access to the MCLE Compliance Review, Course Search,
and Application for Accreditation.

The first time you go to the Compliance Review service,
you will need to register online.  Immediately after
completing the simple registration form, you will be
able to view your MCLE compliance record.

Almost immediately, you will receive an e-mail message
which contains your PIN for use during each future visit
to the Compliance Review service.  Make a note of your
PIN and keep it in a secure place.If you should lose or
forget your PIN, simply go through the online registration
process again.  A new PIN will be assigned to you.

Of course, you may continue to get MCLE information by
calling 800/204-2222, ext. 2106.

In addition to the new MCLE features, we thought you might
like to know that the State Bar web site will be undergoing
a major renovation this spring.  Please visit:
http://www.texasbar.com
often to see what's new.

We hope you will find the MCLE features on our web site to
be helpful and we welcome your comments about them.
