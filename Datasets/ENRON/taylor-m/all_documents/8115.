Thanks - that should work fine now that the restricted list policy and risk=

management policy are consistent.

Cassandra,
I incorporated your changes to the Restricted List. The second and third=20
paragraph after the actual list is the exact language that you suggested. =
=20
The rest of the language in the entire email relates to the Chinese Wall=20
Policy and the only additional changes that will be made by the legal group=
=20
is they feel it is appropriate.  Keep in mind that I am only referencing th=
e=20
Risk Management Policy to a very brief extent, this is not meant to be a=20
summary of that policy.  This is a offshoot of the Chinese Wall Policy.  If=
=20
you have any questions, give me a call.  Thanks. Donna
