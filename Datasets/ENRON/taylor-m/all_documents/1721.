Attached below is the customer list for the Japan launch.  Initially, there 
will not be any Japanese products, so these customers need to be reviewed for 
the current product types on the matrix.  This will need to be completed by 
mid April in order to meet the launch schedule.  Please let me know if I can 
help in any 
way. 

Thanks!!!

Frank

Please find below the client list for the EnronOnline Japan launch, that is 
expected to happen on May 10. Please keep me updated on the pre-approval and 
migration to production processes.

As David mentioned before someone from the Tokyo office will be calling the 
Help desk to test our ability to deal with Japanese clients. This should take 
place during trading and late night hours.

Thanks,

Mario
