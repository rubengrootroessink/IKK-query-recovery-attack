Brent, Andrea and I were hoping you might be available for a 30-minute call 
on Tuesday after 5pm (BA time) or 2pm (Houston time) on Tuesday, Feb. 29.  
The BA office had a meeting last Friday afternoon and has apparently set some 
rather lofty goals, such as online trading for Q3, etc.  Please let me or 
Brent know if you are available and/or alternative times.  

Tomorrow we meet with the American Chamber of Commerce, Wed. with Marval and 
the ADA and the Securities Commission, and Thursday with tax consultants.  
Also, I need to talk with you about Brazil when I return.  Sami has been 
diligent about forwarding deal flow information and there are a ton of 
references to PPA's and SWAPS.  We are still trying to get our arms around 
all the business units in Brazil to track their activity.  Have you heard 
from Yao?  This international position may be right up his alley. Sara
