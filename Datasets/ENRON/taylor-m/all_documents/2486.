Edmund:

As you requested, attached please find the first draft of the revised Legal 
and Privacy statement.  David Gilberg with Sullivan & Cromwell has made at 
first pass at revisions.  I intend to review and revise as necessary and will 
pass on any revisions to you.  I look forward to any comments you may have.  
By separate e-mail, I am also forwarding to you a copy of a memo that David 
has prepared outlining various issues impacting Phase II content.

Attached are clean and blacklined versions of the Legal and Privacy 
Statement, reflecting my suggested additions and changes.  Please note that 
the bracketed language in para. 6 has been left in brackets because I am not 
sure if this disclosure will appear elsewhere in the document; if it does, it 
might not be needed here.

Please call or e-mail if you have any questions.  Have a good holiday.
