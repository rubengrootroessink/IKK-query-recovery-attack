Attached is a revised version of the ETA omitting the distinction between 
transactions on Match and transactions on Trade.   If Enron is the only party 
permitted to post product on Match, there is no need for the special rules 
that we drafted for what was previously a "many-to-many" matching site.  
However, we will need to develop a different set of GTCs for transactions 
that Enron closes on Match, since the products transacted on Match are not 
likely to be the type that lend themselves to Enron's standard GTCs.
