Alan and Mark,

  I received a call today from Donna Lance, a trading lawyer at Koch.  She is 
trying to put together a corporate compliance policy for Koch and asked if we 
would be willing to share our work product in this area with her.  The 
specific areas she mentioned were insider trading and conflicts of interest 
policies. I told her I would have to check with my friends at ENA.

  I wasn't sure what ENA's position was on this - so I thought I would run it 
by both of you.  

  Thanks for your help!
