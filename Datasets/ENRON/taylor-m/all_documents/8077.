Mark, we are trying to have everything completed so we could launch this 
product to go live on April 9th. Sara has already given us the approval on 
the GTCs for these FX products for external counterparties. The products do 
not have names as yet, but the FX team is working on it. Can you go ahead and 
review the GTC's for these products in the mean time and I will contact you 
with the names of the products as soon as we get them.
Thanks
jr
