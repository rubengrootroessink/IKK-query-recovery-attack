Mark:

I just received the ISN contract for the Olympics game.  Should I send a copy 
to Ed at Milbank as well?  Any reason Mark Holsworth needs to be involved?    
I have reviewed numerous license agreements and feel comfortable with many of 
the issues, but I do not hold myself out as an IP expert.  Have we entered 
into similar agreements with other content providers that would be good 
precedent for my review.

Dave,

Attached is a contract for the "Enron High 5 Flags" game.  I will touch base
with you this afternoon with some questions and changes to areas such as
with prizing and rules for the game.

I am just stepping into a meeting and will try tracking you down once it's
over.

Thanks,
Craig
