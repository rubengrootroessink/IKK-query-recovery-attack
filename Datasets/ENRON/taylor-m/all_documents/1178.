Mark,
This is a FYI:

I ran across a Terms of Use Statement which is likely similar to what we may 
need as part of our Enron customer internet site.  The statement is actually 
part of Coral Energy's website.  You can access the terms of use statement by 
going to the link below:

Let me know how things are going on the review and if I can be of assistance.
