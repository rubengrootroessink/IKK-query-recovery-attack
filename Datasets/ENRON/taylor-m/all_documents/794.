If U and Dave R happy that this is the final list of FAQ's for the Web we are 
waiting only on Legal approval.  They have already put , what were revised 
FAQ's into the guide.  I therefore need to know what has changed form that 
version to the FINAL FINAL legally approved ones, so that I can enter bugs to 
say remove this add that.

Mark, sorry for the continual approval but an immediate response by tomorrow 
morning would be appreciated.

Awais
