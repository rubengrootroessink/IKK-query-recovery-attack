Victor:

Overall, the presentation looks fine.  Just a few comments;

1.  When you display images of the countries' flags, show less than 50% of 
the flag if possible.  (Possible infringement issues if we depict the entire 
flag.)
2.  The Front Page:  Currently, if a participant can't win a prize, he can't 
play the game.  If you and Dave change your minds and decide to let such 
participants play, we need to add an express disclaimer following the 
statement re Japanese residents to the effect:  "Residents of _____________ 
can play the game but are ineligible to win prizes due to regulatory 
restrictions.
3,   Registration Page:  Update disclaimer regarding use of registrant 
information (currently in right-hand corner of page) as per my latest 
e-mail.  
4.   The last page refers to "Create your own groups".  I'm under the 
impression that we won't have groups.  If this is correct, we need to delete 
all references to groups.
5.   How To Play:  I understand that this section needs to be drafted.  
Please forward to Mark Taylor for his review when it is complete.  Be sure to 
avoid use of prohibited terms such as "Olympics", "Summer Games", etc. in 
this section.

Craig, 

per my voice message please find attached a powerpoint slide show that shows 
a front page that is indicative of the look we would like to have for all the 
pages, the old Gateway page with new text, followed by the "sorry you can not 
play" slide, then the registration page and finally "the how it all works" 
page. This is the sequence the pages should flow from the gate.  Please note 
the comments and language that is to be added to the pages (obviously the 
language needs to be incorporated in a more aesthetically pleasing manner 
than it is presently).

We are finalising the listing of countries that can play and the Official 
Rules.  We will send these to you as soon as we have them finalised. In the 
mean time could you forward us a copy of the "how to play guide" that the 
contestants will view for legal perusal.  

Please call me with any questions issues feedback you may have.  Also I would 
like to get a status report on the prizes.

Cheers

Victor
