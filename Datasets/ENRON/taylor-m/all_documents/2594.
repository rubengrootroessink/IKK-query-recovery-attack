We need to ensure that any Brokers (TrueQuote's own included) have no access 
to transactions entered into by Enron with other counterparties.  Also no 
access to the information behind the prices that isn't available to others 
using the website (ie stacks etc).  This would also apply to all of the 
others in fact I don't think we have restricted this in terms of the price/ 
volume information available to other equity players in the site.
