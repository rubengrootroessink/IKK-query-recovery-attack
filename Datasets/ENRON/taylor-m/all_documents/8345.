Chosen from more than 40 submitted poems, the winner of the Site59 Poetry 
Contest written by Megan Barnett is enclosed below! The sonnet structure and 
the rhyme of the word "procrastinators" really put this one over the top, but 
we got a lot of great submissions -- thanks to our Registrant-Poets -- and we 
may enclose others in future emails.* Keep an eye out!

A Sonnet for Site 59

When yet another weekend looms ahead
With only chores to occupy your time
Thoughts of laying 'round the house fill you with dread
It's time to call for help: Site 59!

No need to plan ahead or fear late fees,
The trip's arranged - And what is even greater
The price is one you can afford with ease.
A perfect site for all procrastinators.

In Chicago, walk the Mile and sing the blues;
A New York martini's sure to quench your thirst.
Go to Memphis and wear your blue suede shoes;
Visit Nawlins - eat crawfish 'til you burst.

Follow whimsy, seek out gaiety,
And fill each day with spontaneity.

*Note to the poets: If we enclose your poem in future email, we will notify 
you in advance and you will receive a t-shirt.



Live (and travel) spontaneously,
Patty
