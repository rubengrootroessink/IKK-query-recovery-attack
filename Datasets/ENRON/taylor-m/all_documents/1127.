Yes, why don't you send the insurance information to us.  We have
received three quotes from the local man representing the company who is
handling my new 401K plan.  We could compareall of them and then talk to
you about it.  How does that sound?  How much information is there?
Would it be too much to fax?  If not, you could fax it to my work number
on Friday when I am there.  I don't have the fax number here at home, but
I can call there tomorrow (Thursday,) get it and get back to you.

We got a little more snow yesterday, but nothing compared to what Phyllis
and Tim both must have gotten!  I guess they are setting records for
North Carolina.  It surely is cold here, though.  I had to go downtown
today and the wind blowing up and down the streets between the buildings
was really bitter.  Three international flights bound for JFK had to land
here and stay all night.  Delta nearly filled a 500 room hotel!  There go
our ticket prices up again!

Love, Mother
