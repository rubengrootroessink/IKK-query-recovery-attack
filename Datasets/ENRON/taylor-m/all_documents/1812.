Anna, thanks for your concern.  I don't think it's going to be a problem.

Felipe, as we discussed on the phone, try talking with netnames and see what 
they say.  I think, if it's easy to do both, then we could use the second one 
as a matter of course, but I don't think it's an issue: registering a domain 
name--a simple process, sometimes--is not the same as creating contracts and 
trading off them--a much more complicated effort.  (Cyber squatters, for 
example, aren't even the legal corporations whose domains they carry.)

Thanks for thinking about it, though!  (And if it all goes wrong I'm sending 
you and Felipe this email so we'll all know who made the mistake)

Jay

PS: If the lawyers have any objections, please make them known as soon as 
possible so we change our course of action.  Thanks!

Jay,

Singapore will be trading financial products not physical on EOL initially. 
With this in mind should we  use the second legal entity in this case?  I was 
not sure whether this was a minor detail to consider when registering the 
domain name.

Dear Tiong

I need to know Enron's "registered business comapny number" in Signapore in 
order to register www.enrononline.com.sg, as well as the office's contact 
details, and Angela Connelly suggested that I contact you to obtain this 
information.

Could you supply me with this information?

Thanks in advance

Jay
