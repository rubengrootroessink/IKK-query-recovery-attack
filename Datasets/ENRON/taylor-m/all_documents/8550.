Mark,

Please call me re: verbatim use of wording between EOL and Confirms.

Also:

PCGs are checking back with confirms people regarding index descriptions and 
location, to make sure things are properly covered off. They are also going 
through the descriptions to identify cases where traders have grabbed 
incorrect items against the products they have created. Additional system 
controls are going in today and into next week to stop this sort of error 
from happening.

Dave
