Because of the issue Andrea raises in the email below I think it would be a 
good idea for you to meet with Mike.  I also think Andrea should participate 
by phone since she is most familiar with the CNV and other legal issues that 
will impact EOL trading in Argentina.

To tell you the truth, I'm not sure I fully understand the purpose of their 
trip.  Mike seems to want to be able to carry out financial transactions on 
shore (through and Enron Argentine vehicle and with Argentine CPs) through 
EOL.  Although there are probably other issues on their agenda, I'm sure they 
will want to meet with Lynn to specifically discuss this matter.  I am 
currently preparing a legal memo on the current status of the bill that would 
amend the bankruptcy law.  I will give you an update just in case you decide 
to join them for the meeting.  

Andrea

Does it make sense for us to set up a meeting with you participating from 
Buenos Aires?  I'm not sure we have much to tell them at this stage - 
actually, I'm sure I don't have anything new to report but if you do that 
would be fine with me.

Michael and myself are planing to be in Hoston on Thursday and Friday of this 
week. We intend to see as many people as possible regarding EOL 
implementation. We will meet Dave Forster and his team among others. We would 
like to fit a meeting with you as a group or individually. 
Please let me know about your availability and if it is possible to meet with 
more than one of you in one place.
Thank you
