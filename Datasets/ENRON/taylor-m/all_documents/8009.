The Caterpillar Foundation Board has approved a $1 million grant to Monmouth
College, specifying that the gift be applied toward the college's $5.5
million campaign to completely renovate Hewes Library.
"We're pleased and grateful that the Caterpillar Foundation has provided us
with this magnificent gift," said college president Richard F. Giese. "This
will help us realize our goal of providing future Monmouth College students
with a library that is second to none and allow them access to the most
advanced learning tools possible."
Work is expected to begin this summer on the renovation, which will entail
an extensive update of the building's technological capabilities. Library
experts believe the library of the future will be more reliant on
technology, with increasing amounts of data and information stored on and
accessed with computers. Hewes Library currently has a traditional design,
as it was built before the advent of electronically-stored information. The
renovation will make the building more accessible to technology, creating a
new high-tech electronic classroom and study areas with Internet
connections.
The plans also include a significant redesign of the building, providing a
library that is more aesthetically pleasing. The changes will enhance the
atmosphere in the library by adding air conditioning and will provide more
exterior light by adding new windows and skylights. Other major improvements
include a new entrance on the east side of the building and completion of
the third floor, which was left unfinished during the original construction.
In addition, a new coffee shop is planned for the current Pi Beta Phi Lounge
to make the library a social center as well as a learning center, and the
first two floors will be completely remodeled.
