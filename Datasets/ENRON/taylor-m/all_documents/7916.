Why would it matter who had a guest ID?  I think I am missing something.

Brent

Would be grateful for your thoughts on this.  It seems to me that provided 
Enron is not marketing LME Metal Futures from WITHIN Peru/Brazil, then we 
ought to be able to give local C/Ps a Guest (or view only) ID?

[This would mean that we should not give a Guest ID to Merche Clark, the 
metals agent in Brazil]

Thanks.
Justin

Can we give Guest IDs for LME products to Brazil and Peru?
