Mark,

Powerex agreed to execute our GTC - as written - for our deal. They would  
prefer to put in their suggested changes for any future deal (prior to the 
execution of an enabling agreemente). 

Please advise on whether or not their suggested changes are acceptable.

Regards,

Bill

Mark, can you have a look at the proposed changes suggested by Powerex below 
to our Canadian form of financial trading GTC and contact Bill Greenizan of 
the Calgary office to let him know whether the proposed changes are 
acceptable or not?  I think they have done the swap already and need to paper 
it.

Thanks

Greg

Greg,

Prior to doing the one-year trade with Powerex I forwarded the traders over 
there a copy of our GTC (identical to the Duke contract).

The traders got the following feedback from their legal / contracts people. 
Their main concern is the language in section VII.

Let me know if you have any comments and what changes (if any) we should make 
when we send Powerex the confirmation for the Cal 2001 contract.

Thanks

BIll
