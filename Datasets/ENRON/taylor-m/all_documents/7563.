Simon - Justin tells me that in his view there are no issues from a UK 
legal/regulatory point of view , other than the following:

As a matter of 'best pratice', the broker(s) concerned should mention 
somewhere in their terms and conditions that their 'commission may or may not 
be shared with third parties' in order to comply with SFA rules 

Hope this helps.

Justin - any thoughts re: Simon's question? Would we still be within our 
legal and regulatory rights to accepting a 'cut' of a broker's commission 
fees, assuming we ended up doing what Simon suggests as opposed to the 
EnronBrokerConnect approach (different business/revenue model)?

Thanks,
Paul

Andy

Actually what I was referring to was a deal between UK Power and GFI Net, 
which would not necessarily involve EOL.
There would be several benefits for us to do this, as detailed in my previous 
mail.

My question is: Do you know of any issues that would prevent us from 
accepting a per trade payment (passthrough of a % of bro) from GFI? If not, 
do you know who has looked at this sort of thing?

Thanks
Simon

Simon,

Re GFI:

We had been discussing an EnronBrokerConnect license for them. This is the 
deal whereby they get a stripped down EOL web client that allows them to 
transact on behalf of customers. This was initiated on behalf of the 
Conntinental Power desk. GFI has been un responsive to date.

If they have changed tack and want to put EOL numbers on the GFInet site they 
need to let me know that. So far it's been tough dealing with these guys.

Andy
