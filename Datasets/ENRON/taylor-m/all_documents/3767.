Subject: Bullion Due Diligence

Dear Mark, David and Peter,

We have been asked to carry out due diligence so that we can trade Bullion on 
EnronOnline and have instructed local counsel with respect to the list of 
European jurisdictions I have been given.  The products involved so far are 
Gold, Silver, Platinum and Palladium.   The other jurisdictions that would 
fall under your remit are as follows:

Mark: USA
 Peru
 Mexico

David: Australia

Peter: Canada

Kind regards, 



Justin Boyd
