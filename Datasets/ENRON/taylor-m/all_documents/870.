One more update:

I tried to change the departure date, but the flights are all sold out on
Saturday and Sunday (they would have changed them free of charge).  I have
included a map of the area and the Airline has told me that they are
planning now on resuming flights to St Thomas as of 9pm tonight.  They also
just told me that since we are pre-confirmed customers on the San Juan to St
Thomas we will not get bumped off the flight to accommodate previously
cancelled customers - especially in the middle of an active trip.  That is
good news.

Looks full steam ahead.  Bruce - just a tactical question for you - do you
want to move to St John on Saturday if there are not a lot of penalties to
do so?  Could be fun to see the other island.

 I spoke with the Hotel in St Thomas - all systems go for now - they
seemed totally unfazed by the entire thing.  They have the reservation and
no problem.

 The Airline has cancelled all flights from San Juan to St Thomas for
today.  They did not have an outlook at this time for tomorrow.  They
suggested we check in as early as possible tomorrow so that we keep our
confirmed seat assignment from San Juan to St Thomas in case there are a lot
of stranded people trying to get there as well.

 Does anyone have a projection on the storm's movement by tomorrow
morning?  I feel really dumb - I don't even know which island on the map St
Thomas is. (see the attached pictures)

 If the flight from San Juan to St Thomas is cancelled, we will be
stranded there and have to take a flight out at a later time and need to get
a hotel in San Juan.  I have not yet asked them to change our departure date
as a pre-caution - that is next, but I think that causes problems with the
air fare.

 Here are some pictures I found on CNN.com.
