This isn't quite how I recall it looking yesterday. If my memory serves me
well, your sketch showed - all in one line:

"You want to buy 20000 from Enron"

What you have sent today shows:

"You want to buy 20000...
[product short description]
from Enron for 2.18"

To me, this is less clear. Would it not be simpler, and completely
unambiguous, to state:

"You want to buy from Enron 20000
[product short description]
for 2.18"

Similarly, "You want to sell to Enron 20000
[product short description]
for 2.18"

Regards
Christopher
