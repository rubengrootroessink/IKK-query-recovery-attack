Mark, as discussed, please find attached for your review and approval the 
long descriptions of the three financial power products that Enron Canada 
wants to trade on EOL.  Please let me know if you have any comments or 
concerns with the attachment, so that we can commence the process of getting 
these instituted on EOL.

Thanks

Greg
