Further to my converation with Mark Taylor, I understand that there are some 
potentially substantial changes to the Australian GTC in the works.

Please advise as to when the redrafted GTC is expected to be available. If 
necessary, we will come into the office this weekend to upload it.

Thanks,

Dave
