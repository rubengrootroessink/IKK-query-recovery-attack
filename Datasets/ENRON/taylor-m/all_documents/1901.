Alan

Rather than give you evolving advice, I would prefer to wait until both our
regulatory and tax reviews are complete, but pending those:

Re reference to "commodity" - you are correct - if another word can be found 
it
might be better to avoid the word 'commodity' if the letter (or brochure) is 
to
be translated into Japanese since the translator may chose the same word as 
the
offending Japanese word in the law.

Re the reference to adding products "local to Japan" - this is getting very
close to the prohibition on dealing in products for which a "market" exists in
Japan and I would prefer to leave it out at least until we finish our 
regulatory
review.

Re the address to which applications are to be sent, pending our reviews this
should also be outside Japan.

Regards

Paul

Attached is a marked draft of my fairly quick attempt to revise John's draft
cover letter to help mitigate Japanese law/regulatory risks and separate EJ 
from
Enron Online, an offshore business initiative at this point.

Paul: Please review and add your comments.

Susan: Please review from a tax perspective, and provide your comments.

Per our discussion earlier today,  attached is a draft of the letter we 
propose
to send out from Joe Hirl on Enron Japan letterhead during the week of May 8.
