> Comment:  Congresswoman Maloney is a senior Member of the House Financial
> Services Committee and was heavily involved in the CFMA on energy issues.
> I think it is safe to say that she was not sympathetic to the benefits of
> affording regulatory relief to the energy markets at the beginning of the
> debate but after a lot of work (by many of you!) she came around to
> understanding the benefits of innovation and establishing a positive
> regulatory environment.  Industry education was very effective.  The
> restaurant is marginal but continued work with Congresswoman Maloney is
> worthwhile.
