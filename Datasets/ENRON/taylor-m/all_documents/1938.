Dave,

Attached for your review, please find a clean draft of the above-referenced 
Agreement.  Please note that there are several provisions which I have 
highlighted for your special attention.  This Agreement will require several 
additional changes after you provide me with the payment tables.  Please call 
me at 3-9720 with any comments or questions.

Jason
