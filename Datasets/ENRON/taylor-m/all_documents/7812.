Jane - 

Not to back-pass the issue, I think this is generally a Legal question.  From 
the Credit perspective, our concern is Enron's ability to:
- Call for collateral
- Receive it and hold it
- Have title to it/perfect it in case of default
- Retain it in the case of bankruptcy to offset exposures

If we agree to accept it in yen or dollars, in Japan or the U.S., from my 
perspective, it is important that we simply identify the necessary legal, tax 
and operational procedures, then implement the processes that allow Enron to 
accomplish the above criteria.

If I need to address these issues in greater detail, or if you need anything 
further, please let me know.

Dear Susan,

I am not really sure what the answer is to your question and I am not really 
sure whether these decisions are ultimately made by legal or credit although 
I suspect the latter.

John or Carol, do you have any thoughts?

Jane,

I am guessing that in practice, Enron Japan would not accept the tender for 
collateral in the US for transactions it enters into in Japan.  However, 
would you please confirm this?

Best regards,
Susan

Ed,

I am attaching the memo that you wrote last May on the Japanese tax
consequences of financially settled derivative transactions and physically
settled transactions.  I have also attached copies of current ISDA and
Credit Support Annex ("CSA") Schedules.  I need you to review the ISDA and
CSA Schedules and revisit and comment on your attached advice as necessary.

Also, I need you to give more specific advice with respect to collateral.
We generally take and give as collateral either cash or letters of credit.
We should assume that cash may be pledged in Dollars or Yen and that it may
be held in the US or Japan.

As always, I appreciate your help with this matter.  Would you please let
me know if you can provide comments by your close of business on Thursday?

Best regards,
Susan
