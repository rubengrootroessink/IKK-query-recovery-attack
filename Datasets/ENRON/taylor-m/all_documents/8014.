Good morning,

Just a heads up to let you know that there is a new product type awaiting 
your approval (currently "Partially Approved") in EnronOnline Datamanager. It 
is an Australian power financial spread product (#2001) and will be an 
inter-regional spread using the existing financial power swap products i.e. 
VIC, SA, NSW & QLD peak & flat products as the underlying contracts.

Our senior legal counsel in the Sydney office, David Minns, has indicated 
that the existing GTC for Australian power products (see attached) can also 
be used for this new product type.

I would appreciate it if you could review this as soon as possible. Please 
let me know if you require anything further.

Note, a sigma factor (4.07) has been assigned by RAC which will be amended 
after the product type has been approved.

Regards,

Justin Timothy
PCG - Sydney
