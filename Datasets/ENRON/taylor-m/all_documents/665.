Jennifer,

Here is the language which should be used for Gas Daily. It has been revised 
and approved by Mark Taylor:

Daily price midpoint example (For Gas Daily, Oklahoma-PEPL):

The Index for a day shall be the Daily Midpoint price published on such 
calendar day under the heading "Daily Price Survey" in the Oklahoma - PEPL 
section of Gas Daily, or if a calendar day is not a business day then the 
price used shall be the Daily Midpoint price published on the next succeeding 
business day.


Please proceed with subsituting as required to complete the index updates.

Thanks,

Dave
