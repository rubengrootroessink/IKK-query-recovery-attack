Elena,

The Phase 1 "invite" will presumably have a lot of the information defaulted 
(i.e. pre-printed on form) e.g. Counterparty Legal Name, yes?

Bob,

PA is Password Application Agreement, which is 1 page legal document that 
must be signed by the customer.
System Admin. in the other company may be a Trader as well, I assume, and in 
addition it depends on this company internal policy how they'll manage ETA 
acceptance process.... 

Thank you for your comments, decision about which alternative to choose for 
unknown customers has not been made yet .... Louise?

Re Marketing Pack, Rahil is working on it. 
David Port and Arfan are developing the forms. First draft of Customer 
Registration form is attached herewith.

Elena,

Some queries/comments.

1. Existing Enron Customers (approx 2,000)

The first person from the customer's company logging Online has to accept 
ETA. After that ETA has to be available for viewing and printing for all 
other users.
The first person logging on will always be the Administrator (to set up his 
users) so how can a probable non-trading user accept ETAs for his traders?
PA = Password Application, right? Hadn't heard of this until now.


3. Unknown Customers (currently not trading with Enron) willing to get 
Trading Access
Alternative 1 most closely mirrors what we're doing for our existing customer 
base and so the procedures will already be in place for EOL Product Control / 
System Admin to run this. If the marketing pack mailing method is utilised we 
cut down on extra effort in a number of areas (marketing pack will be signed 
off by legal, business processes already there, no extra development effort, 
single point of reference).


Any chance of seeing what format the marketing pack / application is in so 
far? We'll need to make sure that the information we're requesting is 
comprehensive enough from a systems' perspective.

Thanks,

Bob

Subject: Registration Process Questions

Last two days showed that there is a big confusion on how exactly the 
registration process is going to work. The issue is very important and urgent 
as it may cause changes to the scope for Agency.com, and changes in the ETA 
and PA documents text.
 
The registration process appears to differ for different customer groups and, 
to my understanding, the latest was agreed as below. Please provide your 
comments or any corrections to the following:

1. Existing Enron Customers (approx 2,000)

will receive marketing Pack via mail approx. 2 weeks before the system goes 
live. The Marketing Pack will include PA (for an appropriate jurisdiction) 
and Registration Forms with questions about the customer (name, address, 
e-mail, taxable entity etc.) 
customers will fill in Registration Form, sign PA and mail it back to Enron
After the customer is approved for Online Trading by Enron, it will receive 
IDs and Passwords that customer's Administrator will grant to individual 
traders in that company
The first person from the customer's company logging Online has to accept 
ETA. After that ETA has to be available for viewing and printing for all 
other users.

Q:  Will PA be available as well as ETA for viewing and printing in the 
"House"?


2. Guest Users ( also referred to as Read Only Users) - Regulators, Lawyers, 
Brokers, Potential Traders etc.

will phone or sent e-mail (possibly fill in a form online, that will be 
automatically e-mailed) to Enron System Administrator. Customers will provide 
info on their name, e-mail address, mailing address, country of incorporation 
etc.
If Enron approves the customer as a Guest user, the System Administrator will 
e-mail customer Guest ID and Password.
When the customer logs in for the  first time as a guest, it'll  have to 
accept Read Only ETA on line. Read Only ETA will depend on the guest's place 
of incorporation, i.e. the system has to recognise the customer when it logs 
in and display an appropriate Read Only ETA. Without accepting Read Only ETA 
"Guest" user won't be able to view anything in the House.

Q:  1) Should Read Only ETA be printable and where?
 2) What limitations will be imposed on the Guest User, i.e. one log in 
session, limited time etc. - This decision has to be made in order for CC to 
put an appropriate language into the Read Only ETA. Read Only ETAs for all 
jurisdictions have to be finalised by July 7th.
 3) In the Garden there must be a sentence (to be drafted by CC) to inform 
potential Guest User that his request for Read Only access may not be granted.
 4) Is Read Only ETA accepted online or it should be signed and mailed back 
to Enron as a hard copy? The latest agreed was that it will be signed off 
line, but accepting it online should work as well, and seems to be a cleaner 
way...

3. Unknown Customers (currently not trading with Enron) willing to get 
Trading Access

There are two alternatives possible.
Alternative One: Off Line Registration

Potential Customer will e-mail, phone to express their willingness to trade 
online, i.e. get the ID and Password
Enron will mail Registration Pack to the Potential Customer with PA for 
appropriate jurisdiction
Customer will fill in Registration Form, sign PA and mail it back to Enron
If the customer is approved for Online Trading by Enron, it will receive IDs 
and Passwords that customer's Administrator will grant to individual traders 
in that company
The first person from the customer's company logging Online has to accept 
ETA. After that ETA has to be available for viewing and printing for all 
other users.

Alternative Two:  Partial OnLine Registration

Registration Pack including PAs for all jurisdictions will be available in 
the Garden
Customer has to chose (drop down box) which jurisdiction he is in,  print out 
appropriate Registration Pack and PA,  fill in Registration Form, sign PA and 
mail it to Enron
If the customer is approved for Online Trading by Enron, it will receive IDs 
and Passwords that customer's Administrator will grant to individual traders 
in that company
The first person from the customer's company logging Online has to accept 
ETA. After that ETA has to be available for viewing and printing for all 
other users.

Q:  1) Alternative 1 or 2?
 2) In the Garden there must be a sentence (to be drafted by CC) to inform 
potential customers that there request for Read Only access may not be 
granted.
 3) Should all ETAs and PAs be available and printable in the Garden? CC 
prefers them to be available...

Regards,
Elena
