Travis,

Attached is a revised section of our Access Agreement relating to the
enrononline link.  The language is that provided by Enron that you wanted us
to contain in our agreement.  However, the CFTC wants revisions to this part
as shown by the redlined changes before the No-Action Letter will issue.
Please review and get back to me.

Also, during our conversation with the CFTC today we were again asked the
status of the representations we must make re insider trading and any
potential disqualifications re 10% investors.  Please let me know as soon as
possible whether Enron has any problem with this.

Joe Wright
