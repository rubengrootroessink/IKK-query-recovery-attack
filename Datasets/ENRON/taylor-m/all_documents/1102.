The reason I have not responded is that we are currently reviewing the impact 
of Agency's recent actions on the delivery of the project and also reviewing 
the invoice received from Agency which I think you would be interested to see 
a copy of.

We will be scheduling a conference call to discuss at some point today.

Regards

Subject: Agreement



Louise:

Below is my understanding of our agreement. Please let me know if I
missed something.

1) We agreed to a penalty of 12.5% through the end of Release 1 (defined

as the official launch)
2) AGENCY.COM should immediately send the 'softlaunch' invoice
representing T&M fees plus Jessica licensing fees to Jay and Enron will
process it for payment promptly.
3) AGENCY.COM will create an 'softlaunch' acceptance letter that will
include a statement indicating that both parties agree that the penalty
is set at 12.5%. This letter should be signed by both Paul and Jay.
4) Enron wants to set up a seperate maintenance and support effort for
Post-release activities. Paul and Jay will work to define this
engagement. The penalty will not apply to this engagement.

A sincere thank you for reaching an agreement on this in a simple,
straight-forward manner. I do appreciate it.

Dave

I understand. Anything you need from us you're not getting? I'm in NY. I'll 
be back in the office
Thursday. Maybe we can touch base then.

Thanks,
Dave
