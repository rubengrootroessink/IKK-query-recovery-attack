Subject: Master Netting Agreement





Attached below is our preliminary draft master netting agreement. As we
discussed last week, the draft is designed to be relatively simple and "user
friendly," accommodating a single Enron entity and a single counterparty 
entity
engaged in cash settled and physically settled transactions under separate,
pre-existing, respective financial and physical master agreements similar to
those which you have provided to us as examples.

We note a few points about the attached draft:

1.   The terms "master netting agreement" and "master netting agreement
participants" in Section 6 refer to proposed definitions that would be added 
to
the Bankruptcy Code upon enactment of the pending legislation. If an agreement
is executed with a counterparty prior to enactment (or if the legislation is 
not
enacted), we would amend this provision to incorporate instead the existing 
safe
harbor provisions to the extent possible.

2.  We designated Texas law as the governing law (in brackets) based on the
provisions of the ISDA schedule you provided to us.

3.  Notwithstanding that the draft contemplates a single Enron entity, we
included references to Enron affiliates in certain provisions to provide
flexibility in the event that obligations from other Enron entities to the
counterparty should arise in any other context. We think that all such
obligations should be available for setoff against Enron's claims against the
counterparty.

Please call us when you have had an opportunity to review the draft.
