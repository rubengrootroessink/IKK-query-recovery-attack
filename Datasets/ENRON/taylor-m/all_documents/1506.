Mark,

The ETA does contain some redlines (Tools/Highlight Changes). Not sure if 
these reflect changes from NA or not - perhaps David Minns can shed some 
light?

Mark,

We have customers who are now filling out the new form of the Australian PA. 
As a result, we will need an Online Australian ETA very shortly.

Can you please approve/disapprove of the ETA form forwarded by David Minns? 
(copy attached). Once we have your approval, we will put it on the system.



Thanks,

Dave
