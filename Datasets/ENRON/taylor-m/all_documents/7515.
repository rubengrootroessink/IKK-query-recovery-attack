Let's see if we can get together in Rex's office first around 8:30 AM 
tomorrow. 

We basically want her to see what the audit includes, the status, and the 
time for its completion, both legal and technical.  We will also show her the 
outline for the presentation and let her know how and when we plan to proceed 
with it (ie, after the audit is completed).

Let Rex or I know if you can't make the 8:30 before the 9 AM.  Also, this 
will be a regular weekly meeting for us.

Thanks.
