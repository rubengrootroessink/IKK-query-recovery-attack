Mark,

Attached is an early draft of text for the proposed TransWestern Capacity 
Auction site.

I am sending it to you now only to give you a heads-up that this is in the 
works and is referred to in the document as a "Transwestern" Auction, as 
opposed to an Enron Auction.

Leonardo is the point man on this.



Dave
