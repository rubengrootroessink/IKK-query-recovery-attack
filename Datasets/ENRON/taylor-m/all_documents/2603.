Steve -- that's great.  I think the Net Works commercial team is becoming 
enthusiastic about the entire concept of patent protection.  Quick question 
-- we want to indicate "patent pending" on the websites -- is there a 
convention as to how that is indicated -- such as an abbreviation ("U.S. 
Patent Pending"?) or rule on where that indication is placed on the site or 
in proximity or relation to the company's name?
