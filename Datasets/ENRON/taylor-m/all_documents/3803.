One of the Windward Islands of the West Indies Lesser Antilles, it
is known as the "Helen of the West" because of its beauty. Natural
wonders and gentle people who seem to grow from the earth itself
distinguish this land of lush mountains in the south and
clustered, three-floored resorts in the north.

(7) IT'S NOT EASY BEING GREEN
When it comes to the environment, perhaps it's a New Millennium
thing: What was once considered soapbox spouting from the fringe
left is now a mainstream value. In turn, top hotel chains are now
promoting their commitment to globally responsible practices.
http://www.TRIP.com/news/completetraveler.cgi?a=3D4

(8) SLEEPING ON THE JOB
The Berkeley is part of the Savoy Group of Hotels, an ultraluxe
chain of five properties in England and France, and which has its
beds specially made -- by hand, no less. Guests are so enamored of
them that they have even visited the little factory (then Savoy
Bedworks, now Savoir Beds) where artisan-craftsmen make them.
