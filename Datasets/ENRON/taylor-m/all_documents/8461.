Lorie -

Sorry for the delay in responding.  I have no comments on the content,=20
however, the disclaimer at the bottom needs to be changed.  I have attached=
 a=20
draft of the language I think works best and is consistent with similar=20
pieces promoted by other Enron UK affiliates.

Please let me know if you should need anything further.
