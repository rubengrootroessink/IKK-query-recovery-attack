Jim, thanks for being so responsive.  Attached please find the latest draft 
of term sheet for the Joshua Tree transaction.  We continue to negotiate with 
the banks but want to get this to you so you can get up to speed on 
transaction structure.  Basically, banks would invest in certificates of a 
Delaware business trust of which Wilmington would be trustee.  The trust in 
turn would be the limited partner in a Texas limited partnership.  The 
managing partner of the limited partnership would be Enron North America 
Corp. or another Enron subsidiary.  The limited partnership would invest in 
volumetric production payments.   Note that names given in term sheet for new 
entities may change.

Tim Proffitt is the Enron commercial lead on this transaction.  John Rain of 
Thompson & Knight (Dallas) is our outside counsel.  Robin Miles of Bracewell 
& Patterson (Houston) is representing Bank of America.  Thompson & Knight is 
doing initial draft of trust agreement (starting with Margaux form).

Let us know particulars of your team and counsel (names, firms, office and 
home contact info) and we will add them to the working group list and 
distribute.  The goal is to have this transaction closed by December 15, 2000.

Thanks again and let me know as you need additional information.

Regards, NJD
