There are only two of the Herman Miller mesh chairs in this office.  As you 
know I was planning on bringing my chair back with me since I would need it 
in Houston.  Scott Porter I believe brought the other one down.  One of the 
commercial guys wants to propose to Mike that this office buy my chair from 
ENA legal and that I get another one when I get back.  I expressed some 
disatisfaction with the idea but agreed to check with you to see what your 
thoughts were.  I am not sure how a credit from one business unit to another 
would work in practise and I do not know if it would be possible to get 
clearance a second time for one of these chairs since the first time caused 
so many waves from others on the 38th floor who wanted one as well.  I do not 
want to give up this kind of chair now that I have had it for a few years.  

Any thoughts on this one?
