Mark:

I am forwarding this e-mail to bring you up to date on space planning for the 
new building.  As you can see from Mark Haedicke's e-mail below he wants the 
three of us to meet with Marilyn Archer so we can give feedback to Wes 
Colwell's assistant.  I will call Holly so I can schedule a mutually 
agreeable time for you, me and MEH to meet with Marilyn Archer.  

Thanks.

Let's schedule a meeting for Mark Taylor, you and me with the consultant who 
we already had conversations with.  We can formulate our response.  Mark

Pursuant to your request, I called Deborah Bubenko regarding what information 
she needs from you regarding space planning for the new building.  Deborah 
had Kim Kaase (extension 35349) return my call.

Listed below are the next steps:

Review the space plans and give your comments
You mentioned one of your major concerns is size of offices
Provide information regarding any speciality areas such as the number of file 
rooms, the number of conference rooms the department needs, etc.

In summary, the next steps are to determine the requirements for the 
department and then schedule a meeting through Tammy Shepperd (Wes Colwell's 
assistant) to provide them your feedback.
