Lynne,

Thanks for the e-mail.  I have spoken with our lawyer, Mark Taylor, and he is 
available at 10:00 am Central time on Wednesday  for a conference call.  
Unfortunately, he has a conflict at 9:30.  Please let me know if this is 
acceptable for the team at Reuters.

thanks
Dave

Dave, per our last telephone discussion, below are the standard Reuters 
Investor
contracts.  After speaking with Stanford Lin, he will strive to get the 1st
draft with agreed upon revisions back to you by tomorrow afternoon.  I would
like to set up the Reuters/Enron conf. call with both legal parties and me 
(and
if you feel appropriate with you) for Wednesday at 9:30 a.m. central time.

I will forward the AT&T conf. call number and password to you tomorrow.  If
there is a conflict with 9:30 a.m. central time, please let me know of Enron's
availability.  Stanford is available anytime from 9:30 a.m. central through 
the
remainder of the day.

Thanks!
Lynne
