At this point, the following applies:

1) European Customer Profile Due Diligence on existing EnronOnline customers 
(for determining whether or not the customers may ultimately be granted 
Execute status or not) has been completed or the UK and Finland, but is 
outstanding for Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland.

2) North American Customer Profile Due Diligence on existing EnronOnline 
customers is complete. Canadian customers cannot have any access and there 
are no insurmountable reasons why a U.S. customer might not have Execute 
Access.

3) There are 5 approved Reference Entities - Expected to be 25 by tonight or 
tomorrow.

4) There are 50 Company Profiles with Execute Status.

5) Everything is in place technically to have the Reference Entities and 
Customer Profiles running for Wednesday morning.

If anyone is under an understanding different to the above, please call me.

Thanks,

Dave
