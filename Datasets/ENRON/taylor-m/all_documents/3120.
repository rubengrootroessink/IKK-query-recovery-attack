Mark-

Thanks for your quick response. My responses to the points you have raised 
are set forth in red below.

Upon receipt of IBJ's detailed comments, I will forward same for your review.

John-

We have received preliminary comments back from IBJ relating to the draft  
ISDA documentation we recently provided to them.  IBJ appears unwilling to 
enter into a CSA with us.  Please review the traffic below, including Mark's 
comments.  Please provide your view as to how we should proceed on this point.

Best regards, 

John

John - While we can delete Part 6 it then becomes necessary to add additional 
language in each confirmation which is not part of the templates for 
transactions used by the back office.  Each transaction would therefore 
require significant additional time and effort to prepare making it more 
cumbersome to do business with that counterparty.  There is no down-side to 
having the language in the master - the whole point of the master is that we 
agree to these things now so we don't have to deal with them at the confirm 
stage.  You can say "it's enough if the terms are referred to in the 
confirmation" for ALL of the terms of the master.  Since we would insist on 
the appropriate provisions being in the confirm in any event, if they have a 
problem with this language we need to know now what the problem is. I agree 
to all of the preceding points you have raised and really do not understand 
why IBJ would desire to delete these provisions. Once we receive all of their 
specific comments, we will require an explanation as to why these provisions 
are not acceptable.With respect to the CSA, that is an issue for Credit. I 
will forward this to John Suttle for his input.  It is certainly not 
necessary to have a valid agreement but it is necessary if you want to insist 
on collateral.  In this case, if IBJ is a stronger credit than Enron it may 
well be that the csa is more of a burden than a benefit.  Good point.  It 
strikes me as disingenuous to say that they don't have the internal systems 
for csa's with nonfinancial counterparties - the same systems would work for 
nonfinancial parties as well as financial parties.  IBJ is the most 
sophisticated Japanese player in the derivative market and one would believe 
that they could handle the documentation for both financial and non-financial 
entities.  I note, I have heard that it is not market practice for Japanese 
financial institutions to provide collateral to non-financial institutions, 
so it may be very difficult for them to alter their position.

Schedule and not utilizing the CSA.

Thanks,

Dear Mr.Viverito

Thank you very much.
Now we start checking your draft and maybe we can return comment on this
Friday.

Please be advised following points at this time.
1)Part 6 on the schedule is needed to be deleted.
  We think that it's enough if the terms in Part 6 are referred in the
individual confirmation.
2)ISDA Credit support annex is not acceptable
  Unfortunately, we don't have internal system for concluding CSA with
non-financial entity.

Please keep support us for concluding ISDA ASAP for our business in near
future.
If any question, please feel free to contact me.

Best regards,
Konishi /IBJ Tokyo 81-3-3214-1008
