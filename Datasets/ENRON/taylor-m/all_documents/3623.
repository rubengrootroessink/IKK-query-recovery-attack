Mark:

Here is a draft of what I propose Mark Frevert and Mark Haedicke send out to 
the traders re use of third-party electronic trading platforms.  Note that I 
included a contact for questions at the bottom of the policy.  I have listed 
myself for now -- who would you like to designate?  Will this e-mail go out 
to European and other business units as well, and if so, from the same 
senders?

Let me know what you think.

Leslie

Many of you have received offers to use third -party electronic trading 
platforms like Dynegydirect.  Enron has a Policy Relating to Use of Third 
Party Electronic Trading Platforms to serve as a guide to appropriate 
registration for and use of such trading platforms.  The Policy provides that:

You must notify the Enron Net Works LLC (ENW) designee set out in the Policy 
if you receive an offer to trade on such a trading platform and would like to 
take advantage of the offer.
All registration and other documentation must be sent to the ENW designee, 
who will coordinate the necessary legal and administrative review.
You are not authorized to use a third-party electronic trading platform until 
you are authorized by ENW.
The Master User for all third-party electronic trading platform accounts will 
be an ENW designee.
If you are currently using any third-party electronic trading platform, 
please notify the ENW designee.
