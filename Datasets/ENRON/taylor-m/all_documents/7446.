CCH is giving a demo of its new internet service to Enron on Tuesday, 1/16.  
There will be two sessions.  

FERC license is being drafted based on your feedback from last month's free 
trial to include ENA Legal, GPG Legal ( Houston & Omaha), Corp Gov't 
Affairs.  SEC license is being drafted to include Corp Legal, Global Finance 
Legal, and Northern Legal.   I plan to finalize the two license agreements 
after the demo sessions.   You'll also have chance to review other CCH 
internet titles during the demo.   Please join Diane Peters/CCH to learn its 
services.
