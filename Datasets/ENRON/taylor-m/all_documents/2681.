Justin:

Thank you for your message.  Let me know if there is anything I should be 
doing to help you out from this side.     

I have attached the list of countries in which the Pulp and Paper group 
expect to have clients that will be active traders on Clickpaper.com.  I 
believe that EOL has ETAs and Password Applications prepared for these 
jurisdictions, but I'm not sure where we stand on Singapore, South Africa or 
Ireland.  Justin, you probably know where we are with Ireland, -- Alan or 
Mark -- any idea on where we may stand in South Africa or Singapore?

Justin, I would assume that the form of ETA that EOL currently uses for a 
particular jurisdiction could be revised to reflect  Clickpaper as the 
counterparty, but I noticed that EOL's form of ETA is with a UK entity.  
Should Clickpaper adopt the same structure for trading in Europe?

Travis 

Attached is the preliminary list of the European counterparties.  As of now 
the countries to work on for the ETC and Password Application are:

Austria
Belgium
Finland
France
Ireland
Italy
Netherlands
Portugal
Sinagapore
South Africa
Spain
Sweden
United Kingdom

The only ones not on the EOL list are Ireland, Singapore and South Africa.  
Let me know what is required to Clickpaperize the EOL stuff and also what do 
we do about GTC physical and financial (ie are these country specific too).
