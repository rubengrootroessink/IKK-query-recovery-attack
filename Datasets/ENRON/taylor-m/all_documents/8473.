The changes, except for the scheduling changes, have been included in the 
proposed final version of this East Power Physical Spread product and as 
requested confirm that I currently have no further issues with this product. 

The quicker we can get the scheduling language added the better, especially 
from the trader's perspective.
 
Regards,
 
Marcus
