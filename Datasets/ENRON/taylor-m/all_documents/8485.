Hello Xdrive User,

In the past you signed up for a free, advertising-based Xdrive Express
online storage account at http://www.xdrive.com/. We appreciate your
past use of Xdrive, an Online Storage Box for Everyone(tm). Our privacy
policy http://www.xdrive.com/company/privacy_popup.html permits us to
contact you about the service, so I'm writing to you today about the
closure of the free Xdrive Express service and to invite you to try the
new subscription-based, advertising-free Xdrive Plus service at:
http://plus.xdrive.com/. If you have received this message because of
a mistake, I apologize. And to unsubscribe from future Xdrive messages,
please simply click on this link:

I'm writing because the Xdrive Express service was permanently closed
on May 15, 2001, after notifying users as described on this page
http://www.xdrive.com/index_express.html .  According to our records
you didn't access your free Xdrive Express account for 120 days or more
before the service was closed, so I'd like to suggest our high-quality
Xdrive Plus service as a replacement for you to evaluate.  (Please note
that files stored on the free Xdrive Express service are no longer
accessible nor recoverable.)  Being subscription-based, Xdrive Plus is
a significant upgrade in service and has all the features you once
enjoyed in Xdrive Express plus many more.

As a managed alternative to your old Xdrive Express account, I would
like to encourage you to try the advanced Xdrive Plus service FREE for
15 days.  Sign up for it at http://plus.xdrive.com/signup.html . After
the first 15 days, the Plus service can be continued for a very
reasonable fee, considering all the professional-grade power it
provides...

With the new Xdrive Plus service, your data is still safe, backed up
and accessible from any Web-enabled laptop or PC.  Increase your
productivity by managing files and collaborating with co-workers across
town or around the globe.  Upload, download or transfer business
documents, presentations, graphics or even your personal audio/video
files without having to remember what computer you created them on.
Xdrive Plus is compatible with any file format - providing the perfect
storage solution for busy professionals like you who need anytime,
anywhere access to all their digital information.

Your Xdrive Plus subscription will include:
* Secure and accessible file storage from anywhere via any Web-enabled
  Laptop or PC
* Convenient storage and sharing tools for all your digital files -
  including business documents, PowerPoint(TM) files, MP3s, family
  photos and more
* Flexible service options to let you buy more space as you need it
* Peer-to-peer folder sharing and universal (public) file sharing.
  Drag and drop to Xdrive Plus as you would any highly-secure,
  highly-accessible, completely backed up local hard drive.

I'd like to invite you to join thousands of professionals and try
Xdrive Plus FREE for 15 days.  For more information about Xdrive Plus
or to SUBSCRIBE, visit http://plus.xdrive.com/.  And write me with your
ideas about what you'd like to see in future versions of Xdrive Plus at
mailto:plus.feedback@xdrive.com .

And if you are a business user of online storage, I'd like to recommend
InternetConnect's Managed Storage solution
(http://www.internetconnect.net/managedstorage/), which is powered by
Xdrive's technology.  See below for details on this exciting new
service.

Best regards,
