Scott - I have a few more relevant facts for you: 

1. Peter Quine's letterhead (re: letter received by V&E 11 Aug 2000) shows an 
apparent company name of 'e-nvironmental trading'.  Yet, interestingly, the 
squatted enronmetals.com website has references per Fig. 1 below to:

 - 'WE ARE ENVIRONMETALS' - appears upon mouse-over of the faux logo ' 
ENviRONMEnTALS.COM'
 - 'Manufactured Metal Miscellany' 

If Mr. Quine were acting in good faith, I believe he should have a good 
explanation for the what the connection might be between 'environmentals 
trading' and 'manufactured metals miscellany'.   Is he concerned with 
environmentals or environmetals ?  (Please See Figure 3 and comments below to 
see the rather dubious connection between the two.)

Fig. 1 - www.enronmetals.com - homepage



Figure 2 - 'Contact Us' page

- This is misleading/misrepresentative since users would be led to believe 
that they may be contacting Enron Metals (vs. e-nvironmental trading) when 
they are invited to send email to :   'anyquestions@enronmetals.com'


Figure 3 - 'About Us' page

- contains text: 
'We are a Brighton based group whose aim is to bring together
makers-suppliers-collectors
of environmentally-friendly
metals objets'





In addition, I checked on the register.com site and found that the website:  
www.environmetals.com  has NOT been registered to anyone and is still 
available for purchase.  I would argue that if Peter Quine were acting in 
good faith, he would have already purchased this name .

Also, can you contact EasySpace, the host/ISP for both enronmetals.com and 
enronmetals.co.uk to instruct them that the names are in dispute so we can 
have the .com site suspended?  The enronmetals.co.uk site simply calls up a 
'holding page' at the moment:




EasySpace can be reached at:

Technical Contact, Registrar:
   "Mr Easyspace Hostmaster" <hostmaster@easyspace.com>
   Phone: http://www.easyspace.com/   Fax:   +44 1932 350 222

(For the .co.uk  name, I believe Nominet (http://www.nominet.org.uk/) will 
have to authorize the ownership transfer, whereas for the .com name, 
EasySpace should be able to handle the transfer).  

Hope this helps.
-Paul

Timeline with Relevant Facts/Events:

18 May '00 - Enron announces acquisition of MG plc  (soon to be renamed Enron 
Metals Limited)
18 Jun '00 - Peter Quine purchases two domain names: EnronMetals.com  and 
EnronMetals.co.uk

<<correspondence among parties - Enron ext. legal counsel, Scott Brown of 
Vinson & Elkins LLP, and Mr. Peter Quine -  >>

21 Jul ' 00 - Letter from Vinson & Elkins sent to Peter Quine 
 7 Aug' 00 - Letter sent by Peter Quine to Vinson & Elkins (letter received 
11 Aug '00)
22 Aug '00 - Email from Scott Brown to Peter Quine
???

The documents corresponding to the above dates were already forwarded to you 
by Justin Boyd.  Further relevant facts may be forthcoming from Felipe Foy of 
our IT team, but I believe you now have more than sufficient factual 
information to proceed with this. 

I also strongly suggest that the ISPs hosting these sites are immediately 
notified of pending arbitration in both the US and UK so that the 2 websites 
will be suspended from operation immediately.  I believe in the US (and 
v.likkely the UK) that the hosting ISP must by law suspend any websites until 
the domain name dispute resolution process has been carried out, though I may 
be mistaken.
