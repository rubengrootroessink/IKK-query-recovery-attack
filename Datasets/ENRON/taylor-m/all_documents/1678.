Some time ago (it may be several years) you asked me how to increase HDL
with diet.  I didn't know the answer.  Yesterday while reading a magazine
I came upon the following short article and thought of you:

 "Drinking three 8-ounce glasses of orange juice per day may be
heart-healthy.   Flavonoids in the juice increase the amount of
high-density lipoproteins (HDL),  or "good" cholesterol, in the blood,
and lower low-density lipoproteins (LDL), or "bad" cholesterol."

That's a lot of juice!

Tim and Sharon are leaving tomorrow afternoon for Russia.  Their court
date is Thursday.  They will return April 15.

Thursday Dad and I ordered some new furniture for the study--a desk, two
lateral file cabinets, and some bookcases.  The desk is mostly top--a
corner unit for the computer and additional space on one side for Dad and
the other side for me.  There is a rolling cabinet of drawers that fits
under the top anywhere we want to put it.  This is inexpensive stuff that
comes "all assembly required."  I ordered it delivered and assembled as a
gift for Dad for Father's Day.  Yesterday we finished going through all
the books and files, throwing out quite a few, and moving those that are
left into the guest room.  Now we need to spackle all the holes left by
pictures and those wall standards which held our bookshelves.  Then the
room needs to be painted and the carpet cleaned.  If our sorting job is
any indication, it will be summer before we are finished!  It is a good
thing there is no deadline.

The day after we ordered the furniture we discovered that there is a leak
in one of our bathrooms.  There is no water on the floor in the bathrooms
but  water is dripping through the ceiling in the garage.  Goodness only
knows where the leak is located.  The ceiling of the garage is plastered!
 Fixing that problem may run into more money than the furniture!  It
should be a long, long time before you run into such problems in your
house since it is comparatively new.  Be thankful!

I guess by now you have been to Amsterdam and back.  Did you get to the
Van Gogh Museum?  Isn't it incredible?

Love, Mother
