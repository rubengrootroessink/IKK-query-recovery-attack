Subject: Hedging Regulations Comment Letter

Attached is a revised draft, redlined to show changes made in response
to
helpful comments received from Robert's colleague and to reflect the
discussion at last week's meeting of the Tax Committee.  I will review
the
draft one more time to check citations, etc. and we need to get the
three
exhibits (one from the ISDA office on dealer-members and the other two
illustrating weather and energy derivatives transactions).  I would of
course welcome any additional comments you may have.

In terms of scheduling, as Ruth knows, I will be out of the country the
week
of April 9, but will be here this week and then back in the office on
Monday
April 16.  I will double check, but I think April 23 is the last day for
filing comments with the IRS and requesting an opportunity to testify at
hearings.

Don
