I saw a story on Enron's 4Q results and subsequent stock gain yesterday.
All I could think about was Ted once again taking the opportunity to bug you
about buying a new car.  I'm guessing the jump in your stock price yesterday
makes that convertible Jag look a lot better.

I guess you're in Key West right now...wow, in the Keys and working for a
company who's stock is going up...I'm jealous.

Have a good time.

Hey Jim,

Thanks for the note.  Nothing much new to report here.  Ted was in South
Beach last weekend but came home a day early to work.  He's still trying to
talk me into buying a new car which I would like to do but can't figure out
what I really want.  I'm speaking at a conference in Key West next week and
will stay through the weekend - I think it's the only place left on the
continent that's warm.  Nothing like Zurich here but it's been in the 40's
and rainy - seems like forever since I've been fully warm through.

Let us know when you find a place to live

Mark
