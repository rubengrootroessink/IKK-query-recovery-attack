Sounds like they are getting desperate....must be if they are sending me 
emails. I have told Marcelo that you are dealing with this and will revert to 
Al.

Dear Marcus,

I have been asked by Al Pennisi for help on obtaining approval on sending out 
formal notification to the regulatory bodies on the ownership and name change 
of Enron Trading Service Inc.  Please also note that he needs to state that 
the financial condition of the company has not been altered.

Al tells me that he is under pressure to get this out ASAP.  If at all 
possible could you assist us with this request.

Thank you for your help.

Best regards,
Marcelo
