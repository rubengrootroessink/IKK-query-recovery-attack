A legal memorandum on Internet commodities trading was prepared by outside 
counsel on November 8, 1999.  Metals trading was not specifically covered in 
the questionaire we sent.  I am attaching a copy of the memo.  If you want, I 
will be glad to contact local counsel with follow up questions relating to 
metals.  Please let me know what the relevant circumstances are for Mexico so 
I can ask the appropriate questions.  Justin, would you like to be involved 
in any conference calls we set up?
Regards,
Brent

Justin has never dealt with a Mexican company for Enrononline therefore could 
you please give us  some advice on due dilligence done in Mexico. Justin 
needs to review this client for metals.  Thank you.
