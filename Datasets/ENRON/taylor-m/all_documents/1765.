Sorry, they are not home yet.  I haven't had any more news since those
messages I sent to you last week.  They were waiting in Perm for 10 days
after the first court date, which was 3/31, before they get the final
papers.  I think that is probably today.  Then they must go to Moscow to
get her visa.  They are scheduled to get home this coming Saturday.

By the way, thank  you for sending me the address of the article about
Enron.  It was an easily understood description of the company.  The
links I use on Yahoo and Quicken don't send me to articles like that.

Love, Mother
