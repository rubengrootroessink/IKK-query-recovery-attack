I spoke with the Hotel in St Thomas - all systems go for now - they seemed
totally unfazed by the entire thing.  They have the reservation and no
problem.

The Airline has cancelled all flights from San Juan to St Thomas for today.
They did not have an outlook at this time for tomorrow.  They suggested we
check in as early as possible tomorrow so that we keep our confirmed seat
assignment from San Juan to St Thomas in case there are a lot of stranded
people trying to get there as well.

Does anyone have a projection on the storm's movement by tomorrow morning?
I feel really dumb - I don't even know which island on the map St Thomas is.
(see the attached pictures)

If the flight from San Juan to St Thomas is cancelled, we will be stranded
there and have to take a flight out at a later time and need to get a hotel
in San Juan.  I have not yet asked them to change our departure date as a
pre-caution - that is next, but I think that causes problems with the air
fare.

Here are some pictures I found on CNN.com.
