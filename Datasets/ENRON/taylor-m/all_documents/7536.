Here is the new EGM Linking Agreement.  I have also attached a redline to
show the differences between it and the last draft of the EOL linking
agreement.

I will send the revised Master Agreement in a separate email.

Please call when you have reviewed, and I will finalize and send to a
broader distribution.

Best Regards,

Ted
