Attached please find a brief memo that I have prepared outlining my proposed 
changes (or at least changes for consideration) when we decide to revise the 
EnronOnline Electronic Trading Agreement.  I wanted to make sure that you had 
my comments before I go on leave in case the ETA is updated while I'm out.  
Please feel free to revise or supplement as appropriate.

Leslie
