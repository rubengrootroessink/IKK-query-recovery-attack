Dear members legal group WG standardisation & members WG Standardisation,

When investigating what could be the best route for EFET to come to a
Financial Standard Contract for energy trading companies in Europe, I came
across the excellent work done by the Nordic countries. Please found
information I received from Martin Rosell, who was so cooperative to give me
the ok to send it to you.

I would like to get your advice on the following questions:
-1-    is the proposed financial energy master agreement the best basis for
a Financial Standard Contract.
        instead of e.g. ISDA

-2-    is FEMA good enough that EFET could endors the present version and
promote the present version
        (and avoid re inventing the wheel)
-3-    what do you advise EFET to do?

Please let me know, before 20th March, your remarks and suggestions.

FYI,  on April 6th the Nordic countries want to vote on the FEMA contract,
after receipt of the legal opinions.

Best regards,
EFET
Jan van Aken
