Timeline with Relevant Facts/Events:

18 May '00 - Enron announces acquisition of MG plc  (soon to be renamed Enron 
Metals Limited)
18 Jun '00 - Peter Quine purchases two domain names: EnronMetals.com  and 
EnronMetals.co.uk

<<correspondence among parties - Enron ext. legal counsel, Scott Brown of 
Vinson & Elkins LLP, and Mr. Peter Quine -  >>

21 Jul ' 00 - Letter from Vinson & Elkins sent to Peter Quine 
 7 Aug' 00 - Letter sent by Peter Quine to Vinson & Elkins (letter received 
11 Aug '00)
22 Aug '00 - Email from Scott Brown to Peter Quine
???

The documents corresponding to the above dates were already forwarded to you 
by Justin Boyd.  Further relevant facts may be forthcoming from Felipe Foy of 
our IT team, but I believe you now have more than sufficient factual 
information to proceed with this. 

I also strongly suggest that the ISPs hosting these sites are immediately 
notified of pending arbitration in both the US and UK so that the 2 websites 
will be suspended from operation immediately.  I believe in the US (and 
v.likkely the UK) that the hosting ISP must by law suspend any websites until 
the domain name dispute resolution process has been carried out, though I may 
be mistaken.
