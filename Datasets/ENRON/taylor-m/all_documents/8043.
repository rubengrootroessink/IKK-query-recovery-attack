Site Unseen

A Source for Web Law

By Deirdre Lanning; http://www.ecompany.com/siteunseen

Keeping up to speed on the latest Internet copyright infringement
laws or antitrust developments can be difficult these days. For a
dose of legal information focused on the Internet and technology,
check out http://www.GigaLaw.com. The site is run by lawyers, most
of whom have a background in or practice intellectual property and
Internet law.

Along with frequent updates on ongoing fiascoes like Microsoft's
antitrust case and Napster's present copyright ordeal, the site
includes daily articles dealing with all aspects of Internet law.
From the homepage you can sign up for one of GigaLaw's free
newsletters or jump to its great law library. You can also voice
your opinion on questions like "Should the FBI be allowed to search
e-mail with its new Carnivore program?" by voting at the site's
frequent polls. And if you've found yourself on the opposite side
of the tracks and actually need a lawyer, keep an eye out for
GigaLaw's soon-to-be-available directory of technology lawyers.

For more information on technology and Internet-related law
information, try Jeffrey Kuester's http://www.KuesterLaw.com,
which includes links to some relevant government offices and the
text of actual cases, or http://www.FindLaw.com, for a
comprehensive, Yahoo-like Web directory of law.
