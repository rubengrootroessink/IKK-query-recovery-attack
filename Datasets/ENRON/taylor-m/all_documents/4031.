Notice No. 00-421
December 12, 2000

MEMORANDUM

TO:  ALL NYMEX AND COMEX MEMBERS

FROM:  Neal L. Wolkoff
  Executive Vice President

DATE:  December 12, 2000

RE:  Reminder of Price Fluctuation Limits Applicable to Trading on NYMEX=20
ACCESS&#61495;

The purpose of this Notice is to remind Members and Member Firms that an=20
Executive Committee Resolution that was ratified by the Board of Directors=
=20
and that concerns Exchange price fluctuation limit rules as those rules app=
ly=20
to trading on NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; (Resolution), remains in effect and will=
=20
continue until February 1, 2001, unless Members are notified otherwise by t=
he=20
Exchange.

As background, on October 6, 2000, the Exchange issued a Notice to Members=
=20
(#347), advising Members and Member Firms that the CFTC had approved this=
=20
Resolution.  The Resolution, which became effective with the commencement o=
f=20
the NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; session on Sunday, October 8, 2000, has amended on=
 a=20
temporary basis a number of Exchange price fluctuation limit rules as those=
=20
rules apply to trading on NYMEX ACCESS&#61495;. The Resolution is included=
=20
below.

The Resolution was issued so as to ensure the successful reimplementation o=
f=20
the new implied order functionality on NYMEX ACCESS&#61495;.  By=20
significantly expanding the price fluctuation limits applicable to trading=
=20
activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESS&#61495;, the Resolution reduces the=20
possibility that a price limit would be triggered by the implied=20
functionality.

The Resolution amends, on a temporary basis, Exchange price fluctuation lim=
it=20
rules - but only with respect to market activity occurring on NYMEX=20
ACCESS&#61495;.

Thus, the new price limits that went into effect last week for Natural Gas=
=20
are further expanded as provided by the terms of the Resolution.

The Resolution amends the Exchange=01,s price fluctuation limit rules with=
=20
regard to trading on NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; in four ways:

(1) The initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits (for each Exchange=
=20
futures contract that has such limits) are expanded to 200% of the initial=
=20
and subsequent price fluctuation limits applicable to the first two contrac=
t=20
months for energy contracts, or to the first contract month with limits in=
=20
effect for metals contracts, of that futures contract under the applicable=
=20
rule.

(2) This expanded limit (e.g., 200% of the limits for the front two months=
=20
for energy contracts) is applicable to all contract months for that futures=
=20
contract.

(3) In the event that an expanded price limit was touched by a bid or offer=
,=20
trading on NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; generally would be halted immediately, rath=
er=20
than requiring the market to trade at that price for five minutes. During t=
he=20
last 90 minutes of a NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; session, the market would be halt=
ed=20
only far as long as it takes for the system to incorporate expanded price=
=20
limits.

(4) As a clarification, the Resolution suspends use of certain =01&haircuts=
=018=20
narrowing price limits based on notional settlement prices.  Specifically,=
=20
NYMEX Rule 6.56 (Settlement Prices and Price Fluctuation Limits for NYMEX=
=20
ACCESS&#61495;) establishes the use of notional settlement prices as the ba=
se=20
point for price limits (until the actual settlement prices from the RTH=20
session can be input into the system.)  NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; will continue =
to=20
use such notional settlement prices under the Resolution.  However, Rule 6.=
56=20
reduces applicable price limits by certain specified percentages during the=
=20
period when notional settlement prices are used as the base point for=20
establishing limits. Such =01&haircuts=018 are not being used under the Res=
olution;=20
the Exchange will resume use of such haircuts following the expiration of t=
he=20
Resolution.

Finally, the Resolution also clarifies one aspect of existing Exchange=20
practice.  In the event that a contract trading on NYMEX ACCESS&#61495;=20
traded for five minutes at a price fluctuation limit applicable to Regular=
=20
Trading Hours (RTH) trading, then the RTH session would open with expanded=
=20
price fluctuation limits as provided under the applicable rule.  This=20
practice will continue to be followed during the period when the Resolution=
=20
is in effect, even though there had been no temporary cessation of trading=
=20
during the NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; trading session because the market had not=
=20
hit the expanded limits applicable only to NYMEX ACCESS&#61495;.


*  * * *
As noted, these temporary amendments to the Exchange=01,s price limits shal=
l=20
expire on February 1, 2001, unless Members are notified otherwise by the=20
Exchange.

The Executive Committee of the Board of Directors hereby

Resolves that, until further notice, the price fluctuation limit rules for=

=20
applicable rule.

This expanded limit (200% of the limits for the first two months with limit=
s)=20
shall be applicable to all contract months for that futures contract.

In the event that such a price fluctuation limit is reached by a bona fide=
=20
bid at the high price fluctuation limit or a bona fide offer at the low pri=
ce=20
fluctuation limit, trading on NYMEX ACCESSc shall be halted immediately=20
except as directed otherwise by the President or the President=01,s designe=
e. =20

f=20
the limits applicable to RTH trading.  In the event that a limit is touched=
=20
during the last 90 minutes of a NYMEX ACCESSc session, the market shall be=
=20
halted briefly, and price limits shall be expanded thereafter

In addition, in the event that a contract trading on NYMEX ACCESSc traded f=
or=20
five minutes during the NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; session at a price fluctuation=
=20
limit applicable to the Regular Trading Hours session, then the RTH session=

applicable rule, even though no temporary cessation of trading occurred=20
during the NYMEX ACCESSc trading session.
