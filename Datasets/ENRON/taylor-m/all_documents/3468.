Mark,

Can you please start putting together documentation for the following?

- Pipeline Capacity Trading ETA (to appear on the new capacity trading 
website)
- Pipeline Capacity Trading Service Contract (entered into on paper with 
piplelines wishing to post their capacity on EnronOnline

I imagine the ETA will be modeled pretty closely on the existing ETA.

For the Service Contract, I assume we will be covering things like:

- Nature of the Service (what we will do and what they will do)
 - They will
  -Post products on EnronOnline
  - Take responsibility for their prices
  - Be bound by any transactions which result, subject to their Tariff 
schedules.
  - Pay for any hardware needed at their end and/or any 3rd party connection 
costs (e.g. internet service providers)
 - We will
  - Provide the software
  - Host and maintain the database
  - Facilitate access to the application
  - Administer User ID's
  - Provide support for Product creation
- Representation, warranties and limitations of our liability for the service
- Confidentiality

I assume we may need to sit down and discuss in more detail. I will forward 
the latest copy of our functional spec.  Please call and let me know what I 
can do to help in putting the above together.

Thanks,

Dave
