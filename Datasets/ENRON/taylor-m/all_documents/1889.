Finally, the electronic approval system is close at hand. The original 
intention was to manage it within Livelink. However, this platform does not 
seem to provide a workflow that is smooth and user friendly enough, and 
consequently we may go for a Word document only instead. (Under this latter 
arrangement, we would place a template on a shared drive that all concerned 
parties could access.)

Whether we go for Livelink or a Word document only, we will need to create a 
template with information about the reference entity. My initial thought is 
that we would have three main fields: One information field about the entity, 
one field for Credit an one field for Legal. The suggested information to 
input would be the following:

Information field about the entity: Name; Name of ultimate parent; Country of 
incorporation and operation; Name of originator making the request; Date of 
request; Comments field.

Credit: Approval/Rejection tick box, Comments field; Credit ratings (public 
and Enron); Tenor and mark-to-market limits; Name of person handling the 
request.

Legal: Approval/Rejection tick box, Comments field; Name of person handling 
the request.

Could you please let me know you need if you feel that the provided 
information is sufficient and let me have your comments.

Also, I understand that Debbie, Bill and Rod handle the Credit approval. 
(Please confirm!) However, Mark you are the only one from Legal. Could you 
please be kind and forward me the names of some of your colleagues that could 
handle the approvals should you be absent. (Do European reference credits get 
approved by London or Houston credit?)

Many thanks

Tomas
