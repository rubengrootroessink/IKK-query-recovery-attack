Mark --

Rick Shapiro has asked that I coordinate with you on CFTC issues since I'll 
be handling government affairs matters for Enron Global Markets and Enron 
Networks.    

Would it be possible to meet sometime this week (or early next week) to talk 
about this?   I will be in Houston on Thursday and Friday of this week, and 
all of next week.   Let me know what works for you.

Looking forward to meeting you.

Lisa
