IT informed me that they should be able to provide "outside" access to the 
Customer website by Tuesday.  As such I will hold of sending you any hard 
copies of the webpages.  I will let you know when the site is open.

Thanks,
Mike

Yes, I think they could develop some initial thoughts with that kind of 
description.

It sounds like it may be a little while before the IT group gets the final 
approval to move the web site to the outside.  In the mean time, is it worth 
while to send Sullivan&Cromwell print outs of the pages?  Right now there is 
not really much info on the site.  We can identify third party links, the 
type of information we will be providing as well as sources for our data.  
Will this be of use?

I have been able to access this but our outside legal counsel (Sullivan & 
Cromwell in NY) can't.  Any way for them to get access so they can advise us 
on this?  They are also the guys who will help with a training session on 
various legal issues and company policies in trading.

Mark,

As discussed, here is the URL for the proposed web site:   
http://ecthou-lndev1.nt.ect.enron.com/westpowernet.nsf/
It is still on an internal server which I hope you will have access to.  Let 
me know if it doesn't work.  

The User ID is: "user1"  and the Password is:  "test"  .

I also ran through several of the web sites from which we gather our 
information and did not run across the occurance of any copyright statements.

In terms of timing, we hope to release the site by the end of January to a 
limited customer listing.

Regards,
Mike Etringer
