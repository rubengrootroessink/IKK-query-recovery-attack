Hi Mark -

The Legal Group in London (Justin Boyd) has advised that office that it would 
be OK to stop sending GTC's with confirms.  Instead, the documentation teams 
in London have been advised to include the following language on their 
EnronOnline transactions that are governed under GTC's (not governed by 
Master Agreements):

"This Transaction is governed by the EnronOnline General Terms and Conditions 
(GTC) that you have accepted via EnronOnline. For a copy of this GTC, please 
click on the Product Description on the EnronOnline website and choose "View 
GTC".

Please advise if this policy may be applied to the EnronOnline transactions 
for the Houston office. 

Thanks -
Rob
