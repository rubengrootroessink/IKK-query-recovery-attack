The Downtown Optimists Club was founded in 1924 by a number of prominent 
Houstonians such as Emanuel Olshan of Olshan Lumber Company, Judge Roy 
Hofheinz, humorist Morris Frank whom the Morris Frank Library is named after 
and Phil Rich of the Phil Rich Fan Company whose Windmaker Fans cooled 
Houston Public School students until the introduction of air conditioning. 
This makes the Downtown Optimist Club of Houston the oldest Optimist Club in 
Texas. In 1947 the Downtown Optimists founded the Boy's and Girl's Harbor in 
LaPorte, Texas at the old Ross Sterling Mansion. The Harbor currently houses 
over 65 children without any government funding..
