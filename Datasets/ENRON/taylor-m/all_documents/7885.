Carol, attached is the Canadian industrial on which I have worked, both clean 
and redlined from the US industrial (the redlined annexes are somewhat 
laborious).  Please note in the area of transaction formation that Canada 
desired confirmation with and without phone (wherein confirmation is prepared 
and signed with counterparty "at the table" so to speak).  Please review and 
provide me your comments.  Thanks for your help.

Mark, in terms of processes, should I distribute this to anyone else for 
review and comment?

  


Cordially,
