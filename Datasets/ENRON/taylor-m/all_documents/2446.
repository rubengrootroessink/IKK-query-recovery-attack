According to legal, we have no jurisdiction over the domain name or its use.  

Therefore we have no reason to become involved ( notify either party etc).

Obviously we would not pursue any activity similar to this.

The spectrononline problem. 

From initial IT investigation, it appears the domain name is owned by a 
trader at Alliance Gas.  We have had no knowledge of this until one of our 
power traders 
found out yesterday.
Please could you advise if we need to do anything (eg notify Spectron , 
contact the IT resource we located on the web.

Thanks

Louise

excellent ruse!  We heard about this through other brokers who heard it from 
a counterparty.  However I tried the same for ICAPonline and 
intercapitalonline after Derek joked with them that we'd done it for all the 
other brokers, and they had no sites.  I wonder if they'll reserve the sites 
for themselves now that their minds have been focused, if you were thinking 
of doing the same for other brokers names, we should get moving.

Hope Houston's treating you well,

Louis
