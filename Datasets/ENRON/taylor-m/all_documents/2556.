As we discussed, the following is proposed disclosure language regarding 
direct access:

EnronOnline will provide users, upon request, with "T1" lines or other means 
of direct access to EnronOnline, as an alternative to internet access, 
provided that the users will be responsible for all costs associated with the 
establishment of direct access.  Direct access connections might enable users 
to access EnronOnline more quickly than is currently possible through 
internet access.

In terms of placement, I think this disclosure could initially be included on 
the "ticker", as we discussed.  However, once users begin to establish direct 
connections, it should probably be included as well in the "Legal and 
Privacy" notices or in the ETA.  We should discuss after you have had a 
chance to consider the language.  Thanks.
