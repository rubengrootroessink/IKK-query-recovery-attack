Sara- this looks OK with me..

The major difference between this draft and the last is that instead of Enron 
monitoring the credit line, Global will... Global will be able to deal with 
Enron if the credit line with Cargill has not been breached or if they have 
gotten prior approval from Cargill to breach the line.

If Global trades with Enron without Cargill consent, Cargill will notify 
Enron and Global that the trade is not valid and Global will have to unwind 
the trade at current market rates..  

Please let me know if you have any problems with this.

Kind Regards,
Caroline
