Responding to popular demand, I prepared a PowerPoint to serve as a backdrop
for the interactive portion of the panel discussion.  (Attached is the
simple version.  Nothing moves or sings.)  I thought we would go through the
various trading facilities, from most to least exempt and get your views, in
your capacity as a representative of one of the interested parties, of the
advantages and disadvantages of each form of organization.  Richard Miller's
ideas regarding bankruptcy issues should be worked in at each of these
levels.  I think we can dismiss the Treasury Amendment Exchange without any
discussion, but the rest are each worth a few minutes.  I would like to
leave at least an hour for this part of the discussion.

I know I made many mistakes in characterizing the requirements for each of
the different trading facilities and will appreciate all constructive
suggestions.  If you think any other main topic ought to be added to the
grid, please let me know.

Jane, will we be able to get a projector in the room?  Should I bring my own
computer?
