Hi Mark, 

Things have gone well this week.  I was able to et most of the 
personnel/administrative stuff out of the way.  (Thanx Keegan!).     Also, I 
located lots of background reading on everything I ever wanted to know about 
the swaps market and how we fit in.  With Tana"s help, I also watched the 
"deal tape" which I found both amusing and informative.
 
I will be out of the office for most of this afternoon.   My recruiter is 
available this afternoon to take me around to secure a permanent apartment 
closer to work -- in the Montrose or River Oaks area.   I  quickly decided 
that commuting from the burbs is not for me.  (You can take me out of 
Manhattan but can't take the Manhattan out of me).
