Rahil & Mark

Here's the item that I'm concerned about.  Perhaps my ignorance is making me 
over-zealous, but this concerns me.


Thanks

Jay

Jay,

The EnronOnline team gets those numbers from the weekly Newsletter 
distributed the ENA Commercial Team.   Ross Prevatt is the individual who
actually puts the information together.

In talking with Ross this morning, that information is taken from a Telerate 
feed  (the Telerate feeder gets the info from daily/weekly/monthly 
publications).  Ross did not give me the specific companies that publish the 
information.  Feel free to call Ross directly if you need additional 
information.

Thanks,

dg

Dear Donna

(Following the voicemail that I left for you on Friday)  I was wondering if 
you could tell me whether or not the US Gas Storage data & the cumulative 
CDD/HDD data are taken from inside Enron only?  (I'm asking because Paul 
Goddard has encouraged me to update our letters of consent for content that 
we carry on the website.)

Many thanks,

Jay
