Peter,  I have a 1986 Newport 28 and have tried tung oil, lemon oil and
finally Liquid Gold, which gave me the best long term results by far. The
lemon and tung oil looked good for a few weeks, but quickly dulled. Someone
on the Cruising World board suggested Liquid Gold as the longest lasting. It
has been on my interior since August and still looks great. No mildew
anymore either, which can be a challenge here in Florida. Someone else may
have a better option, but so far I am really happy with the results.
