Mark: Just to let you know that we already engaged Pinheiro Neto to assist us 
with the Enron On Line project. They promised to prepare the preliminary 
memorandum in 5 business days after receiving the questionnaire. Please let 
me know when you plan to send us the material and whether I can do anything 
to help. Thanks much.
