Sorry - I did not understand that Enron Credit.com employees were executing 
contracts in Houston.  I have no objections to their signing contracts that 
are governed by Texas law, but they should not be physically signing 
contracts outside the UK.  We have discussed these issues with them and they 
understand that they can sign anything while they are in the UK but they can 
never act for ENA and ENA employees cannot act for Enron Credit.com and that 
employees of both companies should not conclude contracts outside their home 
jurisdictions.  Please let me know if this creates problems and we will 
devise a way to accomplish your objectives.
