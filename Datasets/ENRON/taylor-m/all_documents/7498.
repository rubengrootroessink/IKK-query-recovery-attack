Marie -
I have reviewed the changes you have requested for the US Bandwidth 
products.  Please be advised that the process of revising the product types 
and variables comprising the products will be substantial.  

7 Bandwidth product type descriptions will need to be rewritten (1 product 
name has been changed).
The reference period description will need to be revised.
68 Bandwidth locations will need to be revised.
Note:  Although Legal has requested a change, "Currency" CANNOT be revised.
The Unit of Measurement description has been revised and in addition also 
includes refererence to a "Service Level Agreement."
  
In order to apprise the EOL team of the changes, please note that Legal has 
revised the Bandwidth GTC's and requested changes to the following 7 product 
descriptions:

US Bandwidth DS-3 Phy Fwd
US Bandwidth OC-12c Phy Fwd
US Bandwidth OC-48c Phy Fwd
US Bandwidth OC-3 Phy Fwd
US Bandwidth OC-3c Phy Fwd
US Bandwidth STM-1 Phy Fwd
In addition, Legal has revised the product description:
US Bandwidth DW-48 Phy Fwd has been changed to US Bandwidth 2.5G Naval Phy Fwd

(Marie, please note that the Premium and Standard Service IP products will 
not be revised since their descriptions were created for a one-time 
demonstration).

For EOL purposes, please note that the product types should include the 
reference to the transaction as being "A US Transaction."  You have requested 
the following changes:

e.g.:  Product Type (for DS-3 to be revised from):

"A US Bandwidth Transaction with Enron Broadband Services, L.P. ("EBS") 
pursuant to which the Seller shall sell and the Buyer shall buy the quantity 
of Bandwidth Units submitted by Counterparty via the Website. The number of 
DSO's per DS3 is 672. The price shall be as submitted by the Counterparty via 
the Website. Any party entering into a Transaction to buy or sell Bandwidth 
Units from or to EBS shall be responsible for connecting to the Demarcation 
Point located at each Market Pooling Point in order to take physical delivery 
of such Bandwidth.  In order to achieve such connectivity, a party may incur 
costs and expenses and may additionally be required to execute certain 
documentation."
 
to (note: insert "US"):

"A US Transaction with Enron Broadband Services, L.P. ("Company") for the 
purchase and sale of Bandwidth pursuant to which Seller shall sell and  Buyer 
shall buy the number of units of Bandwidth ("Bandwidth Units") submitted by 
Counterparty via the Website. The number of DS-0s per DS-3 is 672. The price 
shall be as submitted by the Counterparty via the Website. Any Party entering 
into a Transaction to buy or sell Bandwidth Units from or to Company shall be 
responsible for connecting to each applicable Demarcation Point in order to 
take or make, as applicable, physical delivery of such Bandwidth Units.  In 
order to achieve such connectivity, a Party may incur costs and expenses and 
may additionally be required to execute certain documentation."

Reference Period to be revised from:

"The Term of the Transaction shall begin at 12:00 a.m. (EST) on the Effective 
Date and continue to 11:59: 59 p.m. (EST) on the Termination Date. The 
Effective Date is 01 Apr 2001 and the Termination Date is 30 Sep 2001."

to:

e.g. "The Transaction shall commence at 12:00 a.m. (EST) on 01 Nov 2000 and 
continue until 11:50:59 p.m. (EST) on 30 Apr 2001."

Location to be revised from (e.g. New York to LA):

"The Transaction shall be for Bandwidth between the New York Market Pooling 
Point (111 8th Avenue, Suite 1517, New York, NY 10011, NPA-NXX: 212-462, 
CLLI: NYCMNY83H62) and the Los Angeles Market Pooling Point (530 W. 6th 
Street, Suite 300, Los Angeles, CA 90014, NPA-NXX: 213-362, CLLI: 
LSAJCAWZH04),  for a total of 2,446 DSO miles."  

to:

"The Transaction shall be for Bandwidth Units between: (a) 111 8th Avenue, 
Suite 1517, New York, NY 10011, NPA-NXX: 212-462, CLLI: NYCMNY83H62 and (b) 
530 W. 6th Street, Suite 300, Los Angeles, CA 90014, NPA-NXX: 213-362, CLLI: 
LSAJCAWZH04 (each location described in (a) and (b) above being the 
applicable "Demarcation Point"), for a total of 2,446 Vertical and Horizontal 
(DS-0) Miles.

Currency  (cannot be revised)
from:
"The price is quoted in US Dollars per unit of volume, which will be the 
Contractual Currency."

to
"The price is quoted in Dollars per DS-0 mile per DS-0 per Bandwidth Unit per 
Period (i.e. one month), which will be the contractual currency."

Unit of Measure
from:


to:
The Contract Price per Bandwidth Unit per Period (i.e. one month) is 
calculated as follows: Quoted Price x the  number of DS-0s per Bandwidth Unit 
x the number of Vertical and Horizontal (DS-0) Miles.  The Service Level 
Agreement applicable to this Product Description is set forth in Exhibit C-2 
to the GTCs.
