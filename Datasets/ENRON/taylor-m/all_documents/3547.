(1) Our entry into ag trading, as it will entail restrictions we are not 
accustomed to having to deal with.  In addition to black-letter restrictions, 
the general political/regulatory climate and attitude is much less permissive 
than it is with respect to the other types of trading we've done to date.  I 
think the risk should be thought of in three categories: (a) regulatory -- 
risk of an enforcement action; (b) political -- risk of alienation of 
legislators/regulators/powerful constituencies, which could affect all of our 
businesses, and (c) publicity -- particularly if we end up trading with 
farmers, and farmers suffer significant losses as a result of trading with 
us.  I personally think all of these risks are manageable, but they must be 
carefully addressed, which will require appropriate training of all traders 
involved.

(2) Trading of credit derivatives -- risk of defamation of credit liability
