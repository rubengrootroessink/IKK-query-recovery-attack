Paul -

I am forwarding a draft supplemental indenture regarding disclosure that
Anker sent me last week. You and I have more than 50% of the issue, i.e. we
can implement this change and have more info from Bruce vis-a-vis the
utility project
and other items.  I have not hired counsel yet to review this but would be
apt to use Coudert Brothers (at the Company expense of course) as they
worked on the restructuring for us. I thought it might make more sense for
your in-house counsel to review first and let us know how it would relate to
setting up walls and easing any disclosure/confidentiality risks it could
cause.


Regards,


David Storper

Attached is a draft of the Supplemental Indenture which would effect the
amendment to Section 4.3 of the Indenture that you and Bruce recently
discussed. As you will see, the amendment deletes the second sentence of
Section 4.3 that currently requires us to file reports with the SEC and
replaces it with the obligation to post the information on a website the we
own, lease or maintain. The rest of the Section is unchanged.

Please let me know if you have any comments on the new language for Section
4.3. I look forward to hearing from you.

Thanks, Judd
