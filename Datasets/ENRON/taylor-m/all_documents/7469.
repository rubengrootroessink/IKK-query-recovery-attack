Mark:

I had a chat with our people in Mexico and, as Mark Haedicke had warned me, 
they are very eager for me to go there.  They asked whether I could go there 
next week.  I think the purpose of the trip is to meet and for them to kind 
of let me know what they have.

I have no idea what if any, policy you have for travelling.  All things being 
equal, for me, the less travel the better but by the same token, I have 
absolutely no problem about going where I need to go.  I think these people 
in Mexico just need a little "hand holding"  for a while. 

How do you want to deal with respect to my travelling?  Do you want to 
approve (or not) whenever I have to go or just want to know in advance?  

Thanks

FPL
