Tickets are in your name for the 19th of Novemeber leaving JFK to San Juan
at 6:00am.  Just see if you drop the Tortola portion of the flight - right

getting there so early

 I will check if the USVI is part of the US for my purposes.  I get
confused
 regarding what is the US and what is part of the US imperial system.

 Also, if we are a boat leaving US territory and then
reentering.....will we
 still not have to go through US customs?  I cannot have a customs
 official looking up a computer and seeing that I have left the
country and
 thereby invalidating my green applications.  If USVI and BVI have a
close
 relationship
 and they are not too fussed fine....but somehow I cannot see US
immigration
 not being fussed.

 I do not want to spoil the holiday for you guys, and I know you are
not keen
 on sailing within the confines of USVI (even if I can get there and
that is
 another whole problem), so this is just a heads-up I may have to
abandon
 ship.

 PS     Gregg - do you have the flight details...so I can see if I
can change
 to USVI?
