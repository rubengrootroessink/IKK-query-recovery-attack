I agree with your point in Ned's memo.  We would not be relying on Part 30.10 
at all for non-LME business.  That business would be subject to the CFTC's 
swap exemption.

I am enclosing a directive with respect to marketing pursuant to your 
request.  I will be sending you a separate memo on marketing limitations that 
apply to Enron Metals Ltd.  These are not new and should be well known to 
MG.  Let's discuss.
