Al, Jon,

Please see below.  I had a couple of questions:

I assume that the MG entity will be MG London Inc.?
the Enron Corp Guaranty would be in favour of whom, presumably NYMEX?

Thanks.
Justin

Don't know if you are aware but Enron are currently executing NYMEX trades 
through different 3rd party brokers, and it is now proposed that they put all 
their trades through MG (who are brokers to NYMEX).  In order to do this, the 
New York operation will need:

An unconditional Corp guarantee for $28 million.
In due course further capital, probably in the form of a sub loan.

In the short term, they will be able to migrate 1 or 2 of their existing 
brokerage accounts with just the guarantee.  Anne - can you run this by Ben?

FYI the guy running this out of NY is called Al Pennisi (212 715 5845).

This is currently being handled in Houston by Brent Price and David Dupre.

Rgds

Bill
