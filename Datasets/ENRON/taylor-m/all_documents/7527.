Mark, has any thought been given to following the practice in North America 
that has apparently been adopted by the London office of not sending the GTC 
with the omnibus confirm and simply including language referring the 
counterparty to the GTC online?  Our operations people in Calgary have asked 
me, and I thought I would get your thoughts on the matter.

Also, I had heard that there has been talk of doing away entirely with 
following up EOL transactions with paper confirms and, instead, relying 
simply on the electronic transaction as confirmation of the deal.  Is there 
any likelihood of that practice occuring any time soon?

Can you let me know?

Thanks

Greg

Let me know your thoughts on the possibility of not sending the EOL GTC's to 
the counterparty as outlined below.

Tana,

Can Houston accomplish the below?  London is about to stop sending the Annex 
A (GTC) with their omnibus.  I think this would save a lot of fax headaches 
(and paper) on our end.  Let me know if it's ok and we'll set it up 
immediately.

Thanks,
Joe

Amita,

Justin has agreed that it would be OK to stop sending GTC's with confirms and 
instead include the following language on the confirms for EnronOnline 
transactions which are governed under GTC (not governed by Master Agreements):

"This Transaction is governed by the EnronOnline General Terms and 
Conditions. For a copy of this agreement, please click on the Product 
Description on the EnronOnline website and choose "View GTC".

Justin: Please verify that I have the language correct as per our discussion.

Thanks,

Dave
