Below please find some additional minor information I recently received from 
the people at Elektro.

Regards,
Luiz

Carlos E. Bianchini

We did not identify any company contained in the list as Elektro's client.  
Howerver, the following similarities in company names were identified:

Basf  AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT  -   We found Basf S A - S?tio S?o Jo?o - Santo 
Ant"nio de Posse

BG Group plc - We found BG Brasil  Ind Alim Ltda - Estrada de Angatuba  -  
Angatuba

Eaton Corporation  -  We found Eaton Ltda Divis?o de Trasmiss?o  -  Rod SP 
340 Canteiro de Obras - Mogi Mirim

Litton Industries, Inc.  -  We found Litton do Brasil Ltda - Rodovia D Pedro 
I - Jarinu

Texaco Limited  -  We found Texaco Brasil - Av. Carlos A. C. Pinto, 486  -  
Atibaia

Jose Hilario Farina Portes

We did not have any directly dealing with most of the listed companies.
We would like, however, to mention Cooper, Industrues Inc. (former 
McGraw-Edison Company), who supplied a significant number of restarters 
("religadores") type KF, and Oracle who we will most likely use as foundation 
for our technical systems.

Rob;

Due to Randy's 2-week trip to London, I am not sure if you have received any 
of this.

As per Federico Cerisoli's information, with respect to fuel transactions 
concerns, we are having discussions in Brazil and Bolivia with subsidiaries 
of some of the names I've seen in the file such as: BP Amoco; BG; Exxon 
Mobil; Shell; Total.  These discussions are only about physical transactions 
and never about credit derivatives.

With respect to Argentina, please see Mike Guerriero's comments below.

Regards,

Sami

Argentine ISDAs let me know.
