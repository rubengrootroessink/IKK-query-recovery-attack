This is a wrap-up email to inform all of you about the dates, activities and 
where we are standing with regards to the expansion of EOL to the Mexican 
Market.   The general strategy is to target the 40 major key customers 
directly, through two  formal presentations. One on Thursday August 3rd in 
Monterrey, at the  Quinta Real Hotel; and the second one on Friday August 4th 
in Mexico City, at the Four Seasons Hotel.   The setting is pretty much a 
Continental breakfast, followed by welcoming remarks and the formal 
presentation of EOL.

We plan to send out the invitations with the brochures around July 15th.  Kal 
Shah is planning on delivering around 600 spanish-translated EOL Ball 
Brochures in the next days. The brochures will have a cover letter that will 
include the Guest Accounts for the customers that will be invited to the 
formal presentations. We will follow up with RSVP personal calls from the 
15th to the 3rd. The rest of the customers will receive the brochure by mail. 

Jeff Blumenthal is helping us on the Tax Issues regarding on-line 
transactions by Mexican Counterparties. Jeff is almost finishing on checking 
the Tax implications on the products most probably traded by the targeted 
customers, as well as all other products listed on EOL. 

Carol St Claire is helping us on all the legal issues, as well as reviewing 
the marketing material that would be sent out to customers. We should have a 
formal opinion in the next days. 

Eric Thode is putting together the press releases to be sent on the launching 
date, and is also helping us with a plan to invite and inform the media about 
the event as well as EOL service. Eric, please send a copy of the press 
releases to Carol, since there are some words we need to avoid on the legal 
side of things.

Paul Radous and Rod Nelson are helping us with the pre-approval of credit for 
all of these targeted customers to be able to transact in EOL. 

Leonardo Pacheco is helping us on several fronts, and specially coordination 
of this effort, as well as getting all the guest accounts for the customers, 
together with Frank Davies. Leonardo please send a bunch of  Getting Started 
manuals as soon as you can. 

Daniel Diamond will help us with the marketing material and strategy. Dan let 
me know who will be attending the presentations on your behalf, and type of 
aid we will need in the Hotels. 

Let me know who is planning to attend so we can help with reservations and 
travel arrangements, or call directly Barbara Martinez at 011-52-8-152-2404.

I really appreciate all of your support and great work.  I am looking forward 
to successfully concluding the "Approval" process in the next days so we can 
move forward with the logistics, and please let me know how else can I help.

Kind Regards,   Jaime Williams.
