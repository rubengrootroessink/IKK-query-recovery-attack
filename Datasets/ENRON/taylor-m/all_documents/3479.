Subject: Enron Australia Masters

At the request of David Minns their short name in Lotus Notes will be EAF 
(for Enron Australia Finance).   David gave me a list of their masters, so I 
am going to enter just the names and agreement.  David and Alison will flesh 
out the rest of the data when he gets back.
