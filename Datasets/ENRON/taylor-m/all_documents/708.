Edmund,

Could you please confirm this wording is OK for Europe and amend the=20
w/collateral GTC's to incorporate the revision?

The primary purpose of this change is to create a default event in the even=
t=20
that the credit support defaults.

Note: I have changed the last word in the clause from Transaction to GTC,=
=20
with Mark Taylor's approval.

Thanks,

Dave
