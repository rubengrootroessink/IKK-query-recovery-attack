For Houston attorneys only:  In an effort to forecast our legal expenses, 
accounting has asked for an estimate of our outside legal expenses.  Please 
send me the total dollar amount of the legal invoices that you have received 
but haven't yet processed to be paid.  Also, if you have knowledge of charges 
but have not yet received an invoice, please try and give me an estimate of 
what those charges might be as well.  I need to have your estimates by NOON 
tomorrow, Thursday, April 19.   Call me if you have any questions.
