Thanks, Mark.

I also wanted to ask you if Tana could spend an hour with me and a few other 
attorney's to go over how Enron negotiates an ISDA.  We anticipate using 
ISDA's for semiconductor trading and I would be real hard pressed to do a 
respectable job today.  I do not think our department has anyone who is up to 
speed on how to negotiate an ISDA agreement from Enron's point of view.  I 
welcome any suggestions you may have.  Thanks
