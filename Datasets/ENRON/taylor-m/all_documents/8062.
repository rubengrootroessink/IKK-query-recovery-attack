Per Mark Taylor's phone call this afternoon, please review the attached list 
of what you currently show in the database as elected postions.



Please advise as to any positions which should be removed, added, amended and 
the effective date for each as to ensure authority for anything you have 
already signed.

Sincerely,

Matt Maxwell
