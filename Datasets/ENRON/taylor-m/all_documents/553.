Dear Bob and Dave,

Following our review of the website text today, Louise has asked me to flag a 
business process requirement in respect of the Contact EnronOnline.

It has been decided to remove the reference and hotlink to the Legal & 
Privacy statement from underneath the "I would like to request a Guest 
Read-Only account" wording in Section 4 of the website text.  As a result, we 
need to ensure, as part of the business process, that there is text in the 
email which is sent out to the party requesting a Guest Account stating that 
the Guest Accounts are bound by the Legal & Privacy statement.  

If you have any queries please feel free to contact myself or Justin.

Regards, Edmund.
