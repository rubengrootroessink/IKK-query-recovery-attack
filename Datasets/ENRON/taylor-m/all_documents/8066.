It is a little more complicated than that but we are working as fast as we 
can.  These due diligence issues involve a lot of moving parts and a lot of 
people so it doesn't always move as fast as we would like it to.  I have a 
call scheduled today with Anguillan counsel but it will take more than one 
call to figure out what all the issues are.  I will keep you informed of our 
progress.

Brent.. can you try to come up with a conclusion on Angwila (what it will 
take to deal there) by Tuesday.. Paul, Bill and I are going to see them 
Thursday and would like to be able to discuss issues with them.  My 
understanding is that as long as we can legally recoup our funds..we can deal 
with them.. we just might have to charge more collateral...

Please let me know..

I have been told that we need to do the full due diligence. I will do 
everything in my power to expedite the process and get it done in a 
reasonable amount of time.
Regards,
Brent
