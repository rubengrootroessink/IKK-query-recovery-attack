On issues that have advanced beyond the stage of commercial solutions such as 
in the case of Vitra and Piedra Buena I would like to make it clear that 
legal holds full responsibility for the advancement and resolution of these 
issues. All responsibility and accountability lies in the hands of the 
lawyers unless or until they request commercial assistance. This division of 
responsibility is intended to eliminate  internal communication issues, 
establish clear external communication with the counterparty, give clear and 
full empowerment to the attorneys, and better manage the time needed to 
resolve these issues.

The lawyers will take responsibility for keeping commercial informed at all 
key points of the process. I will maintain final approval on significant 
decisions throughout the proceedings.

MFG
