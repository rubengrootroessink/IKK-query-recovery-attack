Excellent but somewhat disconcerting article discussing legal trends towards 
creating 'borders' on the web akin to the physical world legal realities. 
Also, good bits on geolocation software and the like.  Obvious implications 
for EnronOnline and other Net Works sites going forward.

real borders. Jurisdictional laws could mean that online publishers
decide either to keep some material off the Internet entirely or to
install online gates and checkpoints around their sites.
