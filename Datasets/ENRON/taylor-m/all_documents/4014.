Here I am AGAIN!

Janet just called to say that she didn't get something for Elena that you
might want to get.  It is at Crate and Barrel, item #28129 - Cooking set
- $19.95.  There are little aluminum pans, wooden spoon, stainless whisk,
potholder & mitt and plastic measuring spoons.  It was on the list they
sent us, but since Janet had wanted to get it (before she changed her
mind and got make up and dress up stuff instead), I didn't put it on the
list I sent to you.

Love, Mother
