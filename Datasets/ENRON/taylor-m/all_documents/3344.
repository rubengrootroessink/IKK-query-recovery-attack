Enron Europe has asked that they be given a power of attorney to sign 
standard form trading guarantees. Jim Derrick and Ben Glisan have approved 
this. Attached is the form of guaranty they want to use. Does this form seem 
appropriate to you? Thanks!

Scott,

sorry for the delay. Here is the standard form Corp guarantee we would 
propose to execute in the UK to support trading operations.

Look forward to hearing from you further.

Hope all is well.

     Mark

This would cover both financial and physical trades (i.e. ECTRL and ECTRIC), 
and whether under a master or otherwise
