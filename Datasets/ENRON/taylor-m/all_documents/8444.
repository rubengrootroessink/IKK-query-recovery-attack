With Mitsui, could we have one ISDA master signed by all affilaites or would 
we have to do separate masters with a master netting agreement? Your thoughts?

Thanks for the help Alan.  Moving forward though, if it turns out that London 
and/or Singapore are negotiating ISDAs with Mitsui (as we think they are), 
what do we do about Mitsui's concern that it doesn't want to have separate 
ISDAs with separate Enron entities.  

What is Enron's usual approach to this I wonder.  Seems to me that from the 
customer's perspective, this makes sense.  I wonder what sort of internal 
issues this raises though.  

Lets talk tomorrow morning.

Jane

I think Matt Lee may be negotiating one with Mitsui, but I'm not absolutely 
sure.

Matt: Could you confirm? Thanks.

Matt/Edmund,

Laurie and I are trying to help Jane determine if an ISDA with Mitsui Corp. 
has been negotiated by London and Singapore.  Tana Jones has checked the 
Financial Trading Agreements database and found no records of an ISDA with 
Mitsui.  Do you by any chance no if such agreement has been negotiated and 
perhaps is waiting to be entered into the database?  If an ISDA does exist 
with Mitsui, would you be so kind to contact Jane directly with details, etc.

Thanks and regards,

Nony

No ISDA for Mitsui Corp.  Below is the link which should enable you view 
access to the Financial Trading Agreement Database.  You can forward this 
email with the link to any member of your team and they will then have the 
link which will get them access to the database.

Tana, would you be able to check on Mitsui Corp. ISDAs for us?  Thanks.  If I 
can access the database please let me know.

Above company has approached us re an ISDA with them, they have also told us 
that they have been negotiating ISDAs with Enron London and Enron Singapore 
for some time.

**************

Laurie/Nony,

I wonder if you can find out for me from the data base, what the status is 
with Mitsui Corp. ISDAs re all Enron companies?  

***************

Alan,

Mitsui Corp has hinted that it doesn't want to have separate ISDAs with 
separate Enron entities.  What is Enron's usual approach to this I wonder.  
Seems to me that from the customer's perspective, this makes sense.  I wonder 
what sort of internal issues this raises though.

**********************

Thanks all.

Jane
