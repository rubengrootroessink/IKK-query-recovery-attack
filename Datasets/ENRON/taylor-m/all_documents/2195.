FYI,  This is the offending email.  I received a call while I was doing the=
=20
home inspection from Andrea.  She was very upset.  Mike promised to speak=
=20
forceably to John and supposedly has done so but I wanted Mike to know that=
 I=20
wanted him to get inbetween John and Andrea.  John can be very difficult to=
=20
deal with and Mike knows this.  I think Mike apprecaites the role Andrea=20
plays and I hope he can do more to get a few of the business guys under=20
control.

Subject: Sicamar

Last night I had a long chat on the phone with Sicamar's president Mr.=20
Domingo Cabado over the possibilty of them not purchasing gas from us at th=
e=20
Citygate as it was agreed with them on April 27.
These are some of the reasons we discussed over the phone:

At a meeting of "metal?rgicos" held this week he was informed  that Litoral=
=20
Gas was 30 % owned by the Techint group. He was also informed of how=20
"worried" Techint was about Open Access and it's consequences on related=20
companies of the "italian" group (TGN, Litoral, Siderca, Siderar,etc)=20
Litoral Gas had enough time to investigate what kind of relationship linked=
=20
Sicamar's business to Techint's related companies.
Our lack of fast response to send out a document that was commercially agre=
ed=20
on April 27 and only needed minor changes to the original document that was=
=20
sent out back to the customer four weeks later. This gave Litoral Gas enoug=
h=20
time to approach Techint's headquarters and threaten Sicamar that their=20
commercial relationship with Techint's related companies could be damaged.

Mr. Cabado told me that Sicamar was ready to go with us a month ago but the=
se=20
new issues made him doubt on what was verbally agreed with us.

I personally believe that probably Sicamar wouldn=01%t have closed a deal w=
ith=20
us anyway but a certain doubt remains in my mind of what would have happene=
d=20
if we had delivered in time our Offer.
Prebon (Sicamar's consultant) also mentioned this to me and had warned me=
=20
(during May) about the time we were giving Litoral Gas to react. I coincide=
d=20
but also told him that Techint's pressure on Sicamar was also a main factor=
=20
of their negative decission to our offer.

I believe communication needs to be improved among the commercial team and=
=20
the legal department. We have had in the past these problems and at some=20
stage were resolved with a couple of meetings we had with Brent and Andrea.=
=20
For some reason we are falling into the trap again of "lack of communicatio=
n"=20
and I would suggest to follow the course we started some months ago that=20
turned to be very benefitial for the office as a whole.

I openly invite those who are concerned over this issue to discuss it as so=
on=20
as we can.=20

The good thing about my conversation with Mr. Cabado was that he would be=
=20
interested in what can Enron offer to him on an Energy Services approach. I=
=20
told him that we should discuss this in more depth in the near future.
