If the NDA is the Confidentiality Agreement for the Energy Trading Platform 
(group of six?), I have marked it up with only those revisions I thought 
essential (having discussed them with Andy) and am now waiting to hear back 
regarding where I should send it (have left voice mail for Greg and Andy is 
checking).

If the NDA is something else, please let me know.
