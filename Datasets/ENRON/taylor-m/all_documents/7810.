I decided to email instead of taking up more room in your
voicemail!   I just wanted to let you know that I found
some cheaper tickets into St Thomas.   I hate St. Thomas
from what I remember, but we would not really be there
long I guess.   Just so you know there are nonstop
flights to St Thomas from BWI for $500.   (The flights
into Tortola are in the $700 range).   I think that Bill
and I are going to use miles unless the prices drop down
below the 500$ range so it does not matter so much for us,
but I just wanted to check that I should only look at
flights into Tortola right?

Also, does it matter which airport on Tortola?  I cannot
remember which is the close one to the Moorings.  Is it
Beef Isl, Tortola code EIS or West end Tortola airport code
TOV?

Finally,  about the return flights.   Mom's only input
(so far) is that she wants to enjoy the million dollar
hotel in VA for the days that she is paying for it.
Meaning she wants to spend some time there on Friday the
18th.     Therefore, the options seem to be:

 (a) to fly into C'ville late on Thursday night.  In
this case you could stay at my house in C'ville.

 (b) To fly into DC on Thursday night then drive
immediately down to C'ville and stay at my house.
(c'ville is about 1.5hrs from Dulles; 2 hrs from National
and 3+ from BWI).

 (b) To fly into DC on Thursday night.  Stay in a
hotel in DC then have a pretty, leisurly drive down to
C'ville on Fri morning.


What do you think?

The slight problem with (a) FOR ME is that if I use the
award promotion on American (the pay some and use some
miles thing) then I need to fly only on American and
American does not fly to C'ville.   This means that I will
need to purchase a separate ticket on Usair or some
other airline.   Also, if I want to fly down with Bill then
my car will be in DC so I will need to pick that up anyway
so I will probably need to do the drive anyway.

I am going to pay for my mom's ticket, so I can have her do
whatever!   Even if I end up in DC for the night the two of
you could continue on to C'ville by plane and stay at my
house.    SOrry, this is confusing, let me know you
thoughts.
