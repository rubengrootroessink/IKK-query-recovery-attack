Amita -- here are my comments (don't believe I have sent these on to you 
yet!).   What are the plans for approvals, etc.?   Can I circulate to 
McKeever, Hutchinson and Farmer for input (i.e. as the generic letter)?   
Thanks, Fiona

Hi Fiona

Sorry - forgot to send it to you last week.

Please let me know whether the addition of some info would make this suit 
your needs as well as ours.

Regards

Amita

Thanks a lot for your feedback,  We have incorporated your suggestions and 
have revised the letter.  We have tried to make it more concise and less 
EnronOnline/MITS specific.

Please let us know what you think.  Your view points are appreciated.

Jayshree and Molly
