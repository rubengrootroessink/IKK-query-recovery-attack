Dave:

Our right to use Dow Jones name other than with the content under license is 
restricted to use that is pre-approved by Dow Jones.  Thus, you need to make 
sure that every reference to Dow Jones (other than the actual link to the 
publications and the publications themselves) is pre-approved by Dow Jones.  
I'm not sure what type (if any) of permission we have received from Reuters 
and the other trade publications to use their name on the web site and/or in 
marketing materials other than in connection with the publication of their 
content.  I alerted Kal Shah to the fact that we would need express 
authorization to use their names in marketing efforts, both hard copy and 
on-line, weeks ago but am not sure what, if any, approvals have been 
obtained.  In looking over the test web site, I noted at least one place 
where we refer to the various publications and was concerned whether we had 
obtained approval to market the names.

Please follow up with Mark Taylor on this matter if we don't touch base.

Leslie
