Yes we are here permanently, if the tenure gods cooperate; I am teaching at 
Amherst
College, in the Department of Fine Arts.  Gemma is 3 1/2 and we are expecting 
her
sister at the end of June, things are good given the upheaval moving 
entails.  We
are going to be in Houston in March for the opening of the new building at 
the MFA,
it's a tight trip but maybe we can have coffee or something, email me a phone 
number
where we can get in touch.

Nice to hear from you
