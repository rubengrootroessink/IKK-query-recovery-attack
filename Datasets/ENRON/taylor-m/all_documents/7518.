Hey Mark,

Grant Oh of the Calgary office has been approached with respect to the 
posting by BC Gas of certain prices from Enron Online.

I have given Grant some feedback as to some issues which immediately come to 
mind (i.e. protection of intellectual property rights, protection of the 
rights we reserve in our Enron Online agreements, limitation of liability, 
etc).  

However, I also thought that it is likely that this type of request has been 
made in the past by other website hosts.  Being "THE Enron Online guy", as my 
colleague Greg Johnston points out, I was wondering if you were aware of any 
such similar request.

Could you let me know when you get the chance?  My direct number is (403) 
974-6708.

Thanks, 

Mark.

Mark - wanted your thougths on what legal traps we need to run to make sure 
BC Gas can do this...  It would be commercially prudent to have our name and 
price out there but there are issues.

What might be most commercially preferable is to provide a timed delayed web 
link from EOL to the BC Gas website - any thoughts Bob?

Cheers gents..

Grant

Dear Grant,

As per our telephone conversation, I'm requesting permission to post the
Sumas Bid Price as quoted on Enron's daily pricing sheet.  I am revising our
web graphics, which consist of summer and winter forward strips and am
wanting to quote the Sumas Bid Price for the current year, past year and
next gas year.  Our graphs will be updated once a week on Tuesdays, and will
therefore assume Tuesday's Bid Price at Sumas.  All graphics will visibly
cite Enron Canada Corp.

I would appreciate your consideration regarding this request.  If this
request is accepted, please provide disclaimer information to be included on
all graphics.

Yours truly,


Melissa Philion
