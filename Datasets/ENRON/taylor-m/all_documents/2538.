David,

Based on the e-mail that I sent out on June 30th (and that I have attached=
=20
below), I was under the presumption that the Enron party to the GTCs would =
be=20
Enron Australia Finance Pty Ltd.  This is because we are dealing with=20
Australian weather derivatives and I was presuming (right or wrong) that su=
ch=20
derivatives would be on the books of the Sydney trading office.  Please let=

me know if this is not the case.

Best regards,
Susan

There is also a question as to whether the Enron party will be Enron=20

On a related issue what Enron company is on the Passwords Applications and=

Subject: Tax Advice on AUS and JPN CDD and HDD Weather Swaps

Below is a summary of the tax advice that I received from our outside=20
advisors in Tokyo and Sydney on the Sydney trading office entering into cas=
h=20
settled weather derivative trades with Japanese counterparties:

Japanese Tax Advice

1. Swap, Options and Other Financial Derivative Transactions

Based on the current practice of the Japanese tax authorities, standard=20
swaps, options and similar financial transactions with symmetrical payment=
=20
flows should not be subject to withholding tax. However, to the extent that=
=20
Enron transactions involve asymmetrical payments, concern exists that imput=
ed=20
interest from the imbedded loan could be subject to interest withholding ta=
x.

2. Consumption Tax (VAT) and Excise Taxes

Although Japan imposes a 5% consumption tax (VAT), financial transactions a=
re=20
generally not subject to the consumption tax, so cash settled derivative=20
transactions should generally not be subject to consumption tax.  Japan=20
imposes various kinds of excise taxes.  These excise taxes generally apply =
to=20
physical importation and domestic sale and delivery of covered products and=
=20
should generally not apply to purely financial derivatives transactions whi=
ch=20
reference commodity prices.

3. Collateral for Derivatives Transactions

If Enron entities will take collateral from Japan-based customers in=20
connection with derivative transactions, depending upon the specific=20
arrangements, withholding tax liability might arise.  For example, if an=20
Enron trading entity takes cash collateral from a Japan-based customer and=
=20
pays interest on it, such interest payments could be subject to local=20
withholding tax when paid to the Japanese resident customer.


Australian Tax Advice

1. Swap, Options and Other Financial Derivative Transactions

Based on the summaries of the products attached to Justin Timothy=01,s June=
 12th=20
e-mail to Mario Parra Cardoso and Dale Neuner:

(1) the swap income or deduction should be recognized on a due and payable=
=20
basis (rather than on an accrual basis over the term of the swap), and
(2) there should not be any interest withholding tax imposed on the swap=20
payments because there does not appear to be any linkage between the swap=
=20
payment and "interest" as defined for Australian tax purposes.

Note that there is an Australian tax proposal to impose withholding tax on=
=20
other Australian source income.  Although no details are yet available, it =
is=20
expected that the Australian government will not impose withholding tax whe=
re=20
the income would constitute "business profits" of any entity in a treaty=20
country (such as Japan) which does not have permanent establishment in=20
Australia.  Thus, based on the current proposal, it is unlikely that such a=
=20
withholding tax, if enacted, would apply to the swap payments.  However, th=
is=20
could change depending upon the rules actually enacted.

2. GST (VAT)

Effective July 1, 2000, the Goods and Services Tax ("GST") will tax at a 10=
%=20
rate the consumption of most goods and services in Australia.  (It does not=
=20
apply to consumption outside of Australia, e.g. exports.)

A swap payment to a Japanese counterparty will be GST-free. This means that=
=20
the Australian trading office would be able to claim refunds on a portion o=
f=20
the GST paid on its rents and other expenses.


Please let me know if you have any questions or need any additional=20
information.

Best regards,
Susan
