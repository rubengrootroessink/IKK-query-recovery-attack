Per my voice mail,  attached is an alternative to the language originally
proposed re:  statutory reference in the ISDA choice of law clause.  David
Mitchell and I discussed the issue and believe that the statutory reference
is fine. We note that the statutory threshold --  contracts "arising out of
a transaction covering in the aggregate not less than $250,000"  -- will
likely be met either with each confirm individually or with all confirms in
the aggregate .

Please do not hesitate to contact David at (212) 504-6285 or me at (212)
504-6261 to discuss this further.

(See attached file: Governing Law.doc)As we discussed, enclosed is the
standard choice of law provision of our ISDA schedule, red-lined to show
how the statutory reference might be worded.  Mark Taylor and I are
interested in your thoughts on the matter. -- Bob
