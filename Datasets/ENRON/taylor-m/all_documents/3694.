Andy and Sheri:

Here is a draft of what I propose Mark Frevert and Mark Haedicke send out to 
the traders re use of third-party electronic trading platforms.  Note that I 
included a contact for questions at the bottom of the policy.  I have listed 
myself for now -- who would you like to designate?  Will this e-mail go out 
to European and other business units as well, and if so, from the same 
senders?

Mark Taylor has approved the e-mail and the policy.

Let me know what you think.  I will circulate to Mark Haedicke for approval 
as soon as I receive your comments and/or approval.

Leslie

if you would like to trade on such a trading platform.
All registration and other documentation must be sent to the ENW designee,

You are not authorized to use a third-party electronic trading platform until 
you are authorized by ENW.
