Mark:

Attached please find the policy I have drafted relating to use of third party 
trading platforms.  I think it would be a good idea to spell out the types of 
trading platforms this policy is intended to address.  We can either prepare 
an e-mail for circulation from Frevert and Whaley attaching a final version 
of the policy or just build the policy into the text of the e-mail.  Please 
let me know if you have any revisions/changes to the policy before I send to 
Andy for his review.

Thanks,

Leslie
