Leonardo -- I have spoken to Ed Baughman about your communication below.  He 
has indicated that we will shelve the summer 2000 product offering but that 
it is still desirable to offer the second product, minus its Summer 2000 
portion.  That is, the power desk would like to get up and running as soon as 
possible the same website and auction rules, offering Summer 2001-2002 
Capacity and Energy as the sole initial product.   Please either take a run 
at revising the website text to remove product one and the reference to 
Aug-Sept 2000 in product two, or send me the most recent revision so that I 
can make these deletions.  Additionally, feel free to call me with any 
questions.  --David.

David,

We have talked to our development team and we have concluded that we will not 
be able to have the auction site up and running before August 14th. As we 
have discussed previously, it usually takes around 3 to 4 weeks to develop an 
auction site. However, due to the various projects that our developers are 
working on this timeline has been extended.  

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks!
