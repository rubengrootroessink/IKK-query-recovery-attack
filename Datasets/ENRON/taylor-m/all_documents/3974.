As you know, Dan and I had worked up the locations for the EGM lawyers. You 
have a copy of that workseet.

I think we just need to add the three paralegals Larry, Martha, and Sara into 
the three cubicle slots against the 38C1 Conference Room wall. Please go 
ahead and do this. I understood that Janette would indicate where the 
assistants would be located.

If you need anything else, please advise. Thanks.

Alan

I have just received confirmation that December 29th is available for the 
"BIG MOVE."  I need to get the room assignments, etc. so I can submit the 
request no later than tomorrow.  

Thanks.
