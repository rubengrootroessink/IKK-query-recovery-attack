John, as you requested, here is information on how to get in to the 
Clickpaper staging environment.  Anytime you want to go in and check out the 
site content or try out the auction, please go ahead.

The version running out there is the version we are currently testing (in a 
different environment.)  This version has known bugs that we are working to 
fix.  If you come across anything that you think we should know about (like a 
bug, a usability problem, or something that needs improving), please email, 
call, or trip me when I walk by.  I can quickly determine if we are already 
working on the problem or if it should be added to our list.

URL is http://testpulpweb1.ecomtest.enron.com

Available ID's:
trader1 through trader20.  You will want to use more than one id to simulate 
posting a sell or buy, and then responding to that posting.
password for all id's is test.

Any questions, let me know.
