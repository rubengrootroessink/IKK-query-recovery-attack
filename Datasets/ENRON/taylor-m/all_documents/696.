Please review the attached letter for annoucing eClearinghouse to potential 
investors.  I would like to provide this letter with the presentation brief 
(attached) and a Non-Disclosure Agreement next week in Houston.  For parties 
which complete an NDA, a more detailed binder whould be provided along with a 
MOU.

Edmund is preparing an MOU and NDA.

Please advise!

Thanks,

David
