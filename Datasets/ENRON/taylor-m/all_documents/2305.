All,

I realise this is an aggressive timeframe, but it is important that we prove 
to both MG and outside observers that Enron can quickly and efficiently enter 
new businesses and put them onto EnronOnline.

Successfully putting MG onto EnronOnline in record time will pay dividends as 
investors start to appreciate the EnronNetWorks strategy and the broader 
Enron model.

Thanks to everyone who is working hard to make this happen.

Dave

Hi Guys

As a result of the change in plan detailed below we will need the following 
additional work to be completed:

- Legal counsel to be instructed to carry out due diligence for jurisdictions 
which are not currently covered and appear on the initial "A" list - see 
Justin's  email to Mark Taylor
- Metals due diligence for all existing jurisdictions 
- Finalisation of GTCs - need draft by Friday 16th i.e this week!

Please let me know if you have any queries.

Regards

Amita

Subject: Counterparties to whom metals products will be available

Hi Guys

Slight change of plan on the counterparty front - we will be offering all 
metals products (currently two phys products) to the following counterparties:

- All companies on new "A" list  (see Enron aluminium list.doc and Enron 
copper list.doc below)
- All companies on the old "A" list (where we have a PA for the countries 
they are trading from)  (see tif file below)
- All exisiting companies on EnronOnline (list as in EOL - copy will be 
forwarded as soon as avail)

Please be aware that the companies on the new "A" list may be a subset of the 
companies on the old "A" list.

Please proceed with your review process on the basis of the above.

Both "A" lists are attached below for your ease of reference.

Regards

Amita
