I have since spoken with John Arnold and Joe Deffner regarding the matter.

Per John:  He sees some value in utilizing MG in the nature of broker fees 
reduction; however, his general estimate is only 2MM a year savings.  
However, he sees the value in the margin credit lines we now have and are 
continuing to increase.  I spoke with him briefly regarding the legal issues 
which I think he appreciated as significant.

Per Joe:  He also sees a limited economic advantage in respect of the broker 
fees.  However, he thinks the interest free margin lines provide us with 
greater value, in part due to increased liquidity and the insulation from 
funds flow volatility.  Joe thinks margin lines should be utilized first and 
then outside brokers.  He sees MG pretty much as any other outside broker.

If you have any questions, call.
