Travis,

Thanks for your reply.  I will fax to you a copy of our request for
no-action relief to the CFTC.

Let me follow-up with the CFTC re your question on the issue of material
non-public information and we can discuss this later.  In the mean time if
you have any questions please contact me.

Joe Wright

Joe:

After speaking with Andy, I think it is fair to say that there is a
substantial (85% probability) that the clawback triggered by our closing a
deal with a competing platform will be triggered.  We will advise you if
and when it is definitely triggered.

As to the representation to the CFTC, we can certainly make the
representation regarding no basis for statutory disqualification pursuant
to Sections 8a(2) and 8a(3) of the Act.  However, we are a little bit
concerned about the application of the policies to prevent trading on
"material nonpublic information."  Most of our concern revolves around what
may be included within that term; certainly, it should not include
information that we receive from a customer submits to us through the
Posting Agreement, but in any event, a better idea of what the CFTC might
be concerned about here would be helpful.

Finally, would it be possible for us to get an advance copy of your request
for no action letter?  You may have sent it to us before, but if you did, I
can't locate it now.   I think it would be a good idea to get that in front
of our regulatory counsel as soon as possible and ask that they confirm
that the no-action letter that you get (assuming that they give you all the
relief that you have requested) will have everything that they think we
need.
