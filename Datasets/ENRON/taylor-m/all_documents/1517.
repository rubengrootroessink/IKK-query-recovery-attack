Marie:
Here are the 2 forms of letters that Jeff needs to sign.  The ECC letter 
assumes that the absence of litigation rep has been added.  Also, in the 
other new rep, haven't we deleted the word "draft" in clause (ii) in our ISDA 
form?

I have established Tuesday, March 21st as the deadline for responding.  I 
would like to get all of these sent out no later than Friday of this week to 
give them 7 Business Days to respond.  Is that do-able?   If so, then 
beginning, Wednesday, March 22nd, the confirms desk should start using the 
new Annex A.

We should be faxing them a clean and a marked version.

Thanks for all of your hard work on this.

Carol
