Mark - I don't think you got this last week. My apologies,   I know Net Works 
does its own report, but you need to get this to review the Financial Trading 
portion.  Could you take a look at it today by any chance?

     Reminder
     
It is time to update the Monthly Report for Mark Haedicke to send to Jim 
Derrick.  Please use a hard copy of the attached February report to mark 
changes for transactions as of today.  

Remember to add outside counsel (the firm name) where appropriate.

Give your hard copy changes to Dina Snow by the end of the day Tuesday, March 
13.

Thanks!
