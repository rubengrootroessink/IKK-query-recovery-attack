Comments:

1) Enron Net Work should probably be EnronOnline, LLC

2) 1. What is a Passport Application?

3) 3.  I agreed we wouldn't pass along any details of any bids to ENA 
employees. I don't know what all of this paragraph entails. Can you shed some 
light, or should we just ask them to reword it?

Dave

Mark, Taffy said you're under the weather. Hope you're feeling better by the 
time you open this. The attached draft is revised slightly from the one I 
previously sent to you for review. The changes are nonsubstantive from your 
standpoint - -  most of them were made to clarify that there will be 
offerings from the pipelines other than open seasons. In making the changes, 
I forgot to do a redlined draft for you, so I am faxing to you a copy 
redlined by hand. 

Thanks again for all your help.

Tony
