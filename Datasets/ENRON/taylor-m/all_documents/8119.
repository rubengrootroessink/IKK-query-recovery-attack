Good Morning Mark,

I have received a request for a Certificate of Incumbency demonstrating that 
I am an authorized officer to execute on behalf od ENA. Laurel Adams 
mentioned that you would be the appropriate person to contact. I have yet to 
sign an official Certificate of Incumbency. Please advise what we need to do 
to provide this document to Chali Zulu (Legal) in London, per her request 
below.

Thanks,

Jorge A. Garcia
