Mark,

We want to send this out tomorrow. Do you have any concerned with the LME or 
COMEX references as written?

Dave

Hi Guys

Greg requested a press release re metals transactions on EnronOnline.

I have made some amendments to the original press release prepared by Eric 
Thode and have amended the EnronOnline stats to reflect the stats contained 
in the most recent public report.

Could you please review the draft and forward comments asap.

Thanks

Amita
