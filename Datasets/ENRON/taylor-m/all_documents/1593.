I don't like amending GTC's - but would like to discuss this issue with you 
and/or Mark when convenient.

Thanks,

Dave

Subject: Update to Online GTC's

I understand from Mark that in order to open up the utilities to trade 
financial, we will need to amend the GTC's to add some additional reps and 
provisions.  Do you have a timetable for when we will be able to do that?
