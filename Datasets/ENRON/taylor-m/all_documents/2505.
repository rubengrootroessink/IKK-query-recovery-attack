Mark - As per Harry's request, I'm forwarding you the ICIS LOR Pricing 
Language for Methanol online trading:

The arithmetic average of the mean of the high and low prices as quoted
in ICIS-LOR Group LTD's Methanol Price Report in the section under 
Methanol (US Gulf) Contract Prices (FOB) - "Barge" (cts/gal) 
effective each day in the Delivery month for which such prices are
quoted (rounded to four (4) decimal places).

If the Contract Price for Methanol is no longer quoted by ICIS-LOR in
exactly the same format  as on the date hereof, then the parties will 
negotiate in good faith to determine an alternative price index
representing the Contract price of Methanol.

Thanks.
Nony
