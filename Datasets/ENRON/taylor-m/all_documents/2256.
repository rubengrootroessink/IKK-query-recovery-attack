I found out the problem was that I was not on the system.  I am now listed 
but am having trouble with certain of the functions.  I will work with HR 
here to get this done.  I selected the same list of reviewers online that I 
emailed you earlier.  Thanks.

ESA is in the middle of doing mid year reviews.  They have an automated 
system which I do not think I have access to because I work for ENA.  HR here 
is checking on how I can do the reviews for Andrea, Cecilia and Pia.  

With respect to ENA, if you are doing midyear reviews I would suggest the 
following reviewers, yourself, Lynn Aven, Andrea Calo, Maria Pia Beccaccini, 
and Mike Guerriero.

Let me know if I need to do anything else. 

Thanks,
Brent
