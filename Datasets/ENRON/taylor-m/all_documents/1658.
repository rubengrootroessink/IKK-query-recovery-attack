Martin,

IT IS ABSOLUTELY URGENT. PLEASE GIVE THIS YOUR IMMEDIATE ATTENTION

We need the confirmations tomorrow in Houston. Koch is ready to close the 
deal, but they have a few issues with legal and they need to see the confirms 
to get comfortable with the docs. Needless to say, this deal is very 
important for both us and them. This will be the first deal where two 
corporates will be doing a bankruptcy swap instead of default swap on cash 
settlement instead of physical delivery.  The only thing that is stopping us 
from doing this deal is the documents. Please ask Paul Simon to expedite the 
matter and get us the documents tomorrow so we can shoot them to Koch for 
their review.

Thanks and Regards
Moazzam
