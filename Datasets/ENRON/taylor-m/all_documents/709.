Just for clarification we did not use Sullivan & Cromwell for the Internet 
primarily we hired S&C as our financial/regulatory lawyers in the US the 
Internet issues were covered by Clifford Chance although obviously we were 
suffering with CC and used S&C to help us out but they had no expertise in 
the Internet and ecommerce.
