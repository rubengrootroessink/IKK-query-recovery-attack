Subject: Enron Online Japan - Tax Issues =20

I received advice today from our outside law firm in Tokyo regarding their=
=20
final conclusions on the Japanese tax issues relating to the non-Japanese=
=20
trading offices trading with Japanese counterparties. The following is a=20
summary of their advice:

A. Cash Settled Derivatives Transactions
1. Swap, Options and Other Financial Derivative Transactions

Based on the current practice of the Japanese tax authorities, standard=20
swaps, options and similar financial transactions with symmetrical payment=
=20
flows should not be subject to withholding tax. However, to the extent that=
=20
Enron transactions involve asymmetrical payments, concern exists that imput=
ed=20
interest from the imbedded loan could be subject to interest withholding ta=
x.

2. Consumption Tax (VAT) and Excise Taxes

Although Japan imposes a 5% consumption tax (VAT), financial transactions a=
re=20
generally not subject to the consumption tax, so cash settled derivative=20
transactions should generally not be subject to consumption tax.  Japan=20
imposes various excise taxes, some of which apply to commodities that are t=
he=20
subject to Enron Online transactions, such as petroleum excise tax.  Such=
=20
excise taxes generally apply to physical importation and domestic sale and=
=20
delivery of covered products and should generally not apply to purely=20
financial derivatives transactions which reference commodity prices.

3. Collateral for Derivatives Transactions

If Enron entities will take collateral from Japan-based customers in=20
connection with derivative transactions, depending upon the specific=20
arrangements, withholding tax liability might arise.  For example, if an=20
Enron trading entity takes cash collateral from a Japan-based customer and=
=20
pays interest on it, such interest payments could be subject to local=20
withholding tax when paid to the Japanese resident customer.

B. Physically Settled Transactions
1. Consumption Tax

Japan imposes consumption tax (VAT) on the importation of tangible goods an=
d=20
on domestic transfers of tangible goods. Consumption tax should be applicab=
le=20
to imports of all physical commodities indicated at the Enron Online websit=
e,=20
including natural gas, LNG, petroleum and derivatives, coal and pulp and=20
paper.  Consequently, commodity contracts for physical settlement should=20
provide that ownership of the commodity will pass outside Japan to the=20
Japan-based customer.  As owner of the products upon import, the Japan-base=
d=20
customer would act as importer for consumption tax purposes and in that=20
capacity would handle formalities upon import, pay import consumption tax a=
nd=20
then credit or seek a refund for the resulting input consumption tax.=20

If, instead, the title to the commodities is transferred after such=20
commodities enter Japan, each Enron entity that sells to Japan would be=20
required to register as a taxpayer for consumption tax purposes, pay=20
consumption tax upon import and file consumption tax returns.  While such a=
n=20
arrangement is feasible, in practice, other industries have encountered=20
resistance from customs authorities (who administer the import consumption=
=20
tax system) to the designation of a non-resident entity as formal importer.

2. Excise Tax

Japan imposes an excise tax on the importation and transfer of various=20
commodities, including natural gas, LNG, crude oil, and refined petroleum=
=20
products.  Petrochemicals may also be subject to excise tax depending upon=
=20
the specific product. Other commodities listed at the website, including=20
coal, plastics (except if a specific product were characterized as a=20
petrochemical subject to excise tax), and pulp and paper, are not subject t=
o=20
excise tax.  Again, Enron entities should transfer ownership of commodities=
=20
before they reach Japan so that the Japan-based customer acts as importer a=
nd=20
has responsibility for payment of excise taxes.

C. Tax Representations

The trading offices considered were those located in the US, the UK,=20
Singapore, Australia, Canada, Spain and Norway. Japan has tax treaties in=
=20
force with all of these countries.  Consequently, with respect to GTCs=20
entered into with these trading offices, the tax payor and payee=20
representations may provide that:

(1) the counterparty agree and represent that withholding tax will not appl=
y=20
and will not be deducted from payments it makes to Enron entities, and
(2) with respect to payments the counterparty will receive from Enron=20
entities, it is eligible to claim relief under the business profits article=
=20
of an applicable tax treaty and does not have a permanent establishment in=
=20
the paying Enron entity=01,s jurisdiction. =20


Please let me know if you have any questions, need any additional informati=
on=20
or would like me to forward our outside advisor=01,s memo on this subject t=
o you.

Best regards,
Susan
