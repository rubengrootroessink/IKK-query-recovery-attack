Remove all references to EnronOnline its unnecessary in this context - 
suffice to say you will be trading through all the normal Enron methods.

Subject: letter to reference credits

Attached is the letter that we intend to send to CFO/Treasurers of reference 
credits.  The section on EnronOnline was recommended by Sullivan and Cromwell 
and reviewed by Goddard, Dilworth and Simons.



There may be a few minor edits before it goes out.

Thanks
