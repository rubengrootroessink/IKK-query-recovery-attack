=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Please be advised that the NYMEX Board of Directors has approved a number o=
f=20
rule changes, which are summarized below, to incorporate the implementation=
=20
of enymexK. These rule changes, which have been filed with the CFTC and thu=
s=20
may become effective at any time, will be implemented upon the launch of=20
enymexK.

An unmarked version of these rule changes can be found on the Exchange=01,s=
=20
website.  A hard copy =01&black-line=018 version of the rule changes, which=
 shows=20
changes from the current rules, can be obtained by calling Kelly Ann Neeson=
=20
at (212) 299-2217 in the Exchange=01,s Legal Department.

The rule changes include the following areas: trading; position limits,=20
accountability and reporting; arbitration, Clearing Member obligations and =
a=20
summary disciplinary procedure for denial of access.

 Trading Rules
A number of changes are being made to existing rules to reflect the roll-ou=
t=20
of enymexK, such as expanding such rules to cover both NYMEX ACCESS7 and=20
enymexK.  For example, the NYMEX ACCESS7 error trade rule has been retitled=
=20
and revised to cover error trades occurring on either system.

EFP and EFS. Similarly, Rule 6.21B and 6.21C are the Exchange=01,s rules th=
at=20
respectively govern EFP and EFS transactions for futures contracts traded=
=20
only on NYMEX ACCESS7, i.e., electricity futures contracts.  These rules wi=
ll=20
now also govern enymexK EFP and EFS transactions.

Settlement Procedures. New NYMEX Rule 6.52E (=01&enymexK Settlement Price=
=20
Procedures=018) was modeled upon the current settlement price rule for=20
electricity contracts trading only on NYMEX ACCESS7. Thus, settlement price=
s=20
generally would be determined manually by the Settlement Committee, or if t=
he=20
Settlement Committee was not available, by Exchange staff using the same=20
criteria used by the applicable Settlement Committee.  However, one=20
difference is that the electricity settlement rule provides that no=20
settlement price shall be established that would be lower than the best bid=
=20
or higher than the best offer that: (a) was for at least twenty-five (25)=
=20
contracts, and (b) had been posted with the Exchange and remained available=
=20
for execution and unfilled for the final 30 minutes of trading.  By=20
comparison, new NYMEX Rule 6.52E contains more general language that would=
=20
allow the Exchange to customize for each enymexK contract the bids and offe=
rs=20
that would be protected in the settleme!
nt!
 process.

Position Limits, Accountability and Reporting.  With regard to the four=20
physical delivery enymexK crude oil contracts, the amendments to NYMEX Rule=
s=20
9.26 and 9.27 provide for position accountability in the back months and a=
=20
spot month limit of 2,000 contracts for each of these four contracts.  Also=
,=20
the Exchange=01,s current hedge exemption procedures will be made applicabl=
e to=20
the enymexK contracts. With regard to the cash-settled enymexK contracts, t=
he=20
rule amendments provide for position accountability across all contract=20
months. The amendments to Rule 9.34 establish a reporting level of 25=20
contracts for each enymexK contract, the same reporting level currently use=
d=20
for many other Exchange contracts. However, NYMEX staff also has initiated=
=20
discussions with CFTC staff regarding possible regulatory relief to exempt=
=20
market participants from these reporting requirements to the CFTC for the=
=20
cash-settled contracts.

Brokerage and Clearing Member Financial Responsibility. As to brokerage, ne=
w=20
Rule 9.04A (=01&enymexK Trading=018) permits brokerage to be done for enyme=
xK=20
products.  Section (C) of new Rule 9.04A clarifies that a Clearing Member=
=20
will be financially responsible for trades done for each account it carries=
,=20
even if there is a system malfunction.

 Arbitration Rules
The Exchange=01,s arbitration rules are being amended to reference Non-Memb=
er=20
enymexK Users and to provide that disputes between a Member and a Non-Membe=
r=20
enymexK User or between Non-Member enymexK Users would be subject to Exchan=
ge=20
arbitration on a permissive rather than on a mandatory basis.

 Summary Disciplinary Procedures
The sole disciplinary sanction that would be applicable to a Non-Member=20
enymexK User would be denial of further direct access to the system. =20
Consistent with this approach, new Exchange Rule 8.99A establishes a summar=
y=20
disciplinary procedure that would allow the Exchange to take action when=20
necessary on an expedited basis.

Please note that Exchange Members who are enymexK Users also will continue =
to=20
be subject to Exchange rules.

If you have any questions concerning these rules, please contact Christophe=
r=20
K. Bowen, Senior Vice President and General Counsel, NYMEX Legal Department=
,=20
at (212) 299-22200; or Brian Regan, Senior Associate General Counsel, NYMEX=
=20
Legal Department, at (212) 299-2207.
