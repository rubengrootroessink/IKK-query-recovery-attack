Mark,

The first time that you log into the web site you will see this message 
regarding certificates.  If you were to select continue than you should see 
an option to "accept forever" than you would not see this anymore.  
Nonetheless, this is a completely normal message from Netscape.





Please feel free to call if you have any further questions.

Regards,

Noel
