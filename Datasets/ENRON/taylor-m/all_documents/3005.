Further to Louise's suggestion:

On selecting "Create Price Limit Order" from the submission window, a link 
should appear titled "How Price Limit Orders Work". Suggest a location 
immediately below the bar containing the "Create Submission" and "Create 
Price Limit Order" buttons.

When this link is pressed, a popup window should appear containing the 
following text:

Price Limit Orders allow you to place an offer to buy or sell at a price 
which is not currently available. If the price you specified becomes 
available on EnronOnline, the system will automatically try to fill your 
submission and a transaction may result.  Your submission may be filled 
partially or completely depending on the volume available. This submission 
will remain active until the earlier of (i) the expiration of the hours and 
minutes you specify in your submission, (ii) Your cancellation (by 
highlighting the submision and pressing the cancel button on the main 
screen), or (iii) the end of the day. The submission  will not be withdrawn 
by your logout. Price limit orders are processed automatically by price and 
then by timestamp. Therefore, if other price limit orders for the same price 
have been submitted before yours, then they will be filled before your 
submission is filled. This can result in other transactions completing at the 
same price as your price limit order, while your price limit order does not 
complete.

How do you want us to handle the price limit order submission text?  See 
Mark's e-mail below.  I believe in the meeting this afternoon we talked about 
reducing the amount of text in the submission screen and creating a link to a 
separate section for the remainder of the information.

Dave - my comments are below in red.  I'm assuming that "end of the day" is 
the end of the trading day, but this seems a bit ambiguous since the trader 
in Japan may be thinking about a different "day" than the trader in London, 
etc.  Will the orders be cancelled if our trader removes a product during the 
day and then reactivates it?

Mark,

Further to our conversation today; How is this?

You have offered a price limit order for aaa mmbtus of yyyyy at a price of 
xxx. If the price you specified becomes available on EnronOnline, the system 
will automatically try to fill your submission and a transaction may result.  
Your submission may be filled partially or completely depending on the volume 
available. This submission will remain active until for the earlier of (i) xx 
hours and yy minutes from your submission, or  (ii) until you cancel it (by 
highlighting it and pressing the cancel button on the main screen), or (iii) 
the end of the day. The submission  will not be withdrawn by your logout. 
Price limit orders are processed by price and then by timestamp. Therefore, 
if other price limit orders for the same price have been submitted before 
yours, then they will be filled before your submission is filled. This can 
result in other transactions completing at the same price as your price limit 
order, while your price limit order does not complete.
