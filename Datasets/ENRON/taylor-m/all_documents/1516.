Please note in 1: It is not present in the English ETA.

Mario: Please check the U.S. ETA to see if there is an arbitration clause 
there.

Thanks,

Revising the Electronic Auction Transactions Agreement we noticed there is an 
arbitration clause (6e).

2 issues about that clause were raised:

1. It is not present in the English ATA. Should it be mentioned in both, 
neither or maintained the way they are?
2. Are there arbitrators with 8 years professional experience in the Internet 
Auctions Market?

Thanks,

Mario
