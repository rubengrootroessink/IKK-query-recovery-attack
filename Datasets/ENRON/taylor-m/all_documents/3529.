I need your help clarifying a few points. My thoughts are as follows:

ISDA
1 ISDAs should not number more than say 3 in the next year. There just are=
=20
not that many big players down here and the product is still very new to th=
e=20
market.
2 If yall believe Andrea needs more training I think this is great, but I=
=20
have to get through 4th quarter 1st. Jan Feb is slow here and she can come =
up=20
then.
Probably not a bad idea to commercially cross train Fabian Valle as well to=
=20
set up a back up.
3 It does not make sense to fly people all around the world to negotiate=20
ISDAs until there is a market that will support that volume of business.
4 I would propose that Andrea handle the local customer legal relationship=
=20
and closely coordinate with your Houston team to introduce, discuss and=20
finally if applicable negotiate these limited first documents if any.=20
5 It could be understood that a Houston attorney would be present in all=20
discussions via conference call
6 Andrea as she is ramping up in her training would act as the local point =
of=20
contact and communicator without conflicting with US law interpretation
=20
 Physical Swap Agreement =20
1 I am under the impression we had agreed to work with the physical swap=20
agreement, short form, ominbus agreement you provided the other day.
2 This would be for stand alone 1yr or less transactions that arise as we g=
o=20
forward.
3 This is a good bridge to get people to start doing simple structures to=
=20
understand the need to go to the next level of documentation
4 We have two transactional needs
 The random swap that is being discussed and needs a document to demonstrat=
e=20
the actual commercial agreement. Maybe 5 per year.
 If we get the EOL financial product sorted out with regards to local or NA=
=20
as the vehicle then for short term simple swaps
5 Either we are looking for a bridge to get us to the next level and ensure=
=20
that the documentation process is not hindering market growth     =20

Let me know if we can work with your group under this understanding to=20
facilitate the first deals in this market. We should constantly review the=
=20
markets growth and adjust our documentation  as it is needed as we go forwa=
rd=20
both in terms of EOL and the financial document.

Regards

MFG

Mike,

FYI. I spoke with Brent this morning to let him know that you had asked me =
to=20
accompany the commercial team in the preliminary discussions of how the ISD=
A=20
form works, as well as to request reading material on the subject.  He=20
explained that he and Mark were both of the opinion that since the ISDA for=
m=20
is a document designed to work under US law, they were not comfortable with=
=20
me explaining the document to counterparties without further training on th=
e=20
document itself, and gaining experience on Enron=01,s policy as it relates =
to=20
certain modifications to the document.  He suggested I should spend at leas=
t=20
two weeks in Houston to train with the group and the document in order to b=
e=20
minimally prepared to instruct counterparties on how the document works.  A=
s=20
far as the "omnibus" form is concerned, and contrary to what we thought,=20
Mark's intent during our last visit was apparently to approve use of a=20
document of the sort only for execution by a special purpose Argentine=20
derivative company and not by ENA, which would continue to execute ISDA=20
forms.  If the idea is to have a short form cross-border master agreement=
=20
between ENA and Argentine counterparties then ENA legal would have to draft=
 a=20
document which would take some time to create.  Lets discuss when you get a=
=20
chance. Thanks.

Andrea
