I am sure that New York requires that we submit your bar number so that you 
can get CLE credits.  Maybe you could call the New York CLE Committee 
(212/428-2105) to obtain your bar number-they will not give that to someone 
other than yourself.  I am getting responses from the other attorneys 
licensed in New York to give me their NY bar numbers--so they exist and maybe 
you just need to call NY to find out why you do not have your bar number.

Are you sure about this?  I didn't know I had a NY bar number.

We will need to obtain from you each of your bar numbers for the State of New 
York in order to obtain CLE credits on your behalf for attending the Enron 
Law Conference.  (Tami, there are two names on the second page of the New 
York sign-up sheet that I could not read-maybe you could send this message on 
to those two people if you can read the names).  Thanks.  Brenda McAfee
