Sara and Marcus:

Attached below please find subuser passwords for DynegyDirect so that each of 
you can review relevant products before we let the traders loose.  Sara, Greg 
Whalley and Andy Zipper just called me and are very anxious to get sign off 
to trade financial products.  Marcus, Wade Hicks called me and is anxious to 
trade LPG products.  We have a financial contract in place with Dynegy which 
will govern financial transactions, so it's just a matter of approving the 
products.  However, we do not have a liquids contract in place so you, 
Marcus, need to sign off on the Dynegydirect on-line terms and conditions 
that I sent you before we can commence trading.

If you have trouble logging on, give Sheri Thomas a call -- she has already 
logged on to use the system.  I believe you are going to need to download 
some software to use the system.

Please let me know AS SOON as you have completed your review so that we can 
set up trading.

Regards,

Leslie

Sheri:

As I mentioned in my voice mail, in addition to the subusers requested the 
other day, please set Sara Shackleton up so that she can read only all of the 
product groups -- she'll need to review the financial products.

Additionally, please set Marcus Nettelton  up for read only rights for 
Natural Gas Liquids.

Thanks,

Leslie
