Thanks again!  This week I used your suggestion for moving that banner
that covers the toolbar on Juno Web.  It worked!  That means that I can
now access the on-line addresses that appear in Juno E-mail messages and
print them if I wish.  That is a BIG plus!

I made some more progress with the printer too.  It was not printing well
the reports from Quicken.  Last night I was able to discover that I had
to change the printer setting on Quicken because it was still looking for
the old printer!  Word found the new printer by itself so I erroneously
assumed Quicken would too.  I'm sure all of this is "old hat" to you, but
for me it is not and it is exciting when I have success.

I have my Lilliput Lane village set up on the hi fi in the family room
now.  I really like having them arranged like a village now that I have
enough to do that.

I wonder if your paper whites are blooming yet.  Yes, people do grow them
outside.  Around here they are some of the first things that come up on
the spring.  When yours do bloom you may want to put them right outside
the window where you can see them but not be overcome by the fragrance!

Dad had 111 people in church last Sunday!  He is very enthusiastic about
what is happening there.

Sharon leaves for Antarctica tomorrow.  Mrs. Ludwig is going to be there
with Tim and Elena next Monday and Tuesday and take Elena home with her
on Wednesday for the rest of the week. I'm going on the 21st to stay with
them for a week, returning the 28th.

Love, Mother
