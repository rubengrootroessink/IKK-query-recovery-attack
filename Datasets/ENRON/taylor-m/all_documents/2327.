Hi Travis,

 I work with Steve Borgman, and we met at your offices in a meeting
with Dave Forster concerning Enron Online.  In studying the material we
received from Dave, we noticed that a company called Agency.com delivered a
project overview for Enron Online in about June, 1999.  Please confirm: (1)
Agency.com assigned any rights they may have to Enron Corp; (2) there were
no non-confidential disclosures outside of Enron or any discussions with any
potential customers or trading partners before the release of brochures in
October, 1999; and (3) any confidential disclosures are covered by a written
confidentiality agreement.  The Agency.com paper states that after the test
phase, the system would be released to a select set of internal and external
users for three weeks to ensure the system worked properly.  What is the
earliest these external users may have been contacted?  Would traders have
known about Enron Online last summer, and could a trader have discussed its
concepts with someone outside Enron?

 As you know, we have one year in the U.S.A. to file a patent
application after public use, public disclosure, or offer to sell.  Is there
any possibility that a disclosure of the concept for Enron Online could have
been disclosed nearly one year ago?

 Please telephone Steve Borgman or me.  Thanks.

Steve
