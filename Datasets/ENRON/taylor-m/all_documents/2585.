Michael + Paul-

Thought you might be interested in Alfred as a possible contact for insights 
on regulatory activities.  I'll ask Richard Sage to record him as a contact 
on our sheet.

Esther-

Please action somebody to follow thru on the cost saving opportunity (clear 
all NYMEX energy trades).  Jeff Shankman is the logical port of call in 
Houston to run this through.  Please advise me of the findings and 
conclusions.

Eric,

I want to thank you again for returning my call.

To summarize, I received a memo from Tom McKeever concerning individuals in
the organization who have been identified as key or secondary role in
certain function areas. I noticed that there is no US contact on the list.
I would have no problem in you adding my name to the list since I run the
Regulatory Firm of MG London Inc. USA a registered FCM and CTA.

Note: We can clear all Enron's NYMEX energy trades. It is my understanding
that you presently clear through ten
              different brokers. Maybe we can save some $$$$.  Call me if
you have any interest.  212 715 5845.

regards,
