_______________________________________________ 
FASB GROUP RULING MAY HIT EQUITY BUSINESS.  
The Emerging Issues Task Force at the Financial Accounting 
Standards Board has issued a new consensus decision regarding 
companies entering into derivatives transactions on their own 
equity. Some marketers argues the decision will slash this sort 
of business, but others argue the ruling will have little effect on 
their flow. 

FRENCH READY CROSS-MARKET NETTING LAW. 
France is set to become the first country to recognize close-out 
across derivatives, repos, and stock lending. If the legislation 
passes, banks will be allowed to more efficiently use their credit 
lines. 

DYNEGY PLANS WEATHER SPLASH.  
U.S. energy company Dynegy has made its first weather 
derivatives trades, and is planning to grow a healthy-sized 
group over about the next year.

INDUSTRY SPECULATES ON J.P. MORGAN CHASE; INSIDERS NOT CONCERNED. 
Market officials are speculating about how J.P. Morgan 
Chase will shape up, but pros at the firms don't seem 
especially concerned. While recruiters report seeing some 
business as a result of the merger announcement, their 
doors are hardly being beaten down.
