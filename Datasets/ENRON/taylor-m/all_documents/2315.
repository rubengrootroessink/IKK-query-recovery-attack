Dear Amazon Customer, 

A  little bird told us you just placed your first order at  Amazon.com.  
(Actually it was an ultrasecure, heavily guarded computer  system--but  the 
bird sounds friendlier.) At any rate, I'd like to take  this  opportunity to 
welcome you to Amazon.com and introduce you to  some  fun, free services 
every Amazon shopper should know about.

First off, sign  up for Delivers. Our expert editors will send you  
information-packed  e-mails about the topics that interest you most. Choose  
from  over 100 subjects--from DVD New Releases and Mystery  Books  to Bargain 
Music and Children's Software.

Next, are there authors you adore, musicians you admire,  actors  or 
directors you absolutely love? Then sign up for Amazon.com  Alerts. We'll 
send you an e-mail to let you know  when  a new release from that person 
first becomes  available.

Last order of business--send  an e-Card. It's a fun way to keep in touch 
with  friends.  Our wacky e-Card creative team has come up with clever  
greetings  for every occasion under the sun. When they run out of  holidays,  
they create their own--such as Bad Hair Day.

That's  it. Thanks again for shopping at Amazon.com. We hope you'll  stop  in 
again soon and put these special services to work for  you.  

  Sincerely,

Jennifer  Cast 
General Manager and Avid Amazon Shopper
