Mark,

I agree, particularly with respect to countries other than the U.S. where
the law is much murkier.  Bob will be working on this issue.

As you know, Clinton should sign, over the next couple of days, legislation
on electronic signatures.  There is a big need to standardize the approach
with respect to e-signatures on trading contracts and maybe confirmations.
I think this is an area that ISDA could provide leadership and possibly
make money through a protocol.  Let me know what you think.
