An update note from Ellen Chadick with contact info on which hospital Bobby 
is in.

All

weekend. 
He was part of a pack of riders, on the feeder.? A car came off the fwy, 
plowed into 6 of them.? One was killed.? Bobby is in Neuro Intensive Care, 
Ben Taub.? Both ankles crushed, punctured lung, crushed vertebrae, no 
paralysis tho.? 10 hours of surgery.? Keep him in your thoughts and prayers.

Please pass the word to anyone I've missed. 
Ellen 
(Thanks, Saym, for letting me know.)?

Got a brief update.? Bobby has some crushed vertebrae in his lower spine.? 
There doesn't appear to be any paralysis which is good.? His right ankle was 
shattered and his left ankle was pretty bad too.? Both lungs were crushed.? 
His surgery yesterday was spine and ankle related I think.? Ten hours worth.? 
He was not life flighted, but Tim and Barbara were.? Tim's right leg is 
shattered/crushed, his pelvis is broken and his collar bone may be broken.? 
Tim has more surgery today.? Don't have any news on Barbara since I don't 
know her.? They were riding on the 290 feeder road eastbound, very near the 
end of the ride.? A large pick up style truck apparently exited the freeway 
and hit them all from behind.? The guy I talked with was going to the 
hospitals this afternoon and was going to call me later with more.? Yes, 
Bobby on Saturday was himself somewhat - he apparently was asking about his 
bike and water bottles!!!!? I'm sure he's thinking he'll go running this 
weekend at the park!
