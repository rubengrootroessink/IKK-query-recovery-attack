Brenda, for future transactions wherein swaps are involved, please see that 
extra copies of executed swaps are made at closing so that copies may be 
immediately distributed to the applicable confirmation desks.  Since this 
aspect of the structured finance transactions include "trading" transactions, 
the confirmation desks need the paperwork immediately for their reference and 
audit trails and to avoid confusion with deal tickets etc.  Please forward  
this memo to the other paralegals and attorneys in your group.  For your 
reference, at this time the distribution of executed copies should be 
provided as follows depending upon the nature of the swaps:

Laurel Adams:  Interest Rate Swaps

Larry Joe Hunter and Bob Bowen:  Gas Commodity Swaps

Derek Bailey:  Crude Oil Swaps

Melissa Murphy:  Power Swaps

Dianne Seib:  Canada Swaps

Swap Trading Attorney:  as applicable to the attorney who assisted

Mary,

We do not yet have execution copies of the documents.  I am expecting them 
this week.  I will send copies of the swaps as soon as I receive them.

Thanks,

As to the initial closing into the Brazos partnership of Preston 1 and 
Crescendo, legal drafted the interest rate swaps.

Brenda, may Laurel and I get executed copies of the interest rate swaps, and 
I need the rest of the swap docs too, as well as copies to Larry Joe Hunter, 
all as previously requested.  Mary

Laurel, I do not have executed versions.  I did draft the swaps and they were 
signed at closing, but Global Finance Legal is in charge of distribution of 
executed docs.  To the extent it is helpful here are the final versions that 
I sent to closing.  If I can be of further help, please call.

Mary,

It was my understanding (from Tim Proffitt) that the legal department drafted 
all of the documents related to Brazos.  Does this include the interest rate 
swaps?  Originally you had sent me to Brenda Funk to get copies of the 
confirms for my records, but I have not heard anything from her at all.  
Could you please forward to me a copy of the documents, even if it has only 
been signed off on by one party?  I would like to review them and send them 
on to our file room.  

IF LEGAL HAS NOT DRAFTED THE INTEREST RATE SWAP CONFIRMS, PLEASE LET ME KNOW 
RIGHT AWAY, SO THAT I CAN PREPARE THESE DOCUMENTS!!

Thank you.
