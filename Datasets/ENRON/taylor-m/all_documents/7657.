This afternoon I talked to Anne-Marie Miser, the broker at Natsource who 
handled this swap.  While our ticket/booking/confirmation indicated we bought 
the swap, Ann-Marie said she was 100 percent positive we actually sold the 
swap.  She said that we actually sold two swaps at the same time at the same 
price -- one to Connectiv/Delmarva and the other to Duke.

Ann Marie said she was so positive on who was the seller and who was the 
buyer because everything was on tape.  I asked her to forward me the relevant 
tapes, and she did so a few minutes ago.  The key tape is attached.  Just 
press on it to hear Ann-Marie and, I believe, Dick Jenkins and Al Gallo of 
Connectiv/Delmarva.  To my untrained ears, the tape does not sound good.  Let 
me know your thoughts.
