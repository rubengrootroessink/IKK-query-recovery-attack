These are the amounts to be inserted in the confirmation for the Put Option.  
Please call with any questions.  
The comments to the Schedule that I forwarded to you are from the Enron Corp. 
lawyer, Clement Abrams  that must approve the documents.  Since it is not an 
ENA document, Mark said he would defer to Clement Abrams on the waiver issue 
and jurisdiction issue.
