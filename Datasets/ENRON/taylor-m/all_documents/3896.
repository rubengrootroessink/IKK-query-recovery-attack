Mark:

Attached is an agreement I've been trying to finalize with Puget Sound for 
literally months.  I'd like to talk to you about it briefly before we 
finalize.  So, please call me after you have had a chance to take a quick 
look at this very short agreement.

Carol was working on this before she took leave, and I'd hate for it not to 
get finalized before I take my leave.

Thanks,

Leslie
