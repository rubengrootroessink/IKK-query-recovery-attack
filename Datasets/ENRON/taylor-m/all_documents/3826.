Janette,

Mark announced in our staff meeting that the following attorneys will be 
joining the SWAP Group, effective immediately.  Although, they may not join 
us physically until January 2001 they need to have access to the following 
applications immediately, as projects  will be delegated to them.  Please 
note that nothing has been discussed about their respective assistants, but I 
would assume that they will need the same accesses as their attorney in order 
to support them efficiently.

Since the transfers seem to get complicated, it may be a good idea for the 
floor techs to talk.  The floor tech for 3AC 19th floor is Lyndel Romero.

Please don't hesitate to contact me at X57373 if you need further information.
