Mark,

I attach Cadwalader's memorandum in its final version.  This is the product 
of a number of discussions/comments between myself and David Mitchell.  It 
has been written on the basis that trading is carried on outside the US; 
obviously, a different memorandum would be required in relation of trading 
carried on by ECT from Houston.

Look forward to seeing you on Wednesday, and of course at the Conference!

Justin
