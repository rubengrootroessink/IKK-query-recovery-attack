Mark

I have attached a draft policy authorisation request to Skilling / Buy, in 
connection with the various "orphan" positions that exist in the firm but 
which do not necessarily fall into a proper risk management framework.

I would be grateful for your views on the legal implications of this activity 
as outlined, or at least how it ought to be structured to avoid legal "pain" ?

Regards
David
