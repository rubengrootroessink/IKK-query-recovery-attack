Cynthia asked me to forward Chairman Ewing's substitute bill which is 
attached.  There are two changes that present a problem for us: 1. metals 
have been taken out and 2. rulemaking authority for manipulation has been put 
in.  Please pay close attention to pages 38 and 39, specifically 38(2)(c).  
(The good news is that we have been told by staff that it could have been 
worse!)

Please also note that the House subcommittee mark-up is tomorrow followed by 
the full committee mark-up on Tuesday.  The Senate will then act more quickly 
than we anticipated: mark-up is scheduled for next Thursday.  We are in the 
process of securing meetings with key Senate staff for tomorrow.
