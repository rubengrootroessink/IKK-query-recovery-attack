Subject: Lost Credit Card


WHAT TO DO IF YOU LOSE YOUR PURSE OR WALLET: We've all heard horror stories
about fraud that's committed using your name, address, SS#, credit, etc.

Unfortunately I have firsthand knowledge, because my wallet was stolen last
month and within a week the thieve(s) ordered an expensive monthly cell
phone package, applied for a VISA credit card, had a credit line approved to

buy a Gateway computer, received a PIN number from DMV to change my driving
record information online, and more.

But here's some critical information to limit the damage in case this
happens to you or someone you know.

As everyone always advises, cancel your credit cards immediately, but the
key is having the toll free numbers and your card numbers handy so you know
who to call.  Keep those where you can find them easily (having to
hunt for them is additional stress you WON'T need at that point!).

File a police report immediately in the jurisdiction where it was stolen,
this proves to credit providers you were diligent, and is a first step
toward an investigation (if there ever is one).

But here's what is perhaps most important:

Call the three national credit reporting organizations immediately to place
a fraud alert on your name and SS#.  I had never heard of doing that until
advised by a bank that called to tell me an application for credit
was made over the Internet in my name.  The alert means any company that
checks your credit knows your information was stolen and they have to
contact you by phone to authorize new credit.

By the time I was advised to do this - almost 2 weeks after the theft all
the damage had been done (there are records of all the credit checks
initiated by the thieves' purchases, none of which I knew about before
placing the alert).  Since then, no additional damage has been done, and the

thieves threw my wallet away this weekend (someone turned it in). It seems
to have stopped them in their tracks.  The numbers are:

Equifax: 1-800 525-6285
Experian (formerly TRW): 1-800-301-7195
Trans Union:  1-800-680-7289
Social Security Administration also has a fraud line at 1-800-269-0271
