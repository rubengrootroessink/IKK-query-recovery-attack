Mark,

As a follow up to our conversation of the phone today, 
I have a question for clarification.
I also have an additional question.

Clarification:   Are we clear that the New Co. will be in place by July 1?
            In addition, are we clear that we will know the name of New Co. 
by Shelley's May 31 (next Wed.) 
            meeting with FERC?  She is meeting with FERC to explain what we 
are going to do.

Additional Question:  Can we make the name change in the Password Agreement 
and ETA by next Wed?
            We would like this change so we can do a demonstration for the 
FERC and have the
            name of the appropriate company pop up.

Thanks for your attention. 

Frazier
