Paul

Does your policies on Chinese Walls apply in Houston as well? The reason for 
my query is that a New York recruiter asked me some details about a credit 
analyst position that would be based in Houston? For instance would it be 
possible for the successful candidate to lever of the knowledge of Houston 
Credit and other origination groups?

Regards

Tomas
