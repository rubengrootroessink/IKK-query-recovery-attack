Dave,

Here are final approved versions of the following:

EnBank Storage Services General Terms and Conditions (these will apply for 
the purposes of both online and offline execution)
One page "Agreement" to be completed and signed by the Customer (and signed 
by Enron), but  ONLY where execution is offline.  [In the case of online 
execution, the Customer will only be required to "click" its acceptance of 
the General Terms and Conditions]

These have been approved internally (i.e. by me, Jonathan, credit and tax).

Regards

Justin
