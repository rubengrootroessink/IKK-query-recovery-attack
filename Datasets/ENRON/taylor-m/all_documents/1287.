As Enron's broadband services business grows, we will continue to position 
the company to take advantage of the significant opportunities in this market 
and meet the needs of our global customers.  With that in mind, we've made a 
number of changes within the Office of the Chairman of Enron Broadband 
Services aimed at providing a better focus on the key objectives of the 
organization.  

Joe Hirko and Ken Rice, previously co-CEOs of Enron Broadband Services, will 
continue to jointly manage the strategic direction of the company.  Joe will 
continue as CEO and will be responsible for the primary executive management 
of EBS as well as network build-out, BOS development, cross-market 
capabilities and staff functions.  Ken will assume the role of chief 
commercial officer and will be responsible for developing the commercial 
functions of the organization.
  
In addition, Kevin Hannon has been named chief operating officer and will be 
responsible for the day-to-day operations of EBS.  Kevin was most recently 
CEO of Global Risk Management and, prior to that position, he was president 
and COO of Enron North America, where he has been instrumental in developing 
Enron's trading and risk management business in gas, electricity and other 
emerging markets.  Greg Whalley, president and COO of ENA, will again assume 
his responsibilities for Global Risk Management.

Please join us in congratulating Joe, Ken, Kevin and Greg in their new roles.
