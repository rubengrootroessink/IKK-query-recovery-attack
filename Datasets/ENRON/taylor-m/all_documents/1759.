It would be great if Mark could join us.  How long are you going to be in
town.  If you are only going to be here that night, maybe it would be better
to just sit around and chat.  It really doesn't matter to me.

Thanks for your note - I'll keep those items in mind.  It seems pretty
clear to me that the Pres. has something of a bricks and mortar agenda and
some gentle nudges towards a more academic path may be needed.   I asked
Mark Kopinski, who is also coming to the planning meeting, if he wanted to
join us for dinner so I've sent him a note asking if he wants to go to the
play or not - I'll let you know what he says - I have mixed feelings since
I'd like to see the play but would regret the time we could have spent
chatting.
