Bryan - 

In fact, in order to get this first list of 200 or so on the 
non-transactional web page, we conducted only a very brief legal review in 
Houston - th full review takes much longer since it involves input from a 
variety of people.

I suggest choosing the reference credits for online trading from the already 
approved reference credits which appear on EnronCredit.com.  My recollection 
is that there currently is not a separate approval process from either a 
credit or legal perspective.  Let's review everything for EOL prior to the 
states getting to the office on Monday and get an email out with the list of 
reference credits.

New reference entities - as with any other new Products, should be submitted 
to the Product Control Group (Amita Gosalia).

The PCG will then be responsible for the text of the new Products and 
obtaining the necessary approvals.

However, in accordance with our discussions with Bryan, EnronOnline will be 
limited to 20 reference entities until after we have settled on the credit 
derivatives update/volume requirements, which may or may not feed into a 
phase 2 development of the EnronOnline site.

Paul:

Will there be a different process for approving names as references on 
EnronCredit.com (non web-trading) and EOL?

Furthermore, you, Edmund, Tomas  and I need to establish a process fro 
regular and smooth approval of new reference names, a checklist if you will.

Meet this afternoon, before you depart?
My diary is open
