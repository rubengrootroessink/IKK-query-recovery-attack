Mark;

People in SP are asking me about the implementation of the EOL business in 
Brazil.  Have you forwarded a copy of the questionnaire to Bertone ?  If not, 
please forward it to me asap.

Thanks,

Sami

The load balancing is with Debora for signature. She will send a copy for our 
files. It's done.
Mark will send the questionnaire to me and I will interface with Pinheiro 
Neto.

Andrea;

With respect to the Load Balancing Agreement, the status has not changed 
during the past 6-8 weeks.  Where is the agreement and/or who should sign it ?

On EOL, will Mark Taylor contact Pinheiro Neto directly ?

Thanks,

Sami

Subject: deal list

Attached is the updated deal list . I talked to Fernando Bacelar about the 
upcoming outsourcing deals. He will send the LOIs for my review during the 
course of this week. I did not include them in the deal list because I still 
don't know the specifics. To be included next week.
