I spoke to Mark Taylor today and here's what he said about quoting names on 
Mission:

1. It is generally more liberal to quote off-line than online.
2. It is very easy to quote when we are showing one price for a basket of 
names. As long as all names are equally divided. In fact legal team would 
have no objection if there are 10-15 names in the group and they are all 
equally weighted in exoposure.
3. As far as the specific list is concerned, he will get back with us with 
coments shortly.

Ted:
Please let me know who will be replacing you on this deal once you rotate (if 
you are rotating)
Also, do you have any indications on the weightage of each counter-party in 
the list.

Thanks and Regards
Moazzam
