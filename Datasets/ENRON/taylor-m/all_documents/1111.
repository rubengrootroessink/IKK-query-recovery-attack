We are experiencing an high level of cusotmers wishing to speak to a lawyer 
on the EnronOnline agreements and bearing in mind you have other jobs we need 
to have someone permanently manning the phone for all the industrials.  Could 
you get another Edmund type working for you who mans the phones permanently 
so we can get people on the system immediately.

Thanks

Louise
