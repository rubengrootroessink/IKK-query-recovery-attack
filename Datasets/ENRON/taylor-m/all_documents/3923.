Mark, David

We have recently blended the Weather GTC to combine Swaps and Options, as 
well as Average Temp + HDD trades.

Please would you let me know whether you approve

Thanks.
Justin

Justin

I have made those two changes (as attached).

Can I then go ahead and use the long decsriptions and GTCs as attached ?

Thanks

Arfan,

in the definition of Strike Level, change "transaction" to "Transaction"
in the definitions of Option Buyer and Option Seller, leave the text as it 
stood, i.e. without the latest amendments as currently shown

Amita has just told me that their is a global effort to standardise the GTCs 
for weather trading worldwide, therefore you will need to consult David 
Minns  and Mark Taylor before signing off on any GTCs.

Thanks

OK, I think we are nearly there..... here are the amended documents. I had a 
double check with the old docs and found that we needed to have a defenition 
for data source (especially in the case of the UK Met offices website - there 
are 2 data sets for max and min!!!). This has been added and the AVT 
defenition changed.

In the product long descriptions for other European locations: "The Data 
Source shall be obtained from the relevant reporting service" (might have to 
get better wording from Justin for this).

Cheers

Catherine
