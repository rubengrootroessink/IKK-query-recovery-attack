Mark,

Following the memorandum I sent you yesterday dealing with the specific legal 
issues affecting the structure of Enron's website, I now attach the UK 
Executive Summary & General Issues prepared by Clifford Chance.  This is a 
summary of the more general issues that arise in the context of internet 
trading.

Justin
