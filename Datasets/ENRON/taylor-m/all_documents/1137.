I am not sure if Christian got back with you on the possible timing for our 
legal seminar in Portland but Tim Belden is out until Friday and Christian is 
out until Monday.  Christian indicated to me that he was going to call you on 
Monday with a definitive date.  

The web site is now available outside the firewall.  The location is 
http://www.enronwest.com    Be aware that this is currently only a template 
site. 

Let me know if you need any additional information.

Regards,
Mike
