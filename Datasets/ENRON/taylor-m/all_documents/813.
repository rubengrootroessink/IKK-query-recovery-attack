Mark - given Edmund's return to the office this week...and my absence (on 
vacation) , I'd be grateful if you could e-mail Edmund as well on EOL matters.

Thanks

Justin

The Newsticker information will appear in both the House and Garden at the 
current time - we are unable to distinguish between the two at this time.
Therefore, it would be available to all companies accessing our website, 
whether they are registered users or not.

Dave,

It is important to ensure that, to the best of our knowledge, Newsticker 
Information is accurately stated, current and consistent with other 
information on the website and in the GTCs, Long Descriptions, User Guide, 
etc.

Nonetheless, we will want to be able to rely on the Legal & Privacy 
Statement, since this contains an exclusion of liability for the timeliness 
and accuracy of information on the website (para 4) and an exclusion of any 
warranties as to the completeness and accuracy of information (para 3). 

A couple of questions:

Will Newsticker Information only be relevant and available to companies that 
are actually trading on-line? 
Where on the website will the "link" to Newsticker Information appear? {This 
is important for the purposes of the Legal & Privacy Statement}

Regards

Justin

Mark/Justin,

Obviously, we will need to have an appropriate examination of each data 
element, but do either of you foresee any complications with us providing 
information as per the attached via EnronOnline?

I am wondering particularly about any liability we may have in the event that 
the information which we provide is late or wrong.

Comments?

Thanks,

Dave

Attached is a European spreadsheet which shows possible information items 
which we could carry on our news ticker. (industry-specific stuff like 
linepack).

It breaks down the items by product grouping.

If we want to proceed with putting this kind of info. on the ticker, we would 
have to acquire legal approval and buy-in from the people who would be 
responsible for updating the information.

What do you think? Should we proceed with putting this kind of stuff on the 
site? Note that at the current time, it would have to appear in Garden.
