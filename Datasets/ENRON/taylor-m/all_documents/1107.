Hello Mark, 
Please advise me on this matter and let me know if you want me to follow up 
with the customer or if you contact customer.  EOL customer is inquiring 
about if their Lawyers can modify or  make comments to the ETA. Thanks.

My manager had a question concerning the ETA's and if they can be modified
if our Lawyers have comments or changes that they would like to make.
Thanks
