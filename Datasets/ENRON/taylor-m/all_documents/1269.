I have reworked the outline to include new material and to update some of the 
information.  I would appreciate your comments.

I have added additional hypotheticals to the list.  In my experience, this 
program works with 6 hypotheticals soyou need to choose the 6 you think work 
best.  Please let me know, and I will prepare the packages
