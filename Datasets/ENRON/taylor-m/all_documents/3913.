SUMMARY

                    On November 8, 2000, the Division of Corporation
Finance and the Office of the Chief Accountant of the Securities and
Exchange Commission ("SEC") released a summary of selected SEC staff
interpretations of the rules governing the pooling-of-interests method
of accounting for business combinations (the "Guidance").  The Guidance
includes references to two White Papers recently published by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ("AICPA") that
summarize other SEC interpretations of the same rules.
