Curtis,

The TAGG IQ report we run daily compares our positions to our limits per the 
NYMEX.  It is imperative that this report is accurate at all times.  There is 
a significant amount of risk associated with violating our NYMEX limits, 
including disallowing Enron to trade futures.  This would be a very serious 
problem.   Our legal department receives this report daily to ensure we are 
complying with our limits.  

Please let me know what I need to do to get a resource to review the problem 
we are having.   Your proposed alternative solution will not work on a daily 
basis.  The TAGG IQ report includes many other commodities besides natural 
gas.  Your assistance is greatly appreciated.

Mike

The problem with your port calc's is there is no April futures price being 
loaded.  Speak with Veronica Arriaga about that.  The other is there is no 
Volatility curve loaded for NBSK.  Speak to Robert Richard about that.

The report is probably not accurate.  It was written long ago and we just do 
not have the resources at the moment to look at it.  The much better solution 
is to run an ERMS report that you have used in the past.  Dutch Quigley will 
be able to help you with that.  Dutch will only be able to help you with 
Natural Gas, if there are other commodities in question let me know.

Thanks,
Curtis

Curtis:

I need some help in the following areas. Do you think you could help me?

First, the following post ids for TAGG/METACALC Metaid #10472 are always 
erroring out. It doesn't matter what time of the day I run it. They are as 
follows:

622013
622012
576271
247701
216939
216946

Any information you could provide would be appreciated.

Secondly, I am not too sure that the TAGG IQ report that I send to Mark 
Taylor in Legal is working properly. I have no way of telling, however from 
my side. Do you know at all? Is this something you can advise? The report is 
under Report Group: Exchange Controls. The The Report name is Limits.IQR. The 
numbers are not changing from day-to-day. I would appreciate it if you could 
look into this.

Thanks for your time,
Tobin
