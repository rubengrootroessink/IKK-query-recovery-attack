SUMMARY

                    On March 14, 2001, an emergency regulation became 
effective that clarifies that sales plans and repurchase programs under SEC 
Rule 10b5-1 also provide an affirmative defense to insider trading liability 
under California law.  The emergency regulation will be effective for a 
period of 120 days.  At that time, the emergency regulation will lapse

unless the Commissioner of Corporations takes appropriate action to adopt a 
permanent regulation or the emergency regulation is readopted.
