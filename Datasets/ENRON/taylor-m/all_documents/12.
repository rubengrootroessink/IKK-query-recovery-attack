Mark,

Cynthia Scneider recommended I check with you on the ability of Chinese 
government-owned entities to enter into derivative contracts with Enron.  Has 
ECT done any research on China?  Please see the e-mail below for details on 
counterparty, size, term, etc.

Thanks,
Heather Mitchell

Cynthia,

The EI LNG Group is looking at providing LNG price risk management for China. 
Could you please confirm whether China National Oil Company (Corp.?) and 
China State Power Corp. are creditworthy counterparties?  Before Doug and I 
talk to the traders I want to see whether we would even be willing to sell 
LNG risk management to them.

The structure the group is most likely interested in is 500,000 MT to 
1,000,000 MT per year for five to 20 years (depending on what our traders are 
comfortable with).  I imagine the Chinese would be interested in a cap or 
collar, and not a fixed price.

What other info do you need for a quick estimate?

Thanks,
Heather
