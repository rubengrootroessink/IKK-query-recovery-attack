Hello Mr. Taylor:

I wasn't sure if your voice mail was working so I decided to e-mail you
regarding the TULA Conference in October.  Time is running short and Mr.
Suggs needs to get the TULA Papers approved, and I was wondering what the
status is on your papers.

Please feel free to e-mail me at WhiteS@EpEnergy.com or call me at
713-420-6796.

Thank you,

Susan White
