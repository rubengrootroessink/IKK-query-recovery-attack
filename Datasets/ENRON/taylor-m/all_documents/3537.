Folks -

Enron Asia Pacific lawyers and legal specialists need to look for positions 
elsewhere within Enron.  I am attaching the resumes of two lawyers (Bonnie 
Nelson and Bill Krenz) and a paralegal (Bill Brown) that are available now to 
take assignments in other Enron business units.  I would appreciate your 
consideration of these individuals for positions in your groups.  I would be 
happy to discuss them with you at your convenience.

One other lawyer (Yao Apasu) and a legal specialist (Tami Scrudder) are still 
working on some important pending matters.  I intend to forward their resumes 
when the timing of their availability becomes more clear.

Thank you,
Bruce
