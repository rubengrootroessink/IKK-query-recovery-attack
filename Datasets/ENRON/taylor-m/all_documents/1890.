Could you please be kind and start to have a look at these names. Ultramar 
are (BBB/Stable/A-2), Petro Canada are (BBB+/Stable/A-2) and Louis Dreyfus 
are (A-1+).

The annual report of Preem is attached (www.preem.com) and financial 
information on CEPSA can be found at 
http://www.cepsa.es/cepsa_ingles/10/1030_index.html. The web site of ERG is 
www.erg.it, but there seem to be no relevant information.

I will try to find out some information about the European entities tomorrow.

Regards

Tomas

Hope you had a good Easter mine was fairly quiet.

In response to your email on the 19 of April regarding names,
counter-parties and coverage; I have prepared the following:

In all cases the exposure would be o10 million for a period of 120 days,
starting from a date of our choosing.

PREEM AB is the parent company, our counter-party is PREEM PETROLEUM AB,
Sanhamngatan 51, SE-115, 90 Stockholm, Sweden.

ERG Spa is the name of the company ( I think it is the initials of the
original founder) and the counter-party whom we will be trading with is ERG
Petroli Spa, World Trade Center, Via De Marini, 1, 16149 Genoa, Italy.

CEPSA is Compania Espanola De Petroleos, S.A., Campo De Las Naciones, AVDA,
Del Partenon, 12, 28042, Madrid (Espana).

Ultramar Diamond Shamrock Corporation is the parent company, 6000 N.Loop,

  David,
  We think, we require additional information from you -
mostly of the
  following character:
  -what would be the notional amount of protection you would
like to receive
  (or sell) per name,
  -what would be the duration per name
  The data above can make the cases more realistic, though
alternatively we
  can come up with our assumptions.
  I would also appreciate if you could provide us with full
names for ERG Spa
  and CEPSA - so we could make a credit evaluation.

  Hope to hear from you soon.
  Have a nice Easter break!

  With best regards
  Konstantin

            Dear Ben,

            Thank you very much for attending the meeting
today. I hope
  you and your
            colleagues have found it useful.

            Following our agreement during the meeting,
please, find
  attached the term
            sheets for the markets you might be interested in.
Other
  countries term sheets
            are very similar to the attached one's with only
difference
  in the bankruptcy
            definitions.

            As far as Italy is concerned, we inferred from the
meeting
  that you just started
            the operation there, and are beginning to evaluate
and
  understand the
  counter-parties there. To jump over this laborious process,
  we propose to discuss
            the issue of complete credit desk management
outsourcing for
  this region.

             I also included another presentation, which goes
in more
  details on some
            aspects of credit trading.

            As we agreed at the meeting we will prepare the
sample cases
  for you, as an
            illustration on the practical usage of the
products. We will
  expect you to
            provide reference names you would be interested to
see in
  the cases.

            With best regards

            Konstantin Malinovski
