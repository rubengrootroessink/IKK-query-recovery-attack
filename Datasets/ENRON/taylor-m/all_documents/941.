I received a call from Martin Gajewski (612-984-3033) with Cargill Energy. He 
would like to make sure that the Master Agreement is the contract of 
resolution for terms and conditions of the product. He is specifically 
inquiring about paragraph 3F in the Electronic Trading Agreement. He would 
like a call back as soon as possible. Is it possible for you to contact him 
today?

Thanks,

Matt Motsinger
