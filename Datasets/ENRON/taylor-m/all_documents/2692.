Subject: OTC commodity derivative


We contacted the responsible officers of the BOK and confirmed that the BOK 
received 7 or 8 reports since April last year (when the rules changed) 
regarding OTC commodity derivative transactions and all of them were filed by 
Hyundai Oil Refinery in connection with oil derivatives.  It appears those 
reports were accepted by the BOK.  The review and processing of the reports 
would generally take 1 or 2 weeks.  Regards,
