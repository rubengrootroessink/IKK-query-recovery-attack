Louise,

No changes have been made to ETAs or PAs.  

In the case of National Power they requested an anodyne clarification of a 
clause in the ETA (one of the same points TXU required clarification - I had 
emailed Dave a copy of that letter). We are planning to send them a letter to 
that effect  (copy attached).  It does not constitute an amendment to the 
ETA.  As it hasn't yet been sent youself or Dave can veto it.

Thanks, Edmund.

Let's be clear there are no changes unless approved directly by myself or 
Dave Forster.

I notice Eastern are trading and I have approved no changes and Dave has been 
away since the issue was raised.  So how come they are on?
