Mark,

Thanks again for your help.  Rahil, my colleague, recently mentioned that 
there was some concern that we make sure a joint NDA did not violate any FERC 
related issues about ETS and Net Works working together on this.  It was 
suggested that I give Mark Taylor a call to verify that we are doing 
everything we can to maintain the integrity of ETS as a separate legal 
entity, since Net Works is a division of Wholesale Services.

Anyway, Rahil followed up with a call to Mark Taylor and I wanted to give you 
a heads up.

Thanks,
- Steve

Stephen -

Glad to be of assistance.  In order to ensure we prepare an accurate 
document, I need to have the complete name and address of CMS (or the 
appropriate entities).  Also, our intention is to put as the "transaction" 
the following:

"Enron and CMS are prepared to furnish each other with information in 
connection with the development and implementation of a pipeline portfolio 
management solution..."

Please let me know if this is acceptable or if we need to modify this generic 
description of the transaction.

Mark,

Thanks for agreeing to help prepare this NDA.  As we discussed on the phone, 
our team is now in a position to begin detailed negotiations with CMS for a 
systems solution project (CMS Energy - Panhandle Pipe Line Companies).  As a 
part of the negotiations we will need to disclose some detailed information 
about ETS systems.  

Steve Hotte (CIO of ETS) and our team agreed that we should to execute an NDA 
that covers both ENW and ETS and gave me Drew's name as their legal council.

The contact name at CMS should be:

Cynthia C. Albert
Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Information Systems
5444 Westheimer Road
Houston, TX 77210-4967

713-989-7334
tsmehta@cmsenergy.com

On the Enron side, I would use

David Berberian for ENW
Steve Hotte for ETS

for signatories.

I hope this is sufficient information to prepare one or two NDA's whichever 
is appropriate.

Sincerely,
Steve Abbanat
