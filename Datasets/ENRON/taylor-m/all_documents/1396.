I tried to get into the website tonight but was unable to do so.  Can you fax 
us copies of the portions we are supposed to be looking at?  I will be back 
in the office on Monday but will try the site again in the interim.  Thanks.

This is a follow up note concerning the disclaimer statement for the Western
Power internet page.  I would like to know how this is coming?  Has the 
outside
councel reviewed the site yet?  I would like some comments back in the next
couple of days if possible.
