Mark and Carol:  The bankruptcy bill is on the "quick list" for consideration 
in the 107th Congress.  ISDA and BMA are meeting in NY  February 8 to 
determine their strategy for considertation of this legislation.  I plan to 
attend the meeting.

I will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 31 and would like to sit down with 
you to ensure that our interests are properly represented.  We also need to 
have "wish list" of changes to the bankruptcy code that we can submit as part 
of this process.  Are you available on Wednesday afternoon?

Also, please let me know if there are others at Enron I should include in 
this discussion.

Thanks - Chris
