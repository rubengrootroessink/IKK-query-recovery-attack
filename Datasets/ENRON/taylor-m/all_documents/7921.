The payment is already scheduled (translation...I can't stop it).  Don't
worry, you'll get the money...I swear.  I pay all my US bills through the US
Postal electronic bill paying service.  It is actually a pretty cool
service.  They will do an electronic transfer or send a check to any company
and/or individual in the US.  I have used this service to pay all my bills
since I've left the US, and I have even used it to send my parents some
money.   I am the biggest fan of paying bills on-line now.  I wish I had
started doing it sooner.  I may never write a check again.

Jim,

I'm having a very busy day, but sometime in the next week, I'll call
atlantis
and ask if they have a non 1-800 # so that you can call them directly and
give them your credit card info.  In fact, if you would like to do that for
the deposit and ask them to credit me, don't send me a check in the mean
time.  If that is not convenient for you, please give me your address so
that
I can forward on the info I receive from Atlantis to you.
