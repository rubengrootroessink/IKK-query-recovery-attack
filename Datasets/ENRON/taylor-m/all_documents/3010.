Mark:

What is our policy about giving on arbitration.  This is a federal entity 
that has said they cannot agree to arbitration.  They have agreed to the 
language set forth in the document attached below.

Please advise.

Leslie

I know this will cause delays, but this agency does not have authority to 
enter into binding arbitration.  Apparently some agencies do have that 
authority.  I have attached 2 files.  One is with the changes highlighted and 
the other is a clean copy of what we would be willing to sign.  Please let me 
know what sort of timeframe I can expect on a response to this proposal.

Thanks - Kass Portra
