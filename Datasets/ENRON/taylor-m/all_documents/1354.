Dale:

At long last, attached please find the revised Index Product Long 
Descriptions (clean and red-line), as well as the new Index descriptions. 



Please note that Mike asked me to include a ZP26 Peak and Off-Peak Index.

 I have also included below revised language for the Financial Power Swap 
Product, which Mark Taylor should okay:

Financial Power Swap Product:

"A US Power Financial Swap Transaction with Enron North America Corp., under 
which the Seller 
pays a Floating Price and the Buyer pays the price submitted by Counterparty 
on the website 
(the Fixed Price) in each case in respect of the Notional Quantity per 
Determination Period.  Each 
calendar month during the term of the Transaction or the term of the 
Transaction if it is less than a month will be 
a Determination Period. The Notional 
Quantity per Determination Period shall be the volume for the relevant 
Determination Period 
(calculated using the volume submitted by Counterparty via EnronOnline). The 
Payment Date(s) 
will be 5 business days after the Floating Price is determinable. The 
Floating Price shall be the 
average of the Index for each day in the relevant Determination Period."

Let me know when you have some product examples for my review. 
I need to look at a full-blown example to make sure we've covered all the 
bases.
