I am pleased to announce a new large scale steel piece completed for the
show "Once Removed" at Socrates Sculpture Park in Long Island City, New
York.  Almost 8 tons of steel, over 500 pieces of Cor-ten steel
attached by nearly 4500 stainless steel bolts and measuring 23 feet in
length and 28 feet in width, this flexible structure slumps and slides
across the landscape.  A continuation of an exploration of structures
that have a role in their own making, it is a simple system whose final
form is only semi-determined.

The exhibition opens June 4th from 2 - 5pm and remains onview through
the summer.  See the attached website for directions and hours

Socrates Sculpture Park is a 4.5 acre, waterfront sculpture park located on 
the East River in Long Island City, Queens. Socrates Sculpture Park is one of 
the few places In New York City where large-scale, outdoor sculpture can be 
enjoyed by the public. Since its opening In the fall of 1986 the Park has 
presented a constantly changing selection of work by the most exciting 
artists working today. Sculptors from all regions of the United States, 
Europe and Central America have been joined by musicians, dancers, painters 
and filmmakers to create a multi-media modern art showcase. 

Socrates Sculpture Park is situated In Long Island City, Queens, where 
private homes, factories and warehouses co-exist in an unpretentious 
neighborhood with breathtaking views of the Manhattan skyline. Appropriately, 
the park is located on the border of the largest population of Greeks outside 
Athens.

History and Goals of Socrates Sculpture Park 

Socrates Sculpture Park Is a former illegal dumpsite leased from New York 
City's Department of Ports and Trade for $1 per year. The site required 
almost a year of work to clear and landscape before the first installation of 
sculpture was possible. Socrates Sculpture Park is the masterwork of the 
Athena Foundation, which was created In 1977 by the sculptor Mark di Suvero 
to encourage the arts, to expand the culture and to create a space for the 
harmonious interaction of people and art. 

After a year of clearing what was once an illegal garbage dump, the Park 
opened its first exhibition of contemporary, outdoor sculpture in 1986. Since 
that time, Socrates continues to revitalize the economic, social, 
educational, and cultural life of this community via activities that 
encourage creative interaction between artists, their art, and the community 
through visual arts and outreach programs. The Park's existence is based on 
the belief that reclamation, revitalization and creative expression are 
essential to the survival, humanity and improvement of our urban environment. 

At a ceremony on May 23,1993, Socrates officially became part of the NYC 
Dept. of Parks & Recreation. As the newest addition to Park land in over a 
decade SSP is the only NYC park dedicated solely to the creation & exhibition 
of contemporary sculpture. In 1995, Socrates was designated as one of sixty 
three "Great American Public Places," testimony to the fact that the Park is 
an exemplary model of the built environment. Although our new relationship 
with the City of NY guarantees our existence for years to come it does not 
provide support for our outreach programs for youth or community residents. 

Community Collaborations Initiative 

Since Its inception the Park has operated outreach programs for youth and 
neighborhood residents. In 1990 SSP founded the Education Department, 
offering a variety of innovative & alternative programs to some of NYC 
neediest youth from the local community, as well as off-site in NYC public 
schools. Many of our program target youth from high risk backgrounds. These 
workshops further the Park's goal to redefine the role of the art institution 
as a purveyor of alternative education in the schools, community and 
eventually society. 

Through our Community Collaborations Initiative, Socrates is able to design 
on a one-on-one basis special hands on art workshops. While many schools have 
lost funds for fine arts programs, Arts Education is now recognized as an 
essential part of healthy development and a rounded education.
