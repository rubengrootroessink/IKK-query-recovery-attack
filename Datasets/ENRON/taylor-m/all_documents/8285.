Hello Mark,

?

Thanks again for our impromptu meeting from last week.? Upon review of my=
=20
notes, I realized that I had promised you a bit more info on Beachfire to=
=20
facilitate your offer to =01&introduce us around=018 to some of your collea=
gues.?=20
Here=01,s the general overview, and the attached presentation gives a littl=
e=20
more flavor for our company and the software.

?

Most business transactions are governed by written agreements, and most=20
agreements require some level of negotiation.? As the total number of peopl=
e=20
working on both sides of a deal increases, multiple cycles of comments and=
=20
revisions to the contract cause significant difficulty and delay.? Beachfir=
e=01,
s software enables companies to reduce by up to 50% the time, effort, and=
=20
aggravation associated with executing most business agreements.

?

All parties to a deal, regardless of their location, can use Beachfire=01,s=
=20
software to simultaneously (or asynchronously) work on the same document vi=
a=20
the Internet.? Whoever is =01&driving=018 the deal creates the initial draf=
t and=20
designates who is allowed to comment on, edit, and approve the agreement.?=
=20
Beachfire=01,s software eliminates the problems and delays that occur when=
=20
multiple copies of a document are distributed to a group.? Since the softwa=
re=20
is based on negotiation =01&best practices,=018 it actually increases the=
=20
probability of a successful deal.

?

Anyone with Internet access can quickly begin using Beachfire=01,s software=
.?=20
There is no effort or expense required by IT staff to install or manage the=
=20
software.? In addition, the Beachfire solution is far more secure than=20
collaboration via email.

?

This is a very brief description of a powerful collaboration tool.?? I woul=
d=20
be happy to set up additional demonstrations of our software for anyone who=
=20
is interested in learning more.=20

Best regards,
