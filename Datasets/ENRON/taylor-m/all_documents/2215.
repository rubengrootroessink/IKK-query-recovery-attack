Cool and Yup to the lawyer - probably both of you if you can make it as we 
will revisit the regulatory issues in depth for the paperwork - can we set up 
Wed in NY?

Louise:

The S & C first draft of the Posting Agreement was fine as far as it went, 
but it was only a first draft and needs a rework before the meeting to make 
the best use of your time.  Mark and I plan to redraft it and recirculate it 
in the next couple of days -- I wouldnb't recommend you look at the current 
draft, because it doesn't really say anything other than what is already in 
the True Quote term sheet.

Do you need a lawyer with you in New York when you meet with S & C?
