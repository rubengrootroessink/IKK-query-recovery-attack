TAIWAN BANKS SET TO ENTER SWAP MARKET FOR CHEAP DOLLAR FUNDS.  
Taiwan-based banks are planning to exploit the ballooning interest rate 
differential between

Several banks are 
planning their first Hong Kong dollar-denominated issues, including 
Chinatrust Commercial 
Bank.

PLAYERS CHARGE INTO EURO FLATTENING TRADES.  
Several banks were seen putting on flattening trades in the euro swaps market 
last week.

sectors.

TAIWAN REGULATORY CHANGE GOOD FOR FOREIGN BANKS. 
Recent regulatory changes in Taiwan will likely be a boon for foreign banks
