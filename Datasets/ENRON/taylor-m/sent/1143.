Jeff and Mark,

Attached please find the comments that I wish to file with the Federal Trade 
Commission concerning EnronOnline for their upcoming B2B workshop this coming 
Thursday-Friday.  Please review and let me know whether you have any 
recommended changes.    Thanks for your assistance.

Regards,
Lara
