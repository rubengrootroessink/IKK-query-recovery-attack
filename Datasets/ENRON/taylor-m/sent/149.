Les and I plan to go to Branson, Mo to meet with Les' Dad and StepMom for his 
birthday on March 5th.  I'll need to take off March 5th and March 8th.  Chris 
Kuenning will be able to sit at my desk for those two day.  Is this o.k. with 
everyone?  Please let me know if this is not convenient for any of you.  Jan 
D.
