I'm pretty sure SITA is a French company.  Have we decided that French 
counterparties are ok?

Please prepare a deemed ISDA for the SITA deal.  Please forward to Jarrod 
Cyprow on the confirm desk. Please note the only credit specification is a 
cross default to third party debt.  Let me know if you have questions.

Thanks,
Tanya
