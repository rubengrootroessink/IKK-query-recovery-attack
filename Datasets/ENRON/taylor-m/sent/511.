Here are several of the contracts we are planning to use for the online 
system.  I wish I could tell you these are the final (or even the most 
recent) versions of the documents but things have changed so frequently that 
I'm afraid these may not be quite up to date.  They do have the advantage of 
being in my directory and therefore available to send to you today.  I don't 
think the final changes will be significant but if you want to use these as 
starting points, please let me know so I can be sure you have the latest 
material.

The PA is the Password Application which is the only document the prospective 
counterparty actually signs by putting pen to paper.  The first time the 
counterparty logs on to the system with its approved password, it is required 
to agree to the ETA (Electronic Trading Agreement) by clicking on an "I 
Agree" box after scrolling through the agreement.  The GTC's are the 
contractual terms that apply to online transactions if there is no master 
agreement in place.  Legal will have the ability to restrict a counterparty 
to trading only certain products online if we feel it is necessary.  While 
most financial transactions will be governed by GTC's that look like our 
"Omnibus" documentation, the weather derivatives look more like a "Deemed 
ISDA."  One final complication, the credit group has asked us to create two 
sets of documents: one for highly creditworthy counterparties which will have 
no credit provisions included and a second set for counterparties credit is 
not quite comfortable with which will contain a provision allowing us to call 
for collateral if we choose.
