Greg,

Here is the ETA version in my directory.  I think a few minor changes may 
have been made (e.g. EnronOnline LLC is now the Enron party) and the 
definitive version is on the website.  You can access it there if you have a 
guest user ID.  If you need an ID, just let me know and we'll have the EOL 
people issue one for you.  I'm also attaching an early version of the 
Password Application (current versions also online and accessible even 
without an ID) since it may cover a few issues not addressed in the ETA.  I 
usually think of the two pieces as one agreement.

Mark

Mark, I have been asked by our commercial people to review Dynegy's form of 
electronic trading agreement and to see how it compares to our EOL electronic 
trading agreement.  Could you e-mail or fax a copy of our form to me?

Also, I am currently reviewing three Canadian power financial products that 
have been proposed by our new power trader to go on EOL.  I will send them to 
you to have a look at in the next few days.

Thanks

Greg
