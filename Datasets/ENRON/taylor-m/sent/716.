I did havea brief conversation with Janice about this but don't remember her 
conclusions.  For financial transactions we are attaching the GTC's.  That is 
the way we handle the regular telephone trading and in an attempt to make the 
online trading look as much like telephone trading as possible we continue 
the tradition.  If in current liquids trading the terms and conditions are 
not sent as part of the confirm (where there is no master in place) I don't 
know why we need to attach them for online trading.  If the back office needs 
a Word version of the GTC to make their job easier there should be no problem 
getting one for them.

Mark:  I'm not sure if Janice had the opportunity to talk to you about the 
point of attaching GTC's to on-line confirms or not; however, since she is on 
vacation this week and we started trading liquids on-line today, Alan 
suggested that I contact you and find out the outcome of this ongoing 
question.  Do we attach GTCs to each confirm that's sent out to the EOL 
counterparty?

Thanks.

I have not had any discussions with Mark Taylor on the point of attaching 
GTCs. I don't know why it has been determined to be appropriate to do the 
attachment. Please consult with Mark on this and let me know what you find 
out. Thanks.

Alan

You will recall that we went to a meeting last month w/ the EOL people while 
you were out of town.  That meeting revealed that a lot of work still needed 
to be done on the confirms.  Of course, there still hasn't been time to 
finish the liquids products EOL confirm templates, and I think the priority 
got less urgent, since these products will be among the last to be traded by 
EOL.  But the quesiton lingers about the need to attach GTCs to each confirm 
that's sent out to the EOL counterparty.  It seemed to us that perhaps you 
and Mark Taylor and others might have had discussions on that topic ahnd 
reached some conclusion.  Rob Cass made a rather cogent appeal that we not 
require the attachment (lots of manhours, for one reason, since the computer 
will not automatically generate the GTCs or autofax them).  But we never had 
a chance to talk about this, so I'm wondering if you could give me your 
thoughts.  Thanks.

By the way, it looks like the SK deal closing is on for next week, so I'll be 
leaving for Singapore on Monday.

Have you had a chance to review and finalize the templates for any of our EOL 
confirmations?    

Also, have any decisions been made on "GTC" attachment/no attachment?

Thanks for your help!

Lynn
