Mark, 

This resume is the daughter of a Director in Human Resources.  She has a law 
degree and has worked as
a legal assistant/paralegal throughout her career.  I do not think her 
background is as strong as some of the other
candidates that you have seen.  But, I decided to send it anyway because it 
is an employee referral.  Take 
a look at it and let me know what you think.
