		 Subject: Stopped anti-energy amendment!!!

Today we were successful in killing an amendment that was offered by Rep. 
Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) in the House Banking Committee during its markup of 
the Commodities Future Modernization Act of 2000.  This amendment would have 
stricken language that provided an exclusion from CFTC jurisdiction for all 
non-agriculture transactions (energy, metals, broadband).  The amendment 
failed, largely due to pressure from Enron, by a vote of 20-12.  Rep. Ken 
Bensten (D-TX) joined Chairman Leach in speaking against the amendment.  

In more positive movement, yesterday the House Commerce Committee passed its 
version on the bill including a provision that exempts metal trading 
multilateral trading facilities from CFTC jurisdiction.

Congress goes into recess tomorrow and we will have a better sense on how the 
Rules Committee plans to reconcile differences between the versions of the 
bill later this week.  The Senate is still the unknown.

Call me at any question - Chris

Bradley: 

We have learned that two amendments will be offered tomorrow my Rep. Maloney:

#1  - Strikes lines 15-25 from page 41 and the entire page 42 (these are the 
sections of HR 4541 as reported out of the Ag. Committee which address the 
exemption for all most non-agriculture commodities trade on an electronic 
facility.

#2  - Request a comprehensive study on the President's working group, DOE, 
and FERC.  

We strongly oppose amendment #1 which intends to more heavily regulate the 
energy derivatives industry.  Please have Rep. Bentsen voice his opposition 
to this amendment.  My guess is that amendment #2 should and will be ruled 
non-germane, however this is not a compromise we would support.  

Thanks - Chris
