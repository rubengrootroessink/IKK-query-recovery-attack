I think this has already been sent to you.  Just wondering, though, why this 
is being lumped together in one complex transaction instead of splitting it 
into two.

Mark,

I think this is the SWAP confirm that we were looking for yesterday.  Do I 
need to send this to Julie Gilbert.?  Anyone else?   Please advise.  Thanks.

Maria,  Please follow this message with the attached file to Gareth.  For 
some reason I cannot get it to go to Gareth directly.

Gareth,

Attached is the current draft of the swap confirmation for the Petrobras 
transaction.  The swap has two components -- the fixed/Libor rate swap and 
the "spread" swap.  The fixed/Libor swap is composed of the amounts computed 
pursuant to clause (i) of the definition of fixed amount and clause (i) of 
the definition of floating amount.  The amounts computed pursuant to clauses 
(iv) and (v) of the definition of fixed amount and clause (ii) of the 
definition of floating amount is the spread swap.
This is going to be a very unusual and highly structured swap in many 
respects in order to tailor it to the risk sharing that exists in this 
transaction among Petrobras, the Lenders, and Enron as swap provider. Because 
the swap includes both the rate swap and the spread swap, the benefits and 
obligations under the swap will need to be allocated internally at Enron 
between EI and ECT.  Randy and Scott recommend that a memorandum be generated 
that will reflect the manner in which this allocation will be made.  
Essentially as it is explained to me, ECT will be allocated the benefits and 
obligations related to the fixed/Libor swap and EI will be allocated the 
benefits and obligations related to the spread swap.
One other feature that EI will be responsible for is the Deferral Amount 
mentioned in the confirmation.  This arises if a Reserve Deficiency occurs 
and the Reserve Indemnity is no longer in effect.  In this situation, if any 
amount is owed to ECT on the rate swap the Company will not have sufficient 
cash flow to pay the full amount due to ECT and the Lenders.  The Lenders 
will be deferring a prorata part of their interest and principal, and ECT as 
swap provider will also have to defer a prorata part of the amount due to 
it.  The amount to be deferred is called the Deferral Amount in the attached 
draft.  EI will be responsible for any Deferral Amounts that may arise.  If 
after a Deferral Amount is generated, the Company is able to recoup any of 
the Deferral Amount, the portion payable to the Swap Provider under the 
Participation Agreement would be a "Makeup Amount" and would be allocated to 
EI when received under the swap.
A great deal of additional thought and fine tuning will continue to need to 
be applied to this portion of the transaction to make sure that it 
coordinates as appropriate with the Credit Agreement, Participation Agreement 
and Transaction Documents.  Any suggestions that you or the ECT swap lawyers 
may have would be appreciated.  One thing that would be useful would be a 
"breakage clause" that would describe in as much specificity as posible how 
the breakage would be computed whenever it is necessary to adjust the 
notional amounts under the fixed/libor swap.
