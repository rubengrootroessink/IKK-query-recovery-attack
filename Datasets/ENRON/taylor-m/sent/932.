Nora

Mark Taylor has led Enrons' legal end on Enron Online. I want us to meet with 
him and benefit from his experience in the e-arena. He is available tomorrow 
at 11 am or 4 pm. Both these slots are available on my calendar.  Can you let 
me and Mark know if any of these times work for you ?

Thanks


Harry
