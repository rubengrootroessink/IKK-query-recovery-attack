My apologies but I'm afraid this one slipped through the cracks in my e-mail 
and I never responded - has this issue been addressed?

Hi Mark,  this is an email that I recieved from Lisa Gillette, who is a 
member of Product Control and is in charge of the Customer Registration 
Process.   In reviewing this process, I think this is a concern that truly 
falls in your realm.  Please review and get back to Lisa or myself.


"There seems to be some concern abou the Customer Registration from.  As of 
right now the Registration Form does not include a "State or Country of 
Incorporation" and needed to know if the form should be amended to include 
one.  Please let me know either directly or via Carrie Southard if this is 
something that we need to take care of."

Thank you,

Lisa Gillette
