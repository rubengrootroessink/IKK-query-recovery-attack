Transacting  Question 4 - last line "accepted or rejected immediately upon 
receipt by the EnronOnline system" or "accepted or rejected by the 
EnronOnline system immediately upon receipt."  
  Question 5 - similar comment - build in concept of processing immediately 
upon receipt by the system.
  Question 9 - Can the Master User give others Master User privileges or can 
traders within a company view each other's transactions if the Master User 
authorizes it?  If so, deleat Back Office User and substitute "and others 
authorized by your Master User".  If not, is it possible there will be more 
than one Back Office User?  I so, insert (s).

Products  Question 6 - last line "at the best price available on the 
EnronOnline system (if it is within the range you specify)"

Registration  Question 13 - still needs an answer.  Should it also apply to 
trader user ID's & passwords?

Legal   Question 3 - Password Application,not Agreement;  "framework for 
transactions carried out"

Earnings Related Questions - Will these be posted for all to see?  If so, we 
should have a Corp. lawyer look these over (SEC concerns).  These seem more 
appropriate as answers for PR and IR to have ready in case anyone asks. 

You will no doubt recognize that I have exercised the utmost restraint - 
contrary to my every lawerly instinct - in commenting only on provisions that 
were identified as current changes.
