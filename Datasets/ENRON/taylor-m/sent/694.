Adele:

Here is a draft of a letter agreement amending the online Electronic Trading 
Agreement.  Please let me know if it is ok and I will have a copy executed 
and faxed over to you.

My apologies for the delay - I thought I had sent this to you last week but I 
can't find any record of it so I must not have done it.

Mark
