We have reservations with Eric, the golf pro, on Friday afternoon at 3:00.  
He thinks 4 or 5 holes will takes us 1 1/2 to 2 hours.  We don't have to play 
just holes 1 through 5 but can pick and choose -- based to some extent on 
where other people are playing.

Saturday afternoon you have a massage appointment at the club at 2:00 with a 
manicure/pedicure to follow at 3:00.  My massage is at 2:00.  Amanda decided 
not to participate since she will need to get ready for the party.  She is 
going to try and get lunch reservations for us all at Boar's Head for 11:45.
