He's doing PR and IR for them - what they do isn't entirely clear to me - 
something to do with accounting software I think.  They are going to launch a 
web site next month.  We'll have to get together and let him give you all the 
details.

Too bad you didn't call when you got in - I wasn't able to find Mr. B until
about 8 - we missed the first half but went anyway.  Have you guys been up
to
anything fun lately?  Did you know T has a new job?  He's at an internet
start-up called iVita.
