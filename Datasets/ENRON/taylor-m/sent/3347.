Bill doesn't get there until Friday eve. so no golf and I had assumed he 
would be with Amanda on Saturday.

We may miss out on tea.  Any idea what the hours are?  We won't be done with 
golf on Friday until 4:30 or 5:00.  You won't be finished with your nails 
until 4:00 or 4:30 on Saturday (and then there's the law school bbq and 
Amanda's do).  I don't know the agenda for Sunday's afternoon.
