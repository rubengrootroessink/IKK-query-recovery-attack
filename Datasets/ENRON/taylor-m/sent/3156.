Dear MARK

January is the month for both taking stock and looking forward. If one of 
your gardening resolutions is to make your landscape more interesting for a 
longer season, you may enjoy the new issue of A Year in the Garden, our 
electronic newsletter, now available online, at 
http://www.populardemand.com/alliance/x.jsp?c=16210086&o=16718164&u=16718166
We offer suggestions for perennials, shrubs, and trees whose long-lasting 
seedheads, brilliant berries, or colorful bark can brighten your garden, and 
your mood, next winter.

Of course, if you're looking for ideas to enhance your garden from April to 
October, we have those plants, too. The offerings in our Spring 2001 
catalogue -- perennials, annuals, bulbs, Roses, vines, and shrubs -- are 
available now on our Web site. You'll also find a host of new plants 
available Only on the Web! 
http://www.populardemand.com/alliance/x.jsp?c=16210086&o=16718164&u=16718168
We look forward to serving you. If you decide to order, please reference 
email code 11851 when prompted at checkout.
