Dorice,

I was not expecting a letter from Crawford Bayley but I have dealt with them 
in the past so I suppose it is possible that the letter is intended for me.  
I have no objection to your opening the letter to determine its contents.  
You might wan t to wait a few days for the other Mark Taylor's reaction.

Mark

Dear Mark,
I received a registered letter yesterday addressed to you at our Singapore 
office. It is from Crawford Bayley & Co. Solicitors & Advocates in Mumbai, 
India. Are you expecting a letter from them by any chance?
Actually yesterday I called another Mark Taylor in London and left a message 
on his voicemail but till now, I haven't got a reply. From what I understand, 
there are  2 Mark Taylors in Enron, so I'm not sure which one this letter 
belongs to.
Kindly advise if you are the one and if you want it forwarded to you by 
courier or mail. Pls provide your RC a/c as well.

Thank you,
Dorice.
