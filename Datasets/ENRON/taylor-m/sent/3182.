I'm very flexible on who comes along - no views at all on that score.  It 
would help to know the number and cabin sharing arrangement ahead of time so 
we can book the correct size boat.  You can always change the amount of 
groceries but at some point all the boats will be reserved.

I called Keswick last week and gave them my credit card number for the extra 
room - it looks great from the website.  Will you be golfing or should we 
make massage appointments?  Now that I think about it, I'm not sure which 
days we have reserved - another alternative might be to stay near DC on the 
day we get back from sailing (Inn at Little Washington?).  My guess is it's 
an all day affair getting from a little island to DC so we may get in pretty 
late.
