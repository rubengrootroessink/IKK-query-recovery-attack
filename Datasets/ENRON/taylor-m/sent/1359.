Amanda,

Thanks for your note.  It looks to me like the schedule breaks down as 
follows:

Possible Date: October 12 - 15
My Reaction: I will be speaking at a conference in Sedona, AZ (not known for 
its great sailing)

Possible Date: November 3 - 8
My Reaction: I have another speaking engagement in NYC right after that 
(makes it sub-optimal for me) plus Bill can't go

Possible Date: Thanksgiving
My Reaction: You guys can't make it

Possible Date: New Years (travel Sat. 12/30, pick up boat 12/31, back in the 
office Mon. 1/8/01)
My Reaction: Everybody can go - and since Monday is a holiday only 4 vacation 
days used for a full week of sailing - Perfect in every way (if we can get 
flights and a boat - I haven't checked this yet)

Possible Date: Later in 2001
My Reaction: Works for me but I hate to put it off so long

So my preference is to try for New Years and fall back on early November as a 
second choice.  If you want to go for less than a week now and a full week in 
2001 when Bill can go we can do that, too.  What are you guys thinking?  
Since we won't be going at Thanksgiving, how are you going to talk your mom 
into dealing with the holiday?

Mark
