Hey Mark,
Nice to hear from you. Sorry we missed all those appointments. I even missed 
the happy hour with Tana and Marie. How long are you going to be in London. 
There is no chance I'll be there before the 15th. I was scheduled to be back 
in Houston  next Monday but it looks like I am spending the next week in 
Abuja, Nigeria. Let me know what your plans are for the following week. 

I don't recall any such deviations from the norm, on the business note , that 
is. The agreements were pretty much standard. You did such a great job, I 
wouldn't want to temper with perfection, would I? Miss you all. Say hi to the 
rest of the gang for me.

Hey Yao!  How are you doing these days?  We never see you anymore.  I'm going 
over to London on Saturday - any chance you'll be in that part of the world?

On a business note, we are getting set up to trade energy commodities and 
derivatives online and one of the things we have to do is figure out what we 
can trade with each potential counterparty.  Do you remember negotiating any 
master agreements for ECT that did not contain the necessary elements for 
trading energy commodity derivatives?  In particular I'm thinking about 
things like the trade option exemption representations and the commodity 
derivatives definitions provisions. 

Thanks!

Mark
