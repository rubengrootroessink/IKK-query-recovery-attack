Glad you liked them.  Yes, cats do seem to like to explore all sorts of 
spaces - grocery bags are always a good bet.  I remember Dusty, the cat we 
had in Bethesda, used to like to sleep at the foot of my bed - under the 
covers.  Go figure.  I'd be happy to send you acopy of the photo of me.

And yes again, the online platform mentioned in the analyst's report is the 
system I've spent so much time on over the last nine months or so.  It's kind 
of exciting to see a project in print like that but now it means we have to 
really make it work!

I received the package from MetLife on the Long-Term Care insurance.  I had a 
couple of questions which I called the company about (premiums, pre-tax vs. 
after tax, etc.) and would be happy to go over it with you.  Do you want me 
to send the stuff to you or should we just chart about it frst?

Love, Mark
