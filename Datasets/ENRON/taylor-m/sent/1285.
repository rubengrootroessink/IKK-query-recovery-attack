Dave - my comments are below in red.  I'm assuming that "end of the day" is 
the end of the trading day, but this seems a bit ambiguous since the trader 
in Japan may be thinking about a different "day" than the trader in London, 
etc.  Will the orders be cancelled if our trader removes a product during the 
day and then reactivates it?

Mark,

Further to our conversation today; How is this?

You have offered a price limit order for aaa mmbtus of yyyyy at a price of 
xxx. If the price you specified becomes available on EnronOnline, the system 
will automatically try to fill your submission and a transaction may result.  
Your submission may be filled partially or completely depending on the volume 
available. This submission will remain active until for the earlier of (i) xx 
hours and yy minutes from your submission, or  (ii) until you cancel it (by 
highlighting it and pressing the cancel button on the main screen), or (iii) 
the end of the day. The submission  will not be withdrawn by your logout. 
Price limit orders are processed by price and then by timestamp. Therefore, 
if other price limit orders for the same price have been submitted before 
yours, then they will be filled before your submission is filled. This can 
result in other transactions completing at the same price as your price limit 
order, while your price limit order does not complete.
