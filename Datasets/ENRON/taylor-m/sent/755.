I tried to send this to your juno address and it came back.  Just in case you 
are home, I also received the following from the PR department a few minutes 
ago:
Be sure to watch Chairman and CEO Ken Lay on Fox News today.  He will appear 
on "Our World" with Neil Cavuto at 4:30 p.m. CST to discuss Enron's year-end 
financial and operating highlights.

I received the attachment you sent to me at Christmas but was not sure how 
well it worked for you to recieve them.  I took a roll of film to be 
developed and they had a special on having the photos returned on a disk as 
well as prints.  I though they were the Christmas pictures that I could send 
to you right away - but it turns out it was an old roll.
