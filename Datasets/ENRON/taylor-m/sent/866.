Highlighted means that we have an agreement that you are not comfortable with 
at this point?  I just finished going through the European names with Michael 
and Paul.  Luckily a small enough office that we can get through the actual 
CA's pretty quickly.

Any chance we have any flexibility on ATT, Lucent, Air Products, Dow, DuPont, 
GE, IMC, Minnesota Mining&Mfg., Pitney Bowes, Praxair, Sprint.  We only have 
5 that we can take off without needing to put additional names up?

Here is the revised list - there are several European entities that we showed 
in our database so I have highlightedd them as well.  There were also several 
from Friday's list that were still there so I have also bolded those.  I'll 
try to track down what happened with those entities (Cinergy, DPL, NJ Nat 
Gas, Niagara Mohawk & Washington Gas Light).
