Andrea and Fabian;

Over the past few days, Randy Young, Mike Guerriero and I discussed the 
proper manner to have the both of you working as an integrated legal team in 
Argentina.  According to Mike, the below listed activities are being pursued 
in Argentina:

Wholesale Origination
Retail Origination
EES
EnronOnline
Power Trading
Gas Trading
Weather Derivatives
Energy Finance
Networks

Although I would be comfortable to leave the workload division up to you, I 
would like to suggest the following (bearing in mind that there is never a 
clear understanding about "where you draw the line"):

Andrea:  Wholesale and Retail Origination; EnronOnLine; Power and Gas 
Trading; Weather Derivatives; Energy Finance.
Fabian: Wholesale and Retail Origination; EES; Energy Finance.

Please correct me if I am wrong, but it seems to me that there is not a 
significant difference between Wholesale and Retail Origination deals in 
Argentina.  In view of this, I would suggest the two of you assist all 
Origination deals (regardless of being a Wholesale or a Retail deal).  Also, 
both of you should be involved in Energy Finance as I believe such deals 
would arise from Wholesale and Retail Origination transactions.  In short, 
both of you would do legal support to "Origination", however, Andrea would 
focus on Trading and Fabian would concentrate in EES type of deals.

In addition, Fabian would manage Luiz Watanabe's workload in Argentina, but I 
would leave this to Luiz to structure and implement.

Kindly let me know if my thoughts make sense to you and please return to me 
with your comments asap.

I have not made any reference to "Networks" as I have no idea what it relates 
to ...  Is this related to Enron Communication ?

As a final note, please be advised that our baby should arrive on Thursday, 
July 23.  As of such date, I will be available by e-mail and cel phone only.

Rgds,

Sami
