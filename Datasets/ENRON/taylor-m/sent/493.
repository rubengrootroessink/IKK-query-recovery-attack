Mark,

I spoke with Lynda Clemmons today at the NY roadshow, and understand
that in Shari Stack's absence that you are the best one to follow up in
ref: draft confirmation sent to Shari a few weeks ago.

See attached final draft, in case you do not have it readily available.

I will be out of the office Friday 9/24, but will otherwise be available
to discuss.  PLease review the attached, and if it makes sense, perhaps
we can schedule a call to discuss and wrap things up.

Rgds

See attached for your review, which has been approved/reviewed by George
Judd as well.  Other than meetings tomorrow (Wed)  morning, I will be
reachable so we can wrap this matter up.  Perhaps we can touch based in
the p.m., so we can discuss the nature of the changes from our end.  Let
me know what works for you.
