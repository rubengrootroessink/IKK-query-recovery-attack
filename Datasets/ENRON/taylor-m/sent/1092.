There is a meeting on my calendar for Friday morning to discuss Phase 2 
content issues with people from the Research Group - not sure if this is the 
same issue or not.

		 Subject: EnronOnline Content Approval

The launch of Phase 2 of EnronOnline will include significant enhancements 
and additions to the EnronOnline web site.  One of the attributes of the 
Phase 2 launch is the development of individual Commodity/Country Home 
Pages.  The objective of the individual home pages is to allow each commodity 
group create its own web site (within EnronOnline) and to deliver a more 
personalized experience for the customers.  A significant aspect of the home 
pages is the addition of content which will be developed at a desk and or 
company level.  The content which we are adding will be much more dynamic and 
require constant changes.

In this light we will need to develop an approval process which protects 
Enron however does not completely impede our effort to provide current 
interesting content on the web site.  In addition we will need to make sure 
that we include the neccessary disclaimers to avoid other issues.

To date we have started to accumulate a significant amount of content 
(written, audio, PowerPoints and video) which is scheduled to be included in 
the Phase 2 launch.  We will need to sign off on this content within the next 
couple of weeks.

I have asked Lorraine Becker by copy of this note to arrange a meeting to 
develop a process of content approval.
