My comments:

It's not clear to me what it means to say that Joe Hockey "joined" in the 
launch (end of first paragraph).
They may be planning to update this just before release but the numbers in 
the fourth paragraph have increased (I think it's up to $90 bil.) .
The word "values" should probably be "value" in the last line of the fourth 
paragraph.

Attached is a first draft of a press release announcing the availability of 
Australian and Japan weather derivatives through EnronOnline.  We currently 
plan to issue this press release on May 26, in conjunction with a briefing 
event in Sydney.  However, there is a slight possibility that the 
announcement will be moved up to July 19.  Since there are a number of 
subsequent approval steps, your early review and comments would be 
appreciated.

Dave, please let me know whether you would like to run this by Louise now or 
have me make any recommended changes and send it to her directly, later.

Thank you for your attention to this request.  I will be in the office 
(1-713-646-6423) for the remainder of the week if you want to discuss this.

John
