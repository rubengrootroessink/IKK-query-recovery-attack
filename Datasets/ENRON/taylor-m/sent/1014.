The hardest part of preparing the Long Descriptions is making sure all of t=
he=20
terms used in th GTC's that need to be defined elsewhere are covered.  I'll=
=20
have to leave the final determination to the people who drafted the GTC's. =
 I=20
also have to point out I don't know much of anything about how bandwidth is=
=20
traded, but here are the comments I was able to come up with to the Long=20
Descriptions:

Bandwidth Units - This concept has been difficult for me - it's not entirel=
y=20
clear to me where the definition of this comes from - is it the reference i=
n=20
the box at the top of the relevant Annex?  If so, maybe we should add a lin=
e=20
something to the effect of 'Bandwidth Units shall mean DS-3 for this=20
Transaction.'  Or better yet you might consider a generic reference to the=
=20
relevant Annex that should apply which might let you delete the sentence=20
referring to the quality as well.

Does 'DSO' need to be defined somewhere?

The way the different Price definitions fit together has also eluded me -=
=20
there is a formula in the Long Description and a different formula in the=
=20
GTC.  Unless industry trading convention is to the contrary, the site makes=
=20
more intuitive sense when the volume quoted and the price quoted use the sa=
me=20
units.  If the volume is Bandwidth Units and the price is a per mile number=
=20
some counterparties (or perhaps more likely their lawyers) may be confused.=
 =20
The GTC contains the defined term 'Unit Price' which is in $/Bandwidth Unit=
. =20
It seems to me that if we can quote the price as the Unit Price and the=20
volume as Bandwidth Units, we can ignore the number of DSO's per Bandwidth=
=20
Unit and the number of DSO miles for the transaction. =20

Since they won't change from one product to the next, the two sentences=20
beginning with 'Any party entering into a Transaction...' could be moved to=
=20
the GTC.

The term 'Contractual Currency' is not used int he GTC.  Can the=20
parenthetical reference come out?  (The EnronOnline people may care about=
=20
this more than I.)

If the numbers of miles and DSO's need to stay in the Long Descriptions, I=
=20
would suggest that you change the references to make it DSO's per Bandwidth=
=20
Unit (both where the number is introduced and in the price formula) and tha=
t=20
the unt of measure against which the price is quoted be 'per DSO mile per=
=20
month'.

Is the volume on the quotes page a monthly or total number?  This needs to =
be=20
clear from the Long Description.


So for example, if you follow all of my suggestions, you might end up with=
=20
something like this:

A US Bandwidth Transaction with Enron Broadband Services, L.P. (=01&EBS=018=
)=20
pursuant to which the Seller shall sell and the Buyer shall buy the quantit=
y=20
of Bandwidth Units submitted by Counterparty via the Website.  The price=20
shall be as submitted by the Counterparty via the Website.  Annex A-1 of th=
e=20
General Terms and Conditions shall apply to this Transaction. =20
The term of the Transaction shall begin at 12:00 a.m. (EST) on the Effectiv=
e=20
Date and continue to 11:59:59 p.m. (EST) on the Termination Date. The=20
Effective Date is <Start Date> and the Termination Date is <Termination=20
Date>. =20
The Transaction shall be for Bandwidth between the New York Market Pooling=
=20
Point (111 8th Avenue, Suite 1517, New York, NY 10011, NPA-NXX: 212-462,=20
CLLI: NYCMNY83H62) and the Los Angeles Market Pooling Point (530 W. 6th=20
Street, Suite 300, Los Angeles, CA 90014, NPA-NXX: 213-362, CLLI:=20
LSAJCAWZH04).
The price is quoted in US Dollars.=20
The unit of measure against which the price is quoted is one Bandwidth Unit=
=20
per month and the quantity shown shall be in number of Bandwidth Units per=
=20
month.=20


If quoting the price as a per Bandwidth Unit number doesn't work it would b=
e=20
more like this:

A US Bandwidth Transaction with Enron Broadband Services, L.P. (=01&EBS=018=
)=20
pursuant to which the Seller shall sell and the Buyer shall buy the quantit=
y=20
of Bandwidth Units submitted by Counterparty via the Website. The number of=
=20
DSO=01,s per Bandwidth Unit is 672. The price shall be as submitted by the=
=20
Counterparty via the Website.  Annex A-1 of the General Terms and Condition=
s=20
will apply to this Transaction. =20
The term of the Transaction shall begin at 12:00 a.m. (EST) on the Effectiv=
e=20
Date and continue to 11:59:59 p.m. (EST) on the Termination Date. The=20
Effective Date is <Start Date> and the Termination Date is <Termination=20
Date>. =20
The Transaction shall be for Bandwidth between the New York Market Pooling=
=20
Point (111 8th Avenue, Suite 1517, New York, NY 10011, NPA-NXX: 212-462,=20
CLLI: NYCMNY83H62) and the Los Angeles Market Pooling Point (530 W. 6th=20
Street, Suite 300, Los Angeles, CA 90014, NPA-NXX: 213-362, CLLI:=20
LSAJCAWZH04), for a total of 2,446 DSO miles.
The price is quoted in US Dollars.=20
The unit of measure against which the price is quoted is one DS0 mile per=
=20
month and the quantity shown shall be in number of Bandwidth Units per mont=
h.=20
Therefore, the Contract Price will be calculated as follows: price x the=20
number of DS0=01,s per Bandwidth Unit x the number of DS0 miles x the numbe=
r of=20
Bandwidth Units.

Please let me know if you have any questions - I will go ahead and approve=
=20
the product in the system so you can proceed without me if necessary.
