Tanya and Mark,

We're starting to talk to some resorts about doing weather deals and I wanted 
to give you guys a heads up.
We don't have a structure in place and don't have financials yet; we should 
be getting them sometime this week. 
But, we would like to start sending the ISDA documents so that they can get 
comfortable with them.

Mark: Please send the docs to Dick Deutch,  his number is 314.432.4000. 

Details:
North Peak Resort
10920 Schuetz Road
St. Louis, MO  63146

We're thinking about doing a 1,3 or 5 year deal.  We've already mentioned the 
letter of credit to them.  
The deal might be done on the event of temperature hitting below 28-30 
degrees.  
Please call me if you have any questions.

Best Regards,

Lucy
