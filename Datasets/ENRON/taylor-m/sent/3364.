The recent amendments to the Commodity Exchange Act essentially codified the 
prior regulations on this point.  If this technique was effective in 1998 it 
should still be effective today.

I think there is a fax from Doug Harris on the reorg file with the CFTC 
rules. I will try to find it.

Telecon with Douglas Harris (AA New York):

1. The "$10m total assets" requirement technically needs to be satisfied at 
all times.

2. No clear definition of total assets but his view is that total assets on a 
US GAAP basis should be satisfactory.

3. If the LLC were to issue an interest free note to an Affiliate and on 
lends the proceeds to Affiliate 2 then the receivable from Affiliate 2 would 
qualify for the $10m total assets test.

4. If the LLC were to issue an interest free note to an Affiliate and the 
proceeds are used to fund on going trading then if due to losses total assets 
were to fall below $10m then technically LLC would need to top up total 
assets for the losses incurred.

It would appear from the above that the most effective route is to fund the 
LLC by way of an interest free loan and for the LLC to on lend to affiliates.
