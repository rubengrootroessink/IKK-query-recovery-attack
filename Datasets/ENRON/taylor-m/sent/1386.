Sheri -

I don't remember being consulted about sending these documents by e-mail (but 
that doesn't mean it didn't happen - just that I don't remember it).  It 
sounds like a valid concern - any reason we can't just send people to the web 
site and ask them to print out the relevant PA?

Mark -
Now that my responsibilities have been increased to include both EnronOnline 
and Clickpaper, something was brought to my attention that I am concerned 
about.  Clickpaper has been instructed not to send password applications to 
customers via e-mail.  This is something we have been doing since the 
inception of EnronOnline.  The concern is that customers will alter the 
language in the agreement, sign  and return it to us - hopefully, this will 
not happen, but could be a valid concern.  I am hoping you can shed some 
light on the original decision that was made to allow sending the PAs to 
customers electronically.  One solution that we could implement in the future 
is to send the file to the customer in .pdf format; however, the customer 
will need the applicable software to launch the program (we could include a 
link to download this).  The immediate solution is to discontinue this 
practice until I have discussed it with you.  I know you are out of the 
office until Monday, and I am out the rest of the week as well.  Please let 
me know your thoughts when you return.

Thanks!
Sheri
