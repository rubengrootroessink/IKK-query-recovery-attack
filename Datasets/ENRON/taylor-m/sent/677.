Hi Marc!

Yes, we're having a few friends over Sat. night for "Holiday Cheer" which at 
our house means cocktails by the Christmas tree and maybe some of my 
wonderful-tasting but horrible-for-you egg nog.  We'd love to see you guys.  
It's just an 8 to 10 kind of thing so even if you have other parties to go 
to, you could make this one the kick-off.

The extent of FABULOUS in our Y2K plans is in the price of the bottle of 
champagne we're going to share at home that night.  I asked T if we should 
plan anything and got the "quiet night at home" reply.  That, of course, will 
change to "Why didn't you plan anything?!" around 12/29 or 30.

How's BMC?  What are you doing for them?  Do you know Clayton Williams?  I 
think he still works there.

Give us a call so we can catch up.  Tell G we said hi & hope to see you 
Saturday!
