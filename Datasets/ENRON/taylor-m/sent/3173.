Mark,
Following our meeting, please find attached a very preliminary guideline for 
the 3rd party Pipelines contract. Also, I am attaching a document, which 
describes the charge structure. As Dave mentioned the numbers shown are not 
final.
We will be working on a detailed description of the scope of services, as 
soon as we have it we will send it to you.
Please let us know if you have any questions
Thanks
Carlos
