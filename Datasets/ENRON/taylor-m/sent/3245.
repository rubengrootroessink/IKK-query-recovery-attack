Stephanie:

This is like a very complicated game of musical chairs.  Right now there ar=
e=20
people in the offices that have been designated for Michelle and Gail.  We=
=20
can't move you guys in until we move them out.  We can't move them out yet=
=20
because we don't have any more places to move people!  There is a design th=
at=20
has been drawn up to create some additional space (essentially by shrinking=
 a=20
lot of other spaces) which I hope will be built out by mid March.  That's t=
he=20
best I can do right now.  Sorry for the confusion.

Mark
