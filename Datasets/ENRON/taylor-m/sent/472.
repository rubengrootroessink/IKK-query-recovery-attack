Hey Dave!

Thanks for your note.  Believe it or not, it actually is "good to be back."  
And thanks to Louise's timely intervention, I actually get to stay in Houston 
this week instead of coming over to London for the ISDA meetings.

We discussed the need to have the lawyers review the long descriptions 
yesterday and Mark Dilworth is checking on whether or not all the lawyers 
actually have access to the necessary programs on their machines.  He and I 
are meeting later this morning to talk about several of the items in your 
note and we have a meeting scheduled for tomorrow morning to show all the 
lawyers involved how to use the system to review the long descriptions.

The other topics I had on my list to keep moving this week are the matching 
of GTC's with products and continued progress on the Counterparty spreadsheet.

Harry Collins is the emissions guy.  I'm assuming he'll be part of this 
process tomorrow and I'll ask him to take a close look at the long 
descriptions and how the mesh with the GTC's.

Finally, I agree with you on the GTC variables issue.  My plan is to ask the 
lawyers involved to focus on this as they review the long descriptions for 
which they are responsible.  With me here to answer questions that may result 
in more progress but I'm still not convinced that's enough.  I hope to be 
able to spend some of my own time looking at these as you have over the last 
couple of weeks but realistically I don't think that will happen very soon.  
Maybe you can help me prioritize:  should I look first at areas with 
predicted high volume or areas where we have the least confidence in the 
quality of work to date?

Talk to you soon.

Mark

Mark,

Welcome back!

I am wondering if you could lend a hand on a few areas on the legal side of 
EnronOnline:

1) GTC Cross reference (see prior email)
2) Product Long Descriptions - these are now available in the same format as 
the customer will see - i.e. all put together by the system, as opposed to 
individual sentences in a spreadsheet. The traders should have set up all of 
the products which were required for the simulation (I haven't confirmed 
this). These products would be a good place to start and should provide a 
representative sample for the lawyers to look at. There are a few changes 
coming, as requested by Louise Hansen, Stacy Dickson and Janice Moore which I 
have not yet incorporated (but hope to within the next 2 days or so) - 
otherwise, the other products should be OK as they contain text derived from 
the spreadsheets which the lawyers have approved.

It would be helpful if you could organize for each of the lawyers to access 
the Product Manager, so they can see the long descriptions for the Products. 
Someone in the Product Control Group should be able to show you how to access 
the long descriptions in the Product Manager 

3) Emissions - Are you the emissions guy? I haven't actually discussed these 
with anyone - not sure if the lawyer list I have includes the person who 
should be looking after this?

  Mark Taylor
  Leslie Hansen
  Jeff Hodge
  Janice Moore
  Alan Aronowitz
  Harry Collins
  Stacy Dickson 

4) I still do not have a warm and fuzzy feeling that the GTC variables have 
been properly cross-referenced to the spreadsheets, and that the two work 
together to form a cohesive whole. I might just be paranoid, but I think this 
area needs closer examination. Perhaps you could spot-check a couple of GTC's 
against the products and see what you think?

Thanks for your help


Dave
