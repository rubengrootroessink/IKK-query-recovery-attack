We can try - an we'll ask the planners to put that in the design.  But Mark 
H. has indicated a desire to get rid of as many of the tall walls as possible 
and he approves all of the construction requests personally, so we may not 
succeed.

Mark, Dina told me that she will be sitting in the space that's now a file 
room for Linda Guinn.  We would both like the high wall that separates us 
left up if possible.   Do you think that would be possible???????
