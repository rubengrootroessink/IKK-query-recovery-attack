Mark, Taffy said you're under the weather. Hope you're feeling better by the 
time you open this. The attached draft is revised slightly from the one I 
previously sent to you for review. The changes are nonsubstantive from your 
standpoint - -  most of them were made to clarify that there will be 
offerings from the pipelines other than open seasons. In making the changes, 
I forgot to do a redlined draft for you, so I am faxing to you a copy 
redlined by hand. 

Thanks again for all your help.

Tony
