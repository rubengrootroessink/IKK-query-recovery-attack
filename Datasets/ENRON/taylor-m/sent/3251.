Approved.  Do we have extra monitors/keyboards already on the floor?

Mark:

Samantha Boyd is in need of a new computer monitor/ keyboard.  The monitor 
screen is visibly unclear which makes it extremely difficult to read.  In 
addition, the keys on the key board are sticky.  With your authorization, can 
these items be replaced with new equipment? 

Please advise.

Thanks,
