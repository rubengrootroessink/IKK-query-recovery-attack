Subject: Time to Celebrate!

We've actually reached and passed our target of 300 executed master swap 
agreements, so Bill Bradford and Mark Taylor would like to invite the 
Legal/Credit financial trading team to  a celebration!  Please join us on 
Wednesday, December 9 from 5:30 to 7:30 (or longer!) at Cafe Noche located at 
2409 Montrose (just north of Westheimer at Fairview).   Please RSVP so I can 
get a head count.

 To give you an idea of where we were and where we are now, the earliest 
Pending Swap Update I have dated 7/27/94 (shortly after I started with Enron) 
shows:

ISDA Masters:  10
Other Masters:  44
Total Counterparty Masters:  54
Internal Masters:  3

Our current master total per Lotus Notes are:

ISDA Masters:  164
Other Masters:  158
Total Counterparty Masters:  322
Internal Masters:  57
Current drafts out to counterparties:  595

Kudos to everyone for a job well done!
