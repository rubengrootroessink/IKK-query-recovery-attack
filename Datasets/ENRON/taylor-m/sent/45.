Brynjar

It was good seeing you on home ground the other day.

This is just a brief note to remind you of ECT Legal Department's policy 
regarding trading documents.

As you know, all trading documents must be approved by Legal before they can 
be used.  We maintain on a database in London all approved forms of trading 
documents and this database needs to be promptly up-dated as new market 
documents surface.

As our "first line of defence" it is very likely that you will encounter new 
trading forms before anyone else in the organisation. I would therefore ask 
you please to send to Martin Rosell any non-approved form of trading document 
(whether in the form of a broker confirm, an amendment to the NPTA Terms etc) 
as soon as you receive it. This will enable Martin to implement the approval 
process as quickly as possible.

Many thanks, as always, for your help.

Regards

Paul
