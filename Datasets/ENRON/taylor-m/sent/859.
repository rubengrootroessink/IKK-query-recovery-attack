Here is the revised list - there are several European entities that we showed 
in our database so I have highlightedd them as well.  There were also several 
from Friday's list that were still there so I have also bolded those.  I'll 
try to track down what happened with those entities (Cinergy, DPL, NJ Nat 
Gas, Niagara Mohawk & Washington Gas Light).
