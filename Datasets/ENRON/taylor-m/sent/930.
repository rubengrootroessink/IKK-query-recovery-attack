I guess it depends on where you got the prices - were they from a particular 
publication?  If not, I would suggest that you go to the NYMEX website and 
check for older prices there and you can cite to that.  Let me know if that 
doesn't work.

Subject: Cite for NYMEX Futures

Doug Leach said you were the expert.

I am publishing a chart using NYMEX settlement average prices by month in 
1998 and need to cite where the #s come from.  Doug said you would know.  Is 
there a data bank that has these prices or a hard copy that I can reference 
(publication, title, date, page).

Thank you very much,

ROB
