This is the site you had trouble looking at a few weeks ago - I had to send 
the address a couple of times.

I have to admit, I don't remember our having discussed this (although the 
message suggest we have been considering it for some time).  What is this 
website and what are we supposed to be looking at it for?  I apologize if we 
let this slip, but I frankly have no memory of it.  In any event, I will look 
at it as soon as possible.  Ken and I are both away this week but should be 
able to look at it and get back to you beginning of next week.  Thanks.

This is a follow up note concerning the disclaimer statement for the Western
Power internet page.  I would like to know how this is coming?  Has the 
outside
councel reviewed the site yet?  I would like some comments back in the next
couple of days if possible.
