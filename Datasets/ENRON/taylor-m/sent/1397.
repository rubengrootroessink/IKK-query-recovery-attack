We should get together with the right tax person/people - maybe Jeff can 
figure this out.

I just spoke to Frank, and spoke to Jeff Blumenthal earlier this week about 
tax issues arising out of Amita executing documents on behalf of EOL and 
ENA.  Frank just informed me that the Japan office has also been provided 
with stamp of Sheri Thomas's signature so they can execute PA's out of 
Japan.  Frank and I were thinking we might want to get together sometime next 
week to discuss this.
