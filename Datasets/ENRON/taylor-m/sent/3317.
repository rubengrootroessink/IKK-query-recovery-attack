I think it's a nice idea.

Can we send Stephanie, Susan and Tana each some flowers on Friday (Panus will 
be back) as a thank you for the extra work they are doing (and will do) in 
Samantha's absence?  I think it would be a moral booster and a good way to 
say thanks.  If yes, can Holly coordinate?

Thanks.

Holly, please touch base with me if Mark approves before you arrange the 
flowers.
