I am on Continental Express Flight 4100 from Houston to Cincinnati
 Depart: Houston (IAH), 23-Dec-00 at 11:00 AM
 Arrive: Cincinnati (CVG), 23-Dec-00 at  2:26 PM

My flight on Tuesday is the same as at Thanksgiving: leaving Cincinnati at 
3:00.

If picking me up is a problem, just let me know and I can try to rent a car.
