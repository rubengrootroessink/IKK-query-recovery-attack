This may be one of the things we have to deal with in connection with the SA 
restructuring.  In the past it was easy enough to justify using Don's budget 
since in theory all of your work was for his benefit.  Now it isn't quite so 
clear.  I think we need to figure out exactly who you are supporting - is 
there a separate RC for Argentina trading?

Hi Brent!

Quick question.  In the past I have been charging your expenses to RC 0303 
which is Don Black's and Scott  Neal's RC.  You are listed in the system as 
having RC 0807.  Which should I be using?  Should your expenses come out of 
Don's and Scott's budget or yours?

-Becky
