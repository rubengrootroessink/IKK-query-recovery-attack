This issue was much easier when all we traded were energy commodities,=20
interest rates and currencies. The older versions of the policy provided th=
at=20
no Enron employee may trade any energy commodity for the account of anyone=
=20
other than Enron.  Beyond that, no Enron employee could trade a commodity=
=20
which was within their area of responsibility.  For example, I was not=20
permitted to trade natural gas futures for my own account but, since intere=
st=20
rates and currencies are not within my area of responsibility, I could trad=
e=20
them.  As the scope of our trading activities expanded it became more=20
difficult to identify the scope of the company's concern, much less to=20
articulate it.  We did however take a stab at it and the result is below. =
=20
This may be an area which could stand some clarification in the next versio=
n=20
of the Policy. =20

For now, I would suggest that the term "security" highlighted below should =
be=20
read to include equities and therefore not one of the commodities covered i=
n=20
the second numbered clause (i.e. the word "other" refers to items other tha=
n=20
those listed in clause (i)).  The result is that an Enron employee who does=
=20
not trade financial instruments, securities, financial assets or liabilitie=
s=20
for Enron may trade them for his or her own personal account.  To take this=
 a=20
step further, one could argue that an employee who trades the equities of=
=20
energy companies for Enron should not trade energy company equities for his=
=20
or her own account but could trade other equities - if it were me, I would=
=20
certainly make sure that Ted Murphy agreed with my analysis before I did it=
. =20
Of course, a wide variety of commodities remain clearly off limits for=20
personal trading - metals, ag commodities, bandwidth, freight, lumber, amon=
g=20
many others - for all employees.  As I remember it, this was done purposely=
=20
and if anyone disagrees with the scope of the policy they would be wise to=
=20
discuss the matter with the RAC Group as they make suggestions for Policy=
=20
revisions to the Enron Corp. board.

Employee Trading.  No employee of any Enron Business Unit may engage in the=
=20
trading of any Position for the benefit of any party other than an Enron=20
Business Unit (whether for their own account or for the account of any thir=
d=20
party) where such Position relates to (i) any financial instrument, securit=
y,=20
financial asset or liability which falls within such employee=01,s=20
responsibility at an Enron Business Unit or (ii) any other commodity,=20
included in any Commodity Group.

Cassandra,

Richard asked me to review this document before the traders on the UK Gas=
=20
Desk would sign it.

The UK gas desk adheres to all the risk management requirements of this=20
document. However, in Section VII , Miscellaneous, Employee Trading, the=20
document would appear to prevent any of us trading equities (amongst other=
=20
commodities) on our personal account as Equity Trading is a Commodity Group=
.=20
We are unsure if this is the aim of this agreement.

We have asked our compliance officer, Paul Simons to clarify the impact of=
=20
this clause for us.

We are not ignoring the document, we are waiting for clarification.

Thank you,

David Redmond
