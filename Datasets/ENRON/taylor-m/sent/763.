Enron Hosts Annual Analyst Conference; Provides
Business Overview and Goals for 2000

HOUSTON, Jan. 20 /PRNewswire/ -- Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE - news) hosted its 
annual equity analyst conference today in
Houston. Ken Lay, Enron chairman and chief executive officer, opened the 
conference by highlighting Enron's tremendous
growth across all businesses and the outstanding 700 percent return to 
shareholders over the past decade. 

     Enron presented key objectives for 2000:
     Continued strong growth in the core Wholesale Energy businesses.
     Break-out performance from Retail Energy Services.
     Rapid development of Enron Broadband Services.

Enron's ability to extend core skills and competencies to new markets was a 
recurring theme throughout the day.

Wholesale Energy Business

Growth prospects remain strong for Wholesale Energy Operations and Services, 
Enron's largest business. Wholesale energy
growth in North America is expected to be driven by the continuing 
deregulation of power markets in the United States and
large-scale energy outsourcing by utilities and large energy consumers. Enron 
expects to continue to broaden its early lead
across the European continent as markets quickly open to competition. 
Finally, Enron is rapidly expanding its wholesale
presence in other markets such as Japan, where large customers will be 
permitted to choose their electricity provider in March
2000.

EnronOnline will provide additional wholesale growth as incremental sales are 
generated through this innovative, Internet-based
transaction system. Over 450 customers around the world have used EnronOnline 
and over 10,000 transactions have been
completed since its introduction in late November 1999. Yesterday, 
EnronOnline transaction levels reached a new record with
over 700 transactions, representing a notional value of $250 million. 
Transaction processing costs with EnronOnline are
significantly lower than costs associated with traditional transaction 
methods.

Enron's Gas Pipeline Group is also well positioned to continue growing, with 
expansions planned or underway on several of its
systems.

Retail Energy Services

With over 16,500 facilities under management, the infrastructure is in place 
to service customers worldwide. As the strong
contracting momentum continues, Enron Energy Services is poised to rapidly 
increase earnings in 2000. Enron Energy Services'
goal for 2000 is to sign new contracts representing $16 billion in future 
expenditures by customers for energy and energy
services, nearly double the level in 1999.

Enron Broadband Services

The new name of Enron's communications business, Enron Broadband Services, 
reflects its role in the very fast growing market
for premium broadband services. Enron is deploying an open, flexible global 
broadband network controlled by software
intelligence, which precludes the need to invest in a traditional 
point-to-point fiber network. This Enron Intelligent Network is
widely interconnected to both other wholesale bandwidth carriers and to 
Internet service providers, thus providing the platform
for two new Enron business centers, bandwidth intermediation and broadband 
content delivery.

A direct transfer of Enron's core market making and risk management skills 
from its energy businesses, bandwidth
intermediation will provide capacity- holders a vast array of alternatives 
for flexible, low cost capacity. Enron will also provide
premium broadband content services, such as high-quality video-streaming and 
large broadband file transfer, with differentiated
levels of quality in a usage-based business model.

As announced in a separate release, Enron also reached an agreement with Sun 
Microsystems that provides for accelerated
development of broadband Internet services.

Enron is one of the world's leading electricity, natural gas and 
communications companies. The company, which owns
approximately $34 billion in energy and communications assets, produces 
electricity and natural gas, develops, constructs and
operates energy facilities worldwide, delivers physical commodities and 
financial and risk management services to customers
around the world, and is developing an intelligent network platform to 
facilitate online business. Enron's Internet address is
www.enron.com, and the stock is traded under the ticker symbol, ``ENE.''

This press release includes forward looking statements within the meaning of 
Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Although Enron believes 
that its expectations are based on reasonable
assumptions, it can give no assurance that its goals will be achieved. 
Important factors that could cause actual results to differ
materially from those in the forward looking statements herein include 
political developments in foreign countries, the ability to
penetrate new wholesale and retail natural gas, electricity and broadband 
services markets, including the energy outsource
market, in the United States and Europe, the timing and extent of changes in 
prices for crude oil, natural gas, electricity and
those relating to broadband services and content, the timing and effect of 
changes in interest rates, the timing and success of
Enron's efforts to develop domestic and international power, pipeline, 
communications, internet- related and other infrastructure
projects, and conditions of the capital markets and equity markets during the 
periods covered by the forward looking
statements.
