The Moorings people asked me to call back tomorrow when they'll have a better 
idea about the storm situation - they canceled all of their charter starts 
for today & tomorrow (no surprise) and she expected Thursday's to cancel 
also.  They still have everything for the weekend scheduled to go out but 
they weren't supposed to confirm any hotel rooms between now and Saturday.  
They were able to confirm a room for you for Sunday the 28th (the day we have 
to bring the boat back).  I'll let you know what happens when I get through 
to them tomorrow.
