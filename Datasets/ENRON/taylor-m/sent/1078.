This looks fine to me.  The tax section of the draft was a holdover from the 
initial survey done in Europe last year.  In this case, I assume that Lynn is 
taking care of the tax issues and may be using different counsel for tax 
issues.  In Brazil the entire tax section of the memo was deleted before it 
was sent to counsel.

Mark here is my markup to the survey.  I tried to be more specific in a few 
areas to adjust it to what is likely to happen in Argentina.  Let me know if 
you have any comments.  

Lynn we could use some help on drafting the tax questions in Section 9 to 
more specifically handle the unique tax situation in Argentina.  

Thanks.
