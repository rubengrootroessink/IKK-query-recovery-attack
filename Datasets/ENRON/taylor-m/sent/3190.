By now, you should all have your travel plans finalized.  Please help us in 
planning by providing your itinerary including flights and arrival/departure 
times to Marvia Jefferson if you haven't already done so.  We need this by 
tomorrow morning if possible, so we can finalize all plans for meals and 
transportation.   Please review the attached document for additional details 
on the ASE event including hotel, transportation, and schedule.  Changes from 
the previous communication have been highlighted in blue.



In addition, here are driving directions to and from various places should 
you require them.



Should you have any further questions, please feel free to call either myself 
at x3-6079 or Marvia at x3-9165.

See you in Dallas!
