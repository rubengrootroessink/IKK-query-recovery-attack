Here are my comments.  Do you want to add anything about the reason for 
this?  I don't think it's necessary from a legal point of view but might 
soften the letter a bit.

So, to hit the nail on the head, could you please review and amend/approve 
the following?



Thanks,

Dave

That's fine with me - we're taking that approach on the "override" letters 
that override existing master agreements.

Mark, 
I am fine with the user not signing.  It is your call though.

Stacy/Mark,

Can we revise the Texas Utilities letter so that the user does not need to 
sign, but accepts the amendment by transacting on the website?

As we have hordes of customers asking for User ID's, it would be appreciated 
if we could land on a final, legal-approved draft of the letter, combined 
with a list of affected customers for this morning.

Thanks,

Dave

Stacy,

Can we revise the text down to the following?

Dear [Customer]:

Please be advised that all U.S. physical natural gas transactions that you 
enter into with EnronOnline will be with Enron North America Corp. regardless 
of anything to the contrary on the website or in any General Terms and 
Conditions, if applicable.


This leter will be sent with the User ID, so it doesn't really require much 
of an introductory sentence.


Dave
