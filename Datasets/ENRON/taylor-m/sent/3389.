Thanks for forwarding all the e-mails while I was out last week.  I found 
this one in my in-box when I got back this morning.  Is it yours?

Dear Mark,

Thanks for keeping us updated on Tom. I am pleased to hear that he is making 
a good recovery. Please pass on our best wishes. I am wondering whether the 
hospital will have forwarded mum's card if he had already moved on to a 
convalescent home when it arrived. I have just sent a card to his home 
address but I do not have the post code. I hope it gets there.

I found out from Graham last night that he is returning to Somerset on 
Wednesday (23rd). I guess that makes it unlikely that you will get to see him 
this time. There is a strong possibility that he will come in October for the 
Jazz festival and will bring Jordan with him. Whilst he has been here he has 
had lots of people trying to persuade him to build houses for them, but I 
think he misses Jordan so much he can't wait to get home. I am amazed at how 
much work got done so quickly. The house in Lauragh is finished except for 
the painting, wood staining and floor varnishing. We can start using it now 
but we need to avoid putting in too much furniture until the floor is done in 
some of the rooms at least. Dad has been lending a hand with paths and garden 
walls and has helped with some painting. I am sure that Mum will help with 
some planting. All I need now is a couple of really nice weeks in the summer 
so that I can feel the benefit of it.

I hope you can find time to come over again sometime soon. When Alan returns 
from Vienna next week he should be in a much more relaxed mood, having got 
his conference presentation out of the way at last. I am sure he will be 
happy to spend some leisurely days with you and to take you down to Mum and 
Dad's and to see the house, etc. If Hilary still has her yacht when you come 
she might also be glad of some help to sail it. She has not ventured out in 
it since Richard died but is talking about sailing it if she can find some 
help.

Once the next month is over I can also relax a bit. We are just coming into 
exam time and we all get very fraught at this time of year (with the marking 
piling up).

At last the foot and mouth restrictions are lifting a bit and we are hoping 
that all riding activities can gradually resume. We have had a rather boring 
few months - not even able to ride out along the roads. We can now ride down 
to the beach but we still have to take care not to go near fields full of 
cattle or sheep! I have just started investigating the idea of a pony for 
Caitlin. She is riding my horse occasionally in the sand arena and is doing 
very well with him even though he is rather small for him. I think she might 
be ready for a pony now but finding the right one is not going to be easy.

We will look forward  to seeing you whenever you can manage to get flights.

Bye for now,

Deb
