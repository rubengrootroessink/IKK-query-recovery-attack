Do you have time to compare this opinion to our current form?  Justin tells 
me he started from a form that was a year or more old.

Subject: Form of ECT Legal Opinion

Mark,

I attach a draft form of internal ECT legal opinion that we are proposing to 
offer SWD, a counterparty with whom we are seeking to enter into a Master 
Swap Agreement. 

The impasse to date had been SWD's unwillingness to agree on the content of 
the external (V&E) legal opinion we were offering.  After considerable 
debate, SWD instead agreed to obtain their own form of external opinion (from 
Linklaters). 

In terms of the ECT legal opinion, the changes shown represent deviations 
from our standard form of opinion (as of August last year).  Would be 
grateful for your views at to whether these would be acceptable from Mark 
Haedicke's point of view, and also taking into account any changes that may 
have occurred in the meantime.  John Thompson (who heads up the Frankfurt 
office) would execute the Master, and I have already arranged for the 
appropriate corporate authorisation from Enron Europe Finance & Trading 
Limited.

One sticking point has been SWD's demand that the opinion given under 
paragraph 4 ("No authorizations, consents, etc.....") should also apply to 
SWD; this would seem unacceptable to me.

[Please note that we intend that Jim Derrick would give a legal opinion 
relating to the Guaranty.]

Regards and thanks

Justin
