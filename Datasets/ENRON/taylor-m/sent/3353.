I think we're committed to Keswick - haven't we paid for Sun. night there 
already?

I think you would love Inn at Little Washington - I don't know why but I just 
think you would.  Maybe we can get a reservation - it is on the way back to 
DC but presumably Bill will be heading that way anyway.  Alternatively - it 
might be nice to hole up at the Keswick.  What do you think?

I thoroughly agree about tea -- if you can reschedule your manicure the
timing would be perfect.  And you're right about Sunday afternoon too --
I'm sure by then we'll be ready for a rest.  Do we have plans for Sunday
eve.?  Do we care?

I love manicures but maybe tea would be more fun - If I cancel or move the
manicure maybe we could have a sip in the lounge before we head off to the
BBQ - I don't think we have to be the first ones at the BBQ.  Also, maybe
tea will fit in on Sunday too.  It will probably be a good point in the day
to sit down and to relax.  I'll call to see if they can reschedule the
maicure.

Did the pro happen to mention anything about dress codes on the course.
Most courses require a shirt with a collar (a polo  - not a t shirt) and
one or two courses in the world require golf shoes - most are fine with
sneakers.

I hope you like golf.  I took a lesson at the Doral ( the partner's retreat
was there this year) and they have a golf school there. It was a great
little school.   I'd like to go back down for a weekend to the golf school.
I don't think that I will ever be good at it.  But there are clearly some
tricks to the game ( it is like sailing - all degrees and very scientific)
that you can pick up at a golf school and its enough I think to go out with
other beginners.   If you like golf maybe you will want to go the weekend
golf school too ( on your way back from south america maybe).  Every resort
I ever go to has a golf course - I feel like I am always paying an extra
$50 per night for the golf - but never use it.  I'd like to take a few
lessons so I can play when I am on vacation.

The pro understands there are only three of us 'golfing.'  Since we needed
something for Fri. afternoon and you and Amanda seemed interested in the
golf I went ahead and made the reservation that way.

The manicure was Amanda's idea.  Never having had one, I just assumed they
dried them for you.  Would you rather have a facial?  I didn't ask about
the morning.

Do you still want to do golf without Bill?  I think I'd like to do it - the
pro will probably be happy to lose a body.

I think I will call and cancel the manicure/pedicure.  I think it is too
tight for me to hurry back to get ready with wet nalis.  You don't happen
to remember if they had any morning appointments?  I'll call.

Bill doesn't get there until Friday eve. so no golf and I had assumed he
would be with Amanda on Saturday.

We may miss out on tea.  Any idea what the hours are?  We won't be done
with golf on Friday until 4:30 or 5:00.  You won't be finished with your
nails until 4:00 or 4:30 on Saturday (and then there's the law school bbq
and Amanda's do).  I don't know the agenda for Sunday's afternoon.
