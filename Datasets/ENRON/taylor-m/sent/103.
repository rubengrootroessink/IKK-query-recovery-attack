You know, I must have received your message on Tuesday because I remember 
reading it - but I can't find it in my computer.  Can you resend so I'll have 
the dates?  My guess is you shouldn't arrange space for me.  If I can get 
there for part of the time and there is a spare couch then fine & if not I'm 
sure I'll find a room somewhere close by.
