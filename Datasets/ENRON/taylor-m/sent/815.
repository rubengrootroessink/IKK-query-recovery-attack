Jan:  Thanks for your note.  Tim Belden has asked Dana to book a conference 
room - maybe you can coordinate with her.  It might also be nice if there is 
a spare office or two that could be booked for the day (including the 
morning) so we will have a place to work when not in the meetings.  The only 
people I know of coming from out of town will be me and Ken Raisler, a lawyer 
with Sullivan & Cromwell in New York.  We will have a better idea of any 
audio-visual equipment we need as we get closer to the meeting date.
