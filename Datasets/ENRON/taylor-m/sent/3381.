Doug -

Below are my initial comments to the Blue Sox information.  I have some 
additional points to make and will provide those in a separate document.  The 
document attached is based upon the latest memo you forwarded; however, it 
must be a version prior to the one you provided at the meeting as there are 
some provisions in the meeting form that are not in the attached.

Call me if you want to discuss any comments.
