Yes - it's definitely time to think about this.  My suggestion would be that 
we try to get Don to pay the expenses since the trip would be necessary 
regardless of who she was working for (EI or ECT).  Of course, if he balks, 
we'll foot the bill.

Is it time to think about when to bring Andrea to Houston to meet Jim 
Derrick?  Who's budget would it come out of?
