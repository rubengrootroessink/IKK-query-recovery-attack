Subject: Vice President Feedback Measurement Report


As you are aware, we are in the middle of the VP Performance Review Cycle.  
On instructions from the Office of the Chair,  VP's and above will be 
measured principally on the Skills/Behaviors criterion.  This will also be 
supplemented by two additional indicators:

Providing Feedback to Staff
Participation in Recruiting efforts for Enron programs

Critical to the item "Providing Feedback to Staff" is your involvement in 
collecting this data.  Attached is a form that should be distributed to all 
your direct reports regarding this item.  The instructions ask the direct 
reports to send this information back to me.  I will collate the data and 
this will be available for use at both the December ENA Executive Review 
Meeting on December 14, and  the January 5-6 Enron Executive Meeting.  

Again, your involvement in helping me collect this data is critical to the 
success.  Please contact me at Ext 30649 if you have any further questions.
