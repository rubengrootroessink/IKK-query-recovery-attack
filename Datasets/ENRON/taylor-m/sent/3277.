I wish I could - unfortunately I will be out of town on vacation next week.  
Thanks for asking!

FYI. I have not committed to doing this yet. You had previously mentioned 
that you wanted to visit with Paul. If you have not already done so, this 
might be a good time to do so. Are you open to a meeting?
