I have received a bill from LeBoeuf for work done in June on the ACE 
insurance matter for a bit over $36,000.  This included around 23 hours by PB 
Wright ($12,000) and 38 hours by SD Avitabile ($13,000).  Does that sound 
right to you?  I have to allocate this to the business units - should it all 
go to East Power Trading?
