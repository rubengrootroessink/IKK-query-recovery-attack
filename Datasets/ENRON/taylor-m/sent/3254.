Just wanted to say hello.  I hadn't heard from you lately and wondered how 
things were going.  Have you moved out of the hotel yet?  I know how 
depressing it can be going home to a hotel room every night.  Even though the 
hotel where I lived for the first three months I was in Jakarta was very 
nice, it was still just a hotel room.  I was so glad to get out of there into 
an apartment - major quality of life improvement.

We've been just busy enough for me this month: Austin for a couple of days on 
Presidents' Day weekend, a Rockets game last Friday, and we're off to the 
Diverse Works annual gala on Saturday.   Ted wants to leave town to do 
something - anything - next weekend but I'm trying to talk him out of it 
since we're taking that week-long cruise starting the following Saturday.  
Since my arguments carry no weight, I'm just lucky that air fares are 
surprisingly high right now - $1000 rt to Ft. Lauderdale is even too high for 
Ted.

Ted's brother is working on a  project here in town so we had him over the 
other night for dinner.  Ted had planned - can you guess - tuna steaks, 
having conveniently forgotten that his brother is allergic to fish.  How do 
you just forget something like that?  Luckily they went to the gym ahead of 
time and Ted mentioned what was on the menu so they stopped at the store and 
bought his brother a steak on the way home.

That nice January bump in Enron's stock price is ancient history now - pretty 
much the whole thing has been given back.  I'm still going to buy a new car - 
looks like an Audi A6 - but just one.

Hope you are doing well!

Mark
