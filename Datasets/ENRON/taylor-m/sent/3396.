Thank you for submitting an order through iBuyit eProcurement.  
Unfortunately, the system was not able to determine who should approve your 
request.

Please route this document to the person who generally approves your 
expenditures and have them send an email to Enron IT Purchasing denoting the 
approval.

To facilitate the communication, attached you will see the list of items you 
ordered.



Thank you,

For future orders, we can update the workflow table to route directly to the 
approver if you provide the approvers' names.
