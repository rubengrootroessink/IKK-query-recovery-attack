Paul - 

Thanks for your voice mail.  We can't print the list of Reference Entities 
from the website because we have not been given access.  We do need to get 
that list to the various other reviewers in Houston and I am sure that is the 
list that Michael referred to.  

The EnronOnline people are probably concerned because they don't have a final 
list of Reference Entities for their launch.  That list absolutely must be 
scrubbed by the other GC's before it is approved.  

Mark
