Mark - the following issues pertain to the Enron Online Internet trading 
project, of which I am now a part.   In addition to having me forward this 
quick initial list of issues to Clifford Chance to look at from the European 
perspective,  Louise Kitchen suggested that Sullivan & Cromwell may also want 
to look at these issues from the US perspective for next Monday when she will 
be in New York.  Could you please advise ? Going forward, if there are other 
US legal issues facing the project, which clearly there will be, would you 
like me to co-ordinate them through you first, as with this request?    Thank 
you for your help.

Subject: Legal Issus with Hypertext Links

As Louise mentioned briefly in today's meeting, we need to obtain a view on 
the legal implications of  "linking" web pages and the news and information 
they contain.  Some specific issues we will need a perspective on include:

1) Legal issues associated with providing hypertext links to:
 -  3rd party websites (avoiding unauthorized links such as in the Shetland 
Times case in the UK). These sites may include other
    interesting energy sites
 -  links to news items (external URL sites), etc.. Is mutual consent enough? 
What are the liability issues? 

2) The flipside: Potentially allowing linking of our Enron Online site onto 
websites of third parties, (e.g. in the form of click of simple hyperlinks or 
through  "banner ads" which would take users from the external site,  such as 
an FT.com, and bring them to our site as a marketing tool).    

*3) Issue of Publishing/Re-distributing/Re-purposing news or other business 
information from other sources
    (e.g. E-Trade shows Reuters news - what sort of legal agreement are they 
likely to have in place on a global basis?)
    (e.g. Coral Energy - have an up-to-the-minute energy news presence with 
all stories footnoted as "copyright 1999 by FWN" - presumably another 
external news agency). 

Most of the above relates to our plans for a "News Viewer" and "Links Page" 
which would encompass both :
i) publishing Enron commodity-related news to external (and internal) users.
ii) displaying/re-distributing commodity news provided by an external agency 
(e.g. Reuters, etc.) to external and internal users.

How do we satisfy the copyright requirements of others (i), and ensure we get 
full copyright protection for our own news (ii) given that all of the above 
will likely be viewable globally  ?

4)  As discussed today, providing multiple hypertext links to GTCs .  
Although it would be far more preferable to automatically personalize the 
site such that only legal information relevant to that customer is seen, as a 
fall back option, would there be any issues showing the multiple links (i.e. 
would users know which GTCs applied to them if bombarded with various 
options).
