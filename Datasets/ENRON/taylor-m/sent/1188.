As I mentioned in my voice-mail, this needs to go somewhere that users might 
actually see it - e.g. a news ticker story.  Simply adding it to the Legal & 
Privacy Statement, while helpful, is not sufficient.




EnronOnline will assist users, upon request, in arranging for direct access 
connection (such as a "T1" line or other means of direct access) to 
EnronOnline, as an alternative to internet access.   Direct access 
connections might enable users to access EnronOnline more quickly than is 
currently possible through internet access.
