Louise,

I hope you had a pleasant weekend in N.O.  If you have a few minutes to 
spare, I'd like to get together with you this afternoon  to talk about the 
weather deal documentation.  As I tried to draft up the standard GTC's I 
realized there are more variables in these transactions than are currently 
listed in the short & long description lists.

Mark
