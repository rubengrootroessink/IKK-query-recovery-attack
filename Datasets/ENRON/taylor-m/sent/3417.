Are you the keeper of Enron's ISDA membership?  If so, can you let us know 
membership ID?  Tracy Cooper/Cynthia Harkness in EBS Legal are interested to 
access some ISDA publications which are limited to members only.  

Thanks,

Hi! 

Does anyone know who at Enron is the contact person for ISDA ( International 
Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc.) (http://www.isda.org) membership?

Sylvia

we are members of ISDA -- we are listed as a primary member -- however there 
is a place to logon and I don't have that password -- any idea who the keeper 
of that would be?

thanks!
