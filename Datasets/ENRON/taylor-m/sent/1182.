We have built three new Products Types called:

US East Power Fin Opt Knock-in 1
US East Power Fin Opt Knock-in 2
US East Power Fin Opt Knock-in 3

Please go into DataManager and approve these Product Types (look at attached 
Document for long description).  We plan to go life next week.  If you need 
help with the approval process contact Dale Neuner (ext. 39746) or myself 
(ext. 39938). Please Do Not Reject the Product Type. If you have questions or 
changes to the Product Type please contact me at your convenience. 


Thank you very much for your co-operation!
