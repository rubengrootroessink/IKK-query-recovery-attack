No trouble in N.O.  I was there for a conference with all 300 Enron lawyers & 
paralegals from all around the world - it didn't seem prudent to go looking 
for trouble with all those Company folks wandering around the Quarter!  I 
just came on home Friday evening & went to bed.

T. said you looked like you were having fun Friday night but didn't stay out 
late enough to find out how much fun.....
