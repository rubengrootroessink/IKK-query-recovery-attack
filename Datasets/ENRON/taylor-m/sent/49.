I have had cats all my life and NEVER had this problem!!
    Will think on it as no immediate solution - perhaps some sort of net
tied under the lowest branches....but if she is clever she will probably try
to jump onto it at its outside edges...
             AT least there is one other member of the family who definitely
is having a merry Christmas!
