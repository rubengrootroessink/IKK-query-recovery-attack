Mark and Allison.  It is too ambitious to plan to translate this on Tuesday, 
I think.  I need to work with you on the regulatory stuff.  I also will work 
on the other pieces.  And most of this is missing.  Allison, do we have the 
corporate structure pieces in place.  Do we have the financial stuff.  Yao is 
on vacation I know, Mark.  How much time do you have?  I'm swamped but will 
be in Brasil on Tuesday.

Attached is the description of Enron's marketing business worldwide and 
marketing plan for Brazil as supplemental information to be submitted with 
Application to ANEEL to request authorization to trade electricity in Brazil. 
Please make any comments you feel necessary by Monday evening so that I can 
send out for translation Tuesday a.m.

Mark, I will send all certificates and other information required under 
Resolution 265 when I receive the completed list.

Thank you,

Allison
