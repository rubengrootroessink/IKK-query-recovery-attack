I don't know anything about the Daishowa transaction but have to wonder why 
this information could be relevant to much of anything not directly related 
to EnronOnline.  To the extent we can't avoid disclosing it, I would think 
that the traders in Calgary will know how many of them trade using the 
system.  If that doesn't work I would try Savita Puthigai (x31787) or David 
Forster (x31861) on the EnronOnline team.

Chris, I think Mark is the person to ask, or Mark can refer you to the right 
commercial person.  I assume Investment Canada wants to know how many traders 
in Canada trade on EOL?  I also assume that this might in fact be a 
confidential matter that should not be disclosed and which should be 
irreleveant to an ICA application for the Daishowa transaction.  In any 
event, why is del Vecchio not dealing with this?

I have been asked to confirm this as it will form part of the Daishowa 
acquition Investment Canada Act filing.  I am advised that the filing will be 
confidential so I do not think it should be an issue.  Do you take any issue 
with this?  And if not, do you know who would know the answer?

Regards
CJG
