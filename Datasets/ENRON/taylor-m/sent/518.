Justin and Kal,

Pls. find attached, letters we will be sending out to the customers depending 
on what level of access we choose to give or deny them.  I would appreciate 
it if you could feed me your comments at your earliest so I can help the 
product control group create a template for future use.

Thanks,
Rahil
