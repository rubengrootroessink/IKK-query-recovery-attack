I may not understand the question, but Legal does not need to be informed of 
each ETA that is executed.

Please confirm whether legal does or does not require Global to track 
contractual relationships with counterparties where an Electronic Trading 
Agreement exists but there are no Online GTC's.

Thank you,
Karen

Subject: Notice to Global Counterparty

I spoke to Mark Dilworth about our discussion re: Global Counterparty being 
notified via e-mail whenever a customer 'signs' an ETA or GTC. Mark seems to 
think that this methodology is rather difficult, and the liklihood of it 
being accomplished anytime soon is LOW.

There is a report that will be generated with each days trading that will 
identify who our Active customers are (meaning a User ID and Password has 
been issued). That report will give us that day's exposure; exposure meaning 
there was activity for that customer, for that day; no exposure meaning there 
was no activity for that customer, for that day. With activity we would know 
that an ETA had been signed, and then you could go in and see that the GTC 
had been signed off (should be simple, as the GTC would match the Product 
Type being traded). This report would identify new customers as they traded, 
but would not identify those customers that sign an ETA and do not do any 
trades.

Mark has agreed that our idea is certainly do-able for Phase 2.
