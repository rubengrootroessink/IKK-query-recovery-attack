Mark,

Please find attached below the form of confirmation that Cathy Moehlman would 
prefer to use.  I sent her a confirmation for the deal done yesterday in our 
format and requested that she print it out, sign it, and send it.  Evidently, 
she does not want to use that format, and would prefer to use her standard 
form.  Please give me your thoughts.  Thanks.
