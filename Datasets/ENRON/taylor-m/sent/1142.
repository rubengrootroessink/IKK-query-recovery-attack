We may have a problem with adding our own time stamp.  First, I believe our 
agreement with Reuters limits our ability to modify their content and 
restricts what we can say about the current nature of the quotes (they are 
time delayed) and second, we don't want our time stamp to make people believe 
that the quote was even current as of that time - since it won't be.  It 
might be ok to have the entire quotes section headed by a line indicating 
when it was last refreshed.  Many sites providing quotes like this have a 
line (usually towards the bottom) indicating the delay period and most people 
using those sites know they have to refresh their screen to update them.  
Jason Peters is the expert on the terms of that agreement, so if you still 
feel like you need to add something you might check with him.

As I understand it, the answer is 'no'--we get a quote from Reuters but not 
the time stamp.  The time stamp that would appear is the one that we place 
next to it, telling the user when the quote was placed on the site.  So if 
you happen along at noon and you see 'ENE 70 9am', you know that you're most 
certainly not getting a recent price.

Will the Reuters feed contain a time stamp?  Some other sites let you know 
what  time the trade was done that resulted in the quote.

Dear Mark

Do you know of any legal issue that there could be about adding our own time 
stamp to a stock quote from Reuters (so that people viewing the site would 
know when the stock quotes were last updated by us)?

Let me know if I should direct this question to someone else.

Thanks Mark

Jay
