This is getting a bit confusing - is this list included in Bryan's "Final" 
list?

Bill

These are more names  for European reference credits which Brian intends to 
trade offline.  With the exception of two names ( TXU Europe and Helsinga 
Energia) the names look OK to me.  (They are all either publicly rated 
investment grade names or e - rated 5+ subs of major groups).  Are there any 
names here that you have an issue with ?

Dear All,

Attached is a list of 49 additional reference credits that we want to quote 
on the webpage. 
Could you please look through these names and let us know if you approve.

Thanks,
