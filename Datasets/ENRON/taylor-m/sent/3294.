Marcus - 

I understand you are the new physical power online lawyer - lucky you!  
Here's one that the EOL people are anxious to get covered.  I'd be happy to 
sit down and go over exactly what all this means and you'll probably want to 
talk to Tana a bit as well.

Mark,

Please take a look at this and advise me as to how I could move this forward 
for a Monday release.

Kevin- I apologize for not getting back with you on this. I don't know if you 
know but I have resigned from Enron and have only a few days left. I am 
swamped with a lot of other work and I have asked my boss, Elizabeth Sager, 
to appoint a new atty to handle EOL matters (until Leslie Hansen returns).

She can be reached on x36349.

Thanks,

Shari Stack
