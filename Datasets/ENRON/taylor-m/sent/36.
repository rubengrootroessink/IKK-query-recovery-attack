out who it is and then let me know so I can communicate with Martin.

Mark,

Following the message below, please be informed that I plan to come over to 
Houston 15 January next year and stay for 6-7 weeks (at Murphy's Montecito 
apartments).  Maybe we could change a few words on this before Christmas.  
Also, do you know to whom I may turn in order to settle the practicalities 
(invitation letter to show immigration authorities, insurance, car, etc.)?!

We ought to investigate the possibility of having a Wikborg lawyer over every 
afternoon, with the understanding that the Wikborg lawyer would also be 
available to work on our stuff in the morning. This is our chance to develop 
a relationship with a new Wikborg lawyer who could replace Jarle Erik. Please 
confirm the dates that you will be gone. I assume that you will be back in 
Oslo by March 1. Please co-ordinate your Houston visit with Mark Taylor. 
Thanks!
