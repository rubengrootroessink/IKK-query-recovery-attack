Sounds good to me.

Mark -

Francisco thinks that picking up Columbia would not be a big problem and that 
he can manage all of his Wholesale work while watching Columbia.  To my 
knowledge, Columbia should not present substantial work and would benefit 
from Francisco's watch.

I'm trying to keep Francisco working on EGA matters that he knows well and/or 
are less likely to "balloon."  Francisco has been willing to tackle a bit 
more than he currently has on his EGA plate, but he is also sensitive to 
making sure that he has sufficient time for all of his responsibilities.

Let me know if you have concerns.

Bruce

Given that South America legal resources are stretched thin, we will be 
checking with Francisco to see if he has time to pick up Columbia.  He knows 
it well and I don't believe that it will be particularly time-consuming for 
him.  But it would help free up Miguel Mendoza a bit for other South America 
matters.

I will expect Francisco to be cognizant of his other Wholesale obligations in 
saying "yes" or "no."
