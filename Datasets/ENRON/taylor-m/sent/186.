Nony,

I believe that Marcus von Bock in the Legal Dept is working on this and the 
huge project concerning the legal  issues surrounding the internet around the 
globe  (I  did the first Xtranet site for Switzerland towards the end of last 
year).

I have copied this message to Marcus.

Kind regards

Mark

Mark:

 Mark Taylor would like to have an update from someone in the London group 
regarding the internet trading plans in Europe.  In particular, he is 
wondering if there are enforceability/statute of frauds type issues in Europe 
like we might face here and what research has been done to date in that 
area.  I remember that during our January meeting you briefly discussed 
websites for Germany and Switzerland for power trading as well as procedures 
for contracting electronically, etc.  Would you be able to address Mark 
Taylor's questions in our upcoming meeting on Tuesday?  If not, could you 
help me identify someone else in the group that can address this issue?

Many thanks.
Nony Flores

 

Mark
