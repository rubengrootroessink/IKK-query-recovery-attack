I did get Janet the white top (Interlock turtleneck - Medium, color - white 
#A32027)  from Talbots.  It was the fleece vest that they didn't have in the 
stores.  I did not get the towels.

Glad the computer is working better for you.  It makes all the difference in 
the world to have it speed up.  For me it actually becomes more useful since 
I cant stand just sitting there staring at it waiting for something to 
happen.  

My paperwhites haven't bloomed yet - I do remember from the last time I grew 
some that the fragrance can be almost overpowering.  I wonder if people grow 
them outdoors when the weather warms up.  The smell might work better with 
more room to disperse.  This time I have six coming up all at once - I hope I 
can stand it!

Love,

Mark
