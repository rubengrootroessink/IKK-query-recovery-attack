In US financial trading (derivatives) we send the attachment each time, but 
it should only be 4 or 5 pages long.  This may be different in the physical 
trading world - I'll check into it.

Thank you  Louise,

Just one remark which came back to me already a couple of time.

When we close a transaction with our normal counterparties, why do we need to 
send the GTC each time since when we close OTC witrh these same 
counterparties, this is not necessary ?

They are finding that our confirmations are 13 pages long for a single swap. 
Do you think we could avoid sending the GTC for some of our most active 
counterparties ?

Regards

Raphael
