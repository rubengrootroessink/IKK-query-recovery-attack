 The addition of Paris is news to me so we may have to make a few extra 
modifications I had not anticipated.  Once you get the info why don't you 
take a crack at making the necessary changes & let me know.  It may be pretty 
obvious but I think I can walk you through it on the phone if it's not.

Louise,

In case you didn't get my voicemail we have been through the GTC's.  
Everything is fine with the exception of some blanks to be filled in 
concerning some European meteorological reporting agences (equivalent of the 
UK Met Office and US NWS) and the data sources.

 US is complete and as we have deals in UK and France this should be 
finalised with Mark's paralegal tomorrow.  On roll-out we only envisage US 
and UK cities, Paris and Oslo so we're only awaiting Norway info as a matter 
of urgency.  We're working Stewart Peter to get this info and the same for 
the other European cities for when they're added over time.

Regards,

Mike.
