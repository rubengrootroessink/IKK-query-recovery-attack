Mark

As per my voice-mail, here is a raft of GTCs including the US version.  The 
US version take on board S &C's comments, but obviously you will need to sign 
off on the US GTCs before we go live.  Grateful for any final comments asap 
as we are aiming to finalise them on Monday.

Many thanks and sorry its not much of a birthday gift (I'll make it up to 
you)!

Regards

Paul
