I'm not sure I agree with you.  There is a big difference between listing the 
price for a reference entity's credit online (i.e. in a nearly public manner) 
vs. providing a price quote to customers who request it.  The almost public 
nature of the marketing  may influence whether or not the reference entity is 
happy with Enron trading the product.  Even if they are not affected in this 
way, having given them notice in advance will at least give us moral high 
ground if the reference entity later decides to object.

Remove all references to EnronOnline its unnecessary in this context - 
suffice to say you will be trading through all the normal Enron methods.

Subject: letter to reference credits

Attached is the letter that we intend to send to CFO/Treasurers of reference 
credits.  The section on EnronOnline was recommended by Sullivan and Cromwell 
and reviewed by Goddard, Dilworth and Simons.



There may be a few minor edits before it goes out.

Thanks
