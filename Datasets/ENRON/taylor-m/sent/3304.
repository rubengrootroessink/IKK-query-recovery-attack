David - 

I haven't had a chance to look at this yet but thought I ought to send it on 
to you.  I will be out of the office (vacation) until the 27th and didn't 
want to lose the entire week.

Mark

ps - I lost all of my voice mails the other day and I think there was one 
from you regarding a possible conflict - my understanding is that we're just 
assigning a bunch of transactions over from one party to another and in that 
case I tend to think there's no problem.

Mark,
Please find attached a first Draft of a suggested outline for the Amendment 
to the ETA for having 3rd Party Pipelines posting prices on EnronOnline. 
Please let me know your comments and how you want to proceed.

Thanks
Carlos
