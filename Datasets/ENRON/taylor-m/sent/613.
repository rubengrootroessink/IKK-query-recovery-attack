When you get a chance, have a quick read.  John got approval on Wednesday 
from Skilling and Whalley to move forward quickly.  We have committed to 
quoting on 200 reference credits, in 6 countries using Enron Online by 15 
Jan.   As we intend to quote two-way prices on your biggest customers, in 
addition to everyone else, I want to make sure that we evaluate all of the 
implications.

 Pls. let me know your thoughts.
