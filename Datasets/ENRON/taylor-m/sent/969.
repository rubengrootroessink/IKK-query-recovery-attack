What do you think?  OK with me, although I think I'm supposed to leave for 
South America on Sunday evening (gone 5 days or so - this is the trip that 
has been postponed twice already so I won't be surprised if it is delayed 
again).

G & I were discussing having a Sunday afternoon cocktail party next Sunday
(Palm Sunday, April 16).  Considering it is kind of last minute, and it is
Palm Sunday weekend, we wanted to take a quick poll:

Question:
If we planned a gathering between 2pm-5pm on Sunday would you be able to
attend.

Thanks for your help.
