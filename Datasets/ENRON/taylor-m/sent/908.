Rod - can you tell me who the current proposed reference entity is and how it 
is related to the Duke companies that are parties to the confidentiality 
agreements listed below?  I need to know who the parents are and who the 
subsidiaries are and, if it is a subsidiary if it is a material sub of the 
reference entity.

Thanks,

Mark

Mark, herewith the list I referred to in my last email.  I've looked to see 
if there are any CAs with a Duke entity with an Enron European entity and 
there are none.

We ought to come up with a streamlined procedure for approving new reference 
entities (rather than having it attacked contemporaneously on all sides by 
several departments).

Thanks, Edmund
