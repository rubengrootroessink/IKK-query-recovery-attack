The first market disruption fallback (after a 3 day waiting period) is an 
"Alternative Price Source" which would need to be spelled out in the long 
description - but that only works if we have an alternative price source to 
specify.  It's also important to make sure that the feared event is included 
in the Market Disruption Event definition.  I think this is the relevant 
language from the GTC:

7.  Market Disruption.  If a Market Disruption Event has occurred and is 
continuing on any Trading Day, the Floating Price for such Trading Day shall 
be determined pursuant to the Floating Price Source specified in this 
Transaction for the first Trading Day thereafter on which no Market 
Disruption Event exists; provided, however, if the Floating Price is not so 
determined within three Business Days after the first Trading Day on which 
the Market Disruption Event occurred or existed, then the Floating Price 
shall be determined by reference to the Alternative Floating Price Source 
specified in this Transaction, if any, which is not subject to a Market 
Disruption Event.  If no Alternative Floating Price Source is available or 
has been specified, and the Market Disruption Event continues for more than 
three Business Days, then the parties shall negotiate in good faith to agree 
on a Floating Price (or a method for determining a Floating Price), and if 
the parties have not so agreed on or before the twelfth Business Day 
following the first Trading Day on which the Market Disruption Event occurred 
or existed, then the Floating Price shall be determined in good faith by 
Enron, by taking the average of two or more dealer quotes. 

"Market Disruption Event" means, with respect to a Floating Price Source, any 
of the following events (the existence of which shall be determined in good 
faith by Enron):  (a) the failure of the Floating Price Source to announce or 
publish information necessary for determining the Floating Price; (b) the 
failure of trading to commence or the permanent discontinuation or material 
suspension of trading in the relevant futures contract, options contract or 
commodity on the exchange or market (e.g., NYMEX) acting as the Floating 
Price Source (the "Exchange"); (c) the temporary or permanent discontinuance 
or unavailability of any relevant Floating Price Source; (d) the temporary or 
permanent closing of any Exchange acting as the Floating Price Source; (e) 
the imposition of trading limits by the Exchange such that there are limits 
on the range within which the price of the relevant commodity may fluctuate 
in the prompt month and the closing or settlement price of such commodity on 
such day is at the upper or lower limit of that range; (f) a material change 
in the formula for or the method of determining the Floating Price; or (g) a 
material change in the content, composition or constitution of the relevant 
commodity.

Further to John's e-mail below, I do not believe that we need to build this 
type of language for alternative settlement into the long descriptions for 
financial power products, as both the form of ISDA and the GTC that we use 
for confirming financial transactions (which contain the legal terms and 
conditions that will govern Canadian EOL financial power transactions) 
contain market disruption provisions.  These market disruption provisions 
provide the mechanism for determining the index price if the referenced price 
is unavailable or there is a material change in the formula or calculation of 
the referenced price, etc.  I am just waiting to confirm with Mark Taylor 
that the on-line form of GTC applicable to financial transactions is the same 
as for the form used for transactions not entered into through EOL.

Thanks

Greg

We should add some language to the EOL power descriptions to include a 
mechanism for alternative settlement in the event that the power pool price 
of Alberta becomes defunct.  I won't put any language in regarding market 
delay though.  My intention is to trade this product whether I have a PPA or 
not.
