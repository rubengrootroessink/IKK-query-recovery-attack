Good News:  Lenny weakening - max. winds down to 130 mph and pressure rising
Bad News:  The darn thing won't get moving - still just drifting a bit to the 
north & east

It's hard to describe which islands we care about on those maps - they're all 
so small they almost don't show up on the maps.  Luckily St. Thomas is to the 
west and a bit north of Lenny's current position

Here is a San Juan radar image that has St. Thomas marked and one of th 
recent forecasted path maps.
