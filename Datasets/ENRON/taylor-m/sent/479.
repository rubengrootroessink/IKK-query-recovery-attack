Please review and respond as to whether or not you want to adopt something 
similar for US products.

Thanks,

Dave and Romano,

Here's the language we drafted.  I've put it in a word document because the 
financial option text doesn't fit into the PAI box. As you can see the 
financial option was a bit trickier than the physical options!

Edmund (and Justin).
