It looks like Phase II of our construction project (over where Julia's office 
used to be) will be finished on the 18th so she will be moving into her new 
office that weekend.  I now have the plans for Phase III and it turns out 
your office will be included in the construction area.  Phase III will 
probably start on the 25th.  That could always slip but I wanted to give you 
as much notice as possible.

Hope you are all doing well.  Getting any sleep yet?
