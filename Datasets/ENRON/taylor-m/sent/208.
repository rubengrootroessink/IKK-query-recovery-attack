Looks good to me.  There is an airport in Burbank.  All the major airlines go 
there as well as Southwest.

The west desk has asked Christian and I to present a one-hour talk at a 
seminar to discuss physical and financial contracts for power transactions.  
I want to clear this with you for May 19.  I have no earthly idea how to get 
to Burbank. By plane?  SS
