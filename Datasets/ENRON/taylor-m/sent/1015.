The hardest part of preparing the Long Descriptions is making sure all of t=
he=20
terms used in th GTC's that need to be defined elsewhere are covered.  I'll=
=20
have to leave the final determination to the people who drafted the GTC's. =
 I=20
also have to point out I don't know much of anything about how bandwidth is=
=20
traded, but here are the comments I was able to come up with to the Long=20
Descriptions:

Bandwidth Units - This concept has been difficult for me - it's not entirel=
y=20
clear to me where the definition of this comes from - is it the reference i=
n=20
the box at the top of the relevant Annex?  You are correct. If so, maybe we=
=20
should add a line something to the effect of 'Bandwidth Units shall mean DS=
-3=20
for this Transaction.'  Or better yet you might consider a generic referenc=
e=20
to the relevant Annex that should apply which might let you delete the=20
sentence referring to the quality as well. We have changed the first senten=
ce=20
of the long description to read " A US Bandwidth Transaction with Enron=20
Broadband Services, L.P. ("EBS") pursuant to which the Seller shall sell an=
d=20
the Buyer shall buy the quantity of DS3 Bandwidth Units submitted by=20
Counterparty via the Website.

Does 'DSO' need to be defined somewhere? DS0 is a term generally known in t=
he=20
industry and is only used in the calculation of the Contract Price in the=
=20
long description, so we chose not to define it - also the definition is=20
incredibly long, complex and technical.  If you feel strongly about it, we=
=20
can include it, but since the long description tells you how many DS0's you=
=20
should include for calculation purposes, we didn't think that it was=20
necessary.

The way the different Price definitions fit together has also eluded me -=
=20
there is a formula in the Long Description and a different formula in the=
=20
GTC.  The formula in the long description differs from the formula in the G=
TC=20
(and in the Master Agreement) in order to accomodate the way that the price=
=20
is being quoted on EnronOnline. The quote represents the variable component=
=20
of the "Unit Price" in the GTC's and the Master Agreement - In order not to=
=20
confuse people, we decided to include the formula in both the long=20
description and the confirmation so that customers could know that the Unit=
=20
Price was calculated using the price quoted.  Unless industry trading=20
convention is to the contrary, the site makes more intuitive sense when the=
=20
volume quoted and the price quoted use the same units.  If the volume is=20
Bandwidth Units and the price is a per mile number some counterparties (or=
=20
perhaps more likely their lawyers) may be confused.  The GTC contains the=
=20
defined term 'Unit Price' which is in $/Bandwidth Unit.  It seems to me tha=
t=20
if we can quote the price as the Unit Price and the volume as Bandwidth=20
Units, we can ignore the number of DSO's per Bandwidth Unit and the number =
of=20
DSO miles for the transaction. =20

Since they won't change from one product to the next, the two sentences=20
beginning with 'Any party entering into a Transaction...' could be moved to=
=20
the GTC. Since bandwidth is such a new product, we really wanted to highlig=
ht=20
to customers that if they intend to take physical delivery of bandwidth=20
(which is what we are offering) they will need to establish connectivity wi=
th=20
us.  This is already in the GTC - but in an abundance of caution, we wanted=
=20
this fact highlighted, especially since connectivity will entail further=20
costs to the customer as well as signing documentation such as colocation=
=20
agreements, licenses etc. - this can be quite an involved process.

The term 'Contractual Currency' is not used int he GTC.  Can the=20
parenthetical reference come out?  (The EnronOnline people may care about=
=20
this more than I.) Agreed

If the numbers of miles and DSO's need to stay in the Long Descriptions, I=
=20
would suggest that you change the references to make it DSO's per Bandwidth=
=20
Unit (both where the number is introduced and in the price formula) and tha=
t=20
the unt of measure against which the price is quoted be 'per DSO mile per=
=20
month'. It is a quote for one DS0 mile of a Bandwidth Unit for a month. =20
Since the short description indicates the period for the contract being=20
offered, we felt like the quotation was pretty clear.  We are also a bit=20
sensitive to using too many defined terms referring to each other in the lo=
ng=20
description.  From a commercial perspective, we are comfortable that the=20
language used in the quote and the long description are clear and accurate.

Is the volume on the quotes page a monthly or total number?  This needs to =
be=20
clear from the Long Description.  If a Customer wanted to buy 5 of the OC3=
=20
Bandwidth Units quoted for the period from July 1- July 31, the Customer=20
would be entitled to 5 OC3's for the period from July 1 - July 31.  I hope=
=20
that this is responsive to your question - we weren't entirely clear.


So for example, if you follow all of my suggestions, you might end up with=
=20
something like this:

A US Bandwidth Transaction with Enron Broadband Services, L.P. (=01&EBS=018=
)=20
pursuant to which the Seller shall sell and the Buyer shall buy the quantit=
y=20
of Bandwidth Units submitted by Counterparty via the Website.  The price=20
shall be as submitted by the Counterparty via the Website.  Annex A-1 of th=
e=20
General Terms and Conditions shall apply to this Transaction. =20
The term of the Transaction shall begin at 12:00 a.m. (EST) on the Effectiv=
e=20
Date and continue to 11:59:59 p.m. (EST) on the Termination Date. The=20
Effective Date is <Start Date> and the Termination Date is <Termination=20

The Transaction shall be for Bandwidth between the New York Market Pooling=
=20
Point (111 8th Avenue, Suite 1517, New York, NY 10011, NPA-NXX: 212-462,=20
CLLI: NYCMNY83H62) and the Los Angeles Market Pooling Point (530 W. 6th=20
Street, Suite 300, Los Angeles, CA 90014, NPA-NXX: 213-362, CLLI:=20
LSAJCAWZH04).
The price is quoted in US Dollars.=20
The unit of measure against which the price is quoted is one Bandwidth Unit=
=20
per month and the quantity shown shall be in number of Bandwidth Units per=
=20
month.=20


If quoting the price as a per Bandwidth Unit number doesn't work it would b=
e=20
more like this:

A US Bandwidth Transaction with Enron Broadband Services, L.P. (=01&EBS=018=
)=20
pursuant to which the Seller shall sell and the Buyer shall buy the quantit=
y=20
of Bandwidth Units submitted by Counterparty via the Website. The number of=
=20
DSO=01,s per Bandwidth Unit is 672. The price shall be as submitted by the=
=20
Counterparty via the Website.  Annex A-1 of the General Terms and Condition=
s=20
will apply to this Transaction. =20
The term of the Transaction shall begin at 12:00 a.m. (EST) on the Effectiv=
e=20
Date and continue to 11:59:59 p.m. (EST) on the Termination Date. The=20
Effective Date is <Start Date> and the Termination Date is <Termination=20

The Transaction shall be for Bandwidth between the New York Market Pooling=
=20
Point (111 8th Avenue, Suite 1517, New York, NY 10011, NPA-NXX: 212-462,=20
CLLI: NYCMNY83H62) and the Los Angeles Market Pooling Point (530 W. 6th=20
Street, Suite 300, Los Angeles, CA 90014, NPA-NXX: 213-362, CLLI:=20
LSAJCAWZH04), for a total of 2,446 DSO miles.
The price is quoted in US Dollars.=20
The unit of measure against which the price is quoted is one DS0 mile per=
=20
month and the quantity shown shall be in number of Bandwidth Units per mont=
h.=20
Therefore, the Contract Price will be calculated as follows: price x the=20
number of DS0=01,s per Bandwidth Unit x the number of DS0 miles x the numbe=
r of=20
Bandwidth Units.

Please let me know if you have any questions - I will go ahead and approve=
=20
the product in the system so you can proceed without me if necessary.
