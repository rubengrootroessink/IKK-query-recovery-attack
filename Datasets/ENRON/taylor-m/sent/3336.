Bill,

Thanks for the info.

Just so you know, The Moorings provides airport transfers so there will be 
somebody with a "Moorings" sign waiting right after you get through customs 
who will get you into a van or bus to the base.  It's a little harder to get 
to Tortola from Houston so I leave at 6:10 in the morning but don't get there 
until a few hours after you guys (on AA5684 which gets there at 5:21).

 It turns out I also need everyone's birthday and address.  Mind sending 
yours along?

Mark
