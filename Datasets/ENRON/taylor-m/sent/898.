Hi Mark...it's no big deal to miss this dinner.....for April, they adjourn 
for the Easter break on April 14th so it would have to be at the beginning of 
April.  I think it would be fine to wait until May, after Easter, if that 
fits with your schedule.  Just let me know what works for you.

Sorry - it looks like I can not attend.  My travel schedule is pretty tight 
this month - do you think it makes sense to set something up for April?

Mark Taylor called this afternoon to say that he had been asked by Steve 
Kean's office if he could attend an ACCF dinner with Rep. Charlie Stenholm on 
March 8 in Washington (in place of Mark Haedicke, who could not attend).  
Taylor is checking with Haedicke to see if he should attend, but Taylor also 
wanted to check with us to see if there were other things he could do in DC 
if he came on March 8 before the dinner (hill visits, CFTC?).

I told him I would pass the message along to you for consideration.   He 
should know by the end of the day today whether he will actually be attending 
the ACCF dinner or not.
