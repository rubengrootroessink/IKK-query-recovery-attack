Yes, a standard presentation that shows generally what traders see when they 
use the system would be good.  We should definitely avoid being too technical.

Mark -- Chris and I were thinking that the standard presentation -- if it 
isn't too technical -- would be appropriate.    What are your thoughts?  Lisa

Yes.

What kind of demo is he looking for?

Is it just a general overview (i.e. the standard EnronOnline presentation)?

Dave
