Mario -

We have conducted our initial legal due diligence for the EnronOnline launch 
in Japan.  The advice we have received is that to the extent the agreements 
are enforceable under the law chosen (e.g. New York for the PA and ETA) they 
should be enforceable in Japan as well.  Local counsel is aware of our 
business and has not identified any other legal pitfalls.  We have not looked 
into the registration of domain names in Japan.  Please let me know if this 
is required.

Mark

Mark,

We identified some matters (listed below) related to EnronOnline launch in 
Japan. Please advise.

Are there issues to be addressed on:
  - the compliance with local corporate requirements to trade the products 
currently available in EOL?
  - the determination of issues surrounding electronic trading 
(enforceability)?
  - unanticipated regulatory impacts (both local and international trading)?
  - the registration of internet domain names in the local jurisdiction?
  - the compliance with local documentation requirements?
  - the compliance with local Trade Practices Act?

Thanks in advance,

Mario Parra Cardoso
