Stacey,

Mark H. and I met this afternoon to discuss the December conference agenda 
and have the following suggestions:

1.  Review of California Energy Litigation -- (Mark H. would be good for this 
one.  If he can't make it, we can probably find a substitute.)
2.  German Energy Markets
3.  Convergence of Commodity Trading Forms

There were also a couple of topics included on the Houston agenda this year 
that might also be appropriate:

Christophe's panel discussion on new markets
E-commerce panel

I have also copied several of the lawyers in our London office who are active 
in the derivatives and commodity trading world to solicit their suggestions 
for appropriate topics to be added to the agenda.
