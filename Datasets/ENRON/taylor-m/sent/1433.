Unfortunately Euromoney is no longer offering their courses.  They were by 
far the best around and it's a real shame.  There is a PLI course being 
offered in NY in mid November (at which I'm speaking on commodity 
derivatives) and ISDA has a conference in London on collateral arrangements 
and the ISDA Credit Support Documents.  Neither is anywhere near as good as 
the old Euromoney courses but both would probably benefit Jane.

Are either of you aware of any master documentation workshops being offered 
in NYC or London in the next few months that would be worthwhile for Jane 
McBride to attend?  I remember several years ago going to a program that 
Euromoney (or Eurocurrency) put on for 2-days focusing on ISDA's. 

Please advise. Thanks.
