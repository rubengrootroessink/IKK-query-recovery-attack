I think this is probably OK.  You should probably just check with Samantha & 
Tana to make sure they aren't planning something then.  Since it is Good 
Friday, it might be a little slower than usual.

I would like to take off April 9 - 13.  Although its not on the calendar, I 
know Susan is scheduled to be off that Fri, April 13.  I can come in on that 
Friday if need be.  Just wanted to check with you first.

Thanks,
Stephanie
