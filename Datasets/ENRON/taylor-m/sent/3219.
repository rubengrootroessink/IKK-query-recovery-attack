		 Subject: FW: Revised S.220 markup and summary


I am forwarding the amendment revisions discussed on this morning's call.

Attached are revised versions of the summary of proposed changes to
S.220/H.333 and the markup of the bill.  The only changes are to the new
provisions (in riders 344A and 352A of the markup) dealing with rulemaking
authority for the SEC and CFTC to address the treatment of accounts in
which both securities and futures are carried.  For your convenience, we
have included both clean and blacklined versions of the summary.  --
