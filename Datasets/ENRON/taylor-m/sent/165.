Marc,

Here's a draft reply to your latest e-mail, which I would send to all those 
copied on your note to me.  What do you think?

Marc,

We have sought, and paid for, advice from Indian counsel concerning commodity 
derivative transactions with Indian counterparites.  We have had that advice 
updated and confirmed in connection with this proposed transaction.  The 
result of that advice is that we will require an opinion from DPC's outside 
counsel that the proposed transaction is enforceable against DPC before the 
transaction can proceed.  While I have no legal objection to sending a form 
of L/C that would be acceptable to us, it doesn't make much sense to go 
through the exercise if DPC will not be providing the necessary opinions.

Mark
