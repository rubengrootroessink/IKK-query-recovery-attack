Agreed - can you please confirm directly with Erica that Tax has no problem 
with Enron Credit.com contracts being signed in the US.

Mark, It seems to me Erica's advice needs to apply not only to this NDA, but 
probably all of the NDA's that are going to originate from the Houston based 
EnronCredit.com business team.  Further, it should apply not only to NDA's, 
but their whole business they are originating from Houston, yes?  Maybe you 
need to talk to Erica...

and she is happy with it
Thanks

I'm sorry for the delay.  I looked at the agreement and I have no problem 
with it although, as a lawyer, it is dificult to envision how the English 
courts are going to apply Texas law.  I would like to know what this is about 
as I have no idea.  Can you please give me a call on 34916?  Thanks.
