Yes, I think you are right.

Mark:

I believe the reference to the credit annex is to the credit annex to the 
Interest Rate ISDA Master, so I assume you or someone in your group should 
review the amendment.   Am I correct?   I think Chase is drafting the 
amendment.

Prepay team;

Here's the latest on the restructurings that we thought we might be doing 
earlier in the week:

Molly and Chase have worked out an arrangement whereby we can post collateral 
under the existing deals without adversely affecting our cash position.  
Therefore a fast-track restructuring will not be needed at this time.  Chase 
and Teresa will negotiate an addendum to the credit annex allowing us to 
re-hypothecate collateral, and Molly is currently working out the operational 
issues associated with doing so.

We still intend to restructure the existing deals over the next few months or 
so; I'll advise as we get closer.

Best-
Davis
