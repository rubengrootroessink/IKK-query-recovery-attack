Mark Haedicke, Greg Whalley and I will be meeting with several people at the 
NYMEX on Friday morning.  It's possible (although not likely) that Dan 
Rappaport will attend one of the meetings.  I remember that we were very 
unhappy with his testimony earlier this year and I know we delivered that 
message to the NYMEX a couple of times.  What I'm not sure of is whether 
their testimony was toned down at all in subsequent hearings.  Are you aware 
of the content of the NYMEX testimony at those hearings and whether or not 
our complaints had been taken to heart when it was prepared?  I'm just 
wondering if there is anything we should bring up in our meetings if 
Rappaport does attend - either positive or negative.

I also heard just a few minutes ago that Mark H. had cancelled our trip to DC 
currently scheduled for 12/16 since he will be meeting with Commissioner 
Newsome tomorrow.  It might make sense to leave the December meeting on the 
calendar, though.  Seems to me the Enron message may get lost in the overall 
background noise of a big ISDA meeting.  Maybe I can come up alone and we can 
do a scaled down version of the originally scheduled meeting to get some solo 
time in the Commissioner's face.  What do you think?
