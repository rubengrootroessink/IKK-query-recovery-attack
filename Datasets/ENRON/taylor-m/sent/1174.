The least we can do is pass this news along.  Is there anyone else we should 
tell?

I think they'll send us another update once he's out of emergency and into a 
room.? Then it's real easy to call Ben Taub to find out a room number.? The 
address is below.? It doesn't sound like he can receive visitors yet.

Jann, phoned this morning and asked me to pass this information to the group, 
concerning Bobby Riggins. 
Bobby is a member of a bicycle team, while cycling this weekend, he and 
other members of his team were injured by a truck.? There was one death in 
the injured group and the others with major injuries.? Bobby is one of those 
with major injuries.? He is currently in the emergency room at Ben Taub 
Hospital.? Ben Taub hospital is located at 1504 Taub Loop, Houston, Texas, 
phone number: 713-793-2000.? He cannot accept calls, visits or flowers at 
this time, since he is in the emergency room.? An update will be e-mailed, as 
soon as one is available. 

Keep Bobby, his team members and their families in your prayers.
