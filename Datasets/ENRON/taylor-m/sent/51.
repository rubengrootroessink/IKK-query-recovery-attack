Subject: Commodity Derivatives Committee (Norway)

Earlier today, Thor Lien and I held a 1.5 hours presentation for the ten 
members of the above Committee.  The Committee has been assigned the task of 
examining issues related to commodity derivatives trading in Norway and to 
propose a concrete regulatory framework (currently financial commodity 
trading is not regulated in Norway) on 15 June next year at the latest.  

The background knowledge of the Committee members, representing different 
Norwegian interests, appeared to be quite shifting; while certain Committee 
members had in-depth knowledge of, for instance, EU capital requirements 
others revealed limited understanding of the functioning of the power 
markets.  The Committee took a great interest in the two regulatory points 
that I brought up, the lack of recognition of close-out netting in Norway and 
the forthcoming implications of CAD2.  The discussions sometimes were vivid, 
but I believe that we succeeded in getting most of our message through.  

The vice-chairman of the Committee (lawyer) invited us to render further 
comments in writing and said that he would return to us for further 
discussions when the drafting process was about to start next year.
