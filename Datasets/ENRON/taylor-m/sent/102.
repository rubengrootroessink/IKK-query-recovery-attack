Hey Amanda!

Yao just gave me your e-mail address.  He had told me you were at UVA a 
couple of months ago.  How do you like law school so far?  I have to admit I 
pretty much hated every minute of it.  Now that I think about it, I can't say 
that being a lawyer had been all that much fun either.  Oh well, the pay is 
pretty good.

I found this picture of my boat on the internet site of the charter company 
that rents it out for me when I'm not sailing (which is most of the time).  
When are we going sailing again?  Got any good vacation weeks coming up?  The 
Caribbean sure sounds good right about now......
