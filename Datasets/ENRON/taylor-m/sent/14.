INTERNATIONAL E-FARE FACTS  E-fares are only valid for round-trip travel
in Economy Class on United Airlines, and are restricted to the flights and
dates indicated. One-way travel, stopovers, and standby travel are not
permitted.

Fares are valid only for travel originating in the city or cities
indicated.

It is the passenger's responsibility to be in possession of all necessary
documentation for the destination country (valid passport, visa, etc.) at
the time of departure. United reserves the right to deny boarding to
passengers without the proper documentation.
Seats are limited and may not be available on all flights/dates. Offer is
for a very limited time and is subject to change without notice.

Reservations must be made using United's website at least one day
prior to travel. Tickets require immediate purchase by credit card when
reservations are made. Ticketing will be electronic (E-Ticket) where
applicable.  Otherwise tickets must be picked up at a United Airlines City
Ticket Office or at an airport location within 48 hours of making the
reservations or on the day of departure, whichever is earlier.
Credit card owner must be present to show the credit card used to purchase
the ticket as well as a valid picture ID.

Tickets are non-refundable, but a wholly unused ticket may be applied
toward future travel on United Airlines for a $75 USD service fee.
E-Fares are only available for travel on or after the date of purchase
and will not be honored retroactively or in conjunction with the exchange
of any wholly or partially unused ticket.

Changes to flight date, flight number and routing are not permitted. In
the event of a flight cancellation, customers will, at United's option,
either be reaccommodated on another United flight or be issued a
refund, but will not be accommodated on another airline's flights.

International fares may be subject to government approval.

Fares are subject to U.S. departure, agricultural, immigrations, customs
and security taxes/surcharges of up to $47 USD.  For travel to some
countries, additional airport, transportation, embarkation, security, duty,
equalization, passenger service and noise taxes/surcharges of up to $35 USD
will apply depending on the destination and may vary slightly depending on
currency exchange rates at the time of purchase.  For return travel from
some countries, fares do not include airport and/or departure taxes of up
to $37 USD which may be collected by the foreign government at time of
departure.

Fares do not include Passenger Facility Charges of up to $12 USD per
round-trip which may be collected depending upon the itinerary.

Fares cannot be combined with any other United Airlines or other
airlines' discount, coupon, or promotional offers.
