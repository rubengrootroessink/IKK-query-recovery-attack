TLAB - Tellabs $85.94 (+11.63)(P3W $10.18)

Tellabs is quickly becoming a powerhouse in the Telecom
equipment industry. With their TITAN and CABLESPAN systems,
and its DXX multiplexers, TLAB is raking in the money from
customers among the telephone companies, cable operators,
and government agencies.  Though they faded from news of
their failed merger of Ciena, Tellabs is still a major
player.

Wow!  What a play.  TLAB gave up only $0.44 in Thursday's
turmoil and came smokin' back $5.25 on Friday to close at
$85.94.  Technicals look outstanding with a small
consolidation already taken place; all indicators in
positive territory.  We introduced the play Thursday under
the following logic: TLAB spiked up $13 last Tuesday to $78
on 11 million shares, $8 higher than resistance previously
set at $70.  TLAB drifted back to $74, then spiked $5 to
$79, on average volume of 3.5 million.  Over the previous 3
trading days, it gained in market weakness while giving
back only $.44 in heavy trading in a downright bearish
market - a terrific sign of strength.  3.5 million shares
traded daily; 147 million shares in float; $3.14 per share
in cash; 34% return on equitystrong fundamentals.  We
expect them to announce more contracts in the coming weeks.
Recent news is capturing investors' eyeballs, making for a
good story.  We could find no news on Friday driving the
price; just market recovery and stock momentum.

Monday, Warburg, Dillion Read raised their rating to a
"buy" citing raised earnings per share estimates to $2.35
and $2.93 from $2.30 and $2.85 for 1999 and 2000,
respectively.  They further state, "fundamentals for the
telecom equipment group has improved over the past few
months which improves visibility for Tellabs" and "Our
checks with Tellabs will report fourth quarter 1998 results
slightly better than our $0.58 earnings per share estimate,
as well as having a positive outlook for 1999" (Reuters).
Also, rumors surfaced last week that TLAB was a targeted
buyout/merger candidate, but were quickly squashed.  Not
soon enough, though, to draw investor attention to the
price move.

QCOM - Qualcomm, Inc. $63.88 (+3.63)

QCOM develops, manufactures, markets, licenses, and operates
advanced communications systems and products based on digital
wireless technology. The Company's primary product areas are
the OmniTRACS system (a geostationary satellite-based,
mobile communications system providing two-way data and
position reporting services), CDMA wireless communications
systems and products and, in conjunction with others, the
development of the Globalstar low-earth-orbit (LEO)
satellite communications system.  The company's CDMA technology
has become the dominant wireless transmission standard in the
US and Korea, and is gaining momentum in a host of other
countries.  Demand for CDMA phones is surging as the US
wireless industry is migrating from analog to digital.

In the news last week, QCOM, along with several other
companies, purchased a concession to operate a fixed line
telephone service in Brazil.  QCOM has indicated, in the past,
that it is lobbying China to adopt its CDMA technology.  Since
1990, the average annual growth rate of mobile phone users in
China has been about 160%, according to government figures.
QCOM is building a global presence.  It was also reported on
CNBC on Friday that there is renewed interest in QCOM as a
takeover candidate given the recent acquisition of ATI and the
LU/ASND merger.  If fact, the entire sector is expecting
another round of takeovers given the competitive landscape.

QCOM has been in a basing pattern since last November.  It
actually fell below its 200 day moving average in December, and
then started its current run around the beginning of the year.
QCOM reports earnings on Tuesday just before the close.  As
you know we don't recommend holding over earnings releases, but
QCOM might make an interesting short term trade before the
earnings release.  Depending on the earnings release on
Tuesday, we also like QCOM as a play after the release given
the merger activity in the sector.  After the earnings release,
wait for a direction before initiating a play.

NOK.A  Nokia  $138.59 (+$3.59)

Nokia is a supplier of telecommunications systems and
equipment and is the world's leading maker of cellular
phones. It's telecommunications and mobile phone sales are
growing rapidly, and margins are higher as well. Nokia is
increasing plant capacity to keep up with demand.

We covered Nokia from Dec. 13th until Jan. 10th as both a
split candidate and a momentum play. It climbed steadily
for us into the first week of January, when the stock got
ahead of itself. It had risen a little too quickly due to
enthusiasm for the new Euro and to excitement over the ATI
bids. When it began pulling back from its $142.25 close on
Jan.6th, we feared a correction and became reluctant to
recommend new positions, so we dropped it. With yesterday's
$6.34 rebound, the correction appears to be over, and the
stock remains well above its moving averages, so we are
adding it back to our recommended plays. When NOKA
announced a split in Feb. 1998, a long and steep split run
followed. We have been unable to confirm the expected
earnings release date for this foreign owned stock, but we
will keep you posted, as that is a likely time for a new
split announcement.

Since we dropped it, Nokia has entered the pre-paid mobile
phone market in an agreement with Topp Telecom, Inc., of
Miami. Other recent news on this stock can still be found
in previous newsletters posted on the O.I. website. When
researching NOK.A, be aware that some sites require the dot
and some won't allow it.

MSFT - Microsoft $149.75 (-0.13)(+11.19)(-3.06)(P5W +28.13)

From their own words, "Microsoft Rules." Although it's
current reign is being rocked with revolution, the Evil M-
pire (as some programmers and anti-Internet Explorer
browser patriots call it), has been fighting the Federal
government on anti-trust grounds for months. The line to
take their turn and bad mouth the bully was long and
distinguished. The fact is, MSFT is good at what they do.
They are the world's #1 software company (Y2K compliant or
not!) and their operating systems dominate the PC
landscape.

Extremely volatile, but almost no change from the previous
week.  Price range last week was $136 to $150 on above
average volume for 4 of 5 trading days.  Friday gave us an
$8 gain following the Brazilian downdraft.  CS First Boston
said Microsoft "appears on track" to meet or beat estimate
of 60 cents per share - an increase of 46 percent from the
42 cents in the same quarter last year.  Sales are expected
to increase 21 percent to $4.3 billion.  With conviction,
we still predict a stock split with the earnings
announcement after the close January 19th (MSFT confirmed
this date); only 1 trading day away.  Historically, MSFT
has split like clockwork at $140.  MSFT has expressed
optimism about their future and has every reason to split
the stock.  MSFT is trading just $3 off its all-time high
of $152.50, set the previous week.  Prudential last week
set a price target of $175.  We think their relative price
compared to the market reflects strong investor confidence.
A great play in the making.

Unsavory news release late Thursday: A federal judge
scolded Microsoft Corp. over new contract language
requiring temporary workers to waive any awards from a
pending lawsuit over the software giant's employment
practices (Reuters).  It had no affect on the stock, but
raised eyebrows in the PR department.  Conversely, a new
Microsoft poll shows that 76 percent of American consumers
believe that Microsoft has benefited both U.S. consumers
and the computer software industry (Reuters).  The real
surprise was another press release stating Robert Bork
believes Microsoft should be broken into 3 companies; an
unusual comment from a free market champion, until you
realize he's paid by Netscape to represent them in the
Justice Departments case.  Finally, MSFT appealed the Sun-
Java infringement injunction citing that it believes the
court mistakenly treated the case filed against it by Sun
as a copyright issue, rather than a contract dispute.  We
reiterate, "no material effect on earnings".  Everen
Securities still has their price targets(0-6 months) of
$161 and their long term (6-18 months) of $200

CHKPF  Check Point Software $51.25 (+4.37)(+1.07)

Network break-ins get doused with Check Point Software
Technologies' firewall products -- software that protects
corporate networks from unauthorized access, from both
inside and outside the company. FireWall-1 authenticates
remote users, controls access, and blocks viruses and other
undesirable Web content. Its FloodGate-1 clears up traffic
congestion on crowded Internet and intranet links by
allocating available space to company-defined uses. Check
Point's largest customer is Sun Microsystems' SunSoft, which
accounts for about 20% of sales. Check Point operates
subsidiaries in Europe, North America, and the Pacific Rim.

CHKPF is a company that benefits from the explosion in the
Internet.  As companies increase their use of the web, CHKPF's
services will be needed more and more.  CHKPF has an incredible
record of earning surprises.  Next earnings are scheduled for
January 21st.  Holding over earnings is a risky proposition, but
for those risk takers out there, it might pay off.  There is a
possibility that CHKPF might announce a stock split.  They have
plenty of shares, but have never announced a split in the past.
MACD is positive and CHKPF price is above all moving averages.
Between Tuesday and earnings after the close on Thursday, CHKPF
could have a nice run.

CHKPF, along with other networking security companies, will be
holding a seminar in February. This seminar will outline the
future of the business and the strategies these companies use
and how they can help other companies with their information
security. CHKPF has a consensus growth rate of 37.55%. Watch
for a pullback and hang on for the ride.

PRIA  PRI Automation, INC. $34.50 (+4.87)

PRIA designs, develops, manufactures, and markets factory
automation systems for the cleanroom manufacturing
operations of semi-conductor makers and OEM equipment
suppliers. Last year's $178.2 million in revenues reflect
the big downturn in the semi-conductor industry, but that
is changing. The 1998 glut of chips has been depleted, and
demand is strong again for these products.

After hitting a high of $37.50 in Feb. 1998, PRIA stock had
lost about 75% of its value by the time the market bottomed
in October. However, it has been climbing fairly steadily
ever since, except for a brief correction in December. With
the chip industry recovering, it follows that a company
such as PRIA will benefit. On January 12th, CIBC Oppenheimer
upgraded PRIA to strong buy from buy. This as a momentum
play in an improving industry.  Earnings due out Jan. 28th.

MU  Micron Technology  $71.31 (+7.68)

Micron makes semi-conductor memory products, PCs, circuit
boards, memory modules, and system level assemblies, and
has a market cap. of $17.6 billion.  Revenues for MU=20
declined last year due to lower selling prices of PCs and
semi-conductor products. This was a result of too much
product industry wide and too little demand, but the
company is recovering now, as demand increases.

With the industry gaining steam, market expectations for
Micron's earnings were high in December, and the stock
pulled back when MU did not beat analysts' earnings by a
wide enough margin. However, MU has lately begun climbing
again and gathering momentum. Even in this past week's down
market, the stock looked fairly strong. Chip prices climbed
6% last week as Koreans permanently slashed production and
may actually swing the market from an overproduction last
year to a scarcity in the coming year. The wild card in the
future supply is Taiwan. Already, though, chip prices,
which were $200 a year ago, and fell below $60 in May, have
climbed to near $90. At the same time, sales for PCs and
the chips that go in them are showing strong increases, and
that will eventually show up in MU's bottom line. This is a
momentum play.

CBS Marketwatch screened stocks for 20 different
characteristics and MU turned out in the top group. The
five best characteristics: 1)Strong recent earnings/revenue
growth, 2)Selling at a discount to its growth,
3)Consistently beats analysts expectations, 4)Earnings
estimates continually revised upwards, 5)Short- and long-
term relative strength.

JBL - Jabil Circuit, Inc. $73.88 (-1.00)(+.38)(+2.94)(+3.06)

JBL is the third-largest US manufacturer of circuit board
systems, trailing SCI Systems and Solectron. The company's
products are used in PCs, printers, network hardware, cellular
phones, and cars. JBL's major customers include Hewlett
Packard, 3Com, and Cisco Systems with more than half of its
revenues coming from telecommunications companies.  JBL's
customers use contract manufacturers, like JBL, to save money
and improve production times.  JBL has manufacturing facilities
in Malaysia, Mexico, the UK, and the US.  Insiders own
approximately 41% of the company.

In the news last week, Everen Securities initiated coverage on
JBL with an intermediate term market perform and a long term
outperform.  The press release did note, that in the near-term
they believe that JBL is close to fair value, but in the long
term it should be an outperformer.  The other bit of news that
helped JBL was that Solectron announced a two for one
stock split.  As we have said on more than one occasion, this
industry tends to move together.

Last week, JBL bounced off of its 21 day moving average and
closed right at its 10 day moving average on Friday.  There
also appears to be some support for JBL around $71.  JBL
has been on extended run since last September, and given the
way the sector goes in and out of favor with the Street, you
should keep a close eye on JBL if you are playing it.  If JBL
were to break below $71, in a significant way, we would be very
cautious of the stock.  Also, as with any sector, but more so
with this one, you have to keep an eye on the sector when
playing JBL.

LXK  Lexmark Intl. $98.06 (-2.50)(+.06)(+7.25)(+1.31)

Lexmark has good peripheral vision. Lexmark International
Group is a leading maker of computer printers and related
products, which generate more than 80% of its sales. Its
printer line includes laser printers (designed primarily
for corporate networks and desktops) and ink-jet printers
(for home and business use). Unlike many of its competitors,
Lexmark develops and manufactures it's own printers, which
results in fast product cycle times. The company also makes
supplies for IBM and other name brand printers and typewriters.
Lexmark's products are sold in more than 15,000 retail outlets
in more than 150 countries.

LXK consolidated this last week and is sitting right on its
20-dma. We still like LXK with earnings on the 26th of January.
Remember, holding over earnings is risky. In the case of LXK,
the risk might be justified if they announce a stock split.
Each individual has to weigh out the risk themselves.

LXK hasn't had any news the last few days. These last few
weeks have seen LXK get recommended by many different
professionals as a great stock to own for 1999. Remember,
LXK has had an average earnings surprise of 11.75% over the
last four quarters. This could help propel LXK higher before
earnings on the expectation. There are different earnings dates
listed on the web, but First Call does list the 26th of January.
We will continue to try to get a fixed date from investor
relations.

EMC - EMC Corporation $100.06 (+6.50)(+8.56)(+3.38)(+.13)

EMC is a Fortune 500 company that designs, manufactures,
markets an supports high performance storage products.  The
company's products store retrieve, manage, protect and share
information from all major computing environments, including
UNIX, Windows NT and mainframe platforms.  EMC markets its
memory products under the name Symmetrix.  EMC and its
enterprise storage systems have developed a clear cut
technological edge over its competition.  The company has been
able to successfully leverage its leadership position in the
mainframe storage area into the lucrative, faster growing open
systems market.

There really wasn't any news last week on EMC.  We think the
real story happened on Thursday, when the NASDAQ was down and
EMC went up.  This suggests that there are still a lot of
buyers who want EMC stock.  This was confirmed by the move EMC
made on Friday.  We continue to read  articles that discuss EMC
being in model portfolios of 20 to 30 growth stocks.  There was
an article in MSN MoneyCentral about EMC being one of the top
30 growth stocks.  EMC has been, and is continuing to be, a
great momentum stock.

EMC took off again on Friday.  It set a new 52 week high on
Friday, and closed near the high.  As we discussed above, EMC
is one of those stocks that people keep buying.  As long as
there are buyers of the stock, we believe it will continue with
it's momentum.  EMC is also a split candidate.  We know we keep
saying this, but as it continues to move up, it only increases
the probability of a split.  A year ago this last November EMC
split at around $63 after a strong move.  FYI - EMC reports
earnings before the open on 1/26.

XIRC  Xircom Inc. $39.88 (+1.38)(+4.50)(+1.25)

Xircom makes adapters that connect portable PCs to corporate
networks, the Internet, and commercial online services. The
company's products include adapter/modem cards (CreditCard
Ethernet+Modem), network adapters for portable PCs (Pocket
Ethernet Adapter, Pocket Token Ring Adapter), and modem-only
PC cards (CreditCard Modem). Xircom sells its products to
original equipment manufacturers and through a worldwide
network of distributors, value-added resellers, and computer
retailers. Over half of its income is from foreign sales.
Intel owns 11% of Xircom; chairman and CEO Dirk Gates owns
about 5%.

XIRC is expecting to announce earnings that are 300% higher
than the same quarter last year.  With the large earning
surprises XIRC has had the last four quarter, a nice run
could develop into earnings. Though a split isn't likely,
the company has enough shares to announced one. There is
no split history for XIRC.  XIRC reached a new 52-week high
on Friday when it hit $40.50.

XIRC was recently selected as one of the best mobile PC cards.
Its product will be competing with 3COM and a few others for
the best mobile PC card.  This award ceremony is put on the
Mobility Awards. 3COM is one of the biggest competitors of XIRC.

TLAB - Tellabs $85.94 (+11.63)(P3W $10.18)

Tellabs is quickly becoming a powerhouse in the Telecom
equipment industry. With their TITAN and CABLESPAN systems,
and its DXX multiplexers, TLAB is raking in the money from
customers among the telephone companies, cable operators,
and government agencies.  Though they faded from news of
their failed merger of Ciena, Tellabs is still a major
player.

Wow!  What a play.  TLAB gave up only $0.44 in Thursday's
turmoil and came smokin' back $5.25 on Friday to close at
$85.94.  Technicals look outstanding with a small
consolidation already taken place; all indicators in
positive territory.  We introduced the play Thursday under
the following logic: TLAB spiked up $13 last Tuesday to $78
on 11 million shares, $8 higher than resistance previously
set at $70.  TLAB drifted back to $74, then spiked $5 to
$79, on average volume of 3.5 million.  Over the previous 3
trading days, it gained in market weakness while giving
back only $.44 in heavy trading in a downright bearish
market - a terrific sign of strength.  3.5 million shares
traded daily; 147 million shares in float; $3.14 per share
in cash; 34% return on equitystrong fundamentals.  We
expect them to announce more contracts in the coming weeks.
Recent news is capturing investors' eyeballs, making for a
good story.  We could find no news on Friday driving the
price; just market recovery and stock momentum.

Monday, Warburg, Dillion Read raised their rating to a
"buy" citing raised earnings per share estimates to $2.35
and $2.93 from $2.30 and $2.85 for 1999 and 2000,
respectively.  They further state, "fundamentals for the
telecom equipment group has improved over the past few
months which improves visibility for Tellabs" and "Our
checks with Tellabs will report fourth quarter 1998 results
slightly better than our $0.58 earnings per share estimate,
as well as having a positive outlook for 1999" (Reuters).
Also, rumors surfaced last week that TLAB was a targeted
buyout/merger candidate, but were quickly squashed.  Not
soon enough, though, to draw investor attention to the
price move.

QCOM - Qualcomm, Inc. $63.88 (+3.63)

QCOM develops, manufactures, markets, licenses, and operates
advanced communications systems and products based on digital
wireless technology. The Company's primary product areas are
the OmniTRACS system (a geostationary satellite-based,
mobile communications system providing two-way data and
position reporting services), CDMA wireless communications
systems and products and, in conjunction with others, the
development of the Globalstar low-earth-orbit (LEO)
satellite communications system.  The company's CDMA technology
has become the dominant wireless transmission standard in the
US and Korea, and is gaining momentum in a host of other
countries.  Demand for CDMA phones is surging as the US
wireless industry is migrating from analog to digital.

In the news last week, QCOM, along with several other
companies, purchased a concession to operate a fixed line
telephone service in Brazil.  QCOM has indicated, in the past,
that it is lobbying China to adopt its CDMA technology.  Since
1990, the average annual growth rate of mobile phone users in
China has been about 160%, according to government figures.
QCOM is building a global presence.  It was also reported on
CNBC on Friday that there is renewed interest in QCOM as a
takeover candidate given the recent acquisition of ATI and the
LU/ASND merger.  If fact, the entire sector is expecting
another round of takeovers given the competitive landscape.

QCOM has been in a basing pattern since last November.  It
actually fell below its 200 day moving average in December, and
then started its current run around the beginning of the year.
QCOM reports earnings on Tuesday just before the close.  As
you know we don't recommend holding over earnings releases, but
QCOM might make an interesting short term trade before the
earnings release.  Depending on the earnings release on
Tuesday, we also like QCOM as a play after the release given
the merger activity in the sector.  After the earnings release,
wait for a direction before initiating a play.

NOK.A  Nokia  $138.59 (+$3.59)

Nokia is a supplier of telecommunications systems and
equipment and is the world's leading maker of cellular
phones. It's telecommunications and mobile phone sales are
growing rapidly, and margins are higher as well. Nokia is
increasing plant capacity to keep up with demand.

We covered Nokia from Dec. 13th until Jan. 10th as both a
split candidate and a momentum play. It climbed steadily
for us into the first week of January, when the stock got
ahead of itself. It had risen a little too quickly due to
enthusiasm for the new Euro and to excitement over the ATI
bids. When it began pulling back from its $142.25 close on
Jan.6th, we feared a correction and became reluctant to
recommend new positions, so we dropped it. With yesterday's
$6.34 rebound, the correction appears to be over, and the
stock remains well above its moving averages, so we are
adding it back to our recommended plays. When NOKA
announced a split in Feb. 1998, a long and steep split run
followed. We have been unable to confirm the expected
earnings release date for this foreign owned stock, but we
will keep you posted, as that is a likely time for a new
split announcement.

Since we dropped it, Nokia has entered the pre-paid mobile
phone market in an agreement with Topp Telecom, Inc., of
Miami. Other recent news on this stock can still be found
in previous newsletters posted on the O.I. website. When
researching NOK.A, be aware that some sites require the dot
and some won't allow it.

Software - Sector
*******************************************
MSFT - Microsoft $149.75 (-0.13)(+11.19)(-3.06)(P5W +28.13)

From their own words, "Microsoft Rules." Although it's
current reign is being rocked with revolution, the Evil M-
pire (as some programmers and anti-Internet Explorer
browser patriots call it), has been fighting the Federal
government on anti-trust grounds for months. The line to
take their turn and bad mouth the bully was long and
distinguished. The fact is, MSFT is good at what they do.
They are the world's #1 software company (Y2K compliant or
not!) and their operating systems dominate the PC
landscape.

Extremely volatile, but almost no change from the previous
week.  Price range last week was $136 to $150 on above
average volume for 4 of 5 trading days.  Friday gave us an
$8 gain following the Brazilian downdraft.  CS First Boston
said Microsoft "appears on track" to meet or beat estimate
of 60 cents per share - an increase of 46 percent from the
42 cents in the same quarter last year.  Sales are expected
to increase 21 percent to $4.3 billion.  With conviction,
we still predict a stock split with the earnings
announcement after the close January 19th (MSFT confirmed
this date); only 1 trading day away.  Historically, MSFT
has split like clockwork at $140.  MSFT has expressed
optimism about their future and has every reason to split
the stock.  MSFT is trading just $3 off its all-time high
of $152.50, set the previous week.  Prudential last week
set a price target of $175.  We think their relative price
compared to the market reflects strong investor confidence.
A great play in the making.

Unsavory news release late Thursday: A federal judge
scolded Microsoft Corp. over new contract language
requiring temporary workers to waive any awards from a
pending lawsuit over the software giant's employment
practices (Reuters).  It had no affect on the stock, but
raised eyebrows in the PR department.  Conversely, a new
Microsoft poll shows that 76 percent of American consumers
believe that Microsoft has benefited both U.S. consumers
and the computer software industry (Reuters).  The real
surprise was another press release stating Robert Bork
believes Microsoft should be broken into 3 companies; an
unusual comment from a free market champion, until you
realize he's paid by Netscape to represent them in the
Justice Departments case.  Finally, MSFT appealed the Sun-
Java infringement injunction citing that it believes the
court mistakenly treated the case filed against it by Sun
as a copyright issue, rather than a contract dispute.  We
reiterate, "no material effect on earnings".  Everen
Securities still has their price targets(0-6 months) of
$161 and their long term (6-18 months) of $200

CHKPF  Check Point Software $51.25 (+4.37)(+1.07)

Network break-ins get doused with Check Point Software
Technologies' firewall products -- software that protects
corporate networks from unauthorized access, from both
inside and outside the company. FireWall-1 authenticates
remote users, controls access, and blocks viruses and other
undesirable Web content. Its FloodGate-1 clears up traffic
congestion on crowded Internet and intranet links by
allocating available space to company-defined uses. Check
Point's largest customer is Sun Microsystems' SunSoft, which
accounts for about 20% of sales. Check Point operates
subsidiaries in Europe, North America, and the Pacific Rim.

CHKPF is a company that benefits from the explosion in the
Internet.  As companies increase their use of the web, CHKPF's
services will be needed more and more.  CHKPF has an incredible
record of earning surprises.  Next earnings are scheduled for
January 21st.  Holding over earnings is a risky proposition, but
for those risk takers out there, it might pay off.  There is a
possibility that CHKPF might announce a stock split.  They have
plenty of shares, but have never announced a split in the past.
MACD is positive and CHKPF price is above all moving averages.
Between Tuesday and earnings after the close on Thursday, CHKPF
could have a nice run.

CHKPF, along with other networking security companies, will be
holding a seminar in February. This seminar will outline the
future of the business and the strategies these companies use
and how they can help other companies with their information
security. CHKPF has a consensus growth rate of 37.55%. Watch
for a pullback and hang on for the ride.

PRIA  PRI Automation, INC. $34.50 (+4.87)

PRIA designs, develops, manufactures, and markets factory
automation systems for the cleanroom manufacturing
operations of semi-conductor makers and OEM equipment
suppliers. Last year's $178.2 million in revenues reflect
the big downturn in the semi-conductor industry, but that
is changing. The 1998 glut of chips has been depleted, and
demand is strong again for these products.

After hitting a high of $37.50 in Feb. 1998, PRIA stock had
lost about 75% of its value by the time the market bottomed
in October. However, it has been climbing fairly steadily
ever since, except for a brief correction in December. With
the chip industry recovering, it follows that a company
such as PRIA will benefit. On January 12th, CIBC Oppenheimer
upgraded PRIA to strong buy from buy. This as a momentum
play in an improving industry.  Earnings due out Jan. 28th.

MU  Micron Technology  $71.31 (+7.68)

Micron makes semi-conductor memory products, PCs, circuit
boards, memory modules, and system level assemblies, and
has a market cap. of $17.6 billion.  Revenues for MU=20
declined last year due to lower selling prices of PCs and
semi-conductor products. This was a result of too much
product industry wide and too little demand, but the
company is recovering now, as demand increases.

With the industry gaining steam, market expectations for
Micron's earnings were high in December, and the stock
pulled back when MU did not beat analysts' earnings by a
wide enough margin. However, MU has lately begun climbing
again and gathering momentum. Even in this past week's down
market, the stock looked fairly strong. Chip prices climbed
6% last week as Koreans permanently slashed production and
may actually swing the market from an overproduction last
year to a scarcity in the coming year. The wild card in the
future supply is Taiwan. Already, though, chip prices,
which were $200 a year ago, and fell below $60 in May, have
climbed to near $90. At the same time, sales for PCs and
the chips that go in them are showing strong increases, and
that will eventually show up in MU's bottom line. This is a
momentum play.

CBS Marketwatch screened stocks for 20 different
characteristics and MU turned out in the top group. The
five best characteristics: 1)Strong recent earnings/revenue
growth, 2)Selling at a discount to its growth,
3)Consistently beats analysts expectations, 4)Earnings
estimates continually revised upwards, 5)Short- and long-
term relative strength.

JBL - Jabil Circuit, Inc. $73.88 (-1.00)(+.38)(+2.94)(+3.06)

JBL is the third-largest US manufacturer of circuit board
systems, trailing SCI Systems and Solectron. The company's
products are used in PCs, printers, network hardware, cellular
phones, and cars. JBL's major customers include Hewlett
Packard, 3Com, and Cisco Systems with more than half of its
revenues coming from telecommunications companies.  JBL's
customers use contract manufacturers, like JBL, to save money
and improve production times.  JBL has manufacturing facilities
in Malaysia, Mexico, the UK, and the US.  Insiders own
approximately 41% of the company.

In the news last week, Everen Securities initiated coverage on
JBL with an intermediate term market perform and a long term
outperform.  The press release did note, that in the near-term
they believe that JBL is close to fair value, but in the long
term it should be an outperformer.  The other bit of news that
helped JBL was that Solectron announced a two for one
stock split.  As we have said on more than one occasion, this
industry tends to move together.

Last week, JBL bounced off of its 21 day moving average and
closed right at its 10 day moving average on Friday.  There
also appears to be some support for JBL around $71.  JBL
has been on extended run since last September, and given the
way the sector goes in and out of favor with the Street, you
should keep a close eye on JBL if you are playing it.  If JBL
were to break below $71, in a significant way, we would be very
cautious of the stock.  Also, as with any sector, but more so

LXK  Lexmark Intl. $98.06 (-2.50)(+.06)(+7.25)(+1.31)

Lexmark has good peripheral vision. Lexmark International
Group is a leading maker of computer printers and related
products, which generate more than 80% of its sales. Its
printer line includes laser printers (designed primarily
for corporate networks and desktops) and ink-jet printers
(for home and business use). Unlike many of its competitors,
Lexmark develops and manufactures it's own printers, which
results in fast product cycle times. The company also makes
supplies for IBM and other name brand printers and typewriters.
Lexmark's products are sold in more than 15,000 retail outlets
in more than 150 countries.

LXK consolidated this last week and is sitting right on its
20-dma. We still like LXK with earnings on the 26th of January.
Remember, holding over earnings is risky. In the case of LXK,
the risk might be justified if they announce a stock split.
Each individual has to weigh out the risk themselves.

LXK hasn't had any news the last few days. These last few
weeks have seen LXK get recommended by many different
professionals as a great stock to own for 1999. Remember,
LXK has had an average earnings surprise of 11.75% over the
last four quarters. This could help propel LXK higher before
earnings on the expectation. There are different earnings dates
listed on the web, but First Call does list the 26th of January.
We will continue to try to get a fixed date from investor
relations.

EMC - EMC Corporation $100.06 (+6.50)(+8.56)(+3.38)(+.13)

EMC is a Fortune 500 company that designs, manufactures,
markets an supports high performance storage products.  The
company's products store retrieve, manage, protect and share
information from all major computing environments, including
UNIX, Windows NT and mainframe platforms.  EMC markets its
memory products under the name Symmetrix.  EMC and its
enterprise storage systems have developed a clear cut
technological edge over its competition.  The company has been
able to successfully leverage its leadership position in the
mainframe storage area into the lucrative, faster growing open
systems market.

There really wasn't any news last week on EMC.  We think the
real story happened on Thursday, when the NASDAQ was down and
EMC went up.  This suggests that there are still a lot of
buyers who want EMC stock.  This was confirmed by the move EMC
made on Friday.  We continue to read  articles that discuss EMC
being in model portfolios of 20 to 30 growth stocks.  There was
an article in MSN MoneyCentral about EMC being one of the top
30 growth stocks.  EMC has been, and is continuing to be, a
great momentum stock.

EMC took off again on Friday.  It set a new 52 week high on
Friday, and closed near the high.  As we discussed above, EMC
is one of those stocks that people keep buying.  As long as
there are buyers of the stock, we believe it will continue with
it's momentum.  EMC is also a split candidate.  We know we keep
saying this, but as it continues to move up, it only increases
the probability of a split.  A year ago this last November EMC
split at around $63 after a strong move.  FYI - EMC reports
earnings before the open on 1/26.

XIRC  Xircom Inc. $39.88 (+1.38)(+4.50)(+1.25)

Xircom makes adapters that connect portable PCs to corporate
networks, the Internet, and commercial online services. The
company's products include adapter/modem cards (CreditCard
Ethernet+Modem), network adapters for portable PCs (Pocket
Ethernet Adapter, Pocket Token Ring Adapter), and modem-only
PC cards (CreditCard Modem). Xircom sells its products to
original equipment manufacturers and through a worldwide
network of distributors, value-added resellers, and computer
retailers. Over half of its income is from foreign sales.
Intel owns 11% of Xircom; chairman and CEO Dirk Gates owns
about 5%.

XIRC is expecting to announce earnings that are 300% higher
than the same quarter last year.  With the large earning
surprises XIRC has had the last four quarter, a nice run
could develop into earnings. Though a split isn't likely,
the company has enough shares to announced one. There is
no split history for XIRC.  XIRC reached a new 52-week high
on Friday when it hit $40.50.

XIRC was recently selected as one of the best mobile PC cards.
Its product will be competing with 3COM and a few others for
the best mobile PC card.  This award ceremony is put on the
Mobility Awards. 3COM is one of the biggest competitors of XIRC.

*****************************************
Trading lessons...

This week we are going discuss one of the many pitfalls that you
will eventually encounter as a trader; Incorrect Information...

Occasionally, we will discover an error in a stock or option quote
and usually it comes to us "the hard way". Last week, we offered
a position on Reliance Bancorp (RELY) and it turns out that the
option quoted was for another stock. It was not a research error
or miss-type, just erroneous quote information provided to the
trading public. One of our faithful readers had the unfortunate
experience of buying into this play on the assumption that the
option existed. We received permission to reprint portions of his
remarks to educate our readers. Here is the general narrative;

"I did my 'due diligence' on the options play with Reliance
Bancorp but like a growing number of people this was all handled
on-line with me as the only human in the food chain willing to
take any chances. Oddly though, I did speak to two other people
in this and got an interesting mix of answers.

I used (two common brokerages; names deleted) for my information,
perhaps using two separate entities was my downfall here. One
stated just as you did that there was a Reliance, FEB25-Call at
the same bid as you published. If fact, it showed an array of
options for Reliance. However, come to find out they were Verio.

I then bought shares of Reliance on-line through another broker in
my IRA with the intention of selling calls against them the next
day. When I entered the ticker symbol to 'sell calls to open', I
was greeted by a statement about Verio. Calling the broker, I was
told that the ticker symbol was in fact for Verio but only the Feb.
call. I then contacted the option trading desk and found that the
ticker symbol belonged to Verio and there were no options on RELY
at all. I was fooled by the apparent presence of options at one
brokerage, which tells me that I need to do all my research
through the top name brokerage."

The reader went on to point out that; "It turned out to be the
systems that were fouled up and not the analysis, all information
that is received on-line or through humans should be verified
before investing...I sure plan to do so from now on!"

Words of wisdom for sure!

-ROI is equal to the profit (or loss) divided by the cost-basis.
 Monthly ROI represents the return on a monthly basis.
 Example: a 10% return in 20 days equals 15.2% ROI for a month).
-Margin is not used in any calculations.
-Profit/Loss Column: Asterisk indicates stock price above strike
 price and should be called.  Stock that will not be called is
 assumed sold at current price (for tracking purposes).

*** LOSING PLAYS ***

Determining when to exit a play is a matter of personal preference
but we strongly recommended closing any play that falls more than
20% below the initial cost-basis. Some positions may eventually
become profitable but it is generally more productive to exit a
losing play and move your capital into another prospective trade.

NAKED PUT SECTION FOR JANUARY 17, 1999
******************************************************************
This month, the naked-put portfolio performed very well. Most of
the success was due to the January effect and the bullish movement
of the market after the new year's holiday. Some of the more
successful plays were Internet and Pharmaceutical positions. In
fact, a number of Internet stocks continue to climb as if the sky
had no ceiling. We did have one negative position. Zila fell on
news that Federal advisers recommended against approval of Oratest,
a test to help see cancerous lesions in the mouth. The play should
have been closed for a $0.75 loss.

Brazilian woes continue...

The market is being subdued by the deteriorating situation in
Brazil and no one knows whether this virus will spread like the
Asian Flu. It all stems from the fact that the current world
markets are very susceptible to global meltdown and the closest
thing to a controlling entity is the US government. A serious
situation like the South American financial turmoil won't go away
quickly and although the floating of the Brazilian 'real' should
help the situation in the short-term, it may not prevent trouble
from spreading to other countries. Our economy has never been out
of control but we now face a period of potentially disappointing
earnings reports which will definitely have an effect on the U.S.
stock market in the coming weeks. Good Luck!

SPLN as one of 4 top Internet stocks to buy now! A steady climb
since mid-Oct and a recent gap-up when the company said it will
post outstanding Q4 revenues, up 90% from a year ago. CBS's new
record-breaking IPO (Marketwatch.com) probably helps this one!

SRCM - SourceMedia  $19.75

SRCM is a provider of information and programming through
the company's proprietary digital operating systems to mass
market consumers. Customers subscribe to Source Media audio
content and have it featured on their web site. The company
launched audio programming with Broadcast.com and says the
Internet audio means it has content on PC's, cable TV and
telephones. A rumored deal with American Online may also be
causing some of the buying pressure and the stock has good
technical support around $15.

VIRS - Triangle Pharm.  $14.13

Triangle Pharmaceuticals is a pharmaceutical company engaged
in the development of new drug candidates primarily in the
antiviral area. Still playing this stock again as it has exited
the tip of the isosceles triangle formation and started to move
higher. Dec 15 entered into definitive purchase agreements to
sell 4.8m newly issued shares of stock to selected investors for
a price of $10. Technically still neutral (basing) to bullish.

Wavephore is a media content integrator and architect of digital

common stock to a current institutional shareholder at a premium,
thus eliminating any near term financing issues. Also provided a
warrant to the investor to acquire an additional 250,000 shares
at $10.66. The funds will be used for working capital and should
fund existing operations beyond 1999. Good support around $8.

PICKS WE DROPPED THIS WEEK
*****************************************
Remember that historically, when we drop a pick it will go up
10 to 15% the very next week. It is part of Murphy's Law.
Just because we drop a stock as a pick does not mean we are
advocating a "sell" on any position you have. We are simply
dropping our recommendation as a new play. Existing plays
can and do continue on and are usually profitable.
*****************************************

CALLS:

LOW $50.63(-4.06) We are dropping LOW this week. They have
taken a fall and we don't see any catalyst to continue the
move up.  LOW's has had a nice run. Earnings aren't until
February and we feel there are other picks that will out-
perform.  We are not saying those holding LOW's should sell,
every investor makes their own decision, we just feel it
isn't worthy of a new purchase at this point.

PUTS:

CBE - Cooper Industries  $44.81  (2.69)
Stock rallied sharply on Friday (1/15) after retesting prior
support at $43. Pinnacle dropping CBE after reaching price

NETWORKING - Sector
***************************************
CSCO - Cisco Systems $101.69 (-5.00)(+13.88)(-1.38)(P6W +29.49)

Cisco is the leading networker and is expected to help
build the next generation Internet. Their goal is to allow
people to access or transfer information without regard to
differences in time, place or type of computer systems,
voice or data.  About 85% of the routers used to decipher
and direct data traffic on the Internet are made by Cisco.

Panic, over-reaction, reality. That best describes CSCO's
trade pattern last week.  We're adding CSCO back after
dropping it from Tuesday's publication.  The market
realized that Lucent's acquisition of Ascend is not the end
of the world for CSCO, sending CSCO back up from its knee-
jerk/market induced sell off. "Often it's the very best
employees who approach Cisco after a takeover.  "That's
wonderful for us and bad for the other guy," said Larry
Lang of CSCO's business services division.  CSCO will
provide the equipment needed for AT&T to offer
TV/phone/internet/data services through (what will be) it's
TCI division.  CSCO is truly leading the development of the
Internet by helping cable and phone companies complete "the
last mile", or the distance between the cable in the street
an your home.  Also making news, this from Newswire, "Cisco
Systems to Invest $6 Million in Technical Support for
China; Technical Assistance Center and Additional Support
Options to Benefit Channel Partners and Customers."

The big picture is that CSCO is due for another split now
that the price is over $100.  Historically, their split
range is $80-$100.  While they have enough shares
outstanding to complete another 3:2 split, a 2:1 would
require the shareholder's to approve more shares.  Next
earnings announcement is scheduled for 2/2 (company
verified); perhaps then we'll get the announcement.  Though
up to $108 the week before, CSCO couldn't hold the gains and
fell with LU/ASND and Brazil news.  Nice recovery back over
$101 on Friday after falling as low as $89 in Wednesday's
sell-off.  A better entry is now available.  Look for
market direction and make your move.

AOL - America Online $146.50 (+0.00)(-8.63)(+18.50)(P5W+65.06)

America Online is the largest online Internet access
service in the world.  Membership now exceeds 15 million
users.  Its Chairman, Steve Case, said more new users
signed up with AOL on Christmas Day than any other day in
the company's history.  With estimates of 16 million users
by the year 2000 and growing advertising revenues AOL has
been called the blue chip of the Internets. (If only they
could get their mail problem resolved!)

Given Internet weakness last week, it's a wonder AOL
finished even from the previous week.  AOL traded between
$130.00 and $167.  What action!  It finished Friday up
$2.00 on light volume, faring well against significant
losses on other 1st tier Internet stocks.  Consolidation may
be nearing an end as we approach earnings.  At these price
levels, AOL is again well over its historical $120 split
range, though rumors seem to have died for an immediate
announcement.  Currently they have 1.8 bln shares
authorized.  That's enough for a 3:1 split, but a 2:1 is
more likely.  Earnings are on January 27th (company
confirmed).  Look for the split announcement then along
with surprise earnings (as usual).  For the next couple of
days, target shooting your entry may be a safer play.  As
always, confirm market direction first.

Making news this week, AOL stated they expect to close the
Netscape deal by the end of April.  Also, they are
partnering a deal with Bell Atlantic to bring AOL service
at DSL speeds (Digital Subscriber Line-1.5 megs of
bandwidth) to Bell Atlantic customers, putting them in
competition with @Home, another successful cable internet
access service.  DSL service could be available by mid-
Summer (at less than $20 additional per month) and will
cover 15 million homes by the year 2000.  Potential revenue
is huge.  Other DSL agreements are being discussed with
other Baby-Bell regional carriers. Never failing to come up
with new marketing ideas to get subscribers, AOL is taking
its cue from Amway, Mary Kay and Tupperware, and will begin
marketing it's AOL Select service through a multi level
marketing organization called Monument Communications,
based in McLean, VA.

Still an Internet stock.

YHOO  Yahoo! Inc. $317.00 (-26.63)(+106.69)

Yahoo! Inc. is a global Internet media company that offers
a network of branded World Wide Web programming that serves
millions of users daily. As the first online navigational
guide to the Web, WWW.YAHOO.COM is the single largest guide
in terms of traffic, advertising, household and business user
reach, and is one of the most recognized brands associated
with the Internet. The company provides targeted Internet
resources and communications services for a broad range of
audiences, based on demographic, key-subject and geographic
interests.

We are adding YHOO back to the pick list with a precaution:
Wait for a positive confirmation!  YHOO is down over $125 from
its 52-week high.  Of all the Internet stocks, YHOO is the
closest thing to a blue-chip, except for AOL in this list also.
We like the chances that YHOO will turn strongly positive over
the next few weeks leading into it's split.  YHOO showed a classic
example of high expectations when it announced great earnings and
a stock split, yet has fallen drastically.  The internets have
played this game before.  They go in spurts, consolidate and then
take off again.  This is a risky play, but those that are willing
to take the risk, are often rewarded with extraordinary gains.

There are a lot of companies out there trying to duplicate the
success YHOO has had with it's web site.  Many on-line shopping
sites have used YHOO as a model.  Though this seems like it
might eat into YHOO's profits, the fact is that YHOO still leads
the pack.  The more awareness there is for online services, the
more hits YHOO will receive.  These added hits turn into added
advertising revenue which turns into more profits.  Ultimately,
more profits means higher stock prices.

*******************************************
WCOM - MCIWorldCom $75.06 (+0.06)(+3.25)(+1.62)(P4W +7.69)

Telecommunications behemoth, MCIWorldCom, is the recent
offspring between a marriage of formerly #2 long distance
provider MCI and #4 provider WorldCom.  Now the newly
formed giant of giants is duking it out with AT&T as they
stake their claim in the local phone service, international
service, cellular, paging, and Internet access arenas.
WorldCom's $37 billion purchase of MCI last September
qualifies it the 7th largest merger or acquisition in 1998.
WCOM is one of the largest Internet backbone providers in
the world.  If you're reading this letter, somewhere in the
transmission, WCOM fiber brought it to you.

Friday, WCOM gained over $4 from Friday's trading low on
heavy trading - nice comeback.  WCOM is showing a lot of
relative strength.  In last week's action, profits were
shaken out and buyers stepped in.  Though WCOM dipped below
support of $70, they didn't stay there long and finished
each day at no less than $72.  It appears to have
consolidated, and having bounced off its moving average,
should continue upward, market permitting.  Slight
resistance is $76 with harder resistance at $79.  Any
volume or overall market strength should push it right
through.  The markets were not disappointed when WCOM
backed away from bidding on Air Touch, which helped WCOM's
recovery.  We're still big believers in Bernie Ebbers,
WCOM's "awe shucks" chairman.

The big news last week, the U.S. General Services
Administration selected MCI WorldCom to provide long-
distance telephone, data and video telecommunications
services to Federal government agencies worldwide in the
second and final round of its multi(5)-billion dollar
FTS2001 competition.  WCOM is in high-bandwidth content
delivery tests with AOL, which should be successful and
more fully implemented through Bell Atlantic and SBC's DSL
services. With recent court rulings preventing the baby
bells from entering the long distance market in their home
areas, 20% growth in voice traffic and 100% growth in data
traffic every 4 months (!!! Gilder Technology Report) this
spells good news and continued earnings growth for the big
3 long distance providers.

T - AT&T $84.25 (-0.81)(+9.31)(+1.19)(+1.56)(P4W +12.06)

AT&T, the mother of all phone companies isn't just a long
distance company any more. Through growth and acquisition,
they now provide data transmission, video tele-
conferencing, PCS/wireless/cellular, Internet, paging and
local phone services via microwave, fiber and copper
infrastructure throughout the U.S. and international
markets.  Their annual revenues in excess of $55 billion
dwarf their nearest competitor, MCIWorldCom, by 5 times.
Their 1998 acquisition of TCG (formerly Teleport
Communications Group, the nations largest competitive local
exchange carrier) and IBM's data services division will add
substantially to their revenues.  Pending a merger with
cable giant, TCI, revenues could grow even more.  Michael
Armstrong, AT&T's CEO, has investors believing that AT&T is
no longer a copper wire dinosaur heading-up the telecom
extinction list.

Great defensive play in the face of market woes last week.
AT&T dipped just below $81 after the open Wednesday, it's
low trading point of the week, but finished up strongly at
$84.75.  Friday's recovery of $2.13 after Thursday's
nosedive to $82.12 came as investor's realized the sell-off
was overdone.  Merrill Lynch upgraded the week before last
to "Long Term Buy".  Technicals are a bit weak in light of
market conditions, but should recover with any market
strength.  Still, the big news:  3:2 stock split to occur
when the TCI deal closes around the end of March (no firm
date yet-we'll let you know the details when available), $4
billion stock repurchase (about 2.7% of shares in float at
current levels) and increased earnings estimates.  With
some of the profits shaken out, a better entry is possible,
but confirm direction before playing.

Not much price moving news this week (other than Brazil).
The week before last, AT&T got the green light to merge
with TCI thus creating a huge bandwidth pipe (lots of
transmission capacity) over "the last Mile" or that short
distance between the street and your phone jack.  It's
estimated that it costs $1200 per home for a typical
utility to trench and install any transmission equipment.
That's why even though the fiber optic cable runs down your
street, you can't yet access it.  It's too expensive to get
it to you.  Soon, you'll be able to bypass that fiber in
favor of AT&T/TCI cable.  It's already there.  Translation:
increased revenues.

ATI  AirTouch Communications $83.38 (+4.38)(+6.56)(+4.56)(+5.19)

AirTouch Communications provides wireless communications to nearly
14 million customers in the US and in 11 countries in Asia and
Europe. Its operations include cellular telephone service (#2 in
the US, after AT&T), paging, and personal communications service
through PrimeCo, its joint venture with Bell Atlantic. AirTouch has
joint ventures in Europe and Asia, including Portugal (Telecel)
and Sweden (Europolitan), where the cellular market is growing
rapidly. It holds a minority stake in the Globalstar satellite
network, which is scheduled to begin providing worldwide digital
phone communications in 1999.

Well, it is finally done. ATI is merging with Vodaphone. The
combined company, to be known as Vodafone AirTouch Plc, will
reach nearly one billion people in 23 countries on four
continents. Serving over 23 million proportionate cellular
and PCS customers, Vodafone AirTouch will be the largest
wireless company in the world by a substantial margin. The
merger is expected to benefit employees, customers and
stockholders. The deal puts ATI shares value at $97 based on
the January 15th close.

If you are not already in ATI, it's too late. ATI will gap open
on Monday.  We will wait and see how the reaction is after
Monday to decide if we should keep ATI long-term.  The only
reason we might keep it is because the deal involves 1 share
of ATI for .5 shares of VOD's ADR share price (plus $9 in cash
per share).  Thus if VOD continues to move up, ATI should
continue to move up too.  ATI is scheduled to announce earnings
on the 22nd of January.

Options will be out of date on the open Tuesday (that means
anything we quote today will probably be $10 too cheap by
Tuesday).  If we keep ATI on Tuesday, we will update the
current option prices.

LU  Lucent Technologies $110.25 (-5.06)(+5.31)(-2.12)

Lucent Technologies, Inc. is one of the world's leading
designers, developers and manufacturers of telecommunications
systems, software and products. The Company is a global market
leader in the sale of public telecommunications systems, and
is a supplier of systems or software to most of the worlds
largest network operators. They are also a global market
leader in the sale of business communications systems and
in the sale of microelectronic components for communications
applications to manufacturers of communications systems and
computers.

LU is back!!! After trading as low as $96.00 three days ago,
LU took back over $4 of those losses.  LU took a hit with the
news it was in talks with Ascend.  When the news became reality,
LU has firmed and is heading higher into earnings on the 21st.
LU says the merger will not affect earnings in 1999 and should
help earnings in 2000. It seems the merger is viewed as
positive by the public since LU has trended higher since the
news became official.  There is a possibility that LU could
announce a split with earnings, but the more likely time will
be after the shareholders meeting in February.

Lucent announced a new product for radio.  Lucent Digital
Radio's advancement, called Multi-Streaming, is based on
state-of-the-art capabilities in audio and wireless channel
coding technologies from Lucent's Bell Labs, and allows for
the best-quality FM audio to be delivered over a wide coverage
area, even under impaired channel conditions.

COMBINATION PLAYS - MARKET RECAP -Boom or Bust?
******************************************************************

U.S. stocks rallied on Friday, snapping back from the problem of
Brazilian currency devaluation as investors showed new confidence
in the market. The Dow closed up 220 points at 9340.55 and the
Nasdaq was up 71 points at 2348.21. Internet traders were focused
on Marketwatch.com as shares surged 473% and markets around the
world benefited from Brazil's move to let the inflation-busting
real float. The question is: Will the enthusiasm fade next week?

Our new spread plays were all available at favorable prices. The
first candidate was CIEN and a debit price of $3.50 (FEB12C/17C)
was easily attained in the morning trading. SDTI and SRCM went in
different directions but both were still playable. The credit for
the SDTI spread (FEB17P/20P) was slightly less than expected at
$0.50 and SRCM (FEB15P/17P) was right in line at $0.75. SRCM is
primarily a merger-speculation play and without news or continued
rumors, the stock price will drop. Watch it closely! AAPL was our
leg-in play and as recommended, we started with a long position
(FEB35P) at $1.12 and used the afternoon's downward momentum to
increase the price of the short option (FEB37P) to $2.00 for a
credit of $0.87. SUNW was up at the open but favorable positions
were still available at 10:00 AM as the stock price took a quick
breather. The (LJAN100C/FEB100C) calendar spread traded at $14.00.

Friday was expiration day for many of our plays and one of them
was a heart-stopper! Our credit spread on MCHP suffered cardiac
arrest after the company (on Thursday night) reported earnings
that were up from the previous year, but below Street estimates.
Shares fell over $5 in morning trading and although it eventually
went the distance (finishing at $35.12), the prudent exit was at
mid-day for a closing debit of $0.50, to break-even. The rest of
the credit spreads expired safely OTM. Even those that held AAPL
and BMCS to the close were successful.

We are starting to see more progress in the calendar spreads as
some of the positions are "paid for" and many have been moved to
the next higher strike. Our biggest dilemma is the ATI LEAP play
as the company said it agreed to merge with Britain's Vodafone
Group in a stock deal valued at about $56 billion. The merger is
considered valued at $97 per AirTouch common share and we are
curious to see the opening prices on our current positions next
week. Other short positions that were closed include CPQ, NOVL
and WCOM. New options need to be sold on OXHP and WCOM. BGP was
our only dismal failure and there may be some recovery next week.

The debit spreads did better this month, primarily because the
market was so bullish. Our main focus next week is the LU play.
We already have a profit and will plan to exit early on any bump
before the earnings. We are also watching FTL for any further
downward movement and hopefully some new take-over rumors will
surface. Good Luck!

The calendar (or time spread) is profitable if the value of the
position exceeds the initial debit (or cost-basis) at the end of
the expiration period for the long position. However, because we
track the plays based on the current closing cost/value, and some
of the plays have diagonal positions, the gains will rarely be
reflected until the play closes. Each month, as we sell a new call
against the long position, the net cost should decline or position
value should increase.

ABI - American Bankers Insurance  $48.87     Call Debit Spread

American Bankers Insurance Group (ABIG) sells wholesale, credit
related specialty insurance. Financial institutions, retailers,
automobile and manufactured-housing dealers, and representatives
then retail these policies to consumers. Products include property
insurance (on items ranging from mobile homes to appliances), as
well as life, unemployment, and disability insurance.

Trading in American Bankers Insurance Group options has been brisk
lately following weeks of inactivity as bid speculation reemerges.
Traders cited talk that American International Group, which had
attempted to buy American Bankers last year, (before Cendant Corp
outbid AIG and then pulled out of the deal because of accounting
problems) would return with another offer. Things are heating up
as ING Baring Furman Selz said it resumed coverage of ABI with a
"strong buy" rating. The report says American Bankers is one of
its favorite companies among specialty insurers and states the
company is likely to resume double digit revenue and earnings
growth in the second half of 1999 while earning 15% to 20% on its
equity. The 1999 share price target is $58 and the technical
outlook is favorable.

HUM - Humana Inc.  $19.50     (Neutral) Calendar Spread

One of the largest health care companies in the US, Humana offers
health maintenance organizations (HMOs), preferred provider
organizations (PPOs), and Medicare supplement insurance. They have
about 6 million members and Humana tries to cut costs by offering
physicians incentives and requiring pre-authorization for hospital
inpatient services and outpatient surgery. Medicare accounts for
almost one-third of sales, but Humana is cutting back its Medicare
HMO business. The company markets its products to employers and
other groups, as well as to certain Medicare-eligible individuals.
In the past year, Humana has been the sector's most active merger,
acquisition and divestiture participant as the company moved to
purchase health plans in its largest markets while divesting non-
strategic assets to focus on profitable core businesses.

A Florida appellate court recently ruled that a lawsuit against
Humana could not proceed as a class action and that it should be
dissolved. The opinion strongly supports HUM's contention that
the class action had no merit. This may help investors regain
favor with the company as its likely their business practices have
always been both ethical and legal. The chart reflects a new range
of trading developing near $20 and that makes it perfect for a
calendar spread.

PLAY (conservative):

BUY  CALL MAY-20 HUM-ED OI=3D567  A=3D$2.43
SELL CALL FEB-20 HUM-BD OI=3D1814 B=3D$1.12
NET DEBIT TARGET=3D$1.25 TARGET ROI=3D40%

Note: In the long-term calendar spread, we are reducing the net
cost of the long-term option by the credit from the sale of the
nearer-term call. If the near-term call expires worthless, we will
sell the MAR call to further reduce our debit. If your short-term
position is ITM on the last day of the strike, you need to buy it
back so that you DON'T have to exercise the long-term position. In
that case, your long option is going up in value also and on the
last day of the strike period, the short call will shrink down to
intrinsic value so you will be ahead in the play even after you
buy it back.

GMSTF - Gemstar Intl.  $59.87     Put Credit Spread

GMSTF develops, markets and licenses proprietary technologies and
systems that simplify and enhance consumers' interaction with
electronics products and other platforms that deliver video,
programming information and other data. A recent report rated the
stock "neutral" for conservative investors and "accumulate" for
more aggressive investors based on the company's huge potential
and superior management. A 14 month conservative target price was
set at $57.00. GMSTF also recently filed patent infringement suits
against Scientific Atlanta, Pioneer and General Instrument Corp,
claiming that these companies willfully infringed two (Levine)
patents, by virtue of deployment, marketing, offers to sell and
sale of cable set top boxes containing an interactive program
guide not licensed under these patents. The Levine patents broadly
cover, among others, an interactive program guide using locally
stored or cached data. Gemstar is seeking injunctions and monetary
damages from these companies. Other news includes acquisitions of
VideoGuide and Starsight.

Basically, we favor the technical trading range tops near $45 as
current support for this position but use the downward momentum
by opening the long position first. Then sell the short position
when the stock price firms, to create the credit spread.

COF - Capital One Finance  $130.43     Put Credit Spread

Capital One Financial Corporation is a holding company, whose
subsidiaries provide a variety of products and services including
credit card products, certain consumer lending, deposit services,
and various operating, administrative and other services. COF is
one of the largest issuers of Visa and MasterCard credit cards in
the United States. Quarterly earnings are due soon and they expect
to exceed analysts' current expectations. The reported earnings
should be approximately 30% higher than 1998 and that is above the
company's long-term objective of 20% earnings growth. Upgraded by
Paine Webber in early January and the stock price is now trading
above all recent resistance at new yearly highs.

ELN - Elan Corp  $68.93     Call Credit Spread

Elan Corporation dashingly develops drugs and the delivery systems
that control their absorption. Company subsidiaries include Elan
Pharmaceutical Technologies, which designs oral, microparticulate,
and transdermal (patch) delivery systems; Athena Neurosciences,
which develops drugs for such disorders as Alzheimer's disease;
and Axogen, a research and development (R&D) spinoff. The company
is also bulking up with acquisitions, including Sano Corporation,
Neurex, and Kodak's drug-delivery system maker NanoSystems. Elan
makes some 20 products (including Cardizem CD, marketed by Hoechst
Marion Roussel) sold in more than 45 countries. Based on the news,
lots of drugs and new products in the pipeline. The recent merger
frenzy may have hurt the current bottom-line and investor support
is fading. Just another technical play as this stock has failed
to reach $75 five times in 180 days.

INDEX OPTION SPREADS...
******************************************************************
As a trader, you may be familiar with options on individual stocks
where you have the right to buy (call option) or the right to sell
(put option) a particular stock at some predetermined price within
some predetermined time. The buyer has the rights and the seller
the obligations. With index options the basic ideas are the same.
Index options allow you to make investment decisions on a specific
market industry or on the market as a whole. Spread strategies can
be made with index options similar to those made with individual
stock options. Many professional traders employ index spreads as a
hedge strategy. We favor debit positions on the SPX for momentum
and longer-term plays and OTM credit spreads on the OEX when the
risk/reward is favorable. Low ROI disparity spreads will be listed
(when available) for the conservative index trader.
*******************************************************************
OEX - S&P 100 Index  $616.46     OTM Credit-Spreads

The Standard & Poor's 100 Index is a capitalization-weighted index
of 100 stocks from a broad range of industries. The component
stocks are weighted according to the total market value of their
outstanding shares. The impact of a component's price change is
proportional to the issue's total market value, which is the share
price times the number of shares outstanding.

OBSERVATIONS:

For OTM credit spread trades, we like to use the actively-traded
S&P 100 Index options because they contain much more premium than
options on individual stocks and provide an underlying instrument
less prone to huge, gapping moves. Remember however, that you can
always be exercised early so monitor your positions daily.

TECHNICALS:

The overall market seems likely to remain in a wide trading range
over the next few weeks and the long-term outlook is for a two-way
market with somewhat neutral bias. Secondary issues are performing
well but big-caps continue to suffer. The DOW and the S&P 500 both
remain above their 30 wma's and over 50% of all stocks are now in
stage II. The call/put ratio is slightly pessimistic so there may
be some upside testing before any further correction. Review the
OEX trading pit for more specific technical information on the S&P
100 Index.

**********************************************??Never, ever trust a central=
 bank in a foreign country with it's?currency under attack.??Remember the v=
ow from the central bank in Brazil on Thursday??"We will utilize every rese=
rve at our disposal to prevent the?disastrous floating of the Real". I gues=
s their reserves were?as limited as my wife's checking account since less t=
welve hours?later they announced they would float the Real on a temporary?b=
asis in order to protect their reserves. Sounds like a?contradiction to me.=
 So why did the markets rebound instead of?crash as analysts had predicted?=
??Ask ten analysts and you will get ten different answers but the?two most =
common are "it took a level of uncertainty out of the?market" and "relief t=
hat the free market forces would now determine?the level of the Real and no=
t artificial stability enforced by the?government". The first one makes no =
sense at all. On Thursday the?Dow crashed -228 points on worries that Brazi=
l MIGHT float. So?on Friday they floated and because there was no uncertain=
ty left?the market exploded? Lost me there. The second reason make much?mor=
e sense. Brazil has been fighting the flight of funds from the?country by r=
aising interest rates to a crushing 40% or more. How?would you like to have=
 that kind of credit card interest? How?can a country survive paying 40% on=
 it's debt? It can't, not for?long. The relief shown in Brazil markets was =
immediate and huge.?The Bovespa surged +1,690 points or +33.41%. That would=
 be the?equivalent of +3,123 point Dow day. (please, please, just let?me be=
 fully invested the night before!!) I bet they are still?celebrating in Bra=
zil today. Yes their money is worth less but?now they can at least kep more=
 of it. The remaining problem is?with Chile, Argentina, and the other close=
ly linked South American?countries. They will be watching the Real and if i=
t sinks fast?then they will be forced to devalue as well. The dominos are?a=
lready lining up. All eyes will be on the support given to?Brazil by the U.=
S. and the IMF in the coming weeks to see if?the Real can stand on it's own=
 or become a blackhole, sucking?everyone in South America down with it.??No=
w back to our reality. The market, for whatever reason,?exploded Friday, th=
e day before a long weekend, when it should?have been cautious. Remember th=
e oversold conditions we talked?about on Thursday. The rubber band analogy =
I used last week on?the +500 point gain also works on a -500 point loss. Wh=
en?markets get stretched so tight either way there has to be a?relief day w=
here things snap back to normal. We experienced?that Friday. I have been pr=
eaching the return of the January?bull market rally after the profit taking=
 for over a week.?Surprise, it is back! Those of you who bought the dip on?=
Thursday are looking pretty smart today.??The Nasdaq actually finished up f=
or the week! Tech stocks?rebounded strong and were really not supported by =
the Internet?stocks. Some Internets were up Friday but the majors were?stil=
l taking profits. Speaking of major Internet stocks, we?are starting YHOO a=
gain today for the split run. Yahoo dropped?-98 points in the last four day=
s but closed +$13 off it's?Friday lows. The 2:1 split is Friday Feb 5th, on=
ly three?weeks away. We know the Internets have had several downgrades?in t=
he last week but they were only downgraded on price, not?performance. Those=
 of you who have the ability to trade YHOO?should look for an entry point t=
his week. Don't blindly jump?in on Tuesday. Confirm lack of downward moveme=
nt first.??We had a conference at the office here last week with many?of th=
e newsletter contributors coming in from all over the U.S.?We were planning=
 the first Option Investor Seminar in February.?(details below) What really=
 came out of the planning process?was the need to educate traders on "trend=
 trading" (not trend?holding) and setting profit goals. While all this will=
 be?discussed in detail at the seminar there is a real need based?on the em=
ail we get to touch on some of the concepts here.??Let me try an analogy fo=
r trend trading. The market is like?the waves on the ocean. If you are stan=
ding on one of the?major surfing beaches you will see wave after wave come?=
crashing through. Between each major wave is a period of?calm which may hav=
e several smaller waves. If you have ever?stood in the surf you are familia=
r with the sensation called?undertow. This is when the water rushes back ou=
t to sea in?preparation for the next wave. Now picture yourself with a?desi=
re to surf. You have seen people do it. You go to a?surfboard shop and buy =
a board. You ask the salesman if?surfing is hard. No problem, he says. Lay =
on the board,?swim out in the surf, catch a wave, stand up on the board?and=
 surf back in. Easy! Now I ask you, can you surf? If you?are like most begi=
nner surfers you get out to the waves but?now you feel more like a piece of=
 driftwood bobbing in an?endless sea than a human mastering the art of surf=
ing. You?are battered, soaked, tired and more likely then not pretty?frustr=
ated with being abused by every wave you tried to?catch. Options trading is=
 like surfing. Trading, the salesman?says, is easy. You just open an accoun=
t, (board), jump in?the market (ocean), catch a wave (stock), buy some call=
s?(surf), and end up safely on the beach (profit). NOT!?Most beginning trad=
ers think it is this easy. Most end up?on the rocks (broke).??What we want =
to teach you is to be a successful trader, not?a buy and holder. When you a=
re learning to surf you probably?practice on hundreds of smaller waves. Eac=
h one moving you?only a few yards before you fall and have to start over.?L=
earning how to trade is the same way. You should try to?catch many small mo=
ves and practice improving your skills?before attempting the long run to th=
e beach. I am constantly?besieged by email on new people expecting to buy a=
 $3 option?and sell it for $15. That would be the equivalent of swimming?ha=
lf a mile off shore, catching a fifty foot wave and surfing?all the way to =
the beach on your first try. It just does not?happen. What we have tried to=
 teach people in the past it to?take a small profit many times instead of a=
 large profit once.??For those that are mathematically challenged let me il=
lustrate.?If you start with a $10,000 account and generate a 10% profit?eve=
ry week for a year, WITHOUT COMPOUNDING, after twelve months?you would have=
 over $60,000. If you COMPOUND the 10% then you?would have over $1,000,000.=
 At just 10% a week! Now before you?start firing off those emails I know yo=
u can't compound 10%?every week. First you may hit some losers now and then=
 but?you are also going to hit some bigger winners more often. Just?to illu=
strate. If you bought an option for $5.00 and sold it?for $5.50 that is a 1=
0% profit. Now how many times have you?bought an option and watched it go u=
p $1-$2 and then slip?back down again the next day? More often than not! No=
w, if?you had put in a sell for $6.00 that is a 20% profit and?probably wou=
ld fill the same day. If you did that twice a?week, how much would that be =
a week. CLUE 40% Now if you?could get only 10% or $.50 per week compounded =
over a year?it would be over $1,000,000. Is $.50 hard to do over and?over a=
nd over? Of course not. Is 40% possible? absolutely.?The real number is som=
ewhere in between.??It is only hard to do if you HOLD and not TRADE. How fa=
r are?you going to get if you just hold on to your surf board with?both han=
ds for dear life? You will be pushed to and fro?wherever the ocean (market)=
 takes you. Sometimes you will?be pushed to the beach (profit) or onto the =
rocks (broke)?or drift out to sea never to be seen again. (clueless)??Now t=
hat I have completely lost my train of thought let's?get to the point. Ever=
y stock ebbs and flows. Remember the?3-5-7 trend cycle from last week? Up t=
hree days, down one,?up five days, down three, up seven days, down five. Ev=
ery?stock will normally trade in one of these cycles. The trick?is to buy t=
he stock on the down side and sell it on the up?side. Again, you do not hav=
e to be in the market every day.?It is better to only be in the market WHEN=
 THERE IS PROFIT?TO BE MADE. Everything else is noise. Sometimes expensive?=
noise. Learn to play the trends. Watch a stock for several?days. Study the =
charts. Watch the intraday charts. Learn?how it moves. I traded TXN early l=
ast year for a month.?It would always jump up at the open, wander during th=
e day?and drop at the close. For weeks I would sell at the open?for a $.50 =
to $1.00 profit and then buy the same option?back at the close for almost w=
hat I had paid for it the?day before. Day in and day out. Cash flow. 10% a =
day.?(don't even bother to compound that) In this current bull?market there=
 are many, many stocks that you can make 10%?or more a day just trading the=
 trends. The larger your?account becomes the easier it gets. You can start =
taking?5% a day. For instance, look at a CSCO chart or an ASND.?Can you see=
 any way possible to not have made a $1.00 a?day, two or three days a week,=
 just trading those stocks???The positive trend is the key. Find a stock wi=
th a trend,?pick and option, WAIT for an entry point, set a limit sell.?Rep=
eat, repeat, repeat, repeat......??I want 10 volunteers. Pick a stock or tw=
o, practice the?above plan and send me your results. I will publish the?res=
ults and give each of you a years free subscription.?Obviously I will have =
15,000 emails tomorrow volunteering?and I can't take you all. The first 10 =

.??When I publish these results you will never look at a?mutual fund claimi=

st goes to show that the best laid?plans of mice and men sometimes go astra=
y. Everything was?looking so good moving into last week. We expected a litt=
le?profit taking and then off to the races again. Little did we?expect a mo=
nster dip caused by Brazil at the end of the profit?taking. The put-credit-=
spreads that were well on their way?to expiring worthless for a full profit=
, suddenly were in?jeporday of being a serious liability. My INKT 150 puts =
were?$30 out of the money on Monday and $10 in the money on?Wednesday! Ouch=
. Short cover madness. The 130-puts still?expired worthless but I bit the b=
ullet on the $150. Then?on Thursday the 50-contract MCHP $35 put credit spr=
ead was?safely out of the money with MCHP at $41.50. The bid was?$.06 x.19.=
 Thursday night MCHP announced earnings and missed?their estimates by $.01.=
 BOOM! Down $8.00 Friday morning!?The bid is now $3.50 for an option I wrot=
e for $.56.?Fortunately MCHP came back to close at $35.13. I covered the?50=
 contracts at $.38 30 min before the close and was happy?to get it. People =
emailed me last month and asked why I?had closed several put spreads severa=
l days early for .25?or less when I could have let them expire worthless. T=
his?was why. Always take a profit when one is available and you?will never =
lose money. Holding an option long term is like?suicide. The trade will blo=
w up on you when you least expect?it.??The $45 NEON put credit spread was c=
losed at .25 for almost?a maximum profit.??I closed the ATI calls for a sub=
stantial loss after the bidders?started dropping out. Had I held until Frid=
ay I could have?broken even.??I will probably get criticized for the follow=
ing but I have?suffered in the past from not selling in the face of seeming=
ly?very bad news and did not want to have history repeat itself.?When the f=
irst Asian problem occurred in Oct 1997 I was heavily?invested and did not =
sell. I thought it was no big deal and?would bounce back in a day or two. I=
 woke up at the open on?the biggest drop day to see the futures lock limit =
down at?-27 and Dow futures out of sight. It was a disaster and by?not sell=
ing at the open I lost almost three times as much.?So the point of the stor=
y was I did not want to be holding?if Brazil was going to explode the world=
 economy again.??I took a bloodbath Wednesday morning and sold at the low f=
or?the day. The good news was that I was in cash for the rebound.?Once I re=
alized that the bull market was viewing this as a?buying opportunity I jump=
ed right back in. Basically I broke?even for the day but there was a lot of=
 anguish before the?market closed.??Summary: Plays from last Sunday??* =3D =
