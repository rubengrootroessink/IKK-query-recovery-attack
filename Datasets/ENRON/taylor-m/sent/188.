Justin -

How do we participate in the CEPI?  Are we providing prices to them?

Subject: New European Power Index - CEPI

Dow Jones will this month launch a new power index, known as the Central 
European Power Index (CEPI). The participating companies include Enron, 
PreussenElektra, Electrabel and VASA. The delivery point will be a point on 
the PreussenElektra grid.

CEPI is the second Central European index to be introduced by Dow Jones, the 
first being SWEP.
