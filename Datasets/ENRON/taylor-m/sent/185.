1. Jason Rose
2. Jason appeared intelligent and poised.  He was well prepared for his 
interview.  
3. While Jason has some legal-related experience, I wonder if a second year 
student might not be a better catch for us.  If we don't have that as an 
option, I think Jason would be fine.

please forward me a short email or voice mail on the candidates you 
interviewed indicating:

 (2)  What you thought of them (generally)
 (3) Whether you would hire them
 **if you interviewed more than 1 candidate, please rank them
 
 --> Julia and I will meet sometime next week to go over the feedback (anyone 
who interviewed is welcome to join us).

 Thanks!

 Monica
