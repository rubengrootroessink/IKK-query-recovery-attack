The only other matters I know of are (i) the Thursday morning interview of 
Timothy Hailes for a position in the Houston Swap Group and (ii) that Mark 
mentioned to me that he is planning a trip up to Teeside on Wednesday.  We 
are trying to set up another interview on Thursday (with David Lacey) but it 
hasn't been finalized yet.

Meagan,

The only meeting I know MEH will be attending is the ISDA Bd. Mtg. on 
Tuesday, Jan. 26th.  at 12:00 noon.  FYI, MEH departs Houston, Jan. 24th at 
6:55 p.m. and arrives London, Jan. 25th at 9:55 a.m..  MEH will be at the 
Savoy and plans to return Jan. 29th on the 9:40 a.m. flight.

Mark Taylor:

Could you tell me which meeting you believe MEH would like to attend?

Thank you,
