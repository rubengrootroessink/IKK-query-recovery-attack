Tana and I were unable to find anything useful here.  David Mitchell thought 
he might find something for us in his files and will send it to us but as he 
remembers it, we never got very far with the details.  He probably just 
advised that if we ever did set up a CTA that it should be completely 
separate - both in legal entity and staff - from our trading activities and 
should be Chinese Wall fenced  as well.  I'll send over whatever we receive 
from him and warned him that you might be calling.
