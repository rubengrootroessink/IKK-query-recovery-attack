My only concern is that the letter may not adequately tie the master 
agreement referred to and the products affected in a situation where we have 
more than one master (covering different commodities or transaction types) 
with the same counterparty.  I can imagine a situation where Credit doesn't 
want us to use a physical master but the financial master is ok or vice 
versa.  I mentioned this to Bob and he will watch for situations where Credit 
is only "turning off" one master in a multiple master setting.  We should 
also be listing each master affected if Credit wants to turn them all off.
