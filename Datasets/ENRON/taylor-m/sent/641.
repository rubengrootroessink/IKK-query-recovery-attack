Subject: EOL Customer Review

Mark,

The City Of Riverside has mailed in a password application form to trade on 
EnronOnline (EOL).  This customer is considered a "muni" and we need to know 
if there are any legal restrictions (by product type) that would keep them 
from trading on EOL.  We would like to respond back to this customer as soon 
as we receive approval/rejection back from our legal, credit, and tax 
departments.

Please contact me with any questions.

Thanks for your help!

Frank
