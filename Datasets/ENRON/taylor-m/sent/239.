Wow - that is one nasty looking storm out there - I wish I'd gotten in early 
enough to get a covered parking spot.  Oh well, may sufficient hail storm 
damage will get me a new car!

How would you like to deal with the Astros ticets?  I have a couple of 
meetings scheduled but am pretty flexible today - maybe lunch time or when 
you're ready to leave for the day?  Just let me know.  Call if you want - 
713-853-7459.
