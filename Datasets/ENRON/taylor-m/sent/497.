I've put an hour on my calendar tomorrow afternoon to discuss conference 
issues.

Please advise at your earliest convenience on the below items.

I also need to go over the Master Billing Authorization form with you.  I 
will need to fax a completed form to the Conference Center, Tuesday, 9/28.

Recreation

The following recreational items are available for the conference attendees.  
Do you want to offer?  If so, what type of limitations:
 (TPC Golf $106 per person (includes cart fee) plus box lunch ($5-6.00))
 Tennis  - outdoor courts  (3) @ $12 hr per court
  - indoor courts  (3) @ $18 hr per court 
 Bike Rental @ $8  per 1/2 day
 Spa - See Taffy for menu of treatments - 3 treatments for a 10% discount??

Barbara suggested that we recruit Bob Walker to organize the golf outing.  Do 
you have any objection?

Business Center

I would suggest that we rent at least two additional faxes to accomodate our 
75+ attendees, since there is only one fax machine in the business center.  
The rate is $60 per additional line, plus rental of the fax machine.  Do you 
have any objection.
