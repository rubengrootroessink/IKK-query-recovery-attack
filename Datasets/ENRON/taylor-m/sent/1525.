I won't need the final locations until Joya has to submit the churn request.  
Since the construction isn't scheduled to be complete until 12/22 I wouldn't 
think we'd need it until the 15th - Joya will have a better feel for how far 
in advance we need to schedule the churn.

The legal assistants (and any lawyers who start before the construction is 
done) will be put in the cubes we have.  When we run out of cubes we have 
space to build more.

I am waiting for Dan Rogers and the rest of the Three Allen team's input on 
the office plan. If you need the plan today, I can give you a draft subject 
to any changes they would like to make. Let me know what you would like me to 
do.

One question I would have is the location of the paralegals/assistants coming 
over. I assume they will be in the new cubicles and workspaces being built 
out.
