Mark ,

My husband and I will be celebrating our first anniversary on August 1st, and 
plan to take trip to St. Maarten.  I would like to take schedule vacation 
time from Friday, July 30th thru Friday, August 6th.  I would return to the 
office on Monday, August 9th.  I hope this meets with your approval.

Thanks.
