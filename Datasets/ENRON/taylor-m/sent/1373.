As the office construction process continues, your offices will be among the 
next to be demolished & reconstructed.  While the current timetable is not 
firm, it looks like your moves will be scheduled sometime between the 5th to 
the 13th of October (this means the move may take place during the ENA 
offsite).  I just wanted to give you as much warning as possible so you could 
begin the packing process.  Joya Davis will have details of your new (in some 
cases temporary) office locations, can help with obtaining boxes and will 
schedule the actual move.
