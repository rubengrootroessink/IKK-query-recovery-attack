Dear David,

Here is the version of the above document that Michael and I have drawn up 
for you.  Please note that the English law version of the document needs to 
be printed on Enron Europe Limited letterhead.

Mark - David has also asked for a Texas law version of this document.  Would 
you be able to arrange for one of the Houston lawyers to take a look at the 
document and make any necessary changes which would be required as a matter 
of Texas law.  Please feel free to give Michael Brown or myself a call if you 
need to have a chat about. Thanks.

Kind regards, Edmund.
