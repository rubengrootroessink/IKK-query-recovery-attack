All -

Just to let you know, a new attorney has joined 'Lonesome Ole Me' here in 
Singapore as of yesterday.  His name is Matthias Lee and he will be providing 
the support for the physical and financial trading side of things here in 
Singapore as well as any general support which the folks here in Singapore 
may require if they pertain to Singapore law issues.  

For your info, Matt will be reporting to Alan Aronowitz.

Thanks,
Anita
