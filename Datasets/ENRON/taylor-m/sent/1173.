As we discussed, the following is revised disclosure regarding direct access 
to deal with the cost issue:

EnronOnline will assist users, upon request, in arranging for the connection 
of "T1" lines or other means of direct access to EnronOnline, as an 
alternative to internet access.   Direct access connections might enable 
users to access EnronOnline more quickly than is currently possible through 
internet access.

Please call if you want to discuss.  Have a good weekend.
