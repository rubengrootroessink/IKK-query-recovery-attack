Could you guys please get in touch with Andrea Bertone in Sao Paolo & send 
her copies of our forms that might be useful in coming up with appropriate 
documentation for this transaction.  Sara - you should probably discuss with 
her the regulatory situation and make sure we can actually do this.  Brent 
may have some information as well.

Thanks,

Mark

Mark / Tana,

The origination team in Brasil is about to close Enron's first electricity 
trading transaction in Brasil (in fact it will be also the first one in 
Brasil). Just to summarise, we are negotiating the purchase of 3MW for 30 
days to sell it to an industrial customer.

I spoke with Andrea Bertone (our internal legal counsel) and we thought that 
the most efficient way to develop the contracts between Enron, the seller and 
the purchaser of power would be to use the model of contracts that Enron 
currently applies for the electricity trading transaction in the US, and then 
adapt them considering the commercial conditions of the deal as well as the 
Brazilian regulatory aspects. Therefore, I would like to ask you to send us a 
copy of such contracts, and since the power will be available on 01 April, I 
would really appreciate if you could send them asap.

Thanks and regards,

Marcelo Parodi
