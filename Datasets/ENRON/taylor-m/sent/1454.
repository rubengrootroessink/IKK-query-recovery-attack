I know that you will be at a management meeting the exact same time that this 
conference is scheduled
to take place, but I was hoping you could assign this task to someone else in 
ENA Legal.  As you will note
on the agenda attached below, we have placed the Legal Department at the top 
of the agenda after the 
introduction to discuss "Legal Implications of the Electronic Marketplace".

This discussion should conceivably include discussions of the following 
topics:  

Electronic signatures (in particular EnronOnline)
Websites for delivery and executing confirmations (Commodity Logic)
See "XIII Future Trends" on Page 4 of the agenda

Please let me know as soon as possible if this will be possible.  As you can 
see, this is a very important
topic for us.  Call me if I can help clarify any points.  

One other point - I am assuming that you guys are the head guys for financial 
and physical legal decision 
making for Houston, Calgary and London.   For your information, there may be 
some lawyer types coming from the London
Global Markets group.

Also, JAD means Joint Accelerated Development.
