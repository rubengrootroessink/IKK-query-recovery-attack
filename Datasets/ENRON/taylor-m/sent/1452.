Janette:

This may be more than you were looking for - let me know if you want me to 
pare it down a bit.  I assume we will have the opportunity to revise these as 
time goes on......

		 Subject: Description for your Group

The Technology Plan Committee is meeting again this Wednesday, and I need to 
give the committee an update on the progress of my work.  I would appreciate 
your response to the following.  Many thanks.

The committee has started working on the first phase of the Technology Plan 
which is to develop an intranet web page for ENA Legal.  Our department's 
organizational chart will be provided as well as a description of the area(s) 
of responsibilities for each group.  Would you be so kind as to provide me 
with a short paragraph describing your group's responsibilities?  The group 
is scheduled to meet again on Wednesday, October 25, so if I could have the 
description of your group's responsibilities as soon as possible it would be 
greatly appreciated.  

Mark Haedicke is eager to have our intranet web page designed as soon as 
possible.  Many thanks for your time and attention to this matter.
