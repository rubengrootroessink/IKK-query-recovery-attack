BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP


I am NURA USMAN, a management consultant in the Department of Petroleum=20
Resources (DPR), I am a member of the Tenders Board a Committee in charge o=
f=20
Contract Awards and Payment Approvals (C A P A). I got your contact during =
my=20
quest for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential=20
transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreig=
n=20
account

There were series of contracts executed by a consortium of Multinationals i=
n=20
the oil industry in favor of the (DPR) among which were;

1) The expansion of Pipeline network within Nigeria for crude oil and
downstream products distribution and subsequent evacuation. - USD$2 Billion=
.
2) Contract for Turn around Maintenance (TAM) at the various Refineries in=
=20
the country.
3) The construction of Storage Tanks for Petroleum Product (Depots) =01)USD=
$94=20
Million.

The original value of these contracts were deliberately over invoiced to th=
e=20
tune of Thirty Six million, Five Hundred and sixty one thousand United Stat=
es=20
Dollars (USD$36,561,000.00) which has recently been approved and now ready =
to=20
be transferred. However the companies that actually executed the=20
aforementioned contract have been fully paid and the project officially=20
commissioned.

Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount =
to=20
your account for subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants are=20
prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau (Civil Service Laws) from opening=
=20
and/ or operating foreign accounts in our names.

Needless to say, the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous. In=
=20
return, we have agreed amongst ourselves to offer you 20% of the transferre=
d=20
sum, while 10% shall be set aside for any incidental expenses during the=20
course of this transaction, you will then be mandated to revert the balance=
=20
70% to us in due course, or as will be advised in due course.
You must however NOTE that this transaction is subject to the following
terms and conditions; Our conviction of your transparent honesty and
diligence, that you must accord this transaction with utmost confidentialit=
y=20
and secrecy.

Modalities have been worked out at the highest levels of the Ministry of
Finance, Central Bank of Nigeria and the Presidential Task Force on Contrac=
t=20
Payment for the immediate remittance of the funds within 10 - 14 working da=
ys=20
subject to your satisfaction of the above stated terms. Our assurance is th=
at=20
the risk involved with your role shall be reduced to the barest minimal. To=
=20
accord this transaction the legality it deserves, and for mutual security o=
f=20
the funds, the whole approval procedures shall be legally processed with yo=
ur=20
name or any company you may nominate as the bona fide beneficiary of the=20
funds.

Once more, I want you to understand that having put in over 20 years of
meritorious service to my country, I am very much averse to having my image=
=20
and career dented. This matter should therefore be treated with utmost=20
secrecy and urgency. Kindly expedite action as we are well behind
schedule to enable us include this transfer in the Second quarter of the 20=
01=20
fiscal year contractual payments.

Do confirm your interest with a return email to usm2001ng@onebox.com

Thank You.

REGARDS,

NURA USMAN.
