Happy 1999 and welcome back.  Sorry to hear about your travel problems.  I 
know how much fun a night in the airport can be.  I'd be happy to talk about 
the US commodity laws at one of our group meetings.  I'm going to be in 
London the last week of this month - maybe we can set something up for then?

I've been thinking about what we could cover at our London trading meeting 
every Tuesday and thought it would be a good idea if we could get you to give 
the group a 15-20 minute overview of US commodities law. I think this would 
be particularly helpful for our newest members, Robert Quick and Mark 
Elliott. Please let me know what you think. Thanks!
