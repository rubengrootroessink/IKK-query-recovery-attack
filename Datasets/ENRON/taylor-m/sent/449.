Sorry for not getting back to you sooner (I was out of town last weeek) - 
unfortunately, I have a 2:00 already on my calendar but am available later.  
If you want to meet with Alan & Jeff first and see me afterwards, that's ok 
with me.

Torrey, and myself would like to set-up a time for Monday to discuss a few 
EOL issues that we feel pertinent to the Legal Department. If you could let 
me know if  the afternoon ( 2:00) works for you I would greatly appreciate 
it. Once I hear from you I will set-up a room for us all to meet. 

Thank you for your time, TARA SWEITZER
