The Inn at Little Washington sounds great but I'm afraid I won't be able to 
make it this time.  However, as the geekiest among I consider it my duty to 
point out that since the millennium doesn't actually end until December 31, 
2000, we do have next year!

This is your last chance to spend Easter with us in this millennium.  Amanda 
and I will be in DC on Saturday and then we are going to the Inn at Little 
Washington outside of DC for Sunday dinner.  Why don't you two Texans charter 
a jet and come on in?  It will make a splash with the locals.  Amanda can 
introduce you around the law school and upgrade her own standing in the 
community.
