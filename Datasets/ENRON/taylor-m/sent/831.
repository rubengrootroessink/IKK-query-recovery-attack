thanks mark - the contracts are physical, and as a result all C/Ps that trade 
UK physical gas can have access.

Justin - are the EnBank contracts physical or financial?  It seems to me we 
should use the same customer profiles - that is if the contracts are 
physical, then any counterparty which can trade physical UK gas should have 
access.  If the contracts are financial, then any counterparty that can trade 
UK derivatives should have access.

Justin,

I am assuming that there is no reason from a legal perspective to restrict 
access to EnronOnline EnBank Auctions - so we will proceed with setting up 
the user profiles this way (I've already checked with credit).

Please let me know if this is assumption is incorrect and we need to restrict 
access.

Thanks,

Dave
