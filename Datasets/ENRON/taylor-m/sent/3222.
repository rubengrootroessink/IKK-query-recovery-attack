I have attached a new draft version of the Enron Services Agreement which 
incorporates the changes discussed on our call and those distributed by 
Carlos. I have also attached a blacklined version to show the changes made 
form the previously distributed version.

If you have any questions or comments please call me at (212) 558-3491. David 
will be out of the office tomorrow but we can conference him in if we need to 
discuss any further revisions.

Regards,
Kieran
