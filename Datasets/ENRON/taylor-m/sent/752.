MEMORANDUM TO:=09Paul Simons=20

 RE:=09Enron Online/Credit Product

This memorandum summarizes the proposed procedures we discussed during our=
=20
meeting on January 13, 2000 for use in connection with the credit derivativ=
es=20
product (the =01&Product=018) to be offered by Enron Capital & Trade Resour=
ces=20
International Corp. and its affiliates (collectively, =01&Enron=018) throug=
h =01&Enron=20
Online=018.  These procedures, which we will be assisting you in preparing,=
 are=20
designed to reduce Enron=01,s exposure to those entities on whose credit th=
e=20
Product will be based (the =01&Reference Entities=018) as well as Enron=01,=
s exposure=20
to other related types of liabilities.  We have previously outlined these=
=20
areas of exposure in our memoranda dated December 15, 1999 and December 22,=
=20
1999. =20
1. Disclosure =01* All Reference Entities should be advised, by letter, of =
the=20
fact that they will be included in the list of entities that will be the=20
subject of the Product.  These disclosures will of course be separate from,=
=20
although related to, the disclosures to be provided to counterparties to=20
transactions in the Product.

? This disclosure should inform the Reference Entity of the introduction of=
=20
the Product, and describe the general nature of the Product and the manner =
in=20
which it will be traded (e.g., through Enron Online).

? In general, however, Enron need not request that the Reference Entities=
=20
consent to or acknowledge their inclusion in the list of the Reference=20
Entities, except as set forth below in paragraph 2.=20

  2. Consent =01* Enron should, however, obtain the prior consent of certai=
n=20
types of Reference Entities before including them in the list of Reference=
=20
Entities.

? In particular, consent should be obtained from any Reference Entities wit=
h=20
which Enron has a significant trading relationship that includes advice or=
=20
other services that could result in Enron being considered a fiduciary of t=
he=20
Reference Entity or that could otherwise give rise to common law duties tha=
t=20
could be violated if the Reference Entity does not consent to the arrangeme=
nt.

? Enron need not seek consent from those large and sophisticated=20
counterparties to which Enron merely provides prices and with which Enron=
=20
trades on an exclusively arms=01, length basis with no advisory or similar=
=20
services being provided and with no fiduciary obligations.

? Where consent is sought, Enron should include a request that the Referenc=
e=20
Entity acknowledge its receipt of the letter and its consent to being=20
included in the list of Reference Entities.  If a Reference Entity fails or=
=20
refuses to execute the letter, Enron will need to make a determination, on =
a=20
case-by-case basis, as to whether it is comfortable including that entity o=
n=20
the list of Reference Entities.  However, it should be recognized that, by=
=20
requesting consent, Enron may be limiting its ability to treat an entity as=
 a=20
Reference Entity in the absence of consent.

3. Chinese Wall =01* We understand that it will not be feasible to construc=
t a=20
complete =01&Chinese Wall=018 between the operations related to the Product=
 and=20
Enron=01,s other trading activities.  This is due primarily to the fact tha=
t=20
activities related to the Product will utilize the same credit function as=
=20
Enron=01,s other trading activities.  However, Enron should implement a mod=
ified=20
Chinese Wall between the trading operations.  This approach would enhance=
=20
Enron=01,s ability to defend successfully against any claims of impropriety=
 or=20
breach of duty by facilitating Enron=01,s ability to demonstrate that=20
information had not been shared by other traders with those trading the=20
Product. This could be accomplished through a number of procedures.

? First, Enron should maintain the maximum possible degree of physical=20
separation between personnel responsible for pricing and trading the Produc=
t,=20
on the one hand, and Enron=01,s other trading activities, on the other hand=
. =20
Even if personnel involved in the Product are located on the same floor as=
=20
other traders, it would be prudent to place them in a separate area of the=
=20
floor set off by partitions or similar features.

? Second, procedures should be developed to prohibit the flow of informatio=
n=20
between Product traders and other traders if such information is material t=
o=20
the creditworthiness of trading counterparties and is not in the public=20
domain.  In addition, all trading personnel should be instructed with respe=
ct=20
to the procedures through training programs.

? Finally, senior supervisory officers of Enron should be assigned to monit=
or=20
communications between the groups of traders and to review and make=20
determinations on requests by traders to communicate information that would=
=20
otherwise be prohibited under the procedures.  These procedures will be=20
similar to those that have been developed in connection with Enron=01,s equ=
ity=20
trading activities.

4. Restricted List -- Enron should establish and maintain a =01&restricted =
list=018=20
of those entities on which Products may not be traded.

? Initially, the list could be used to exclude those entities on which it i=
s=20
not feasible for Enron to offer Products due to the nature of its=20
relationships with such entities; e.g., those entities with respect to whic=
h=20
Enron might be considered a fiduciary and which have not consented to their=
=20
inclusion and those entities about which Enron has or regularly receives=20
material, non-public information.  In addition, those entities with which=
=20
Enron has entered into confidentiality agreements will most likely need to =
be=20
excluded, depending on the terms of such agreements.

? Enron should also establish procedures to monitor its receipt of=20
information regarding Reference Entities on which Products are listed. =20
Pursuant to these procedures, Enron should suspend the listing of quotation=
s,=20
and therefore the issuance of new Products, with respect to a Reference=20
Entity, if Enron is in possession of material, non-public information=20
regarding such Entity of a type, or in situations, that render suspension=
=20
necessary or advisable.  This would include situations in which Enron is=20
considering an investment in or a joint venture with a Reference Entity.  I=
n=20
addition, the procedures should provide for Reference Entities to be exclud=
ed=20
or deleted for reasons unrelated to Enron=01,s possession of information as=
=20
well; e.g., where Enron has reached or exceeded its credit limits with=20
respect to such Entities.=20

? The procedures should state that Enron may close out an open position for=
 a=20
Product held by a counterparty, if the counterparty specifically requests=
=20
Enron to do so.  The procedures should also address the pricing of the=20
closing transaction, however, and establish a mechanism for such pricing th=
at=20
minimizes Enron=01,s potential exposure to liability as a result of its=20
effecting a transaction while in possession of material, non-public=20
information.=20

? Enron should provide training to the appropriate personnel, which should=
=20
include instructing such personnel not to furnish Product counterparties wi=
th=20
any notification or explanation of a Reference Entity being placed on the=
=20
restricted list.=20

As noted, we will be assisting you in developing these procedurew, which wi=
ll=20
need to be integrated into Enron=01,s existing policies and procedures.  In=
=20
addition, as we have advised you in our prior memoranda, there are no=20
procedures that will fully insulate Enron from the potential liabilities=20
arising in connection with its offering of the Product.  However, the=20
implementation of the types of procedures described above should assist Enr=
on=20
in mitigating such risks and defending against claims that might be made by=
=20
Reference Entities.
Please call us if you have questions on these or other issues.
