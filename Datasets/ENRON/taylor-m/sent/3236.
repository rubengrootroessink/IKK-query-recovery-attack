I have taken a stab at a Legal & Privacy Statement for the Broker version of 
EnronOnline.  Please take a look and let me know what you think.  Justin - I 
don't know if or when they expect to launch something like this in Europe but 
I expect it won't be long.  Mark G. has been working on the Broker version of 
the ETA (the "BETA") and a Fee Agreement which we can send along.
