The next step is for Chad to contact the Credit Group in RAC.  They will do 
the credit analysis and send a  credit worksheet to the Swap Group paralegals 
who will prepare the first draft, run it by a lawyer and get it ready for the 
customer.

Mark-

As you can see from Chad's e-mail below, Irving Oil is interested in entering 
into an ISDA with us.  Please let us know, who will be assigned to prepare 
the documentation.

Thanks,

John

Per our conversation we have agreed to enter into an ISDA with Irving Oil.  
We suggested that Enron originate the documents to expedite the process.  
What should be my next step for this?  Thanks.
