I'm going to be hard to get next week - Monday & Tuesday I'll be in NYC 
(speaking at a conference), Wed. a.m. in the office and the rest of the week 
at the management conference.  If it works for you, any time the following 
week (20, 21 or 22) would be better for me.  If it is urgent, let me know and 
I will try to break from my meetings during the day on Mon., Tues. afternoon 
or maybe Wed. (but since that's the only time I'll be in the office all week 
it's already pretty full).  Just let me know - my assistant (Taffy x57373) 
can set something up on my calendar if you have a time you want to reserve.
