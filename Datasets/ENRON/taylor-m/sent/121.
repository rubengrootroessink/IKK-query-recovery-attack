Big blue beat estimates but investors turned red on Friday.

The bluest of the blue chips turned red on Friday after beating
analysts estimates. Even though they posted a win on the surface
the numbers behind the numbers painted the true picture. IBM made
$.04 a share on hedging currency. What this means is the currency
of other countries went up in value compared to previous levels
and IBM either made money on their currency hedge instruments or
the currency their customers used had gone up in value over
the value assigned when the deals were first done. If you agreed
to pay 1 million Baht for a computer when the Baht was worth 125
to the dollar and by the time the computer was delivered the Baht
was worth 100 to the dollar then IBM would get a windfall profit
of +20%. The difference between 125 and 100 to the dollar. (The
numbers used are for example only and not accurate) So IBM did
not do anything to earn the extra money except be in the right
place at the right time. IBM also had less sales than expected
which did not go well with analysts.

After the smoke cleared IBM had lost -$17 for the day. -$16 bln
in market cap. IBM accounted for over -70 points of the Dow loss
for the day.

SUNW on the other hand beat estimates by $.01 and announced a
split and only closed down -.44 for the day. It really was not
the fault of SUNW. The Nasdaq was hell bent on following the Dow
down even though it made several nice runs to positive territory
during the day. Sun had a backlog of $770 million in orders and
more coming in every day. The CEO said sales were expected to
increase as much as +20% this year. We expect SUNW to continue
upward with any Nasdaq rally.

The Clinton problem took a hard turn on Friday. With Republicans
starting to defect and looking for an easy way out to avoid more
negative press, the prospects of a dismissal look better every
day. This would help the market some as "no change" is typically
considered good news. The Byrd motion for dismissal is not likely
to pass but it set the tone for the future votes.

The real culprit again on Friday was the fallout from the Brazil
problem. Continued rumors of other countries possibly devaluing
their currencies put a cautious tone in the market ahead of the
weekend. Even though many very knowledgeable analysts said the
possibility of China or Hong Kong devaluing based on the current
Brazil problem was "very, very remote" the more safety conscious
investors were moving to the sidelines before the close. The
Brazil Bovespa recovered from earlier losses to close down only
-131 or -1.8%. All the European exchanges had closed down on
Friday as the increasing worry had investors taking profits there
also.

Is the U.S. market going down as some bears are saying? We don't
think so, YET. Without a "tail wagging the dog" news event this
week we feel that positive corporate earnings will continue to
move the market upward. Interest rates are going to remain flat.
Inflation is flat, the economy is growing. We have no reason to
sell off. The wild card is the Brazil crisis. The DOW, OEX and
RUT are all sitting at support on their moving averages. The
market is down -522 points in the last two weeks. We are due for
another technical "relief" rally this week. With all the negative
news out Friday the fact that the Dow only lost -73 points (if
you take out IBM) is remarkable. The Nasdaq had recovered from
a -38 point early loss and traded +15 until the end of the day
"fear of darkness" sell off. This is remarkable. The buy the
dip mentality is alive and well. There was strong buying at the
close on Friday as well as the early morning dip. As long as
buyers keep filling in the holes we will continue to build a
stronger base here. Again, the wild card is Brazil and the other
Latin America countries. A news flash on Monday morning could
wipe out the market in a heartbeat. Until the Brazil Real gains
some strength traders should consider playing smaller positions.
You can still capture some gains but have less at risk should
lightning strike.

We are at a pivotal point in the market. With all the major
averages setting on support it will take more bad news to push
us down and less good news to make it go up. There is still
lots of buyers in the market. As CNBC reported Friday there
is a huge "book" of buy orders at $2-$3 less than current prices
for many blue chip stocks. As long as these limit buy orders
stay on the books the chances of a substantial drop are slim.
Institutions want to buy but not at the top of the market. They
are using the "target shooting" approach we always suggest.

The target shooting approach to opening a position is simply
placing a limit buy order at -25 to -50% less than the current
ask and waiting for a dip to fill your order. Sometimes you
can wait days for a dip but in the current market climate we
are seeing dips almost every day. Normally the dips are too
quick to react with manual orders but if you have an existing
limit order you can get filled when it happens and sometimes
at the low for the day. For instance the SUNW FEB-100 Call
had a low for the day on Friday of $5.00 and a high of $8.00.
It closed at $6.50. The previous close was $7.50. A limit
order for -25% less than the previous close would have been
$5.63. You would have filled at $5.63 and could easily have
sold again for a +15% to +25% profit.

The AOL-140 Call closed Thursday at $14.00. A -25% limit order
would have been $10.50. On Friday the low for the day was $10
and the high was $14.88. You would have filled at $10.50 and
could have easily sold again for +20 to +30% profit the same
day.

Most traders would have bought at $13 or more after AOL started
back up. They would be thinking. OK, now it is moving, I will
jump in now. While this is not a bad idea it is not as good
as buying cheap. Once you make a decision to buy AOL or SUNW
or whichever stock you want, then the next decision is WHERE
to buy. If you use this method you will make fewer plays
because not all options will dip -25% in one day but the plays
you do make will be much more profitable. You will normally
be buying in at the low for the day. Would you like to be in
a position cheaper than everybody else?

We have had several serious rumors that Microsoft is going
to announce a 2:1 split this week. While the MSFT CFO had
said in an offhand remark several weeks ago that he would
"like to wait" until the $200 range before they split again,
I am being covered in emails that claim they will split
either Monday after the close or sometime during this week.
I have never had the volume of email on a split rumor that
I had on MSFT this week. I own MSFT currently and would
really be a happy trader if this comes to pass.

Watch the news Sunday for signs of the Brazilian flu and
plan your trades accordingly for Monday.


Good Luck

JIM'S PLAYS

The week started out great with Microsoft blowing away earnings
and gapping open the next day. I had broken a cardinal rule and
held over in anticipation of a split and got the earnings gap
as a surprise. THIS IS A VERY BAD IDEA!! I was forced to hold
some SUNW over earnings as the market was dropping too fast
and my limit orders never filled. Ouch! Fortunately Sun did
not do the IBM thing and actually traded up on Friday. If we
can get a Nasdaq rally Monday I might be able to get out of
the position alive. Other than the those two major trades
early in the week I did almost nothing. Friday I bought the
dip on faith and still feel pretty good about it. Now if
only Brazil does not blow up over the weekend.

This looks like a pretty good week but what you don't see
is the large loss I am currently holding in SUNW. If Sun does
not rise from the ashes this week the next Sunday recap will
be very ugly.

Market Sentiment
By Pinnacle Capital Advisors

Market's Momentum Lost

Don't look now, but the powerful market has lost its momentum and
we are beginning to see several classic failed rallies develop.
You would expect the financial and airlines sectors to roll over
given that these have been under pressure and trading below
their declining moving averages.  But what about Drug and
Healthcare? These sectors have been trading higher and should
follow the Technology sector into new territory, right?  Wrong.
Pinnacle turned Bearish on these sectors this weekend over the
near-term after violating key benchmarks of (DRG /740) and (HCX
/ 720), respectively.

More problematic is the Russell 2,000 (RUT). Not only is the
small cap coming up short of last July's high, but excessive
call buying by option speculators is occurring at out-of-the
money overhead benchmark levels as reflective by our high
Pinnacle Index (14.7) for the Russell 2,000.

The Power of Expectation Analysis

It has often been said that the crowd is right during the
market trends but wrong at both ends.  Measuring and
evaluating the sentiment of the crowd, therefore, can give
savvy option traders a decided edge.

Posture Alert

After selling off at an important failed rally benchmark, we
have turned Bearish on several industry sectors including
Banking, Drug, Healthcare and Airlines.  We caution investors
that we have received a near term reversal signal across many
sectors that many have violated their 50-day moving averages.

Great Expectations
By Pinnacle Capital Advisors

Great Expectations

With another wave of key corporate earnings reports due out this
week, we have highlighted below the companies that will likely
have the greatest impact on the overall market.  Keep close
track of these companies.  If they beat expectations, we are
likely to move higher.  If not, we are likely to re-test our key
support levels again.

Options traders playing the Technology sectors, watch Microsoft
on Tuesday.  Microsoft will likely dictate the climate for
the technology sector for 1Q99.

Excessive Optimism / Pessimism

Often times when companies release corporate earnings, the stock
will move/gap up or down depending on the level of expectation
built into the stock prior to the release date.  This level of
expectation can be measured, in part, by the Call/Put ratio and is
represented by our Pinnacle Index figure.  The average Pinnacle
Index is 2.0.  Therefore, an index appreciably higher than 2.0
reveals a high level of optimism while an index lower than 2.0
reveals a high level of pessimism.  For aggressive options traders,
we have highlighted companies reaching extreme expectation levels
below.

For example, the company with the highest and lowest expectation
reporting this week is Realnetworks (RNWK) and Baker Hughes (BHI)
with a Pinnacle Index of 12.2 and 1.0, respectively.  This
suggests that if Real Networks does not beat their estimate on
Tuesday, they are likely to sell-off.  Conversely, if Baker
Hughes beats their estimate or reports any favorable news, they
are likely to move higher.

The Power of Sentiment Analysis

Last October (1998), Pinnacle Capital Advisors tracked
corporate earnings reports and advised subscribers about
the impact that excessive optimism and pessimism can have
on the stocks's performance following the release of its
quarterly earnings report.  If you recall, we identified
several stocks that reached excessive sentiment levels
including Intel (INTC) and Pfizer (PFE).


Reporting                            Estimated   Pinnacle
Date        Company                        EPS      Index

Excessive Optimism:
10/13 INTL  Intel                          .79       5.2
10/13 JNJ   Johnson & Johnson              .70       3.7
10/15 AAPL  Apple Computer                 .49       3.6

Excessive Pessimism:
10/13 JPM   JP Morgan                     1.08        .4
10/12 C     Chrysler                       .87        .7
10/14 PFE   Pfizer                         .57        .9
10/13 GM    General Motors                 .98-      1.2
10/16 G     Gillette                       .30       1.3
10/14 MER   Merrill Lynch                  .56       1.5

The first is Intel (INTC).  The semiconductor powerhouse had
rallied ahead of its earnings report Tuesday night (10/13) and
closed at $83.88.  What's interesting is that they beat the
street's estimate by 9 cents and yet the stock gapped down
the next morning (10/14).  And despite the 330 point Dow rate
cut rally on Thursday (10/15), the stock had trouble taking
out its recent previous high of $85.88.  Here, our sentiment
analysis alerted subscribers that expectations had gotten
ahead of itself and that despite the good news, the stock had
trouble advancing.

We saw the opposite in the case of Pfizer (PFE).  This blue
chip Pharmaceutical company had sold off more than 20% from
its summer high ($120) to close at $95.50 before its release
Tuesday night (10/13).  Here, Pfizer actually missed its
estimated earnings by a nickel.  Although the stock initially
gapped down the next morning, it quickly rallied and closed
higher. Our message: it's all about understanding and
managing expectations.


Pinnacle Index

What is the Pinnacle Index.  It is simply the put/call ratio
at key overhigh benchmark levels.  Typically, there should be
two (2) calls for every one (1) put.   So when this ratio
reaches extremes levels, it can presage key turning points in
the stock.  The average Pinnacle Index, therefore, should read 2.0.

One of the key components that separate OptionInvestor.com
from any other advisory services is our sentiment indicator
or Pinnacle Index.  The Pinnacle Index is designed to measure
the level of overhead resistance at key overhead benchmark
levels. This analysis can give savvy option traders a jump on
other traders.

It's important to note that the Pinnacle Index, like many
sentiment indicators, is a contrarian indictor.  This means
that the stock can and will go higher or lower despite what
our sentiment indicators might suggest.  However, our
experience has shown that the market is subject to a
precipitous sell-off if the Pinnacle Index reaches extreme
levels.
