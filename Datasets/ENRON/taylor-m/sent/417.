I like to leave for London at least a day earlier than absolutely necessary 
so I have a day to get adjusted to the time change - otherwise you get off 
the plane and go straight to the office (with a shower on the way if you're 
lucky) and I'm exhausted at that point.  I don't ever sleep well on the 
plane.  This time I'm leaving on Friday afternoon to stop in NY for a party 
Friday night and then leaving for London from there on Sat. night.  Since the 
company pays for business class, there's no savings for going over the 
weekend.  I could get a free companion ticket for T but he's never been able 
to get off work at the same time I have to go.

The rest of our August is a bit hectic, too.  Next weekend T has a swim meet 
in San Francisco and I leave that Mon. night to spend the rest of the week in 
S. America. The following weekend we had tentatively set a trip to Laguna 
Beach but I think it's been canceled for lack of funds if not just so I can 
catch my breath.  We leave on our big trip to Europe (Germany, Belgium & the 
Netherlands) on the 26th and don't get home til 9/12.

I have to pack tonight so I think we'll pass on the film.  I hope we get a 
chance to get together some time in the next few weeks - maybe a weeknight 
dinner some time since the weekends look pretty full?
