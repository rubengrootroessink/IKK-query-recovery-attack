Hey Marc - 

I'm here - it's actually nice to be home & not traveling for a while.  Will 
you guys be around this weekend?

It doesn't look like I can help your friend.  We almost never hire lawyers 
fresh out of law school.  Believe it or not, they don't really teach you how 
to be a lawyer in law school so passing the bar is just the first step.  Your 
first job is where your real training takes place.  We just don't have the 
time and capacity to train junior lawyers so we try to hire people who have 
worked for a number of years (usually at least 5 or 6) at a good law firm.  
They get good training there and we don't have to hassle with it.

Mark,
What's up???  Don't know if you need any attorneys, but a friend of G & mine
just got his law degree and took the bar (will find out in about 4 weeks if he
passed)... he has an engineering degree and currently works for NASA (don't 
even
ask what he does, i don't know, but he can drink alot).  does Enron need any
Atty/Engineers?

how is your world?  you in the states this week?
