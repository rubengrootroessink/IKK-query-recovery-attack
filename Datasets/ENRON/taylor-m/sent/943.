I realized after I had sent the Koch confirmation to you (but before I faxed 
it to Koch) that I might have given too much away by using the Effective Date 
as the Buyer Payment Date.  In the version I send to Koch I will change that 
to Trade Date.  You can always change it to a later date if you want to 
tomorrow.
