Subject: Affiliate Setoff Language

Elizabeth and Leslie:
Enclosed is the setoff langauge that we put into our financial master 
agreements.  Most of our counterparties agree to this, but from our "utility" 
counterparties we consistently get the comment that from a regulatory 
standpoint, they cannot agree to the "Affiliate" lnaguage that is in here 
which I have highlighted.   Does this sound plausible to you and if so, why?  
Are there some utilility counterparties that could agree to this?
Carol
