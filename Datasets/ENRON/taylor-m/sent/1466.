have received, Chinese wall must stand.

I am aware there is information that EnronCredit is not allowed to see. 
However as far as I can tell, the RAC website contains other counterparty 
information like E-ratings that we are allowed to see, and it is that 
information that I would like to get access to.

Regards

Tomas

Tomas,

EnronCredit.com is prohibited from access to counterparty trade positions per 
instructions from legal. That, in short, means you can't see counterparty 
exposures, or CAS. Bryan asked earlier this year for him and Markus and we 
had to give them the same response.

As to access to the RAC site, you should have general access to public data. 
I'll have to check with Mark Taylor about your access to other info. 

Debbie

Would it be possible for my group and myself to get logins to the RAC 
intranet site and trader view of CAS.

Many thanks

Tomas
