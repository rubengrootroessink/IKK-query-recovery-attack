All:  I spoke with Kim this morning and although she is anxious to meet 
everyone, we decided that it would be more productive to try to schedule a 
luncheon meeting to discuss current issues related to the confirmation desk.  
I understand that Joe Hunter, Melissa Murphy and David Dupre will be 
providing Kim with a list of "issues" and we have been invited to add to that 
list.

Please send me your list of any confirmation issues that you would like 
raised with Kim which I will cumulate and forward.

You may ignore the message below.  Thanks.  Sara
