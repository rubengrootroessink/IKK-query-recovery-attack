Tana forwarded the following message on to me since she will be out of the 
office for the next week or so. 

We are not familiar with any of these companies or their activities or 
operations.  You might want to check with Kate Cole's office to see what she 
knows.

Ed

Please note that each of the following companies will be a new controller of 
EEFT as a result of the reorg:

Enron Power Trading Limited (UK)
Enron Europe Limited (UK)
Enron Europe LLC (US)
Enron Power Corp (US)
Enron Europe Inc  (US) - the new US holding company.

For each company we will need to find out the following info which will need 
to be notified to SFA:

1. Principal activities

2.  Date and place of incorporation and registered number

3.  Names of directors and their dates of birth

4.  Address of head/principal office and telephone number

5.  Regulatory Authorities or Exchanges in the UK or overseas of which the 
entity is or has been a member.

Most of this info is pretty basic, but I suspect 1 &5 could be slightly 
tricky (for 1 we only need to list the principal activity or activities).

Lin, Kate and Tana: 2 of these entities are UK and 3 US incorporated. I'd be 
very grateful if you would assist Edmund in putting this information 
together. It will need to be filed with SFA (the UK regulator) at the 
beginning of next week.

Many thanks in advance for your assistance

Paul
