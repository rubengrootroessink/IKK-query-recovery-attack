Mark:

 Just a brief note to follow up with additional information regarding the 
Global Information Site mentioned by Mr. Fishkin, and my comments to that 
section.   As I mentioned in my memo, Sheri Cromwell has been gathering data 
and working with the Internet group to come up with the initial draft for the 
ECT Legal website.    Sheri completed the first draft last Friday and asked 
me who will need to be involved in the review and approval of this 
information.  I mentioned to Sheri that you and Tana were working on a 
special project and that one of the goals was to create a Global Information 
Site or something similar, and that I had mentioned to you as well that she 
was gathering some data for that particular purpose.

 I'm not sure what your plans are regarding the Intranet Site, but since 
Sheri has already done this work I thought I would let you know in case you 
and Tana are interested in talking to Sheri and reviewing her work.  Sheri 
has a lot of good ideas and she seems to enjoy project development 
responsibilities, not to mention that she's had the opportunity to establish 
good relationships with the Internet team.   

Thanks.
Nony
