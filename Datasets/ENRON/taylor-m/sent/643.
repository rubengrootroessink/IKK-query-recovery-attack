I suggest you insert "with respect to the Transactions" after the word 
"Counterparty" in the second line of paragraph 1.  Otherwise they look great 
to me.

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
SOLICITOR-CLIENT COMMUNICATION

Attached are:

1. the revised Termination Agreement with BMO; and
2. the draft Termination Agreement with Banque Paribas.

With respect to the BMO Termination Agreement once the deal is finalized, I 
only require:

1. the Agreement date;
2. the Effective Date;
3.  the payment amount; and
4. the payment date.

With respect to the Paribas Termination Agreement, I will need the same 
information, as well as to confirm the date of the ISDA Master and deal 
identification numbers/legs and to obtain copies of the Confirmation 
Letters.  I will try to track down this ancillary information today, but I 
realize it is U.S. Thanksgiving.  Otherwise, I will follow-up Monday morning.

Regards, Peter
