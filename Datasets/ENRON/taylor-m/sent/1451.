		 Subject: Capacity Trading Policy

Mark,

Further to the requirement to send an email to the desk heads informing them 
of the policy not to access NNG Capacity trade information, do you think the 
following will suffice?



Subject: NNG Capacity Trading

Body:

Please note that as of Monday, October 30, Northern Natural Gas will commence 
transacting for capacity on EnronOnline. In accordance with FERC 
requirements, employees of Enron North America must not use  have commercial 
information with regard to NNG activities which is not in the public domain.

For at least the next several months, NNG will be using EnronOnline and 
sharing the same database. We have agreed a policy with NNG legal that ENA 
employees will not use  obtain commercial information with regard to NNG 
activities which is not in the public domain. Accordingly, you are not 
permitted to access such information.  Attempts to access such information 
may be monitored and will be considered a violation of the policy.if you 
become aware of the existence of any such information, please adhere to the 
policy.

Dave
