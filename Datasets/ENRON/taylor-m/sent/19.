Subject: Fax re Martindale-Hubbell listing


Just to clarify what I need from you:

1.  Make any changes for the folks in your group, ECT-Financial Trading, on 
the list I sent you, including e-mail addresses; and

2.  Have any NEW attorneys (Mark Elliott, Elizabeth Sager, Paul Simons and 
Shari Stack) fill out the Professional Biographies Form (attached to the back 
of the fax I sent yesterday); and

3.  Return any changes and Professional Biographies forms to me (Room 4804a) 
no later than Tuesday, December 1, 1998.

Thanks!

Sara
