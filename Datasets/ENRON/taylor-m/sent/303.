Sylvia:

I have been unable to reach either Jeff Keeler or Maureen McVicker to talk 
about this today.  I'm a little worried about who is handling the 
Commissioner's itinerary at this point and I don't know if anyone has 
reserved a conference room for the 2:30 meeting.  Fred Lagrasta is now also 
supposed to attend and will have a short presentation to make (I don't know 
if he needs any audio/visual equipment).  Can you check on this - maybe 
somebody else in Jeff Keeler's, Steve Kean's, or maybe even Ken Rice's office 
will know where this is supposed to take place?  It is entirely possible that 
no one has reserved a room yet.  If you could do that and then let the 
attendees know where it will be, I'd appreciate it.  Unfortunately, I'm on my 
way out to the airport now and can't take care of this myself.

Thanks for your help!

Mark T.
