Nony:

I will be participating, possibly with Brent Hendry (Brent - are you 
available?), from Buenos Aires.  Will we need to set up a conference call so 
that both London and B.A. can be connected?  It's also possible that Martin 
will be back in Oslo by then.  I'm not sure what his plans are re 
participating.

Regarding the agenda, I would appreciate an update from someone on the 
internet trading plans in Europe.  In particular, I'm wondering if there are 
enforceability/statute of frauds type issues in Europe like we might face 
here and what research has been done to date in that area.  Since at least 
one of us will be on the line from Argentina, we might do a quick update on 
some of the significant problems we are having with the regulators there.

Mark
