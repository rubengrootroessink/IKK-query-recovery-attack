Thanks for your note.  

If you are still trying to decide about shore excursions, I was just 
remembering my trip and have the following observations:

I found the volcano on the Big Island to be marginally interesting, not 
particularly pretty, and from where I was staying (Kona), a very long day.

Kauai was very beautiful - the Na Pali coast is particularly spectacular 
(that coast and the nearby beaches are where South Pacific was filmed) but it 
is quite rugged and nearly inaccessible as I remember it except on foot or by 
boat.  I would highly recommend seeing it by boat if that option is 
available, otherwise, you can just drive up to the end of the road and get a 
pretty good view.  There is also a river boat trip I didn't get to take so I 
can't recommend it - it was popular with visitors.

I didn't make it to Maui but I've always thought it would be fun to go to the 
top of the mountain to watch the sunrise (in a car or bus) and then ride down 
the hill on a bicycle.  

There was a bay near Honolulu on Oahu (near Diamond Head) where I did my 
first-ever snorkeling.  It was very popular (crowded) but a lot of fun and 
while there were plenty of fish to see the reef itself was pretty dead (not a 
lot of pretty coral).

I found the web site for the dolphin lab where I worked but a quick look 
didn't indicate they have a visitors center.  You might call them when you 
are there if you have the extra time and want to go.

As far as your clothes are concerned, since you won't have to carry them 
yourselves, why not  take them all!

Have a great trip!

Love, Mark
