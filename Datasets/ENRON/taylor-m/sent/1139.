Outside counsel reviewed EnronOnline content such as the FAQ, Legal and 
Privacy Statement and anything else we were concerned might create the basis 
for an agreement regarding how the site was used.  We reviewed everything 
else internally.

Mark -- to what extent was outside counsel involved in the review of the 
information on the EOL website?  The ClickPaper.com website is coming 
together and we want to get outside counsel to review it if that is 
consistent with how you handled EOL.
