Hi Marc - 

I just got back from London last night.  Looks like our IT people found out 
about this yesterday too - don't know if it hit us or not but they made 
everybody log off & back on again during the day yesterday - I'm assuming 
that was to install a new virus shield.  Didn't affect me since I wasn't here 
anyway. 

 How've you been?
