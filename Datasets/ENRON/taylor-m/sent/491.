ALTERNATIVE HOME PAGE TEXT - FIRST PARAGRAPH ONLY

Old First Paragraph:
Welcome to EnronOnline, the world=01,s first Web-
enabled system for wholesale buying and selling the=20
full range of energy products and much more.

Comments:
1) The location of the word "wholesale"  makes this gramatically incorrect
2) "and much more" sounds rather clich,d.


Proposed First Paragraph:
Welcome to EnronOnline, the world=01,s first Web-
based system enabling companies to buy and sell
the full range of wholesale energy products online.


Advantages:
1) Gramatically correct
2) Explicitly reinforces that EnronOnline is for "companies" not individual=
s=20
who happen to surf to the Home Page and might otherwise think they can=20
buy/sell energy themselves
3) Extra word "online" at the end for emphasis and clarity.
