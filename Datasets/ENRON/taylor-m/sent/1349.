The latest PA is online.  I have printed out a copy of the current version 
and sent it to Alan.

Hi guys,

Louise was concerned that CommodityLogic might not have borrowed the latest 
edition of EOL documents for use on the CommodityLogic website.  Could I 
please ask you two to ensure that we are using the latest legal stuff.  I am 
not sure who actually holds the definitive copy of the latest EOL legal 
docs...

Thanks very much,

Tom
