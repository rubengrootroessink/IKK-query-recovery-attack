That works to make it more bilateral.  I think we still have the fundamenta=
l=20
problem that it is a basically flawed concept.  But that's not going to be=
=20
fixed by drafting.

I think we need for this to be reciprocal -although I agree the errors are=
=20
likely to be only our own.

Therefore, I suggest the following:

(f) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, any master agreement o=
r=20
any GTC to the contrary, any Transaction resulting from a Gross Error may  =
be=20
voided and the parties agree that any such voided Transaction shall be of n=
o=20
force or effect.  =01&Gross Error=018 shall mean the posting of any price t=
hat is=20
[5]% or more above or below then prevailing market prices, which difference=
=20
is verified by the average of quotations from three or more participants in=
=20
the relevant market for Transactions which would be conducted at the time o=
f=20
the Transaction containing the Gross Error. For a Transaction to qualify as=
=20
subject to Gross Error, one party must communicate by facsimile to the othe=
r=20
the claimed existence of Gross Error within [3] hours of the Transaction=20
occurring.=20


What do you think?
