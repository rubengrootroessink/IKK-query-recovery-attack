Sorry we've been out of touch lately.  We were on vacation (sailing in the 
Virgin Islands) the week of Thanksgiving and were pretty busy getting ready 
for it the week or two before that.  There was a big swim meet in San Antonio 
last weekend that T wanted to see so we drove out for that (yawn).

I didn't even know you were leaving BA!  I knew you had been sort of looking 
around for a while but didn't realize you had made a decision.  What's the 
story?

We're planning to have people over (it's the egg nog time of year) on the 
18th - I'm guessing 8 - 10 pm but we'll let you know the details.
