It may be that you don't need to be there at all.  This relates to the online 
trading system that is being built and the legal review of various pieces of 
the system.  If you haven't been involved yet, it probably means that 
somebody else (maybe Wayne, Harry or Janice?) is responsible for the 
commodities you handle.  The project is only confidential in that we're 
trying to minimize information outside of Enron about it.  There's no problem 
talking about it internally.  You're certainly welcome to attend if you want 
to find out more about it, but if somebody else in your group is already 
covering things, you don't need to worry about it.

I have a meeting at 10:00 am that could interfere with the presentation, but 
I won't know for sure until I see how long the meeting lasts. It has been 
difficult to schedule and the originators are very anxious that it take 
place, so I don't think I can cancel it. I confess I don't understand what 
the presentation is about, and your message did not make sense to me. Perhaps 
because I have not been involved in trading transactions. Can you give me a 
clue without breaching the confidential nature of the project/demonstration?
