Here is the e-mail we received from ISDA.  Since we only have $500 left and 
they are suggesting $1000 for the lunch, I'm not sure it makes sense to send 
someone.  I've left a voice-mail for Stacey to ask where they stand and 
whether or not they still want us to send someone.

Hello Mark and Mark -- Any chance of Enron contributing to the Lugar event
on Monday, March 27th?  If so, are either of you available to come to D.C.
for the event?  I think it owuld be great to have you there particularly
since we still need to nail down treatment of energy products.

I have attached event details.  Thanks!
