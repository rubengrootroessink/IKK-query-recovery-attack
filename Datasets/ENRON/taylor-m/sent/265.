FYI: One of our legal consultants has mentioned that another of his clients 
is setting up an internet derivatives trading system.  They are using an 
outfit called Intuitive Products International based in New York and London 
to assist with system design.  Tana Jones (x33399) will be setting up a demo 
by these folks with our legal department needs in mind - if you'd like to 
attend, we'd be happy to have you and ask them to expand their presentation 
to include internet trading.
