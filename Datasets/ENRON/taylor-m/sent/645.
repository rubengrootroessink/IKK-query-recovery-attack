David, As long as the long descriptions have not changed and the traders are 
fine with the short description changes as being clearer, I have no problems 
with the changes on the financial side.  Stacy will respond on the physical 
gas side.

Subject: New Short Descriptions

Please find attached a spreadsheet showing the new descriptions and some 
samples of the old descriptions (I have to match these by hand, so it is not 
a comprehensive list).

The changes are:

1) Re-ordering of the elements
2) Shortening the index/location description to something which is more 
recognizeable to the traders (and our customers)

We would like to be showing these short descriptions to customers on Monday, 
so your response/input is needed today.

Sorry about the short notice - we're all in the same boat on this one.




Dave
