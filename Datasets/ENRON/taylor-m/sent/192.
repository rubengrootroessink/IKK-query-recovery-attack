Hey Bob - 

Her name is Kartini Muljadi.  I haven't done a good job of staying in touch 
but the last numbers I have for her are:

Phone: 62-21-525-6968
Fax: 62-21-525-5561

If those don't work, you might check with Yao who has stayed in touch with 
one of the other lawyers in that firm.  He has moved over to Enron  
International where he is responsible for their African legal affairs.  I 
know he is out of town (in Africa) right now and unfortunately I'm not sure 
if his e-mail address has changed.  His phone number is the same - maybe his 
secretary could put you in touch with him.

Good luck!

Mark
