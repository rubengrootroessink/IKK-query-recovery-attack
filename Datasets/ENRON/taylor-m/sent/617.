Here's the current forecast for Lenny.  Shouldn't be  a major problem for us 
but I feel for folks scheduled to go down there tomorrow and Thursday.

Bruce - we're still keeping our fingers crossed that your permit will come 
through.  Are you sure you've got the right lawyer working on this?  Seems 
like he ought to be able to shake it loose somehow.  Anything at all we can 
do from here?
