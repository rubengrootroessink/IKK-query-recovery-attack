Sally did not realize that the recommendations as drafted had referred to the 
master agreement process at all.  She indicated that if she had noticed that 
she would have deleted the reference and will revise the recommendations to 
that effect now.  The net result is that the only change regarding financial 
trading documentation will be to designate someone on the confirmation desk

coordinate with Peggy Hedstrom.
