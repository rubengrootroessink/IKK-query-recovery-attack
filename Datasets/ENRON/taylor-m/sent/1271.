We should probably start thinking about an agenda for this meeting if only so 
that we can determine appropriate attendees and get it on their calendars.  
Do you have anything in particular in mind?  Were you thinking 
legal/regulatory/operations/business/marketing?

Hope you're having a fun weekend!
