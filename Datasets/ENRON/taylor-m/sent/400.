We will try to get to all the priorities, but will not likely be able to 
complete everything today.  If anyone wants to change the order of priorities 
or add to the list please let me know so we can discuss our schedule.

We are waiting for comments on the following documents which are listed in no
particular order:
1.  Preparation of modification to Bagley addendum for delivery after payment
(Bagley reviewing proposal)
2.  Y2K mission critical plan and meetings (Brent to co-ordinate)
3.  Total MOU for Austral Basin (Waiting for executed copies to come back
from cp)
4.  Vandenfil (waiting for financials)
5.   Minera Alumbrera power swap or power sale (waiting for further
information on proposal)
6.  VW gas termsheet  (Draft prepared that needs review, now on hold) 7.  
Bagley meeting to discuss ENARGAS issue (John to arrange for Andrea and
Guillermo to be a part of meeting)
8.  Power offer for ICI  (sent to cp for review)
9.   Seeking return of final portion of deposit on Scott Porter's and Bill 
Butler's apartments.
10. YPF on new stamp tax proposal (pending execution)

12.  Preparing drafts for possible restructuring for four Demand Marketing

I am also still working on another draft of the Broker Agreement format but 
it is low on my priority list at the moment.   ECT is also in the process of 
a trading contract audit which we will participate in (this will give us an 
opportunity to try and finalise our various contract forms for review in 
Houston).  Based on comments from Guillermo Canovas and EI litigation 
managers I need to review the dispute resolution provisions in all our 
contracts.
