Thanks for your concern but please don't worry about it.  I was able to get a 
lot accomplished since I was already here and the phones weren't ringing so 
it was a productive morning for me in any event.  I don't think I'm available 
for any of the remaining Saturdays this year but I'll give it another shot 
next time.

Mark,
I want to apologize once again for having you come out on Saturday morning to 
help with interviews and find out that you were not needed.  I appreciate 
your support and cooperation and on behalf of the Associate and Analyst 
Programs would like to give you a shirt  to demonstrate such.  Please let me 
know what size you wear.  You will have to guard this shirt with your life 
because many interviewers have been asking for them and we have not been 
giving them out :).

Again, I am sorry for any inconvenience we caused you and promise not to let 
it happen again.

Thanks for your continued support. 
Charlene Jackson
