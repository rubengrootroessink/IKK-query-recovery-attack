Thanks for your note.  Of the three you have listed, #1643 is probably a bit 
far from public transport for me.  #1671 is convenient to the business I have 
on Mon. & Tues. (what is Double SS?).  #1966 sounds like a fun location.  I'd 
be willing to spend more for a place that is particularly well furnished or 
interesting (any loft spaces?).
