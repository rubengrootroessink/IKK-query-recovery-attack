Subject: New Product Type - Approval Request

I have created the following new Product Type in the Data Manager:

US East Power Phy Firm ICAP

Please go into the DataManager and indicate your approval. If you have any 
questions concerning the Product Type, please DO NOT REJECT it, rather call 
me instead.

I have attached a full description of the Product that will be built under 
this Product Type for your review.
