Subject: Auction Procedures



Attached is a draft of the Auction Procedures we discussed.  Because I don't 
know how the auction page will be configured, it is likely that conforming 
changes will be necessary.  Also, I have left the references to "Enron" in 
brackets; I am not sure if a specific entity will be referenced or if all 
entities will be defined collectively as "Enron".  Please call or e-mail with 
any questions or comments.  Best regards.
