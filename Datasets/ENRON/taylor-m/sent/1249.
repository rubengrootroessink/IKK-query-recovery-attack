I talked to Kathy, gave her some basic advice to relay on the subject and 
told her that if Alcoa has further questions they can call me.  One issue for 
you - do you know whether or not we have a power master of some kind with 
Alcoa and did we need to send them an override letter?

Received a call this morning from Tim Reyes with Alcoa.  He is wanting to 
find out if his master contract will come into play when utilizing 
EnronOnline.  He is also wanting to add products to his master if they are 
not currently included.  He was hoping to talk with someone today.

I know that master contracts are utilized by EnronOnline but customer wanted 
to know what products his master covered.  He also mentioned that he did not 
have a copy of the master contract between Enron and Alcoa.

Thanks for your help.
