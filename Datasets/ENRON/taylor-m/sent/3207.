Mark, I am getting complaints by traders and orginators that  they are 
missing significant commercial opportunities, especially in our newly 
deregulated power market, as they are unable to get ISDAs turned around.  
Frankly, I do not know what is the cause for the delay, or whether it is 
Legal, Credit or Enron Corp. Legal, or the specific cases.  I do know that 
Enmax Energy Corp. and Encore Energy Solutions are two specific cases on the 
power side.  Can you look into this and let me know if we (Legal) can speed 
up the process.

TX, Peter.
