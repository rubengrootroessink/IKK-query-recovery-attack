Yes, silly me.  But just so there's some hope that Bill makes his flight 
back, we should plan on being in the general vicinity of Tortola on the day 
of his flight.

It turns out I need everybody's birthday and address.  I assume you're still 
at 200 W 86th but don't know your birthday.

Plans.  You were thinking there would be planning involved?  Silly you.

I don't think I knew we were making a mid-week drop at the airport.  We
need to remember that as we plan where we'll be.
