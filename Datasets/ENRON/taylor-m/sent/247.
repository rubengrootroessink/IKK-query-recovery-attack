I think we are doing Hawaiian shirts - we just don't want everyone to know 
yet.  Yes - please include all the offices - also include Singapore & Buenos 
Aires.  Tana will let you know which people in the London office will be 
coming.

Suzanne:

Please send an e-mail to all of the lawyers and paralegals in the ECT Legal 
Dept. asking them to reserve the conference dates and asking them to let you 
know their t-shirt sizes.   Once you have everyone's t-shirt sizes, please 
give the list to Dan.

Thanks,

Mark
