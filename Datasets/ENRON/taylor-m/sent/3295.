Shari Stack has resigned but Marcus Nettelton has been appointed to take over 
from the physical power side.  I'll sit down with him today and get him up to

We should have the first one out Monday if we can get legal to sign off. 
Apparently the person handling long descriptions for physical products quit 
and we have no replacement to look at the descriptions.
