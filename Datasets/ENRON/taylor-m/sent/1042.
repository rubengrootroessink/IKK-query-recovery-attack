Sorry I missed you earlier - please blame Louise who refused to let me leave 
the meeting I was in with her to call.  I tried to call you in London just 
now but there was no answer.  If you are still around, please feel free to 
try me again but if that doesn't work I will be in all next week and am happy 
to set up a time that works for you.

Mark
