Any chance this language came from a credit facility that provides for the 
issuance of letters of credit?

Mark,

I copied a section of a counterparty's Bank Credit Agreement relating to 
certain 
negative pledges.  The counteparty is IMC Global whom we have some financial 
transactions with (actuall their sub IMC-Canada) at ECC, and now an EES 
person is looking to 
enter into a long term EES transaction.  We sent them a draft ISDA for future 
transactions 
out of ECC and we are now being told by the EES person that if a Credit 
Support Annex (CSA) 
is required in this ISDA it will kill her deal.  She has stated that they are 
not able 
to fulfil the obligations of the CSA because of the covenants tied to their 
Credit 
support agreement.  As highlighted in red below, it seems that they cannot 
have any liens that
secure derivative obligations, although cash is acceptable up to $10 
million.  Can you 
please clarify if collateral as it is stated in the ISDA is considered a 
lien, and if this type 
collateral would be a breach of their credit agreement.  If this is a breach 
can you suggest 
other methods that we might use so the CSA would be acceptable.

Thanks
Russell
