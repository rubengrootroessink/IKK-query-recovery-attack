I have enlisted the assistance of Carol St. Clair to handle the ETA comments 
and negotiations.  I will be meeting with her this afternoon to go over the 
details of what we have been doing so far.  It would make sense for you to 
meet her at some point in the near future.  She is not a junior lawyer by any 
stretch and should be able to handle most issues that come up with minimal 
assistance.  In fact, as she becomes more familiar with EOL and its 
structure/issues generally, she will make a great back-up for me for all EOL 
issues.

We are experiencing an high level of cusotmers wishing to speak to a lawyer 
on the EnronOnline agreements and bearing in mind you have other jobs we need 
to have someone permanently manning the phone for all the industrials.  Could 
you get another Edmund type working for you who mans the phones permanently 
so we can get people on the system immediately.

Thanks

Louise
