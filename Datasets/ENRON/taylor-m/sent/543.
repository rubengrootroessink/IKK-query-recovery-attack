Today's simulation has been postponed to next Wednesday.  Unfortunately, they 
have not yet opened the system to the entire web - you have to be on the 
Enron intranet to get access.  If you want to see it badly enough, I might be 
able to arrange something for you in our NY office (midtown) otherwise I'll 
let you know when they roll it out onto the web.
