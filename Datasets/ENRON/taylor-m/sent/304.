Jeff:

In preparation for his meetings with Commissioner Newsome and Congressman 
Stenholm, Mark H. has asked for  information including a bullet point list of 
our key issues and any appropriate background material.  I have prepared a 
draft issues list which is attached.  Would you please take a quick look at 
it and see if there is anything you think should be added and then forward it 
on to Mark?  He probably also needs the final itineraries.  Thanks for your 
help.

Mark T.
