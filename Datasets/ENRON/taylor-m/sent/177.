International E-Fare Facts

E-Fares are only valid for round-trip travel on United Airlines, and are
restricted to the flights and dates indicated.  One-way travel, stopovers,
and standby travel are not permitted.

E-Fares are valid only for travel originating in the city or cities indicated.

International E-Fares are not eligible for any type of upgrade to a
higher class of service.

It is the passenger's responsibility to be in possession of all necessary
documentation for the destination country (valid passport, visa, etc.) at
the time of departure. United reserves the right to deny boarding to
passengers without the proper documentation.

Seats are limited and may not be available on all flights/dates. Offer is
for a very limited time and is subject to change without notice.
Reservations must be made using United's website at least one day
prior to travel. Tickets require immediate purchase by credit card when
reservations are made. Ticketing will be electronic (E-Ticket) where
applicable. Otherwise tickets must be picked up at a United Airlines
City Ticket Office or at an airport location within 48 hours of making
the reservations or on the day of departure, whichever is earlier. Credit
card owner must be present to show the credit card used to purchase
the ticket as well as a valid picture ID.

Tickets are non-refundable, but a wholly unused ticket may be applied
toward future travel on United Airlines for a USD 75 service fee.
E-Fares are only available for travel on or after the date of purchase
and will not be honored retroactively or in conjunction with the
exchange of any wholly or partially unused ticket.

Changes to flight date, flight number and routing are not permitted. In
the event of a flight cancellation, customers will, at United's option,
either be re-accommodated on another United flight or be issued a
refund, but will not be accommodated on another airline's flights.

International fares may be subject to government approval.

Fares are subject to U.S. departure, agricultural, immigrations, customs
and security taxes/surcharges of up to USD 47. For travel to some
countries, additional airport, transportation, embarkation, security, duty,
equalization, passenger service and noise taxes/surcharges of up to
USD 35 will apply depending on the destination and may vary slightly
depending on currency exchange rates at the time of purchase. For
return travel from some countries, fares do not include airport and/or
departure taxes of up to USD 37 which may be collected by the foreign
government at time of departure.

Fares do not include Passenger Facility Charges of up to $12 per
round-trip which may be collected depending upon the itinerary.

Fares cannot be combined with any other United Airlines or other
airlines' discount, coupon, or promotional offers.
