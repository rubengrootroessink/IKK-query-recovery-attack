Mark:

After our last discussion from Friday I thought I would outline the next 
Steps as I see them:

? Establish a corporate entity as a sub of Enron Corp. to conduct business 
under.
? Develop a consulting contract (Sample sent to you by Cassandra Schultz)
? Develop a confidentiality agreement from sample provided.
? Price Professional Liability Insurance based on contract provided.
? Hold off customers until said items are in place.
