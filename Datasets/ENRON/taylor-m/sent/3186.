Hi Tana,

We are going to talk with a company with the legal name
The Patent & License Exchange, Inc. 

about the possibility of 
? adding some of Enron's tools (DealBench) to their site's functionality
? creating new tools for their site
? writing derivative instruments based on their site's patent inventory 
? securitizing patents

Can you please forward an NDA today?

Thanks!
