I'm headed to South America next week.  Any particular issues you think I 
need to be aware of or anything you want me to look into?

Subject: Policy Changes

The proposed changes to the Risk Management Policy have been approved today 
as requested without amendement by the Board of Directors.
The changes can be implemented as of close of business today (8/10/99).  I 
will forward the revised policy to you asap.
Please let me know if there are others that you wish to inform of those 
changes.
FYI - the next Board meeting is to be held October 12th.  The deadline for 
submission of materials is Monday September 27th.
Thanks 
Ted
