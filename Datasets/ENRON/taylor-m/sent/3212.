FYI - It does not appear that either the House or Senate Judiciary
Committees are willing to entertain modifications to bankruptcy reform
legislation during this week's mark-ups.

Two meetings are scheduled for next week on bankruptcy reform.

1. Tuesday, February 20, 2001, 2:00 p.m. Treasury Department - We plan to
meet with Dina Ellis and other Treasury officials to discuss bankruptcy
reform amendments.

2. Wednesday, February 21, 2001, 1:00 p.m. Room 2222 Rayburn House Office
Building.  Greg Zerzan of the House Financial Services Committee has
requested a meeting with us and various administration officials at
1:00pm on Wednesday.

Attendees of the Treasury meeting will need to provide us with their date of
birth.  Please contact Frank Hampton at 202-434-8400 or Stacy Carey at
202-457-6545 if you are interested in attending either of the meetings.
