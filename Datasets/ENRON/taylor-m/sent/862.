Oops - that was supposed to be AT&T - Lucent is the one that lasts forever 
and deals with the Utility Solutions business.

I have read the Lucent CA and it is OK to go ahead and keep them on the list 
- the CA seems to cover a relatively small transaction and expires on March 
25 anyway.

We are in the process of pulling the CA's for Dow, DuPont, GE, IMC, 3M, 
Pitney Bowes, Praxair and Sprint.
