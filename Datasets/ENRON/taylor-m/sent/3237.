Gentlemen:

Several points regarding the below:

We worked for the first half of 1999 to try and negotiate a master agreement 
with TDCC but failed due to an inability to agree on credit terms (i.e. TDCC 
wouldn't sign a master with ANY credit terms in it at all).  Rod Nelson was 
the Credit Dept. person responsible for this counterparty at that time.
If we want to start down this road again, the first step is to contact 
someone in Credit and have them generate the necessary credit terms for  a 
master agreement.  Unless the commercial folks have already, I'll ask someone 
in my group to get that process started.
The e-mail from Dow indicates:
 "TDCC has never accepted and cannot accept the Terms and Conditions included 
in the
confirmations sent by Enron."
All credit concerns aside, if Dow is not signing and returning our 
confirmations, then based on this statement our derivatives trading with them 
should stop immediately on legal grounds.
The e-mail as forwarded to me did not contain the attachment.  Does someone 
here have it?

Let's hope it works out better this time.

Mark

Mark-

Please see the correspondence below regarding Dow Chemical' s desire to enter 
into an ISDA with us.  

Let us know who will be leading the charge from legal.

Thanks,

John

John/Mike, can someone contact Luis Antuna (name and number below) to discuss 
putting together an ISDA between Dow Chemical Co. and EGM.

Thanks,
Alan

Thanks Luis,

I really appreciate your initiative to document that we have never accepted
and cannot accept their Terms and Conditions.  We are reversing the flow and
will leverage an ISDA Agreement that works for us and for them.

Thanks,
Mike
