They shouldn't be doing any trading so I hope we won't need those things.

I spoke to Kate Cole and she said Enron NetWorks (I'm not sure of the correct 
spelling yet) was incorporated as a Delaware corporation on 4/13/00.  She  
has made me a copy of their articles of incorporation and LLC Agreement and I 
am sending a messenger to pick them up, as well as a copy of the officers and 
directors, which appears to have been approved.  The banking resolution went 
to Julia today for signature.  Do we need to adopt any other resolutions 
(brokerage, approval of agreements, etc.).  How about adoption of the trading 
policy?
