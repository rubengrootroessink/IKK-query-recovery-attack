The pro understands there are only three of us 'golfing.'  Since we needed 
something for Fri. afternoon and you and Amanda seemed interested in the golf 
I went ahead and made the reservation that way.

The manicure was Amanda's idea.  Never having had one, I just assumed they 
dried them for you.  Would you rather have a facial?  I didn't ask about the 
morning.

Do you still want to do golf without Bill?  I think I'd like to do it - the 
pro will probably be happy to lose a body.

I think I will call and cancel the manicure/pedicure.  I think it is too 
tight for me to hurry back to get ready with wet nalis.  You don't happen to 
remember if they had any morning appointments?  I'll call.

Bill doesn't get there until Friday eve. so no golf and I had assumed he
would be with Amanda on Saturday.

We may miss out on tea.  Any idea what the hours are?  We won't be done
with golf on Friday until 4:30 or 5:00.  You won't be finished with your
nails until 4:00 or 4:30 on Saturday (and then there's the law school bbq
and Amanda's do).  I don't know the agenda for Sunday's afternoon.
