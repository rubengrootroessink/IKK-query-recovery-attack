Dear Dave,

Justin and I have had another look at the website and noticed that the old 
Legal & Privacy statement is the one being shown.  The additional language in 
the mark-up below needs to be added before European counterparties access the 
site to trade.

In respect of Finland, we have been in contact with our Finnish legal 
advisers and hope to have the issue resolved (hopefully favourably) today.

Thanks, Edmund.

Dave,

I've now been given access to the Online system, and I've also seen the 
website - it's all looking pretty good.  However, I noticed on reading 
through the Legal & Privacy statement that there is some text missing!! I've 
attached a mark-up showing the missing text (red and bold) which needs to be 
in there.

Regards, Edmund.
