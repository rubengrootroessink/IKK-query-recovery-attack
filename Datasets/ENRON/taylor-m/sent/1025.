We are now able to open these but can't say I'm any happier about it.  Well, 
maybe that's too extreme - at least it seems like a good idea in principle.  
But I do have several questions:  Do we have a similar system here in NA?  
Are we expected to review all of these?  Is there some way to filter out the 
junk?  To whom should I address these questions?
