Subject: Upcoming Seminars

As we discussed last week, we are in the process of scheduling lunch seminars 
with credit, confirms/settlements and global contracts for the following 
dates:

May 5th, 12th and 24th.

Please let Sara and I know ASAP if you plan to be out onh any of these dates 
as we feel that it is very important that you attend.

Tana:
Have you talked to the Global Contracts Group about the 24th?

Carol
