Brent - does this mean Tana should not allow any non-Argentine customers to 
have access to these products?  The general rule has been to allow complete 
access unless there was a legal impediment - logic regarding who will want to 
trade what doesn't seem to enter into it.

Enron America de Sur S.A. is the enron entity set up to trade on EOL; Lisa 
Lees will manage the external customer access.

Dale:

I spoke with Jeff Bluementhal earlier today and wanted to confirm the parties 
that should be approved for trading Argentine.  The Enron party that should 
execute Argentine physical gas deals should be Enron America de Sur S.A.  It 
should be noted that all counterparties for this product should be Argentine 
entities.

Regards

Lynn
