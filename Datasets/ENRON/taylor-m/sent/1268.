Mark:  (1)  Did you consider my voice mail about updating authorized trader 
lists and resolutions (by Samantha or Tana)?

(2)  Have you thought about electronic notice provisions?  Shouldn't 
default/termination notices be in writing to the appropriate counsel/Corp. 
secretary?  And, can we agree to "electronic notices" at all?  There is no 
electronic address for a Documentation Desk or Assistant General Counsel.  I 
am seeing this type of provision in electronic trading agreements.

Thanks.  Sara
