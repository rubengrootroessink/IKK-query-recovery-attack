Mark,

I was moved to your CC number  in January, but I'm not sure why since none of 
my assignments are in your group.  Unless something has changed recently, I 
think I'm still under your number.  Should I check with Janette?

Sheri -

I'm not sure this is an issue for me.  Aren't you in Lance's group now?

Mark,

My mouse is not responding properly (left click), and I need to have it 
replaced.  I would like to order the Intellimouse at a cost of $23.

If this meets with your approval, please forward this message to Janette 
Elbertson.  Thanks!
