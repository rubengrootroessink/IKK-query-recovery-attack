Jeff:   As we discussed, ENA Upstream Company, LLC will be trading wellhead 
gas and will need to hedge its risks with Risk Management Trading ("RMT").   
Accordingly, ENA Upstream needs to enter into a Master Swap Agreement with 
RMT.   This ENA Upstream/RMT Master Swap Agreement will have term and 
conditions similar to the current ENA/RMT Master Swap Agreement.   Would you 
please have someone in your group draft the ENA Upstream/RMT Master Swap 
Agreement.   ENA Upstream has begun trading and needs to be this agreement in 
place as soon as conveniently possible.   Please let me know if you have 
questions or need additional information.   Thanks, John.
