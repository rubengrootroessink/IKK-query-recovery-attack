Are either of you guys aware of this web-site?  It looks like our weather 
people have put this out on the web ahead of us.  I think we need to talk to 
them about what they are allowed to post and what sorts of disclaimers should 
be there as well.  I just wanted to check with you before I call the weather 
desk here
