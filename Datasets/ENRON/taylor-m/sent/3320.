Sorry about that Vance - I just missed it.  I don't see any problems here 
either.

Hey Mark -- 

I sent this note on March 23 while you were out of the office.  Robert Jones 
is fine with this opportunity and I just want to double check that you're ok 
also.  

Thanks

Gentlemen -- 

The background on this message from Greg relates to his potential involvement 
in an advisory board for Internet Week magazine.  Essentially, this means 
that Greg would attend a couple of meetings per year and participate in a 
handful of telephone conversations all aimed at helping the editors at 
InternetWeek calibrate themselves in terms of what's important and what's not 
in the technology world.  Here are the advantages I see:

Greg gets to work with several high-level CTO's and technology CEO's who also 
participate on the board.  This is good exposure for our plans to provide IT 
services as a business.
Good exposure in terms of IT recruiting.  The more high-profile places we 
are, the better.
Good media relations and the potential for us to track editorial thought in 
the technology world.

Philippe had originally planned to do it, but I think we're concluding that 
it's a perfect place for Greg to be as part of his efforts to put new 
origination activities in motion.  

From my PR perch, I see no conflicts but Greg is right to suggest that we run 
it by you first.  Ok with you?

I am fine with it.  Talk to Robert Jones in HR and Mark Taylor in legal to 
make sure we understand my committment and that it doesn't conflict with any 
Enron policy, etc. before you do it.

Thanks.

Greg -- 

If you have talked with Philippe and are comfortable with the Internet Week 
advisory board opportunity, I'd like to send them your bio and lock it in.  I 
have a copy of your bio from Kal.

Let me know, and we'll push the button.

Thanks

Vance
