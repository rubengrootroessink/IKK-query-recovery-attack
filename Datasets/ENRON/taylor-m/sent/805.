Dear Schuyler:

It seems to me that you used to chair a seminar put on by the Euromoney
people on swap documentation.  We used to send our new lawyers and more
experienced paralegals to the introductory course and the more
experienced lawyers to the advanced course.  It appears that Euromoney
is no longer putting this on.  Are you doing something similar through
another provider?
