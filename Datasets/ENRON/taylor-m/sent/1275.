Hey guys - welcome home!  At least I assume you're home by now.  How was the 
trip?  I heard a bit about the departure but with any luck it must have 
gotten better.  Any hope you took digital pictures?

I have already told Linda but I wanted you both to know how great I thought 
your wedding was.  There is no doubt in my mind that it was the most special, 
beautiful, fun wedding I've ever been to.  Magical doesn't seem like too 
strong a word.  Thank you very much for letting me be part of it.  It's been 
about 30 years since I had been to that part of the world - it's easy to see 
why you enjoy it so much.  

I was serious about sailing in the Caribbean at Thanksgiving.  If you are 
still interested, we really need to start planning right away.  I tentatively 
booked a boat but the real difficulty may be in finding flights - it is a 
busy travel season.  Just let me know.

Mark
