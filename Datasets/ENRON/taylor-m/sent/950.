I'm not sure - I thought we were not adding any products -- just opening 
existing products to Japanese counterparties.  Is he talking about the 
existing GTC's for petroleum products?

Mark:

Do you know what Joe is talking about when he refers to the EOL contracts for 
the international rollout of petroleum products?

Alan,

Have you had a chance to review the EOL contracts that we will be using in 
Japan for the rollout of the international petroleum products?  If not we 
probably should take a look.  I would also like to have B&M review as well.  
Pls send me a copy when you have this available.  We are shooting to have 
products posted by the end of the month and an official rollout 10-12 May.

While EOL should be ready to go, there could be some complications with FX 
coming from Sydney, commodity prices from Singapore and even help desk 
support from London.

Let's talk about this early on this week.

thanks,

Joe
