Sorry to hear you're having computer problems.  I haven't gotten a virus yet 
but I have had 2 hard drives crash and burn on me -- one at home and one at 
the office -- you definitely loose everything when that happens!  My fairly 
new work computer (the little one you saw at Christmas) started making 
strange noises a couple of weeks ago so I called in the tech support guys.  
They agreed that is sounded odd so they took everything off of my hard drive, 
replaced it with a new one and then put all of my stuff back in the new one.  
Took them a day or so but the weird noises are gone so I feel better.

I'm off to San Antonio this week for a couple of days and then leave for 
sailing on the 11th, returning on the 21st.  The last few days (18 - 21) I'll 
be staying at a place called Keswick Hall in Virginia.  I may be able to send 
that number before I leave.

Love,

Mark
