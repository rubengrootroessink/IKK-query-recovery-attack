Q1: Did you write your web page internally or use an outside company?

A: Enron used an outside company for the web page coding, but the internal 
applications which our traders use for posting their bids and offers were 
built by Enron personnel.


Q2: What is the name of the outside agency which Enron used for web page 
development and how can we contact them?

A: The company which wrote the internet software for EnronOnline is 
Agency.com. 


Q3: Are you satisfied with Agency's performance?

Refer the caller to our PR dept.

Agency, if you approve.

If someone calls the Call Centre and asks if we used an outside vendor for 
the website, and who the vendor is, shall we tell them?

We have received such a query - I want to establish policy.

Thanks,

Dave
