Hey guys!

Wow - 10 acres - sounds like a ranch!  I'm still working at Enron in Houston 
- it's a good size energy company and the subsidiary I work for does a lot of 
trading of electricity and energy commodities like natural gas and oil.  I'm 
in the legal department and work on derivatives trading contracts and 
issues.  I just got promoted a few days ago so I guess things are going well.

I had an e-mail from Paul Palmer a year or so ago and sent a note back but 
haven't heard from him since.  Mark Kopinski & I stay in touch - he's in New 
York managing a couple of international mutual funds.  He & Debbie adopted a 
little girl (Celena) from China and seem very happy living in a high-rise in 
the middle of Manhattan.  I get up there on business a few times a year and 
try to stop in to say hi.

I was in Monmouth for our 20 year class "reunion" last June.  There were only 
2 of us there and I didn't even remember the other guy!  Oh well, maybe the 
25th will be a bigger draw.

C.F.&S.,
Mark
