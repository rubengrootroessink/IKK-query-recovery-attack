You always make me laugh.

Why don't you just pay for you.  You've been footing the bill for Amanda & 
her friends all these years; it's your turn to take a break!

By the way, I don't remember pointing out that she is spoiled - thinking it 
often enough, but not pointing it out.  Of course we both know how my tongue 
loosens and my memory locks up in direct proportion to the volume of alcohol 
consumed.....

speaking of this bucket.  I think it is lovely that you are giving Amanda a 
graduation gift but -  trust me -  should would rather have another pair of 
earrings than have a free seat for me on the boat.  I didn't even know you 
when I graduated so it is much too late to give me a graduation present.  
Won't you let me pay half ( the half of the boat that Bill and I are 
occupying)?  As you have pointed out amanda is too too spoiled.

Did anyone get you a yacht when you graduated?

An extra $200 is just a drop in this bucket.   St. Regis sounds good to me.

I am happy to stay at the St Regis at this price but I am also happy to get
a cheap room near the airport.  The price has gone up quite a bit since the
last time I stayed there.

Mark   the cost of the room at St. Regis (Thursday, 5/17/01) for one night
is $286.14 (14.5% tax).  I have booked two separate rooms under Linda's
name.   Let me know if there is anything else I can do.
