PICK NEWS - CALLS (continued)
*******************************************************

MSFT $171.56 +9.69 (+15.31)  Wow!!  It doesn't
get much better than this.  MSFT announced their 2:1 stock
split (effective 3/26) prior to yesterday's market open and
immediately gapped-up at the opening.  Those of you still
in the play going into last weekend were richly rewarded
Monday Morning.  Everyone wants to own MSFT and nobody
wants to sell.  This sentiment on 2 times normal volume
produced a textbook run-up -- as if "astrodollar" earnings
aren't enough.  Price targets are now at $200.  Of note,
MSFT announced they would phase in Alta-Vista, Compaq's to-
be-spun-off-in-an-IPO search engine, and ease out Inktomi.
Use stops to protect your profits.  With so much money on
the table, we suggest waiting for a pullback before
starting a new play.  As always, confirm market direction
first.

DH $60.88 +0.63 (+0.94)  As we said Sunday,
not a fast mover, but a steady gainer. 1189 institutions
own 89.5% of the 395 million shares in float leaving about
40 million shares in daily float to trade.  On average
volume of 2 million shares, DH traded within $1.50 range
both days this week, sheltering investors from a tumultuous
market. Look for the rise to continue, market permitting.
Slow news week so far; nothing to move the price.  Just
hare-speed momentum.  Dayton Hudson is the parent company
of Target Stores

VIA.B $81.88 -1.13 (-0.68)  Profit taking has caused a slight
dip in Viacom.  But, it has been so small that it actually can
be interpreted as a positive sign for the stock.  VIA.B seems
to undergo an occasional consolidation.  Then it goes on its
merry way.  As always, wait for the signal to turn green
before hitting the gas.  Blockbuster Inc., a subsidiary of
Viacom, teamed up with Warner Home Video in a revenue sharing
agreement.   As a result, Blockbuster will be able to rent
more new releases and other videos to its customers.  Chyron
Corporation will deliver Liberty NT software to an affiliate
of Paramount which is partially owned by Viacom.  The new
system will allow access to paint and animation capabilities
on the Windows NT platform.

WAG $59.50 +1.13 (+1.06)  On Tuesday, Walgreen's flexed its
muscles in a display strength and closed at it's high for the
day.  Its only resistance is at it's all time high set back in
December at $60.44.  With its 2:1 stock split scheduled for
Feb. 12th, it appears WAG is getting in shape to make a nice
run.

LXK $108.00 +3.88 (+8.75) Well, we have good news and bad news
on LXK this week.  Let's start with the bad news.  LXK did
not announce a stock split with earnings.  Their annual
shareholder meeting isn't until April, so a stock split
announcement would have to come on an arbitrary day.  We
noticed that companies, like Microsoft, have held off a few
days before announcing their splits.  This might be a ploy
to take the price high on the earnings announcement and then
take it higher with the split announcement.  The good news
is that LXK announced earnings of $1.16 a share.  This was
$.05 above consensus estimates.  The company also stated
there is a high demand for printer components.  LXK is in
blue-sky territory as it has broken through any prior
resistance.

VOD $193.50 +2.88 (+5.12) VOD has come back to life the last
two trading days with gains of $2.88 and $2.24.  There isn't
any recent news on VOD, but there is one very positive
technical aspect.  The last three trading days have seen
VOD close right at the high of the day.  This shows a very
bullish tendency as the bulls seem to be winning the battle
on a daily basis.

XIRC $42.31 +.38 (+.31) XIRC seems to have entered a
consolidation phase.  The volatility was pretty high before
earnings, but the daily range has decreased substantially
the last three trading days.  We still feel this stock is a
good purchase.  Watch for a strong up-move on good volume.
XIRC's 52-week high is at $44.50.  A move through this level
should provide a nice rally.  XIRC did announce today that
they will provide wireless data support for Siemans handsets.

SNC $39.50 +.56 (+1.75) SNC continued to rise today, albeit
at a smaller pace.  No news on SNC, but earnings are around
the 10th of February and SNC has historically had nice
earnings surprises.  There isn't much of a chance of an
upgrade for this stock, being that the five analysts that
follow it all rank it a strong buy.  We guess there could be
a new analyst recommendation.  We could see a continued run
into earnings.  SNC's 52-week high is $54.18.

XLNX $82.56 +5.44 (+4.37) XLNX did the job on Tuesday with
over a 6% gain.  XLNX has done what a lot of stocks do after
announcing great earnings and a stock split and that is to
consolidate briefly and then continue up.  XLNX dropped on
Monday, but came back with a vengeance on Tuesday. XLNX's
resistance is at its 52-week high of $87.63.  Pullbacks
would be good buying opportunities.

MU $71.88 +2.88 (+1.38) Micron showed some weakness on Monday
in a mixed semi-conductor market. It was off $1.50 even as a
few of the other chip stocks moved up in sympathy with LSI
Logic.  LSI had received an upgrade from hold to strong buy.
Today, however, MU was up $2.88 in a generally strong semi-
conductor sector. Any upgrades and strong earnings from other
stocks in the sector, as well as from the hardware stocks,
should help MU.  Like Dell, it reports later in the earnings
season, so an earnings run would start a little later.
Earnings in February.

NOKA $145.38 +1.38 (+.82) After hitting $155.38 on Wednesday,
Jan. 20th, Nokia has gapped down at the open each of the last
four trading days. It has also CLOSED well above its opening
price the last few days, and today it managed to close $1.38
above yesterday's close. This company is located in Finland
and trades in Europe while we sleep. The Europeans seem to be
sending the stock lower while the Americans are sending it
back up each day on the NYSE. Only two days left for an
earnings run--earnings are due out before the bell on Friday.
We believe that there is a good possibility of a split
announcement with earnings. If you don't want to risk holding
over earnings, be sure to sell your options before the close
on Thursday.  You can pick them up again if a split is announced.
That is the conservative way to make this play. If you hold over,
you risk a loss of capital, should Nokia disappoint. For those
of you with high risk tolerance, please note that Nokia jumped
$9 the day it announced it's last split.  It then ran up another
$34 before the split.

ANF - Abercrombie & Fitch $73.94 +2.06 (+4.19 for the week)

Abercrombie & Fitch sells men's and women's casual clothes
and accessories in over 170 stores across America.  Their
comfortable styles of jeans and crews are especially popular
with teens and college students.  Check out this Volkswagen
hip-hop retailer the next time you are strolling through
the mall.

Abercrombie has established a nice upward trend since its
lows in October.  It has been virtually unstoppable with
only two minor bouts of profit taking along the way.  In
intraday trading on Tuesday, ANF set another all-time high
at the $75 level.  Look for ANF to continue its steady trend
into blue skies.  There hasn't been a lot of news as of late
for Abercrombie.  But, back on Jan 8th, an article in Reuters
commented that since American Eagle Outfitters had posted
nice sales figures, it was safe to assume that Abercrombie
could do the same.

SEPR - Sepracor Inc. $104.25 +2.50 (+4.75 for the week)

Sepracor Inc. is a company that researches, develops, and
sells chemicals that are new, patented forms of existing
pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical compounds.  These
products are made to reduce the side effects and increase
the safety of drugs already on the market today.  They are
used to treat several conditions that include asthma,
allergies, pain, and insomnia.  As an example, SEPR
developed Allegra as an alternative to Seldane which lost
FDA approval in 1997.

Sepracor Inc. has a stellar graph.  The company has been on
an uptrend since it was at the $40 level back in June and
in intraday trading Tuesday, SEPR set another all time high
at $105.50.  Last Friday, Jan. 22nd, BancBoston Robertson
Stephens initiated coverage of this steady stock with a
"long-term attractive rating."  They projected a 12-month
price target of $112.  They seem to favor this company which
has two approved drugs and six drugs in late phase clinical
development.  Look for SEPR to continue its upward trek if
current market conditions remain steady.

WMT - Wal-Mart $83.56 +1.56 (+1.56)

The king of retailers is back! Wal-Mart is the leading
discount retailer in the world, with a presence in all 50
states, as well as Canada, Mexico, Asia, Latin America, and
Europe. In addition to discount department stores, it
operates the #2 grocery chain, behind Kroger's, and Sam's
clubs, which is the #2 warehouse chain. This retail giant's
market capitalization is $182.3 billion.

We covered Wal-Mart recently, but dropped it when the stock
began pulling back. It appears to be moving out of a
consolidation phase and has been trending up for a week, with
only one slightly down day in that period. Wal-Mart had a
strong holiday season. It continues to grow at home and also
abroad, partly through acquisitions. It is now growing its
profits faster than its sales once again.

As an option play, WMT is a steady mover. While it lacks the
fast moves of the technology and Internet stocks, it is a
safer play, and has the added advantage of being a split
candidate. The stock last split in February 1993. Its last
three splits occurred when WMT traded in the mid-60s.
Earnings are due out in February.

COMBINATION PLAYS   - Split-O-Rama
*****************************************************

Monday, January 25

U.S. blue-chip stocks ended higher Monday after a volatile day of
trading amid a slew of mixed earnings results from multi-national
companies. The DJIA closed unofficially up 82 points at 9203.32.
The Dow shed 57 points early in the day but recovered as several
big-name companies including AT&T and 3M reported earnings. The
high-flying Nasdaq Index gained 30 points to 2369.11 primarily on
the shoulders of Microsoft shares after the company declared a 2:1
stock split. A report that analysts expect IBM to announce a stock
split after its board meets Tuesday helped Big-Blue reverse a $6
loss from early in the day and close slightly higher at $180.93.
Despite big gains in the Dow and the Nasdaq Composite, breadth on
both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq was negative as
decliners outpaced advancers on both exchanges.

Most of the Sunday plays were available near the recommended entry
points. MRK opened the day around $137 and traded slightly higher
just before 10 AM. The first prices listed for the FEB160C/155C
bear-call spread were around $0.75 credit. EMC was also slow to
start trading and opened slightly higher near $100. Our put-credit
spread; FEB75P/80P did not have any volume but the bid/ask quotes
were within $0.12 of our target entry of $0.50. SKYT was a pair of
plays; the calendar spread, JUN25C/FEB25C was easily opened for
$2.38 debit. The best we saw on the ITM debit spread, FEB22C/25C
was $2.00 (higher than our target) and that was a little slim on
the ROI potential so we decided to pass. PLCM fell hard in a post
earnings dip but that just brought the sold position nearer to ATM
and a higher time component. We decided to take advantage of the
lower entry price; $0.87 for the MAR25C/FEB25C time spread, and
hope the stock finishes around $25 in four weeks. NRC was very
interesting as the option quotes opened near the previous closing
prices but soon moved apart in the spread (MAR50C/FEB50C) even
though the stock price remained quiet and the volume was fairly
docile. Our initial price was $1.12. CNTO, the butterfly spread,
moved lower most of the day reducing our initial entry to $0.87
for the FEB35C/40C/45C position. Remember, there is a method of
legging out of a butterfly spread that is acceptable. If the
stock price moves significantly, early in the life of the
spread, the BULL spread portion or the BEAR spread portion can
be closed-out near their maximum profit potentials. The spreader
may want to take advantage of this situation in order to profit
more if the stock reverses direction and comes back into the
profit range. By increasing his risk slightly, he may be able to
improve his position significantly by converting the butterfly
spread to a vertical spread. Although the chances of such a trend
reversal cannot be considered great, it does not cost the trader
much to restructure himself into a position with a much broader
maximum profit. That's our plan, we'll see what happens...

In other portfolio activities; PCS just keeps climbing like there
is no gravity and we just wonder where it will end. If any of you
are exercised early on the short side of the spread, let us know.
SRCM is a source of pain as the stock price has fallen sharply
without any change in the buying pressure. We decided to pull the
plug and prevent any losses. The JAN17P was closed at $1.25 and
we would expect to sell the JAN15P at a minimum of $0.50 for a
break-even exit. The initial target will be $1.00 until the stock
reverses (upward) again.

Tuesday, January 26

On Tuesday, U.S. stocks rallied in afternoon trading to close near
session highs. Solid earnings reports, stock splits, and big tech
deals all boosted the market. The DJIA closed unofficially up 115
points at 9318.40. The Nasdaq index of technology issues finished
up almost 65 points at 2433.46, surpassing a record high close of
2415.49 set on January 20th. Big gains in shares of IBM, Xerox,
Microsoft and Yahoo accounted for much of the positive movement.

On Tuesday, our big movers were AOL, CPQ, LVLT and SUNW. AOL was
the only issue we acted on, closing half of our debit position at
$2.25 for a $0.75 profit. On the LVLT debit spread, we expect to
close at about a $6.50 credit for a $2.00 profit. SRCM continued
downward but did not reach our target exit for the FEB15P. Watch
for signs of a turn-around as the buying pressure is still very
healthy on this stock. PCS just keeps climbing, about 6 days in a
row. MRK had a surprise rebound today, climbing $6 on a positive
earnings announcement. More to discuss on Thursday...

    - NEW PLAYS -

Today we will focus on some of the common stocks in the blue-chip
technology group. We rarely play these issues because the main
section of the newsletter covers these stocks in-depth and we like
to bring you a wide array of candidates. These companies are in
the news everyday and the earnings/split-mania is just too much to
pass up...Good Luck!
******************************************************************
MSFT - Microsoft  $171.56     *** Disparity? ***

Microsoft Corp. develops, manufactures, licenses and supports a
range of software products, including scalable operating systems,
server applications, business and productivity applications,
software development tools and Internet software and technologies.

Microsoft rules! With a market value that far outstrips its sales,
Microsoft is the world's #1 software company. Softwares include
Windows, Excel, MS Word, PowerPoint, and Encarta. The Microsoft
Network provides online content, and its Internet Explorer is
still battling Netscape Navigator for market share. With NBC, the
company operates cable news channel MSNBC. They also provide email
with "Hotmail" and many other services.

Everybody is making deals with MSFT. To make AltaVista a premier
destination site on the Web, Compaq announced a partnership with
Microsoft in which AltaVista will offer a e-mail service based on
Microsoft's Hotmail service. In addition, AltaVista and Microsoft
agreed to make AltaVista's Web search the primary search vehicle
for the Microsoft Network Internet site.

The big news (of course) was the blow-out earnings and the 2:1
stock-split. On Monday, Microsoft said its stock split would
increase its shares outstanding to 5 billion and make its stock
more affordable. The split will take effect on 3/12/98 if it is
approved by shareholders.

We expect MSFT will consolidate somewhat after the news wears off
but there is no doubt it will return to the headlines shortly
thereafter. Sell the time premium now before it evaporates in
this small disparity play.

PLAY (conservative):

BUY  PUT MAR-155 OI=686  A=$4.00
SELL PUT MAR-160 OI=3842 B=$5.38
NET CREDIT TARGET=$1.50 ROI=42% (2 months)

Chart = http://quote.yahoo.com/q?s=MSFT&d=3m
******************************************************************
DELL - Dell Computer  $88.50     *** Almost Free Money ***

Dell Computer is one of the world's top PC makers and the world's
#1 direct-sale computer vendor. The company sells hardware and
markets third-party software and peripherals. Products include
notebooks, PCs, and network servers. Dell also markets a variety
of peripherals and software for other manufacturers. More than 90%
of its systems are sold to businesses and government entities. The
company continues to expand services such as its Web site, which
is expected to process half of it's transactions by the year 2000.

Dell recently announced that they have secured a share of the #1
position in the worldwide personal workstation market. They also
continue as the number one vendor for customer satisfaction and
their scores are significantly higher than most competitors in
price/performance, overall reliability, repair and delivery time.

Dell will post earnings sometime in mid-February and we expect
the stock to make the traditional run to the actual announcement.
In addition to buying calls, you might elect to make this play
with current portfolio collateral. This is a low return spread
based on another small disparity but the worst that could happen
is you choose to own DELL at $69.19.

PLAY (very conservative):

BUY  PUT MAR-65 DLQ-OM OI=766  A=$1.19

******************************************************************
XRX - Xerox Corp.  $116.31     *** Split Play ***

Xerox engages in worldwide development, marketing, manufacturing,
financing and servicing of document processing products.

This week, Xerox delivered another record quarter, reflecting
strong double-digit earnings growth consistent with company
objectives, even though pre-currency revenue growth was clearly
affected by some weaker economies. Their fourth quarter diluted
earnings per share increased 16% to $1.69 and income increased
17% to $615 million, primarily as a result of outstanding growth
in digital product revenues, improved operating margins and
ongoing benefits from the worldwide restructuring program. Xerox
also announced an 11% increase in the quarterly cash dividend on
the company's common stock and a two-for-one stock split.

The stock split will be effective for shareholders of record on
2/4/99 and distributed on 2/23/98. The quarterly dividend will
increase 11% to 20 cents on a post-split basis, payable on 4/1/98
to shareholders of record on March 5. Today's gap-up and the
split date make perfect timing for a one month spread. Plan to
close the play near the February strike date on the pre-split run.

******************************************************************
IBM - Intl. Business Machines  $185.50     *** Split Play ***

International Business Machines is the world's top provider of
computer hardware and it is #2 in software. The company makes a
broad range of computers, including PCs, mainframes, and network
servers. The company also makes software and peripherals, and has
an ever-expanding service arm. IBM owns software pioneer Lotus
Development, maker of the Lotus Notes messaging system. Almost 60%
of the company's sales are to foreign customers and IBM continues
to revamp its image, with a focus on Internet business.

As expected, IBM declared a two-for-one stock split, just one day
after software rival Microsoft did the same. IBM posted fourth
quarter earnings last week that exceeded street expectations but
saw its shares fall after failing to announce a split. Today, the
stock rebounded on the renewed interest. The new shares should be
distributed on or about May 26 to shareholders of record on May 10.
The IBM board also set a regular quarterly dividend of $0.22 per
share, payable March 10 to stockholders of record on Feb. 10.

Although the current technical (and earnings) outlook is somewhat
lackluster, we believe Big-Blue will rise to the occasion and
easily hold $185 on the strike date in March.
