The Option Investor Newsletter - Trading Alert

Trading Alert 3:PM

We are concerned about the Asian markets tonight and how they
will react to Brazil. We feel you should consider closing open
positions before the end of the day in case Asia self destructs tonight.

The U.S. markets have recovered strongly but are still showing signs
of further weakness. Time to be careful until a new market trend is
established.

Good Luck

Jim
