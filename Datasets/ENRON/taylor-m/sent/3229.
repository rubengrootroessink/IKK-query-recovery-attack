Meetings have been held this week on bankruptcy reform with the CFTC and the
Treasury Department. FDIC also hosted a technical meeting this morning with
the FED, SEC, Treasury and CFTC.  Seth Grosshandler, Josh Cohn and Geoff
Goldman attended on behalf of the Bond Market Association and ISDA.

Various modifications have been made to our package as a result of these
meetings in an attempt to facilitate an amendment package the administration
will be able to support and send to the Capitol Hill for inclusion into the
overall bill.  These modifications are reflected in a revised Summary
Document page that will be faxed to you this morning.
