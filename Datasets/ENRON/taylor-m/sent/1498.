Wednesday morning is the only time I will be in the office all week and is 
already fully booked.  Will you be in San Antonia later?  Maybe we can meet 
then.

I will be in Houston Wednesday morning and would like to see if I could get 
on your schedules for 45 minutes to discuss current Argentina issues. I will 
ask my assistant Maria Jose Minguillion to contact each of you to see if this 
is convenient

Joe maybe we could have an early coffee of late evening discussion.


Thanks

MFG
