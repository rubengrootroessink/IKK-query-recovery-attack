I'll be out the 26th but in the 27th - the afternoon would probably be better 
for me since it will be my first day back after vacation.

Mark and Brent;

I will be in Houston on March 26 and 27 (returning to Brazil on the 28th).  
If you think it would be appropriate to discuss any of the EOL-Brazilissues, 
please let me know if you will be available in any of these days.

Rgds,

Sami
