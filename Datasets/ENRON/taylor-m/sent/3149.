Thanks for the update - the fax came in and was delivered to Jeff Hodge by 
mistake - I'll leave it at your desk.

Mark:

I called the State Bar of Texas to reconfirm the hours shown on your 
statement.  I was told you were in total compliance for 2000.  The Bar will 
be sending me an updated fax confirming that information.

Thanks!
Holly 

Have a good weekend and holiday!
