I wish it were more clear.  I am trying to get down there to talk to the 
commercial people about the business direction and support we can provide but 
until then I don't know that we should get their hopes up.  I had hoped to 
come this week but Randy is here in Houston.  Maybe second half of next 
week?  Do you know if everyone will be in those days? (I was thinking Sao 
Paolo Wed/Thurs and B.A. Thurs/Fri).

Here is my proposed response.  Let me know if you want to mention the last 
item or not.  Thanks.

Mike, I agree on having the trading attorneys continue to work on 
transactional work in Bolivia.  I also agree with Fede that to the extent a 
supply contract or off-take agreement is part of an overall financing 
agreement that the work ought to remain with the attorney in charge if 
overseeing the all the documentation for the project.  As always though we 
would be available to review provisions or answer any questions regarding 
Enron's position on trading issues.  Additionally, it may be possible that in 
the future a trading attorney in Brazil may be available to handle Bolivian 
issues as well.
Brent

I agree.  One little comment.  Though the transactional legal work should 
remain in Argentina, as an exemption, I would suggest to use Brazilian 
resources for "project financeable" gas supply agreements.

I like to convey my thoughts regarding Bolivia legal responsibilities in 
light of the recent adjustments in commercial responsibility for Bolivia gas 
supply. As of today we have moved all responsibility for Bolivian natural gas 
supply and projects into the wholesale group under Fede. We have also moved 
Gaby over to support the effort. 

In light of the need for my group to focus on making the Argentine commercial 
markets a success and the wholesale groups need to support the projects I 
would like to propose that all Bolivian project related legal work go to John 
Novak's group and  all transactional Bolivian legal work (sales and 
purchases) remain in Argentina. 

I believe this division of responsibilities leverages off everyone expertise 
and eliminates the bottle necks we are having in Argentina regarding the 
project work. It will also allow the Bolivian commercial people to be 
supported best with their respective local legal talent.

Please let me know your thoughts. 

MFG
