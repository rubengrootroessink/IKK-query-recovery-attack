Thank you very much - can I get a copy of the Risk article?  

The BIS numbers unfortunately do not distinguish which of the commodity 
numbers are applicable to energy, and worse yet they include only numbers 
from reporting banks.  In the energy area a large proportion of the 
transactions are by non-bank institutions -this makes finding the numbers 
much harder because companies like Enron are not required to publicly 
disclose their positions.  Hopefully the Risk article has some numbers but if 
you can find anything else specifically relating to the size of the energy 
derivatives markets that would be helpful.

Mark,

I found an article in Risk, April 1999 titled "Banking on energy derivatives: 
Brokers are acting more and more like investment banks, designing structured 
trades and bundled risk management solutions.  Nowhere is the trend more 
clear than in the energy markets."   Also,  the attached reports describe the 
OTC market.  Please let me know where to go from here.
