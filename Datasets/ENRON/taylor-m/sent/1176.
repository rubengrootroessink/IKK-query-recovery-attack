Does it make sense for us to set up a meeting with you participating from 
Buenos Aires?  I'm not sure we have much to tell them at this stage - 
actually, I'm sure I don't have anything new to report but if you do that 
would be fine with me.

Michael and myself are planing to be in Hoston on Thursday and Friday of this 
week. We intend to see as many people as possible regarding EOL 
implementation. We will meet Dave Forster and his team among others. We would 
like to fit a meeting with you as a group or individually. 
Please let me know about your availability and if it is possible to meet with 
more than one of you in one place.
Thank you
