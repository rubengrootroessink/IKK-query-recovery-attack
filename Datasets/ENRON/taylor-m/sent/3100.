Hi Debbie:

Thanks for your note - it's always nice to hear from MC friends!  

I'm living in Houston and working in the legal department of a large energy 
company (Enron).  I have two main areas of focus: derivatives trading (swaps, 
options, etc.) which I've been doing for over 6 years now and e-commerce 
which is relatively new.  The most fun work project I've had was being the 
lead lawyer in designing and launching our internet commodity trading 
platform about a year ago.  It has been tremendously successful.  While few 
people have ever heard of it, it is the largest (by dollar volume) website in 
the world!

I keep in touch with Mark Kopinski who is managing a couple of international 
mutual funds in New York.  My work takes me there several times a year and I 
usually try to see him if I have some free time.  The college is thinking 
about another capital campaign and he and I were on a preliminary planning 
committee (to see if a campaign makes sense).  Ralph V. was there - whom I 
hadn't seen in years! - and of course I keep in touch with Doc, too.  I was 
on campus for my 20th reunion a couple of years ago.  There were only 2 of us 
from '78 so it wasn't as much fun as I'd hoped but it was still good to see 
familiar faculty faces.  With luck the 25th will draw a bigger crowd.

My Midwest geography isn't what it once was but it sounds like you've got a 
terrible commute.  I hope you're liking your work to justify the drive.  I 
rarely make it back to Chicago but let's keep in touch and definitely let me 
know if you ever make it down this way.

Mark
