Mark:

 Attached is the standard job posting form that we've been using lately for 
your review and comments.  Please let me know if we need to add any specific 
requirements applicable to Jan's desk.  As indicated in the form, I've 
requested the posting to end on April 2, 1999.   We will post internally and 
externally (external posting is via the Internet).  

Thanks.
Nony
