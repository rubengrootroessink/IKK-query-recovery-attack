Hello Mark,

Justin Boyd told me that your can help me with questions regarding Chile.
We got a request for guest access through MG.
The company is called Escondida and is a subsidiary of BHP Australia.

Please advise if I can set up a guest account or not.
F.Y.I.: MG is planning to put a "in w/h Chile" contract for Copper on-line as 
soon as Enron has done the due diligence for this country.
Thanks !


Best regards
