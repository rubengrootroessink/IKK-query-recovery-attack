! In the absence of an applicable give-up agreement, new Rule 9.11A will=20
define the respective responsibilities/obligations to an order of executing=
=20
brokers, customers and Clearing Members.

! The term =01&executing broker=018 as used in Rule 9.11A refers to the reg=
istered=20
billing entity, Member Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is transmitte=
d.

! Rule 9.11 will provide that, in the absence of an applicable give-up=20
agreement, a Clearing Member may reject a trade only if: (1) the trade=20
