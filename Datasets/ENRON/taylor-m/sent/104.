We're looking forward to stopping by but it may be a little later - not sure 
about the exact schedule for the eve.  Mind if we bring a friend or two?  I 
doubt they'll come with us (they work til about 9 or 10 on Fridays and are 
usually ready to collapse at that point) but you never know til you ask.

We still have too much beer left and need your help in getting rid of
it.  You're invited to our house tomorrow, Friday, at 9:00 for drinks
and a pre-JR's get together.  Other beverages will be served if wanted.
 Sorry, Adobe will not deliver their tasty beverage.

Let me know if you and yours can attend.

Gordon
