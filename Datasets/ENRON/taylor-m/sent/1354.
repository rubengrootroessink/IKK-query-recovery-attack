		 Subject: Sales Practices/Anti-Manipulation Training 

Please be advised that Ken Raisler from Sullivan and Cromwell will be 
conducting  Sales Practices/Anti-Manipulation Training sessions this week for 
the commercial staff.   The program covers  the legal implications of various 
activities of our commercial team -- particularly as they interact with 
customers in marketing.  The program also covers laws prohibiting market 
manipulation that might affect our trading and marketing activities.

The two hour training sessions will be  held at the Doubletree, in the 
Dezavala Room on the second floor at the listed times.   Please feel free to 
attend and observe (since legal staff are more likely to know the answers, 
you are asked not to participate in the break-out small group sessions).

  Session 1 Thursday, Sept. 14  2:00 p.m.
 Session 2 Thursday, Sept. 14  4:00 p.m.
 Session 3 Friday, Sept. 15  9:00 a.m.
 Session 4 Friday, Sept. 15  2:00 p.m.

Please feel free to contact me at X57373  or Mark Taylor at X37459 if you 
have any questions.
