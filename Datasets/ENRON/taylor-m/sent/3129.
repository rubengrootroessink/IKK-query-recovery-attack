I would think adding the name would be adequate; do you agree?

Subject: Merger - El Paso Merchant Energy, L.P.

Pertaining to the email below--I spoke to El Paso this morning about the 
gty's (there are a total of 3 in question covering financial and physical 
deals w/ENA, HPL, and EPMI).  They agreed to have those three amended to 
include the name El Paso Merchant Energy, LP (as they only include Gas, LP).  
This is what their Legal is recommending in order to have the gty amendments 
executed ASAP and to make it as clean as possible (since 2 of the 3 gty's are 
tied to contracts).  Also, the amendments will be made effective as of 
12/31/00.

Let me know if you think we should ask for completely new gty's.

Veronica
