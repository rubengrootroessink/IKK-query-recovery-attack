success of the Policies and Procedures.

 Therefore, please register for one of the four one-hour sessions listed=20

particular group is the one highlighted in bold on the list below).  Howeve=

interactive nature of the training, it is important that you attend one of=
=20
the March 5 sessions if at all possible.
