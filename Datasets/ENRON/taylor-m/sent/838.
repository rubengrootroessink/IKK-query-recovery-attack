I finally got my film developed - this gives you an idea of how often I use 
the camera - and thought you might like these.  Unfortunately the only shot 
on the roll of Bruce didn't turn out - directly attributable to the 
photographer's lack of skill - and we never did have anybody take a group 
shot.  There were several others that you can tell would have been great 
shots if my thumb hadn't half obscured the lens.  The sunset was taken during 
our last night there while you guys were swimming off in the direction the 
picture was taken (if you listen carefully, you can almost hear Ted losing 
his lunch down below).

Hope you guys are well - any trips to Houston on the agenda?

Mark
