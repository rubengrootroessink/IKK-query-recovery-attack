Per my conversation with Trisha Hughes the following is the proper coding for 
the Enron OnLine Project (EOL).

Company: 460
RC:  1491
W.O.:  E14911

Please use the rest of the proper coding all all other categories such as 
detail class, etc.

If you have any questions, please contact Trisha Hughes or myself.

Thanks,
Mary

The original W.O. # assigned E14911 on Co. 460 is the correct work order to 
use.   Please let me know if you have any questions.

Please use your normal coding for account major, account sub, detail class.

Please add OEXP in the cost catalog description:  OEXP covers all expenses 
except for payroll including meals, travel, and hotel (for your expense 
reports).

This work order is being set up in the ATES payroll system.  It will be 
available for this pay period.

I hope this change has not inconvenienced anyone.

Regards,

Dave
