Tana has pointed out that Net Works does not have a policy (at least not one 
we have heard of) regarding the handling of original contract documentation 
after it is executed.  There is not an Enron-wide policy but instead a 
patch-work of policies created by the operating units.  Tana and I would be 
happy to discuss this with you - or whoever you want to designate - and make 
suggestions if you don't already have a plan in mind.
