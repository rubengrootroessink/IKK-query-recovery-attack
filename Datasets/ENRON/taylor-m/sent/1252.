I had a lengthy conference call with a bunch of Milbank lawyers this 
afternoon to educate them on the EnronOnline structure.  I received the 
attached message this evening - just fyi.

Mark: It was great to "meet" you this afternoon -- as a tech lawyer, I have 
been following? Enron's impressive on-line activities and nimble evolution as 
a true new economy company? . . . I? thought I? would mention that our 
Technology Group has worked on, and is currently involved in, a number of 
b-to-b exchanges, on behalf of both investors and technology providers 
(including the petroleum, chemicals and logistics industries). We have been 
actively involved in structuring, formation and financing issues in 
particular and have advised on technology, corporate, tax, employee benefit 
and IP issues as well. Please let me know if, as the ETE evolves, we can be 
of any assistance to you. You can reach me via e-mail or by phone at 
212-530-5720.

Regards,

Dan Mummery
