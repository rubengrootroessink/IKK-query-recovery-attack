An extra $200 is just a drop in this bucket.   St. Regis sounds good to me.

I am happy to stay at the St Regis at this price but I am also happy to get a 
cheap room near the airport.  The price has gone up quite a bit since the 
last time I stayed there.

Mark ? the cost of the room at St. Regis (Thursday, 5/17/01) for one night is 
$286.14 (14.5% tax).  I have booked two separate rooms under Linda's name.   
Let me know if there is anything else I can do.

?--Andrea
