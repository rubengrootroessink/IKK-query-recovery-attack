Dear Sir,

I am Mr. William (Bill) Eke, Bank Manager of Orient Bank of Nigeria, Lagos
Branch.  I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.

On June 6, 1997, an American Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian
National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed)
Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$75,000,000.00 (Seventy Five
Million Dollars) in my branch.  On maturity, I sent a routine notification
to
his forwarding address but got no reply.  After a month, we sent a reminder
and
finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National
Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident.
On
further investigation, I found out that he died without making a Will, and
all
attempts by the American Embassy to trace his next of kin was fruitless.

I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly
did
not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including
his
Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.  This sum of total US$75,000,000.00 is
still
sitting in my Bank as dormant account.  No one will ever come forward to
claim
it, and according to Nigerian Law after 5 years, the money will revert to
the
ownership of the Nigeria Government if the account owner is certified dead
and
nobody comes forward to claim it.

This is the situation, and my proposal is that I am looking for an American
who
will stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Barry Kelly.  A bank account abroad
will
then facilitate the transfer of this money to the beneficiary/next of kin.
This
is simple all you have to do is to immediately send me the details of a bank
account anywhere in the world for me to arrange the proper money transfer
paperwork.  The money will then be paid into this account for us to share in
the
ratio 70% for me; 30% for you.

There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be
done
by me using my position and connection in the Banks in Nigeria.  We shall
employ
the services of an attorney to draft the Will and obtain all necessary
documents
and letters of administration in your favour for the transfer.  This
transaction
is guaranteed.

If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email
address
below.  Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this
transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require
your
assistance to invest my share in your country.

Awaiting your urgent reply via my email: billeke0@lycos.com


Thank you and regards.

Mr. William (Bill) Eke.
