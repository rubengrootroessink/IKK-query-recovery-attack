I just finished speaking with Danny Sullivan.  He understands that I have not 
reviewed these transactions; that's fine.  He's not certain when these are 
closing but probably after X-mas.  Please don't feel bound by this 
documentation because it's a "continuation" of the former BTI transaction.  
Even Sarlux/Trakya have some modifications.  Thanks.  SS

Please find attached redrafts of the swap confirm and swap schedule,
with changes marked from the last drafts.

Please note that Enron's obligations to pay principal under the swap
should terminate in the event of a transfer to a third party under section
5.05 of the sale and option agreement before the expiry of the option
period. This is because the third party will not be obliged to swap the
proceeds of sale it receives from PR-C in the event that the option is
exercised. See section 3.3 of the schedule.

Also, the definition of Payments Received may need to be changed once
the flow of funds in the indenture and trust agreement have been
finalized.

Please call me on 214 659 4403 if you have any questions.
