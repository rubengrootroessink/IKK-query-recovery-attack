I'm almost certain you continue to receive these without my forwarding them 
to you.  They show up to me as a bcc:, however I believe they also get to you 
under "mtaylor@ect.enron.com".  I don't know why it would come to me as a 
bcc.  It must have something to do with your ect address.

Attached please find a copy of the Offering Memorandum for Project Tornado, 
marked to show changes from the previously distributed version.  I have also 
included a clean copy for your convenience.

This is an interim draft, but in the interest of keeping to the timetable we 
wanted to distribute it tonight.

Please fax any comments to (212) 451-7679.

If you have any questions please call me at (212) 735-3152.
