Subject: Reference to telephone conversations on confirmations

I reviewed the ECT confirmation templates today and found that a reference is 
made to a telephone conversation on most of the templates for transactions 
under a ECT Master Agreement. 

The offending sentence is as follows:

"This is a confirmation of the following Transaction entered into with you 
pursuant to a telephone conversation on <<DealDate>> between the parties:"

I would like to change it to read as follows, with your approval:

"This is a confirmation of the following Transaction entered into between us 
on  <<DealDate>>:"


This change will allow the current templates to handle both telephone and 
internet trading.

Please advise.
