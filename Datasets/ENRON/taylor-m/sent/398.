Sorry about all these - it looks like people who don't know my address are 
just guessing and they get you instead.  I'd appreciate it if you could 
forward them on to me when they come to you - I'll let the sendersknow the 
correct address as I get them and hopefully that should cut down the number 
going forward.

Mark

Do I need to continue to forward these to you, or are you already receiving 
them?
