Yes, I think we were ok with the base language - it was just those last 
issues we were waiting on.

Melba, I am waiting to confirm one outstanding issue before signing off on 
the EOL product for Canadian financial power.  I expect to have that issue 
resolved in the next day or so and then would be in a position to sign off 
from a legal perspective.  I will send you an e-mail as soon as the issue is 
resolved.  Mark, I think that, other than the particular market issues that 
arose at the end of the year, you and I had otherwise agreed on the language 
and were ready to go.  Am I right?

Cheers

Greg Johnston
