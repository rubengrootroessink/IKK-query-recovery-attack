Subject: Credit Derivatives Reference Entities

Here is the list of reference entities I received from Debbie with the 
confidentiality agreements and the reference entities they relate to 
indicated.  If the reference entity name is in bold we have a confidentiality 
agreement with the entity itself. I notice that AOL, Nortel and Qwest are not 
on the list (they were on the original list for actual trading sent to me) - 
were they removed by you guys?
