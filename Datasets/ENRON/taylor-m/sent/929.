Just between you and me, I'm astonished -- delighted but astonished, that 
they fugured their way through all of those Japanese holidays and the 
aftermath.

I'm told that the advice from Japanese counsel was recieved yesterday but I 
haven't read it yet.  I don't anitcipate any problems.  I can't tell from 
these e-mails if they are talikng about sending out initial packets on May 11 
or going live for Japanese counterparties then (all of whom must then have 
already executed PAs and been approved).

Mine is on 11 May.  Sounds like a good excuse for a party.

I am getting in touch with Thomas/Chismar in Singapore to ensure they are 
prepared.  Also our list of potential contacts is being refined and would 
hope to have it relatively complete by early next week.  Our local PR firm 
has suggested that we translate the basic EOL brochure into Japanese.  We are 
moving forward with this.  I do not expect to require any further 
localization at this point.  Our local attornies are getting back before the 
end of the week with final comments on the plan, contracts, etc.

Louise,

Given the comments below, could we move the roll out to 10-12 May?

Joe,

In talking with Nick yesterday evening, I learned that most people are off in 
Japan during the week of May 1.  April 29 and May 3 through 5 are all 
national holidays (Greenery Day, Constitution Day, National Holiday and 
Children's Day respectively).  Furthermore, Nick advises that many people 
start the holiday week early and stretch it into the following week.  This 
makes our selection of May 1 week for EOL a most unsatisfactory choice.   I 
would recommend that we shoot for May 10 or 11 (which would conflict with 
possible high profile participation in an APEC meeting, which I'll be 
managing) or preferably the week of May 15.  We could introduce EOL earlier, 
but publicity would be reduced given Rebecca's schedule for interviews and 
lead time for printing/mailing promotional packets.  It would be very tight, 
but we could do it the week of April 24.  Rebecca could provide overview 
interviews, supplemented by an EOL demonstration and your explanation of how 
this provides a platform to build our business.  Do you have 
preferences/limitations from a business activity perspective?  Unless you 
object, on Monday I'll get recommendations from our PR firm and also check 
Louise's availability/desire to be part of the EOL introduction.

John
