I know you are getting the legal bills paid through Don's budget for work 
done in Argentina.  Is it possible to handle the bills for work done in 
Brazil the same way?  I have a bill from Tozzini that we need to pay.  Since 
it is all in connection with South American trading it seems reasonable to 
treat it the same as the others but I'm not sure how you are handling these 
things.  Any thoughts?
