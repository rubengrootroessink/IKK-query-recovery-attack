Hey Jeff:

I just saw your email address on the Monmouth web site.  I didn't realized 
you were at Mayer Brown.  I don't even know if we've talked since I left New 
York (almost 5 years ago).  I'm now in the legal department at Enron Capital 
& Trade Resources in Houston where my group is responsible for the legal 
issues in derivatives trading here.  I don't get to Chicago often but if they 
ever send you down this way, be sure to look me up!

C., F. & S.,

Mark
