Thanks for your note - I'll keep those items in mind.  It seems pretty clear 
to me that the Pres. has something of a bricks and mortar agenda and some 
gentle nudges towards a more academic path may be needed.   I asked Mark 
Kopinski, who is also coming to the planning meeting, if he wanted to join us 
for dinner so I've sent him a note asking if he wants to go to the play or 
not - I'll let you know what he says - I have mixed feelings since I'd like 
to see the play but would regret the time we could have spent chatting.
