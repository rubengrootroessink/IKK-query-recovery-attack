Here are the most recent versions from Clifford Chance.  They were sent to 
Sullivan & Cromwell yesterday to be "Americanized" and are still drafts with 
a number of open issues yet to be resolved - so we can easily make changes as 
necessary to solve issues you may raise.

The PA = Password Application - to be signed by counterparty & sent to us 
before a password is issued.
The ETA = Electronic Trading Agreement - to be agreed to online before 
trading is permitted.
The ROETA = Read Only ETA - to be agreed to online by persons wishing access 
to the site to view but not trade (probably misnamed - should be ROPA or 
something that doesn't sound like they'll be able to trade).

Dear Louise

Thank you for your e-mail to Tim.  Please find attached revised versions of
the PA, ETA and ROETA taking into account Scott Sefton's comments and our
recent telephone discussions.  Please note that I have not referred to the
NBP side letters as I have agreed with Edmund Cooper that this will be dealt
with in the long form descriptions.

These documents are identical to the documents I sent to Edmund yesterday
save for a minor change to the limitation of liability clause.

I look forward to receiving your comments as soon as possible so that I can
prepare country specific versions.

Kind regards

Andrew Wilkinson
