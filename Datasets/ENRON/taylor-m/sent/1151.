Let's stick with what we already have on order.  Is Frank ready to start 
Phase III as soon as Phase II is done?

Joya,
Here's a break down of the Wooden Private Office "E" station (Cherry Wood) 
vs. the Laminate Private Office "E" station (Off white laminate). All quotes 
are approximate and based on reusing our existing inventory, if available. 
Lead-time for both is approximately 3-5 weeks based on quantities.

Wooden Private Office "E" Station = $2100. each

Laminate Private Office "E" Station = $750. each

Feel free to call me if there are questions.

Thanks,
Reggie
