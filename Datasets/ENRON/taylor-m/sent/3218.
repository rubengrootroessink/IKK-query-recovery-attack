Mark,
Please find attached our first revision of the EnronOnline Service Agreement 
Draft. As you may notice on your calendar, we asked Holly to schedule a 
conference call with Sullivan & Crom well for today @11:00 to go over our 
comments and their questions. Please, if you consider convenient, forward 
them this document so they have it before the conference call and we can go 
directly to our comments.
Some of the additional issues we want to talk to them/ you are:
We are not licensing the Stack Manager, we are just giving them access to it, 
therefore there is no "Software License"
Prohibit Pipeline's usage of EnonOnline name without our written approval
Default & Remedies
Definitions to be added
Invoicing & Terms of payment
Marketing Brochures & materials
Define Schedule B & C (Support Services & Termination payments), and
Timeline

We really appreciate your help in pushing this, as you know we need to have 
this document finalised by no latter than Tuesday morning, since Dave is 
meeting with NGPL on Wednesday,
Thanks
Carlos
