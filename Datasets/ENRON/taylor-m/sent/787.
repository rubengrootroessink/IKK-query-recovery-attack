There are about 15 - 20 pages you would probably want to see.  If that's not 
too many for you to receive I don't mind faxing it.  You can always call me 
from the office with the fax number when you're ready - I can even leave it 
with my assistant when I'm away from my desk in case you get her instead of 
me.

It's finally winter here, too.  Of course that's nothing compared to you guys 
- it might get down into the 30's at night and 40's in the daytime.  It's 
only really bad when it's that cold and it rains.  Brrrr.  It was probably 
pretty smart of Delta to send those planes to Cincinnati since as a hub they 
could probably get them on connecting flights to wherever they were 
originally headed more easily from there than anywhere else (of course a lot 
were probably headed to NYC and the flights there the next day must have been 
packed!).

Aside from a quick one-day trip to New York I haven't had to do any traveling 
lately - I'll probably be going to Portland in early March and Amsterdam 
mid-March.  I may try and get to South America sometime in February but 
nothing is scheduled yet.

Love, Mark
