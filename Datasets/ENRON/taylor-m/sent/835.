Subject: Sample GTC's

Mark,

Further to our conversation the other day, are you happy for us to change the 
following in the GTC screen in EnronOnline:

Old:  "(Guest Users will view Generic GTCs which are shown for information 
purposes only)"

New: "(Guest Users will view sample GTC's which may differ in some respects 
from execution versions)"

Dave
