Mark:
Enclosed is a form of services agreement taht EES has entered into that may 
be a good starting point for us in connection with the derivative services 
agreement that we may want to enter into with entities like WCP.

Carol, I apologize for the delay in getting this to you.  Attached is a form 
that V&E just put together for us.  I think the format will be good for your 
purposes.  Let me know if you need anything else.

Regarding World Color Press, I will give you a call.  I spoke to Michelle 
Maynard, the lawyer on the transaction.  I need to check on a couple of other 
things before we talk.

Thanks, Kim
