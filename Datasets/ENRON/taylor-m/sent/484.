Subject: PULP & PAPER LUNCHEON MEETING

The above-referenced meeting is still scheduled for Friday, October 1, 1999, 
but the time has changed.  In order for the people in London to participate, 
we have moved the start time to 11:00 a.m., and the meeting will be held in 
EB30C1.  Lunch will be served.

Please let me know via email if you will attend, so we'll have an accurate 
headcount.
