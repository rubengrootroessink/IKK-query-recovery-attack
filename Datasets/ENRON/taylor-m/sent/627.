You have to be careful reading those reports - the 145mph number is the 
current maximum wind speed - right at the eye wall - which is well to the 
south-east of St. Thomas.  The Weather channel this morning showed local 
radar indicating a lot of rain in the US 7 BVI but the storm center was 
pretty far away.  The real question is what direction will it go from here.  
If it heads out to the north east as predicted, no problems.  If it takes a 
turn to the north, direct hit.  I hadn't hard about the state of emergency 
but that could be due to rain related damage.

Many storm sites available:

In case you need it to decipher some of the coordinates, the BVI is at 
roughly 18 25' N 64 40' W
St. Thomas is closer to 18 20' N 65 W
