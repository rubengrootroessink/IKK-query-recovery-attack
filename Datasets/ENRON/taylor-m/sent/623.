It does make sense that there shouldn't be a problem with traveling to the 
USVI; since you have to clear immigration to get in there from the BVI I 
wouldn't expect to have to clear again when you go back to the mainland or 
Puerto Rico.  We haven't spent much time sailing in the USVI so it would be 
an exploratory trip for us - not at all a bad thing.  We can't get the boat 
to the USVI till Monday (charter doesn't start till noon on Sun. and there's 
tons of work getting all the food/drinks/ice etc. put away).  Best bet is to 
pick Bruce up in St. John - Charlotte Amalie on St. Thomas is reputed to be a 
large, busy commercial port - a great place for yachts to play dodge-em with 
the cruise ships (not fun).  There is regular ferry service from St. Thomas 
to St. John.  We won't be there before noon on Monday.

I just got off the phone with Greg so hopefully AA can do the right thing 
here!

OK...guys the story is this:


I have just spent the entire day at Federal Plaza with the INS in extremely
nasty conditions.  Basically, I was not able to get hold of a travel permit.
Vermont apparently has lost my documents including travel permit and Federal
Plaza cannot step in.  I cannot drive to Vermont, because they only do
postal.  I think I would feel slightly better had I known the outcome at the
start of the day rather than at the end.

Anyway, to cut a long story short, I asked the question of whether I could
goto the US Virgin Islands.  The first answer was "no", so I persisted and
the second answer was "yes; can I point you to the US in the US Virgin
Islands", so feeling very patronised but having achieved something for my
day at Federal Plaza I left.

We now have 3 choices:

1.    Go to US VI......I definitely cannot go to BVI
2.    Delay flight a couple of days and hope that travel permit comes
through (which it should because my lawyer)
3.    Got to USVI and get permit sent on if it comes through

G:  Please can you see about changing my flights to the US VI.  You are
better at dealing with airlines than I am.....pretty please!
