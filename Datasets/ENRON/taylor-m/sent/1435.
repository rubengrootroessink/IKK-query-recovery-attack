Subject: New Product Type - Approval Requested

Please offer your apprval to the following Product Type:

US Pipeline Capacity  NNG (Firm) 

The related Products are capacity products being offered by Nothern Natural 
Gas Company. As there are regulatory issues concerning the viewing of 
proprietary information by the market affiliates of NNG, chinese walls are in 
place through the operation of policy.

You may notice that there is no Sigma Factor associated with this Product. 
The SF has purposely been set to zero, as the Credit area of NNG will be 
responsible for the daily review of exposure to their Counterparties, and 
will coordinate any Credit issues with the Credit area of ENA.

Attached please find an example of a related Product Type.

I need to ask that you expedite this approval. In order to have the Product 
Type available for this coming Monday I must have the full approval by no 
later than this Wednesday (tomorrow) at Noon.

If you have any question, please feel free to call.
