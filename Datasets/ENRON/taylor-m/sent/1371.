Mark, how are you? Thanks again for taking the time to meet with us last 
week. While I am preparing information to send to you I thought you might 
like to know that yesterday I played golf with Bernie Purta of the NYMEX. He 
indicated to me that he is still a loyal employee of the NYMEX.

If you have any questions please let me know. 

regards,
