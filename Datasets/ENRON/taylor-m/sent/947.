Jay -

Thanks for your note.  This definitely falls into the "(b)" category.  The 
problem is that there are sooooo many things in the b pile already that I 
can't tell you exactly when this will be resolved.  

Having said that, I agree that the weather information is probably the least 
risky, but it might be helpful if you were to visit their sites and see if 
there is any comment about further use of the information posted there.  As 
for the others, a little additional information would be helpful.  For 
instance, I know we were in discussions with NGTL at one time and were 
unwilling to sign the letter they asked for.  Was there ever any follow-up 
with them on that?  Is there any correspondence at all (it doesn't have to 
look like an official contract).  Is the Telerate information also available 
from other sources?  Is it possible that Telerate gets it out really fast and 
that is their advantage but others are right behind with the same or very 
similar information?  Do we have an agreement of any kind with Telerate 
regarding the services they provide to us?

Thanks for your help and continuing attention to this - I agree we should be 
trying to do this the "right" way.

Mark

Dear Mark (back from South America?)

I received this email from Donna Greif.  It explains the sources for her data 
which she puts on EnronOnline every day.  As best I know, Mark, we don't have 
any agreement with any of these people for content that we place online.

I'm not too concerned about the weather (it's from the Canadian and American 
governments) but I am concerned about the NGTL data and the data we get from 
Telerate.

We have a disclaimer Online for the NGTL data, saying that it's our 
reproduction and not a representation of what they have on their own site 
(their own site which can be accessed through a password only!), but I think 
this proves, rather than refutes, the fact that we're redistributing their 
data without a right to do so.  The same applies for Telerate--we don't even 
give them recognition--we just post their numbers on our site.

I know you're a busy man, and I'm sure you're dealing with things like 
lawsuits against Enron by South American governments, or something like that, 
but this issue should (a) be dropped, because you believe that it's really 
not that important or (b) resolved, becuase you think it is.

Please tell me how I can help, or if we should let this issue drop.  If I 
don't hear from you, I'll assume that you don't think it's an important issue.

Thanks

Jay

Subject: Re: EnronOnline Newsticker  

Jay,

In your original email (attached below), you requested my source of US Nat 
Gas Stats that are posted as a newsticker item on the website.   Please note, 
I would have been more than happy to provide you with source details on the 
Canadian Weather Forecasts and NGTL Pipeline Data if it was part of your 
original request.

US Natural Gas Statistics (Gas in Storage & Cumulative Heating Degree Days)
 * My source is the Producer Newsletter distributed by the Mid-Marketing 
Department (Ross Prevatt & Dan Diamond
    are both part of that team).  For your convenience, I've attached a copy 
for your records
 * The Producer Newsletter is distributed on a weekly basis (Monday nights or 
Tuesday morning)
     and is faxed.  
        - the Mid-Marketing Department gets those numbers from several 
different sources.
        - I called Ross again today to re-verify.  He confirmed the following 
for me:
  * Gas Storage data comes from a direct feed from Telerate.
  * Lucy Oritz passes on the cumulative heating degree days to Ross.
       > Her source is National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration
       > web address = http://www.crh.noaa.gov/grr/wfolocat.htm
     - Should you require any additional details and need to make contact 
with Ross again.....
       I did take the liberty of explaining who you are, the group you 
represent as well as
       why you were needing this information.  I am sure he will be fully 
receptive and understand
       the nature of your question should you need to contact him again.  

Canadian Weather Forecasts (4 day forecast for 5 cities)
NGTL Pipeline Data (Prior day deliveries, etc.)
 * Candace Spencer & Terri Brian in Enron Canada's office pull this 
information from two different sources.  
 * They pull this information together, and fax updates us each morning.
     - NGTL Pipeline Data is pulled from 
http://www.nrgexpressway.com/ngtl/index.htm
  * You must have a password to gain access to this information.
     - Canadian Weather Forecast data is pulled from 
http://weather.ec.gc.ca/alberta_e.shtml
  * Upon reaching the site, you would select the appropriate City.
  * Once in the city, scroll down to get the weather forecast data.

My apologies for any mis-communications on your original request.  Feel free 
to call me if you are in need of more 
details (x3-9517).

Thanks,

dg


P.S.  Currently, Noel Petterson is updating the website.  His back-up is Matt 
Motsinger.   In additions (just an FYI), this
will be my last week with the EnronOnline team.   Please forward any future 
requests to Frank Davis.

Following our exchange of emails two weeks ago, I spoke with Ross (whom you 
suggested), but he didn't know of you & didn't think that anything he 
produced was sent to you.  He suggested that I contact Dan Diamond, who wrote 
back saying that he didn't know anything either but that I should contact 
Rahil Jafry.  The only problem of course is that I work with Rahil, and I'm 
trying to find this information in response to a discussion that I had with 
him!

So, could you tell me exactly where you get your information from, for the 
following items:

Canadian Weather Forecasts (4 day forecast for 5 cities)
NGTL Pipeline Data (Prior day deliveries, etc.)
US Natural Gas Stastics (Gas in Storage & Cumulative Heating Degree Days)

Even if you don't know the specific source, if you could tell me how you get 
the information, then I'll try to follow it up.  So, for example, 'Each day 
at 6am I receive a fax from 713.853.2297 with a list of numbers.  I take 
these numbers and put them in the Canadian ...'

Sorry to keep bothering you, but this is a potentially serious issue for 
us--we need to know exactly where we're getting our content from, and no one 
seems to know!  So anything that you can do to help would be appreciated 
greatly.

Thanks in advance

Jay

The EnronOnline team gets those numbers from the weekly Newsletter 
distributed the ENA Commercial Team.   Ross Prevatt is the individual who
actually puts the information together.

In talking with Ross this morning, that information is taken from a Telerate 
feed  (the Telerate feeder gets the info from daily/weekly/monthly 
publications).  Ross did not give me the specific companies that publish the 
information.  Feel free to call Ross directly if you need additional 
information.

Thanks,

dg

Dear Donna

(Following the voicemail that I left for you on Friday)  I was wondering if 
you could tell me whether or not the US Gas Storage data & the cumulative 
CDD/HDD data are taken from inside Enron only?  (I'm asking because Paul 
Goddard has encouraged me to update our letters of consent for content that 
we carry on the website.)

Many thanks,

Jay
