Aquila and others continue to transact under the wrong company (ie physical 
under the financial company and financial under the physical company).  I 
have had several conversations with them concerning this however, they have 
requested that we provide som sort of legal framework which will allow them 
to transact under one ID for seperate companies.  Mark has discussed this 
with outside counsel and are comfortable with such an arrangement.  
Essentially the document would state that physical transactions done under ID 
XXXXXXX will be with Aquila Energy Marketing and financial transactions done 
under ID XXXXXXXX will be with Aquila Risk Management.  

Please let me know if we can proceed with this type of document.  The only 
other alternatives at this point are to 1.) assign transacations as they are 
completed 2.) remove execute rights according to the company.
