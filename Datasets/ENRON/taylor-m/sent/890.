I have explained to Bryan that the legal due-diligence effort for reference 
entities for trading on EnronOnline will be a lengthier process than that 
which we were able to accomplish before the launch of the EnronCredit.com 
page.  That process is now underway.  Going forward, I would hope that we 
will have more lead time and be able to complete the process for both sites 
before a reference entity is used.

It is my understanding that the EnronOnline approval process is separate and 
approval for EnronCredit.com does not automatically mean approval for 
EnronOnline.

Debbie/Mark: Can you confirm or refute my understanding?

Thanks,

Dave
