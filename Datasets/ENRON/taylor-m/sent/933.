David:

Tana and I would like to talk with you to set up the counterparty approval 
process for EnronOnline regarding Australian counterparties (trading 
Australian and other products) and Australian products being traded by 
non-Australian counterparties.  The EnronOnline people are anxious that Tana 
be designated their liaison and we need to figure out what she can do and 
what you (or someone else in Australia) need to do as part of this process 
going forward.  Any chance you might be available for a telephone 
conversation about this at 9:00 am your time (5:00 pm Houston time) today?

Mark
