I tend to agree with you, but Nora Dobin is the lawyer who knows the most 
about the DealBench system - you should probably check with her.

Certain of my commercial folks have asked if they are able to access 
Dealbench which requires a point and click acceptance of the site access 
agreement.  As dealbench is an Enron site I think it is okay for us to agree 
and access the site; however, I wanted to know if you know of anything 
unusual about the site or access thereto.
