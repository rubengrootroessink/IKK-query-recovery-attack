Don't worry about the delay - if you want to wait til later next week that's 
fine by me.

Subject: Performance Feedback

Mark,

I just wanted to drop you a quick note on the feedback process. I declined 
Carol's feedback form, but that in no way is intended as a reflection on her 
performance.  I just have not worked with her enough yet to feel that I can 
contribute meaningful feedback. The few issues that I have worked with her on 
have given me a very favorable impression of her abilities. I certainly 
expect  to work more with her in the future.  Also, I will get Sara's and 
Susan Flynn's done, just not today. I will be in the office tomorrow, and 
should complete them then. I received a dozen feedback requests this period, 
and it is just taking me awhile to get them all done. I would prefer they be 
a day late, but meaningful. Sorry for the delay.

Thanks,
Tanya
