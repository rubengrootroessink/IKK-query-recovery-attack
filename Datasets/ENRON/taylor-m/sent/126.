COVERED CALL SECTION FOR JANUARY 24, 1999
******************************************************************
The Lesson Begins..

This week, we are going to begin a new educational series on basic
covered-call techniques. The first step is to explain our current
approach and the appropriate method for using this much maligned
strategy.

The objective of covered writing for most investors is increased
income though stock ownership. By definition, the ideal covered
call offers reduced risk and a good probability of making a profit.
In fact, our primary goal is to provide the subscriber with plays
that produce acceptable returns while still receiving an above
average amount of protection.

A mathematical basis...

The main factor that we focus on is called "return unchanged".
This is the return on investment that one would achieve if the
stock price were unchanged at option expiration. One can compare
potential plays more accurately using this approach since no
assumption is made about stock price movement. This method ignores
the relative price of the sold strike (ITM - OTM) and focuses
completely on the overall position.

A very simple concept...

With this conservative option writing strategy in mind, we look
for plays that return a minimum of 3%-5% per month and retain
downside protection of at least 10% (of the current stock price).
The overall position that is constructed using these guidelines
will be a relatively low risk play (regardless of the volatility
of the underlying stock) since the levels of protection will be
large and there is still the expectation of a reasonable return.

Other things to consider...

The amount of downside protection and the return on investment are
both very important considerations in determining which play to
choose but the technical and fundamental outlook of the underlying
stock must also be favorable.

The reason for ITM plays...

A minimally acceptable return is somewhat a matter of personal
preference but with the current market volatility, it would appear
that the advantages of the in-the-money position, (more consistent
profits and reduced risk) is more attractive to the majority of
our investors.

Next week, we'll discuss more covered-call strategies. Good Luck!

    - LOSING PLAYS -
    ****************
We suggest you consider closing the MWY position. Last week, the
stock price fell below technical support after the company said
its revenues and earnings in the second half of its fiscal year
will be below last year's results. The company was downgraded by
Hambrecht & Quist and Piper Jaffray to a "hold".

INFM - Infinium Software, Inc.  $6.13  *** Computer software ***

INFM develops/markets/supports business software applications for
the financial, human resource, and materials management functions
of organizations. Reported earnings Jan 21 and the current post-
earnings drop may offer an excellent buying opportunity.  EPS was
flat but revenues increased over 20% for the 8th straight quarter.
Our cost basis is below support and buying pressure has increased
over the last three trading days.

INVX - Innovex Inc.  $18.38  *** Dividends! ***

INVX develops and manufactures lead wire assemblies for computer
disk drives. They also design/manufacture flexible circuits and
chemically machined electrical components for the medical/computer
and communications industry. Price of stock spiked after company
settled (undisclosed) with ex-director. Friday, INVX declared an
increase in its regular quarterly dividend to $.04 per share,
payable 2/24/99, to SOR as of 2/10. Stock has strong support at
the cost basis. Buying pressure is off the scale and short term
technicals recently exhibited a "buy" signal.

Read-Rite Corporation designs, manufactures, and markets magnetic
recording heads for rigid disk drives. The tape always tells the
tale:  RDRT posted $0.02 profit (analyst predicted $0.17 loss) on
Wed. The key will be if the cost cutting and increased production
will work next quarter as current revenues did fall. Technically,
a very bullish chart with resistance around $25.

RNWK provides branded software products and services enabling the
delivery of streaming media content over the Internet. Caution:
earnings due Jan 27. Recently upgraded/coverage initiated, as
RNWK announced alliances with AtHome and Enron Network.

Question: At what price would you mind owning RNWK? We think
$42.25 isn't that bad, right there at support, and just before
earnings (post earnings dip?). If we don't get it, a 6.5% ROI for
trying seems like just compensation.

SCIO is engaged in the discovery, development, manufacture and
commercialization of novel human therapeutics, primarily
focused on cardiorenal disorders and Alzheimer's disease.
Lilly and SCIO agreed to continue their alliance on Alzheimer
research. Excellent cost basis with room to climb as resistance
is around $12.50. Buying pressure increasing with volume surge
bodes well for continued upward momentum.

SPNSF develops, markets and supports enterprise-wide solutions
for the rapid development of scaleable mission-critical software
applications. See last weeks write up. Here it is again, same

development of its lead angiogenesis inhibitor, SU5416, moving
directly from Phase I and Phase I/II studies into Phase III
colorectal and lung studies, and a Phase II/III study in
AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma. Some signs of increased buying

NAKED PUT SECTION FOR JANUARY 24, 1999
******************************************************************
Recently, we have had many questions about the margin requirements
for various option strategies. These new-subscriber requests also
contain questions about the necessary trading levels, margin, ROI
and collateral calculations for naked puts. We will try to cover
those subjects in the next few weeks. We start with definitions:

Writing a naked put...

A put writer assumes the obligation to buy the underlying security
at a specific price for a premium. There are two reasons for this
commitment; an investor unwilling to purchase stock at the current
price might write put options, hoping to take a position, (acquire
the stock) at a lower price. Another successful outcome is to just
receive the "premium" income if the stock remains above the sold
strike price. If the stock price finishes below the sold strike,
the seller (or writer) of the put option is obligated to purchase
the underlying stock (100 shares/contract) at the exercise price.
When this occurs, the cost of the stock (or the break-even) will
be the exercise price less the premium. When the sold strike price
goes "in-the-money", an investor must be ready to buy the stock at
any time because option contracts can be exercised early. The put
seller may also close the position by simply "buying-back" the
sold (short) put option.

The cost basis is simply the strike price minus premium received.
We list the cost basis of each play reference "owning the stock";
if it is PUT to you...

The collateral (or equity) required to sell a naked put varies for
different brokers. One of the most common formulas used by online
brokerages (Etrade for example) is:

The greater of :

40% of the current price of the stock plus the premium received,
minus the difference between the cost of the stock and the strike
price;

-or-

20% of the current price of the stock plus the premium received.

As you go deeper out of the money (OTM) the 20% requirement will
take precedence.

ROI is simply the premium received divided by the collateral (or
equity) required to open the position...

Example:
XYZ = 20.00, strike = 10.00, premium = 0.25
40% rule = 0.4*20 + 0.25 - ( 20-10) = -1.75
20% rule = 0.2*20 + 0.25 = 4.25
ROI = 0.25/4.25 =  5.88%

Next week, we will discuss the requirements for trading naked puts.

Good Luck!

                         *** WARNING ***
Occasionally a company will experience catastrophic news causing
a severe drop in the stock price. This may cause a devastatingly
large loss which may wipe out all of your smaller gains. There is
one very important rule; Don't sell naked puts on stocks that you
don't want to own! It is also important that you consider using
trading STOPS on naked option positions to help limit losses when
the stock price drops.
