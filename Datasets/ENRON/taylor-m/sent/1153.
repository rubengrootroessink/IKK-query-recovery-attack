Mark:

What do you know about the issue of electronic signatures?  Is this service 
or a similar service something we should further explore?

I received this solicitation from this company last week.  Do we have any 
interest in discussing anything further with them?  (all of the attachments 
appear to be messed up, but the website provides more detail)

thanks
Dave

Dave,
Thank you for the prompt reply.
There are many areas where electronic signatures can reduce business costs
and enable new applications.  But, most importantly Enron and Enron Online
needs to know they can trust an electronic signature.  AlphaTrust can
serve as the 3rd party managing your electronic signatures including risk
management.  There are many costs associated with implementing an
electronic signature service with the polices and legal requirements.  And
typically there can be a 12-18 month time frame to implement.

AlphaTrust provides the infrastructure,
AlphaTrust provides the legal framework and fraud protection across all
jurisdictions including internationally,
AlphaTrust can enable your business to get started quickly.





I will call you next week to follow-up.  If you like we can coordinate a
call with your legal counsel and my CEO who understands the laws to a
great extent.

Thank you,
Randall Whitfield
