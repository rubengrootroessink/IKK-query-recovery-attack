Who knows if this is true or not, but it is bizarre.

Press,
by Kurt Westervelt)

Stick with this.....it's worth it!  This is the strangest thing I've ever
heard.  The series of events that had to have taken place in order for
this
to happen are astounding!  At the 1994 annual awards dinner given for
Forensic Science, AAFS president Dr. Don Harper Mills astounded his
audience
with the legal complications of a bizarre death:  On March 23, 1994, the
medical examiner viewed the body of Ronald Opus and concluded that he
died
from a shotgun wound to the head.  Mr. Opus had jumped from the top of a
ten-story building intending to commit suicide.  He left a note to that
effect indicating his despondency.  As he fell past the ninth floor his
life
was interrupted by a shotgun blast passing through a window which killed
him
instantly.  Neither the shooter nor the dead man was aware that a safety
net
had been installed just below at the eighth floor level to protect some
building workers and that Ronald Opus would not have been able to
complete
his suicide the way he planned.  "Ordinarily," Dr. Mills continued, "A
person who sets out to commit suicide and ultimately succeeds even though
the mechanism might not be what he intended" is still defined as
committing
suicide.  That Mr. Opus was shot during what would apparently have been
an
unsuccessful suicide attempt because of the safety net, caused the
medical
examiner to feel that he had a homicide on his hands.  The room on the
ninth
floor where the shotgun blast emanated was occupied by an elderly man and
his wife.  They were arguing vigorously, and he was threatening her with
a
shotgun.  The man was so upset when he pulled the trigger that he
completely
missed his wife and the pellets went through the window striking Mr. Opus
as
he passed by outside.  When someone, intending to kill person "A," kills
person "B" instead; someone is still guilty of murder.  When confronted
with
a murder charge the old man and his wife were both adamant; they both
said
they thought the shotgun was unloaded.  The old man said it was his
long-standing habit to threaten his wife with the unloaded shotgun.  He
had
no intention to murder her.  Therefore, the killing of Mr. Opus appeared
to
be an accident; that is, the gun had been accidentally loaded.  The
continuing investigation turned up a witness who saw the old couple's son
loading the shotgun about six weeks prior to the fatal accident.  It
transpired that the old lady had cut off her son's financial support and
the
son, knowing the propensity of his father to use the shotgun
threateningly,
loaded the gun with the expectation that his father would shoot his
mother.
The case now reverts back to one of murder on the part of the son.  Now
comes the final twist!  Further investigation revealed that the couple's
son
was in fact, Ronald Opus.  He had become increasingly despondent over his
failed attempt to engineer his mother's murder.  This led him to jump off
the ten-story building on March 23rd, only to be killed by the shotgun
blast
passing through the ninth floor window.  The son had actually murdered
himself so the medical examiner closed the case and declared it a
suicide.
