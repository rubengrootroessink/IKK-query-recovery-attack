SOME RECENT EMAILS
***************************************************************

First of all let me say that you have the best advisory service
I have ever seen, bar none.  You truly have an UNCANNY knack for
picking winning options.  About 8 of 10 of my recent plays have
been very profitable.  Of particular note, selling puts on the
bank stocks early one day netted about 400-500% gain on a trade
I closed out THE SAME DAY!  Thanks K.W.
*****

Just wanted you to know that the special update tonight is
appreciated and provides good insight. After a while one gets 
tired of the TV commentaries regarding disaster..disaster..disaster.
Thanks - Allan B.
*****

I seldom burst into print, but I feel the need to congratulate
you on an excellent newsletter supplemented often with very
welcome alerts.

I have been a subscriber for several months. I couldn't do
without your market views and the excellent background
information you give us on stock picks. Your humor is also a
great relief when the so-called experts have a different slant
or warning every time the slightest change occurs in the economy
or politics.

With very best wishes, Jack W.

I know ya'll must take a ton of grief daily, but I really
appreciate the job that you do.  You, alone, have tripled my
portfolio in my two week trial period.  Thanks for your insight!

you a line to tell you how much i appreciate your insight into
the market. you do an excellent job at trying to find good
trends in a volatile climate. don't get discouraged over the
last few days. it is hard to find value in a market that
probably needs to catch its breath. i really look forward to
your next letter. good luck!
very truly yours, dan

Hello Jim,

I still love the newsletter.  After not following my plan a
few times due to lack of discipline, my account suffered.
But now, I have been winning the "discipline battle" the
last 6 trades and my account is at an all-time high.
Thanks. Trey
*****

Jim, Thank you for your news letter.  I have always traded options,
but never with the confidence and success that I have since I
subscribed.  I have turned $5,000.00 into over $42,500.00 in three
weeks!  AOL and CSCO have been great. Keep up the great work.

Sincerely, Andrew

You guys are the best. No only do you help us make some bucks

how do you pick so many good stocks?

Jim,  this is the first email I have sent to any newsletter and
I have tried many. i am a very highly pleased customer of your

some gains for the first time ever. Thanks for the good work. Kumar

I just wanted to let you know you have done a great job for me.
I have made $10,000 profit in just one week!!  AOL, CMGI, YHOO,

I have traded about 20 calls, and YTD annual ROI about

*****

Once again, I just want to say how much I enjoy the newsletter.
You and your team do an outstanding job. I also subscribe to
other newsletters such as McMillan's "Option Strategist", so I
appreciate quality when I see it. Your newsletter is first rate!

Thanks, David
*****

Your newsletter is the best I have ever received.  Over the
past two years I have spent hundreds of dollars on newsletters.
This is by far the best and the only one I have made money from.
I am so excited about your newsletter that I am telling lots of
friends.  I also think you give conservative advise that I
appreciate.  I am very conservative and it has taken me two
years to realize that I could do options.  With your help I have
already been successful in one week!  We own lots of Dell stock
but the options are even more fun to watch go up.  I also follow
WLA, GPS, and CSCO very closely.  We also own those stocks.
Options make a lot of sense to me when I'm familiar with the
stocks and know how they act.  I guess earnings season is also
a very good time to own options.  I am nervous about doing
options after the earnings season.   Claudia

The Option Investor has been an enormous help in my budding
trading career.  In fact, it is the first source of information
I've bought (and I've spent thousands on books, workshops, and
other website subscriptions)where I can demonstrate a direct
and nearly immediate link between the information and actual
financial success in trading.

More importantly than this perhaps is your forthright statement
about the importance of what I would call maintaining the
integrity of the relationship between you and your customers.
You are clearly a "straight shooter", and this is as apparent
in the no nonsense approach you are taking to the website
cheating problem as it is in the advice you provide in the
newsletter. Bruce
*****

I cannot tell you how much I support you in your actions.
The people who abuse the system are not only taking advantage
of you, but of all of us who are willing to pay the VERY
reasonable amount for what we get.  The return on my investment
has been several hundred times over the amount I give you
and personally I thank you for taking these steps.

Thank you, Lloyd

Jim: I want to thank you and compliment your service.  Please
feel free to post my unsolicited remarks below as a reference
to your Newsletter Service.
     Thanks for the followup on the Japan market sentiment.
It's great to know that when there is a big market event you
are on top of things for us.  I subscribed a few weeks ago and
want to say that I am most satisfied with the newsletter.
     I was experienced with stocks and options before I subscribed,
but I was kind of "trading in the dark," with a lack of self-
confidence in my strategies.  Now with the newsletter, I found
that I was pursuing the right strategies but didn't have the
confidence and trading skills to perform good executions.  The
confidence gained through the Option Investor Newsletter and the
time saved in searching for opportunities (great opportunity plays
already summarized by the newsletter) has helped me focus on "better
execution."  My results have improved dramatically.  Since early
June when I started the two-week-trial, my option brokerage account
net worth has increase from $20,000 to $70,000 today.  I also
believe that I am trading a lot smarter, actually incurring much
less risk than before.

Thanks, Tony
*****

Dear James: I would like to take a moment to thank you for the
job that you and the Option Investor staff do.  I am sure we
(subscribers) don't know half of what you guys must contend
with day in and day out to get the newletter to us.  However,
do know that you are appreciated.

    I must readily admit that I am totally addicted.  I look
forward to Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday nights.  I am like a
child at Christmas time.  When I first subscribed to your
newsletter I was somewhat unfamiliar with your format and
recommendations.   I would pick half hazardly and not plan my
execution strategy.  However, as I sat back and analyzed your
picks, paper traded for sometime, I then started actual trading.
I went from a negative portfolio to a positive within 3 weeks,
all the credit going to you guys!  I am still attempting to
concur the art of letting the profits run (I still tend to get
out a little too quick), but I am better at stopping out when
the trade hasn't gone as expected.

    Keep up the good work and I look forward to a long lasting
relationship.

Thank you, Darrel
*****

Jim:
    I just had to write you to tell you that during my first
two week free trial, your information made me $2,000 from a
$2,000 investment! Needless to say, I subscribed and since then
the website has made me an additional $2,500. All of this in less
than 30 days! I have been to Wade's WIN site free for a week
and your information is much easier to understand and use. I
haven't been this excited in years! Your site has literally
changed my life!
Steve
*****

I am just a lame rookie with options, but I profited nicely
($15K) in one week with one trade per your news letter, and it
was not from an Internet stock! I would have profited greater
from another transaction if I would have heeded "pigs get fat ,
hogs get slaughtered". I have more of your suggested options in
the works and am cautiously looking for similar returns! Thanks
for the great information. cb

HI, I have to tell you that "WE LOVE YOU GUYS"  Our life revolves
around Sun., Tue., and Thur. Thoughts, comments.  I know you work
hard to get the information out and you do a great job.

Thanks for everything,

Hello Jim, Thanks so much for the valuable information!

I have been trading stocks for many years, the last year I dug
myself an incredible hole, by investing in small caps.

I just started trading options with the encouragement, help and
guidance of your newsletter. I was able to recapture my 30 K loss
in three weeks!  and my Schwab account is back in  positive territory!

This is incredible! I am comfortable now with option trading,
using the stop loss and diversification principle coupled with
good research your suggested 'method'  works!

Thanks for the advise on the books too!   V.R.
*****

I got my first issue of your FREE two week trial and I can only
say... I AM EXCITED!!!!!

I took your Sunday recommendations and decided to find out the
results if one were to simply follow your suggestions without any
analysis of their own...

As of Wednesday... over 63% of your calls were in positive
territory with an overall gain of about 80%...
IN 2 DAYS....OUTSTANDING!!!!

This really excites me because I have some extensive knowledge in
technical analysis, so when I filter your recommendations with the
charts, I should come up with about as close as "SURE THING" trades
as I will probably ever get! :)

Thanks for the research and the recommendations... keep it up!

David G. - NEW subscriber :)

Dear Jim, Your trading rules saved me last week.  I've traded
options for years but my success has been twarted by not knowing
when to get out, staying too long, getting greedy, hoping it would
go back up, etc.

Well, a trade went the wrong way last week and normally I would have
hung on but you say so often, "If it goes down, sell it" that it
must have finally sunk in.  Though it was down by 5 for the day,
I got out with only losing the previous day's gain thanks to "The
Rules".

I love your site and newsletter. Thanks again.  BB
*****

Dear Jim:

Yours is the best I have seen bar none.  I just signed up last
week after my free trial.  I find your letter friendly and chatty,
but not condescending, as some others I won't mention.  And not
too technical!  Without trying to impress, you have done so.

Thanks so much for COF, and CSCO, both of which returned excellent
results for me.  I can't show you a new Jaguar yet, but I think you
will make me much richer. Don H.
*****

Dear Sirs, I've been VERY impressed with your service!  You do
excellent stock and market evaluations.  Your suggested plays are
obviously predominantly on target.  Your tutoring and explanations
of your thinking behind your suggestions are so clear and well
expressed ...AND APPRECIATED.
NOTHING else I've come across has helped me more in learning how
to go about trading options!  And you've helped me fine tune my
approach to stocks as well.

Thanks and keep up the good work!   Ann
*****

Hey!

Nice call on Cisco! I bought is at 2.75 as you suggested and
sold yesterday at 5 each, for a nice total return of about 80%.

Thanks!   Nelson
*****

Please charge my credit card for a quarterly subscription.
Thanks. I was about to give up on options having lost over
$3000 on my own. With your trial I was able to make that back.

Cordially, John

Jim and Crew:

I found your site by bouncing around the Internet and have been
impressed with the results you folks get. Much to my wonder here
was a special alert on Tuesday that just blew me away!
When I saw that the email was sent at 4am. I was super impressed.
Your crew had been at this all night!
I played your recommendations (bought 10 of everything -- no not
really) and made money while having a really great time.

I have tried many of the other services that are out there for
option traders BUT NO ONE has the results, refreshing commentary,
and right-on picks that your team does.

I am pleased to tell you that I am now and dues paying subscriber
and happy to be in your hands -- please keep up the good work.
