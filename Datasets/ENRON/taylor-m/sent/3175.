In case the Four Seasons doesn't work out, there are two other hotels 
downtown you might consider:  The Stephen F. Austin (an Intercontinental I 
think) and the Driskill.  Both are old (by U.S. standards) hotels that have 
been updated.  For several years after its renovation the Driskill was the 
nicest place in town - then came the Four Seasons.  The Stephen F. Austin was 
just completely redone a year or so ago - I haven't been inside but I hear 
they did a nice job.  Both are primarily business hotels so they may have 
good weekend rates.
