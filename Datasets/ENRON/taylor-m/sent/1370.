Dear Mr. Barathon,

Thank you for your very quick reply.  There will only be two of us and we 
would like to come to see the boat but unfortunately we will not have time to 
spend the day sailing.  We will be staying in St. Tropez at Residence de la 
Pinede (33)04 94 55 91 00.

Regards,

Mark Taylor

Dear Sir,

Thank you for your email and for your interest. We do have a location in
HySres, in southern France, with a Super Maramu 2000 available for
inspection and sail trials. If you want, you can make a visit of the boat
or even test her at sea on Monday, 25th September. Please tell us how many
people will come with you and confirm whether you wish a detailed visit of
the Super Maramu 2000 or if you want to spend a whole day sailing aboard.

Looking forward to hearing from you,

Best regards,


Renaud BARATHON
