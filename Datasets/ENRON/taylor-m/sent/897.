David - 

I am putting together the request for assistance from local counsel in Japan 
in preparation for opening up EnronOnline to Japanese counterparties.  If you 
have a copy of the request you sent to MSJ when you started working on this 
for Australia it would be very helpful to me.  I have what we've used in 
Europe but would be grateful for your thoughts as well.

Thanks,

Mark
