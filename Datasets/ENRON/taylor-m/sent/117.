Great Expectations - By Pinnacle Capital Advisors
**********************************************************

With a number of key corporate earnings reports due out this
week, we have highlighted below the companies that will likely
have the greatest impact on the overall market.  Keep close
track of these companies.  If they beat expectations, we are
likely to move higher.  If not, we are likely to re-test our key
support levels again.

Options traders playing the Technology sectors, watch Microsoft
on Tuesday.  Microsoft will likely dictate the climate for
the technology sector for 1Q99.

Excessive Optimism / Pessimism

Often times when companies release corporate earnings, the stock
will move/gap up or down depending on the level of expectation
built into the stock prior to the release date.  This level of
expectation can be measured, in part, by the Call/Put ratio and is
represented by our Pinnacle Index figure.  The average Pinnacle
Index is 2.0.  Therefore, an index appreciably higher than 2.0
reveals a high level of optimism while an index lower than 2.0
reveals a high level of pessimism.  For aggressive options traders,
we have highlighted companies reaching extreme expectation levels
below:

For example, the company with the highest and lowest expectation
reporting this week is Citrix (CTXS) and Bankers Trust (BT) with a
Pinnacle Index of 15.1 and 64, respectively.  This suggests that if
Citrix does not beat their estimate on Tuesday, they are likely to
sell-off.  Conversely, if Bankers Trust beats their estimate or
reports any favorable news, they are likely to move higher.

The Power of Sentiment Analysis

Last October (1998), Pinnacle Capital Advisors tracked corporate
earnings reports and advised subscribers about the impact that
excessive optimism and pessimism can have on the stocks's performance
following the release of its quarterly earnings report.  If you
recall, we identified several stocks that reached excessive sentiment
levels including Intel (INTC) and Pfizer (PFE).


Reporting                            Estimated   Pinnacle
Date        Company                        EPS      Index
--------------------------------------------------------------
Excessive Optimism:
10/13 INTL  Intel                          .79       5.2
10/13 JNJ   Johnson & Johnson              .70       3.7
10/15 AAPL  Apple Computer                 .49       3.6

Excessive Pessimism:
10/13 JPM   JP Morgan                     1.08        .4
10/12 C     Chrysler                       .87        .7
10/14 PFE   Pfizer                         .57        .9
10/13 GM    General Motors                 .98-      1.2
10/16 G     Gillette                       .30       1.3
10/14 MER   Merrill Lynch                  .56       1.5



The first is Intel (INTC).  The semiconductor powerhouse had
rallied ahead of its earnings report Tuesday night (10/13) and closed
at $83.88.  What's interesting is that they beat the street's estimate
by 9 cents and yet the stock gapped down the next morning (10/14).
And despite the 330 point Dow rate cut rally on Thursday (10/15), the
stock had trouble taking out its recent previous high of $85.88.  Here,
our sentiment analysis alerted subscribers that expectations had gotten
ahead of itself and that despite the good news, the stock had trouble
advancing.

We saw the opposite in the case of Pfizer (PFE).  This blue-chip
Pharmaceutical company had sold off more than 20% from its summer high
($120) to close at $95.50 before its release Tuesday night (10/13).
Here, Pfizer actually missed its estimated earnings by a nickel.
Although the stock initially gapped down the next morning, it quickly
rallied and closed higher. Our message: it's all about understanding
and managing expectations.


Pinnacle Index

What is the Pinnacle Index.  It is simply the put/call ratio at key
overhigh benchmark levels.  Typically, there should be two (2) calls
for every one (1) put.   So when this ratio reaches extremes levels,
it can presage key turning points in the stock.  The average Pinnacle
Index, therefore, should read 2.0.

One of the key components that separate OptionInvestor.com from any
other advisory services is our sentiment indicator or Pinnacle Index.
The Pinnacle Index is designed to measure the level of overhead
resistance at key overhead benchmark levels. This analysis can give
savvy option traders a jump on other traders.

It's important to note that the Pinnacle Index, like many
sentiment indicators, is a contrarian indictor.  This means
that the stock can and will go higher or lower despite what
our sentiment indicators might suggest.  However, our
experience has shown that the market is subject to a
precipitous sell-off if the Pinnacle Index reaches extreme
levels.
