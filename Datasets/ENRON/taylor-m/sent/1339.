First choice: New Years if Bill & Amanda can get the first week of 2001 off. 
Second choice: Another time (I guess in 2001) when everybody can be there.
Third choice: The week of Thanksgiving.
I guess I would prefer not to go for a long weekend because it takes me so 
long to get there, although the Thanksgiving weekend is pretty long & might 
work if nothing else does.

I sent an e-mail to Amanda to sound out her views.  My guess is that she will 
want to go several times.  Her usual response to a choice is to avoid it.

Since lots of things might work, do you have any preferences/choices.  Are 
you committed to an entire week?  Want to shorten it to a long weekend (or is 
the travel to much of a pain for you).I don't think there is any plan that 
will include Bill in 2000.  If we include Amanda, I think it is either Nov 
3-8 or it is Thanksgiving.  We could do a long weekend on either of those 
dates or if you want to take the whole week off, you and I could go for the 
week and Amanda could join us for part of it.  I don't know how much time you 
want to spend on this venture.  Do you want to wait until 2001?  Give me some 
idea what is your first, second, third choice.  And of course you can choose 
more than one ( I am sure Amanda will).

Wow - too many choices.  Let's see, the day of the week charters start and
end is not fixed - except that the boat has to be available on the days you
want it.  We usually went Sunday to Sunday so we could get 2 weekends in
and use the Saturday as a day to fly down.  It's much harder to get there
from Houston than NYC (fewer flights) so it pretty much takes all day to
get there.  The 3rd - 8th is a Friday through  Wed. - not optimal from the
weekend point of view but doable I suppose  - it just means a 4 day instead
of 7 day charter.  If you want to wait until Thanksgiving we could
certainly manage with the 2 of us - particularly if we got one of the
smaller boats - and it might make sense to go back to the BVI where we know
the sailing won't be all that challenging (I hear the St. Martin area can
get rougher).  Plan B sounds like fun too - and then we could all go
together later (it seems mean to go without Bill) - New Years sounds like a
blast to me!  What would you think about heading down the Friday or
Saturday before (12/29 or 30) and spending the first week of January there?
That assumes Bill can get that week off and Amanda doesn't have to be back
in school til later.  I have a couple of sailing friends here that might
like to go then too if you're interested in a slightly larger  group.
They're a lot of fun, good cooks and reasonable sailors  too!

Amanda has a break from Nov 3-8th  ( and I don't think she has classes on
Friday anyway).  Is that something the three of us can work with?
Alternatively, do you think the two of us could manage over Thanksgiving -
with amanda joining for the long weekend (fly down Thurs eve and back Mon).
I can't remember what day of the week charters begin and end. - is it set
in stone?   Plan B - we could met at the Greenbriar or DC for Thanksgiving.
I understand from Amanda that Bill is not going anywhere until 2001.  Of
course that does make New Year's eve a possibility.  If all else fails, I
did hear from Greg this week and he wants to know if we are still sailing.
And I am still looking for something to do over Christmas.

I sent Amanda & Bill an e-mail a couple of weeks ago and here is Bill's
reply.
I sent him a fairly detailed note on how we usually schedule things and
which
were the best times of year, etc.  I haven't heard anything from Amanda and
was
beginning to assume they were not really interested in a November trip.
Have
you heard anything firm from Virginia?  Bill's next-to-last paragraph tells
me
that he's getting to know Amanda - but I don't think she'll leave him alone
for
the holiday.  The real question is whether her uncanny ability will extend
to
his schedule, too.  If they still want to go we'd better make travel plans
soon
- that Thanksgiving Sunday is notoriously difficult to get seats.  If you'd
rather wait until Jan. or Feb. that's fine with me too.  Just let me know.

Hey Mark, nice to hear from you.  I am glad you enjoyed the wedding.  It
went
by so fast for me but it seems that people had a good time.  Apart from a
few
travel related glitches the honeymoon was also spectacular.  Tahiti is a
true
paradise.

I am committed to the concept of sailing in the Carribean but my problem is
that my honeymoon has put me firmly in "vacation deficit" at the SEC.
Barring any emergency congressional action I will not have enough days
available by Tgiving to truly enjoy sailing in the Carribean.  Amanda has
told me how much fun it is and I want to do it but I may need to find
another
time.  I'll check into it and let you guys know definitively very soon.
How
long to you go for?

Keep in mind though that I do not speak for Amanda.  She has an uncanny
ability to arrange her schedule so that she can participate in virtually
every vacation idea that people bring up.

I'll be in touch,  Bill.
