I don't think this person's experience is the right fit for our paralegal

Dear Enron Human Resources Department:

I am a business professional with a successful track record in process
improvement and strategic management.  I have extensive experience in the
financial services, employee benefits and legal industries.  My experience
and education have allowed me to gain strong analytical, communication and
management skills.  At each level of professional accomplishment I have been
recognized for my ability to accurately access situations, produce results
and exceed goals.

Attached below is a recent resume that will provide you with a general idea
of what I might contribute to an organization.  I would appreciate an
opportunity to meet with you so that we can discuss in detail how I might be
an asset to Enron.

Thank you for your consideration.  I look forward to meeting with you soon.

Sincerely,

Karen L. Jones
