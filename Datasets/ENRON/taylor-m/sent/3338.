I'm pretty sure this is going in across the board for US deals.  If you guys 
want to, I have no objection.  We came up with some language to insert into 
the first paragraph of the confirm indicating that it is subject to the GTC 
and incorporating it by reference.  Bob Bowen has the final version of the 
language (I think it varied slightly between various commodities).

Just as a 'heads up' we are also starting down the road of doing away with 
confirmations altogether for certain US EnronOnline transactions.  Maybe we 
should chat about that and I can give you all the details.  It's going to be 
a lengthy and painful process.

Mark, I wanted to get your thoughts on whether ECC can implement this online 
GTC policy for its financial and physical transaction completed through EOL.  
I would suspect that, if ENA has passed on this, it should be okay for ECC to 
follow suit.  Are you implementing this policy just on the financial 
transactions or across the board?

Let me know.

Thanks
Greg

Peter and Greg,

Attached below is more information on the subject of Online GTC's.  This will 
affect the financial transactions we confirm as ENA as we are currently using 
ENA's templates for these transactions.  Can we implement this change for our 
ECC financial transactions as well as for physical transactions?

Let me know.

Dianne

Good News!  We finally received approval of the language to be used for 
EnronOnline transactions 
subject to General Terms & Conditions so that we do not have to attached the 
GTC's to every 
confirmation sent.  Again, the language attached is for particular products, 
so please check with your 
respective legal groups to get their approval.

I would like to start this process next Monday, April 30, 2001.  Can everyone 
meet that deadline?  If 
this does not affect you, please reply so.


Attached is the final language (don't let the file name fool you):
