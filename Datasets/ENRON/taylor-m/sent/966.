Mark K thought the play sounded like a good idea so if you could get tickets 
for us that would be great.  My flight out isn't until around 11:00 Friday 
morning so I can always stay up late to chat!  I'll be there Thursday 
morning, too - I'm supposed to attend a lecture at 11 but am free before that 
- any Chemistry classes or labs I should sit in on?

Mark
