Mark -

Hope you had a good holiday - all too short unfortunately !

Many apologies but I seem to have mislaid the piece of paper with the name of 
the person that I need to contact to get a copy of the standard ENA legal 
opinion.  I would be grateful if you could give me their details again.

Many tks and all the best for the New Year,

Denis
