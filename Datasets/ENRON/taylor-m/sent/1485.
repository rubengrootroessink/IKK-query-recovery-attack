Just a quick note to give you as much warning as possible.  The current phase 
of the office construction project is almost finished (we have been given a 
completion date of Monday, November 20).  There is good news and bad news.  
First the bad: the office which you currently occupy will be in the next 
construction phase which will begin as soon as possible after the current 
phase is finished.    Now the good:  we have an office for you to sit in 
until your new office is ready.  Joya Davis has submitted the move request 
and will have details directly.  Your assistants can help you order boxes and 
arrange your move.
