Joao - 

I'm making another business trip to Brazil - this time just to Sao Paolo.  
I'll be there Tuesday to Thursday of this week.  Any chance you will be 
nearby?  I tried to arrange a meeting in Rio too but unfortunately our office 
there is quite small and the only people I need to see will be in Sao Paolo 
then.  I also still get to London every once in a while.  Let me know when 
you are there - maybe we can have dinner.

Mark
