Craig - 

There was nothing attached to your e-mail so I assumed you were sending 
something by hard copy - we haven't received anything yet.

Mark, I am forwarding a copy of OUC's ISDA along with a copy of their charter 
and their outside legal opinion on their ability to enter into financial 
hedges.  Could you please assign to the appropriate attorney to work on this 
ISDA.

John, I'm not sure if you are the approprite credit person or not to work on 
this. They mentioned that they have already exchanged credit information 
between OUC and Enron.  If you're not the right person, could you please pass 
it on.

I would like to push this process along to get an executed ISDA between OUC 
and Enron.  I believe that they could be a good counterparty for us.

Thanks for your help.

Craig
