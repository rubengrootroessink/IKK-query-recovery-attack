Mark,

Hi.  I am hoping you can help me.  We are putting together a cost summery of 
the events that took place in 1999.  I have come across an approval form as 
well as a cost estimate for an ECT Legal Conference in The Woodlands on 
October 28-29, 1999.  I do not have final numbers for this event.  Do you by 
any chance have a total cost?  Please let me know if you have anything that 
can help me.

Thank you,
Laura
