Mark,

All systems ready to go on Friday morning.  I thus expect to be in the office 
on Monday morning (18 Jan.).  Could you please ask one of the assistants to 
help in organising and setting up a working station (computer and the rest of 
the requisite gear).  Also, since it is a bit tricky to establish contact 
with Houston H/R, this person could perhaps arrange a card/badge for me and a 
car parking ticket (or advise me where to put the car on Monday morning).

I'm looking forward to seeing you and the rest of the Legal Dept on 18 Jan.

Martin
