Thanks for your note.  Yes, I am available for the call and have asked 
Sullivan & Cromwell to have someone available as well.  As soon as the time 
is firm, I will be able to let you know who at S&C to call.

Subject: Meeting on Tuesday?

After our meeting this coming Monday morning with you, me and Justin, I think 
we're ready to have another all hands telephone conference on Tuesday (like 
the one we had last week) to resolve the issues that have come up over the 
last week or so. Please ask your assistant to schedule something, with the 
meeting to include me, you, Justin, Mark Taylor, Louise, Elena, Andrew, Tim, 
Christopher Millard, anyone else Louise wants to attend and S&C if Taylor 
thinks they should attend. The meeting shouldn't take more than an hour. 
Following our meeting on Monday morning, we'll prepare a list of issues which 
we can circulate late Monday so people can consider them before the meeting. 
Thanks!

P.S. If necessary, we'll cancel our Tuesday afternoon legal trading meeting 
to accomodate everyone's schedules.
