How does the New Product Type Approval process work?  We have received 
several test messages but it is not clear how we look beyond the short 
description in the e-mail to see the long description (can the short 
description be set up as a hyperlink to the web-site?) or how we are supposed 
to respond (my attempted reply was rejected as undeliverable).
