Thanks for the info.  And I sure hear your --  especially re: crim pro!  On 
the evidence front, I did the same thing you did -- took it for bar purposes 
-- but I never cease to be amazed at how often it comes up in my 
non-litigator's practice.  So don't despair, it may yet be helpful.\

 I'm really looking forward to sailing too.  Just two weeks!
