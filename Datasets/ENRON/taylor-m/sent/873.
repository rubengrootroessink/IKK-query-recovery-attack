Dear Mark,

Hope you are well!

I've attached the confirmation for the EOL bankruptcy swaps where ENA will be 
the contracting entity.  I've followed the format of the online ENA swap 
confirm but kept the economics the same as for the European bankruptcy swap 
confirm.  Please let me know if you are happy with this.  

Thanks, Edmund.
