I hope you have access to e-mail in KW.  I'm down with the flu so we won't be 
able to make it.  I was really looking forward to this for a number of 
reasons - including the chance to get together with you.  I didn't have your 
phone number or e-mail address at home so I had a friend drop my work 
computer off on his way home tonight.  I've left a message for Don at home - 
sorry about late notice.

Mark
