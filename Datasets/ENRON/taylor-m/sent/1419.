My impression is that this now being handled in Global Finance.  You might 
try Jordan Mintz or Gareth Bahlmann.

Hi !!

Hope you are well and that all goes well in sunny Houston .

I have a query re. JEDI II which Carol St Clair used to deal with legally , 
apparently . Mark Evans tells me she was in your group before maternity leave 
. Do you have any idea who now deals with JEDI issues ?

Many thanks and very best wishes.

Jon
