Steve, I know Peggy is out, but could you help us with a standard bilateral, 1
year C.A. for Secretaria de Hacienda y Credito Publico ?
Rod, could you please start drafting the documentation to give direct recourse
to the sovereignty of Mexico and set up an ISDA to propose to this people ?
Mark, I know Shari is out, so I'll call you to explain this in detail.
Paul, I believe Agustin Perez from our Mexico Team will start working with you
on quotes and info to keep our presence strong with Hacienda.
Thanks and regards.

Subject:  Comments on SHCP meeting.

We have been having meetings with SHCP officials in the last 3 weeks. SHCP is
the government entity that is affected for crude price fluctuations, and has
hedged the crude exports from time to time, but they have not implemented a 
risk
management program yet. The volume of Mexico crude exports is close to 600 MM
Bbl / year, and they can hedge up to that volume.

Yesterday we have a meeting with Carlos Garcia Moreno and Rodrigo Ocejo. It is
possible that they already are hedging part of the volume, but they did not 
said
so. They were impressed with Enron's capability of taking the volume
(transaction up to 50 MM Bbl) and were interested in Enron's market view for
2000. They are interested in quotes for calls, puts and swaps for Cal 2000, 
1st
and 2nd half of 2000 and Cal 2001.

We do not know yet, what is the financial agent that they use to do this
transactions, buy we believe that it can be Nafin or Banco de Mexico.

We think it is necessary start working on the ISDA and a Confidentiality
Agreement with SHCP asap, in order to be ready when the time comes to close 
the
transaction.

We are going to continue meeting these people and start quoting them the 
periods
and instruments they are interested in. Also, we are sending them today a 
Enron
Annual Report.

Regards,

Agustin Perez
