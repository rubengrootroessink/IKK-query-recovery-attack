One day a cat dies of natural causes and goes to Heaven. There he meets the 
Lord himself. The Lord says
to the cat, "You lived a good life and if there is anyway I can make your 
stay in Heaven more comfortable,
please let Me know."

The cat thinks for a moment and says, "Lord, all my life I have lived with a 
poor family and had to sleep
on a hard wooden floor."

The Lord stops the cat and says, "Say no more," and a wonderful fluffy 
pillow  appears.

A few days later six mice are killed in a tragic farming accident and go to 
Heaven. Again the Lord is
there to greet them with the same offer.  The mice answer, "All of our lives 
we have been chased. We have
had to run from cats, dogs, and even women with brooms.  Running, running,  
running;  we're tired of running. Do
you think we could have roller skates so we don't have to run anymore?"

The Lord says, "Say no more," and fits each mouse with beautiful new roller 
skates.

About a week later the Lord stops by to see the cat and finds him in a deep 
sleep on the pillow. The Lord
gently wakes the cat and asks him how was he doing. The cat replies better 
than I could have ever expected.
And those Meals on Wheels you've been sending by are theeeeeeee best!!!"
