Mark--thanks for taking the time to talk me through our power hedge deal with 
AEI.  The more I think about it, the more I think that using your Omnibus 
Agreement is appropriate to this deal.  Who can get me an electronic copy of 
that form so I can take a look at it?  I'd like to be able to review it and 
then attempt to fit my deal into it.  Thanks.  MDS
