Do you know if Enron is trying to have any input in the selection process?

Rumor has it that Jim Newsome will be named Interim Chairman of the CFTC 
today or tomorrow.  No word yet on who will be the Bush selection for CFTC 
Chair, but Newsome wants to stay and has friends in high places.  More to 
follow.
