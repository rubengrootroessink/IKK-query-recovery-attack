Marcus:

When we were in New Orleans I mentioned that I might be planning a holiday in 
Germany - well, I've finally gotten around to scheduling it.  I'm flying into 
Munich on the 27th and leaving from Amsterdam September 9.  If you are going 
to be in the office next Monday or Tuesday (when I'll be in the London 
office), I'd really appreciate a few minutes of your time to get whatever 
suggestions you would like to make.  If you will be out next week, maybe we 
could chat by phone tomorrow or Friday.

Thanks!

Mark
