Hey Jim,

Thanks for the note.  Nothing much new to report here.  Ted was in South 
Beach last weekend but came home a day early to work.  He's still trying to 
talk me into buying a new car which I would like to do but can't figure out 
what I really want.  I'm speaking at a conference in Key West next week and 
will stay through the weekend - I think it's the only place left on the 
continent that's warm.  Nothing like Zurich here but it's been in the 40's 
and rainy - seems like forever since I've been fully warm through.

Let us know when you find a place to live

Mark
