Looks like this one is for me to review.  They will be sending these to all 
of us so that whenever one of us is out, we can let the others know to 
forward these on to whomever is appropriate.  We're supposed to get back to 
them within 24 hours.

Attached below please find language suggested for use for a AECO Daily Price 
Index for a Balance of Month transaction from Canada. I have reviewed the 
suggested changes and validated  the pricing language against the Price 
Source and consider it accurate.

Dale,

Attached is the revised balance of the month product information.  In the 
first paragraph, there is a line which needs to be deleted and I have 
highlighted this line in red.  As well, the second paragraph has two minor 
changes also highlighted in red.

If you have any questions, please let me know.  Otherwise I would appreciate 
knowing when this is available so that I can advise Jon McKay.

I have asked Jon about the same day and weekend products and he said he 
hasn't checked to see if they have been set up.  Once he has, he will let me 
know and I will then let you know.

Thanks!

Dianne
