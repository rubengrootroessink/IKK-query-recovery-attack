Subject: Equity and Debt Trading - exploratory discussion

Mark, Jeff, Jordan, Shari,

Equity and Debt Trading would like to have an "exploratory" conversation to 
consider the potential economic benefits/impact of offshore investing.  To 
support an offshore investment fund we would need to have offshore originated 
dollars.   Jeff Kinneman has suggested that we get individuals from 
Accounting, Treasury, Tax and Legal with commercial for a initial discussion.

We are trying to set up a meeting over the next two weeks to discuss.  Kelly 
Templeton will be calling you to set up a meeting.  If another person is more 
appropriate, please let me know or tell Kelly Templeton when she calls.

Many thanks. 
Sheila
