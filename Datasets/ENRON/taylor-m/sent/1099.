Mark,

I have researched and provided Brent with information regarding the two 
"Enron standard" laptops that are now being utilized.  We have decided on the 
Compaq M700 which has a little bigger keyboard (better for  a man's hands)  
and weighs a little less than the M300 model.  Please approve this order by 
forwarding this message to Janette Elbertson.  Thank you!  

Janette:

Please order a Compaq M700 Laptop for Brent Hendry.  Charge it to Mark 
Taylor's group (Co. 413 / Rc. 1157).  Brent will be here officially the first 
week of July but will be "in and out" of the office the last week of June.  
If we could have his computer up and running by June 23rd that should cover 
it.  Let me know if you need any additional information.

Thanks to both of you!
-Becky
