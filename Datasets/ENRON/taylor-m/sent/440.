Mark -  Would you be available to sit down with me Monday morning (say 
beginning at 10:30) to go over the spreadsheet?  I have quite a few comments 
on the financial transaction items that I was able to understand and several 
questions on areas I haven't yet been able to decipher.  I am particularly 
concerned about the Weather Products generally and the Floating Prices for 
all financial products (the Index tab).  If you could let me or my assistant 
know so I can work out my calendar for the day I'd appreciate it (I've 
blocked out 2 hours but it might not take that long).  Unfortunately I'm 
leaving town mid-afternoon so I have to get these wrapped up.  I'm at x37459.

Thanks!

Mark

p.s. - It might make sense to have somebody from the Confirmation Desk come 
too - what do you think?
