I don't see any problems.  It will become more challenging as we start 
thinking about trading.

Mark:

Apparently our people are already working with Louise Kitchen.  The issue I 
described yesterday is described below.  Basically we want to make reference 
to Enron Online in an informational site we will possibly be participating in 
Colombia.  Please let me know if you see any problem with this.

Thank you.

I talked to Louise Kitchen (MD Enrononline) about how our group could  
leverage on  enrononline for  our plans of a first step with an informational 
site in Colombia  to move  later to a transactional site as Enron stars  
trading activities in Colombia.

What I proposed to Louise is to  get  ISA to include enrononline in the 
"other sites of interest" data  for  Colombia and to also have enrononline to 
include data on Colombia in the enrononline informational site .  She says 
that it is very easy to include this information  and that in principle she 
doesn't  think there is a problem in linking enrononline to ISA if it is 
going to be only for the informational site.  

She referred me to Rahil Jafry (content) to discuss the process to make the 
Colombia information to be included in the site. I talked to him and we 
scheduled a meeting for Friday at 8:30AM.

Please confirm ASAP if you will be available for this meeting

Thanks, Maria Elena
