Thanks for your note - that will make packing easier.

My flight is CO4240 from Houston Intercontinental Airport arriving at 10:29 
Wednesday night - operated by Continental Express.  I don't like to take 
those smaller planes but at least this one is a jet and is a non-stop 
flight.   It makes for fewer delays and it's that much harder for them to 
lose your luggage.
