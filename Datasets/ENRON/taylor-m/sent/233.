Dorice,

Please fax the bill to me at 713-646-3490 and just put the original in the 
regular interoffice mail.

My RC is 1157

Thanks for your help.  

Mark

Dear Mark,
Just received confirmation that the other Mark Taylor from London has left 
Enron. Hence the letter must be for you. As per your instruction, I opened 
the said letter and found that it's a bill from them - Crawford Bayley & Co - 
asking for payment (re: derivative).
Kindly advise if you want me to fax the letter to you or if you prefer it to 
be mailed / couriered over. Appreciate if you could furnish me with your fax 
and RC numbers as well.

Thanks,
Dorice.
