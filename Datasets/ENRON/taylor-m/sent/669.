Bryan Seyfried is due to visit Houston next Tuesday arriving in Houston 
Tuesday afternoon until Friday mid morning. Bryan has requested an hour with 
all of you if possible.

I would be grateful if you or your assistants can return to me with your 
availability on Wednesday Thursday or Friday morning.

Thank you for your assistance

Claire Dunnett
