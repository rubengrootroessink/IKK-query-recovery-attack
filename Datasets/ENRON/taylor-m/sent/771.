Subject: Houston Trip

I thought it might be worthwhile for me to spend a day in Houston sometime in 
early February to meet with you and discuss matters affecting the Canadian 
business.  I was tentatively planning on Thursday, February 10th.

If you agree, please have your assistant let me know of your availability on 
that day, and my assistant Nella will coordinate an itinerary.  

Regards, Peter
