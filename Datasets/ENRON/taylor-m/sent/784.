I glanced at the power product description (what I could see of it) - Is it 
definately a physical transaction?  where does the power get delivered?  If 
it really is physical, I'll need to get one of the power trading lawyers to 
look it over.

Subject: Please approve two new Product Types

Two new Product Types have been created and require approval. In the 
DataManager you will find:

US Jet Kero Fin Swap - which you will find in Partialy Approved

and

US West Power Phy Spd - which you will find in Awaiting Approval.

The automated e-mail function associated with the notification of parties 
when a Product Type is created or approved is not functioning, and we are 
working to have the problem fixed. In the interim, please approve the Product 
Types and send me an e-mail when you are done.

As you would expect the respective commercial areas are eager to have these 
Product Types availabble for trading.
