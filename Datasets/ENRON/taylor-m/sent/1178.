If you need more, there is a proposal from the documentation committee for a 
new alternative for calculating termination amounts (we heard about it in 
Amsterdam) that I think will be particularly attractive to the energy 
markets.  I don't know where this stands officially (I haven't heard any 
developments since Amsterdam) but I can find out from Bob Pickle if you want.

We should include ISDA energy definitions, CFTC matters re energy and an 
overview of power deregulation developments in North America.  I might also 
add a few items about international developments and the EEI physical power 
trading form.  I am thinking 4 slides at the most.  Is that what you want?
