One day, while walking down the street, a highly successful lawyer was 
tragically hit by a bus and killed. His soul arrived up in Heaven, where he 
was met at the Pearly Gates by St. Peter himself.

"Welcome to Heaven," said St. Peter. "Before you get settled in, though, it 
seems we have a problem. You see,  we've never once had a lawyer  make it 
this far and we're not really sure what to do with you."

"No problem-just let me in," said the lawyer
 
"Well, I'd like to, but I have higher orders. What we're going to do is let 
you have a day in Hell and a day in Heaven, and then you can choose whichever 
one you want to spend an eternity in."  

"Actually, I think I've made up my mind...I prefer  to stay in Heaven," said 
the lawyer 

 "Sorry, we have rules," said St. Peter, and with that, he put the lawyer in 
an elevator  and it went  down-down-down to Hell.

The doors opened and the lawyer found himself stepping out onto the putting 
green on a beautiful golf course. In the distance was a country club, and 
standing in front of him were all of his friends and fellow lawyers with whom 
he had worked. They were all dressed in black tie and evening gowns and 
cheering for him. They ran up and kissed him on both cheeks and they talked 
about  old times. They played an excellent round of golf, and that night went 
to the country club where he enjoyed an excellent steak and lobster dinner.

The lawyer even got to meet the Devil, who was actually a woman and very good 
looking.  He had a great time telling jokes and dancing.  In fact, the lawyer 
was having such a good time, that before he knew it, it was time to leave.

 Everybody shook his hand, thanked him for coming  and waved goodbye as he 
got on the elevator.

 The elevator went up-up-up and opened back at the Pearly Gates, where he 
found St. Peter waiting for him. "Now it's time to spend a day in Heaven," he 
said.

 So the lawyer spent the next 24 hours lounging around on clouds and playing 
the harp and singing. He had a great time, and before he knew it, his  24 
hours were up. St. Peter came and got him.

 "So, you've spent a day in Hell and you've spent a day in Heaven. Now you  
must choose your eternity," he said.  The lawyer  paused for a second, and 
then replied, "Well, I never thought I'd say this. I mean, Heaven has been 
really great and all, but I think I had a better time in Hell."  So St. Peter 
escorted him to the elevator and again he went down-down-down, back to Hell.  

 When the doors of the elevator opened, the lawyer found himself standing in 
a desolate wasteland covered in garbage and filth. He saw his friends and 
fellow lawyers were dressed in rags and were picking up the garbage and 
putting it in sacks.

The Devil appeared before the lawyer.  She now had horns sticking out of her 
head, fire spit out her ears and nose  and she had a very evil laugh

The lawyer stammered:   "I don't understand.  Yesterday, I was here and  
there was a golf course and a country club and we ate lobster and danced and 
had a great time. Now all there is a wasteland of garbage and all of my 
friends and fellow lawyers look overworked and miserable." 

The Devil looked at the lawyer and smiled.

 "Yesterday we were recruiting you; today you're ours."
