Jon,

I had a glance over the written paper from Sullivan & Cromwell as to FX 
Transactions, and it seems to me that there would be fewer US regulatory 
issues (should there be any), if we were to use MG Brokers Inc, the FCM 
entity.  Are there any other reasons why we would not want to use this entity?

[Mark/Alan/Marcus - I have separately sent you by email the Sullivan & 
Cromwell paper]

Thanks.
Justin

Jon, 

My suggestion would be for the FX business be run out of a NON FCM firm in 
the states (NY) since it is a non-regulated product. 

If you have an questions please call me at x5845.
