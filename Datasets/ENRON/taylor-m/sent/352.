I will be handling the derivatives side of the ETOL transaction this time so 
future communications should probably come to me directly.  I will be 
reviewing the ISDA draft this weekend and it would be helpful if I could get 
some sort of description of the overall transaction.  Is there a term sheet 
or executive summary of the deal?  If so, my fax # is (713)646-3490.
