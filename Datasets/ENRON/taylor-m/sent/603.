Subject: Bankruptcy bill

I just received notice that the Senate Bankruptcy Bill (S. 625) will be on 
the Senate floor around 3:00 pm today.  
As of a meeting I had yesterday afternoon, all of our issues look like 
they're in good shape.

Just to re-cap for everyone: 

1)  DOI proposal on oil & gas leasing -- will not be in managers' amendment 
and should not be offered on the floor.
2)  Enron's techincal correction on production payments -- is safely in the 
bill and will pass if the whole bill passes.
3)  Enron's additions/changes on derivatives language -- should be inserted 
at Senator Nickles' behest into the managers' amendment before the bill goes 
to the floor this afternoon...will get confirmation soon.

I'll be in touch shortly with updates.....

Jeff
