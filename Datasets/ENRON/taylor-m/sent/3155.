Ohmygawd!  An e-mail message from Hal!  Now I know we really ARE in the 21st 
century.

I also get to Key West on the 24th and will be there until the 28th and don't 
need a place to stay because I will be at the conference hotel.  Ted will get 
there Friday eve.  I have meetings during the days Thursday & Friday and Sat. 
morning; dinner on Friday is also a scheduled event for me.  Otherwise I 
don't think we have specific plans.  Looking forward to it!

Mark
