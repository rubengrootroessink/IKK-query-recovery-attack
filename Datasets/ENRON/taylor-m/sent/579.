I'm most concerned about the internet aspect of things now - this is new 
advice we are requesting and I would not expect it to be the lion's share of 
the expense - presumably the update portion will be relatively easy.

Subject: Mexico advice

Per Shari this a.m., we had already requested an update on Ritch, Heather's 
legal advice from another law firm in Mexico, Lopez Vallardi.  You have 
already authorized payment of the bill.  The fax requesting an update from 
Ritch, Heather went out yesterday.  What would you like to do?
