If they've done it, it was without consulting me.  Other than the content 
stuff (e.g. which provide links to Reuters) I don't think there is anything 
out there yet.

Has EOL done any sort of linking arrangement with a third party?  We are 
trying to make sure that we know if there is any precedent for the Kiodex 
deal.  I understood that there have not been any other similar deals, but 
wanted to make sure.
