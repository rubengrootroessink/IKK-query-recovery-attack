Thanks Justin - I was planning to come over some time shortly after the first 
of the year.   A month or two ago Mark H. mentioned that there might be an 
ISDA meeting in January that he wants me to attend so I'll probably try to 
schedule something around then.  I believe that's around the 28th.  Let's try 
to set up dinner again!

Hi Mark,

The document we use is an adaption of the Enron Master Swap Contract, but 
tailored for a single one-off swap deal.

When are you over next?

Hope to see you shortly!

Justin

What documents do we use for these deals?  Is it the German translation of 
our Industrial Master?

BEB are jointly owned by Esso & Shell
Plain vanilla swap
Enron pays floating
Term of 1 -3 years
Value between DEM 250,000 - DEM 10,000,000

I will keep you posted of new developments.
