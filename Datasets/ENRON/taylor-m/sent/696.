Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.  I never did come up with a good 
solution last year to the "cat climbing the Christmas tree" problem except 
fastening the glass ornaments really tight so when she climbed up inside the 
tree they didn't shake off.  This year she seems content to just hide 
underneath the tree and hasn't been climbing up inside it - maybe she's just 
gotten too big.  I agree that the mouse traps sound mean - what about 
double-sided tape?  I understand the cats hate stepping on the sticky stuff 
so will leave the area alone afterwards (this was suggested as a 
discouragement to jumping on kitchen countertops but might work under the 
tree).  And of course, the lower branches of the tree are reserved for wooden 
and metal ornaments - nothing breakable.

Christmas is coming again, and in reviewing our mail, I came across your
"problem".  Did you come up with any solution?? A friend of ours (non-cat
owner) suggested putting mouse traps under the tree - a couple of paw snaps
and maybe no more??  Sounded cruel to me, especially for my oldest cat (13
years).
     We have used pepper in some cases in the garden, but in the house, this
would probably be more damaging to the humans than our 4 footed friends :-)
     If you have had any luck last year, please let us know, and we can post
it on our web page which we are revising.  Others would find it interesting
and perhaps amusing as well.
     Looking forward to seeing you again this Christmas,
               Peter from Ticonderoga Farms
