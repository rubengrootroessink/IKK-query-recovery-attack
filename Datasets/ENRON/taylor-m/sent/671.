I have spoken with Martin and he is going to forward some proposed language 
to me.  I will need to draft a reply letter to try and solve their issue.

I received a call from Martin Gajewski (612-984-3033) with Cargill Energy. He 
would like to make sure that the Master Agreement is the contract of 
resolution for terms and conditions of the product. He is specifically 
inquiring about paragraph 3F in the Electronic Trading Agreement. He would 
like a call back as soon as possible. Is it possible for you to contact him 
today?

Thanks,
