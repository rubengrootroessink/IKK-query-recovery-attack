Just a heads up - Mark H. asked me to set up a day that he and I could come 
to your office to discuss the legal issues surrounding electronic 
confirmations of transactions generally but in particular those done over 
EnronOnline.  I'll check with his assistant and get a couple of potential 
dates.
