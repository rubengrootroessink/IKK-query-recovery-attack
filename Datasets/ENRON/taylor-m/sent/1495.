Hello from Texas.  It's probably been about six years since we last spoke but 
I thought I'd drop you a line to see how you were doing.  I saw Pete Datos 
for brunch when I was in town a couple of years ago and he seemed to be fine 
but I have been very bad about staying in touch with people.  Ted Bockius & I 
are still together - he works at an internet start-up company doing their 
public relations work.  I'm still a corporate lawyer at Enron working on 
financial contracts and e-commerce stuff.  I get to nyc 3 or 4 times a year 
so we should get together for a drink or a meal some time and catch up.

Hope you are well.

Mark
