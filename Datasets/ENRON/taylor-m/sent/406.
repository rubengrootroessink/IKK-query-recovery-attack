Join us for the first Travel Service Forum sponsored by the Travel Agency in 
the Park.  Please mark your calendar as follows:

Date:  Wednesday, August 18, 1999  
Time:  10:00am - 11:00am      -or-     2:00pm - 3:00pm
Location  EB 5c2

Topics addressed at this forum will include travel savings opportunities and 
travel transaction service charges, but more importantly, TAP and Enron 
Travel Management are looking for suggestions from travelers and travel 
arrangers concerning additional services that would make booking travel 
easier.  We will also discuss services that are currently provided that 
travel arrangers may not be aware of.

We welcome all travel questions.  Send your questions to Tracy Ramsey via 
e-mail by Friday, August 13th.   All questions will be answered at the 
forum.  Answers will also be distributed via e-mail for those who cannot 
attend.
 
Our intent is for this forum to be interactive.  Service comments and 
suggestions are encouraged.  A pair of airline tickets for travel within the 
US 48 will be rewarded for both the best and worst service stories (no 
fiction allowed).  E-mail, or fax (713-646-5951) your service experience to 
Tracy Ramsey before August 13th.  

Forum participants please r.s.v.p to Cheryl Slone via e-mail 
cslone@ect.enron.com
Space is limited to 75 per session.

We look forward to seeing you on August 18th!
