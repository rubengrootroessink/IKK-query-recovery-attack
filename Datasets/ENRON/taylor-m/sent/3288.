Sorry for the delay - the general rule is that we will pay for a reasonable 
usage plan (huge numbers of minutes don't count as reasonable) but the phone 
itself is your own.

Good Morning!

Mark,
I am in the process of obtaining a cellular phone for Cheryl Nelson.  I have 
heard mixed information as to whether the company pays for the actual phone, 
or just the service.  Would you mind clarifying what your procedure for the 
reimbursement of the cel phones.  At this point, I am believing that the 
company will only pay for the service, not the phone itself.  Thanks for your 
attention.  Keegan, 5-3317
