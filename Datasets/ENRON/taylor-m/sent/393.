I understand that you may be in the Houston office at some point this week.  
If so, I would like to get a few minutes on your schedule to talk about South 
American Legal staffing issues.  Could you give me a call (713-853-7459) or 
drop me an e-mail with what might work for you?  If you are not actually in 
the office but have some time to talk on the phone, that would work too.

Thanks,

Mark
