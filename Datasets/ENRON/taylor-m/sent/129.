*************************************************************

The Internets blew out and techs followed. The broader market
took all day to catch up.


After another night passed without a global meltdown the
market got off to a cautious start this morning. The Dow
traded in a narrow range until a small dip at noon but the
dip appeared to be the signal for buyers to come off the
sidelines.

The techs jumped out to a quick lead and the Nasdaq hovered
in the high +30 range for what seemed like forever but then
finally surged to another record close.

The combination of strong earnings reports and multiple
stock splits powered the market forward. As soon as traders
saw the market was not going down after the bump at the open
they jumped in not wanting to be left behind.

IBM surprised no one when they announced a 2:1 split.
MCD also announced a 2:1 and joined the recent ranks of
other splitters MSFT and XRX who announced yesterday.
The stock split craze is not over yet. BRCM and EBAY both
announced splits after the close. EBAY a 3:1 and BRCM 2:1.

It appears that nothing can stop MSFT as it added 9.69
today (they are over +15 for the week).  After such a
strong move, we are looking for some kind of pullback.
The rest of the Nasdaq 100's top four did well too.
INTC rose 6.31 while CSCO jumped up 3.69 and DELL leaped
up another 3.63.  Definitely a good day for the techs.

Not to be outdone, AOL added $9.00 in anticipation of
their own earnings announcement tomorrow.  Odds of a
split are strong but there is always an increased
risk associated with holding over earnings.  It wouldn't
surprise us to some profit taking before the close
tomorrow (quite similar to what happened to SUNW the
day of their earnings).

Compaq Computer announced today that they were going to
spin off Alta Vista as a separate company. This positive
news fired up the Internets early in the day.

As if they needed to add any fuel to the Internet explosion
Amazon announced earnings (or lack thereof) that beat the
street by +.04. That along with the EBAY and BRCM splits
had all the parties celebrating after the bell. EBAY was
up +18 and AMZN +7 in after hours. No numbers were available
for BRCM.

The market internals were negative until the last hour.
It just seemed that the buyers were holding back and only
reluctantly moving back into the market like swimmers in
the ocean after a shark sighting. Everyone KNEW they
should be buying but they wanted someone else to go first.

The fear of being Greenspamed on Thursday was probably
weighing on some and lingering Brazil/China worries on
others. The market is still a little top heavy here after
the big run in recent weeks. Yes we backed off -500 points
but some say this was not enough. We have always expected
the better than expected earnings would have traders
re-evaluating their estimates for 1999. Now it appears
that the current S&P average of companies reporting is
a +6.3% year over year increase in earnings. The historical
average is around +7% but due to the global slowdown the
current estimates had been for only +5% growth.

With almost 50% of the S&P-500 already reported we are
seeing a better than 2:1 ratio of positive surprises
compared to negative surprises.

We could have some profit taking again Wednesday night
as fear of Greenspan takes hold but we feel that he will
not harm the market intentionally. Almost nothing can harm
this market. Sure there will be some dips but for the next
two weeks the trend should be up. After the two up days
this week we could actually see some drop at the open again
tomorrow as minor profit taking occurs.


Good Luck

The OEX Skybox is Back - New & Improved
***********************************************************

Based upon subscriber demand, the OEX Skybox is coming back.
OptionInvestor.com is please to announce that Pinnacle
Capital Advisors will be bringing its popular OEX Skybox back
to OI's advisory website this weekend and updating it DAILY.

And what better day to bring the OEX Skybox back than on
Superbowl Sunday, January 31st.  Unlike other OEX trading
systems, the OEX Skybox was designed to give subscribers a
"top down" view of this popular S&P 100 index option.  And in
a time of market volatility and uncertainty, sometimes one
needs to step away from the trading pit to see the big
picture from the "Skybox" and explore a broader range of
trading strategies and opportunities.

The OEX Skybox was first introduced by Pinnacle on November 1,
1998 and its team of experienced OEX traders generated an
impressive 292% over two short months.  The OEX Skybox will
supercede the OEX trading Pit and offer more ways for
subscribers to participate in the popular index option.

"We are excited to deliver the OEX Skybox to the number one
option advisory service on the Internet", says Austin Tanner,
Pinnacle's president.  According to Pinnacle, one of the
pitfalls of trading the OEX is getting caught up in the
intraday ticks and overtrading.  The focus of the OEX Skybox
is benchmark trading and gives OI subscribers winning trading
opportunities without all the noise.

What's unique about the OEX Skybox is Pinnacle's disciplined,
market-neutral trading approach that initiates trades at key
turning points in the market.  These turning points or
"benchmarks" are determined using time-tested technical and
sentiment indicators.

The new and improved DAILY OEX Skybox service will provide a
nightly OEX market wrap on the website that outlines
Pinnacle's OEX market posture and option strategies for the
next day.  During each trading day, the OEX Skybox will be
updated in realtime at three key time periods during the day.
The benefit of our fixed time period updates is that
subscribers can count on getting key trading instructions
when they login.

Nightly Strategy:
OEX Market Wrap           8:00 -  8:30pm EST

Daily Realtime Updates:
Before the Open           9:00 -  9:30am EST
After the Opening        11:00 - 11:30am EST
Before the Close          3:00 -  3:30pm EST

The nightly updates are designed for OEX traders who want to
trade the OEX but can't follow the OEX tick by tick during
the day.  The daily real-time updates give more active
day traders the ability to initiate and protect positions
quicker based upon fast developing news and events.


The change over will take place starting with Sunday's
newsletter and Mondays trading.

industry sectors including the NASD 100, Hardware and
Software.  We have also turned Neutral across Drug and
Heathcare sectors after checking up just above its short-term
averages.  We caution investors that several key industry
sectors are still trading at or below their 50-day moving
averages including Banking, Insurance, Airlines and Oil & Gas.

Market Sentiment - By Pinnacle Capital Advisors
******************************************************

Tuesday, January 26, 1999

Watch Option Call/Put Activity

Despite economic uncertainly in Brazil, we did not see an
increase in put activity over the past couple of days.  This
suggests that we DO NOT have strong underlying sentiment support
Next, we are focused on Call activity, particularly following
favorable earnings reports and stock splits.  If the options
speculators get ahead of themselves, it could presage a near
term top.

One positive development is the Market Volatility Index
(VIX) has closed BELOW 30.0% (29.35%).  This has Bullish overtones especially 
if the VIX resumes its declining trend which began back on October 8th.

Other sentiment indicators are still flashing BEARISH
overtones over the near-term including the Investors
Intelligence survey (60% Bullish) so we advise subscribers to
tightly protect their long positions.  Any questions regarding
market sentiment can be directed at:

The Power of Expectation Analysis

It has often been said that the crowd is right during the
market trends but wrong at both ends.  Measuring and
evaluating the sentiment of the crowd, therefore, can give
savvy option traders a decided edge.

PICKS WE DROPPED
****************
When we drop a pick it doesn't mean we are recommending a sell
on that play. Many dropped picks go on to be very profitable.
We drop a pick because something happened to change its
profile. News, price, direction, etc. We drop it because we
don't want anyone else starting a new play at that time.
We have hundreds of new readers with each issue who are
unfamiliar with the previous history for that pick and we
want them to look at any current pick as a valid play.

CALLS:
******

AMGN $112.75 1.44 (-1.88) Amgen is an example of a stock that
should have been bought using the target shooting approach.
If you tried target shooting, you may have been filled in the
early morning and wound up with a profitable trade.  Amgen was
down nearly $4.00 in the first hour of trading Monday. In the
middle of the day, it climbed back to hover around $114.00
until the close. Today the trend was down again until late in
the day, when buyers moved in to buy the dip, but still left
it lower on the day. While the Nasdaq is up strong, Amgen is
not performing the way we had hoped, so we are dropping it.
However, there is the possibility of a split announcement
with earnings.  Unfortunately, there is more than one earnings
date available for AMGN.  Some sources say Jan. 27th others
say Jan. 28th.  AMGN last split 2:1 in August of 1995 in the
mid-90s.

T $86.88 -2.75 (-1.37)  Earnings announcement (met
expectations), share buyback, stock split, TCI merger --
the news is already out.  Right now, there's not much left
to move AT&T higher.  To be good plays, we think almost two
times a company's normal volume should produce nice gains.
Instead, over the last 2 days, AT&T went down in a strong
upward market.  In short, the play looks over for now so
we are dropping AT&T.

QWST $56.13 -2.56 (-4.00)  QWST has shown some weakness so
far this week.  It dove -$4.00 even in a market that seems
to be moving upwards.  On Tuesday, Lehman Brothers cut its
rating to outperform from their previous buy recommendation.
They think competition will increase from other companies
like MCI WorldCom Inc. and AT&T.  By taking a look at their
chart, it is easy to see that QWST is on the downside of the
hill. We are dropping Qwest as one of our plays until it
makes a definite turn-around and regains some upward
momentum.

PRIA $32.19 -.81 (-3.69) PRIA gave us a good, steady
momentum run.  But earnings are only 2 days away, and it
looks like it is rolling over and heading lower, so we are
dropping it.  Remember, we don't recommend holding over
earnings due to the increased risk.  Make your own decision
based on your risk/reward profile.

MCHP - $32.00 1.25 (1.81)  Stock recovered nearly $2 after
being downgraded by Alex Brown. Stock trading below
consolidation of $36-40 but above last Novembers break out
price of $30.00. Dropping after stock appears to holding at
retracement price of $30.

PKN - $96.31  5.44 (5.00) Advanced higher with broad market
off of 50 day moving average.  Dropping until stock rolls
over again.

PICK NEWS - CALLS
*******************************************************

EMC $101.75 -.25 (+3.25) EMC announced earnings today and beat
estimates by 2 cents per share.  Revenue for the quarter
increased 36% over the year ago period and net income increased
54% versus the same period last year.  EMC also projects
revenue growth in 1999 to be 30% or more and sales to pick up
in Asia.  Software revenues grew by 175%.  EMC traded down only
a little today, which is good news since they didn't blow away
the estimates.  EMC still has some room to move before it runs
into the 52 week high it set last week.

UTX $117.25 +1.44 (+2.69) UTX set a new 52 week high today at
$117.63.  The downgrade that UTX got after the close on Friday
really didn't impact it all that much.  UTX traded flat for the
first half of Monday and then started up.  We haven't had any
news on UTX so it is living off of its earnings release last
week and the upward movement of the Dow.  Remember when trading
UTX, it is a Dow 30 component and is very Dow sensitive.

ORCL $52.88 +1.81 (+3.00) We said ORCL might be a candidate for
some target shooting around its 10 day moving average, but it
hasn't been anywhere near it this week.  It was good to see
ORCL move through $52 today.  It had been having some trouble
with this level.  In the news, ORCL announced new software for
oil exploration and production companies.  It will allow oil
industry co-venture partners and newly merged oil companies to
share information and monitor asset performance asset
performance quickly, easily and collaboratively.  The oil
industry can use all the help they can get given the low price
of oil these days.  The new software uses ORCL's new Internet
database  Oracle8i.

DELL $88.50 +3.63 (+5.50)  Without news or
fanfare, Dell set a new all-time closing high today on
slightly less than average volume, indicating a lack of
sellers.  Dell is now sitting at its resistance of $88.50.
If Dell can push through this on more than 18 million
shares, the sky is the limit on its way to earnings
scheduled for February 16 after the close.  If volume
doesn't materialize, that's OK.  It just means that Dell
will be a little more susceptible to a pullback.  In
Technology Business Research's 4th Quarter Corporate IT
Buying Behavior and Customer Satisfaction Study, conducted
with 300 F1000 IT Managers, Dell continues as the number
one vendor for customer satisfaction across notebook,
desktop and server platforms.  Nice chart; its not too late
to scale into a position for earnings.  Dips are buyable,
but would rather confirm upward movement first.

CSCO $107.13 +3.69 (+4.32)  Thank goodness
for the last hour of trading.  Without it, CSCO would be up
only $2 this week; not very inspiring considering CSCO is
the third largest component of the NASDAQ 100, which set a
new high today.  Cisco's saving grace: genuine buying
interest (not just market sympathy) shows volume 11% above
average in today's trading.  We are playing CSCO as a split
candidate and earnings run.  CSCO has enough shares
authorized to announce a 3:2 split on February 2 after the
close, along with earnings, just 5 trading days away.  CSCO
continues receive new awards for building the new wave of
telecom technology.  Today, CSCO was selected as Sprint's
primary supplier of DSL technology for building out "last
mile" broadband access solutions to Sprint's next-
generation Sprint ION(SM), Integrated On-Demand Network,
and for DSL-based services for customers of Sprint's Local
Telecommunications Division (LTD), beginning in 1999
(Business Wire).  The run has begun.  Dips are buyable.
Confirm upward movement first and use stops to protect your
profits.

AOL $154.84 +8.84 (+14.40)  Whew!!  All we
can say is "It's about time".  In Sunday's letter, we noted
that we expected a bounce off the moving average, out of
consolidation running toward earnings.  We got it.  Volume
has been slightly below average this week causing us slight
anxiety.  But with a 14-point gain in 2 days, we'll get
over it.  Tomorrow, after 5:00 p.m. ET, AOL announces
earnings along with what we also hope to be a split
announcement; probably 2:1, although there are enough
shares outstanding to declare a 3:1.  We expect great
results from the record number of new subscribers and
surprising Holiday sales volumes. We don't normally
recommend holding over earnings so evaluate your risk
tolerance if you opt to hold through on this play.
Intestinal fortitude still required.

WCOM $77.94 +0.25 (+3.06)  WCOM should have
performed better today given the new NASDAQ record, but
we're still up $3 for the week under it's resistance level
of $80 on slightly higher than average volume.  To be safe,
wait for a pullback confirmed by reversal, or until WCOM
breaks $80 and holds.  The U.S Supreme Court's ruling
yesterday to force the baby bells to open their markets to
competition had little effect on moving the price up.  A
downgrade issued by Kauffman Bros. from "buy" to "hold"
didn't help.  Confirm sector movement before starting a new
play.
