Robbi:

The CFTC issued a Regulatory Framework for some new regulations in late 
February, a copy of which is attached.  No proposed regulations have resulted 
but could come out at any time now.  There is also some activity on the Hill 
(bills percolating through various committees: House Banking, House 
Agriculture and Senate Agriculture) which are also of interest.  We have been 
monitoring these developments and I'd be happy to talk them over with you.  
Please give me a call if you'd like at x37459.

Mark

Do you have anything you can forward to Robbi (she is one of the lawyers 
working on bandwidth trading issues now for EBS) about new developments with 
the CFTC?

Alan,

  I understand that there are new CFTC regulations scheduled for release that 
may impact our trading world. Do you have any info about these proposed 
changes?
