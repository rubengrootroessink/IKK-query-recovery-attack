Torrey:

I am the lawyer in ECT legal responsible for our relationship with the NYMEX 
and monitoring our compliance with NYMEX position limits.  Phillipe Travis 
tells me you may be able to help him in preparing the reports of our 
positions with the option delta factored in.  Thanks very much for your 
assistance.

Mark
