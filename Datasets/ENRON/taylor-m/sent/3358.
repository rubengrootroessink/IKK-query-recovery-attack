		 Subject: dinner Weds. night in San Antonio

A few of us North America types from Lance Schuler's group have plans with 
John Novak, Sami Arap, and other colleagues from the Enron South America team 
for dinner on Weds. night. We would be honored if you would join us.  We are 
dining at :

La Fogata
2427 Vance Jackson Rd.
San Antonio, Texas
(210) 340-1337

La Fogata is approx. ten minutes from the hotel by cab.   Please just let me 
know if you can attend by 10 am tomorrow so that I can expand our reservation 
appropriately.  I hope to see you tomorrow.
