John - In case you need this right away, I've made a few changes below and 
this is probably adequate.  If you have a little more time, I can polish it 
up a bit tomorrow.  Just let me know.

Dear Mark,

Please review the attached language that I have drafted that I would like to 
include with a single or several spreadsheets that I hope to email to several 
prospective dayrate financial customers.

"This spreadsheet (or any portion of this spreadsheet) is for your company's 
private use and may not be disclosed to any other entity (including 
affiliates) without the prior written consent of Enron North America.  This 
spreadsheet is provided as is and without warranties of accuracy or fitness 
for a particular purpose or any other warranty of any kind, all of which are 
expressly disclaimed.  None of the spreadsheet's calculations can be 
represented as accurate; they are being provided herein as indicative and for 
discussion purposes only.  The providing of this spreadsheet does not serve 
to place ENA in a fiduciary or  financial advisor's role; you should evaluate 
and understand the terms, conditions, and risks of all financial dayrate 
transactions before making your decisions with respect thereto.  Any 
associated transaction(s) are also subject to negotiation of mutually 
acceptable definitive agreements, satisfactory credit arrangements and the 
approval of the respective management's of our two companies. This 
spreadsheet is not intended to create a binding or enforceable contract nor 
is it an offer or a commitment to enter into any transaction."


Thanks,

John
