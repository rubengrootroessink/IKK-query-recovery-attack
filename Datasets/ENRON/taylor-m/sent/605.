Would it work if we picked you up in the USVI?  I know it's possible to fly 
into St. Thomas either directly from New York or through San Juan and you 
could take a ferry to St. John (still part o the USVI) where we could pick 
you up.  It's a bit of a hassle since we have to clear the boat into the US 
and then back to the BVI but I've done it a couple of times before.  The 
timing might be difficult since we can't possibly get the boat to St. John 
before the afternoon of the 22nd.  If you're nervous about sailing into the 
BVI, we could stick around St. John for a few days.  You might check the 
cruising guide & see what it says about the US side of things - places to 
go/anchor, etc.
