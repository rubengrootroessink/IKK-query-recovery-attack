		 Subject: Letter to House Rules Committee Supporting Netting Amendment


The Bond Market Association and ISDA have circulated the attached letter in
support of our amendment package to other trade associations asking for
their decision about joining the letter by noon tomorrow.  The purpose of
the letter is to signal widespread support for the netting amendment
package.  It has been proposed that individual firms also have the
opportunity to sign the attached letter. To that end, would you please let
me know if your firm will be or will not be in a position to sign the letter
tomorrow.  Many thanks --   Stacy
