Dear Shari,

Please be advised that Enron is still holding a letter of credit No. 7403213
in the amount of $7,000,000.

This letter of credit was provided by Palladium Insurance as credit support
for transactions which Enron terminated.

We request that Enron immediately return the letter of credit by overnight
to Bank of America at the following address:

 Bank of America
Insurance Division

Chicago, Illinois  60697

Attn: Mr. James Horning

We would appreciate your confirmation of this action by return email or fax.

Yours sincerely,

Andy McComb
