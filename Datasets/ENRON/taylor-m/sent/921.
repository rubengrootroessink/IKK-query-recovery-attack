We had hoped to have an answer from local counsel in Japan by the end of last 
week.  Unfortunately we have not yet heard from them.  Alan Aronowitz has 
sent an e-mail asking for an update on their progress.  As soon as we have 
their answers to our questions, we will be able to prepare an ETA for 
counterparties trading from Japan.
