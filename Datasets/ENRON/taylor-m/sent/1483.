Nothing has changed - we are looking forward to having you work with us as

Mark:

I just wanted to check whether or not I was already fired before being hired 
as a result of this latest reorg?  

On a more serious note, I just wanted to confirm that the latest reorg did 
not change what we agreed yesterday.

Many thanks

FPL
