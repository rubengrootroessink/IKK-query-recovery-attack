We will need to catch a cab to get to La Fogata which is located at 2427 
Vance Jackson Road in San Antonio.  Our dinner reservations are for 7:00 pm, 
so I suggest we all meet in the hotel lobby at 6:30 and catch group cabs 
together.  Dress is casual.  The phone number for the restaurant is 
210-340-1337, in case you get lost in a wild cab ride or something similar 
(this will have special meaning to certain swap group members!).  If you 
haven't RSVP'd back to me, please do so, so I can get an accurate head count 
for tomorrow.

See you in San Antonio.
