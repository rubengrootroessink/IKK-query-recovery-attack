I'm following up with Cindy Skinner of ECT HR to try and get this resolved.  
Thanks for letting me know it was still an issue.

Mark,

I really have no idea what this is all about, but it seems to be spiralling a 
bit out of control.  I'm in NYC today, but could you call Ms Arteaga and sort 
this out?  Let me know if I need to do anything.

Thanks,
Randy

Brent Hendry  is no longer with ECT Legal.  He works with Scott Porter and 
Don Black, he is currently in  Buenos Aires, Argentina .
He should be in Co# 359 and RC# 0303.

Scott - Can you please confirm that Brent Hendry works for you.  Should we 
move him out of your RC ?

Thanks,
Rain

Rain,

Per the message below from Randy Young, Brent Hendry needs to be transferred 
to ECT since he doesn't belong to EI.  He is currently sitting in one of my 
rc's and needs to be moved to ECT's.  Can you please transfer him this pay 
period before EPC closes?  Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Karen

Brent works for ECT legal, not EI.  He reports to Mark Taylor, an AGC in ECT 
Legal.

Randy/ Scott:

I don't know if you remember or not, but last year I had a question as to who 
Brent would report to and who's budget it should hit.
He's now in Scott rc but he's a Sr. Counsel.  Shouldn't he be in Randy's rc? 
Please advise.

Thanks,
Karen
