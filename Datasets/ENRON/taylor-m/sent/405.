In order to complete the approved list of counterparties fo the new online 
trading system I need a list of master agreements you have negotiated that do 
not have all the necessary representations (e.g. trade option exemption) and 
definition references to permit trading energy commodity derivatives.  Friday 
noon would be soon enough.

Thanks,

Mark
