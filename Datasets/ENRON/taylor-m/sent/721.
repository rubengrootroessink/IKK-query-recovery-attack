   If any of you care to voice your opinion about Height Blvd. the best
   person to speak to is:
   Mignette Dorsey, City of Houston Bikeway Coordinator


   713-837-0003

   I spoke to her and found out that this has been planned since the
   early 90's (see how fast our government works).  She said that she
   has received several complaints but the project will continue until
   completion (they have to put down the bike symbols) before it would
   be reconsidered.  If you don't like the restriped Heights Blvd. I
   suggest you call Ms. Dorsey and email the following:

   Jeff King - Public Works


   wjohnson@pwe.ci.houston.tx.us

   Robert Litke - Planning & Development Dept
   rlitke@pd.ci.houston.tx.us

   Annise Parker - City Councilwoman
   aparker@cnl.ci.houston.tx.us



   Thanks!!


   Gordon Hagendorf
