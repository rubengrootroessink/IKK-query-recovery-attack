I spoke with Bill about this and he agreed it was a good idea.

Subject: ECT North America Executed Master Agreements

 Tanya   - Is it possible that Credit could include the restrictions listed 
on the Executed Master Agreement list (see current version in attachment 
below) on your department's  Credit Watch List?    In one of our group 
meetings, we were discussing this idea.   We thought it might more sense to 
include the information on an existing report, instead of creating another 
report.    Please let me know.
