Good catch.  NY law should apply throughout the Americas and in Japan.  We 
used UK law in Europe and Singapore on the theory the counterparties there 
would be more comfortable with Uk law.  I'm not sure which the Australians 
would prefer.  What do you think of the following:

16.  If you are accessing this website from North America, South America or 
Japan, the terms of this legal and Privacy statement shall be governed by the 
laws of the State of New York; if you are accessing this website from any 
other location, its terms shall be governed by English law.

Mark and Leslie:

On the Legal & Privacy Statement Page on the new website you have the 
following clause:

16.  If you are accessing this website from the U.S., the terms of this legal 
and Privacy statement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York: 
if you are accessing this website from outside the U.S., its terms shall be 
governed by English law.

Could you please let me know if this holds for countries such as Mexico and 
Japan?

Thanks for your help!
