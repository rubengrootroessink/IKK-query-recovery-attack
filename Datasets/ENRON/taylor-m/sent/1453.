Mark,
could you add a legal disclaimer to this draft term sheet that reflects the 
fact that we have not performed a credit check on the counterparty? Thanks. 
FYI, I am also going to prepare a draft term sheet for a physical transaction 
which I will ask Harry Collins to review.

Tammy,
After I sent this to you, I received a voice mail message from Mark Taylor 
requesting one more change. Mark pointed out that we need to say the first 
issue each month, and I  have now made the change. This version has been 
approved by legal.
