I think there should be a Master Swap Agreement in place between ECT and EI.  
I suggest you check in Lotus Notes but I'm pretty sure Lisa did one about a 
year ago.

Hi Heather,
There is no umbrella agreement between EI and ECT at present. We will need 
(i) an ISDA Master Agreement  and (ii) depending on the risk assessment of 
the transaction by ECT's Credit Group and the benefit allocation of such 
transaction, a risk allocation/assumption agreement, in each case, between 
the parties. I have left a message for Tanya Rohauer of the Credit Group and 
will keep you posted.

Yao
