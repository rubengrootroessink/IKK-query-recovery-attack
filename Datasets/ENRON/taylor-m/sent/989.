Subject: Windows 2000 Roll Out

Hi Ladies!

As you know, we are planning to roll out Windows 2000 in early May.  This 
will require upgrading our computer equipment with what is "necessary" to run 
Windows 2000, including new CPUs for most of us.  Although I haven't seen 
Windows 2000 yet, I am told that there are very few changes, the most 
significant one being that we will be using Lotus Notes for calendar 
purposes.  (Organizer goes away.)  We are told that with 1 hour of training 
everyone should be up to speed!

Could you please take a moment to answer the following questions? 

Do you or your assignments have a Palm Pilot? NO

Do you or your assignments have an "Enron" purchased computer at home? NO

Do you or your assignments have any personal software you have loaded? YES

Do you or your assignments save any files to your C: drive? YES

Do you or your assignments save any files to your H: drive? YES


I need this information as quickly as possible.  Also, please let me know if 
you are planning any vaction time during the month of May so we can start 
scheduling training.

THANKS FOR YOUR HELP!
