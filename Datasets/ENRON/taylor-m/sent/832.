I'm not sure which "process" you are referring to.  I have not yet seen a 
list of proposed reference entities and if any of them have a business 
relationship with Enron they will need to be subject to a deeper legal 
review.  The process for that review has not yet been finalized but for some 
potential reference entitiesit will be very time consuming (i.e. for those 
entities where the extent and nature of the business relationship is 
unclear).  The "soft" Chinese walls also have yet to be built for the US.  
For those walls to be effective there may need top be training for people on 
both sides of the walls.

Subject: Credit Launch

Credit are pushing to launch online credit trading for this coming Monday.

Have you both "signed off" on the process, or are there issues outstanding 
which need to be resolved, from your point of view?
