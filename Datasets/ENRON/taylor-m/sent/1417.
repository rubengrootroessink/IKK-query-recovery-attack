Thanks for the resume - I'm looking at a number of internal candidates from 
APACHI, CALME and Southern Cone but will keep this one on file (and pass it 
along - might be good for Richard Sanders).

This person saw you speak at PowerMart and wanted to see if we had any 
available positions within EnronOnline.  He emailed me his resume and  I am 
forwarding it on to you.  Don't know if you are interested, but thought I 
would send it.
