I'd like the Omnibus and the short form of master. Thanks!

It's not clear to me which form you want - we have (i) an "Annex A" which we 
use like a general terms and conditions to attach to a one-off confirm (i.e. 
where there is no master agreement in place) and is sometimes called the 
"Omnibus" (because it's a single form for any type of commodity derivative 
which replaced a multitude of separate forms) or (ii) a "Schedule" which is 
attached to the ISDA form agreement to make it our version of the ISDA master 
which can then have a collateral support annex attached.  Just to make it a 
little more complicated, we also have our own form of master agreement which 
we use with less sophisticated counterparties and where we need to translate 
the document into another language (which we don't want to do with the ISDA). 
 Just let me know which one you want & I'll have Tana e-mail it to you.  This 
stuff is all covered in Tana's short-course on ECT derivatives documentation 
- maybe you'd like to sit in on it when she comes over?

I flubbed in my last message. I don't want the deemed ISDA, I want the full 
form Annex A. Thanks!
