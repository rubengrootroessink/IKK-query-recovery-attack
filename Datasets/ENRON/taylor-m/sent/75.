Hey Mark - I thought you had my new (as of July 1997) address - sorry about 
that.  I'm now at:

1322 Rutland
Houston, TX 77008

(713)863-7190 - home
(713)853-7459 - work

I heard about Mrs. Boone in the Scots News.  I thought it was a nice 
write-up.  The Boones were very special people and I regret extremely that I 
didn't get to know them better.

Hope you guys are doing well.  I was in NYC in Nov. but was so busy I didn't 
have time for visits or fun of any kind!  Hope to get back soon but there's 
nothing for NY on the calendar.  Probably DC early Jan., London late Jan. and 
Buenos Aires and Sao Paolo in Feb.  I saw the magazine article (with such 
good photos!) a couple of months back.  My mom actually called to tell me 
about it.

Did you guys get my Christmas card?  I thought Celena might get a kick out of 
it.  Tell Debbie & Celena I said "Hi!" 

Take care,  Mark T.
