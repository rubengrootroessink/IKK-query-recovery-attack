I'm not sure what "penalites" they're referring to.  I assume it's a physical 
concept.   If we trade power with these guys I guess you would be the right 
person.  If it's gas, probably Stacy.

Was wanting more details on penalties for EnronOnline.  I was only able to 
refer him to Legal.

I had passed on your name and told Jim, either you or someone from our legal 
department would
follow up with him.

Thanks for your help!

Comments = I would like to see, in writing, the penalties associated with 
failure by Enron or the parties doing business on EOL for particular gas 
trading points.  I have heard verbally from the Calgary office what they 
consider the penalties to be, however, I haven't seen anything in writing.  I 
assume that unless parties have agreed to these stated penalies, the 
penalties would then fall under existing trade agreements.   Is this correct, 
and is Enron working on specific penalty provisions for EOL deals?
