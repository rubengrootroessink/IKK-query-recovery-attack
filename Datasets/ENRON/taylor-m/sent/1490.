Unfortunately I'm already booked for breakfast (which is unusual for me).  
I'm free for lunch though on both days if you are.

Mark-- 

Hudanish says he is at a closing in North Carolina next week. As I recall, 
you are in NY on Monday and Tuesday.? Any chance we could meet for breakfast 
on Tuesday?
