Hi Mary.  Barbara tells me there's a better-than-good chance you will be 
coming back to join the department.  Hooray!  I was hoping we could chat 
about how you would feel about joining the financial trading group this time 
around.  I'm leaving for the airport in just a bit to head out of town for 
the rest of the week but would be happy to talk when I get back and you 
should feel free to talk to Carol and Sara in the meantime.

Mark T.
