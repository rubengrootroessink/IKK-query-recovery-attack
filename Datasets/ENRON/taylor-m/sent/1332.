We were working on Brazil (Andrea Bertone in Sao Paolo was heading it up) but 
I think they have stopped for now.  I'll look for her latest e-mail and 
forward it to you.  The others are all new.  Tana can give you the form of 
local counsel survey we have been using if you want it.

Is anyone doing the legal work necessary to start conducting online trading 
in any of the following jurisdictions?  Clickpaper wants to add customers 
from these jurisdictions and it doesn't appear that EOL "goes there" yet:

Brazil
India
china
Turkey
Lebanon
Venezuela
