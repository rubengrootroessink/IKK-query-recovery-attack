Hi Nedre,

I have submitted my name previously to you for another position and I have
spoken to you over the phone.  Just to refresh, I am currently working for the
Commercial Information Group or the EnFile group and I am a Texas licensed
attorney.  I am interested in the Senior Legal Specialist position and I hope
you will keep my name in consideration.  Thanks.
