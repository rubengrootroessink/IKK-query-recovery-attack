Paul,

the counterparty to the Put is not ECT Europe Inc. but Enron Capital & Trade 
Resources Corp. This means any opinion about due incorporation and execution 
comes from Mark Haedicke and the opinion should therefore be included in Mark 
Taylor's bundle of docs for Mark or one of his team to present to Mark 
Haedicke.

Thanks.


     Mark

Mark, you will note we actually asked for the debt Put Company to be changed 
to ECTR Corp. a couple of weeks ago.

Can anybody tell me where this company fits in to the Enron group structure? 
Who are its shareholders and when was it incorporated. Is it definitely a 
Delaware Corp?

Can you please let me know asap.

Thanks



      Mark
