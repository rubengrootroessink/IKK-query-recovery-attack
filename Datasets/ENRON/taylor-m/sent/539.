We may have some problems with derivatives trading in Mexico - see Tana's 
note from earlier today.  I'll start the process for the ETA & PA.

Mark,

Looks like we will have some counterparties in Mexico who we would like to 
set up on the system.

Can you coordinate the preparation of the ETA and PA for Mexico?  (I assume 
it was you who looked after the US/CDN PA and ETA?)

Thanks,

Dave
