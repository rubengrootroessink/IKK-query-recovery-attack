Hi Jason,
Hope your work is going fine.  Mom and I are fine.
I hope you have your car & drivers license stuff fixed.
I was thinking (worrying) about that the other day, and it
dawned on me that if you got stopped again, they would probably
(may) take your drivers license. That wouldn't be too good with
you just starting a new job. Let me and mom know, we still worry
about you (and will till we're gone--so don't get in an uproar).
You will understand that when you have kids--natural instinct.
Mom and I are anxious to come see you in March, probably around
3d or 4th. We don't know if you can get a day off, or if you want
to even ask with your new job etc. But think about it and let us
know so we can plan our week off. If we can't see you more than the
weekend, we will leave Monday and do something ourselves on the way
back home. It's only a month away, so let us know what you'd like
or can do as soon as you can.  Thanks.  Say hi to Beth for us.
Dad
PS: Mom bought me the "Riding with the King" CD, so don't send it.
