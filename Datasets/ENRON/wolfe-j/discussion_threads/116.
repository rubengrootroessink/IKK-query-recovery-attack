hi jason,
got your message. i forwarded it on to natalie and  amanda. nate and tiffany 
are getting a new server and don't have a new address  yet. natalie didn't go 
to the show. it was in dallas. grandpa is having  angioplasty on thursday. 
i'm sure you'll hear from your mom, but i'll also email  when i get home from 
the hospital after he's all settled. he'll be in davenport  from thursday til 
saturday. love, aunt carol
