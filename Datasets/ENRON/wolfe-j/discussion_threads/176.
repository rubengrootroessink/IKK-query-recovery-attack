OK, so I don't know all of you and many others are long estranged.  And
there's nobody estranger than Brewster!  Hey-oohhh!  Yes!

Now that I have tickled your funny bone, I would like to tickle another
bone.  That bone is the one that is interested ushering our mutual friend,
Eric Ellwanger into blissful espousal.  We are throwing what the French
call "un party d' bachelor" for the bon bon homme.  (I do not speak French,
but I think that last bit rhymed.)

I really do not have a lot of information yet, I just wanted to make sure
that everyone keeps the date open.  The main event is Saturday,  May 12th
(a week before the actual wedding).  But, I think we oughta make a weekend,
and then a week of it, since at least Eric and Adam will be free for the
entire week between the bachelor party and the wedding.  It will take place
in Houston, but naturally will have global repercussions.  Out of towners
and drunkards, don't worry about a place to stay, I've got lots of room.

Oh, don't get too excited, but I might be able to get the KLF to perform.
They've got a hip new sound!

In the meantime, I would love to hear any ideas you might have for themes,
party favors, and the like.  Maybe something to do with the Cardinals,
Hawaiian shirts, or malted milk.   Also, if you have any pictures, please
send those along, as the hosts will possibly be developing a website to
chronicle this event.

Sincerely, Clay
