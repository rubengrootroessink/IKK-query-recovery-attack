Hey beotch,

The ski thing is on.  We are going to Lake Tahoe.  Arriving on Wed,
March 14th and leaving Sunday March 18th.  The closest airport is in Reno,
but some of the people are flying into Sacremento cuz it is cheaper.  We
have a house rented out and it sleeps 12.  I think it is going to be all
women with at the most 4 guys including you and me.  The women are mostly
single, wealthy, and looking for a noncommital, spring break type
relationship.  I think Nancy and I will be renting a car to drive to this
place from the airport.  Let me know if you want to hitch a ride with us.
