> Guess the warnings were true.  Federal Bill 602P 5-cents per E-mail

> The last few months have revealed an alarming trend in the Government

>   Bill 602P will permit the Federal Government to charge a 5-cent

> The consumer would then be billed in turn by the ISP.

> Washington DC lawyer Richard Stepp is working without pay to prevent

lost
> revenue, due to the proliferation of E-mail, is costing nearly

> Note that this would be money paid directly to the US Postal Service

> Congressional representative, Tony Schnell (R) has even suggested a
