Jason-

What is up?  My datebook says it is your birthday (I always write
yours and Tara's in at the same time 3/8 and 3/18...they are easy
to remember that way...random.)  Anyway, I have not had a chance
to shop, so I was thinking of making you some kleenex box shoes.
Sounds good right?

Stop by Matt's for a beer sometime...I have not seen you since
we played TP...I won right, jk.

Later,
Tami
