You asked for  it.? I've got lots of grandson pics.? :o)
Here are a  few.
I made the  one titled "who does he like" just to bug Cathy.....LOL.....
I told her  "Look who he's thinking about when Grammy is holding 
him".........I thought it  was funny.? 
But not  everyone did--I was in trouble for awhile
