It's time again for the annual party that I host with John and a few good 
friends.  Some of you have attended in the past.....it is best described as a 
college keg party...no frills...just cold beer, loud music, darts and lots of 
people.  It has included everything from salsa dancing, moon pies,  to 
individuals driving their vehicle through the yard to get out of their 
parking spot.  The police have never been called to quiet things down, but 
don't let that discourage you from coming.  If you can't attend...like I 
always say...there will be another next year.  Please forward this on to 
anyone you think would be interested....this party is by all means not an 
invitation only gig.  Here are the details:

Saturday, January 27th, 7th Annual IDHAFR Party 
6422 Wister Ln.  77008 (About 5 min from Memorial park, just across I10)
Directions Below:  (Call Mo:713-516-0651 or John: 832-724-7102  if you have 
trouble finding it)

Come anytime after 6PM (Excluding "Special" invitees!!!) 
Party often lasts till after 3am and peaks between 9:30-11.
There should be 2 or more kegs depending on how many people we expect...we 
floated the 2nd last year at around 10pm.
Bring anyone and everyone you want.....the more the merrier.
The later you come the farther you'll have to park
I recommend avoiding driveways and fire hydrants and be kind to the 
neighbors.
