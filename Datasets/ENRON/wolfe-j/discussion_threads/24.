Sounds good to me.  How's working for enron?  I'm tied up for the next week
or so, but how about a week from friday? (Feb 2)
Let me know, I can probably bring a couple of guys from work as well if we
need more players.
Speaking of players, have you heard from Alan?

Shannan,

How's everything going?
I was hoping to get an actual poker night together this year, so call or
email me when
you are in town. I've talked to Matt recently, and I assume Mike is still
living in Houston.
