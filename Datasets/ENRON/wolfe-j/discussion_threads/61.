Mr. Wolfe,

I just thought that I would let you know the final cost calculations
for the trip that the group has done.  After taking into account the place,
transportation, food, alcohol, skiing, rentals, and other essentials, it
looks like it is gonna run around 1245$/person.  Since you are now making
the big bucks and judging how badly you want to spend time with me, I see
this as an excellent bargain for you.  Let me know if you have any issues.
