Effective: We have a new system to prepare expense reports called:

Expense Reporting System:  XMS

In order for us (your assistants) to prepare your expense reports you will 
need
to log on the system and give us your permission.  I will provide you step by 
step
instructions to do so.  I will make it as easy as possible.  It is very 
important
that you do this otherwise we will not have access or permission.

(1)  LOGGING ON TO THE SYSTEM:
                Log on to xms.enron.com and enter your logon ID and password.
                 (Your log on ID is your P00 # or your NT ID and your 
password is ENRON)
(2)  SELECTING APPROVER AND ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT
                 Select MY INFO button-Then go to Concur Expense tab and 
select WORKFLOW.
                     Click on the spyglass to pick your approver (your 
manager) then your Administrative Asst.
                                          Be sure to SAVE YOUR SELECTION.
(3) CHANGING YOUR PASSWORD
                 Select MY INFO button-Then select MY PROFILE-Then CHANGE 
PASSWORD
                  (Type in your old password twice)  ( If you forget your 
password call 31411.)
(4)  CREATING AN EXPENSE REPORT (If you decide you would like to prepare your 
own expense report)
                 Select MY WORKSPACE tab, then CREATE EXPENSE REPORT.  Fill 
in required fields.
                Select next button
(5)   APPROVING A REPORT
             An email message will notify you of a report pending your 
approval.  You can click on the hotlink
             to logon to XMS system.  Approve at  summary level by clicking 
on the approval button for the 
             Home Page.  Or double click on the title of the expense report 
to preview the details.
