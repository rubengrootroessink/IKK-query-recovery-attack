Hey Jason,

How are you DaDragon?  I'm doing great.  I emailed you with this account
and datiger12@hotmail.com but your hotmail account kept rejecting my
accounts.  I think you put a block on them.  Anyway, that's great to hear
that you have a great job at Enron.  Is that in Houston right?  If it is,
maybe we can go out for a drink or something?  I know a few places to go
hehehe.

Stocks are bad right now so I don't mess around with them.  Don't assume
that these companies are at rock bottom simply because they are so
low.  They could go lower.  I would wait until things clear up.

Aight, I'll check with you later.  Nice to hear from you again.

Minh
