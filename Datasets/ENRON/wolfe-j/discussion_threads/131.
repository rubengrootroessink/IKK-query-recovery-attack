Thank you for choosing Ameritrade as your discount broker.  We have received 
your account funding.  You may now place trades with a broker on marginable 
securities.*  Please note:  Trades placed with a broker are subject to the 
regular broker-assisted commission rates.

When viewing your account balance online, your account will show a zero ($0) 
balance until funds are posted.  Please allow 2 business days for your funds 
to be made available for Internet or IVR telephone system trading.

If you need further assistance, or would like to place a trade with a broker, 
please contact us at 1-800-669-3900.  Thanks again for choosing Ameritrade.

Ameritrade.  It's how you get somewhere on Wall Street.

*Ameritrade places a 10-business-day hold on all deposits.  These funds 
cannot be withdrawn or used to purchase non-marginable securities (IPOs, 
stocks trading for less than $5, OTC Bulletin Board, etc.) or options during 
this period.

The 10-business-day holding period does not apply to funds wired into 
Ameritrade accounts.
