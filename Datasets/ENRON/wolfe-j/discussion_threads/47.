Chris Gaskill asked me to forward all of you basic gas reports.  

For those of you who have a natural gas background, most of the information 
may be basic.  For those of you who are unfamiliar, the below reading 
material should afford a good overview of where the  gas market has been, 
where it is headed and what the fundamental of the natural gas market are.  
If you have any questions, you can contact Chris Gaskill.  If you'd like more 
reading material, you can also let me know :)  If you have any questions 
regarding the group, feel free to contact me.  I will be in NY for the next 
two weeks but I can be reached via email or cell (713)628-8395.
