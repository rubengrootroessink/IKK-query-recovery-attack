hey jay!
I didn't end up going to texas for financil reasons. amanda and i did just
get back from colorado visiting some friends for spring break. it was a good
time. i'm moving to florida for an internship in may when classes are over.
i'll be living with nate and tiff. i'm really excited about that. then i
come back here in november and graduate and move into the real world. how's
your job going? classes are pretty easy this semester so i've been having
fun, but i have a big test tomorrow, so better get back to studying. love,
your beautiful cousin natalie
