Subject: mardi gras!


all,

welcom to the official invite of the guidroz brothers mardi gras bash to be
held by me and my little brother (yes there is another) at his house in the
most beautiful and decadent city in america, new orleans.

first of all let me tell you if you have made it on this list, you are very
special to me and therefore entitled to all and any hospitality in my home
town.  there is no such thing as imposition. SO...

MARDI GRAS: what the fuck is it??  well you have heard me talk of it, but
here is a quick overview with some helpful links.  mardi gras is officially
the biggest party in america.  it is the catholic celebration of fat tuesday
and ment to get all of your partying out of your system as you enter lent
(ash wednesday). here are some links for more information and you can also
email me with questions.

also for information about my wonderful city of new orleans

this year mardi gras day is on tuesday, feburary 27th. but this is just the
last and most decadent day, the grande finally so to speak.  the party
starts about 2 weeks before and gets more manic as fat tuesday approches. so
here are the date options.

my brothers house is open to us from tuesday the 14th of feburary until
friday the 3rd of march.  you will want to be there definately for either or
both weekends of the 16th-18th and the weekend of the 22ond-24th.  the later
being more hardcore partying than the first.  if you would like to visit the
city and surrounding area (ie. river road plantations, the swamps, the
cemetaries, etc.) and some of mardi gras you would want to plan for the
first week and weekend.  if your all about not remembering what the hell you
did, but had fun, the second weekend through fat tuesday would be your bag.
of course your welcom for the 2 weeks as well.

What we provide.  my brother and i have been doing this for several years
now.  it is his job to provide the house and my job to fill it up with the
most fun and interesting people i can, thats why you guys are on my list!
it can really get crazy downtown so my brother and i kind of act as tour
guides.  also, if enough of us come, we are going to plan a crawfish boil.
(yes eric, crawfish cajun style! none of that salty cold sweedish stuff) all
you have to do is:

email me when your flight gets in to New Orleans International airport and
either you can take a cab (real close to my bros house) or someone will meet
you there.

then just tag along with the group or do your own thing.  my brother has a 3
bedroom house a few couches so chances are everyone (including me) will be
crashing all over the place, so bring some sort of backpacker type gear
(sleeping bag and stuff).

ok then.  thats it.  ill be there from the 14th to the 28th, tenitavely,
will nail that down soon.  so as we say in new orleans, "lassiere la bon
temps roullete!"
