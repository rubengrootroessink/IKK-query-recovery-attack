  Jason,

   I am having trouble doing your expense report.  SAP is telling me to have 
a tech fix
   the problem but it is a big process and I am switching over to Windows 
2000 tomorrow
   so I hate to go through all of that when everything will be different 
tomorrow.  Do me a
   favor, go in to XMS and change my name to Alex Saldana.  That way she can 
do your
   report for me.  Try to do it today before we change systems.  Let me know 
when it is
   done.  Sorry for the inconvienience.

   Brandee
