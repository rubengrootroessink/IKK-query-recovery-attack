These aren't my top ten, but I thought them useful anyway.





SUBJECT:  ONLY TEN (10)??


Dear Ann Landers:

You recently printed a letter from a man in Rochester,
N.Y., with a list of "Ten Rules for Women." He said he was
sure the females in your reading audience would come up with
a similar list for men. Well, he was right. Here's my list,
which I hope you will print in the interest of fairness:

Ten Rules for Men

1. Pick up your own socks, underwear and dirty clothes.
Clean the bathroom sink when you are finished shaving. We are
not your maid.
2. When you go to the store, ask if we want anything. If you
are fixing yourself something to eat, ask if we would like
something, too.
3. When we tell you we are bothered by something, we don't
expect you to fix the problem. All we want you to do is
listen and be sympathetic.
4. We think you look great, even when you lose your hair.
Combing one side over the top is not an improvement. It looks
stupid, and we are embarrassed for you.
5. We cannot read your mind. If you are angry, tell us why.
Don't hide in front of the computer or TV and pout. When we
ask where you want to go for dinner, don't say, "I don't
care." It's childish.
6. If you need our help to buy a gift for your secretary or
set up a dinner for your mother, please don't ask us at the
last minute. We need time to do it right.
7. Look around the house and see what needs to be fixed, and
then, DO IT. We appreciate a man who takes care of his home.
Just stay away from our tweezers, kitchen appliances, cuticle
scissors and other personal items. Don't use them to cut
carpet or mix paint.
8. The way to our hearts is through consideration. Cook a
meal once in a while. Wash the dishes. Give the kids a bath.
Women love it when a man does these things without being
asked.
9. We know shopping is not your idea of a good time, but you
should know dinner in a sports bar is not our idea of a
romantic night out.
10.We like sex, too, but if we say we have a headache, it's
true. Don't get bent out of shape. Offer us an aspirin, and
tell us to get some rest. We might feel better later, and
your chances will be a lot better. -- Lynn in Philadelphia

Dear Lynn:

Your suggestions are A-Number-One-Super. You've covered
all the bases. If the males who read this follow your
instructions, they will be rewarded handsomely. Count on it.
