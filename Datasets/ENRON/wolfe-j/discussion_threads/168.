Greetings from AdvisorTeam,

You recently completed the Keirsey Temperament Sorter at
AdvisorTeam.com. Your complete, 10-page type report has been
stored for you and can be retrieved, for a limited time, at our
introductory price of $9.95.

We have added a new payment processing option, Planet Payment.
This new option enables more efficient credit card processing.
International users can now obtain their reports in real-time.
U.S. users will appreciate the improved design of the Planet
Payment interface.

To purchase your report:

1. Point your browser to http://www.advisorteam.com.
2. Login using the email and password that you used when taking
   the test.
3. Double click the lock icon next to the name of the test you
   want to purchase.
4. Select the Planet Payment button and proceed to the SECURE order
   form.
5. Your test will instantly be made available to you online;
   not via email.

We at AdvisorTeam appreciate your business as we continually
increase the accuracy of the Keirsey test, and find new uses for
the Keirsey theory.

AdvisorTeam
