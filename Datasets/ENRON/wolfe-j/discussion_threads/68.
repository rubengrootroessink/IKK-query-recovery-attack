> Thank you for your quick response to my inquiry about my custom ZOOM
> XC USA  running shoes.  Although I commend you for your
> prompt customer service, I disagree with the claim that my personal iD
> was  inappropriate slang.  After consulting Webster's Dictionary, I

> The word means: "a shop or factory in which workers are employed for

> detailed in your first email.

> Your web site advertises that the NIKE iD program is "about freedom
> to choose and freedom to express who you are."  I share Nike's love
> of freedom and personal expression.  The site also says that "If you
> want it done right...build it yourself."  I was thrilled to be able
> to build my own shoes, and my personal iD was offered as a small token
> of appreciation for the sweatshop workers poised to help me realize my
> vision.  I hope that you will value my freedom of expression
> and reconsider your decision to reject my order.

> Regarding the rules for personalization it also states on the NIKE iD

> further explains:  "While we honor most personal iDs, we cannot honor
> every one. Some may be (or contain) other's trademarks, or the names of
> certain   professional sports teams, athletes or celebrities that Nike
> does not have the right to use.  Others may contain material that we
> consider inappropriate or simply do not want to place on our products.
>
> Unfortunately, at times this obliges us to decline personal iDs that
> may otherwise seem unobjectionable.  In any event, we will let you
> know if we decline your personal iD, and we will offer you the chance
> to submit another."  With these rules in mind, we cannot accept
