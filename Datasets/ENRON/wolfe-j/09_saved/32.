Jason, 
The information you want is available in Northwest Passage. 
Log onto Northwest Passage. 
In Passage select the Noms button and then the Scheduling button, this will bring up a window that has the capacities, nominated and scheduled volumes.

For the throughput capacities, you will need to check Meter in the upper left portion of the window.  Input the dates and the if you leave the throughput point at 0, it will bring up all of the data for the time period selected.  

The select the File, Save As, and the data can be saved as text or Excel. 

Caution, if you select more that one month at a time, it may time out on you or bog down the system. 

If you don't have access to Northwest Passage or have any other questions, please let me know.

Is there an easy way to query the Williams NWPL database for capacity 
and sched volume information 
without doing it day-by-day through Citrix EBB? I am interested in last 
winter's daily information. 
Can you download this and send it as a text or excel file (or files)? 
What options do I have? 
Thanks.
