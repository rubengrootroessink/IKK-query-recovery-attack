Hmm...it seems that while I was being bashed against the Tree, I glimpsed the babe-in-arms, Matthew, suckling in the upper branches,
already crushed beneath the weight of Allan's horse army and his own consistent inability to muster anything
more advanced than trade carts loaded with angry sheep.
M - I would hate to drag you away from your Starbucks "couture pathetique", but the time has come to hang up your raincoat,
put on some pants, and tackle something bigger than a junior high bratling.

How appropriate.  The Byzantines died out when?  Won't Allan play?  Has even the master tired of beating your ragged ass against the tree of knowledge?  Maybe Trav would be willing to play you from home, sort of the way Beth plays you ALL OVER TOWN.  I on the other hand will be far too busy mincing around the River Oaks Starbuck's--it's poser night, and I really must be there; I have so many wealthy people and celebrities to thank for all their generous gifts over the many years.
But, I'll come up to the office and taunt you like only I know how if I can persuade John to do it, too.

Someone better show up to play foil to my Byzantine death machine. Are 
you 
a bunch of gutted sheep? 
Or Conquistadors? BTW, the weekends are for lawnmowing.

    I've known blankets with more staying power than Travis (when it 
comes 
   to AoE).  I too would rather mow Trav's yard than play with thou foul 
   fowl.  Kiss my Goth ass.  Unless I get out in time in which case I'll 
   call you.

   I would LOVE to play AoE but alas, since my yard has become a 
   forestation of redwoods and great sequioas I must go home and mow. 
   Happy Hunting,

people.
