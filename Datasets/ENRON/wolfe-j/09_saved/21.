Got it.

We will upload those gas daily curves and the index curves from egs-prod
to sitara.  We will copy yesterdays prices into today.

NOTE: I can't find any curves called NGI-SOBDR-PGE
	I assume it is a spelling error because the one
	we have is spelled NGI-SOBDR-PG&E

Question
	how long do you want to keep the prices in the database?
	because We can add a date column so that it will the prices
	everyday.

Highlighted curves are significant for the west.
The Index curves are listed at the bottom.

We are waiting.

I have not heard from you yet so I had picked out the gas dailu curves
from yesterday. Are these the curves you need? This project will take
take several man hours to finish so I need your confirmation ASAP so
that we can start working on it. Otherwise we will not be able to deliver
it to you on time.

select curve_cd, book_type_cd, curve_type_cd, ref_period_dt, curve_amt
 from egs_curves
where effective_dt = trunc(sysdate-1)
and curve_cd like 'GD%'
and book_type_cd = 'D'
and curve_type_cd = 'SP'
