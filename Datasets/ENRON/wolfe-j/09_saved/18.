Melba, 

I would like to re-phrase this slightly.  "Seller must communicate its election of the interconnect delivery point to Buyer by 10:15 Central Prevailing Time on the business day prior to the Effective Date (the "Election Deadline").  In the event that Seller does not communicate its election to Buyer by the Election Deadline, the interconnect delivery point shall be El Paso Natural Gas Pipeline at PG&E Topock."

Please note - I changed Central Standard Time to Central Prevailing Time to accomodate daylight savings time.

The traders want to add the phrase in BLUE to the following location.  Could we go ahead and do this?  Please let me know.
