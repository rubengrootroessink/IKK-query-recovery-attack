Mr. Wolfe:  I suspect you saw the definition of TTSL on our web site but I
repeat here:
http://opi/reports/ttsl/index.htm

TTSL is an estimate of the actual loading on the BPA transmission system,
based
on federal and non-federal generation within the BPA control area, and
interchange
and wheeling onto the system. It is unadjusted for temperature or streamflow
conditions. TTSL is a BPA billing determinant.

TTSL is primarily a billing determinant for us and is a rough estimate of
the total load placed on the BPA transmission system based on internal
generation and interchange coming into the system and wheeling going thru
the system.  It is not meant to be comparable or similar to any other load
figure of CAISO or anyone else. It is not part of any
load/resource/generation balance modeling with the BPA system.

Hope that helps...
Thanks for your interest in our operations information.

Is the total transmission load information on your website similar to
the load figures on the CA ISO site?
That is, do they represent total demand on the system, so that when
imports/exports are factored in,
can give a balance of NW generation?
