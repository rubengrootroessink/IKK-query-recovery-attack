Dear Jason Wolfe,  
You have selected an awesome vehicle but, unfortunately, it is in high demand and very short supply, particularly in that color. We are currently taking deposits of $500 to order your vehicle. Since we are the #1 dealership in the 5-state region, we receive about 20% of all inventory in the region. That means we get more vehicles than any other dealership, and can provide your vehicle in a more timely manner. Please call me if you have any questions or to get on the waiting list for delivery. I look forward to satisfying your car needs.  
Sincerely  
Joyce Mbiu
