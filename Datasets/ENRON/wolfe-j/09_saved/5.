This is a reminder of what to do on Friday....

   Arrive by 7:00... Travis will be getting to the track between 7:15 and
   7:30 so everyone needs to be in the room before he gets there.  You'll
   need to have $1 for parking.
   Check in at the Special Admissions Booth under Travis Cherry's Birthday
   Group
   Go up to the Horizon Clubhouse on the 4th floor.  We have the Horizon
   Suite reserved for our group.  Its all the way down the hall on the left
   overlooking the track
   My mom (Cassandra) will be there.  She will have your tip sheets,
   programs, and drink tickets (so don't buy any on your way in!)
   Appetizer type food will be served

Let me know if you have any questions!

We're going to have fun!
