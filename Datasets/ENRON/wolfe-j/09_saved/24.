Dear jason.wolfe@enron.com:

Congratulations on your winning bid for eBay item 1624983525, Star Wars CCG CORUSCANT Sealed Booster Box. Your seller, heartie, has informed eBay that your payment hasn't been received yet.

If you have already sent payment or intend to pay soon, please contact heartie at jrmudra@pacbell.net immediately. Simple misunderstandings are often resolved through direct communication.

** Do not reply to this email.  All you need to do is contact your seller.**

If you have been unsuccessful contacting the seller via email, you are welcome to contact them by phone if needed. eBay allows all members involved in a transaction to request each others' contact information, including phone numbers. This feature can be accessed through the following URL:

 http://cgi3.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?MemberSearchShow

You and your seller are encouraged to work things out in the next 10 days.  If this situation is resolved during this time, the matter is dropped and you do not need to take any further action.

If, however, your seller is still unsatisfied after this period, you may receive a Non-Paying Bidder (NPB) warning from eBay.  Once you obtain three warnings on your record your account will be suspended indefinitely.

For additional details about eBay's Non-Paying Bidder Policy go to:

Please note that eBay does not take the side of the buyer or seller -- understand that we are only trying to help you and your seller trade successfully.  Remember: Your seller is under no obligation to "hold" your item since much time has already passed.

Regards,

eBay Safeharbor Team
