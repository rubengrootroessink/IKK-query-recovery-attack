I am interested in Cascade's natural gas demand by broad customer class - such as residential, industrial, and electric
generation - over the past year. Also, if possible, a list of the larger generators or industrials that you serve. 

Could you direct me to the department or individual who could best assist me in this research?

Thanks,
