Marvin,

Attached is the list of points. I need the general location and/or zone.

What is the nature of the Southend Balancing point (603)? There is a Northend Balancing, but it
has no volume.
Is Elmore Delivery M/S (616) a residential load?
What is Florida River reciept (599)?

Thanks for your help.
