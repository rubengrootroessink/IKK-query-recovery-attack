Well, go find Glen Cook's The Black Company to start a less deep, but still entertaining, series.

I forgot to tell you how mad I was as I got into the book that I am reading. You wouldn't believe how much Goodkind has ripped off from Jordan. I actually got out of bed to check the publishing dates on the books. 80% of Jordan's work was published up to 4 years before Goodkind. 80% of his ideas are ripped off by Goodkind. You would think that I would be so disgusted that I would boycott Goodkind. Unfortunately, my irritation does not reach that far. It is like finishing up a bowl of BlueBell Ice Cream, wanting another but having no more Bluebell and so settling for the marshmallow imitation generic grocery brand - empty calories that are not nearly as satisfying. I am so weak...
Love,
