Ms. Ridinger:

I am an analyst studying industrial gas load in the northwestern United States
and am attempting to place a number of aluminum plants. I believe I have the
Northwest Pipeline DRN numbers for 3 of your 4 plants, but am not sure
which meter feeds your Ferndale, WA plant. Also, I would like to confirm the DRNs
for the other three.
If you, or someone you could refer me to, could provide this information I would 
greatly appreciate it.

Thanks,
Jason Wolfe
