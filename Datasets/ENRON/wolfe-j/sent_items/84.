the merger will be completed over the next 8-10 months, so who knows where I will
end up. I need to be where the trading is.
Beth and I are driving up for XMas. We're leaving Houston Thurs or Fri before, and will head back
for Houston the 26th. Let Sweetpea know.

I am corrected--thanks.  What do you think about Illinova??  Close to home,
lower cost of living, etc???  From what I understand they are just starting
to get into the energy marketing business.  They might like an ex-enron guy.
