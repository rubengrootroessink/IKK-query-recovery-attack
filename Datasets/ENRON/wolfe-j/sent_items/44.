The Index settles during bid week for the following month (last week of Sep for Oct) and is
published around this time. This curve is probably in the system as basis, code D, which is the
difference between the Index and NYMEX settle. This index is the Oct price curve (P) plus the Oct 
basis curve (D). Deals are +/- a few cents for 
The index (I) curve is next month's curve at what these differentials are trading at. It is not the actual
"index". It is what is added to the index for physical deals priced off index.
I know it is confusing.

I'm confused. The gas daily prices is ok.
Question on index curves. What index curves do you need?

	a. the curves from egs_curves that are inserted into the
	   database everyday because the prices are different everyday.
	   risk type code = 'I' and curve_type_cd = 'PR'.

	b. the curves from the pub posting that are inserted into
	    the database once a month. These are the settle price curves.
	    risk type code = 'D' and curve_type_cd = 'SP'

That's fine. The Index curves we are most concerned with (the current month), will be set in the next day
or so and will not change for the duration of the month. Next month's index curves can be loaded whenever.

Jason,

	The Gas Daily Curves are loaded into the system everyday at 6AM
	or something when they have problems, the curves are loaded at
	around 11AM. I can get these curves as soon as they get it.
	However, Index curves are loaded by GGREENA, CFRANK2, and CRABON
	at around 3PM or 4PM. I will not be able to get these curves.
	I can get Yesterdays Index curves.
