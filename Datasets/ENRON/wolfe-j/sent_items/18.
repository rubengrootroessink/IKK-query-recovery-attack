Patti, Stacey,

The new Las Vegas Pool product will bridge into sitara as -
Pipe: Kern River Gas Transmission
Zone: Las Vegas
Facility: UNA - Las Vegas

It is buyer's choice; the pool consists of -
Harry Allen (2-4015)
Apex (2-4002)
Blue Diamond (2-4016)
Pecos (2-4013)
Lone Mountain (2-4012)

Pecos and Lone Mountain do not seem to be options when manually booking
a deal in sitara. If they are not in the system they probably need to be set up.

The meters will be determined before 10:30 during scheduling. The deals will
bridge with the UNA - Las Vegas meter/facility.

Let me know what you think.
Thanks,
Jason
