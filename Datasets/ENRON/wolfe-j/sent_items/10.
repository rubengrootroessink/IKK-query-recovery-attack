   My Romantic Horoscope for Today: 
   The pieces of a two-piece puzzle just don't seem to want to fit 
   together. You've tried countless angles, jerry-riggings and creative 
   solutions, but you keep coming up short. Perhaps the answer, then, is to 
   work with the flaws between the pieces as well as the pieces themselves.
