Jay, 
If I do not get out of this city soon, I am going to jump off of a tall building.

If Beth OKs it I can do a strategy session. That last email from 
Devil-Pooch made me 
yearn for the sight of his blood soiling the field of battle. 
The key to Allan's wins (and I have given it some thought): 
1) Quick advancement. He doesn't attack early, I believe it is to build 
stone walls, 
        encompassing a larger area than is proportional for his team. 
And to seal us off. 
2) Large level of resources, enabling him to cue Paladins to build as 
his army is killed. 
        Thus he has a constant wave of attacks. He also builds resources 
until the point 
he decides to attack, then he kills all but maybe 20 villagers. His army 
is concentrated 
and huge. 
3) Build castles on conquered territory. 
If we wall a large area, build resource levels quickly, then attack as 
soon as we each have a 
40 man army, with additional soldiers cued. we will win. The use of 
trebuchets is imperative. 
We should have a total of 10 on our team. Towers kill. 
AND WE MUST NEVER SIT BACK AND LET HIM REBUILD. Whenever we hang out not 
attacking, 
it's over.
