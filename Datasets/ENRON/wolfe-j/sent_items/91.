Ack!! Trying to catch up here after several days of vacation.  Quite a 
meandering collection of emails.  You should get your tee shirts and why 
not go the whole 9 yards and get custom license plates... take pride in 
your losing streak!!  Unfortunately I don't think I can make the game 
tonight, but Thursday or Friday for an xbox demo would be cool.
