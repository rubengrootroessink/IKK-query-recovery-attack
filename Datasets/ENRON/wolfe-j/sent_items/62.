OK. 
We can try it. There should be four jars: 
Jay does good. 
Beth does good. 
Jay is bad. 
Beth is bad. 
We will get the jars tonight. I applied for jobs today. They were not in Texas.

I know it seems gimmicky- but we sould keep a jar, and every time you get 
mad, I could put 
a penny in it, and you can decide every day if I have treated you like 
enough of a princess to 
take one out. Whatever is left after a month or so, we would take a getaway 
of however many 
pennies are in the jar (not funded by the pennies, of course). This would 
really show how much 
things have not gone your way, and would be a reminder for me. 
We could also set up a Jay jar, but I guess that would be less full. 
I am brainstorming to try to get myself to behave, so I know it's corny.

Also, I like the VIrginias and Carolinas, but we should go together when we 
go. 
And I think of you as my partner every day, and I'm sorry I take it for 
granted.

   I have an overwhelming need to leave. I am highly frustrated, but you 
   don't seem to listen. I am tired. I need to do something about the 
   situation, because it is NOT improving. I am tired of bitching, 
   complaining, criticizing, being hurt, and most of all not being taken 
   care of. You do not treat me like a friend half the time, much less a 
   partner. I really think that I need to go where I am going to stay and 
   establish my adult life. I think that the Virginias or Carolinas would 
   be a nice place, because of the climate, location, schools, etc. I would 
   like to go there, establish residency, and maybe go to school. 
   Otherwise, I would just like to leave, by a house, and build a little 
   bit of security. 
   I need something. 
   I need to stop fighting with you and do something with my life.

   I love you and although I am seemingly incorrigible, I listen to your 
   criticisms. 
   By now you should know that you can trust me through thick and thin. 
   Besides, you told Josh 2 weeks ago that you liked being with me, despite 
   our stubborn differences. I listened to you then also. 
   Let's get real, over the long haul, we have too much in the way of 
   common 
   interests, beliefs, and interesting times. I think we should just invoke 
   a 
   pact 
   to talk more without getting angry. We are not moving yet. When we leave 
   Houston, we are leaving together, so unpack your UHaul. 
   Love, 
   Jason 
   P.S. Also, I expect you to do some holiday visiting with me, 
   and vice versa.
