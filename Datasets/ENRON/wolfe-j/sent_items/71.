Jason, did you get a chance to talk to Geof Storey about using the Flexible Deal Viewer? If you want us to install it and let you give it a try give Ahmad a call at 5-4770 and we can come up and install it on your PC.

Jay,
We can come to your desk too if our location is not good.

Business Requirement: Realtime Deal Positioning for Wesk Desk Traders.

We want to see if your group has any solutions that may help traders who are looking into realtime deal positioning for a specific location by counterparty or start&end deal dates.

Thanks,
Franky
