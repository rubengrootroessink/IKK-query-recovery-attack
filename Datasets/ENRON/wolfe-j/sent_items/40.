Sergei,
To avoid duplicates I would prefer to pay for only the 18 Big Stalin Russian Political 
Posters (1013259638).
Thank you very much for your understanding. I am transferring funds to Paypal now in the 
amount of:
$16.50 (item) + $27.50 (shipping) = $44.00 (total)

In 3-4 business days a Paypal transfer will be made to ezyroll@aol.com.

Is this shipping from overseas? If so, perhaps this should be insured. Let me know.
My address is:

JASON WOLFE
2300 W ALABAMA  APT 6
HOUSTON, TX 77098

Thanks,
Jason
