   I'm playing.  I will be in the office at 5:30 for a quick meeting, 
but I 
   will join you after that.

      Ack!! Trying to catch up here after several days of vacation. 
Quite 
   a 
      meandering collection of emails.  You should get your tee shirts 
and 
   why 
      not go the whole 9 yards and get custom license plates... take 
pride 
   in 
      your losing streak!!  Unfortunately I don't think I can make the 
game 
      tonight, but Thursday or Friday for an xbox demo would be cool.
