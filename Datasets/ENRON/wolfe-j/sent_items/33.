So Tara is definitely returning?

Is this job the new boating equivalent of your UH recruiting job? 
Where you will clean less boats this year than anyone else in
your position in the history of Triumph Boats?

BTW, I have paid much more than $185 for a raw, water washdown, man-whore.

By Dec. 1 or Dec. 31, I forget. Her start date is Aug. 5th. I could give you
a raw water washdown, but I'd have to charge you $185.

So when does Tara have to commit to Big E?

Can you clean my boat? It has this crusty, fishy stuff on the bottom of the
hull.

   No dillweed. Just building them. Tara got her offer from Enron. It's
   pretty
   nice. Are you still working 547 hours per week?

   Cards win indeed. I like them for the series.
   Are you cleaning fishing boats, too?

      Hey there cheese dick. How's life in H-Town? This is my new work
   e-mail.
      I'm
      doing accounting work at this boat manufacturer. If you're in the
   market
      for
      a nice fishing boat you let me know. Capron filled me in on your
   quest
      for a
      Vegas trip. Doesn't look good. Due to my recent bout of unemployment,
   I
      don't think gambling would be a good use of my available fundage.
   Tara
      and I
      will be in Houston Nov. 15th thru 18th for Curry's wedding. Plan on
      throwing
      back a few that weekend when we get some spare time. Are you and Beth
      together or apart at this time? I really could just flip a coin and
   get
      as
      accurate an answer as you would give me, huh? Take it easy hombre. Go
      Cards!

      --Eric
