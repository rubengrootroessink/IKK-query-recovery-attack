So Camas Jr is confirmed paper mill?
Do you know what is behind the Bellingham II point (290)?
Bellingham/Ferndale (472) I understand is the Ferndale power plant; is this 290 point
another unit?
Thanks,
Jason

Dave,

What do you know about the NWPL meter 300 (Camas Jr.)? It makes up a fair amount of Portland area load.
It's my understanding that this is industrial, possibly paper mills, but I don't have much more info yet.
If this is a customer you are familiar with, let me know.

Thanks,
Jason
