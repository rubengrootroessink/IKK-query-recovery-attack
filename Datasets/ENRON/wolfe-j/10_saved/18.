Jason, 
What kind of attitude is that, you should always be will to party with friends.  We will set another day just in case but getting a lot of folks together at one time is a challenge.
How are things at Enron?  You going to be okay?

If I never showed up when you were there, I'm sure not going to start 
showing up on the days you are out. 
Let me know if it's on for next week when you are back.

   The original plan was to try and meet this week but the response has 
   been light.  From the few that did respond (which I thank for the 
   feedback) the consensus was to try and meet on Thursday but no location 
   was picked.  I will unfortunately be out of town this Thursday and 
   Friday on business.  If you guys still want to get together use the 
   Reply to All and set up a time and place.  It has been a long time since 
   most of us have tossed back a few brewskies together so don't let my 
   absents stop you (as if it really would).  I think my ego can take it, 
   may be not my id but my ego can.

   P.S.  I had asked Rex to send out a notice but I did not receive a copy 
   so I don't know if he had done so.  If you did Rex thanks, if you 
   didn't....we need to talk about your memory loss.
