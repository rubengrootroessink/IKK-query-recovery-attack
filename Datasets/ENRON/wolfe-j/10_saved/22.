   Word of the Day for Monday October 22, 2001: 
   popinjay \POP-in-jay\, noun: 
   A vain and talkative person. 
     One  popinjay  shrieking from the left and another from the 
     right  about  last  week's  headlines  is  not the whole of 
     Washington's   political   dramas.  Occasionally,  American 
     politics is more complicated and more momentous. 
     --R.  Emmett  Tyrrell,  Jr., "Feds Go Drug Crazy," American 
     Spectator, May 26, 2000 
     A  writer  who  appreciates  the  seriousness of writing so 
     little that he is anxious to make people see he is formally 
     educated, cultured or well-bred is merely a popinjay. 
     --Ernest Hemingway, [1]Death in the Afternoon 
     The  dignified, high density of personality of [Clark Gable 
     and   Humphrey  Bogart]  is  completely  missing  from  our 
     popinjay contemporary actors. 
     --Camille Paglia, [2]Salon, March 1998 
     _________________________________________________________ 
   Popinjay  is  from  Middle  English papejay, popingay, meaning 
   "parrot,"  from  Old  French papegai, deriving ultimately from 
   Arabic babagha.
