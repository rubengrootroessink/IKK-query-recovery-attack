Jason, 
Attached is the list of points with location information.  
Also, in response to your other questions, Florida River is BP's gas processing plant in La Plata County, CO.  Elmore is a power generation plant (Idaho Power) and Southend balancing is a logical point for NWP use.  
Let me know if you need additional information. 
Thanks, 
Wes Kida
