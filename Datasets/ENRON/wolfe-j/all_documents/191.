Dear Jason Wolfe,

This letter is to inform you of some NETeller updates:

Secure ID Added

As an added feature and to ensure your security, the design team at 
NETeller.com has instituted the NETeller Secure ID feature into its signup 
process.  The Secure ID will provide an additional layer of security to all 
NETeller.com members and will ensure that no one other than the authorized 
account holders can have access to their NETeller.com accounts.

How it works

All NETeller.com account holders will be emailed a 5 or 6 digit Secure ID.  
This Secure ID will be unique to each individual NETeller.com account holder.

Your new Secure ID is: 885892

The Secure ID will be changed and updated approximately every 4 months and 
this change will be emailed to all account holders at that time.

Upon successfully entering the users Account ID and Password, each user will 
be prompted for their Secure ID code.  By entering the Secure ID, users will 
gain access to their account page.  If you forget or lose your Secure ID code 
you may contact our customer service department at 888 258 5859 to retrieve 
it. 

NOTE REGARDING PASSWORDS

You will NEVER be asked to reveal your NETeller.com password by a 
NETeller.com representitive.
You should NEVER give your password out to any unauthorized user.
Passwords should be changed regularly and often.

Thank you

The NETeller.com Development Team
