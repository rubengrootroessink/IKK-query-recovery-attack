You need:

a gortex coat certified to -40 degrees
a black ski-mask
pantyhose in a dark color
sleeping bag
sombrero
sunglasses or ski-goggles
tights with matching tutu
long underwear (both upper and lower portion)
clogs for those rockin' and rollin' swedish parties
Ski gloves and maybe another set of goof around gloves.
Swim suit cuz our place has a hot tub.
warm hat like they wore in the movie 'Fargo'
And plenty of protection if you know what I mean.

I think this is a pretty comprehensive list.  Let me know if you have any
questions.
