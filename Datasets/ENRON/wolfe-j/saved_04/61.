Hi folks.  I'm not as witty as Clay, and I know even less French, so I'll
get straight to the point.  Bachelor party plans are well underway, but a)
we need an idea of how many people we're working with, and b) we need your
suggestions on the best way to celebrate Eric's last few days of being his
own man.  (Okay, those were back in 1996 or so, but it's a symbolism thing.)

To facilitate this, Kiernan has erected (hee hee) a website dedicated to the
May 12 party.  Go to www.burrosale.com, and click on the picture most
representative of the dates Eric went on before Tara.  If you choose
correctly, you will be able to read updates and post on a message board.
The message board is to be used to discuss the party and embarrass Eric in
any way you find appropriate.

If you haven't already please RSVP by e-mail to me, or call at 512.297.8085
or for a local call, Clay at 713.662.3789.  In order to defray costs, there
will be a "suggested donation" of $25.  Spots in the limo will be assigned
on a first-come first-serve basis to those that pay.  I hate to do that, but
the poor starving law student best man isn't eating only Wolf Chili and
Ramen noodles because he likes that pork flavor.

Anyhow, check the site frequently for updates, enjoy the board, and spread
the word to those I don't know that would be interested.

adam f.
