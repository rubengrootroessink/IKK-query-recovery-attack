Jason-

Beth and I went to dinner and a movie, very traditional, on Friday.  It
was good fun...have not seen a chick flick in a long time.

Are you asking me if Matt can come out and play on Friday?  Yes, I think
so...if he does not have to be in McAllen for work.  He has been going there
a lot lately to check up on the drilling for work.  I will tell Matt that
you are trying to get a game together.

Kleenex box shoes...if you keep reminding me, I may actually make them, so
mind what you say.

How is work, are they still shamelessly profitting from you hard core
work ethic?

Later,
Tamara
