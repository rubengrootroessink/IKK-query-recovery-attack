  [IMAGE]  Welcome back to eJoin Finance News, where there's always time to=
 get in on a hot property and always time to bail when that "sure thing" he=
ads south.   In this issue?  Collection Agency Harassment Junior Investors:=
 UGMAs Index Funds: An overview  Very few things make me happier than recei=
ving your email (My therapist says I'm making great progress though!). Plea=
se send any finance-related material, questions or stories to editor@ejoin.=
com [IMAGE]       The statements contained in this newsletter that are not =
historical facts are forward-looking statements that involve risks and unce=
rtainties.  You should consult with a certified financial advisor prior to =
making investment decisions.           [IMAGE]             Collection Agenc=
y Harassment and What to do About it.       If you've lived long enough, th=
en the chances are pretty good that you've had at least one run-in with a c=
ollection agency. Chances are even better that it was a thoroughly unenjoya=
ble experience.   Whether your debt is the result of investments gone south=
, unexpected medical expenses or a struggling home business, you still have=
 a ton of rights as a citizen of this great nation. One of those is the rig=
ht to not be harassed by collection agencies.  But how can you tell the dif=
ference between aggressive collection tactics and outright harassment? If t=
he collector is engaging in any of the following activities, then you may w=
ell be looking at harassment:  Debt collectors may not harass, oppress, or =
abuse anyone. For example, debt collectors may not:   use threats of violen=
ce or harm against the person, property, or reputation publish a list of co=
nsumers who refuse to pay their debts (except to a credit bureau) use obsce=
ne or profane language repeatedly use the telephone to annoy someone teleph=
one people without identifying themselves advertise your debt  Debt collect=
ors may not use any false statements when collecting a debt. For example, d=
ebt collectors may not:  falsely imply that they are attorneys or governmen=
t representatives falsely imply that you have committed a crime falsely rep=
resent that they operate or work for a credit bureau misrepresent the amoun=
t of your debt misrepresent the involvement of an attorney in collecting a =
debt indicate that papers being sent to you are legal forms when they are n=
ot indicate that papers being sent to you are not legal forms when they are=
  Debt collectors also may not state that:  you will be arrested if you do =
not pay your debt they will seize, garnish, attach, or sell your property o=
r wages, unless the collection agency or creditor intends to do so, and it =
is legal to do so actions, such as a lawsuit, will be taken against you, wh=
ich legally may not be taken, or which they do not intend to take  Debt col=
lectors are also not allowed to:  give false credit information about you t=
o anyone send you anything that looks like an official document from a cour=
t or government agency when it is not use a false name  Debt collectors may=
 not engage in unfair practices when they try to collect a debt. For exampl=
e, collectors may not:  collect any amount greater than your debt, unless a=
llowed by law deposit a post-dated check prematurely make you accept collec=
t calls or pay for telegrams take or threaten to take your property unless =
this can be done legally contact you by postcard  If you are being harassed=
 by a collection agency, the normal reaction by most people is to either av=
oid the calls, or get angry with the collector. While getting angry with th=
e harassing party might give you a brief moment of satisfaction, there are =
more productive ways to go about ridding yourself of that harassment.   Tel=
l them to stop  Under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), you h=
ave the right to tell a collection agency employee to stop contacting you. =
Simply send a letter (registered mail) stating that you want the collection=
 agency to cease all communications with you. All agency employees are then=
 prohibited from contacting you, except to tell you that collection efforts=
 have ended or that the collection agency or original creditor may sue you.=
 You can do this even if the collector is not breaking the law.   Document =
the harassment  If a debt collector breaks the law, document the violation =
as soon as it happens. Start a log -- and write down what happened, when it=
 happened and who witnessed it. Then, try to have another person present (o=
r on the phone) during all future communications with the collector. In som=
e states, you can record phone conversations without the debt collector's k=
nowledge. But beware. In a few states this is illegal unless you get permis=
sion from the collector or warn him that you are recording the call. Check =
with your state consumer protection agency to find out if you live in one o=
f these states.   File a Complaint  File an official complaint with the Fed=
eral Trade Commission (FTC), the federal agency that oversees collection ag=
encies. Ask the FTC to send you a complaint form, or just write a letter. C=
ontact the Federal Trade Commission at:   6th and Pennsylvania Ave. NW, Was=
hington, DC 20580  Or visit their website: http://www.ftc.gov/ftc/complaint=
.htm  Include the collection agency's name and address, the name of the col=
lector, the dates and times of the conversations, and the names of any witn=
esses. Attach copies of all offending materials you received and a copy of =
any tape you made. Also, send a copy of your complaint to the state agency =
that regulates collection agencies for the state where the agency is locate=
d. To find the agency, call information in that state's capital city. Final=
ly, send a copy to the original creditor and the collection agency. The ori=
ginal creditor may be concerned about its own liability and offer to cancel=
 the debt.  Once your complaint is filed, don't expect immediate results. T=
he FTC may take steps to sanction the agency if it has other complaints on =
record. The state agency may move more quickly to sue the collection agency=
 or shut it down for certain violations. Your best hope is that the credito=
r will offer to cancel the debt.       Junior Investors: UGMA's     This in=
vesting stuff is so easy; a kid could do it!  ?and probably should.  If tim=
e is the most important factor in an investment program, than it's impossib=
le to be too young to be an investor. Indeed, you should start an investmen=
t program as early as possible.   Starting an investment program is easy, r=
egardless if you are a young adult (18 years or older) or a youngster. Once=
 you reach the age of majority (18 in most states), you may have an investm=
ent account registered solely in your name. [IMAGE]  Youngsters under the a=
ge of 18 are not permitted to have their own investment accounts. However, =
several ways exist to introduce youngsters to investing.   When establishin=
g investment accounts for youngsters, consider carefully how you want the a=
ccount registered. If you choose to have the account in your own name, you =
will be responsible for taxes on the account. The good thing is that you al=
so retain complete control over the account for as long as you want.  An al=
ternative is to set up the account as a Uniform Gift To Minors Account (UGM=
A). Funds in the account are in the minor's name and social security number=
 and are considered to be owned by the minor. Dividends paid on the account=
 are taxable, most likely at a preferred tax rate. The adult custodian is r=
esponsible for the account until the minor reaches the age of majority. Any=
 withdrawals from the account are payable to the custodian on the minor's b=
ehalf until that time. However, once the youth has reached the age of major=
ity, which is 18 in most states, control of the account reverts to the chil=
d to do with as he or she sees fit. This is the downside of setting up a UG=
MA. Parental control is lost at the age of majority.  Another consideration=
 is that college financial aid decisions could be impacted if a child has s=
izable assets in a UGMA.  For these reasons, it is important to understand =
the pros and cons of UGMAs before registering the investments in that manne=
r.  There really is no right or wrong way to set up an investment account f=
or a child. What may work for a friend may not work for you. For that reaso=
n, make sure you set up the account in the way that meets your, and your ch=
ild's, objectives.             [IMAGE]           Index Funds: An overview  =
  If you are new to the wild and wooly world of investing, then you are pro=
bably a bit overwhelmed by the number of different "types" of investments. =
From stocks to bonds, mutual funds and IRAs, it seems like you need a bache=
lor's degree in finance just to understand your options. In this article, w=
e'll introduce you to Index Funds and explain why this might be an investme=
nt alternative worth looking into.   Unlike a typical mutual fund, index fu=
nds do not actively trade stocks throughout the year. This makes it an obvi=
ous choice for the investor that doesn't want to monitor the fund on a dail=
y basis. Rather, the funds hold their stocks for the full year and even lon=
ger if the index incurs few changes. This helps to cut costs by reducing tr=
ansaction fees and eliminating the need for highly paid fund managers.  The=
re are a number of sound reasons why index funds are so popular with invest=
ors. A few of those are:  No Sales Charges. No Manager Risk. Less Volatilit=
y. Less Operating Costs. More Diversification. Less Capital Gains Tax. High=
er Gross Returns for Both Bonds and Stocks. Even Higher Net Returns.  Not a=
ll indexes are created in the same way, though. How they are assembled can =
affect investor returns. Three methods primarily used to construct indexes =
are:  Market value-weighted Method- Each stock is given a weighting proport=
ional to its market capitalization  Price Weighted Method- Each stock is gi=
ven a weighting proportional to its market price  Equal Weighted Method- Ea=
ch stock is equally weighted in the index   The market value-weighted metho=
d, where a company worth $2 Billion is given twice the weight of a company =
worth $1 Billion, is the most popular way of creating an index. A market va=
lue-weighted index allows investors to best capture total economic activity=
 and changes in valuation of the companies in the index. By giving larger c=
ompanies higher weighting, this method reflects the fact that large compani=
es have larger revenues and profits and that any change will have a larger =
effect on economic activity than change in smaller companies.   A price-wei=
ghted index over-weights the performance of companies with higher listed st=
ock prices. Early in this century, high prices were synonymous with larger =
companies and higher market caps. Things are different today but the old me=
thod is still used for computing the index.  An equally-weighted index make=
s no distinction between large and small companies, both of which are given=
 equal weighting. The good performance of large-cap stocks is negated one-f=
or-one by poor performance of smaller-cap stocks in this index. Since there=
 are many more small companies than large ones, this strategy greatly overe=
mphasizes the importance of small company activity.  Despite the fact that =
index funds tend to be much lower risk than other investment options, you s=
hould still speak with a financial advisor prior to making the purchase. He=
 might be able to point out an index fund or two that have a higher yield p=
otential.  And that is always a good thing!    Submit a story              =
