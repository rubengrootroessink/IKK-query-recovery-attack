If your job is not going well read this:  Nickolas Hall, expert in 
psychobiology gives an example of coping skills for job stress:  When 
you 
have an "I hate my job day" try this:  On your way home from work, stop 
at 
your pharmacy and go to the thermometer section. You will need to 
purchase 
a 
rectal thermometer 
made by Q-Tip. Be very sure that you get this brand. When you get home, 
lock 
your doors, draw the drapes and disconnect the phone so you will not be 
disturbed during your therapy. Change to very comfortable clothing, such 
as a 
sweat suit and lie down on your bed. Open the package and remove  the 
thermometer.  Carefully place it on the bedside table so that it will 
not 
become chipped or broken. Take out the written material that accompanies 
the 
thermometer and read it. You will notice that in small print there is a 
statement: 
Every rectal thermometer made by Q-tip is personally tested. Now, close 
your 
eyes and repeat out loud five times, "I am so glad I  do  not work in 
quality 
control at the Q-tip Company."  See...your job isn't really that bad 
after 
all...
