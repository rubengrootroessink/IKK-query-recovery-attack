Do  you want to Accept Credit Cards
for your Online business or store front?

What is A Merchant Account?
- A merchant account is what you need to be able to accept
credit cards for sales or services.

Why do I need a Merchant account?
- Being able to accept credit cards for purchases make it much
easier and faster for your long distance customers.

Do I need to have an established store to get a merchant account?
-  No. It does not mater what you sell, at auction or on your
web site or even in your store front. we offer different account
to suite your personal needs.

What are your fee's?
-  Just like every person is unique, every account we sell is
unique to you and your business, therefore we can not state a
price until we know more about the account you need.<br>

How Do I get a merchant account?
-  All you need to do to get a merchant account is fill out the
form bellow and one of your reps. will call you with more information or get you started.

Can I call you instead?
-  We have in the past given a number to call for more information and to sign up, but the number of calls we where getting was too large and our customers where complaining about being on hold too long or not getting through at all. Therefore we now have a structure system of sales reps calling each and every customer in order of there submission to help them out.  We have found this system much more productive and less chaotic.


    I hope I have answered all your questions about Merchant Accounts and how to get one,  but if I have not please fill out the application, one of our sales reps will answer any other questions you may have
