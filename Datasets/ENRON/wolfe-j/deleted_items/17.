Greetings from Citibank Bill Manager,

We recently emailed you regarding new service levels that would be available
for your selection on June 1, 2001 for Citibank Bill Manager. However, due
to additional improvements we are making to the Citibank Bill Manager site,
these new service levels will now be available beginning June 7, 2001.
We apologize for this delay.

When you visit Citibank Bill Manager for the first time on or after June 7,
2001, you will be asked to select one of the three available service levels.
***** If you do not select a service level by June 30, 2001, you will
automatically be placed in the Premium Plan. *****

Please keep in mind that the service level you select is effective for your
billing activity in the month of June and billing for your new service level
will begin with your July statement.

If you select the Premium or Standard Plan, your account will reflect the
features of the new service level the next time you visit Citibank Bill Manager.
You may change your service level at any time by going to the Profile section
within Citibank Bill Manager. Changing your service level to the Free Plan
within the Profile Section will be available later this month.  If you choose
to change your service level within the Profile section, billing for the new
service level will be effective immediately.*

If you select the Free Plan, you must remove all non-AT&T Universal Card and
Citi Card billers and bills from your account before you can complete the
change in your service level. Your account will reflect the features of the
Free Plan later this month.

If you have any questions about the new service levels, please do not hesitate
to contact us at support@billmanager.accountonline.com or call 1-888-489-8653
between 8am and midnight ET, 7 days a week.

Sincerely,

Citibank Bill Manager Subscriber Services


* Customers who change their service level within the Profile section during
the month of June may see the new service level reflected on their June bill.
