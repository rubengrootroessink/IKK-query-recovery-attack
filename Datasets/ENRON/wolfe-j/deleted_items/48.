Are these dates still ok with you?
 
We are going camping July 19, 20, 21 and coming home on the 22.  We  are going to Austin Lone Star RV Campgrounds.  Johnye Leigh, Steve,   Vickye, Billy, Granny, Morgan, and PaPaw are going.  I would love it  if the four of you could go with us, also.  Granny wants to ride a train on  Saturday.  I got a two room cabin that we can all stay in.  Just bring  sleeping bags if you have any!!!  It will be fun.  They have a  swimming pool and jacuzzi.  We changed the date a week up, because Morgan  couldn't go it we didn't.  We have gone to New Braunfels the fourth weekend  of July for 10 years.  Mark purposely planned his trip the fourth weekend,  so Morgan couldn't go with us!!!  So we moved our trip up a week, so she  can still go!!!
 
Let me know,
 
Love Mom
