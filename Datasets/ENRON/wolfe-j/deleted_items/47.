I told Trav that we  would go over and play games with him last night, and I forgot about it ---  ooops. Anyway, Jonda is driving down from Pasadena tonight and wants to play. I  have to go, but I would like you to go to if you don't feel too tired. If you  want to get some rest though, I understand. Love you!  ---b.
