Dear Jason Wolfe, 
It has been a while since we spoke about your driving needs. Our inventory has changed since then and I realize your needs may have changed as well.
We can still have the vehicle you originally were interested in within 24 hours and we also have some that are similar with similar equipment, only less expensive. Toyota has special financing rates available on Corollas, Tundras, 4Runners and 2001 Siennas. We have great deals on 2002 Camrys.
If youd like to revisit our inventory, please click here www.smccalltoyota.com 
I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Regards, 
Joyce Mbiu
