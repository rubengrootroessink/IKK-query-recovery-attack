Yes Becky, that is SO pre-XBox. 
I would play, but I'm already spoken for every night this week.  Thanksgiving and shit... 
PS. If Jay is an haute dog, is he a beef frank (doubtful) or one of those fru-fru chicken-weenies?

Am I the only one sharpening my lance for some AoE this week, or is that 
SO 
pre-XBox? 
PS: Look at ENE -- the end of an empire

   Dearest Trav, 
   Saturday night was really special.  I've never had a five-way before, 
   and it was surprisingly comfortable.  Thanks for setting up that TV 
for 
   me to watch next to where the real action was going on.  Most guys 
   wouldn't have done that for me.  You're a wonderful guy, and I'll be 
   sure to invite you to all my upcoming multipartner fests. 
   Still sore, 
   Matt 
   PS. Please pass on my thanks and accolades to you're gorgeous 
   bikini-clad girlie and that hot dog.
