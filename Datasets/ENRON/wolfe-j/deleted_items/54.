Are you kidding?  I go to the opening of an envelope. Of course I'll be 
there.

 Dear Beth and Allan,  I've really missed playing AoE with you guys, and 
then I failed to get my cross-cultural conquest on over the weekend, so 
I'm real withdrawal--even though I get bored of it after a week of solid 
play.  It would be so great if we got together tomorrow when Allan 
doesn't want to play Roge Spear and John wouldn't show up.  That would 
be like ... my dream. 
-Matt 
PS. Allan, I suck at Rogue Spear.  At least in AoE, I get to suck as 
part of a cohesive, pan-national military short-bus.

I wanna play a game.  Tonight tomorrow, I don't care, but tomorrow would 
be better.
