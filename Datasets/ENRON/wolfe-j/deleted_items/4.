Can not think of any females...on the male side, maybe Stu or Kevin... 
If camping falls through this weekend, a bunch of people from my office are 
going to the Galveston Sand Castle Building competition this Saturday. 
Want to put it on our back up list?

Could I bring Bear, Matt's dog?  I am custodial dog owner while Matt is in 
Amsterdam.  If so, I think that camping would be fun. 
Where would we go?

Hey Beth- 
This is pretty cool...I think that Kevin could probably stay on after the 
summer and work and finish up school.  I do not think that 
he has very many hours left. 
My apartment complex boilers were down this morning, so I had a cold 
shower.  Very unpleasant...but I turned the heat up to 88 in my apt. to 
compensate.  The pets looked at me like I was insane.

I printed out his resume and will take it to Earl this morning.  We 
probably have a place we can put him, but we need someone until the end of 
the year.  I will give it to Earl, though. 
Love 
Mom 
P.S.  Why would it print out backwards?

 Tami's bright young friend is looking for a summer internship -- 
 anything.... 
 I thought you might take a look. I don't know if we are going to have 
 anything. 
 If you have anything or KNOW [for those of you who work with me] of 
 anything please lemme know or contact him directly.
