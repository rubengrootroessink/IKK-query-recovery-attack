Has he tried to drive it?  If he got water over the seats, then the water got in his oil pan and his transmission oil case.  
Get him to check his dip sticks and see if it looks kind of light brown on both.  If it does not look like the normal dark brown for oil, or lighter colored (not brown) for transmission then he got water in it.  It will ruin his car if he drives it with water in the oil or his transmission.
It sounds HIGHLY likely that he has more water damage than just interior. 
How did Jay's co-worker die?
