Hi Jason!
 It was nice to hear from you this morning.
 The date of Dad's retirement is Aug. 16. Jill and I have to start back to
work on the 17th. Grandma and Grandpa are planning to come too.Is Beth
coming?
I've got to go shopping for Reagan's gift today. Jeanne Hofbauer and Jamie
Kalmer are hosting the shower Sat.
I've got to drop somthing off at Jill and Matt's this morning heading to
Fairview. It's a good excuse to see Mikayl. Well, actually, since I'm the
Gramma I don't need an excuse.(That's my philosophy!)
Tell Alan 'hello' from me. Are YOU eating your veggies??
 Love, Mom
