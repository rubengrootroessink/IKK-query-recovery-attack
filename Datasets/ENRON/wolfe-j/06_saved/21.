Nope... I'm not talking about mine! 
I just wanted to let you know... in case you didn't- 
Veronica and Dad are putting a contract on a house in Angleton! 
Actually I think its in the neighborhood where Jeff Rouse used to live. 
Its near Nathaniel's house off of 35 and 288 near the new middle school over towards the Angleton times. 
Anyway, its got a pool, a workshop for the hot rod, and its four bedrooms-one for each of us kids (yeah right). Anyway, just thought I'd pass on the news in case ya'll hadn't heard! 
As for my house... maybe I'll get it today... maybe I'll never get it. Who knows.
