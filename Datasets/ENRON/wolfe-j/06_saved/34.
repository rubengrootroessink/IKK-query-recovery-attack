GO COOGS!!!

Cougars@Enron has just been added to the Enron website!  We are located in the same area as the Enron Travel, Golf and Cycling Clubs.  From the Enron Home Page click on "Sites."  Then click on "Internal Organizations" and the "Cougars@Enron."  This will link you to our website located at zcougars.com.  Or just add this link to your favorites: http://home.enron.com/sites/

Remember that for every click on zcougars.com, the University of Houston receives revenue.  To access some of areas of our website, you need to register as a new user and obtain an ID and password.  There is no cost or obligation.  Keep in mind that we are currently building the site and will be adding more information on contacts, events and pictures (By the way, if someone knows how to post pics or is willing to do it for us, we would greatly appreciate the assistance!).  Hope to see you all at the Happy Hour!
