Thanks for your continued participation in NomLogic's beta program.  A few things. . .

Sempra Set-up
All of the Sempra users are set-up and prepared to use NomLogic!  Molly and Keith Couch (NomLogic IT) traveled to Connecticut today and spent time gathering feedback from the Sempra users and IT personnel.   Their set-up issues are resolved, and we hope to continue to get good feedback.  If you currently have active deals with Sempra, go for it!

NomLogic-SITARA Interface
The NomLogic-SITARA interface is in production!  In other words, meter changes made in NomLogic interface automatically to SITARA.

Beta Customer Feedback  
We do not want you to be burdened with customer feedback, and some of you may have been with Sempra set-up issues.  If a customer is experiencing NomLogic problems, please direct them to the NomLogic team .  Even though the users have our contact information, they may hesitate to call us.  Please encourage them to do so or offer to transfer them directly to us.  Of course, if you can answer their question, please feel free to do so.  
CommodityLogic Call Center 1-888-334-4204
Molly Sumrow 713-853-4249
Carrie Slagle 713-853-9810

More Beta Customers
Many of you do not have active deals with Sempra.  We are in the process of training additional beta customers.  Once the users are ready to go, we will let you know!

Thanks again,
Carrie

Thank you all for your continued support of CommodityLogic.  A few miscellaneous items. . .

SITARA Interface
From SITARA's production environment, SITARA is currently sending deal data to NomLogic.  The interface from NomLogic to SITARA will be moved into SITARA's production shortly.  Over the next few days, meter updates and changes in NomLogic will not be automatically interfaced back into SITARA.  We will let you know as soon as the SITARA code is moved into production.

UNIFY Interface
Be sure to select the "Publish to NomLogic" box in UNIFY each time that you open UNIFY Path Manager.  

Confidentiality Agreement
Please keep in mind that the names of our Beta clients are protected by a confidentiality agreement.  The names should be shared only with those Enron employees who have a clear "need to know."

Thanks again,
Carrie
