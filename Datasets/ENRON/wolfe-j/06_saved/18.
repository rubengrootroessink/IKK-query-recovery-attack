Hello All - 

Just a reminder that there will be a Training Meeting tomorrow in 32C2 at 4-6pm.

Thomas Martin is scheduled to speak.  

Tom requested that if there was any topic you were interested in above and beyond his lecture to let him know at the end of the session tomorrow. 

Thank you,

Adrianne
