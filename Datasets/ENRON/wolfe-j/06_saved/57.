GO COOGS!!!

Cougars@Enron will be holding a Happy Hour on Thursday, June 21st beginning at 5:00pm at New York Pizzeria.  Come join us for networking, socializing and enjoy the free buffet.  More information to follow early next week. 

To help in clarification of membership, dues, website, etc., I have forwarded these FAQ's:

1. Who is considered a UH alum?
An alum of UH is anyone who has completed at least 6 hours of credits.  One can be enrolled at UH and still be considered an alum as long as 6 hours are completed successfully.

2. What do I have to do to be a member of the Cougars@Enron Alumni Group?
Nothing!  You are already a member of Cougars@Enron if you have completed at least 6 credit hours.

3. Do I have to pay dues to Cougars@Enron to be a member?
No.  You must be an Enron employee AND have completed 6 credit hours.  Cougars@Enron is an extension of the Houston Alumni Organization (HAO).  Therefore, you can pay dues to be an official dues paying member which comes with various benefits.  However, Cougars@Enron Board Members MUST pay dues.

4. Does Enron match dues?
YES!!  You can complete an Enron "Matching Gift Form" located on the Community Relations website.  You can have Enron match 100% of your contribution.  For example, a one year membership is $45.  Enron will match the $45 so HAO would receive a total of $90.  Or you can pay $22.50 and have Enron match for a total of $45 and you get the full benefits of a one year member!

5. How do I pay dues?
Just contact me (Tracey Kozadinos x6-7405) and I will inter-office an HAO membership form and "Matching Gift Form."  You can then complete both forms and mail to HAO.  Or you can fill out forms at our upcoming events.

6. Does Cougars@Enron have a website?
YES!  Just click http://community.zuniversity.com/z/EnronCougars and then save it as one of your favorites.
