GO COOGS!!!

Want to win a Ferrari?  Or find out what popular band will be playing a free halftime show? 

Our next Happy Hour will be held this Thursday, June 21st from 5:00 - 7:00 at New York Pizzeria (on Polk/Smith across from the fountain).  Come visit and network with fellow Cougars and enjoy the free pizza and pasta buffet.  ALSO, if you sign up to be a dues paying member of the Houston Alumni Organization OR show your current membership card, your first beverage is free.  For those of you who have already requested a form this past week, I'll have a list of your names at the table OR bring your form with you.  An HAO representative will be present to accept membership forms.

We'll have Jim Polamsky of the Cougar Club talk to us about how you can win a Ferrari at a UH football game (compliments of Gallery Furniture) and other exciting events this season!  Other events include a half time performance from a popular band and BBQ cook-off.  Hope to see you all at the Happy Hour!

GO COOGS!
