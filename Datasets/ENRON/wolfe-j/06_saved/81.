Maybe Jill or Mark can assemble a get  together.  I have a new baby, you know, so I have to plan to find a  babysitter.  Maybe a lunch would work better?  Would love to see  you.

Hi all,
 
I just wanted to send you a quick note to let you  know I am making a trip to Houston and would like to see each of you.  I  will be in town from June 23 through July 1.  Please let me know what  your schedule will be like that week, so I can see you.
 
Hope to see you soon,
Alan
