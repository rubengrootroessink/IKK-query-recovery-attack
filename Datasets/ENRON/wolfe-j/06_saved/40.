Hello Associates & Analysts, 

I am writing you to give you a heads up about an important email you will receive shortly.  

You will receive an email via Laura Ann Jones, a Summer Associate, asking you to register with an online contact database called "Pool Information Guide."  Please follow the link in her invitation to register with the site and then to enter your contact and background information.  

The information in this contact database can be used by the entire Pool.  In addition, it will be used by the Recruiting office to publish the "Summer Intern 2001 Pool Information Guide."  Each Associate and Analyst is responsible for entering their own contact information by Monday June 25 so that we may start the presses.  

If you have difficulties registering with the site or updating your information, contact Laura Ann at laura.jones@enron.com.  If you would like more information about why certain fields are required or about security, please contact me.

Thank you -

     Jackie
