> Total Counties won by Bush: 2,434
> Total Counties won by Gore: 677

> Population of counties won by Bush: 143 million.
> Population of counties won by Gore: 127 million

> Square miles of country won by Bush: 2,427,000
> Square miles of country won by Gore: 580,000
>
> States won by Bush: 29
> States won by Gore: 19
>
> And an even more remarkable finding....
>
> Average Murder per 100,000 residents in counties won by Bush: 0.1
> Average Murder per 100,000 residents in counties won by Gore: 13.2
