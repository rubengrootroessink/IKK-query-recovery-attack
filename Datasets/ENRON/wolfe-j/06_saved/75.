Take me out to the ballgame!  Enron employees are invited to come out and enjoy the Second Annual Enron Night with the Houston Astros.  On Friday, July 20th, cheer on our Astros as they face off against Sammy Sosa and the first place Chicago Cubs at 7:05pm.  You can be part of this special night and support Mark Koenig, a Sunshine Kids board member, and the Sunshine Kids organization, as they will throw out the ceremonial first pitch.  In addition, you can hear the Enron Choir perform our National Anthem and if you're one of the first 15,000 fans through the gates, you will receive an Astros replica batting practice jersey sponsored by Enron.

If you are one of the first 200 employees to purchase tickets to the game you will be automatically entered to win a Enron Field Gift Package courtesy of the Signature Shop including, the new Enron Field golf shirt, Enron Field stadium replica, and an Enron Field coffee mug ($100 value).  The winner will be announced in Enron in Action on Monday, July 9th.

Tickets are limited and will be on sale from Monday, June 11th through Friday, June 22nd, so don't miss out on this exciting night of baseball.  Discounted tickets will be only $8 each and to order your tickets or for more information, please go on-line to www.enronsigshop.com and click on special events.
