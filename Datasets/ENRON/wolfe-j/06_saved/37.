Hello Fellows. Just a quick note to my H-Town homeboys as it were. Any of
you float away in the floods? Putnam, I heard you had some damage, sorry to
hear about that. If any of you have brilliant ideas for a new and exciting
career for me to pursue, I'm all ears. This unemployment thing is getting a
bit old. Jay, if you have any advice on how to make the most of these days,
speak up. I like to learn from the masters. I'm going to a place called
Peter Luger's tonight for Susie's birthday. It's considered by some to be
the best steak you can buy in America. We'll see how it stacks up to P.J.'s.
Take it easy boys.

--Eric
