      J...Rex has already come back with his standard "the boss has me 
   working 
      on a project" but that is normal for the boy... 
      When you get good a position keeping you need to send your resume to 
      Williams, we are going to hire another position keeper in the near 
      future for the Houston office.

      Yes I am still in nat gas, finishing my second rotation. How are you 
      liking 
      Williams? I don't interact with any of the crude or crude 
      products people here. Hopefully I can make the lunch. Let me know if 
      11:30 
      is the firm time.

         Your at Enron you work all day long....and night too.  Rex 
   normally 
         needs a little later time also. 
         So how is it going over there, you still in nat gas?  We just got 
         through hiring the former head of your products group...Dave 
      Bochlett.
