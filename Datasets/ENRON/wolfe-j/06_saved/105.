Please answer all of the questions below... 
Are we going to look for a ring tomorrow?  
Do you know what size she wears? (I'm working on finding out myself) 
What time frame do you want to work with for an engagement? (Yes a TIME FRAME)  (ie, in a week, month, year...) 
I have the impression that beth wants you to take care of the whole wedding thing, is this true? 
She says she wants to go away (deffinately tropical because she has never seen blue water) and invite close family members (parents sibblings) and close friends by sending a letter/invitation.  She says they will need time to save if they are going to come, so I suggested 6 months.
Does this sound appealing to you? 
FYI... My brother went away to get married and I have a friend who went away so I have experience in planning tropical weddings.  They are great because only those who you want there come and others aren't affended for not being invited because y'all went away.  You can have a dream wedding for just a little more than what a nice vacation would cost.  It is alot cheaper than having one here which is probably important if y'all are paying for it.
What is my budget for the ring? 
What is my budget for the wedding? 
Please answer all of the questions above to the best of your ability.  This is crucial to the success of your engagement.  Thanks for your help!
