Subject: HABITAT FOR HUMANITY: Quarterly FORMations event! 
Importance: High 
The FORMations Quarterly Event will be: 
Habitat for Humanity 
When: Saturday, July 14, 2001 7:30a - 3p (in shifts) 
Where: TBD 
Note to Guide Family Leaders: This is an excellent way to promote fun and 
cohesion within your guide family.  The competition is on to see which 
guide family will have the most participation at this event. 
The Houston Habitat for Humanity event is open to anyone at all whether you 
work for EnFORM or not, so bring your family, friends, and out-of-towners. 
Please join us, especially if 
you are new to EnFORM, to get a glimpse of a key part EnFORM culture. 
Participants will need to watch a very very short (about 10 mins) training 
video and will be required to sign a release form in order to participate. 
 Informative packets will also be distributed explaining Habitat for 
Humanity's mission and the types of tasks involved. 
If you are interested in participating, please respond right away with your 
shift preference (morning or afternoon) to me.  Also, please indicate if you 
have 
any tools that you can bring.  Tools will be carefully monitored at the 
site to ensure that they are returned in good condition. 
We are currently making arrangements for food/snacks, etc.  Also, we will 
need people to perform a few specific roles (Brown Bag Coordinator, Tools 
Coordinator, Waterboy, etc).  More information will be distributed once we 
get a list of interested EnFORMers together. 
Our quarterly events represent EnFORM's mission to be a good neighbor and 
give back to the community.  It is very impressive when we are able to 
supply large numbers of volunteers to causes such as this one.  In 
addition, it's a fun way to meet new EnFORMers. 
Thanks!
