The Houston community is well known for assisting neighbors in need, and Enron is no exception. There are numerous opportunities over the next week to help rebuild our community in the aftermath of Tropical Storm Allison. 

Four Enron sponsored activities will take place during business hours this week. Enron is also holding a donation drive and a blood drive. There are many agencies that need volunteers at different times throughout the week, and we have listed these opportunities, as well. If you are interested in helping out these groups, please call the individual contact phone number listed for each project.

Thank you for volunteering your time to help the Houston community during this time of great need. Please feel free to send this information to other friends and family who may be interested.
