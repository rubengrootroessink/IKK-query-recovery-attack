Hey Jason!
 What have you been up to other than working?
 Dad has a Church Council meeting tonight so I'm sending some mail.
 I have to go shopping tomorrow for a bridal shower gift for Reagan Parsons.
She's getting married next month in Hawaii. Iris is living in St. Louis but
I haven't seen her in several months. Her sons introduced her to a nice guy
I've been told and they are hitting it off.
 We had some exciting local news today! The New Baden branch bank of First
Federal was robbed this a.m. by 3 armed men wearing costumes. No one was
hurt but one guy is still on the loose. Two vehicles led about 20 police
cars on a 110 mile an hour chase on 64 to a residential neighborhood in East
St. Louis. The story was on all 4 St. Louis stations today. Hopefully,
they'll have more details at 10.
 I'm working on salary negotiations for our union. Actually, it is for all
the educational support personnel as we are referred to now. I'm meeting
with my committe Thurs. to inform them what the Board has countered with.
The salary will be the sticky issue as usual. I hope we won't be working on
it all summer.
 Sandy and I had a great time as usual! I was worn out from laughing! We had
fun at our class reunion despite the lame attendance of our class--22
members (excluding spouses) out of 94. We stopped by Grandma and Grandpa's a
couple of times. Sandy and I also went to Galena one day.
 Tigger and Sweet Pea say "hi".  O.K.  I lied--they're sleeping! What a
surprise!
Have you gotten an airline ticket to come to Dad's retirement luncheon and
ceremony? Is Beth coming?
 Let us know how you're doing.
 Love, Mom
