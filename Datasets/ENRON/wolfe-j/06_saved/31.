 Let's do a matinee on Saturday!  We know it's going to suck; why pay full price?  Let's spend the savings on theater hot dogs (the best kind).

Sometimes, but not often...and in this case...it still doesn't help 
despite my amusement. 
Miss me? Let's go see Tomb Raider. I hear it sucks, but I don't care.

Seeing someone suffer makes you like them more.  Today, I watched Dave 
Baxter (AKA The inane country-boy from Nantucket) defend himself after 
making the comment about his dog's humping habit "It's not about sex, 
it's about domination."  Brian Buvinghausen and I nearly fell from our 
chairs. 
May we suggest "Doggie-Domination.com"?
