Dude, i think that may have been the funniest e-mail I've ever read. Trouble
is, my life bears a striking resemblance to that e-mail. I guess that's not
all bad. I'm starting to get bugged about finding a job in Durham. I'm
looking on the internet but everything seems to involve more work and less
alcohol than I'm interested in. Keep the tips coming, I've got to drink now.
