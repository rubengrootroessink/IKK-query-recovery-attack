* Level (Recreational or Intermediate)

Please email me by WEDNESDAY, JUNE 13 if you are interested.

Many of our EnFORMers have played volleyball out at Third Coast, and I think all can assure you it's a fun time! It's a great way to unwind after work, get some exercise, and meet those you don't have a chance to work with!
