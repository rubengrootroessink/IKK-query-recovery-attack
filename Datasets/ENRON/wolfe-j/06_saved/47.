> IF NOAH LIVED IN THE UNITED STATES, TODAY . . .
> And the Lord spoke to Noah and said, "In one year, I

> of living
> thing on the earth. Therefore, I am commanding you to
> build an Ark." In a flash of lightening, God delivered
> the specifications for an Ark. In fear and trembling,
> Noah took the plans and agreed to build the
> Ark."Remember " said the Lord, "You must complete the
> Ark and bring everything aboard in one year.

> Exactly one year later, fierce storm clouds covered

> please forgive me!", cried Noah. "I did my best, but

> 1. I had to get a permit for construction

> 2. Your plans did not comply with the codes.

> 3. I had to hire an engineering firm and redraw the

> 4. Then I got into a fight with OSHA over whether or

> flotation devices.
>
> 5. Then my neighbor objected, claiming I was violating

> yard, so I had to get a variance from the city

> 6. I had problems getting enough wood for the Ark,
> because there was a ban on cutting trees to protect
> the Spotted Owl. I finally convinced the U.S. Forest
> Service that I needed the wood to save the owls.

> 7. However, the Fish and Wildlife Service won't let me
> catch any owls. So, no owls.

> 8. The carpenters formed a union and went out on
> strike. I had to negotiate a settlement with the
> National Labor Relations Board before anyone would
> pick up a saw or a hammer. Now I have 16 carpenters on
> the Ark, but still
> no owls.
>
> 9. When I started rounding up the other animals, I got

> only taking two of each kind aboard.
>
> 10. Just when I got the suit dismissed, the EPA
