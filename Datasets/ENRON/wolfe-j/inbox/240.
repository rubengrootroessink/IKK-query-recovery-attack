All,

This email is directed to my peeps at Enform who may be interested in a night at the Alley,
to see the "international comedy sensation" -  "Art!!!" 
(exclamation points added by me for necessary emphasis)

Corporate design tyrants like Beth, who just need to relax - it's the perfect thing!

Tyrants-up-and-coming and current princess-wanna-be's: Ashley, it's meets your
faux-high-society sensibilities to a T!

Posing celebrity-satellites: Matt - it beats hanging out at the Starbucks, but requires pants!

Invite your friends and foes alike!

Oct 12 tickets are still available, section A, for about $45 a piece. Get back at me, playas,
they're going fast.

Drinks and the theatre, how do you beat that?

Whoooooo!

Jason
