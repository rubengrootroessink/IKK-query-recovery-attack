A few relevant points: 
1) you WILL be attending"Art" 
2) you may remove and re-don pants at your leisure during the show, but 
you 
WILL arrive and leave suitably dressed. 
3) AoE should be ON tonight, or some acceptable replacement 
strategy/shooter 
game playable by 4+ people.

    On a more relevant note, Jason, drop that hamster. 
   I will not be attending any alley sessions with you ghetto freaks. 
   Why we are not playing AOE today, I do not know.

   All, 
   This email is directed to my peeps at Enform who may be interested in 
a 
   night at the Alley, 
   to see the "international comedy sensation" -  "Art!!!" 
   (exclamation points added by me for necessary emphasis) 
   Corporate design tyrants like Beth, who just need to relax - it's the 
   perfect thing! 
   Tyrants-up-and-coming and current princess-wanna-be's: Ashley, it's 
   meets your 
   faux-high-society sensibilities to a T! 
   Posing celebrity-satellites: Matt - it beats hanging out at the 
   Starbucks, but requires pants! 
   Invite your friends and foes alike! 
   Oct 12 tickets are still available, section A, for about $45 a piece. 
   Get back at me, playas, 
   they're going fast. 
   Drinks and the theatre, how do you beat that? 
   Whoooooo! 
   Jason
