Dear Auction Winner,

Congratulations on winning the item(s) listed
above!

This Email is to notify you that the latest items
you won from us on eBay are ready for processing.

Unless you're bidding on other items that haven't
closed, please go to our online invoicing site to
enter your shipping address and confirm your
invoice.
It will take you less than 1 minute and allows us
to
serve you much better.  As always, your
information
is strictly confidential and a secure site is
available
online.

Please reference the web page link found at the
top of this email.  It should log you right into
the invoice.  Your access code is also listed
at the top of this Email in case it does not.

AuctionHelper.com is very simple, takes about 1
minute and makes Auction life much easier!

To save our customers money on shipping we
combine multiple items into a single invoice.
Please note: We will ship to the United States
only. The shipping charge is for insured
shipping. Items paid with checks may be held
until the check clears, due to a high dollar
transaction or a low feedback record.
Sorry, we don't accept paypal. Check or money orders only.
If you have any questions please let us know.


Thank You,
Discount Sportscard Co.
