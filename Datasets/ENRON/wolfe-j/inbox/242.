Jason,

	The Gas Daily Curves are loaded into the system everyday at 6AM
	or something when they have problems, the curves are loaded at
	around 11AM. I can get these curves as soon as they get it.
	However, Index curves are loaded by GGREENA, CFRANK2, and CRABON
	at around 3PM or 4PM. I will not be able to get these curves.
	I can get Yesterdays Index curves.
