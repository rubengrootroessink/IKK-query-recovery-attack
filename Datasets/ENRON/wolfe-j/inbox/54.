Beth- 
Here is Kevin's resume...if you can think of anything at your company...or 
if anyone you know is hiring, he is open to just about anything. 
My sister came down this weekend, but I will call you soon and we (Jay 
included) can get together for a movie or whatever else there is 
to do.

Tamara Muffat, 
Hey girl.  I am sending this email in hopes that you can save me from the 
boredom in which i have grown accustomed to living. 
Attached you will find my resume...if you happen to think about it and 
someone 
is interested, GREAT...if not, no big deal.  I AM interested in ANY line of 
work (even janitorial at this point). 
Well, i hope you are having a great day at work so far and i hope you don't 
miss Matt too much. 
By the way...stu and i had a question for you...you are paying the bills, 
right?  well, if so, that means you have mattie-poo's checkbook.  we were 
wondering if it would be possible to borrow it to go shopping.  We fill it 
is his turn and it would best be served when he wasn't here....more food 
for 
us.  Anyhow, let us know what you think, we could even buy you a few 
things. 
Anyhow, have a great day at work, and you know my phone number if you need 
me. 
Kevin Dikes
