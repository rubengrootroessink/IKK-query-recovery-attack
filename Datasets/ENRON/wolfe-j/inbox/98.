		A Henwood Multi-client Study	
		 	
		Henwood Energy Services, Inc. (Henwood) offers an opportunity to participate in a cutting edge study of the potential collision of coal and gas and its implications for the electric industry as the battle for the fuel at the margin unfolds.	
		 	
The recent rise in natural gas price over the past year, culminating in a price spike of historic proportions in January 2001 has many industry participants reevaluating the role of natural gas as the "bridge fuel" for the twenty-first century. Some observers suspect that low cost gas reserves are tapped out, making reliance on this fuel alone imprudent from an overall portfolio standpoint. 		[IMAGE]	
		 	
		 Currently, there are plans in the works for nearly 40 coal power projects across North America representing 20,000 MW of capacity. Henwood's scenario-based study is designed to cost-effectively enable utilities and project developers assess the regional viability of new, commercially available coal technology using cutting edge screening analysis and their impact on new gas projects.  Participation is limited - sign-up by June 15th to receive the Charter Member price and to participate in the kickoff meeting scheduled for June 20th at the Hyatt Regency Downtown, Houston. Also sign up for the Henwood ERCOT PMA Workshop on June 20th at the same location by calling Jessica Fielder at 916/569-0985.
