been up to about the same here.  things are getting crazy.  how is
everything going down there???

im heading home for thanksgiving which will be good.  i need to get out of
maine again.  hoping to drive down to visit shelly in upstate new york
sometime early next year too.  dont know when im going to make it down to
houston again. election years are never good for very lengthy vacations but
might take a quick one during the summer.  otherwise i will hopefully aat
least make a trip sometime right after the election.

well talk to you later. hope everything is going ok.
