We are going to go camping in Austin the last weekend of July.  We are 
getting a cabin.  I think Vickye and Billy; maybe Johnye Leigh and Steve? 
 Granny and Papaw and Morgan.  Saturday, we are going to ride a train to 
Burnett and shop.  Do you and Jay want to go?  I am getting it for Thurs, 
Fri, and Sat night; July 26, 27, & 28.  Let me know. 
LOVE 
MOM

I've already paid it.  I will call and get the address changed, if you want 
to keep the phone. 
Love 
Mom

I'm sorry I didn't get back to you right away about the Nextel bill. I 
forgot until just now. Could you either pay it and I'll send you a check, 
or 
mail it to me and I will take care of it. Ergg. Hey -- I am finally getting 
my car fixed. Yeah!
