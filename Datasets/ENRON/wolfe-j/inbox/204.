   Word of the Day for Wednesday October 10, 2001: 
   recherche \ruh-sher-SHAY\, adjective: 
   1. Uncommon; exotic; rare. 
   2. Exquisite; choice. 
   3. Excessively refined; affected. 
   4. Pretentious; overblown. 
    . . .  recherche  topics  interesting  only to university 
     specialists. 
     --Katharine Washburn and John F. Thornton, Dumbing Down 
     [S]he was mocking the pretensions of the cookery writer who 
     insists  on  recherche  ingredients  not  because  of their 
     qualities but their snob value. 
     --Angela Carter, Shaking a Leg: Collected Writings 
     In recent years, Garber's appetite for the rigors of theory 
     seems  to  have diminished. The books have kept coming, but 
     the italics-heavy meditations and the recherche terminology 
     have receded. 
     --Zo?  Heller, "House Arrest," [1]The New Republic, July 3, 
     2000
