As you know, we have a new book runner for the west.  I have asked Kam Keiser to go ahead and set up two new books for you guys.  Matt's book will be IM WC Socal, and Jason's will be IM WC Nocal.  These books will be ready for when we move into the new building.  I will transfer any positions that I have to you guys at gas daily mid.  You will make the markets for your own books.  We will address having you guys take the gas dailies in the near future.

Congratulations!  

Mike
