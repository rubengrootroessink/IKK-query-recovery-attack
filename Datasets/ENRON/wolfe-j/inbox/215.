===8<==============Original message text===============
I recently won two of your auctions. One is 5 posters, one is 18. I am
excited
about these posters, but I have a couple questions. Are the 5 posters in
the first
set completely included in the set of 18? If so, is it possible to get
any non-duplicates
that you may own in the same theme that will not be doubled up in these
sets?

Thanks for the product.
Jason
