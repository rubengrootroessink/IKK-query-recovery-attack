   I want to take some classes at UH. Would you want to take some with me? 
   Can we try to remember to talk about it tonight?

   I realize that I will never get tickets by the time all you mullets make 
   a 
   decision. So the new date is OCT 20th. Take it or leave it. 
   Again, if you can go, let me know by tomorrow. 
   And Ashley's paying.

      All, 
      This email is directed to my peeps at Enform who may be interested in 
   a 
      night at the Alley, 
      to see the "international comedy sensation" -  "Art!!!" 
      (exclamation points added by me for necessary emphasis) 
      Corporate design tyrants like Beth, who just need to relax - it's the 
      perfect thing! 
      Tyrants-up-and-coming and current princess-wanna-be's: Ashley, it's 
      meets your 
      faux-high-society sensibilities to a T! 
      Posing celebrity-satellites: Matt - it beats hanging out at the 
      Starbucks, but requires pants! 
      Invite your friends and foes alike! 
      Oct 12 tickets are still available, section A, for about $45 a piece. 
      Get back at me, playas, 
      they're going fast. 
      Drinks and the theatre, how do you beat that? 
      Whoooooo! 
      Jason
