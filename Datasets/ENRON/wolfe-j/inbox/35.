The house was about six thousand dollars less than the "pool" house... 
it was built in 1996. There are other houses in the neighborhood that are also nice... (included some that are exactly like mine... kinda sucks but its cookie cutter type plan)....
Anyway... I'm starting inspections and appraisals on it now... and expected close is the third weekend in June. 
We had fun last night... it was more of a date type thing. Went and listened to the band for about 35 or so minutes then went to WIllie G's and had a nice dinner.
What are you up to this weekend??

The band is free. 
Its Rock on the Dock night. 
The house is in SouthBridge... in between Pearland & Pasadena... 
Its a good little drive, but the house was built in 96... and has 
new carpet and paint throughout... its kind of cool.

ashleys thing is a long story ask her. 
that's great -- where is it and how much did it cost? 
i doubt it on the kema thing -- jay and i are trying to save money and 
we have been having to go to bed pretty early - otherwise we are 
comatose during the day.

The contract was accepted... I just bought a house! 
Actually it still has to pass inspections... and I have to get all 
the lender stuff taken care of... but atleast someones finally taking 
me serious. 
Want to go to Kema tonight to listen to a band? (rock and roll - not 
country) 
T.C. 
you never said why Ashley was looking for a place to live??
