Hookers? Maybe when you are in Portland. Please do not have them sent to the apartment.

The stream of internet bullshit is never-ending. 
If the FBI had ANY concern about this, we would see it on the news. 
But I heard from a friend's friend that the Taliban hates atheists (like 
myself) most of all, and believes that if you give them lots of money they 
will destroy themselves in an orgy of hookers and cocaine - because they 
are 
immoral, Godless creatures. If you don't do as they say, they will blow up 
your house on the 10th day of the 10th month of this year (like Nostradamus 
predicted). 
Checks or cash (or hookers) can be sent to: 
2300 W Alabama  Apt 6 
Houston, TX 77098 
Thanks, 
Jason
