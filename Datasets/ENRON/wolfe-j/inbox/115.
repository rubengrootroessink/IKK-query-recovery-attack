My Romantic Horoscope for Today:
 
The pieces of a two-piece puzzle just don't seem to want to fit together. You've tried countless angles, jerry-riggings and creative solutions, but you keep coming up short. Perhaps the answer, then, is to work with the flaws between the pieces as well as the pieces themselves.
