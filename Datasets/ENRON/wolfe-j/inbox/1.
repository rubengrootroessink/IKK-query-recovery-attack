JZA,

You'd better have a warm up game before I get down there...  I should be
playing at least once sometime in the next month.  Maybe I'll learn a new
game or two to teach you guys.

So, just mark it down on your calender right now.  I get into town on June
23 and I fly out the next Sunday.  And Lissa's wedding has been cancelled,
but I will still be haning out with Shelly on Saturday night.  Any interest
in an Astros game on Sunday afternoon, June 24?  I figure you've got all the
connections to get me into JRon field now.  What night are you going to set
up poker for?  I'll be sure to clear my schedule for that night.  Other than
that, I plan on going out to eat a lot and enjoying a few margaritas while I
am in town.

I may need a place to crash a few nights.  I think I am staying with Becky
at the beginning of the week at least, though Lissa has moved in with her
now, so that might get a little crowded.  I'll let you know when it gets
closer if I will be needing a place to crash.  It would probably be good if
I could stay there on poker  night at least.

Oh, by the way:  I'm not black like Barry White, yo I'm white like Frank
Black is.

Alan
