Folks,

We are scheduling interviews for candidates for the ENA Trading Track on Thursday.   We have 10 external candidates interviewing and we would like your support to mix and mingle with them over an informal lunch at 12:45pm in Room EB42C.

Please let me know if you can attend.

Regards,


Karen
