Dear Citibank Bill Manager customer,

As of October 24, the Subscriber Agreement that you entered into
when you enrolled in Citibank Bill Manager is being assigned by
PAYTRU$T, Inc. to Citibank (South Dakota), N.A.  Paytrust will
continue to administer the service on behalf of Citibank.

This administrative change requires no action on your part and is
being made to enable Citibank to service all of your accounts with
the same team of representatives, including your Citibank Bill Manager
account and Citi(R) Card.  Your membership is important to us and
we are confident that this change will result in better and more
consistent service for you.

An additional change to the Subscriber Agreement provides that either
you or we can require that any controversy or dispute be resolved by
binding arbitration.  Arbitration replaces the right to go to court,
including the right to a jury and the right to participate in a class
action or similar proceeding.

If you have any questions about this change, please do not hesitate
to contact us at support@billmanager.accountonline.com or call us at
1-888-489-8653 from 8am to midnight ET, 7 days a week.

***** Your continued use of the Citibank Bill Manager service will
constitute your acceptance of the revised Subscriber Agreement.
