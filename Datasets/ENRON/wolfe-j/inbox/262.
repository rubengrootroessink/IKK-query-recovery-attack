   Word of the Day for Thursday November 8, 2001:

   hebetude \HEB-uh-tood-; -tyood\, noun:
   Mental dullness or sluggishness.

     While  too  many Americans slouch toward a terminal funk of
     hebetude and sloth, Bendians race ahead with toned muscles,
     wide eyes and brains perpetually wired on adrenaline.
     --"Wild  rides  in the heart of central Oregon: Bent out of
     shape in Bend," [1]Washington Times, August 11, 2001

     Earlier  on,  when we merely democratized fame, we defended
     the  right  of  any  mouth-breather  to  rise from deserved
     obscurity on the strength of his God-given hebetude.
     --Florence  King,  "The  misanthrope's corner," [2]National
     Review, May 18, 1998

     From that solitude, full of despair and terror, he was torn
     out  brutally,  with  kicks  and  blows,  passive,  sunk in
     hebetude.
     --Joseph Conrad, [3]Nostromo
     _________________________________________________________

   Hebetude  derives  ultimately  from Latin hebes, "blunt, dull,
   mentally  dull,  sluggish,  stupid."  The  adjective  form  is
   hebetudinous \heb-uh-TOOD-n-us; -TYOOD-\.
