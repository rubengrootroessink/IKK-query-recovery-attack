I don't mean to intrude, but I saw where you placed an ebay bid for 1981 Fleer.  I wish you the best of luck on the auction, but if you get outbid or want additional copies, www.baseball.dtshops.com has 1981 Fleer for sale at a cost $1.00.

The website has inventories, s/h info, and ordering details.  You can find it at:
