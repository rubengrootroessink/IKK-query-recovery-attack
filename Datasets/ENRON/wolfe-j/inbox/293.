Victory is such sweet bliss. 
Thanks for playing the victim Beth and Jay.... 
It was noble of you. 
I wanted to let you guys know... I got battleground galactica last 
night... I was up until 1:30 this morning playing an extremely warped 
version of Age of Empires. 
As for a review... it is rated "OK" at this moment in time. There is so 
much crap.... I couldn't figure it all out. The coolest part is the 
addition or air units... x-wings and tie-fighters... etc. etc. It brings 
a new point of attack into the game... you can build as many "stone" 
walls as you want... they're not going to hold back the air attack. 
The bad thing is... everything is more bulky... more cluttered... and 
slower (in my opinion)...anyway... I think Jay should have gotten his 
copy too. 
Hairy Potter is on Friday... anyone up for XBOX on Saturday?
