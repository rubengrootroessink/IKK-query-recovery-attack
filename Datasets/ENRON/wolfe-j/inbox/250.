All the cap does is keep the bolt clean so if you need to jump start you can
get a good connection on the bolt.  It also keeps someone from accidently
shorting the battery by grounding a wrench or screwdriver, etc.  See ya.

Thanks. My battery cap looked a little different. I will try to take it off
tonight and will take a picture.
It wasn't obvious to me at the time how the cap worked (it wasn't nearly as
clean around the
battery as grandmas). Hopefully no more problems.

Jason

   Jay,
   Here's 3 pictures as I see Grandma's car.
   One with the hot battery terminal cap on.
   One with the hot battery terminal cap off.
   One showing where the hot cable from your battery connects to your
   starter.
   Hope they help.
   Love Dad
   PS: Let me know if you get these.  I made the files as small as
   possible,
   but don't know if they are too big to get to you.
