All, 
This email is directed to my peeps at Enform who may be interested in a 
night at the Alley, 
to see the "international comedy sensation" -  "Art!!!" 
(exclamation points added by me for necessary emphasis) 
Corporate design tyrants like Beth, who just need to relax - it's the 
perfect thing! 
Tyrants-up-and-coming and current princess-wanna-be's: Ashley, it's 
meets your 
faux-high-society sensibilities to a T! 
Posing celebrity-satellites: Matt - it beats hanging out at the 
Starbucks, but requires pants! 
Invite your friends and foes alike! 
Oct 12 tickets are still available, section A, for about $45 a piece. 
Get back at me, playas, 
they're going fast. 
Drinks and the theatre, how do you beat that? 
Whoooooo! 
Jason
