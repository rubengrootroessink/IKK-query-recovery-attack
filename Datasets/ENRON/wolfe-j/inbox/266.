So, are people in your area getting nervous? Is everybody looking for jobs
at other companies? There are only 3 companies left to interview with
through Duke for Tara. Under normal circumstances she could just contact a
bunch of other energy companies in Houston and probably get as good an offer
from one of them, but with thousands of Enron employees flooding the market,
who knows. Tara found out from a friend of hers at UT that a company called
Peabody in St. Louis is willing to hire anybody with experience at Enron.
Sweet Jesus, I could get season tickets!

If there is an Enron next week, she will probably get an offer. Unless we
are owned by Dynegy.
Then I don't know. Either way, don't quit cleaning boats yet.

   Do you still have a job? Tara is hearing some pretty nasty stuff about
   Enron. She's pretty worried that they are gonna renig on their offer.
