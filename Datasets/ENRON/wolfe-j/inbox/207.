Jason Wolfe,
                        At this time we are taking deposits on the all new 2002 Thunderbirds.  I have several incoming in the next few weeks. Also I have  a sold unit on the premises right now, if you want to stop by and take a look it will be here a for a couple of more hours. If you have any further questions or would like to set up a time to come in, please feel free to give me a call at 713-960-9800 or email me back. Looking forward to hearing from you and
Central Ford thanks you for the chance to earn your business.
