If you already have a team in mind, put your roster together and email me the following:

* Level (Recreational or Intermediate)

* Captain name & information (address, phone number, email) 
If you'd like to play but are looking to join a team, send me the following information and I will try to organize additional team(s):

* Level (Recreational or Intermediate) 
Please email me by WEDNESDAY, JUNE 13 if you are interested. 
Games start Wednesday, June 20! 
Many of our EnFORMers have played volleyball out at Third Coast, and I think all can assure you it's a fun time! It's a great way to unwind after work, get some exercise, and meet those you don't have a chance to work with!
