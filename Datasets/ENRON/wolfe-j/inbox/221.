Yeah!  I am so glad you wrote back.  I can't write much because the free beer starts at 6pm & I can't be late. =)  But, do you know the difference between Origination, Structuring & Transactions?  I got my offer to come back to Enron & those are the areas that Associates rotate through.  I'm not sure I know what those groups do, but it sounds scary!  Anyway, if you have a clue, pass it on to me. =)
How are things with you?  Are you still with Beth?  Are you working crazy hours?  I will write more later, but for now - I am off to Fuqua Friday.....better know as free beer!
-Tara

Jason, 
I hope this is your e-mail address & that you get this message. We 
hadn't heard from you in FOREVER, so I thought I'd see what you are up 
to. I also have some Enron questions for you. So, if you are still 
breathing, reply ASAP & I'll send you a long, juicy e-mail for your 
reading pleasure. =) 
-Tara
