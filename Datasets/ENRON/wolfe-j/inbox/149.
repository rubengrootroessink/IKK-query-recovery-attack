Guys:  We want to change the curve mappings for KERN/LasVegas from SOCAL to PG&E/Topock.  However, there are a few term deals that will be affected when we make the change.

Jason:  I tried to look at the deals to tell you more about them, but we do not have access to Canadian deals.  Can you check with the Canadian trader on these three deals to see if we can change the curves ?

452375
459155
434877

Brain:  Can you also have some one run this down from your end.

Thanks


Anne

Anne,

Perhaps, but there are three deals out there with October and forward activity. The deals however; are done by Petro-Canada - BC and
Petro-Canada Hydrocarbons - BC. The deal numbers are 452375, 459155, and 434877.
Let me know what you decide.

GG
