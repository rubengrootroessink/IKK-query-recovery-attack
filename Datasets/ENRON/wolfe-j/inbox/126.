jason,

West EOL deals now show Blanco data (and will show Needles data once deals have been made for it)

I am working on the SoCal EHR + SoCal Topk + Needles stuff, and will keep you updated on my progess.

Thank you for your patience and contact me with any additional questions and/or requests.
Rishi
