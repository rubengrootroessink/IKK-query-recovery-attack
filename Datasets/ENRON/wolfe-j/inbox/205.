 You people ALLLL SUCK!  I can't play because I have a really tough job that would leave any of you as shells of the humans you think you are.  YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT PRESSURE I'M UNDER!  So go on with your little game, while I subsist on cruel PF Chang delivery and some bits of blow snorted off a stripper's ass.
