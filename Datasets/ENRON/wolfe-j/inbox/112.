Receipts at Deer Island serve year-round industrial loads and a small amount
of mostly heating season residential loads, but are augmented considerably
during the off-peak months (May-October) by storage injection requirements
at Mist.

Jim,

I was wondering if you could provide any info on the Deer Island meter off
NWPL (470)? It is a fair amount of load in the area, and I was just curious
if this was mostly residential, or if there is a plant I am unaware of.  I
appreciate whatever help you can provide.  Thanks,
