Mr. Wolfeman,

I just want to make sure that you have prepared diligintly for the
storm that lies ahead for you this week.  Have you readied you psyche for
what is sure to be trying times for you and your personality disorders?
Have you stepped up physically to meet the demands that will be placed on
your less than adequate physical being?  Have you sought to stabilize your
all to unstable intellect as it will no doubt find itself constantly
belittled by far superior individuals? Jason, I ask you these things not to
intimidate you, but to warn you that most likely you will be the loser of
the group and to make sure that the others attending will not be
dissappointed with your 'loserness' so to speak.  I, however, am confident
that you will live up to all the you can be, nay, to all that you are.  I,
Mr. Wolfe, am placing such a responsibilty on you, because I know that you
have waited your whole life for just such a moment, and I am both happy and
proud to present you with just such an opportunity.  May this be the
beginning of many great things.

Lane

people going as we are moving floors and I will not have my computer or
phone for the next couple of days.
