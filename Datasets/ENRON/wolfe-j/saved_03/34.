> Guess the warnings were true.  Federal Bill 602P 5-cents per E-mail

> 602P
> will permit the Federal Government to charge a 5-cent charge on every
> delivered E-mail.  Please read the following carefully if you intend to
> stay online and continue using E-mail.
>
> The last few months have revealed an alarming trend in the Government
> of the United States attempting to quietly push through legislation
> that will affect our use of the Internet.  Under proposed legislation,
> the US Postal Service will be attempting to bill E-mail users out of
> "alternative postage fees".
>
>   Bill 602P will permit the Federal Government to charge a 5-cent
> surcharge on every e-mail delivered, by billing Internet Service Providers
> at
> source.
>
> The consumer would then be billed in turn by the ISP.
>
> Washington DC lawyer Richard Stepp is working without pay to prevent
> this legislation from becoming law.  The US Postal Service is claiming
lost
> revenue, due to the proliferation of E-mail, is costing nearly
> $230,000,000 in revenue per year.  You may have noticed their recent ad
> campaign:
>
> "There is nothing like a letter."  Since the average person received

>
> Note that this would be money paid directly to the US Postal Service
> for a service they do not even provide.
>
> The whole point of the Internet is democracy and non-interference.  You

to

> Congressional representative, Tony Schnell (R) has even suggested a
> "$20-$40 per month surcharge on all Internet service" above and beyond the

Washingtonian

> Send this E-mail to EVERYONE on your list, and tell all your friends
