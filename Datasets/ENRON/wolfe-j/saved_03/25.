I think that your letter is very eloquent,
but I cannot be with you right now.

When you say not to take for granted
the trust, companionship, and love that we
had established, I think that this is
what is hurting most. My trust in you
was really strained with the abortion issue.
I haven't enjoyed your companionship lately, and
although I love you, I cannot get along with
you. I think you have simply taken these
things for granted too long. I've been
a real partner for some time, you
just didn't notice.

I really need some time apart.
I am going to move on, please do the same.

Beth
