Jason:

Connie Kirby passed along your inquiry about fruit processors natural gas load to me.

You should contact Ed Yates, Sr. VP, California League of Food Processors in Sacramento 916-444-9260 e-mail ed@clfp.com   He has prepared a report on energy use and issues affecting the California fruit canning and drying industry.

Unfortunately, we do not have region-wide gas (or electricity) usage figures for the Northwest fruit industry, or any other part of the region's food processing industry.

Thus far, NWFPA has focused its energy attention on legislative and other political advocacy activities as well as information dissemination..  Also, the Association sponsored a manufacturing energy conservation satellite teleconference on June 13 part of which dealt with natural gas conservation in company boilers.

If you come across some good food industry figures for natural gas  electricity) use for Idaho, Oregon, or Washington, please let us know.  That would be good information for the Association's Energy Task Force, chaired by J.R. Simplot Vice President Rick Fisch.

Connie Kirby:

I am not certain if you are the go-to person on this topic, but I am
trying to get an idea of industrial
gas load in the canning, drying and processing industry in the NW and
northern California,
especially during the peak processing season (currently ongoing).
If you have even general ideas on this, such as start and end times, and
how the processing is broken
down, that would be great. Or if you know of a good contact in your
organization. I am looking
for a broad overview.

I appreciate your help.

Thanks,
