Jason,

Is it possible for you to send any layout you currently have which matches your request. Also I have informed about your request to our supervisor. As I informed you that we do not have any expertise for Access in our group. So if you would like it to be done in excel, then we can look into detail. Once you can send us a sample report on how it should look like, Francis or Karima can give you a time estimates on when it will be completed. 


Regards
Sanjeev
