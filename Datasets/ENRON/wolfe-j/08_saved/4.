Perfect, I knew I could count on you for some good gossip, and no I haven't heard about the second trip...

Write back and fill me in!

Actually, (keep this between you and me, because it is kind of serious), Ted's romance led to some
trouble for him as word got back to his fiancee. He seems to be out of the doghouse, now, though,
which is good. 
The second trip had it's own share of weirdness that I will tell you about another time (if you haven't 
heard from someone already).

Off to a meeting...

I am running things up here, I was tempted to have my assistant send you a reply to your memo however I thought that might be too impersonal...

Just kidding, I'm glad I'm not running things because this old pipe is falling apart...

Also, I don't think you should be dissing JCI just because you've eaten prime rib on yacht with a parakeet collection...  Nothing new is going on here, I think we're getting a new team member next week but nobody with a real opinion has anything nice to say about him.  Did you hear how the second trip to Miami went? I just heard about from the old lady who works for NNG.

Fill me in on the gossip, did anything ever happen with the romances that budded on the trip?  I think it would be pretty difficult to shown back up in the office that next Tuesday!

Later...

Amy,

How's the pipeline business treating you? I haven't talked to you since the Miami
thing and was just touching base. You're probably running the show up there by now.

You should head down to 32 and get some of our lovely bid-week complimentary meal:
James Coney Island hot dogs (from a box) with dilute chili, cheese paste & a side of
tater tots. 

I'm off  to get a real lunch -  let me know what's going on in TW-world.

Jason
