Hey Moneybags,
 You received your tax rebate yesterday in the mail. Again, would you like
me to deposit it in your checking account?
 I've been cleaning my desk this week. It's amazing how much fits into the
bottom! I went thru every paper and receipt so I could throw away a lot of
stuff. There are some great old papers and drawing you and Jill made. I
showed her some of them yesterday.
 I've got to go. I'm going to St. Charles with Joyce Brefeld today.
 Finally I bought the Reptile CD last week.
 Love, Mom
