Attached is a summary of the new gas deal.  Essentially, we will sell selling Gas Daily mid plus $.10 on a variable basis will a cash out on imbalances each month.  This will become effective on June 1 and on a month to month thereafter.  I have added a clause that indicates that EPMI will be assured we will collect our gas costs each month.  Please let me know if these terms do not represent your understanding.
