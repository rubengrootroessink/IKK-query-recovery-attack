Hi Jason,
 Hope you'll have time to answer my messages today.
 We just wanted you to let you know not to bother to bring your suit to
Dad's retirement. A shirt and tie will be fine. (However, pants are NOT
optional!)
 Dad received the Father's day card yesterday. It was a riot! I think Dad is
finished with the tattoos though.
.Please let me know about the check.
 Love, Mom
