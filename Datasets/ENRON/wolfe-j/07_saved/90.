Jason,
 I forgot to tell you about the bridal shower on Sat. Reagan laughed about
your comment about singing in English class. She said to tell you "hi".
Jamie Kalmer and Reagan looked about the same but NOT Jeanne Hofbauer! She's
going to McKendree College and working at Good Ol'Days restaurant in New
Baden. She must be getting part of her wages in food! WHOA! Is she big!
Looks like she put on about 70 pounds. I almost didn't recognize her.
 Anyway, just thought I'd give you  the news.
Love, Mom
