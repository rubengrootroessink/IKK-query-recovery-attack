GO COOGS!!!

As we approach the middle of summer, Cougars@Enron is gearing up for the fall season.  Below is information on FAQ's, Committees, Football Tickets and All Alumni Meeting.

FAQ's
If I attended UH Clear Lake, can I participate in Cougars@Enron?
YES!!  Cougars@Enron includes alumni from all the UH campuses: Clear Lake, Downtown, Victoria and the future Sugarland campus.

Are there still Board of Director seats available?
YES!!  However, we only have a few remaining.  Please contact me at 713-853-3446 for details.

Committees
Every UH alumni is invited to participate in or chair our various committees.  We want each of you to have the opportunity to be involved in your alumni organization.  If you are interested in being a part of one or more of these committees, please call me a 713-853-3446.  Below is info on the types of committees and those that still need chairs:

Golf (need Chair) - This is our most important committee as it brings great revenue for scholarships and to our group.  Our next Golf Tournament will be held March 25, 2002.  Even though it is 9 months away, this committee works year round to find sponsors, golfers, and golf teams as well as arranging awards, golf goodies, etc.  This is a GREAT networking opportunity and LOTS of fun.

Fundraising - This group will create creative and innovative ideas to help raise funds for Cougars@Enron.  This will allow us to provide more receptions, bigger tailgate parties and goodies to all alumni.

Tailgate Parties - Jeff McClellan, past President, is still Chair for this committee.  This group will assist in finding sponsors for food and beverage, help set up the area (tent is done for us) and think of creative ideas to increase attendance.

Happy Hours (need Chair) - Think of places to hold happy hours, schedule with those establishments, negotiate food and beverage discounts and bring in guest speakers.

Brown Bags (need Chair) - Schedule guest speakers and room for Brown Bags.  Topics can include UH Education, UH Sports or Enron information.

Social Committee (need Chair) - This group will schedule and plan the Christmas Party and any other large social events.  This includes budgeting and working with catering services for the events.

Football Tickets
There is still an opportunity to purchase Season Tickets for the 2002 UH Football Season!!  Jeff McClellan is continuing to handle season ticket purchases.  You can contact Jeff at "jmccle1@entergy.com" or myself for information and applications.  Here is the schedule:

Sept 1 - Rice		7:00pm
Sept 22 - UT		7:00pm
Sept 29 - TCU	7:00pm
Oct 13 - Memphis	7:00pm
Oct 20 - Cincinn	7:00pm
Nov 17 - UAB		7:00pm

Undoubtedly, the UT and Rice games will be the most popular.  UH and Mattress Mac from Gallery Furniture will be holding several events including a Ferrari giveaway, chili cook-off with over 250 teams at the UT game and a free concert.  Season Ticket prices for all 6 games start at $150!!!  Contact Jeff for more info.

All Alumni Meeting
Mark your calendars!  We have scheduled our All Alumni Meeting to be held on Thursday, August 23rd. You will meet the new officers and board members, get information on upcoming events and have the opportunity to ask questions.  Since we feel that this is such an important event, we are offering two sessions to give you the chance to attend.  The first session will be held from 11:30 - 1:00 in EB5C2.  The next session will be that evening (Location and time TBA).
