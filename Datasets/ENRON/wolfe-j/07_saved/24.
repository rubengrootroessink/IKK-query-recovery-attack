OK, now we are getting down to the details... 
For those that want to bowl: 
Where: Pearland Bowling Center (about 4 miles East from Bob's house) 
When: Sat. August 4th 
Time: Noon 
Price per game (per person) - $2 
Price for pair of shoes - $1 
After bowling, we will head over to Bob's house for barbeque.  Here are the 
details for the barbeque: 
Where: Bob Volpe's house (about 25 minutes South from the Enform/TrueQuote 
office) 
        3108 Sagewood Court 
        Pearland, TX 77584 
        (281) 412-2319 
When: Sat. August 4th 
Time: 4 pm 
What to bring: We will need a head count and then be asking people to bring 
items like side dishes, napkins, paper plates, cups, condiments, chips and 
dip, etc.  Bob will be providing the hotdogs, hamburgers and beverages, so 
we will need to do our share! 
Dress code: It is Houston...it is the summer...please dress comfortable!! 
Feel free to bring spouses, friends, family, significant others, etc.  Just 
remember to include them in your head count. 
So...what I need from you is your total headcount including yourself by next 
Tuesday, July 31st.  Please let me know which specific activity/activities 
you will be able to make, so Bob knows how much food to buy and I can 
reserve enough lanes for bowling. 
Thanks!  I am looking forward to seeing all of you!!
