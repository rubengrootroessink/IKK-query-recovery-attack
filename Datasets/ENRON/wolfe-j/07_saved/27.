Hi Jason!
 What have you been up to? I miss hearing from you.
The Board approved our .40 an hour raise plus the insurance, the a 4%
increase a year for the next 2 years. They also have to pay any increases in
the insurance rates. This year they increased 20% so at least that's covered
for 3 years.
 Grandma and Grandpa are going to see Grant for 10 days in August. They'll
ride the train to Oregon.
Just wanted to say "hi". Hopefully, we'll have a chance to talk to you this
weekend.
 Love, Mom
