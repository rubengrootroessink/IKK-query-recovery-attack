Hi Jason,
 Grandma and Jill got the packages on Mon.
Also, yesterday you received a check from the IRS. It looks like a separate
letter came too. Do you want me to deposit the check in your checking
account? Do you want me to send the letter or open it to see if it's
important?
 I had to take Grandma to the eye doctor today. (The specialist) It must've
been senior citizen appointment day. It was the routine exam she has once a
year where they dilate her pupils and examine the eyes. Normally, we've been
out of there in 20 to 30 minutes. Today it was 2 and a half hours.
 It is dangerously hot again today.
,Hope it cools down before Dad sprays the trees and shrubs. This area has
had a major infestation of Japenese beetles.
 Better go for now. I  took the mail in and I see that Dad's card is here.
 Love, Mom
