Yes, THE Yoko!

Enron has graciously agreed to be an underwriter for the "Yes Yoko Ono" exhibit at the Contemporary Arts Museum (CAM).  The Associate and Analyst Program has 25 pairs of tickets to the "Members Only" exhibition preview on Friday, July 13, 2001 starting at 9:00 pm.  Yoko will be in attendance.

We have decided to hold a raffle for these tickets with the proceeds going to SEARCH's House of Tiny Treasures, a long-time favorite of the program.  The House of Tiny Treasures, a licensed child-care facility for homeless children, was heavily damaged during the recent floods and is in need of donations to help with repairs.

Each winner will receive tickets for two to the exhibit and an invitation to a cocktail reception before the event.  Chances will go on sale Tuesday July 9th at EB3520a (Jackie Coleman) and EB3521a (Donna Jones).  You can buy one chance for $5.00 or three for $10.00.  The drawing will be held on Thursday, July 12th at 5:00 pm.  The winner need not be present to win.

Please call John Walt at x35379 with any questions
