Jason-

True love conquers all, including Aggie traditions and the fact that she
is not Catholic.  I think that it is sort of sweet.  It is kind of cool
when your friends surprise you like that.  I always saw Stu wanting
to get married and have kids, but I figured that he would have dropped
some hints before he popped the question.  What does he think that I
can't keep my mouth shut (verbal irony here).  Stu broke the news to
Matt by telling him that he would be moving out in 9 months (don't read
into the time span...no significance as far as I am aware).  Matt
said ok, and then Stu added "because I am getting married" and then
Matt let loose a string of holy !@$#$%$ type words.  I guess it is?more emotionally taxing to men when their friends get married.??Later,?Tami
