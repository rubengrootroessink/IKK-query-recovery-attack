j-flizexxx,

it was good to see you while i was in town.  i still can't believe you stood
me up on saturday though...  youre lucky i had a good evening without you.

i had an insane trip home.  i got stuck in memphis overnight because of bad
weather in boston.  it sucked, i got home 16 hours later than i was supposed
to, and i had to pay for my own hotel room since it wasn't the airlines
fault.  now im back to work though, so i am having fun there.  i have to
travel to nearly the northern most point of the state this weekend for a
meeting.  this week is just not fun.

well write back when you get a chance.  tell them not to work you too hard.

alan
