Jason:  This is just to remind you that we have a report out there in SITARA, that might help you.  We can have it modified to include internal trades only.  I will leave the ball in your court, if you need an explanation of the report, or want me to show you how to run it, let me know.

Anne

Bike,
Can you please run the Deal Fixed Price report on development machine. Now you can able to run one report that captures all five of the new West businessunits in one report as opposed to having to run five separate reports.  All five business units roll up into one named West Intramonth Position.  

 Packaged Businessunits are as follows:

ENA - IM WKEYSTON
ENA - IM WPGE
ENA - IM WROCKIES
ENA - IM WSJ
ENA - IM WSOCAL

If you have any questions let me know.
thanks
krishna

Dave:  The Deal Fixed Price Report has been a very valuable tool.  Thank you and Krishna for your efforts.  I have a question for you regarding our transition into multiple books and how it will affect the report.  Beginning in July the West desk will have several physical books instead of just the one ENA-IM West book.  The new books are as follows:

ENA - IM WKEYSTON
ENA - IM WPGE
ENA - IM WROCKIES
ENA - IM WSJ
ENA - IM WSOCAL

We would like to be able to run one report that captures all five of the new books in one report as opposed to having to run five separate reports.  In the position manager for SITARA, we have all five books roll up into one named West Intramonth Position.  Would it be possible to have something similar for this report ?

Please let me know your thoughts.

Thank you.

Anne Bike
