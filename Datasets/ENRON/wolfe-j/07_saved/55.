ahhhh hume.  let's get metaphysical.

yeah things are going well, if a little dull.  i talked to ellwanger last
night, it sounds like he is a little bored, and frustrated with having
nothing to do.

kami and i are doing good, we celebrate two years together this weekend.
we seem to be spending all of our time going to weddings, and my first
college friend had a baby last night.  it is all so grown up.  i even
bought saran wrap for the first time.

how's your lady friend?  anything going on?  do you eat lunch?  do you play
basketball?

i have mounted a plastic spoon catapult on my desk.

soul peace and hair grease, clay

Clay-Flexxx-

Good to hear from you. I am doing fine, but my job has left me ignorant
of anything but what is presented to me daily on one of 3 flat screen
monitors.
I hope you (and your significant other) (and, the rest of your people) are
doing well.
I miss the irreplaceable "culture sophistique" provided by you and
Hotwanger.

Shout back at me, foo
