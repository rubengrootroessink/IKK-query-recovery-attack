Baby News!

EnFORM,
It is my great privilege to announce one of EnFORM  Technology's greatest 'deliveries' since our small company began over  three years ago.   As  you may have heard, on June1st,  at 6:46pm,a small handful of EnFORMers  completed one of the most ambitious technology integration projects in the  history of modern B2B e-commerce initiatives.TrueQuote.com, a web based energy trading exchange, successfully  interfaced it's product and trading transaction engine to the largest  e-commerce site in the world, Enron Corporation's EnronOnline.com. EnronOnline trades approximately $3Billion in energy related products and  services every day making it (by  far)the largest e-commerce platform in  the world.
The magnitude of this achievement can not be understated.  Many doubted that it was technically feasible, and many others thought it was  out-right impossible to keep the trading engines of two completely different  platforms completely synchronized. Well, it is with great pride that I report  to you that since going live with the interface, TrueQuote.com (developed  using SQL Server 2000, VB / COM+, ASP, and a whole-lotta XML) not only keeps in  lock-step synchronization with EnronOnline.com (a Java, Oracle8i, and Web-logic platform), the two platforms have exchanged  over 1.25Million orders in just a few weeks, averaging between 50-75,000every daywith  less than a 1/2 second of latency between the two platforms for each  order.
When you get a chance,  congratulate the team for delivering such an impressive achievement.   Since going live, the baby hasn't even burped!
