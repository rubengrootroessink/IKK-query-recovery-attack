OK, now we  are getting down to the details...
For those that want to  bowl:
Where: Pearland Bowling Center (about 4 miles East from Bob's  house)
When: Sat. August 4th
Time: Noon
Price per game (per person) -  $2
Price for pair of shoes - $1
After bowling, we will head over to  Bob's house for barbeque.  Here are
the details for the  barbeque:
Where: Bob Volpe's house (about 25 minutes South from  the
Enform/TrueQuote office)
         3108 Sagewood Court
        Pearland, TX  77584
        (281) 412-2319
When: Sat.  August 4th
Time: 4 pm
What to bring: We will need a head count and then be  asking people to
bring items like side dishes, napkins, paper plates, cups,  condiments,
chips and dip, etc.  Bob will be providing the hotdogs,  hamburgers and
beverages, so we will need to do our share!
Dress code: It  is Houston...it is the summer...please dress
comfortable!!
Feel free  to bring spouses, friends, family, significant others, etc.
Just remember to  include them in your head count.
So...what I need from you is your total  headcount including yourself by
next Tuesday, July 31st.  Please let me  know which specific
activity/activities you will be able to make, so Bob  knows how much food
to buy and I can reserve enough lanes for  bowling.
Thanks!  I am looking forward to seeing all of  you!!
