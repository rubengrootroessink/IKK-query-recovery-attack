The C.T. Bauer College of Business at the University of Houston main campus has just named Professor Arthur Warga as the new interim Dean.  What an excellent choice!  Anyone who knows Professor Warga or had the opportunity to be instructed by him knows he is a financial genius and is known nationally for his Fixed Income research and Fixed Income training program designed for the World Bank.
