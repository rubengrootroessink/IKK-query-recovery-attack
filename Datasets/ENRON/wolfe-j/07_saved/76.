Do you know that Enron is committed to providing procurement opportunities to minority and women-owned business enterprises?  Do you know how it works?  Ask Calvin Eakins, director of Minority & Women Business Development about his group's goals for 2001.  Tuesday, July 10 on eSpeak at 10 a.m. Houston time.
