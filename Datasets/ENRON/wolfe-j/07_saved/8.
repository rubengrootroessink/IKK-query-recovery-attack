so whens the big trip jazzy j?  ill keep the door unlocked and refrigerator
stocked (with colt .45)...

im working too much so you need to get up here so i can show you the great
state of maine.  i havent had a day off in two weeks, but i think i finally
wont have to work this weekend.  other than that life is ok.  and ive got to
see some of the more rural areas of the state in recent weeks.  hell, i even
got to see some mashed potato wrestling up in aroostook county.  it was
good, but not enough bikini clad women...

ok, so i need to get some sleep.  write back when you get a chance.

I waited Saturday morning and afternoon for bowling. No call. I went out
to eat with Beth and didn't have my phone
with me. Then I get some messages. I thought you said you were going
dancing or something.
Yeah, when I get up to Maine you better be ready. 'Cause I'LL be ready.

Oh, check out this link...it's pretty funny. It spoofs those
motivational posters you find in offices.

Later, playa
