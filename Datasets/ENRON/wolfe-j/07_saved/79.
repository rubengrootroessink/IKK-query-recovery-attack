I think all of our cell phones got cut off because they found out mom was no longer an employee with NEXTEL... I thought it might be because I hadn't paid my bill, but I don't think this was the case....
At any rate, my phone number is 713-987-9992 
Talk Mike into coming too... it'll be fun.

Be there by 6:45! I'll be home around 5:45 so you can come whenever...

So whats the verdict?? Ya'll coming or not! :) 
Mike Nuestadt emailed me and said he might go to... but neither of you 
have committed yet... 
Do I need to email Jay again... Cuz... ya know.. us boys would not only 
kick you girl's ass's at Tabooey... but we'd also win more money at the 
dog track. 
Or are you scared...
