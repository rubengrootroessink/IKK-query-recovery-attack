Beth says your hesitating to answer the call of the dogs! Well they're racing tonight... 1$ Beer.. 1$ minimum wager. You and Beth can crash at my place... maybe we'll play 42 or taboo....afterwards(depends on how late the dogs run)...
Anyway, the invites on the table if you two want to come... Jonda and I are leaving my house by 6:45...and you're welcome to join us... just let me know-
