The system could not handle sending you the file 'CPR-Desk 2 Desk' that is in the Drop box.
You can go there directly and see if this will help you.

Take a look at this file in O:/Dropbox/Sitara   

[Severson, Russ]  I had to delete the attached file 

You might have to run it though terminal server.
See if you can use some of the information

Any question, give me a call.
