As many of you know already, Final Fantasy opens tomorrow, but I'll be seeing it Thursday evening with whoever wants to come along.  Because my Evolution team and I have yet to make it to that one, I suggest we go see it tomorrow evening when Final Fantasy will draw the biggest crowd away from Evolution.  Please email me if you can make a 7 or 8 showing.
