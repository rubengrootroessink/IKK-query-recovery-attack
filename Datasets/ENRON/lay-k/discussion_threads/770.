My consulting assignment at Azurix will end next month, so I've put calls in 
to Cliff and Mark Metts to see if either of them needs help with either 
corporate trouble-shooting, or M&A execution. 

I thought I should also ask a related question of the two of you: anything 
that I could assist you with? 

As to the question whether I can be helpful, I believe that Colin, John, and 
Michael have been pleased with my contributions, though you should ask them 
directly.

Please let me know if you have any ideas.

Thanks.
