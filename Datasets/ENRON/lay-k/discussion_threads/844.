Dear  Mr Lay,

As  you may be aware, the Tata Energy and Resources Institute- North Americ=
a =20
(TERI-NA) is a publicly owned not-for-profit research organization=20
incorporated  under section 501(c)(3) in 1990 in Washington D.C, at the=20
initiative of TERI  (Tata Energy Research Institute), New Delhi. The genesi=
s=20
of TERI-NA is rooted in  the realization that emerging global concerns abou=
t=20
the energy and environment  must bring together new partnerships between=20
developing and developed countries  through active communication and=20
collaboration.=20

In recent years, the South Asian  region,?has experienced an increasing oil=
=20
demand-supply mismatch, thereby  pointing to a growing dependence on import=
s=20
and?enhancing energy security  concerns in the region. It is=20
therefore?pertinent to identify strategies  that need to be developed and=
=20
implemented in a proactive manner so as to enable  an effective response to=
=20
supply disruptions, and to reduce oil import dependence  through fuel=20
diversification, diversification of the sources of supply, and  specific=20
technological interventions.

?India  and the United States have sought a revitalized relationship betwee=
n=20
the world's  most powerful and largest democracies. For the South Asian=20
region, the message  has been one of continuing interest in ensuring peace=
=20
and stability. The timing  is therefore appropriate to undertake a program=
=20
that would facilitate dialogue  between energy producing and consuming=20
countries, identify opportunities for  integrating regional energy markets,=
=20
and assist in enhancing investments in  clean and sustainable energy=20
development.=20

With  these objectives in view, a one-day workshop on =01+Energy Security=
=20
Concerns and  Response Strategies for South Asia=01,, is being organized wi=
th=20
support from the US  Department of Energy, on February 10, 2000, in New=20
Delhi. The workshop is being  organized in conjunction with TERI=01,s 1st D=
elhi=20
Sustainable  Development Summit, which would focus on the challenges that=
=20
underlie global  sustainable development, requiring unprecedented efforts o=
n=20
the part of  governments, corporate organizations, and civil society.=20

?Our  initiative in organizing this workshop is intended to complement the=
=20
efforts  that are already underway for ensuring a stable and secure energy=
=20
sector in the  region. As a follow-up to the workshop, it is proposed to=20
disseminate the  discussions and proceedings thereby ensuring a wider=20
understanding of issues,  and to undertake cooperative research under each=
=20
priority  area.

?In  view of Enron's pioneering efforts in securing safe and stable global=
=20
energy  developments, we would be very grateful if?Enron could consider=20
providing  financial support for this workshop to the extent possible, as=
=20
well as  participate in the workshop. I am enclosing a copy of the proposal=
=20
for your  consideration and would be happy to provide any further  details.

?I  look forward to receiving a favorable response from you.

?With  warm personal regards,

?Yours  sincerely,

R.K  Pachauri
