At the suggestion of  Lucie, Larry, and Tom, we are moving the June Board 
meeting to New York City, on  June 27, 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.? We will be sending 
more information later about  the hotel, meeting location, and dinner plans 
(on the 26th).
?
We hope  that?the New York?location is convenient for  everyone.
