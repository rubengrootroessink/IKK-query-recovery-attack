Dr. Kenneth L. Lay 
Chairman & C.E.O. 
Enron Corporation 

Dear Dr. Lay: 

As part of CERAWeek 2001, you are cordially invited to participate in the 
Leadership Circle, an exclusive program for senior executives to be held in 
Houston, Texas, February 11-16, 2001, in conjunction with CERAWeek 2001 and 
our 20th annual Executive Conference. 

The Leadership Circle has become a highlight of our annual conference, 
bringing together a very high-level, select group of government ministers and 
energy decision makers for informal discussions as well as substantive 
presentations on issues of common concern.

Our focus this year is energy market turmoil and its effect on investment 
strategies, regulatory backlash, and industry structure.? We will also 
discuss the postelection prospects for the economy and US politics. Note that 
we have extended the program in response to member suggestions and have 
included recreational activities on Sunday, February 11, and a reception that 
evening at the unique Paraiso Maravilla in Houston, as well as a special 
Summit on Energy Supply and Investment on Monday morning.

To view the complete program, and for details on sponsorship and 
registration, please visit our web site at

participation or sponsorship, please contact Sabrina Wisner, Leadership
