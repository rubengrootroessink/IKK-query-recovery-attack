Ken,

I finally found Franco Bernabe's work number: +39-06-3600-4741
      +39-06-3600-4742

He actually returned my call (I had left a message with his secretary
saying that you were looking to talk to him). He mentioned that IMI (the
Italian investment bank) would like to do a joint-venture with us to
develop a power trading structure. He will put me in contact with someone
at IMI.

You can reach him at any of the above numbers.

Best wishes
