IMPRESSIVE LETTER FROM LIZ CHENEY PERRY



In this America of  
ours, where the passion for publicity is a disease and
where swarms of  
foolish tawdry moths dash with rapture into its consuming
fire, it was a rare  
good fortune that brought to eminence a man so reserved,
so unassuming, so  
retiring, so gracious to high and low, and so serene.&quot;
Judge Learned  
Hand in tribute to Justice Cardozo, 1938.

Here are some things America  
should know about my dad, Dick Cheney.? He
loves the mountains and  
rivers and prairies that stretch into forever in
Wyoming.? He is of the  
American West.? His handshake is firm.? He looks you
in the  
eye.? His word is his bond.? He is a world class listener, and  
when
he talks, it is always worth listening.? I have never known a wiser  
man.
To my three daughters, he is &quot;Papa.&quot;? Watching him with  
his granddaughters
is a great joy.?? My daughters are young and  
their concerns are the concerns
of little girls -- dolls and play-dough and  
first friends.? He has infinite
time for them, as he always has for my  
sister and me.? He is never rushed,
never hurried.? He is supremely  
kind, loving and patient - listening to
their latest song from school,  
reading bedtime stories, or teaching them how
to fish (a lesson Cheneys learn  
early). 
He grew up in Casper, Wyoming in the days when you could ride your  
bike out
of town and hunt rabbits on the prairie.? His dad, a World War  
II veteran,
was a career civil servant with the Soil Conservation  
Service.? His mom
worked as a secretary at Bustard's Funeral Home to  
make ends meet.? He
pitched for the local American Legion baseball  
team.? He owed much of his
skill to my grandmother, who had played for  
the Syracuse, Nebraska
Bluebirds, a nationally-ranked girls' softball  
team.? She caught his pitches
many evenings on their front lawn at 505  
Texas Place.
He was the first in his family to graduate from college.?  
He built
powerlines across Wyoming and Colorado to help pay his way.? He  
carried a
ticket for six years in the International Brotherhood of Electrical  
Workers.

He married his high school sweetheart, Lynne, in  
1964.?? One look at the
inscriptions they penned in each other's  
high school yearbooks and you know
they were as deeply in love at 18 as they  
are today.? He was the captain of
the football team and she was the  
homecoming queen.? Getting her elected was
his first political  
campaign.
There have been lots of other campaigns since then.? Despite  
his success,
he's not a typical politician.? He's not a  
glad-hander.? He's not a
fast-talker.? He's not slick.? He is  
who he is.? He is real and honest and
true.? 
He loves this  
country.? He knows how blessed we all are to be Americans.?  
He
taught my sister and me that we owe everything we have to the brave men  
and
women who died so that we could be free.? When we were young, he  
took us to
the battlefields where the Civil War was fought.? He taught  
us to love
history and to revere this great nation.???  
Serving as Secretary of Defense was the greatest honor of his life.? I  
have
heard him say that this was because of the troops, the men and women of  
the
U.S. military.? I went with him to Arlington National Cemetery the  
day of
the memorial service for the servicemen and women who died in the  
Persian
Gulf War.?? I stood next to him in the amphitheater with  
the families who
had lost sons and daughters, husbands and wives, watching as  
the military
jets flew overhead in the missing man formation.? It was  
the first time I
ever saw tears in his eyes. 
There are cynics today who  
would have us believe that no politician is a man
of honor.? Maybe the  
last eight years have done this to us.? I hope not.
There are good  
people in American politics today; honorable and wise people,
people who keep  
their word and inspire us to live lives of goodness and
truth.? There  
are leaders among us.? 
In Governor Bush and my father, America has the  
chance to vote for two of
these men this Election Day. 
Liz Cheney Perry
