Pleased to send you last months Blackmore report.

> [Compaq Confidential - Internal Use Only]
> To:  Worldwide Sales & Services team
>
> Another month and another quarter are about to close, and a very sincere
> 'thank you' for all your great work in the quarter.  There has been
> tremendous activity, and September has been filled with headlines about
> new products, new partnerships, new wins, and earlier this week, the
> launch of our new Compaq brand campaign.
>
> This week the senior management team, with the support of many Compaq
> managers, met in San Francisco with more than 100 industry analysts from
> North America, Europe and Asia Pacific where we communicated our vision
> for the future and Compaq's strategy including what we see as the fastest
> growing opportunity around the "edge of the network."  This builds on the
> strategy we launched last November and gives great examples of how we are
> taking leadership in the next generation of e-business requirements driven
> by the growth of both the Internet and wireless.
>
> In addition to the keynote presentations, there were many breakout
> sessions plus informal group and one-on-one discussions. The analysts
> commented that the Compaq team was energized, upbeat and very focused on
> where we are going.  On October 12, we will have a worldwide satellite
> communication of the Compaq strategy to all employees. I would like the
> whole Worldwide Sales & Services team to really understand the
> presentations and quickly become expert in conveying our story to every
> one of our customers and partners throughout the world.  The wins and
> customer partnerships we highlight every month in this report are evidence
> of customers' confidence in Compaq, and I have no doubt that this will
> only increase as we become united in articulating the elements of our
> strategy. You will be hearing more about the communications and training
> efforts around our strategy over the next few weeks.  Until then, I
> encourage you to read the material and presentations posted on Inline at
> http://inline.compaq.com/strategy/usad/index.asp.
>
> During my travels this month I met with many of our employees, customers
> and partners in a number of EMEA operations including Italy, France,
> Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Netherlands and UK. It was
> good to see the whole of Europe, Middle East and Africa getting back to
> growth mode again with clear evidence of new drive and energy across the
> region.
>
> As well as meeting many customers and partners and participating in
> country reviews, I also was able to support the Compaq World Soccer 2000
> competition that was hosted in Munich. This is a great tournament - hotly
> contested each year, and we had a record of 24 men's teams and 11 women's
> teams from Australia, Japan, USA, Latin America and most European and BDG
> countries. Congratulations to Latin America who won both the men's and
> women's events!
>

> provide each of its 75,000 employees with his/her own private Internet-PC.
> The goal of the program, known as "Alle ins Netz," which means "Everyone
> to the Net," is to ensure all of its employees and their families have
> access to the new media, worldwide resources and information.  Compaq was
> selected the exclusive hardware and services partner - a win valued at
> $40M - because of our ability to ensure consistent worldwide products and
> services.
> Employees can choose either a Deskpro EX desktop, including a S710
> monitor, or an Armada E500 notebook. All systems are offered with Windows
> 98 and a large package of application software. The rollout, which
> includes Bertelsmann's 17,000 employees in the U.S., has already started
> outside the company's headquarters in Germany.
> Dublin Technical Customer Support Center (TCSC) brings home the gold
> Most people have been tuning into the Olympics in Sydney nightly, but on
> September 19 all eyes were on Birmingham, UK, where the 5th annual
> European Call Center of the Year Awards were held.  Out of eight  awards
> presented, the Dublin TCSC brought home gold medals in two categories:
> Best Call Center Design and Best Call Center Training.  More than 180 call
> centers from across Europe competed for the prestigious awards.  In July,
> the TCSC was selected one of 30 finalists, and a panel of judges visited
> the TCSC to see first-hand what Compaq does on a daily basis.  The gold
> medals show that Compaq Customer Services is at the top of the industry
> and has a lot to be proud of.  This is a tremendous accomplishment for
> everyone in the TCSC, but particular thanks and appreciation go to the
> Facilities Team and the Training Team for their dedication and effort.
> Congratulations!!
