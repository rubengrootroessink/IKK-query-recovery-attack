Dr. Kenneth L. Lay 
Chairman & C.E.O. 
Enron Corporation 

Dear Dr. Lay: 

I am writing to bring your attention to an important and timely event that 
will be held on September 20th at the Hyatt Regency Columbus, in Columbus, 
Ohio - "The Governors' Natural Gas Summit: Responding to the Challenge." This 
event is convened by the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission (IOGCC).? 
Co-chaired by Alaska Governor Tony Knowles, IOGCC Chairman and Ohio Governor 
Bob Taft, with the participation of other governors, this forum promises to 
be an outstanding exchange of ideas among leaders of government, energy 
producers, transporters, distributors, and end-users on the subject of the 
current and long-term outlook for natural gas resources and markets in North 
America. A very distinguished group of speakers is assembling, including 
senior government officials and senior executives of companies critically 
involved in the energy value chain.

Primary Goals of the Summit include: 

* Exploring and clearly communicating the current dynamics of the natural gas 
market 
* Informing the industry and the public about the current and future supply 
potential for gas 
* Providing governmental and industry leaders with an opportunity to discuss 
natural gas in the context of national energy policy, with the input of 
interested State Governors.

The Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission (IOGCC) and the governors have 
asked CERA to help organize the Summit and has invited senior CERA staff to 
moderate panel discussions on the Natural Gas Marketplace and the Supply 
Response for North America. In addition, I will be providing an opening 
framework for participants and contributing to the wrap-up of the Summit at 
the close of the day with the governors.? We are very pleased to be working 
with the governors and with the IOGCC and its executive director, Christine 
Hansen.

We hope that you can join us for this important event, and encourage you to 
view the Summit agenda on the IOGCC Web-site at: 
http://www.iogcc.state.ok.us/MEETINGS/2000_Governors_Natural_Gas_Summit.htm? 

On this site, you will also find complete registration information including 
fees, registration form, and logistics. 

You may also be interested in a recent Washington Post article on volatility 
in the gas and power markets, which helps provide a context for the 
discussion and which was co-authored by CERA Managing Director Tom Robinson 
and myself. This article may be found on the Washington Post Web-site at:

Should you have any questions regarding the Summit or CERA's participation, 
please contact my colleague Ron Kapavik at +1 936 931 1416 or via e-mail to

Sincerely, 

Dan Yergin
