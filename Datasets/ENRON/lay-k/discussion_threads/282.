Steve: I want you to know that I received calls from two people in this 
office this morning who advised that my successor (Linda) was to be announced 
today. I thought I had a committment from you and Rick that the people in 
this office would meet the final candidates and make input before a final 
decision was made.

The rumors have been very active throughout this process and people in this 
office have been aware of the various candidates. I have gained 98 percent of 
my information from my office collegues. I have not been discussing any of 
these matters with outsiders suggesting that they contact Nils for any 
information.

Naturally, I am concerned how this announcement is to be made because I am 
hoping to have a life after Enron possibly a position in a future 
administration. I have had a very successful tenure from the standpoint of 
accomplishments and establishing the groundwork for additional success which 
my successor will have the benefit. Therefore, I want a very positive 
statement made about my service with a Ken Lay quote.

Joe
