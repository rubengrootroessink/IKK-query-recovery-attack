Ken,

Bruce Peterson at Korn/Ferry International has offered to suggest my name to
various corporations for board appointments.  I plan to leave El Paso at the
end of the year.  Please find attached a draft of my background information.
May I use you as a reference?  Let me know if this meets with your approval.
I enjoyed seeing you and your family at the convention.  Thank you in
advance for your assistance.

Nancy
