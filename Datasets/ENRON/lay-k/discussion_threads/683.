The stricter consents policy (moratorium) on gas-fired generation has been 
lifted, per this announcement.  It also six stations have been approved (they 
are not listed in this announcement), we will try to get the list of six, but 
I am quite sure that our project (Kent Power/Isle of Grain) will be 
included.   mcs
