Dear Ken:  The purpose of this note is to seek your help in becoming a 
citizen of the US.

I've been a Houston-based employee of Enron for nearly 10 years, of which 
seven were with the Dabhol project.  I obtained my green card in 1992, which 
entitled me to apply for US citizenship in 1997.  I recently went through the 
final interview and was awaiting a call to take oath.

Instead, the INS denied my application for citizenship on grounds of my 
extensive travel.  This, despite the fact that:

(1).  A disqualification can be made only if an applicant is 

- out of the country for a continuous period of six months; or
- is out of the country for more than 30 months in the sixty month period 
after the green card.  (Neither of these apply to me).

(2).  I had filed a notification to the INS immediately after getting my 
green card (in 1992) informing them that I will be travelling extensively on 
business.  Filing this notification allows me to travel without the 
restrictions mentioned above.

Ken, I need your help on two fronts:

(1).  Support in filing an appeal to the INS.  This will cost an outside 
counsel between $1500-$3000.

(2).  Request my US Representative Mr.DeLay to send the attached letter to 
the local INS administrator.

I believe this will clear the way for my becoming a citizen of the US, to 
which I eagerly look forward.
