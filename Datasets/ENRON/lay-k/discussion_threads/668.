Talking points for Rupert Murdoch:

Enron and Blockbuster have been working with Fox to obtain the digital rights 
to content for use on our video on demand (VOD) service.

We would like to progress these discussions in a timely manner.  Although Fox 
has indicated interest in working with Enron, they have not been receptive to 
the Blockbuster proposal.

Therefore, any support from Mr. Murdoch for a Fox/Blockbuster VOD agreement 
would be appreciated.
