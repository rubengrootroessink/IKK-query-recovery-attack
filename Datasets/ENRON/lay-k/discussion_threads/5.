Hey there,

I just called your dad and congratulated the "father of the bride"  He was 
VERY cute and walked me through his conversation with JL and his thoughts on 
Florida...FUN FUN FUN - He is so proud of you and thinks so highly of JL - I 
can hardly wait to meet him.

All my love,
Christina

YIPPEE - what fun...I have one more Florida suggestion - The Boca Beach Club. 
 Here is the pitch.

*    2 easy airport to fly into: Miami and West Palm
*    The BBC compound has 4 hotels and at least five restaurants - with
an amazing tower restaurant - which would we great for a rehearsal dinner
*    The four hotels include:  Condos, tower hotel, old estate rooms, and
beach front rooms.  There is a water shuttle and complementary shuttle - that 
is very convenient to transport people around!
*    Beautiful Ball room
*    2 Golf courses
*    Tons of tennis courts
*    Multiple Pools
*    Gorgeous entrance way


We have stayed there at least ten times and always have a great time.  Just a 
thought!
