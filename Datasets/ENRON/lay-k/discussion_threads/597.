Ken,

We'd like to sincerely thank you for heading our way and helping us kick off 
the official opening of Enron's businesses in Japan.  The feedback that we 
have received has been very positive and the website has been a big hit.  
Preliminary figures for the Enron Japan website look promising.  We've had 
over 12,000 page hits over the last three days with an average of >300 unique 
visitors per day.  We have also received quite a few requests for the 10% 
discount product.  The utilities are scrambling to try and understand what 
the product is and why we are doing this.

I also wanted to pass along that while the TEPCO meeting was probably in line 
with what we expected, our interpreter made it clear to me that the TEPCO 
interpreter was very poor and did not accurately convey the meaning and tone 
from the Chairman.  In fact, the TEPCO Chairman was more positive and would 
sincerely like to find ways to cooperate.  We'll try, but I would remain 
somewhat skeptical.

Thanks again.

Regards,

Joe
