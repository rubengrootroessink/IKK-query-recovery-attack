Online Energy Exchanges=01*the next step=20

the consolidation of the online exchanges.  We=01,ve seen independence t ou=

In the past two years millions of dollars have been spent on developing=20
online exchanges by entrepreneurs, publishers, and finally, the energy=20
companies themselves.  Hundreds of exchanges have popped up as a result=20
ranging from procurement to commodity marketplaces.  A few of them have=20
developed the liquidity they needed to stay afloat, and a few have sound=20
business plans that suggest they might be able to stick around until someon=

playing nice with each other.  None of them have seen the promised big=20
profits or even figured out where they=01,re going to come from.=20

The most successful of the exchanges, ones like Enron have been successful=
=20
because they depend on their internal inventories to provide liquidity. Whe=

ergy=20
isn=01,t enough, because they don=01,t have the scope to provide the financ=

information and hedging services that are key to the industry.=20

These realities point us to the key to a successful online exchange=01*taki=
ng it=20
in house.  Develop a vertically integrated exchange, create alliances with=
=20
information and financial providers, and force your suppliers to come to=20
you.  This model will cut costs, outsource non-core competencies and most=
=20
importantly save on the hassle (both in terms of costs and time) of=20
integrating numerous IT and cultural systems.  The key to making the most o=
f=20
the online marketplace is in choosing who will provide the technical backbo=
ne=20
and who will provide the auxiliary services.=20

Perhaps it=01,s time we all woke up and realized that the e-business revolu=
tion=20
is nothing more than a new business tool and we start treating it as such,=

rather than the be-all, end-all.=20
