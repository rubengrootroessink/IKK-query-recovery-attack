Hi Mr. Lewis -

Ken asked me to send you an e-mail stating that he would be happy to submit 
your name for consideration to Dick Cheney.  He asked if you would please 
send him a current bio.  

Thanks.

Rosalee

Ken,

Sorry to miss you today when I called. Since I am leaving for India in a
few minutes, I thought I would sent you an E-mail, and then I can try to
call you from India. Because of the time difference, it will not be easy
for us to connect. Unfortunately I will not be back in the US until
December 7.

The reason for my call was to see if you would feel comfortable putting my
name forward to Dick Cheney for a position in the new administration. I am
not sure where the best fit would be, but it might be Chairman of the
National Economic Council. That job has a good combination of management
and economics. You know I have only been associated with Democratic
administrations in past, but Democratic administrations were a little
different in those days. You are somewhat familiar with my record on
economics and there is a lot on that in the public domain.

Just let me know what you think. Maybe a quick E-mail would suffice ( I am
carrying my computer).

Best regards,
Bill
