Hi Mr. Lay,

They told us in orientation that it was okay to send you an e-mail, so I hope 
I am not rocking the boat here! I just wanted to say that I am proud to be 
working for Enron and Net Works!

From a book review on Amazon.com...


"According to Gary Hamel, the professor-turned-strategy-guru author of 
Leading the Revolution, complacent establishment giants and one-strategy 
start-ups are on the same side of the fence--the wrong side. He blows apart 
the popular myth that innovation lies solely in the hands of dot.com dynamos 
like AOL and Amazon by scrutinizing the examples of such "gray-haired 
revolutionaries" as Enron and Charles Schwab, companies that have managed to 
reinvent both themselves and their entire industries, time and again."
