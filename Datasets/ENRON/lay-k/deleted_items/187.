To Mr. Ken Lay,

I believe it is your duty to to donate the millions of dollars you made from Enron stock before the bankruptcy to funds that assist former Enron employees who were so badly hit from this financial fiasco, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH. These funds also provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.

It is now known that you personally gained $100 million off of Enron stock, while many Enron employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy.  Enron also profited from the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, thousands of consumers are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the employees to buy it.  You must know, in your heart, that this is truly unfair, unjust and unethical.  But there is something you can do to help make things right: please donate this money to funds set up to help repair the lives of Americans hurt by Enron's misdeeds.  I think it's the least you can do.

Thanks for your time.

Sincerely,

Keri Lynch
