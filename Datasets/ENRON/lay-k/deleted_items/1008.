To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to demand that you disgorge the millions of dollars you intentionally made from fraudulently selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy, to funds such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.  You are a disgrace to the human race and I hope that you and your kind suffer the kind of punishment you really deserve.

While you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it. You are disgusting. It seems to me that anyone who is so in the grip of out-of-control GREED as you and the others of your kind in this country, e.g., Bush, Cheney, Lott, etc., are actually mentally ill.  No other explanation suffices.  It would be in your best interests to donate your ill-gotten gains to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

With contempt,

Ann McGarry
