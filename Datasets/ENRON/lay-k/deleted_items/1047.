To Mr. Ken Lay,

In the interest of saving your own soul (not to mention the ability to sleep at night) I urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock to such funds as the Enron Employee Transition Fund.  I recommend that you encourage your fellow executives to do the same.  Whether you are religious or not, karma is a very real force in this universe.   God or no god, your actions will have consequences for both you and the nation for decades into the future. The world, and possibly the afterworld, demand your repentence.  Do you really want to go to Hell?

If there is a shred of honor in your life, you will make amends for selling $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

You're a smart man and you can still make other millions to fund your retirement.

Sincerely,

Gordon Wiltsie
