To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing this email to strongly suggest that you donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings. Enron and you made millions out of the savings of your employees.

As I'm sure you know, while you made well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings. That is the only MORAL thing to do. As a Christian, I strongly sufggest you look into your heart and do this.??Sincerely,??Mark Brandl
