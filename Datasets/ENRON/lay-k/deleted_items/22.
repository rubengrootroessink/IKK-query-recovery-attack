To Mr. Ken Lay,

Please tell you wife to stop telling the news media that you are "broke".  With assets totaling over 20 million dollars, how can you claim you are broke?  Do you or your wife go without food, shelter or clothing? Do you wonder where your next meal is coming from?  I think NOT!!

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.
The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Earl Kelly
