To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to insist that you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings.

Sincerely,

Jamie McGloin-King
