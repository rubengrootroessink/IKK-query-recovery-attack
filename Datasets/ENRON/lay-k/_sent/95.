Hi Mr. Grady -

I did talk to Joe Hillings this morning, who is currently in Philadelphia, 
and he said that is great for you to attend.  In addition, I did talk to Ken 
and he said "absolutely", so please plan on it.

Ken and Linda will arrive in Philadelphia tomorrow night.

See you in September.

Rosalee

Ken:

Greetings from the GOP Convention.  I notice on my master schedule that
Enron is hosting a cocktail party on Wednesday from 5 to 7.  I was wondering
two things:

1.  Is it alright if I come by, as a member of the Advisory Committee?  And,

2.  Will I see you there?

Hope all is well and that I will see you in Philadelphia.
I am staying at the Sheraton University City as a member of the California
delegation. 215-222-2910.  I am also wearing my Blackberry for 24 x 7 real
time wireless email access.

Regards,

Bob
