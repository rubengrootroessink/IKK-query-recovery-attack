Hi Mr. Ramsay -

In regard to your request for Ken to chair a Forum segment and join the 
Ministerial dinner, with the Chair of the other Session in May, he said that 
he would be delighted to participate.

We look forward to receiving additional information after the Governing Board 
has its meeting.

Rosalee
