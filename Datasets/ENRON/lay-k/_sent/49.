Hello to all,
Attached please find the agenda for Wednesday's board meeting.  Please review 
it and come to the meeting with ideas and suggestions.  If you have not done 
so already, please let me know if you will be there.  Again, the meeting is 
Wednesday, 5/17/00 at 1:30 in EB49C4.  We have scheduled the room until 3:00 
but I will aim to have you out of there in an hour.

See you there,
Jeff
