Subject: for Rosalee - re Mr. Lay's participation at IEA ministerial


Rosalee -- I just wanted to follow up to see if there are any further
questions you (or Mr Lay) have had with regard to the OECD FORUM and IEA
Ministerial sessions scheduled for 15-16 May here in Paris.  The schedule is
as I sent it to you in April -- although there may be some changes with the
events at the Ministerial dinner.  Here, while we are still intending that
Mr. Lay provide a summary of the FORUM session to the ministerial
participants, we may need to re-order the dinner agenda slightly to
accommodate Secretary Abraham's schedule.  We will keep you posted.

I would also appreciate receiving a copy of the CV that you sent to the OECD
for our own files; we are trying to compile a full set of all participants
for use during the sessions.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Best wishes,

Jonathan Pershing
