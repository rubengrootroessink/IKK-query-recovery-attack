Hi Philippe -

Ken asked me to request that you call the above referenced gentleman.  He was 
referred by a friend of Ken's.  He wants to see if his oil on-line business 
is a fit for us.  Ken said he has no idea whether it will work or not, but 
please give him a courtesy call.

Steve Hellman at 212-628-7191 or cell phone 917-623-9730.

Thanks.

Rosie
