Dick, I don't know if we answered this for you or not, but I'm sure it will 
be fine for you to draft a letter for Ken's signature.

Subject: Indian Prime Minister visit to Houston

Ken,

Received communications from the Texas Department of Economic Development and 
the Indo-American Chamber of Commerce.  Both would like to invite PM Vajpayee 
to Houston during his U.S. visit in September.  The last time that we had a 
PM here was in '94 with PM Rao.  I would like to support this action and 
would recommend that we draft a letter for your signature.  Have discussed 
same with Joe Sutton and have his support.

Dick
