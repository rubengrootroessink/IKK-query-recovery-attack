ENERGY AFRICA LOOK TOWARD THE MOROCCAN DEEP
Rabat - This week the MENA Petroleum Bulletin spoke with Andrew Windham,
Group General Counsel for Energy Africa. Amina Benkhadra, General Manager of
ONAREP (25%) added to the growing list of re-entrants to Morocco, signing a
petroleum agreement with Energy Africa (63.75%) and Taurus Petroleum AB
(11.25%). This agreement, taking effect March 1st 2001, concerned three
exploration permits offshore Morocco collectively known as the Tiznit
Offshore area.
Energy Africa Morocco Ltd (operator), together with Taurus Petroleum
(co-partner) will implement exploration work on the three permits of the
Tiznit Offshore area covering approximately 6000sq.km. This is Energy
Africa's second Petroleum Agreement covering acreage offshore Morocco, the
first being the Cap Draa Haute Mer area where Energy Africa holds 20% equity
bringing the total acreage held by it in the country to 18,000sq.km.
Andrew Windham, said, 'the country has all the characteristics offshore
which make potentially, for substantial discoveries. But at this stage it is
very much untried and untested, so it is a very exciting place to be at the
moment. We are in right at the start of some new plays.'
For further details please see the April issue of the MENA Petroleum
Bulletin.


REPSOL MAKE 2ND LIBYA DISCOVERY
London - Repsol YPF SA said it discovered oil at a second well during
exploration in Libya. The well in the Murzuq Basin, 800km south of Tripoli,
produced oil at a rate of 1,300bbl/d, the company said in a press release.
Repsol is testing the site on behalf of a consortium including OMV,
TotalFinaElf and Saga Petroleum. Repsol began searching for oil in the area
in May 1998, when the Libyan government granted approval for exploration and
production sharing arrangements with foreign companies. The companies
currently produce more than 160,000bbl/d from the Murzuq Basin, said the
company.


AHMED ABDELKARIM CONFIRMED AS NEW HEAD OF NOC
Tripoli - Further to reports this week from Libya Ahmed Abdel-Karim Ahmed
has been formally appointed as Chairman of NOC, following reports that he
had been removed from the position. Representing Libya at the OPEC
conference in Geneva it was confirmed that Al-Badri has been appointed as
Deputy Prime Minister for Social Security. The news will comfort foreign
investors who feared that further upheaval would hinder an already slow
ratification process, with approvals outstanding for three packages of
blocks offered by NOC in late 2000.

*****MARKET ANALYIS REPORT NEWS*****

ALGERIAN OIL AND GAS REPORT
Approximately 90% of Algeria's crude oil exports go to Western Europe, with
Italy as the main market followed by Germany and France. Algeria accounts
for one-quarter of EU gas imports. With the de-regulation and liberalisation
of the European gas market, Algeria is ideally located to meet the gas
demands of Iberia and the Eastern Mediterranean Basin. This will depend upon
the degree to which foreign investment can be attracted.
This Report provides a comprehensive examination of the oil and gas industry
in Algeria, and the prime and potential markets for Algerian energy
products. Specifically, the Report will provide you with a complete analysis
on
* All major oil and gas field/projects.
* Southern European gas demand forecasts
* Corporate Directory
* BP Amoco's natural gas strategy
* Country Risk Analysis
The Report is essential reading for exploration and production, business

sector. For further information please visit

MENA POWER
23 & 24th April 2001, Crowne Plaza Hotel, Dubai
For further information visit
http://www.smi-online.co.uk/middleeastpower2.asp

The timing of this conference couldn't be better as the Middle East and
North African region gears up to offer further independent power projects.

SMi forthcoming conference titled Middle East North African Power, taking
place 23rd and 24th April 2001 aims to bring together all levels of
participants to explain their understanding and thinking for the future of
Middle East and North African power development.

Many countries experience blackouts and electrical faults on a daily basis,
governments in the Middle East and North Africa are now increasingly pinning
their hopes on the Independent Power Project run in conjunction with major
International investors to solve this problem.   Relaxation of Middle East
law has allowed outside investment and many see this moving the Middle East
power industry towards privatisation.

Key Speakers at this event include:
* Engineer Mahmoud Al-Ees, Head of Planning Studies, Ministry of Energy and
Mineral Resources - Jordan
* Dr Ranald Spiers, Regional Director Middle East & Africa, National Power
Plc
* Steve Wildman, Commercial Director, Alstom Gas Turbines
* Tom Thomason, Project Manager, InterGen
* Daniel J. Meier, Area Sales Manager, ABB High Voltage Technologies
* Dr Thomas Stauffer, International Oil and Finance Consultant (Formerly
with M.I.T)

MENA Power takes place on 23rd & 24th April 2001 at the Crowne Plaza Hotel,
Dubai.  The full conference programme is available at

http://www.smi-online.co.uk/algeria.asp

The Aims & Objectives of the Conference

Algeria has always attracted a large amount of interest from the
international oil and gas community.  With a new licensing round under
discussion and petroleum code under review, this conference aims to act as a
forum for all aspects of the oil and gas industry to come together and
discuss the future development of Algeria's oil and gas sector.  Moving away
from the traditional investing in format of conference, this forum aims to
look at specific field studies and also the future markets and developments
within the Algerian oil and gas industry.  It will focus on the commercial
opportunities that exist in helping Algeria reach these markets and allow
for strategic analysis of the impact of this supplier.  It will examine
current MENA energy flows and how they might look in the future with Algeria
asserting its role as the Mediterranean's major producing nation.

discuss your participation in more detail, please contact Wendy Parker the
conference organiser on the numbers below.
