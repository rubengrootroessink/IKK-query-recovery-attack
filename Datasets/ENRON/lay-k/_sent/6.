We're sorry the web site address embedded in the email we sent you yesterday 
contained an error.  Please try again using the revised address shown in the

Thank you


Dear Kenneth L. Lay:

Great news!  Your copy of 'Strategy & Business' issue 18 is in the mail.  
This quarter's edition is our first double-issue, and offers 'Strategy & 
Business' subscribers a powerful reality-check on the single most important 
topic on the CEO Agenda today - E-Commerce.

Not so great news!  This issue of 'Strategy & Business' may be your last.  
Postal and audit regulations strictly limit the number of complimentary 
copies we can serve.  Recently we emailed you to ask for confirmation that 
you would like to continue your subscription. If you have not already done so 
please do so now by visiting our Subscriber Services Center at 
http://www.sbsubscriber.com/services/cg.cfm?D=20000119143223&N=830487732&R=207
.0 and following the simple instructions there.  It will only take a few 
moments, and will insure that you don't miss a single issue of the magazine 
that brings you the Best Ideas in Business.

Sincerely

Bev Chaloux
Circulation Director
