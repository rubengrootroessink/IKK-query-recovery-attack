Mexico Meeting 2000
Managing New Expectations and Old Challenges
Mexico City, Mexico 4-5 December

Dear Dr Lay,

Mexico awoke to a new political landscape on 2 July 2000. The economic and 
business climate is positive and full of new opportunities as Mexico finally 
completes a long transition from one-party dominance to pluralist democracy, 
adding political maturity to a more competitive market economy.

In light of the above, the World Economic Forum will hold a Mexico Meeting 
2000 on 4-5 December in Mexico City. Held in collaboration with the Mexican 
Investment Board, this gathering will take place three days after the 
inauguration of the new Mexican administration. We have already received 
confirmation that President-elect Vicente Fox and Mexican Central Bank 
Governor Guillermo Ortiz will participate. We are also expecting the presence 
of the future key cabinet members and state governors.

As usual, the World Economic Forum pulls together the right group of leaders 
to discuss issues, build a network of contacts and identify where future 
business opportunities and risks lie. The Meeting will focus on four main 
topics: the country's political and social agenda, Mexico's commercial 
relationships with the rest of the world, the new economy and the key issues 
for the country's main industries.

Please consult our website, http://www.weforum.org/mexico, where information 
will be updated as soon as it becomes available.
