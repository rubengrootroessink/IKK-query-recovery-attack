Mr. Lay,
?
Your assistant contacted me a couple weeks back with the message that the  
attached was not an opportunity you could consider at this time.? Thanks  
very much, though, for taking a look at it.
?
I have one follow-up question for you -- could you recommend another Enron  
executive that might be a candidate for such an opportunity?? 
?
To help you answer the question, the company is Juno Online?Services,  
Inc.?(NASDAQ: JWEB), a leading US ISP.? Juno is very interested in  working 
with (and in advanced-stage discussions with) companies in the energy  
industry and working with them on strategic telecommunications and marketing  
partnerships.
?
Information about Juno is available at "About Juno" on Juno's Web site 
http://www.juno.com.? I've also attached an  executive summary to update you 
(or the relevant person at Enron) as to the  current status of Juno's 
business.
?
Thanks very much for your assistance, and I hope that this message finds  you 
well.
?
Best,
?
Toby

Executive Overview of?Juno --

The company finished 4Q00 w/ $56MM in cash.? Total net loss for 2001  was 
projected to be $10-$25MM, as the company focuses on billable services,  
continues to reduce expenses, and looks to develop advertising and other  
ancillary revenue streams.? The company is confident that it can meet  
or?beat the loss target and made explicit statements that on-hand cash  
resources are "more than adequate" to get the business profitable.? The  
company has not publicly given a time-line for profitability to maintain  
flexibility.  
The company controls one of the largest dialup subscriber audiences (4MM  
active subscribers as of 4Q00, 850K of whom are billable) on the Internet  
today and is the 4th largest US ISP (after AOL, ELNK, and MSN).  
2000 revenue came in at $114MM, 65% of which was derived from subscription  
fees and 35% from advertising.? 2001 revenues are expected to come in  
between $100MM-$120MM, with the revenue mix moving toward 80% subscription 
and  20% advertising due to increased focus on billable services and the 
soft  Internet advertising markets.  
Juno has announced broadband agreements for its Juno Express product  
covering all mainstream broadband transport platforms -- AT&T Broadband,  
Time Warner Cable, and Comcast (cable); Covad (DSL); Hughes (satellite); and  
Metricom (wireless).  
The company has announced wireless distribution agreements for it's Juno  
Mobile product with Palm and Sprint PCS.? Other agreements are likely to  be 
forthcoming.  
The company has powerful propietary technology assets that give it a  
competitive advantage.? The company has launched (internally but not  
publicly) a new business unit -- Juno Solutions -- to investigate the  
opportunity to license these technology assets to third parties both  
domestically and internationally.?  
The Juno Virtual Supercomputer Project represents another example of  Juno's 
efforts to develop ancillary revenue streams.? This distributed  computing 
initiative aims to leverage unused computer processing power from  Juno's MMs 
of subscribers, aggregating it for sale to biotech, pharmaceutical,  and 
computational chemistry firms.?
