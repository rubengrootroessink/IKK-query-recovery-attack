Roger:

I appreciate the brief e-mail concerning The Continental article.  It turned 
out to be a nice article.

I have been in and out of London in recent weeks but not there for any 
extended stay.  I believe my next extended stay in London will be this Fall.  
I will attempt to come by and check your products out.

My very best to you.

Ken

Privet! Kenneth

I have just finished reading the article in Continental ,hence the Russian
greeting .

You look in good health , or is it the skills of the make-up artist ,the
former I hope .

Will you be making a stop in England ?.

Do skoroi vstrechi .

Roger
