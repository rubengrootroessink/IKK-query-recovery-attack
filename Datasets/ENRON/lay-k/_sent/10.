Rosalee, please throw away the earlier e-mail as it
appears someone, meaning Jose Luis, didn't check their
references.
Thanks
Liz

I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but this is a hoax:

http://urbanlegends.about.com/culture/urbanlegends/library/blemtax2.htm

Here's an excerpt from the U.S. Postal Service's published response:

A completely false rumor concerning the U.S. Postal Service is being
circulated over the Internet via e-mail.
The e-mail message claims that a "Congressman Schnell" has introduced "Bill
602P" to allow the federal government to impose a 5-cent surcharge on each
e-mail message delivered over the Internet. The money would be collected by
Internet Service Providers and then turned over to the Postal Service.

No such proposed legislation exists. In fact, no "Congressman Schnell"
exists.
