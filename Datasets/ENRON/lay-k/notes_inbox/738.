Dear Mr.s Lay and Skilling

Thank you; I just received my t-shirt and letter regarding the Chairman's 
award nomination.  I was really flattered to have received that mention.  The 
traits sought by the Chairman's award are those I would really like to 
exemplify; respect, communication, integrity, and excellence.  To even have 
been considered worthy is exciting and humbling.  I know that truly most 
people at Enron hope to display these values, and for you to have designed an 
award to recognize them is really inspiring.

In short, it meant a lot to me, to have been mentioned for the Chairman's 
award within a company of which I am so proud.  I know it will mean a great 
deal to the person I will seek to nominate, when I next have the opportunity.

Thank you.
Sincerely,
Julia Cobb
