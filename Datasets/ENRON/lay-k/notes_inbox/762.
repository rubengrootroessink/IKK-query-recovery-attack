The National Bureau of Asian Research (NBR) is pleased to announce
the establishment of a moderated Japan-U.S. email Discussion Forum.
With full support and funding from the Japan-U.S. Friendship
Commission, NBR has launched an electronic discussion forum for
those interested in issues surrounding Japanese politics, economics,
and security, and U.S.-Japan relations.  This new forum will provide
an opportunity for in-depth and focused discussion and exchange of
information and ideas among individuals who seek to further their
understanding of contemporary Japanese affairs.  While the forum will
be open to all who wish to participate, it will be moderated to ensure
appropriate, relevant discussion.  Dr. Edward G. Griffin, former State
Department officer, serves as the moderator.

To subscribe, please visit the forum home page at
http://lists.nbr.org/japanforum and click on the "subscribe" link in the
upper left-hand corner.

NBR is a nonprofit, nonpartisan institution that conducts advanced
research on policy-relevant issues in Asia.  It also serves as the
global clearinghouse for Asia research conducted by specialists and
institutions worldwide through its program AccessAsia.
