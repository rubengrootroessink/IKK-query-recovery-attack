Hello everyone.
?
Chris Davis has sent me a formal letter  of resignation from the Compaq 
Board.? As you all know, Chris and I had  discussed her schedule and the 
difficulty she was having balancing?her time  between her new position, the 
cross country? move and her desire to be a  fully involved board member.? 
?
I will be sending Chris a note from the  board, but it might also be a good 
idea if some of you dropped her a  note.
?
Lucie

TO:????  ??????? Lucie Salhany  
???????  ??????? Chairman,  Corporate Governance Committee  
???????  ??????? Compaq  Computer Corporation 

FROM:??  ??????? Chris A. Davis 

SUBJECT:???????  Resignation from the Compaq Board of Directors 

DATE:??  ??????? September 28, 2000 

??????? You may  have seen that ONI Systems filed today for a follow-on 
common stock offering and  a convertible debt offering.? As a result of these 

financings and the associated activities, attending  the September and 
October Compaq Board meetings would not be possible.? In  addition, as you

know, since accepting my current position at ONI  Systems, the company's 
requirements on my time have made it difficult for me to  be as proactively

involved with Compaq as I feel a board member should  be. 

??????? Therefore,  I believe it is in our mutual best interest that I submit 
my resignation from  the Board effective September 25,  2000.???????? I 
certainly enjoyed  

my involvement with the Board and I appreciate the  Board's understanding of 
my decision.
