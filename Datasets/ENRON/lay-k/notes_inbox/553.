Hi Ken,
    It was great to talk with you at the recent Fortune Roundtable on New
Economy Philanthropy.  As I mentioned at the evening banquet, we are
currently creating the Houston Social Venture Partners.  Attached is an
initial Power Point presentation to inform you of our progress.  I would
appreciate the opportunity to visit with you to obtain your suggestions.  We
are very excited about the potential for Houston of the Houston Social
Venture Partners.  We are following the structure similar to the successful
organizations in Austin [asvp.org] and Seattle [svpseattle.org]. presented in
the lecture by David Lunsford at the Roundtable.
    Please advise me of convenient times in your schedule for us to meet.
                     Thank you
