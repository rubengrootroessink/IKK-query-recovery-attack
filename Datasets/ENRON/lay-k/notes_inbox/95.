Ken, thanks very much on both counts.  Be assured that we will be in touch
w/ Rosalee and, if desired, you personally to take care of the details re.
the professorship announcement and the keynote talk.

Thank you so much.  We are deeply grateful to you.

Dear Dean Walker -

Ken Lay asked me to respond to you re:

1) Naming the new professorship the Pinkney C. Walker Distinguished Teaching
Professorship - this is fine.
2) He will be pleased to serve as the keynote speaker for the banquet on
October 13.

Thanks.

Rosalee
