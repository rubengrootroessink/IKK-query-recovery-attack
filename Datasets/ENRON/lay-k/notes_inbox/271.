To the attention of:
Dr Kenneth L. Lay
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
ENRON CORPORATION

Dear Dr Lay,

While it appears that the US economy is moving towards the much-talked
about 'soft-landing', there are nevertheless imbalances - particularly the
severe shortage of labor and surging trade deficit - which have given
global business leaders reason to be wary. Add to this scenario the new
political landscape, and the recent hike in oil prices, and there is every
reason to pay close attention to the USA in early 2001.

Taking place within the first 100 days of the new Administration, the USA
Meeting 2001 will bring together key members of the cabinet and
congressional leadership, several hundred chief executives from over forty
countries, as well as renowned experts and media leaders. In our usual
Davos-style interactive discussions, we will analyse the current state of
the world's largest market against the backdrop of the global economy.

Held in collaboration with the National Chamber Foundation, the USA Meeting
takes place at the headquarters of the US Chamber of Commerce, across from
the White House. The Meeting is widely recognised as the premier Washington
event for business leaders from the United States and around the world.

A full brochure will be sent to you after the election but wanted to take
the opportunity to inform you at this early stage so you can already block
April 4-5, 2001 on your agenda. I hope that I will have the pleasure of
welcoming you in Washington, DC next April, and look forward to hearing
from you soon.

For further information, please do not hesitate to contact Chantal
Humbert-Droz at (41 22) 869 1442 or e-mail: usameeting@weforum.org. You may

Yours sincerely,

Frederic Sicre
Managing Director, Regional Strategies
World Economic Forum
