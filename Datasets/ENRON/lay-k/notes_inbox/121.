I recently had the privilege to attend a speech given by Gene Kranz, who was 
in charge at NASA for many space flight missions, including the disastrous 
Apollo 13 mission.  He has written a book called "Failure is not an Option".  
He speaks of teamwork, discipline and approaching the unexpected with an 
attitude that excludes failure.  In short, his speech was great!

I don't know if/where this sort of speaker would be helpful to Enron, but I 
wanted you to know about him.  Volunteer Houston brought him to town, so I'm 
sure they know how to get a hold of him.  I realize he is not a corporate 
organization expert, but he's one heck of a motivational speaker.  Hope this 
is helpful.
