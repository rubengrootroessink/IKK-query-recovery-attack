We need a utility/energy company referral.

We are an early stage e-commerce company that offers the
world's largest selection of wildlife merchandise. We are ready
to obtain our first round of financing.  We would like
to have 5 co-branding partners who would receive equity positions in
our company.  We would incorporate their logo throughout our site and
include their PR materials with each order shipped.  Target partners
would include the utility and energy companies.  Since your
company is active in this market, you may know of someone who can assist
us.

We see utility/energy companies as a compatable fit because of their
interest in projecting a positive wildlife/environmental image.

About our company:

WildlifeCollectibles.Com is a specialty catalog company featuring
wildlife merchandise.  We have the world's largest selection of wildlife
merchandise.  Currently in the wildlife merchandise niche
there are no entities offering broad merchandise selections for each
animal specie.  We are filling this void by operating 22 "sub-niche"
stores under the WildlifeCollectibles.Com brand.  These 22 storefronts
will represent 105 wildlife species.  Seven of these storefronts are
operational and the backend inventory systems are complete for the other
15.  We are in the process of loading them on the Internet.

One major component not yet installed on our site is our "Facts About
the Specie" page.  We will have reference information available for
every wildlife specie listed on our site.  At present,
there is no central repository of reference material available for most
species.  Britanica.com has reference information available for only 11
species.  This will attract school age children with their parents
tagging along.

We are looking for a total of 5 million dollars.  In order to assist
companies in purchasing an equity position/co-branded arrangement with
us, we are willing to finance their investment.  We will take $25,000.00
a month for 40 months from 5 corporate partners.  This will allow them
to budget the expense through Public Relations or Marketing.

I hope I have given you enough information to understand what
we would like to do, so you can either assist us or point us in the
right direction.  We would pay a commission and provide a small equity
stake in our company to the individual who signs on the utility/energy
companies for us.

Sincerely,
Rudy Socha
