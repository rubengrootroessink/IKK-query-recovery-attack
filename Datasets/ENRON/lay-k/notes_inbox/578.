Dear Gil:

Thank you for requesting information regarding my business.  First I am
pleased to be a new member of the US-Mexico Chamber of Commerce and look
forward to meeting you and the members.

I am an independent Real Estate Broker under my own name Paula A. McGowan
and
a CIPS (Certified International Property Specialist) located in Colorado
Springs, Colorado.  I have been active in Colorado Real Estate for the past
seven years and marketing Mexico property and assisting US/International
buyers since 1995.

The main purpose of my business is to assist inbound or outbound individuals
or companies who plan to invest or relocate to another country.  This
includes working with international professionals such as real estate
practitioners, attorneys, accountants, lenders or developers on their
behalf.
 I will assist companies wishing to locate production facilities in
Colorado,
Internationally or in Mexico such as the state of Sonora and will inquire
about government incentives to companies willing to relocate.  I also make
referrals to real estate practitioners and professionals in other countries.

I am a member of FIABCI, (The International Real Estate Federation) based in
France which provides me direct access to international real estate contacts
and professionals in over 55 countries throughout the world.  I am also a
member of The National Association of Realtors International, CIPS Network
which is a resource of hundreds of real estate practitioners who specialize
in international property practices throughout the globe. These
organizations
provide our members an avenue where we can market property for clients at
marketing sessions held during US and International conventions.  In
Colorado
I am a member of the Colorado Association of Realtors, the Pikes Peak
Association of Realtors and a member of the Broadmoor Golf Club.

When my parents moved to Mexico in the late 50's, my love of Mexico began.
I
made many trips to visit them, have close friends of 20 years in the Guaymas
area and know many of the business people.  My husband and I reside in San
Carlos, Sonora, Mexico part time.  We have been active in Mexico Senior Golf
Tournaments in Acapulco, Guadalajara and San Carlos during the past 14
years.
 We are past members of the Asociacion Mexicana A.C. De Golf Senior, the San
Carlos Country Club/Club de Golf de Guaymas and I am a member of Los
Recuerdos, a women's organization in San Carlos.

I presently market property in Guaymas, Sonora, Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca, a
home in Guadalajara and a 320 acre ranch in Valle De Bravo, Mexico.  These
properties can be seen on my website at <A

Please feel free to contact me if I can be of help to you or the members.

Best Regards,

Paula A. McGowan, CIPS
