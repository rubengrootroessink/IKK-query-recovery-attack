Dear Mr. Lay:

Here is the new Service Provider version of our white paper as promised. I'd
like to know what you think. Please forward to the appropriate members of
your staff.

We'd like to help in any way we can. We'd like to schedule a conference call
with your staff at your earliest convenience to discuss your VPN needs.

Sincerely,
Simon Stokes
Director of Sales

Dear Mr. Lay:

Here's the newly completed Enterprise version of our white paper, and the
Service Provider version is being finished now. I'll send that along as soon
as it's ready.

After you and your associates read it, I think you'll discover that we
provide a VPN tool that eases provisioning of Nortel Contivity, Cisco IOS,
Altiga and PIX, as well as VPN management and security policy auditing. This
would compliment your existing solutions and greatly expand your ability to
penetrate the market with your product offering.

Let me know technical questions you come up with and I'll get our CTO to
answer them for you.

Sincerely,
Simon Stokes

Subject: TBD Networks VPN Initiative


Dear Mr. Lay:

Because you were recognized Business Week in 1999  for "taking Enron into
the red-hot communications industry" by "developing an intelligent network
platform to facilitate online business and building a market for trading
bandwidth", we'd like to get your opinion on how we can contribute to your
initiative.

TBD Networks is a Secure VPN Management software company here in Silicon
Valley. We believe Enron could benefit from using our highly scalable
software to manage VPNs Enterprise-wide by:

1) Speeding up the setup and provisioning time for tens of thousands of
VPNs.
2) Uniquely Vendor-Independent: Supporting all types of VPNs (Remote
Access/Site-to-site/Extranet), based on equipment, products and technologies
from Cisco IOS, PIX, Altiga, Nortel and Check Point.
3) Reducing training and support needs by using our easy-to-use, web-based
GUI based on high-level policies, hiding low-level, vendor-specific
interfaces.
4) Providing significantly higher levels of security and control VPNs via
advanced features such as random policy auditing and proactive service
monitoring.

We would be very interested in meeting with someone at Enron to find out how
you would like to proceed. Who would you suggest we contact?

Sincerely,
Simon Stokes
