RLC Increases New Jersey TV Ad Buy 
As Franks-Corzine Race Tightens 
Budget-Busting, Anti-Taxpayer Corzine Issues 
Beginning To Impact Senate Race

?Washington, DC -- The Republican Leadership Council (RLC) announced that it 
will increase its existing New Jersey TV ad buy by an additional $250,000, 
beginning immediately, and will step up efforts to point out the fiscal 
profligacy associated with Democrat Jon Corzine's economic platform. 

?"We're clearly making headway in our effort to educate New Jersey taxpayers 
about the real cost of Corzine's ideas for big government, and we're going to 
turn up the volume of our TV buy in New Jersey," said Mark Miller, Executive 
Director of the RLC.? "The bottom line is that Jon Corzine's irresponsible 
'free lunch' big spending schemes will ruin our economic prosperity, and send 
the nation back into deficit spending." 

?The RLC ad, which will be extended in both the Philadelphia and New York 
markets, charges that Corzine's spending programs would cost the average 
taxpayer $5,000 per year, and quotes a newspaper editorial saying that, 
"Corzine's... schemes would come at a tremendous cost to taxpayers." 

?Meanwhile, a new Quinnipiac College survey of 909 likely New Jersey voters 
released today shows GOP candidate Bob Franks within five points, 46%-41%, 
even after being outspent by Corzine by record margins. 

?Miller noted that the new survey shows Corzine with an unimpressive 30% - 
26% Favorable/ Unfavorable rating overall, and evenly split among 
independents at 26%. 

?"Because Corzine's message is based almost entirely on giving away taxpayers 
dollars for government program after government program, taxpayers are 
looking more skeptically at his proposals," said Miller.? "New Jersey 
taxpayers don't believe Corzine should spend their money as recklessly as he 
spends his own money."
