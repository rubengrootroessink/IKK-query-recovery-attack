Gene and Jim,  incredibly, and just today, I received from my previous law 
firm's home office  in New York your letter dated January 25, 2000 inviting 
me to be one of the 35  participants in the Center for Houston's Future. When 
my previous firm closed  it's Houston offices at the end of last December, 
all mail was collected and  forwarded to New York for sorting and 
redistribution. The mail from January that  should have been sent to me was 
apparently sitting in a corner all these months  in the New York mail room of 
Curtis, Mallet (my previous firm), and was  delivered to me yesterday, 
including your letter. You can imagine what my  reaction was to my previous 
firm's management concerning this nine month delay.  I am most distressed, 
however, to have missed the opportunity to participate in  the Center for 
Houston's Future's endeavors, which I most certainly would have,  and am 
somewhat surprised that my failure to respond to such an important effort  
never came up in conversation among us?--- we've been around each other  
innumerable times since the letter was sent. My apologies to the both of you 
and  to the Board of Directors of the Center. I care deeply about this city 
and  region, and would have felt privileged to have participated. My best to 
the both  of you, Vidal
