It is time for the 3rd quarter Technology Investment Committee (TIC) 
meeting.  I will have my assistant, Rebekah Rushing, contact you to set the 
date, time, and location.

The four groups to be represented are Enron Broadband Ventures, Enron 
NetWorks, Enron North America and Enron Economic Development Partners.  I it 
is my suggestion that we make the meeting 1 hour and allow a max of 15 
minutes to each group.

Thanks,
KG
