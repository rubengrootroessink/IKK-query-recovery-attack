Enron's Image 2000 Video is Now Available

We think you will like Enron's new corporate image video, which can be used 
for employees, customers, suppliers, government officials, and other 
audiences who want to know about Enron.  The video features Ken Lay, Jeff 
Skilling and Joe Sutton who discuss four key business initiatives:  
broadband; wholesale energy; energy outsourcing services and EnronOnline.  
The look and feel represents our people, culture and new branding.
