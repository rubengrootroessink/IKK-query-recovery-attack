It was good to see you again this week.  I talked with Wayne Sanders and Tom
Falk, and we would very much like to get together with you for a meeting in
Dallas possibly in December.  Wayne asked that we include Jeffrey Skilling.
I have asked Jeanine Jankowski, my assistant, to help arrange the meeting in
Dallas.  Jeanine will be contacting your assistant.
