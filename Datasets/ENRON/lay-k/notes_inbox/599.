******E-NEWS THIS WEEK*******

KVAERNER WINS BALAL AWARD
Tehran - Kvaerner Singapore, part of the Anglo-Norwegian group, has been
appointed detailed engineering contractor for the offshore production
platform in the Balal oil field, being developed by TotalFinaElf. The award
follows Iranian Offshore Engineering and Construction (OIEC) and Singapore's
SembCorp winning the $60m contract for installation of the platform to
process 40,000bbl/d of oil and 14mcfd of associated gas.
The Anglo-Norwegian group was brought in by NIOC subsidiary Petro Pars in
April to manage the first phase development of South Pars gas field. In a
separate development, OIEC and Petro Iran are reported to be looking for a
foreign partner to take a 30% stake in the $850m Salman offshore project,
which the two Iranian companies won in October on a buy-back basis. The
Salman contract, tendered in 1998, requires the rebuilding of war-damaged
facilities and upgrading production at the field by 45,000 bbl/d to 130,000
bbl/d as well as developing an associated gas structure. http://www.irna.com


OPEC TO SUSPEND 20-DAY MECHANISM UNTIL JANUARY
Vienna - OPEC exporters have rejected calls from consuming nations for
further extra crude supplies that would have helped ease stubbornly high
world oil prices and cut fuel bills this winter. It appears, as the
Ministers meet in Austria this month, that OPEC will not be adding further
increases to world supplies despite oil prices remaining outside its
automatic 20-day production increase mechanism, set at $22-28/bbl. 'There
will be no increases this year under any circumstances,' Indonesian Oil
Minister Purnomo Yusgiantoro told awaiting reporters after a two-hour
meeting ahead of the formal ratification of the decision.

SUDAN SIGN EXPLORATION AGREEMENT
Khartoum - Sudan has signed an oil exploration agreement with several local
and international companies for an area in central Sudan, the
government-owned Al-Anbaa newspaper reported on Sunday. 'Sudan has signed a
production agreement...covering prospecting, development and transportation
of oil with Gulf oil companies, the Chinese National Petroleum Corp, Al Than
and Sudapet,' the daily said.
Al-Anbaa said the agreement covered a 75sq.km area on the western bank of
the White Nile, south of the town of Rabak, about 275km south of Khartoum.
The Gulf companies hold a 46% stake in the investment, the Chinese company
has 23%, Al Than also has 23% and Sudapet holds 8%.
Sudan, which produces about 185,000 barrels per day of crude oil, began
crude exports in August 1999. It had previously been importing oil and oil
products for about $300m a year, eating up most of its export earnings. It
has also been reported this week that Talisman Energy are to step up their
exploration efforts in the country, despite opposition from humanitarian
groups.


SHELL INK EGYPTIAN GTL AGREEMENT
Cairo - Royal Dutch/Shell Group confirmed this week that they are to invest
$1.7bn in an Egyptian gas-to-liquids (GTL) plant that could lead the country
to use domestic gas reserves to satisfy its entire oil products market for
more than 50 years.
Egypt is currently an importer of oil products. The oil giant agreed to
initial terms on the deal early in October. Shell said it has now signed a
development protocol with Egyptian General Petroleum for a
75,000-barrel-per-day GTL conversion plant to convert natural gas into
synthetic fuels. Crucially the project is now said to have the backing of
Egyptian Petroleum Minister Sameh Fahmy. Production could be in place by
late 2005, while a plant at the same site producing liquefied natural gas
(LNG) could be up and running earlier, by mid-2004.
