Ken:

I wanted to advise you that, as you and Gene Lockhart have discussed, we made 
a change in our executive team today.  Jim Badum has moved out of the Chief 
Marketing Officer role to assume the new position of Managing Director, 
Strategic Development.  Concurrently, Nick Utton has joined NewPower as 
Managing Director, Chief Marketing Officer.

A copy of our internal organization is attached, and the transition has gone 
very smoothly.  I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have, and can 
be reached at 203-531-0400, ext. 623.

VP, HR, Communications and Administration
