I  am considering options for leaving Scient and thought I'd drop you a 
quick  note.? 
?
Enron?is one of very few organizations in the  world which I admire and think 
will thrive in the long term.? I'd like to  play a role in that success and 
think my background has many of the qualities  which could prove useful.? 
I've attached my resume and would greatly enjoy  starting a dialogue.
?
Regards,
?
Bradley??
