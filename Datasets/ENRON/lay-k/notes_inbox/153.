Dear Ken,

I spoke to Bonnie today regarding the letter I sent you on September
12th.  Bonnie suggested I follow-up that letter with this email.

With only 49 days to the election, we expect to see the oppositions'
advertisements on television and radio and in the mail in the next two
weeks.  It's crucial to our ability to be competitive that we complete
our media buys and print our next two direct mail pieces by October
1st.  If we do, we know that we can win.

Your initial contribution of $100,000 allowed us to do the first direct
mail piece to 250,000 households (a sample was included with the letter
I sent to you on the 12th).  We need to do at least two more of these
mailings for our direct mail effort to be truly effective at a total
cost of $190,000 for both (including postage).

To date, the combined total of contributions to the political campaign
and the public education campaign is just over $1,040,000.  We expect an
additional $150,000 in pledges and new contributions in the next two to
three weeks.  While we are actively soliciting others for help, we are
currently left with a shortfall of $310,000 to meet our minimum budget
of $1.5 million.  (This budget would include the production and mailing
of the three mail pieces described above)

Ken, the campaign is at a crossroads.  I cannot underscore enough how
important your additional financial help is at this time.  And, I cannot
underscore enough how important one last significant contribution from
you would be to our success on November 7th.

If you have any questions, or need additional information, please do not
hesitate to call me at (573) 446-3129 or reply to this email message.

Thank you for your past support and, hopefully, your additional
support.  Passing Proposition A is a once in a generation opportunity.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,

Karl
