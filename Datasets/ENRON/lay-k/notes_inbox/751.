Ken,

In my pre-Enron life, I taught history (years and years ago).  

Recently, while culling files in preparation for moving from EB to 3AC,  I 
came across a pamphlet about the origins of the Transwestern Pipeline Company 
and found it very interesting - for the second or third time.

In particular, I am impressed by the vision these pioneers had.  My concern 
is that our Enron preserve some record of those early people and days of the 
entities that make up the bigger Enron.  They were awesome.

In another pre-Enron segment of my life, I worked for a rare and out-of-print 
book dealer.  One of the collections we worked hard to accumulate and then to 
sell as a collection was a group of business histories.  The collection was 
snapped up the first month we put it on the market.  Great business stories 
go on and on being researched by and inspiring new generations of 
entrepreneurs.

Not having practiced my craft as historian for many years, I am no longer 
familiar with the important names in historical writing (except for popular 
historians such as Stephen Ambrose).  If Enron doesn't already have a 
historian, we need an established writer of substantial stature - someone 
whose produced work would reach a lot of people.  

Maybe someone from the Rice University staff could point the way?  Or, maybe 
even someone from Rice has the qualities needed to produce an exciting 
history of Enron.

Because ours is such a great story, I would like to see a project such as 
this pursued.  I would like to know what you think about this suggestion.

Thanks for letting me send this your way.

Vera Jones, ETS Project Control
