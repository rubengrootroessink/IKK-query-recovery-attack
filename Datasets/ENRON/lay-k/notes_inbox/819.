Hi, Ken,

Nice to see you again this morning in the lobby.  It's always a pleasure to 
enjoy your courtesy.  

Three years ago, you helped me get into Enron.  I am still immensely 
grateful.  It has been a fabulous experience.  Now, Azurix is releasing me;  
my last day is 31 DEC 2000.  I'm looking for a new position at Enron.  
Barring that, I take a standard severance package on 01 JAN 2001 and go 
overboard.  I'm taking the typical aggressive Enron approach to networking, 
so if you are aware of something, I'd appreciate knowing.  I'll be over to 
see Stan Horton this afternoon at 16:00.  

I've continued to hone my skills, and provide leadership and creativity in 
difficult circumstances.  
I know Enron is changing.  I'm willing to change (and learn!) with it.  
There's a lot I can do for Enron.  I'd just like to have a shot at it.  

Hope the holidays are joyous and safe for you and Linda and your entire 
family.

Best regards,

J. Paul
