Mr. Chairman,
?
Archer's ex son in law is contacting him to see if  he do a spot similar to 
what the President did for us in 1996. We can cut the  spot at Archer's 
convenience and he will have total script approval,  obviously.
?
I am preparing a poll memorandum showing that this  will not kill him with 
Republicans, especially younger Republicans, so he has  nothing to fear.
?
I will also send him a copy of the President's spot  from '96.
?
I understand that Jordan is trying to contact  Archer also.
?
Anything that you could do to encourage Archer to  consider this will be of 
great help. We didn't poll on Archer...but I know his  support will have a 
tremendous impact on the Westside and we need  that.
?
