Tax Foundation's 63rd National Conference
Thursday, November 16, 2000
Four Seasons Hotel, Washington, DC


Corporate Tax Shelters

I would like to invite you and any interested parties to attend the Tax
Foundation's 63rd National Conference, "Corporate Tax Shelters."

The goal of the conference is to give a balanced view of the issue from the
perspective of the Administration, Capitol Hill, the Judiciary, and tax
practitioners.  It will also examine corporate tax shelters and distinguish
the line that defines them as either legitimate business transactions or tax
shelters.  Speakers include:
Secretary Lawrence H. Summer, Department of the Treasury
Judge David Laro, U.S. Tax Court
Professor Ronald Pearlman, Georgetown University
Kenneth Kies, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
Mark Prater, Majority Chief Tax Counsel, Senate Committee on Finance
Russ Sullivan, Minority Chief Tax Counsel, Senate Committee on Finance
Timothy Hanford, Majority Tax Counsel, House Committee on Ways and Means.
If you are interested in attending this year's conference please open,
