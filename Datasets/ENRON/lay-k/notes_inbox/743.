For years I followed the positive contributions ENRON made to the community 
and its staff.  I always dreamed of working for a company that truly cared.  
My prayers were answered.  I am proud to be a part of this team and look 
forward to many years of prosperity and success.  After working for a private 
practice for 10 years and being told that the corporate work environment was 
impersonal, I have seen ENRON promote and display respect, integrity, 
communication and excellence.  If someone gives respect, the person receiving 
it might build up their self-esteem and in return respect others.  Being 
honest gains trust and sometimes trust can be more valuable than money.  
Without communication, walls are built and eventually tumble down hurting 
everyone/everything surrounding them.  I really applaud your vision on 
communication.  Good communication is the main ingredient in every view of 
life.  Keep up the good work.  Striving for excellence encourages people to 
work hard, utilize their creative minds, explore new areas, and learn to 
adjust to change.  

Thank you again for allowing me to be a part of such a GREAT team.
