Text from Scott McNealy's letter:

I would like to ask for your support in completing an executive customer 
survey. Sun Microsystems conducts this survey with key decision-makers in our 
top customer organizations. It will provide us with valuable feedback and 
areas for improvement regarding our customers' expectations.

This web survey is administered by Burke Customer Satisfaction Associates, an 
independent third party survey company. The survey requires approximately 10 
minutes of your time to complete.

Within a few days, you will receive an e-mail from Burke with the appropriate 
URL to access the survey.  Your response is very important, so if you are 
unable to respond via the web, Burke will follow-up with a telephone call to 
complete the survey.

Shortly after the surveys are completed, your Sun account team will review 
the feedback we received from your company and discuss resulting action plans 
to better meet your needs.  Thank you in advance for your time and 
consideration.

Sincerely,

Scott G. McNealy
Chairman and CEO
Sun Microsystems, Inc.
