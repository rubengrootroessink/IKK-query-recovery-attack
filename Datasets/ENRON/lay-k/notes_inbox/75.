Attached is the private placement memorandum for nCUBE.  I will be
e-mailing you additional information shortly.  I told Larry Ellison last
night of our conversation and he is estatic that you are considering
joining us on the board of the company.

By the way, with respect to AZX, I have been thinking of ways of

water in fact is a scarce resource, either due to the availability or
infrastructure for deliver, perhaps water "value" can be tiered with
different risk/reward relationships per each tier.  Just a thought.
