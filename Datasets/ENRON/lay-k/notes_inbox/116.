Mayor Vera Katz and the Portland Classical Chinese Garden cordially invite
you to help celebrate the opening of Lan Su Yuan,
the Garden of Awakening Orchids at the

Ribbon Cutting Ceremony

on Thursday, September 14, 2000

After years of planning and months of meticulous construction, we are ready
to unveil what is sure to become one of Portland's proudest landmarks.

The ceremony will be hosted by Mayor Katz with honored guests His Excellency
Li Zhaoxing, Chinese Ambassador to the U.S., and Suzhou Mayor Chen Deming.

Following the ceremony, the garden will be open to the public at the regular
admission prices ($6.00 adults / $5.00 seniors and students).

We hope to see you there!
