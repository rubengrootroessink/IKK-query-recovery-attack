In my summer update about the acquisition of MG Plc and the integration of=
=20
the metals business into Enron, I reported that we were aiming to complete=
=20
the integration by the end of the year. I am pleased to report that we are=
=20
well on the way to meeting this target. =20

September was a busy month for the metals business as it brought with it bo=
th=20
the co-location of the London and Tokyo-based metals staff with Enron=01,s=
=20
offices and the first quarter of combined reporting under Enron Europe. =20
Ensuring a smooth transition for both the metals staff and the metals syste=
ms=20
into our London headquarters took a tremendous amount of co-ordination by=
=20
teams across the company on the part of the former MG team and the=20
integration team at Enron Europe.  Nevertheless, =01&D-Day=018 arrived with=
 minimal=20
problems and the metals team open for business as usual on the morning of=
=20
September 18th. =20

Another key initiative that commenced during September was the re-positioni=
ng=20
of the MG worldwide metals business as Enron Metals. With the exception of=
=20
the Henry Bath & Son Limited warehousing division, which will remain as=20
currently named, the re-branding initiative was kicked off in the UK and=20
followed by Japan and the US.  The re-branding initiative is on going with=
=20
all other remaining regions set to undergo completion of the name change by=
=20
the end of November.

Enron Metals is represented throughout the world.  I have attached a region=
al=20
office summary that depicts Enron Metals=01, locations (Appendix I).

In light of the progress that has been made since the summer, I thought it=

=20
business areas and identify those members of the metals team who will be=20
leading commercial efforts moving forward.=20
