Hi Kenneth, We just saw on TV that Houston, Texas  had a bad storm, did you 
all have any damage?? We saw you on TV the other  day, you looked like you 
are doing well, hope so.How is all of your babies  doing?? Ruby and Edwin 
seemed to be doing better now, Claudine isn't doing  well-seems like she is 
having an awful lot of trouble with blood clots.I think  the rest of us are 
doing pretty good.? Are you going to be in Houston for  Thanksgiving? I guess 
we will have Thanksgiving here at the house for our  immediate family, it 
sure is going to be different without Gwenda. Hope  everything is well with 
you and your family-Tell Linda Hello. Love,  Jenny
