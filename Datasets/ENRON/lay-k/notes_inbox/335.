******E-NEWS THIS WEEK*******

SONATRACH ASK FOR PATIENCE OVER OZ2 PIPELINE CONTRACTS
Algiers - Sonatrach has asked bidders to extend until the end of 2000 offers
made for the $1bn OZ2 pipeline system, designed to extend the capacity of
the crude oil corridor from the central el_hamra oil field to the Arzew
terminal west of Algiers. The extension will allow the company more time to
evaluate the bids
About six companies/groups are understood to be bidding for the three
contracts which are estimated to be worth $220-250m each. They include CCC;
a consortium of Bonatti, with Entrepose and Dragados & Construcciones and
Bechtel. The first two contracts involve the construction of the pipelines
with a third contract for six pumping stations. The recent political changes
in Algeria, combined with internal administrative changes in Sonatrach, are
said to have contributed to the delay.


OIL PRICES RISE OVER ISRAELI CONFLICT
London - Oil prices soared on global markets last night following rising
tensions in the Middle East.
London Brent blend futures rose 72 cents to $31.48 but remains short of a
10-year high $34.98 touched last month. US light crude was up 92 cents at
$32.79 helped by speculators returning to buy oil after a two-week sell-off.
Following Saudi Arabia's warning that Riyadh and other Arab states would not
"watch with their hands tied" if Israel attacked Lebanon or Syria, the cost
of a barrel of crude went up almost a dollar to $32.79 (o22.60) in New York.
Earlier the International Energy Agency set alarm bells ringing when it said
the West was heading into winter with inventories well below the seasonal
norm.
Oil prices have retreated from their 10-year peaks last month after pressure
from the G7 industrial nations on producers to pump more crude and the US
decision to release 30m barrels from its strategic reserve. After briefly
dipping below $30, prices have risen amid concerns that demand will exceed
supply in the coming months, particularly if the violence in Israel leads to
a broader conflict. Oil prices are seen as a threat to the prospects of low
inflation in the West, and yesterday's increases spilled over into bond
markets, where worries about Wall Street and energy shortages had already
driven yields higher.
A wave of violence between Palestinians and Israelis over the past 12 days
has killed at least 90 people, mostly Palestinians.


BUY-BACK TERMS SET TO CHANGE
Tehran - In an interview with Petroleum Argus this month, Mehdi Hosseini,
former Deputy Oil Minister for international Affairs and now Managing
Director at Kala, the procurement arm of NIOC based in London, indicated
that future negotiations with foreign oil companies will take place using
more favourable terms.
NIOC is reportedly close to implementing a more attractive buy-back formula.
Since the Islamic Republic re-opened its doors to foreign oil companies in
1997, executives had quietly bemoaned the buy-back formula as offering small
capital returns on huge investments. Despite this, Iran's energy buy-back
projects have so far attracted close to $10bn capital to the Iranian energy
sector. NIOC argues that it is their duty to negotiate terms favourable to
its population rather than to foreign entities. It now appears that in the
face of increased competition for foreign investment from its Gulf
neighbours, NIOC is prepared to compromise. For further details please visit

TURKIOG' 2000 UPDATE
London - Please be advised that time is running out to register for TURKIOG'
2000 conference in Istanbul on 16th and 17th of November. The event,
supported and endorsed by the Ministry of Energy & Natural Resources, Botas,
Tupras, TPAO, Directorate of Petroleum Affairs and Petkim, has now attracted
in excess of 600 delegates according to the organisers, ITE Exhibitions. The
supporting exhibition has attracted the participation of over 100 companies,
all of whom want to participate at what will prove to be the country's main
oil and gas event of 2000.
