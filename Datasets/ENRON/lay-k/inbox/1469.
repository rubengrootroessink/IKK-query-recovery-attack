Judy called to  let us know that Moritz Craven is doing well following his surgery on  Wednesday.  He's in St. Joseph's hospital and will be moved from ICU to a  room sometime today.  They anticipate he will be released from the hospital  the middle of next week.  Judy said all they need is for us to keep them in our  prayers.
We have sent flowers  (with a few balloons) from the board.  In case you should want it, his  address at the hospital is:
