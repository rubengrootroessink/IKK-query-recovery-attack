Good afternoon!
It is with great sadness that I must inform you that I have resigned from E=
nron. My last day is June 8.  Enron was a wonderful place to work and I hav=
e had so many opportunities to meet quality people.  The most fulfilling ac=
complishment for me is Cougars@Enron.  This group has enabled me a unique e=
xperience in meeting many of you and creating a truly special team. I feel =
there is a real sense of Cougar pride here which made my experience that mu=
ch more pleasurable.  Although I am leaving, Cougars@Enron remains.  We wil=
l elect a new President prior to my departure.  If you show him/her as much=
 enthusiasm and support as you have shown me, the group will flourish to ne=
w heights.   Always remember, it is you that makes this group successful!!!=
  With over 600 of you employed by this company, you make a difference.  It=
 shows in everything we do from one of the (if not the) most successful fir=
st year constituent golf tournament in HAO history/ to the inspiring of Tex=
as A&M to form Aggies@Enron in our image/ to being the envy of other organi=
zed groups.  I am incredibly proud to be a Cougar, not just because of the =
university but the quality of our graduates.  Please keep the faith!  With =
your support we will achieve new heights!  Again, THANK YOU and let's keep =
in contact. Like I said we are Cougars whether we are employed here or else=
 where.  My email address in jeffreymcclellan@zcougars.com.


Jeff

PS:  There will be a happy hour on the 8th. If you would like to come, plea=
se let me know and we will send details.
