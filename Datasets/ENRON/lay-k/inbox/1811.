Rosalee,

Attached are the talking points I've prepared as well as Chairman Greenspan's bio, should Ken wish to review it.  Karen Denne and I will wait outside the Alice Pratt Brown building to be sure Ken gets in without any problem.  As I mentioned on our call earlier, I have spoken to W.O. King and informed him that Linda and Liz would be attending.

Please let me know if there is anything else I can do.
