Mr. Lay, 
On the 28th, the Lord impressed upon me to begin praying over Enron at Enron. My daily prayers started on that first email but I began yesterday to do what people call "prayer walking" and will continue for 16 days. It is based on something I read in 2 Chronicles 29:17 about Hezekiah cleansing the temple. It took a total of 16 days. 
The Lord impressed me to read Psalms 119 yesterday and Mr. Lay, the Lord did NOT condemn you in my heart. It was as if He was telling me of His heart towards you. You know how the Bible tells us that the Holy Spirit will convict us of righteousness too. It was like that. You and I know it is His righteousness but isn't it wonderful that God's heart for you is not accusing. That is the enemy. God does not send the people that are holding up signs and railing accusations. He sends people like me. People that He has given a burden for your needs.
When He first impressed me to do this, I wanted Him to give me scripture that would back this up. I have been taught that you always have to compare what you are thinking back to God's Word. Well, He gave me 1 scripture the first day. 
Galations 6:2  "Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ." 
Then this morning He gave me this one. Now it may not make much sense to you but it is one that the Lord had given me as a personal word for me. It is Isaiah 58 12. The part about "...you will be called Repairer of Broken Walls..."  I know He means that for me to KNOW that He has sent me.
You are my brother in Christ. God has called me to encourage you in this time. God is madly in love with you and wants you to call upon Him NO MATTER what you are feeling. 
I was listening to Tony Evans this morning on a tape and he was talking about who God is. He talked about how God is infinitely powerful, infinitely kind, infinitely everything that is Him..... For God to save you, your company, your employees, is NOT hard for God. With God all things are possible. Read Matthew 17:20, Matthew 19:26, Mark 10:27, and Luke 1:37. 
Let's believe God because He is able and He wants to save. He always wants to save. Even when he humbles us, he only does it so that we will call out to Him and remember that HE ALONE IS GOD. He has made us for HIMSELF. For HIS glory. 
God and God alone has sent me to pray for his mighty hand to deliver. That is what He is constantly confirming to me in scripture. I don't know what it will look like but it will BE GOD and YOU WILL KNOW it. He is not saving for your name but for HIS. 
Mr. Lay, Jeremiah 18:1-12 is something you might need to read. If I really love you as a brother in Christ, I want to remind you that we can NOT be afraid of the hand of the Lord. It is always for our good. You as a man of God know this and I hope you are encouraged that there is ALWAYS HOPE in JESUS. NO MATTER WHAT. This is such an encouraging passage because it tells us that ALL we have to do is turn to God and call on Him. 
I know you must be very weary. I am praying for the employees to supernaturally be productive. For the Lord to knit their hearts together and to minister forgiveness. Not to accuse. 
I haven't read any news yet. Remember I don't have TV or read the newspaper. I am sending this to you without being afraid of what I will read on the internet. 
Great is His faithfulness......

The Joy of the Lord is my strength...
