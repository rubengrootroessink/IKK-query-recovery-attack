I wanted to thank you for taking the time last Thursday to meet with us to
review the activities and Building needs of the College of Biblical Studies.
I think you got a good picture of an organization with tremendous impact on
our City and our society, yet is relatively unknown in the business
community.  Your potential leadership help with this College though your
contribution and the potential Honorary Chair we discussed could be pivotal
in bringing this unique Houston Institution into public view.  I can't think
of another way to bring disparate cultures together more meaningfully, than
to share a common belief in Christ.  We look forward to your prayerful
consideration of our requests.

On another topic, I can't tell you how pleased I was to meet your son.  He
is a wonderful man that you should be quite proud of.  Bonnie and I have  14
, 18, and 20 year old kids.....I can only hope, dream, and pray that they
turn out as well !!!

Thanks for your time and interest .... I think of what your leadership has
meant to your company and this City often, you are a great role model for
many of us.

God Bless,
David Weekley
