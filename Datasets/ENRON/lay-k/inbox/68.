NewPower Conducting Three Innovative Energy-Saving Pilot Programs In Philadelphia To Help Consumers Control Their Energy Costs

PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 31, 2001-- Some 300 Philadelphia households will soon participate in three pioneering pilot programs that will test consumer's reaction to energy saving technology. 

The programs will be launched next month by The New Power Company(TM), a subsidiary of NewPower Holdings, Inc., with technology and services provided by the Carrier Corporation, Shadowpack Inc., Coactive Networks, National Family Opinion Research (NFO) and Sargent Electric Company. 

The three pilots consisting of 100 households each will include: a time-of-use metering pilot; an HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) load control pilot; and an interactive home gateway pilot. The interactive home gateway pilot will allow consumers to remotely access their thermostat from any Internet-enabled device. 

"As NewPower has advocated since its inception, energy restructuring leads to technological innovation, efficiency and environmental benefits,' said H. Eugene Lockhart, The New Power Company's president and chief executive officer.  "These pilots are a wonderful example of control being shifted from the utility to the consumer. The nation's move to energy restructuring makes it possible for consumers to better manage their energy needs."
 
Here are additional details on each of the three pilots: 
?	Participants in pilot program ``A'' will have time-of-use meters installed in their homes. These meters record daily energy use and will enable 		NewPower to better understand typical energy consumption patterns. 

?	In pilot program ``B,'' the HVAC load control pilot, Carrier's Comfortstat(TM) programmable thermostat will be installed in 100 homes. The purpose 	of this pilot is to gauge customers' reaction to having NewPower remotely alter their thermostat setting by 2 to 6 degrees to help the homeowner 		better manage their energy usage and costs. 

?	Under pilot program ``C,'' NewPower's remote energy management system will allow consumers to change their thermostat setting from any 		Internet-accessible device, including a PC, ``smart'' mobile phone or PDA. However, unlike pilot ``B,'' the customer always remains in control and 		may instantaneously override the adjustment at any time from the Web or a wireless device. 

Sargent Electric Company will install and service the energy management systems throughout the duration of the pilot programs. Their professional installers will complete the system installation in a matter of hours and provide helpful user instruction. 

The pilot programs will run from early June to the end of September -- the peak season for energy consumption. Homeowners are currently being recruited by NFO Research, and, as part of the pilot, will be asked to complete a number of short surveys about how they use the system and their feelings about new product concepts. 

Coactive Networks will provide the heart of the interactive home gateway system in pilot ``C.'' This first-of-its-kind technology uses home networking to enable real-time monitoring and control of devices over the Internet without requiring any new wires in the home. Shadowpack has built the system's Web and wireless user interfaces and will provide the back-end infrastructure necessary to carry out customer requests. Shadowpack's services allow for seamless connectivity from almost any Internet accessible device.
