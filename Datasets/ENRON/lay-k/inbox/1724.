I tried to respond to your email below but it came back as undeliverable so I am resending it. I am praying hard so we will recover from our troubles. GOD BLESS ALL OF US.  I would like to thank you personally for all the hard work that you have been doing to save the company. We have faith in you and I know that you are doing your best to keep all your employees intact.

It really hurts whatever is happening to us (ENRON).  Maybe you and the rest of the management group have thought of this already but I still want to give my suggestion just in case it is not being considered as an option.  Can Enron possibly ask Washington DC (our government) to rescue us.  When I was in Pennsylvania I used to work for a railroad company and that company was in trouble for a while and the government gave help.  Now that Railroad is a private sector and making money and is contributing to the state as well as the local communities.

Today was a very difficult day for us as market uncertainty continued.  Recent news reports, including The Wall Street Journal article today, have speculated about possible mergers, takeovers and equity investors as options that Enron is considering.  The reason you have not seen us responding to these reports is that it is our corporate policy not to comment on market speculation.  However, I will tell you that we are evaluating all options to protect the financial stability of this company.  I will keep you updated on developments as they occur.
