Dear Mr. Lay:

You may not actually take time to read this email, but it will make me feel better having sent it.  I started with Enron 2 1/2 years ago in the ENA Volume Management Group.  Even after having 3 managers in the group, my reviews were outstanding, and after 1 1/2 years in the group, I decided to spread my wings.  I wanted to make a difference at Enron and I decided to take a position with Enron Global Markets, a growing and prosperous group at the time.  Once again, I was passed around through various managers, 3 to be exact, however I still received outstanding reviews.  With all of my reviews, always came the promise of being promoted with the next one.  However, with the last mid-year review, my boss knew that the time had come - but he encouraged me to wait until year-end, as my raise and bonus would be much better that way.  I knew that he was looking out for my best interest, as I am sure the other 5 managers had done along the way as well.  

Unfortunately, the company took a turn for the worse and I could soon see that my future with this company that I sincerely loved was coming to an end.  I was one of the lucky ones, as I was not severed.  I knew that since I was a ???survivor???, all the hard work had been recognized and that is why I was considered a ???critical employee???.  But the longer I stayed, the more the uncertainty of the company became abundantly apparent to me and I knew I needed to do something to protect my career and myself.  I decided to seek employment outside of Enron.  I was fortunate.  I found something immediately.  I honestly believe it was because of my experience at Enron, along with having some of the best mangers and directors as mentors, that I was able to find such an opportunity.  

I knew that the day would come that I would have to give notice, but I was hoping and praying that Enron Management would not do me wrong, as so many of my friends had been.  I knew that Enron would be fair and pay me my three weeks of vacation that I was due.  I was mistaken.  When it all came down to it, Enron in the end looked out for itself.  After receiving the run around, I was eventually told that I would not receive any of my vacation, although the rules had never been revised from previous years and nothing was ever clearly communicated from Human Resources.  

I worked my ass off for Enron for 2 ?? years, and this company does not even have the decency to pay me my vacation.  I do know that my managers and directors received 90 day retention packages, that amounted to more that my annual compensation.  I know that some people within my own Enron Company were severed once it was determined that they had a job safely outside of Enron ??" that way they were assured $4,500.  I also know that when notice was given for some employees, they were immediately severed, so that their benefits would not roll into the next month.  Again, they received their $4,500 and had a job lined up to immediately go to.  What are the rules?  How should these situations have been handled?  Should not each employee be treated fairly?  

Time and time again, I stood behind Enron and you, Mr. Lay.  I honestly thought I would leave supporting Enron.  I thought it was the tragic mistake and greed of a FEW employees who took this company down.  However, based on my recent treatment, I have come to realize that there are more than a few greedy people in this company ??" ones that have yet to be recognized.  All I wanted was the one extra check that was due me.  I earned my vacation.  I worked hard and supported this company ??" and I am left with nothing, while management is left with thousands upon thousands of dollars.  I HAD to leave Enron to protect my future.  I never thought the day would come when my words regarding Enron would become resentful.  

Sincerely,

Diana Monaghan
