Dear Mr. Lay,

You should hire me to be part of the strategic planning/reorganization team
addressing Enron's current situation. Whether your goal is to salvage the
company or to attract buyers, I can add value to this effort.

My qualifications are the following. I have been a "Big 5" consultant. I can
identify recommendations whose implementation was never considered during
analysis. I have worked in a variety of industries and learned the ropes
quickly for each. I have a graduate degree, but I worked in the real world
while I earned it. I am not a "yes" man and don't believe in sucking up. I
make decisions and am accountable for my actions.

Your company will be remembered as an MBA case study. Some ambitious
professor is probably penning the intial draft as I send this e-mail. But
the ending for that case study has not been written, and I'd like to have a
hand in determining the outcome. I've attached my resume and respectfully
request an interview. You can reach me at (972) 979-6609 to schedule a
meeting.

Thanks for your time,
Bianca Hayes
