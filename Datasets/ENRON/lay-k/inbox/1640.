Dear Ken, 
Yesterday (Tuesday, October 30) I left Hong Kong at 3am for Singapore where I attended Standard Chartered PLC board meetings.  Getting home right before 3am just now, I received a note from Paula Rieker regarding the 6:30am (or 4:30pm your time) Enron board meeting.  Having to chair a conference tomorrow starting in the morning and having to speak in several sessions, I should get some sleep.  I just spoke to Paula and would call her later for an update.  
I am hopeful that the bank loans will come through Tuesday afternoon as Paula has surmised.  Let us pray that the company's difficulties will pass soon.
Sincerely, 
Ronnie Chan
