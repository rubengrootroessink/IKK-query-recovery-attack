Attention: Mark Palmer and Kenneth Lay

I have two additional quesitons I forgot to ask. The first of which is Mr.
Lay's age, is he 58 or 59 years of age. Secondly, does Mr. Lay have plans to
sell any more shares in the near future of any of the companies he is
involved in either as an executive or director?

Many thanks, and feel free to call if you have any questions,
Cassell Bryan-Low
