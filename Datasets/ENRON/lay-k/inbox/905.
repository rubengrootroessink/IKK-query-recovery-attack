Ken,
Our associates in Argentina called this morning and  suggested that we arrange a trip with you to visit with the President in Buenos  Aires any time in the next ten days.
They guarantee that the Water Company and TGS can be sold  at fair prices with the full approval of the new government. The investors are  in place to purchase TGS, the deal on the water company is the best deal Enron  will be able to get now or in the future.
Please give me a ring if this is of interest to you by  12:30 est., because we are getting a call from the office of the President at  1:00 est.
 
Best personal regards,
Steve Hacker
