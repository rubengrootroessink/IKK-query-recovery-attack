Dear Sally,

I spoke w/Ken this weekend and he said that to cut costs, he would prefer to
move his current furniture into his new office.  Please contact whoever you
need to and advise me of what they think.  Linda

Move-in date for us is December 15th and your assistance is desired for
selection of fabrics for KLL's furnishings.  You will appreciate that
time is of the essence to be certain  his office is ready for move-in.
Please let me know, or you can contact Gary Napper directly at
713/345-3984 as to your earliest availability for meeting with him and
the designer and architect, Jeffrey State.  They will tailor their
schedule around yours.  Thanks Linda.
