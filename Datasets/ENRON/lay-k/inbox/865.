Ken--

We understand that you may be heading to an auction of the wind business.
We would like to speak to you about this strategy.  An auction seems to us
to be unnecessarily costly and inefficient. We stand ready, willing, and
able to negotiate a purchase with you, and don't believe that a lengthy and
cumbersome auction process will serve anyone's best interests.

We have a key meeting on December 20 with those interested in putting the
financing together with us for this deal.  Appreciating the demands on your
time, is there any way that we could get on your schedule for even 15
minutes some time prior to the 20th?  We are ready to hop on a plane and
come to you at a moment's notice.  Let me know if you think this can work.

Many thanks,
Katie McGinty
