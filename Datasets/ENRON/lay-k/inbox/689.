Just a note to check on all our beloveds on this horrible day. We are glued  
to the tv while we carry on our daily activities in Columbia.  Actually I  
told John I hope they don't call in the WWII Submariners for active duty or  
he is in trouble. Actually there are very few of them left and I doubt this  
war will be fought in the water. 
We have had several calls this morning to inquire if we are o.k. Yes we are  
fine, except devastated about what is happening to the Country. 
On a routine note, we have painters painting our garage, workers putting on  
new siding at our rental house across the street, A furnace man putting in a  
new energy efficient furnace also in the rental house. Most of these workers  
are in good spirits..some mostly unaware of what is going on.  The furnace  
man thought the answer to our problems was that everybody should carry more  
guns. Life goes on at many different levels. 
Stay safe all of you.  Stay off the planes and out of government buildings.  
Love Bonnie
