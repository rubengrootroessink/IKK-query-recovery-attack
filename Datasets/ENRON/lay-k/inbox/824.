Dear Mr. Lay,
I would like to take this opportunity to say that I am very sorry to see th=
e developments relating to the proud company that you built, and to say tha=
nk you for the time I spent under your leadership.  I was with Enron for tw=
o and a half years, and I enjoyed that period as much as any time in my car=
eer.
>From my first exposure to you, the new employee orientation, I was very im=
pressed by your willingness to address the group, and as you walked by on y=
our way out, you smiled and nodded at me.  I was confident that I had made =
the right decision to join Enron. I also respect your sincere interest in t=
he community, and the efforts that were undertaken to help those less fortu=
nate. I believe that you handled the California energy issue with exactly t=
he right amount of finesse and determination on behalf of Enron. Your willi=
ngness to forego the significant payments available to you under your contr=
act is another example of the type of person that you are. I think that wha=
t might have impressed me the most, however, is the Christmas gathering on =
the 50th floor two years ago when you took time out of your valuable day to=
 greet and take pictures with a long line of the rank and file employees, i=
ncluding contract security personnel.  The list goes on and on, requiring m=
u! ch more time and space than is available here.
You have earned my respect, and I wish you the absolute best in the future.=
  If there is ever anything that I can do to help in any way, please do not=
 hesitate to contact me.  I have significant experience in customer/supplie=
r relationships, contracts, and I am a very effective negotiator.
Again, thank you for all that you have done for me, the energy industry, an=
d the city of Houston.=20
Sincerely,
Tom Moore
