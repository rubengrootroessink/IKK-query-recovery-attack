In the event the foundation closes sooner rather  than later, I was wondering if each of you could possibly write me a letter of  recommendation.  I think it would be good to have a letter from the  President, Vice President and all of the Board of Directors to go along with my  resume.  I would need these letters no later than January 31, 2002.   Thank you in advance.
