Dear Ken,
 
At a prayer meeting this morning I prayed for you, the Company, and all those affected by the circumstances you face.
 
I know that you are doing all that you can to help the Company and its people survive.  
 
The way we face great difficulty is the measure of our lives.  You have not run.  God will give you the strength to get thru this.
 
I know that Enron is not just a business for you, it is a dream .. a dream you have seen almost fulfilled.  I believe 'others' were sent to you to do harm .. and that they corrupted your dream.  It's a story as old as life itself.  
 
Ask God for His wisdom, His help, Hisbenediction. 
 
You are not alone Ken.  
 
God bless and keep you and your family safe.
 
John
