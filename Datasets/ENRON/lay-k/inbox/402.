Rosalee-

Massey Villarreal has asked to meet with Mr. Lay, if possible, this
Wednesday afternoon.  He would like to discuss small business development
and Center for Houston's Future with him.

Massey and Mr. Lay serve together on the Partnership board and has asked me
to assist him in coordinating the meeting.  Would you please let me know if
it would be possible to have that meeting?

I may be reached by phone at 713-644-7070, extension 228.

Thank you in advance,

Richard R. Torres
President & CEO
Houston Hispanic Chamber of Commerce
