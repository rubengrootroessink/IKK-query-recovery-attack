Mr. Lay, 
I just want you to know that I am praying for you constantly. Keep your eyes on Jesus and don't listen to what everyone is saying! He will say whatever He wants to say to you as you read the Word. He does not "point the finger" and accuse. In fact He doesn't even like that. (Isaiah 58:9  "Then shalt thou call, and the LORD shall answer; thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I am. If thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking vanity;") That word vanity in the Hebrew means trouble, wickedness, sorrow. I guess that verse means you can't do it either even when they hurt you with their words. God will defend you. 
You said something about being old fashioned that the truth will prevail. That is not old fashioned .... that is God. You have that in your heart because you have Jesus in your heart. Believe God! He says "if God is for us then who can be against us?" 
What a WONDERFUL Word of Testimony you will have when this is finished. Remember, He brings us out of ALL our afflictions! (Psalm 34:19  "Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD delivereth him out of them all.")
I listened to a teaching one time about Rev 12:11 "And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death."  They said that the devil can't take the blood away from us and that he wants to destroy our testimony. Mr. Lay, you turned to Jesus in time of trouble. That is part of this Word of Testimony. You continually pray for guidance. That is part of this Word of Testimony. You trust in Him. That is part of this Word of Testimony. You trust that He will bring you through this. That is part of this Word of Testimony. You will tell the truth. That is part of this Word of Testimony. 
When all is said and done. God is going to show you and others (2 Chron 16:9  "For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him.")
I am telling you. That is what God showed me in the 16 Days readings. God testified of a perfect heart towards him. Yours. Not that you have done "perfectly"  but that you had a "perfect heart towards him". It is clearly shown in how you conduct yourself. 
I ran across these verses and thought you might like them to encourage you. 
2 Sam 22:33  God is my strength and power: and he maketh my way perfect. 
1 Chron 29:12  Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou reignest over all; and in thine hand is power and might; and in thine hand it is to make great, and to give strength unto all.
Psalm 62:11  God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power belongeth unto God. 
Isaiah 40:29  He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength. 
If your secretary could send me the dates you are to testify before Congress, it is on my heart to pray specifically for you while you testify.
Thank you, Jesus, for your Word. Thank you for your servant, Mr. Lay. Thank you that you ARE going to get him THROUGH all of this. In Jesus name. 
Lynda Phinney 
The Joy of the Lord is my strength...
