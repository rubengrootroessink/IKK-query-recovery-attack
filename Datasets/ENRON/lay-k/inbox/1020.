As you welcome in the New Year, may I suggest that you take time out
from your schedule to be conscious and concerned about the important
issue of health.  The past year reminds us that life is precious.  I
write to invite you to visit Johns Hopkins this year, or on your way to
or from the World Economic Forum's Annual Meeting in New York.

As you may already be aware, Johns Hopkins has been ranked the best
hospital in the United States for an unprecedented eleven consecutive
years by U.S. News & World Report.  In particular, we would like to
offer Members of the World Economic Forum a comprehensive health
assessment, completed in a single day, ideal for busy executives.  Our
Executive Health program emphasizes detecting incipient health problems
in their earliest stages, and provides preventive strategies to keep
executives in top form.

We also offer assistance in scheduling appointments and second opinions
with Hopkins' renowned physicians, in numerous specialties ranging from
Ophthalmology and Urology, to the common cancers and heart disease.

Should you be interested in consumer health information for yourself or
your employees, we offer a monthly email health update free of charge.
You can simply reply to this message to request it and we would be happy
to send it to you.

I invite you to take advantage of Johns Hopkins' long tradition of
medical excellence.  If you have questions, would like additional
information, or would like to schedule an appointment, please contact me
(tel: 410-614-4331, fax: 410-614-9150, e-mail: kfrankso@jhmi.edu) at
your earliest convenience so that we can be sure to accommodate your
schedule.  I look forward to assisting you in any way possible.

With kindest regards,
