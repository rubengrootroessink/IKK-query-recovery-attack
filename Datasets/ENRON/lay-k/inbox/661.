We received this very touching message from the recently retired CFO of one
of the firm's clients.  The letter was authored by a British woman who lived
in Houston with her Norwegian husband for many years.


Dear friends:
It's almost midnight on Wednesday evening in Oslo, and I have just come home
from a walk down to the American Embassy, where I added my flowers and
candles to those already there.  I'd like to describe it to you:

* A perfect evening, very dark, but lots of stars, around 60 degrees, not a
breath of  wind.
* On one side of the street the embassy itself, where they were hard at work
adding a second row of concrete barriers.
* On the other side of the street, in front of the railings alongside the
palace grounds, a hundred yards or so of outpourings of sympathy from the
people of Oslo:
* Thousands of candles, all sizes, some standing alone, others arranged in
patterns - hearts, crosses, the letters USA.
* Bouquets of flowers of all kinds, from the simplest wildflowers to
beautiful bouquets.
* An exquisite wreath from the firefighters of Oslo.
* Norwegian and American flags
* Letters and cards in many languages.  Messages of hope, love, sympathy -
and outrage.
* Children's paintings and drawings - some depictng the horror of the plane
about to hit the tower with childlike simplicity, others showing children on
their knees praying for God to give America comfort.
* A placard with the words "The Atlantic is a creek, our sympathy is an
oceen, America is the world."
* Many, many people of all ages, walking slowly, reading the cards and
letters, and adding their own contributions.
* Not a sound to be heard, except for that of people trying to control their
tears.

It was extraordinarily beautiful, and incredibly moving.  I think it was the
utter silence that was the most powerful aspect.  The silence of grief and
mind-numbing outrage.

I thought you would like to know.

God bless you.

Love, Jan
