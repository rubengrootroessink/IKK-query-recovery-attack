Dear Mr. Lay,

Our prayers continue to go up for you, your management team, and all of us at Enron.

Peace,

Iain,

God's Word always contains good guidance - especially in times as these; therefore:
Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for men, since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving.  
Colossians 3:23-24

Good call Zach! Another obligation we have is to conduct our business dealings in a way that is pleasing to Him, regardless of staying here or moving on.

Keep smiling!

Iain.

And remember the proverb folks..."Pride Goes before a fall..."

Let's be humble whether we stay here or move on. This is not the end of the world!

Regards,

Zach
