ken, i've been following your travails at enron with
great sadness. i think i know how frustrating and
disappointing it must be to see such a great company
in such a mess. i've been reluctant to bother you
since im sure you are up to your eyeballs in i-bankers
and lawyers. but i felt i needed to send you a note to
tell you that you still have friends and admirers--and
where the blame lies--with your ex- CAO(chief
arrogance officer). once you get the decks cleared, i
hope we can find some time again for carribean cruises
or whatever. i think the world of your strategic and
leadership skills and if you want to start something
again to change the world there is no one id rather
partner with. i hope it goes without saying that if
there is anything i can do personally or
professionally to help. all you need to do is ask. eric
