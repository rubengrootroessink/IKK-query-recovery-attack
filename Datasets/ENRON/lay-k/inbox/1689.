Dear Ken :

I'm pleased to send you the inaugural issue of RFF Developments, an

2) RFF "In the News"

* RFF Fellow Tom Beierle is scheduled to appear on WAMU Radio's "Public
Interest" with Kojo Nnamdi on Wednesday November 7th.   Beierle, whose
research focuses on public participation in decisions about the
environment, will be talking about how the terrorist attacks of September
11th have derailed 'right to know' environmental protection programs on the
Internet. "Public Interest" is heard in 50 NPR stations nationwide. Beierle
will be part of a discussion and listener call-in to air between 1-2pm ET.

* Two new fellows have joined the RFF research team:
Spencer Banzhaf: Ph.D. in economics from Duke University. His areas of
expertise include Air Pollution Policy, Cost-Benefit Analysis, Nonmarket
Valuation, and Public Health. Michael Margolis: Ph. D. in economics from
University of Wyoming. His areas of expertise include Trade and
Environmental Policy, Food Systems and Security, Forests, and Resources
Policy.

* RFF board member Joseph E. Stiglitz shares this year's Nobel Prize for
Economics for his path-breaking analysis of markets with asymmetrical
information.  Congratulations, Joe!

* RFF Senior Fellow Molly K. Macauley was inducted into the International
Academy of Astronautics on September 30, 2001. The Academy recognizes
scholars from around the world who have made unique and significant
contributions to space activities. Molly was recognized for her seminal
research and policy analysis in the field of space economics.

* William Pizer is currently serving as a senior economist on the Council
of Economic Advisers in the Executive Office of the President. Pizer, whose
areas of expertise are climate and the environment, is one of nine senior
staff economists.

* Allen Blackman is spending the next six months on leave from RFF at the
University of California, San Diego's Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies.

* Carl Bauer is taking a year's leave of absence from RFF to reside in
Chile and work on water policy issues in the Southern Cone.

3) RFF New Publications
Fulfilling the Promise on Global Hunger
Religious fanaticism motivated the terror of September 11th, but poverty
and hunger remain the central obstacles to future world security. Over 800
million people remain chronically malnourished. In 1996, the United States
pledged with 185 other countries to halve this number by 2015. A new
research report by RFF's Mike Taylor and Jody Tick documents that this
commitment has not been backed by effective action. There has been no real
budget commitment, no focused leadership, and no accountability for
results. The report calls on President Bush to clearly define U.S.
interests in and objectives for global hunger and vest responsibility and
accountability for results in the Secretary of State and administrator of
the Agency for International Development.

Improving Regulation: Cases in Environment, Health and Safety
This new book from RFF Press focuses on challenges to regulatory policy
during a time of rapid technological and societal change. It also examines
the impact of organizational politics, science, technology, and performance
on regulation.
Paul S. Fischbeck and R. Scott Farrow, editors | August 2001

Discussion Papers:
"RFF and Pew Initiative on Food and Biotechnology Evaluating the StarLink
Corn Case" StarLink - a type of bioengineered corn that produces its own
pesticide and was approved only for animal feed - was found in the human
food supply just over a year ago, prompting massive recalls of corn-based
products. Resources for the Future, in cooperation with the Pew Initiative
on Food and Biotechnology, is in the process of identifying and analyzing
the regulatory and public policy issues raised by the StarLink episode.

"State-Level Variation in Land-Trust Abundance: Could it Make Economic
Sense?"
Few economic analyses examine land trusts, their decisions, and the
land-trust "industry," despite their growing importance. For example,
statistics on the wide variation in the number of trusts in different
regions of the United States raise questions about whether such variation
makes economic sense. This paper builds a model to identify the optimal
number of private conservation agents. The model depicts two competing
forces: regional spatial externalities in conservation benefits that
increase the efficiency of having fewer agents and organizational costs,
and fund-raising specialization, which increases the efficiency of having
more agents. Using state-level variables, we perform a count-data analysis
of the number of trusts conserving land in each state. We find that the
number of trusts actually observed is consistent with the optimal number of
trusts that is predicted by the model on the basis of the relative
importance of spatial externalities and organizational size in different
regions.

"An Economic Assessment of Space Solar Power as a Source of Electricity for
Space-Based Activities"
We develop a conceptual model of the economic value of space solar power
(SSP) as a source of power to in-space activities, such as spacecraft and
space stations. We offer several estimates of the value based on interviews
and published data, discuss technological innovations that may compete with
or be complementary to SSP, and consider alternative institutional
arrangements for government and the private sector to provide SSP.
