  ALMIGHTY AND EVER LIVING GOD MAY THE HEDIOUS CEOS OF
ENRON, ELPASO AND DUKE DIE OF CANCER, MAY THEIR
FAMILIES BE CURSED FOREVER WITH THE PLAGUE, MAY YOU
STRIKE THEM WITH ELECTRICAL SHOCK SO THEY ARE INFIRM
AND SUFFER MISERABLE DEATHS.  MAY THEIR CORPORATE JETS
RUN OUT OF FUEL, CRASHING AND LIVING THEM WITHOUT
LIMBS, MAY THEIR SKIN BE EXPOSED TO CANCER, MAY THEY
BREATHE SMOG FOR ETERNITY, MAY THEY CHOKE TO DEATH THE
NEXT TIME THEY EAT A BIG MAC SINCE THEY ARE ALL BIG
FAT WHITE MEN.  MAY THEIR EYES FALL OUT.  MAY
GENERATIONS OF CEOS AND THEIR OFFSPRING HAVE
HORRENDOUS DISEASES.  ALL OF THIS IN CHRIST'S NAME
THAT CEOS OF THESE COMPANIES MAY BE JUDGED FOR AN
ETERNITY OF FILTHY SUFFERING IN HELL.  MAY THEIR
MISTRESSES GIVE THEM AIDS. MAY THEY BE CURSED FOR THE
CRIMES THEY ARE COMMITTING AGAINST HUMANITY INCLUDING
THAT IDIOT FROM TEXAS WHO WILL BE KNOWN AS A ONE TERM
PRESIDENT LIKE HIS HORRIBLE FATHER.  AS FOR THE FAT
VICE PRESIDENT, MAY HIS WIFE TURN INTO A BIG DYKE LIKE
HE'S DAUGHTER. IN THE NAME OF THE GREAT 666, MAY THE
DEVIL OPEN HIS HEART TO CURSE ALL OF THE CEOS AND
THEIR FAMILIES IN CHRIST'S NAME.
AMEN
PRAYED NIGHTLY BY THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA
