Ken and Dave,

You may have received a complaint letter with regards a gas supply contract with Enron Direct from one of our customers in the UK. The customer, Mr and Mrs Forrest wrote to me through Mr Kenneth Clarke who is a Member of the Parliament in the UK. Enron Direct has dealt with the complaint as soon as it was received and we sorted out the issue with the customer directly.  In addition we wrote a letter to Mr Kenneth Clarke explaining the actions taken by Enron.

The matter is resolved and all the different parties have been informed. If you have any questions please come back to me and I will give all the details you need.

Regards,


Enrique Gimenez
Enron Direct UK
