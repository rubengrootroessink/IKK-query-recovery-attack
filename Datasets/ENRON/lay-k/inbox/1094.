if things are they seem, you will soon be getting poked in the a-hole by some lifer in the pen. good job!
ps i had invested in enron and lost 100% of that money...funny that you were selling all your stock at the time...hey maybe i was buying yours...
hope you like the feeling of stealing money from people like me...
