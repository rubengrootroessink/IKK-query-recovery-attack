I have received all of your responses regarding the board meetings at The
Huntingdon.  The first meeting will be held on Wednesday, June 20, 2001, at
4:30 p.m., at The Huntingdon in the Management Office.  I am sending this
email to confirm the meeting in Dr. Butler's absence.  I am sure that the
other board dates will be firmed up at that meeting.  Please call me if
there are any questions.  Thank you.

Diane
