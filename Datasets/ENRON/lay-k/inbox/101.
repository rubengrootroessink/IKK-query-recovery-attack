FANNY BRICE HIT MUSICAL AT WORTHAM
JULY 10-22 AS 'BABY JANE' MOVES TO 2002

Theatre Under The Stars has rescheduled the World Premiere of "What
Ever Happened to Baby Jane?"  into its 2002-03 season.  It will be
replaced by the TUTS premiere of "FUNNY GIRL," the 1964 Broadway
smash-hit that made a star of a little-known Barbra Streisand.  The
dates of "Funny Girl" will be exactly the same as for "Baby Jane, "
July 10-22, at Wortham Center.  "Funny Girl," which was later made
into a movie for which Streisand won an Academy Award, tells the story
of the legendary comedienne, Fanny Brice.  Star of saloons, burlesque,
vaudeville, movies, radio, and the Ziegfeld Follies, Brice had a
tumultuous relationship with the gambler Nicky Arnstein.  Their
star-crossed love story and Fanny's rise to stardom are the basis of
the musical.

With book by Isobel Lennart and a classic score by Jule
Styne and Bob Merrill, "Funny Girl" boasts such popular songs as
"People," "Don't Rain On My Parade," and "I'm the Greatest Star."
Bruce Lumpkin, who recently staged TUTS' acclaimed "Miss Saigon," will
direct and choreograph.

According to TUTS President/CEO Frank Young,
"What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?"  is being delayed for six months
because of design problems.  "A new work is always in the process of
development through many stages," said Young.  "At any point in the
creative process, one or more elements may cause a delay.  The
creators and I firmly believe that a few more months of development
are needed to put the show into its final, audience-ready form."


Single tickets for "FUNNY GIRL" are available on-line at
www.tuts.com/boxoffice/ticketing.htm using TUTS E-ticket system, by
phone at 800/678-4330, in person at either TUTS' box office, 2600
Southwest Freeway.

Production sponsors for "FUNNY GIRL" are the Humphreys Foundation,
El Paso Energy, Mr. and Mrs. Geoffrey Roberts, and Humana.

ATTENTION TUTS SUBSCRIBERS: You do not need to do anything.
Do not return your tickets.  Just show up at the theatre with your
"Baby Jane" tickets on your performance date and time and you will be
seated for "FUNNY GIRL."  No new tickets will be issued.
