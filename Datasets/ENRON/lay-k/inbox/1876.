Dear Ken :

I am pleased to extend an invitation to you to attend a workshop on "The
Distributional Impacts of Carbon Mitigation Policies: Various Lenses on the
Issue," hosted by Resources for the Future in its first floor conference
center (1616 P Street NW, Washington, DC) on December 11, 2001. Supported
by the Energy Foundation, this workshop will present the results of new
research conducted by RFF scholars on the critical question of who would
pay should the U.S. undertake carbon mitigation measures.

As described in the attached agenda, four papers will be presented.  A
common focus for discussion is how much compensation might be justified for
different sectors, the form such compensation might take, and the
institutions that may be involved.  In order to facilitate free and open
discussion, this is a closed meeting with a limited number of invitees.  I
hope you can join us on the 11th from 8:30 a.m. - 12:15 p.m. and then stay
for an informal lunch. Please RSVP by November 30 to Karin Warner
(202-328-5177 or warner@rff.org).

I look forward to seeing you there.

Sincerely,
Paul R. Portney
President and Senior Fellow
