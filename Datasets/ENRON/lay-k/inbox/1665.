Dear Enron Chairman, Board of Directors and Investor Relations  
ENRON STOCK IS FREE FALLING AND LOT OF CLEVER  TRADERS ARE SHORTING WHILE THE NEW YORK EXCHANGE SPECIALIST, ANALYSTS, MEDIA  JOIN THEM TO COMPOUND THE PROBLEM and now S& P downgrade
so here are some ideas....
You ALL must work very very hard  till Monday morning  NONSTOP to help Enron, stockholders, Employees and all....by taking these steps
1) Get Warren Buffet/ and kind to take a position.........even a token one....it will boost lot of faith
2) Disclose the impact of the financial partnerships  ...1 billion, 2 or what?..a specific bottom-line.....with maximum cap...the investment community is begging you to say something
3) Speak up......Engage media into positive news..... some thing positive about Enron's business and future
wall street hates solence....no matter what your lawyers are telling you/......you must make strong positive statements
4) Please talk to Royal Dutch (Shell)/Duke and  competition about possible merger and stuff
5) see if u can get an upgrade from a broker...who really sees the value in the stock.......in spite of problems....talk to wall street/barrons
6) If someone can claim the responsibility.....this is the time....and lets move on with the right foot forward
7) Ask emlpoyess/management to buy stock to support it
8) Your 2 worst enemies are the people who are shorting the stock & one who are saying bad things about Enron..... REQUEST people to stop shorting &  saying irresponsible statements about the company....They are truly driving a great company to the ground.........
thats not easy or conventional, but it can help people understand where the real decline is coming from and the true problems are much smaller than what media will like it to be
9) work harder..overtime.....long hours..to improve business......starting from top.....practically 7 days a week....to show the world..that when going gets tough..neron does everything it can....beacuse it believes in ultimate sacrifice.....and commitment
10)  Calculate the asset and liabilities worth and show the world..what you are truly worth......even on a conservative business
an open advertisement or interview
resources....assets.....liabilities.....amount of sales.....profits.....small interesting facts.....you can give it in a informal interview to a Houston paper...cnbc....or CNN.....it will do you good
so people can understand your story better
and lastly, i am born in India and live in USA for 31 years.....i know the culture and i can help you with the negotiations in India......i am very good at this and want you to call me to get my input
i have over 73000 shares of Enron and i am hurting like many others....so i want to do everything to help you
