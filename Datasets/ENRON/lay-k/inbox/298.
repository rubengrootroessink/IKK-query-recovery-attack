Dad,
I was talking with Kathleen this weekend and she had
some ideas and suggestions about Enron. I asked her to
put them in writing so that I could share them with
you. I am attaching her memo. Please keep in mind, she
loves her job, these are just ideas to make it that
much better.
I love you, Dad,
Elizabeth
