Mr. Lay,

We have not met, but I want to thank you for the letter you sent to all
employees re: Sept. 11.

I am a still-new employee (1+ years) of Portland General Electric (a
wholly owned electric utility subsidiary :-), but I want to tell you
how proud I am of being a member of a team so dedicated to doing its
best at all times -- even in the absolute worst of times, as we've
experienced in the last month.

I only hope that if PGE must leave the Enron family, we will be able to
maintain the same high level of respect and integrity we've achieved to
date. I am proud to be an Enron/PGE employee.

Regards,

Jeana McClure
