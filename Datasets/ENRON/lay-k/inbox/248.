Hi Mr. Dickerson -

I apologize for the delay in getting back with you.  If it would still be
convenient for Dean Streetman, Ken Lay can meet with him the morning of
November 14 - possibly 9:30 a.m.

Please let me know.

Rosalee Fleming

   Ken,
   Ben Streetman, Dean of the UT School of Engineering, tells me that he
   will be in Houston on November 14 and would like to meet with you. I
   realize that your schedule is overflowing these days; however, should
   time permit, the Dean would sincerely appreciate an opportunity to visit
   with you for a few minutes.
   Thank you.
   Kenneth R. Dickerson
