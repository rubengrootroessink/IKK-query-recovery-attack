Dear Ken,

I hope you 'visit' with the Governor was as fruitful as mine.  we are
very favorably supported in our development of a Regional Energy
Efficiency Initiative ... an approach to defining and delivering
sustainable energy efficiency. (not conservation!)

There is an opportunity to discuss a way in which Enron could perhaps
become involved in a very significant set of new developments within the
sphere of influence in which I operate.  If you wish to 'look into' this
.. let me know.  I believe such an endeavor during this difficult time
might well stand you in good stead .. and its a way to enter the end use
services business.

I look forward to getting to Aspen  for the AI conference.

John
