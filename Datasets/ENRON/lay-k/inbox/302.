Dear Valued Customer,

The Enron Creative Center is initiating a comprehensive survey of its customers' satisfaction, and would very much like to include your feedback.  Bowne Business Solutions is proud to be the onsite provider of Enron's graphic services.  I would like to invite you to take a moment to complete a brief survey about the BBS services at Enron.  In order to protect your privacy, BBS has engaged the services of independent market research firm Optimal Edge to manage the project. Your individual identity is guaranteed to be 100% protected, as all responses are accepted anonymously on a secure Web server, where the survey is hosted by CustomerSat, Inc.  We sincerely hope you will take a few minutes to participate, as your feedback and comments will help BBS better understand your needs.

To go to the survey customized for Enron simply click on the following address:
