Dear Anthony,

As you are aware, Band-X India is representing GLOBAL SWITCH's interest in
your facility in Mumbai.  We have requested your Mumbai team for information
pertaining to the business status - as it will only aid us in finalising a
suitable offer.

I have expressed clearly and at numerous occasions that we are not
competitors (see mail below) - which seems to be why we have not been given
any information / support in processing our interest.

As representatives it is expected that we represent the clients interests in
full - in terms of expression of interest to you (which has been expressed
directly via Global Switch); evaluation of the opportunity and assistance in
formulation of offer.

FYI BSPL is in receipt of NDAs signed by Band-X as well as Global Switch.  I
would appreciate if you could assist in ensuring that we receive the
necessary information at the earliest.

Regards,
Pran Mehra

CEO, Band-X India

Pran,

I'm not at all clear where you are with GS - are they planning to put in an
offer ?

On the marketing side, I am uncomfortable releasing specific information
until I have the conversation with GS and gauge their interest, esp. since
Band-X are potential direct competitors.

Rahul
