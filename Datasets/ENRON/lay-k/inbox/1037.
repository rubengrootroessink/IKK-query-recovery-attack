 - Holiday Shopping on the Net 2001  This year I decided to purchase all of=
 my Holiday gifts on the Internet - even down to the wrapping paper and tap=
e.  By using sites that offered free shipping or deep discounts I was able =
to save over $100 dollars by not paying sales tax and I got to avoid the ma=
lls.  The following represents my Top Ten Observations:  Be prepared to tur=
n your home into a warehouse! I ordered over 20 items from Amazon that resu=
lted in 12 large boxes.  Why does Barbie need her own box that could easily=
 hold a DVD player?   Consolidating orders could work for me, even if it me=
ant a slight delay in arrival. Pet peeve number 1 - After many hours of "br=
owsing" items and comparing prices, I settled on an item.   Three days late=
r I received an email saying that the item was out of stock.   This reminde=
d me of retail bait and switch tactics.  If you don't have the product, tak=
e it off your site! Pet peeve number 2 - Customer service representatives w=
ho don't have information about your online order.   If you are going to se=
ll online you need to service your online customers.   The days of being ab=
le to say - "I will research this and get back to you" are over.  Companies=
 need to empower their front line personnel with data.   It's too easy for =
me just to place my next order with the competition. Pet peeve number 3 - L=
et me track my package.  Those sites that do not allow tracking of orders c=
ost company more money.  It means you had to place numerous calls to their =
service department to check on delivery status. Pet peeve number 4 - Shoppi=
ng carts that "lock up".  When this happens I not only abandon my order, I =
abandon doing business with the company. Great stuff number 1 - After placi=
ng an order some companies sent me an email with a discount gift certificat=
e to use on my next order.  This "25%" sent me rushing back to the site, wh=
ich built customer loyalty. Great stuff number 2 - Payal.  When buying on e=
Bay, this service allows you to email funds directly to the seller.  No mon=
ey order, no checks, and the funds can come right out of your checking or s=
aving accounts.  It's a great way to do business and it's free. Great stuff=
 number 3 - There are a few things that really stand out on some sites.  He=
re they are:   Allowing the customer to "search" the site - seems so simple=
 - but not everyone has the capability.  Pre-filled forms.  When I go back =
to a site to place another order it's great when my shipping and billing in=
formation is already there.   It saves me time and also increases my loyalt=
y. Great stuff number 4 - Comparison-shopping for price.  Sites like mysimo=
n.com and cnet.com allowed me to find the best deals.  The price and shippi=
ng rates differ in such a big way from company to company - a great tool es=
pecially for electronics. Internet shopping has come a long way.  Those com=
panies that make it easy to do business with them have a great advantage.  =
However, that advantage is quickly lost when the user experience comes up s=
hort in the service area.  Companies that respond to emails, and can answer=
 customer questions over the phone help to bridge the gap between the expec=
tations of the customer and the experience the customer has.  As companies =
strive to create their brand and the need to "arm" their sites and customer=
 service organization with best of breed technology becomes critical.  I wi=
ll gladly spend my money with the company but they have to give me a reason=
 to not spend it with their  competitor.  What was the last Internet custom=
er service experience you had?  Did the company go out of its way to satisf=
y you? Or was it just the opposite? We want to hear from you.  Please email=

sue: Content Management and Its Importance to your Portal Strategy  What is=
 Content Management?   Content Management is defined as the people, process=
es and the systems that organizations use to create, store, update and dist=
ribute its key information and intellectual assets.   Although this definit=
ion may vary, the key concepts do not change across organizations.  It has =
become very apparent in the marketplace that with the proliferation of port=
al and web sites the content management challenge is becoming an increasing=
 focus in large organizations.  Clients are more and more driving technolog=
y decisions based on content management requirements as opposed to portal n=
eeds.   Forrester defines Enterprise Content Management as "an integrated a=
pproach to managing documents, Web content and digital assets".  This is th=
e broadest sense of content management.  One way to gain a clear picture of=
 the term "content management" is to consider the various segments of the c=
ontent life cycle.  The most pertinent segments to content management are: =
 Content Creation - Includes creation/revision, collaboration, review and a=
pproval.  The review and approval process can utilize workflow built into c=
ontent management applications.  Content Maintenance - Includes content sto=
rage, access control and version control.  Content that has been created an=
d approved is stored in a repository or database.  This content can then be=
 combined with other approved content items to create rich sets of informat=
ion.  Additionally, previous versions of content items are maintained and c=
an be accessed at any time to bring back a previous state of information wi=
thout introducing rework.  Content Delivery/Distribution - Includes the dep=
loyment of approved content from repository to an information channel.  Sto=
red content can be aggregated and deployed to any number of channels (web, =
print, call center, wireless device etc.) utilizing specifically defined fo=
rmats.  This is called channelization and is one of the major benefits to c=
ontent management.  Content Management streamlines the process of creating,=
 managing and delivering content, and puts processes in place to manage and=
 control information as it is moved across the enterprise and to customers =
through the various information channels.  Historically, content management=
 systems have not addressed all segments but rather focused  specifically o=
n one or two.  Some systems may focus more on content creation, format and =
delivery (Web Content Management) whereas others may be more focused on sto=
rage and maintenance of documents and other forms of unstructured content (=
Document Management Systems).   Fortunately, content management solutions a=
re maturing and  these two worlds are starting to converge to better serve =
the entire enterprise.  Not everyone is there but the future is bright and =
therefore, consideration to the type of content that is to be managed is im=
portant input into making a decision on the system that will best serve an =
organization's needs.  As content management matures and addresses the ente=
rprise in a more holistic manner, organizations must consider the change to=
 the enterprise that must take place to realize the benefits of such system=
s.   Content creation is no longer limited to a few but can be distributed =
among many with little or no technical skills.  Content approval and distri=
bution can be handled programmatically in addition to manually and will req=
uire careful consideration to future roles and processes.  With so much cha=
nge it is important to leadership to embrace the idea of content management=
 by recognizing the importance of managing that will most certainly take pl=
ace.  This may include  conducting a change readiness assessment and a chan=
ge management plan.  Additionally, it is also important for leadership to h=
ave clear buy-in so that the organization understands the importance of the=
 many steps that will be required to take on the road to content management=
.  5 Challenges to Content Management Implementation  Enterprises have comp=
lex workflows to move information across departments, but limited control o=
r collaboration on how that information is edited, managed, published or re=
tired - resulting in inconsistencies across the enterprise and customers. C=
onversion is a major undertaking of any Content Management implementation a=
nd requires a solid understanding of existing content and how to best organ=
ize it to improve efficiencies.   This requires an assessment of structured=
 vs. unstructured content to understand how content will be organized and i=
f more structure is required. Globalization increases the complexity of the=
 entire content lifecycle, as multiple versions of content assets must be m=
anaged in addition to translation.  Additionally, support of multiple langu=
ages requires applications that can handle the required character sets and =
becomes important when selecting software packages. Defining the appropriat=
e content attributes (meta tags).  Attributes define the meaning of content=
 and are integral to good organization and appropriate personalization. Int=
egration with Enterprise Applications can present challenges to the develop=
ment effort.  This is especially true if the Content Management does not ha=
ve a pre-built interface.  10 Problems in Existing Enterprises that Content=
 Management Applications Can Resolve  As content assets increase in number,=
 it becomes more and more difficult for content authors and administrators =
to find a single piece of content they are looking for, compounding confusi=
on and efficiency. Increasing number of authors can quickly cause version c=
ontrol and communication issues.  As an enterprise expands nationally or ev=
en globally, this issue can quickly be  compounded by access limitations. A=
bandoned protocol (manual approval processes being ignored). Authors with n=
o technical skills depend on technical resources to get content published t=
o the appropriate locations.  This can create a bottleneck at the developme=
nt team and cause significant delays to getting current information out to =
customers. Changes to web content may be required daily, hourly or even eve=
ry minute.  This can quickly become and impossible task for a web master or=
 group of content managers who are manually making changes and deploying co=
ntent to various media. Management of multiple types of content assets (tex=
ts, graphics, multimedia etc.) is almost impossible to organize and deploy =
efficiently without the programmatic organization of content management app=
lication. Where different media (print, web, wireless, etc.) are supported =
separately, it is often difficult to maintain consistency of content due to=
 development time a resource availability. Departmental ownership of conten=
t. Client participation.   Ongoing ownership and support requires the clien=
t to be involved from beginning to end. Maintaining control of project scop=
e is always challenging, especially when dealing with relatively new techno=
logy such as content management systems.  This is quickly compounded as app=
lications to integrate with are added to the plan.  Scope control can be ma=
intained and expectations can be managed with a thorough definition of the =
project up front.   5 Things To Ask Vendors When Selecting a Content Manage=
ment Product  What enterprise applications do you integrate with/have partn=
erships with? What unique capabilities does your product provide over your =
competitor's? How customizable is your product? Does your product support s=
tandards based programming (Java, XML)? How long has this product been out =
and how many customers have implemented it to date?  Critical Steps to Deve=
loping Your Content Management Solution:  Conduct a 3-4 week project to con=
firm the content management and conversion requirements, assess the current=
 capability, develop client specific value proposition and develop a projec=
t roadmap for a rollout of content management solution.  The activities in =

 editing, approval and publishing content Content conversion requirements -=
