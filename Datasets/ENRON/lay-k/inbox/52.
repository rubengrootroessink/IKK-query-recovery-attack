Ken,

I was pleased to have an opportunity to meet with you and Linda in April to
discuss the Library/Honors campaign.  To date, over $12.3 million has been
raised and we have several proposals outstanding.  I'm writing to ask your
help with Jack Trotter, a trustee of the Vivian L. Smith Foundation.

Earlier this year you indicated that you would be willing to sign a letter
to Mr. Trotter on behalf of the Library/Honors building project.  Enclosed
is a draft of the letter.  A proposal for $250,000 was submitted to the
Foundation in May, the trustees are scheduled to meet on June 15.  Mr.
Trotter is a trustee with both the M.D. Anderson Foundation (which has
already committed $1 mil to the library/honors project) and the Vivian L.
Smith Foundation.  The Smith Foundation provided a grant of $500k to the
KUHT/KUHF Melcher building that opened last fall.

Please let me know if you have any question regarding the enclosed letter.
Also, please fax or e-mail the final letter to me at the address below.

Thank you very much.

Johanna Wolfe
