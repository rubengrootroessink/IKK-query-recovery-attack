Dear Mr. Lay:

On behalf of Senator Bayh, thank you for the kind invitation to attend the "U.S.
Energy Policy at a Crossroads: Alternative Futures for the Current Energy
Crisis," on October 3-4, 2001.  The Senator appreciates your thinking of him,
but unfortunately he has a prior commitment, which will prevent him from
attending the forum.  Please accept his sincere regrets.

Again, thank you for your thoughtful invitation.  I wish you the best of success
with your event.

Sincerely,

Corinne Tapia
Deputy Scheduler
