Dad,
I just wanted to let you know that I love you and I am
here if you need ANYTHING!
I am in Boston until late Wednesday (I am visiting
Christina, Tad, and baby Jack). They all send their
love and support to you as well.
Jack is adorable!
We are all praying for you and all the people at
Enron.
I love you!
Elizabeth
