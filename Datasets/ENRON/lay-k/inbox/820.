Character Building

During the winter months, with all the snow and cold, you probably
notice the icicles that often form on houses, cars, and trees. Bet you
didn't think of them having a spiritual lesson embedded in them did
you?

Have you ever stopped to consider how they are formed? Have you noticed
that the dripping water froze, one drop at a time, until over a period
of days, the icicle was a foot long or more. If the water is clean, the
icicle remains clear and sparkles brightly in the sunlight; but if the
water is ever so slightly muddy, that icicle will be cloudy. The beauty
and brilliance will be spoiled.

Our character is formed in like manner. Each thought,
every feeling, and all of our actions influence the whole, bit by bit.
Each decision that we make, both great and small, contributes its part.
Everything we take into our minds and souls -- the impressions,
experiences, and words we absorb and use -- all of these work together
to create our character.

We should be aware of the "droplets of influence" we allow to slowly
build our lives. After all, Solomon said, "The integrity of the upright
shall guide them." (Proverbs 11:3)

When the Son shines on your life -- are you clear and clean, or has
your character become cloudy? What droplets of influence are you
putting into your character?
