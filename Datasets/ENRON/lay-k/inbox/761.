Mr. Lay,
   I am a current holder of Enron common stock. I would like your opinion. I am 61 years old. My first stock purchase was of my Enron stock earlier this year. ($38.65)
I am not in the market for the short term. I am not spending money that will affect my standard of living. I am considering buying a couple of hundred shares of Enron stock. Do you think this purchase would be an investment that will grow in the long term or would it be a donation to Enron's creditors.

Thank You.
