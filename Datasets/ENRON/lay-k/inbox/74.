Ken,

I am interested in a Board position with a mid-market publicly traded
company.  I have 25 years of solid business experience with strengths in
Finance, Technology, and Human Resources. I have served on numerous
Non-profit Boards and have an excellent track record for my work.  This
position would also provide me the flexibility to spend some time in
Washington DC to support the Bush Administration.

Attached is my resume. Please review and provide feedback. Look forward to
hearing from you.
Will be out of the country from June 1-12, 2001.
