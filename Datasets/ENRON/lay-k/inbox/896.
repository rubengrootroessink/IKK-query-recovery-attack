PS.  These quotes in a recent Christmas Card we received this year,
certainly made us stop and think and count our blessings...

"Some people say that Christmas is too expensive, but I don't agree with
them... you can say prayers for free."  Kersten, Age 10

"...All of the best presents are wrapped in heaven...then we get them later
on."  Sylvia, Age 10

"It's a time when somebody feels bad, it's still like they have a smile on
their face.  To me, it's the happiest time of year."  Chelsea, Age 12

"It's a neat story, how one kid's birth started the whole thing."  Ross, Age
9

"You can have Christmas even if you don't have a fireplace and a chimney...
All you have to have is a family."  Alice, Age 9
