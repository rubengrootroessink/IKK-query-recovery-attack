My child, Dane, was previously enrolled in Enron Kids.  Since I was laid off last Monday, I had to take him out.  I understand through Lorraine Gibbs that the daycare has now opened up to the public.  What is the possibility of coming down on the monthly charge?  
 
I think it would be a nice gesture to the parents that previously had kids enrolled there to be able to bring their child(ren) back instead of having to enroll them into another daycare.  I understand that I will not be able to pay $560 a month since Enron will not be subsidizing, but it would be nice if Enron could lower the rate to $600 per child.  Enron Kids is a wonderful place with wonderful teachers.  It would be a shame to have to close such a facility.
 
Please consider this.  It would be very important to several parents if they could have their child(ren) back downtown at the same daycare.  
 
I know that there are many parents interested in bringing their child back to Enron Kids.  I also have talk to other downtown parents who would possibly be interested in brining their child downtown if the rate was lowered.
 
Thank you for your time and consideration.
