Dear Mr. Lay,
I just want to send you a note to say thank you for all you've done for Enron.  I've been with Enron for 15 years (straight out of college).   I may have been impacted financially with what is currently going on but I certainly don't blame you nor anyone for that matter.  It just is.  Thanks to Enron, I have had a very good job for the last 15 years.  This might be the only company I've known but I do have friends that work at other company and this I know.  Not all companies give employees bonuses, stock options, ESOP, upward mobility, matching retirement funds, cash accounts, competitive salary, challenging work environment, on-site health care, on-site workout place, subsidized cafeteria, matching gift giving, involvement in charitable work and community, and many other good things.  I know that you and Enron have always care for the employees and for the community.  

In this time of crises, I'm sure there will be criticism no matter what you do but please do not pay attention because your family and friends and I'm sure many employees know that you are an honest and classy person with much integrity.  

THANK YOU ALWAYS.
