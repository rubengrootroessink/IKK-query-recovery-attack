I recently sent to you an e-mail outlining our current status with EnronOnline and asking you to call i2 to gauge their interest in the software.  

As per Greg Brady's e-mail below, it appears that call may be unnecessary.

Thanks.

Greg Piper

Based on market conditions, and others issues we are dealing with
internally at i2, we are not interested in evaluating this opportunity any
longer.

Let's stay in touch as things change.

Thanks
Greg
