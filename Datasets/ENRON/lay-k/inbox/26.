Hi Ken,
=20
How is my famous fabulous cousin???  Our son  Eric was home last weekend an=
d went to the bank with me.  The banker, Eddie  Smith, came out to see Eric=
 and see how he was doing.  He was glad Eric was  working on his MBA.  I me=
ntioned that Eric had applied at Associated  Electric in Springfield but ha=
d already committed to an internship at an  insurance company and had agree=
d to be a graduate assistant for the fall  semester by the time Associated =
called him.  He would still like to get on  there at the beginning of next =
year.  Eddie said Associated was a good  co-op and would be a good starting=
 place but that Eric might want to contact  Kenneth Lay.  He went on to say=
 that Kenneth was Dewayne Rees' cousin  and started telling about all of yo=
ur fine attributes and what a fine  company Enron is!  He thinks you have d=
one quiet well for yourself!   Anyway, when he finally let me say something=
 I informed him that you was also my  mothers first cousin and the rest of =
us claimed you also!  He had to think  about that for a minute but finally =
put the connections together.  Eddie  has always been really good to my par=
ents and to us.  I worked for him  several years ago and he takes credit fo=
r helping raise me! =20

Erin graduated from high school last Friday  night.  She was one of the val=
edictorians and we are very proud of  her!  She accomplished this while wor=
king part-time at First National Bank  and she also completed 12 credit hou=
rs of college this year.   She is  planning on attending SMSU in Springfiel=
d in the fall.  In the more  immediate future, she plans to fly to Dallas t=
he first of June to spend a week  with one of her friends families.  She di=
d this last year and they took her  to San Antonio.  They really spoil her =
and she has decided that Texas is  the best place in the whole country!

So how is your family?  Any new  grandchildren?  We hope you and your famil=
y are having a  great year!  Keep in touch!

Your cousin,=20
