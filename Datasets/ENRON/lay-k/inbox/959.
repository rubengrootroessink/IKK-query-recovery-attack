All,

May 18th is Theatre Under the Stars Gala- 35th Anniversary and Inaugural
event AT the new Hobby Center. The Hobby Center for the Performing Arts
Foundation will be having their own (separate) fundraising events the week
before the Theatre Under the Stars Gala...to actually open the building and
to finish their building and operational funds.  Please do not get these two
events confused.

Contributing to one organization  does NOT put funding into the other. They
are separate organizations.

Theatre Under the Stars has been "homeless" for three years now and have not
been able to produce  full  complete seasons of shows... as TUTS has used
whatever facility we could squeeze into with the other Arts organizations in
town. Thus we have a GREAT need to make the Theatre Under the Stars 35th
Anniversary and Inaugural Gala very successful and to bring funding into
Theatre Under the Stars so we can produce the world class productions you
have become accustom to here in Houston from Theatre Under the Stars.

Please don't hesitate to call your friends and tell them to save the date
now. After we have received your "friends" list the actual  Save the date
cards and invitations will be mailed .

Call me if you have any questions. Thank you.

Cheryl
