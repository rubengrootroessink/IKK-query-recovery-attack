I do not know if this email will find your eyes or not....

  I just wanted to tell you, as a shareholder,
  since we are in a difficult time period,
  to PLEASE continue to keep your chin-up,
  and look at this "storm" as a time
  to be strong and use your courage to make the tough
  decisions to keep Enron afloat...and utilizing
  all your strength and prayers...you will
  be able to lead ENRON to safe harbors once again.

   Do not let the negative media effect you, please
   keep pushing forward, and you will be successful.

   This adversity will prepare you and strengthen
   you for the "perfect storm" we will run into
   throughout our existence...


   Thanks for listening...

   PS Back in during the Econmic Summit here in
      Houston, you met my daughter Sophia, and she
      wrote to you, and you took the time to write
      her back about 11 years old...
      well now she is 21 and a
      major in PR/Communications at BYU in Provo, UT,
      and on November 20th at 3:00 PM she has decided
      to marry to Jacob Little in Utah..
