Dear Dr. Lay:

As a stockholder, I am as upset as you, most Enron employees and other
co-shareholders are given Enron's recent performance due to questionable
management by scrupulous officers at Enron.

As an ex-employee, I have seen many signs of a major collapse, given the
fact that Enron's values (such as Respect, Integrity, Communicatons and
Excellence) were simply not followed by Enron's officers and senior members
of management.  There are examples, such as in Panama, Palestine, and the
Dominican Republic.  One bad deal after the other with questionable
economics and accounting to make each deal look good for the personal
benefit of one individual in charge.

It is about time that you get rid of these individuals and bring Enron back
to what you have built over the years to be a successful company.

Regards,

ken booi
