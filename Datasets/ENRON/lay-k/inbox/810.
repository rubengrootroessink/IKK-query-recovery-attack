Interesting what God had me read this morning in my walk. Malachi (the whole book), Genesis 1, and 1 Cor 13. 
The Malachi reading was a hard reading but as always God shows His mercy. Oh and also, He had me read Exodus 33:7-23. I just LOVE that passage!
Yesterday's reading was Hosea 10 through the end of the book. It was a hard reading too but God has me seeing so much about His salvation. 
Probably the biggest thing He has in my heart towards ya'll is really how David felt about God in that when things looked the darkest for him and He had sinned before the Lord, he went before God to cry out for God's mercy. I see how Moses ALWAYS cried out for the people. God wants us to know how merciful He is. If he counted our wrongs against us we would ALL perish!! 
As I was reading Hosea yesterday, it occurred to me how much we worship or look to the "idols we make with our hands". Then I could see how God wants us to tear those down and turn to Him but it occurred to me that the idol of "self" is always with us. How do we really realize that He alone is our source. We say it but to never even whisper in our hearts that "I did this. This is the work of MY hands." How can we tear that idol down? Then it hit me - God tears down that idol for us. It takes God to bring things into our life to deliver us from this idol. 
I just pray that God will show you His heart towards you in what is being said. That His still small voice will minister the passionate desire and love He has for you. That He is with you. That He will work all of this together for good in your life because you are called according to His purpose.  Even the "hard sayings" will minister an affection that will bring from you a,  "Yes, Lord, You alone are my God. I will have no other Gods before You. I am the sheep of Your pasture. It is You that has made me and not me myself. I love you too, Lord. I am counting on your mercy and compassion and I need to hear the "abundance of rain" so that I know what you want me to do."
Remember, you are Your Beloved's and He is yours...(Song of Solomon 2:16)."
