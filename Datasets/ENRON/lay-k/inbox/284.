Great news!  Would the August 8th from 3:00-5:00pm work?  And we would love
for Mr. Lay to stay for dinner - is this doable?

   Dear Lane -

   Ken Lay said to advise you that he can speak to the session August 5 -
   16.  He could do some time during the 8/6-9 timeframe.  Which day would
   work best?  Please indicate what the schedule would be also.

   Thanks very much.

   Mr.  Lay,

   Hello.  Tori left a message requesting me to  send my invitation to you
   again...we really feel is it vital that now, more than  ever, our top
   military leaders need to hear from the private sector's top  leaders
   (like yourself) so that we can learn from their mistakes and  capitalize
   on their success.  I truly hope you will consider speaking  to this
   prestigious group of gentlemen who are the decision makers in  our proud
   military.  I look forward to hearing from  you.

   Respectfully,

   Lane  A. Fabby
   Special Assistant, CEE
