Hello Ken,
I'm an auditor for ETS Controls in the Omaha office.  I attended the videocast of the employee meeting yesterday, and just wanted to say I think you, Greg, Mark and the others did a great job in addressing the issues--especially given all the swirling circumstances.  Thanks.

I get similar vibes from fellow co-workers here, too.
