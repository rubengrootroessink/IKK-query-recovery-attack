You lie like a dog. What an affront to say, "MY family
lost a lot of money this year too." That's what you
said at the Oct. 16 all-empoyee meeting. How
disgusting. I am sure you have trouble finding health
coverage. Can't keep up your jet-setting lifestyle
anymore? Sure you can, you idiot!

Cheers! See you in court.
