Mr. Lay, I worked for ENRON from 5/97 until 5/01 and I just want to say
that I am so sorry that all of this is coming down on 'our Company'.   I
have worked for two companies that I feel are the strongest in their
sector, Bechtel and Enron.   Both Companies have back-bone and care about
their employees.  Please pull Enron through this economically trying time.
Things look tough but sometimes when the tough times hit - we have to hit
back.

My thoughts and prayers are with you as you try to do the best for Enron,
the Company and the people that are still there backing you.

Sincerely,


Jan Dunn
