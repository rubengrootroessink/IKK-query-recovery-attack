Although you have many things on your mind, former
employees that have been left out in the cold deserve
better than they are getting. The following was sent
to questions@enron.com:

I understood that the petition for the $4500 ($4650)
for immediate relief was only one of at least two or
more.

Based on a group meeting on 12/03, prior to being
asked to vacate the building, it was my understanding
that there was also a petition, presented by Enron on
behalf of its severed employees, before the bankruptcy
court for the "standard" severance package that was
posted on the enron.com website.

Due to the speed at which Enron filed for bankruptcy,
respect for loyal employees that were let go, the
general state of the economy, and time of year, it
would be appreciated if someone within the company
could work with the court to assist employees in
providing relief in the form of the severance package
rather than each of us having to petition the court.

Whoever is reviewing these questions is still at Enron
and understands that $4500 is not going to keep the
wolf from the door long enough for most of us.

Please advise.


=====
Sincerely,

June Walker
