Mr. Lay,

=09My name is Stephen Perich and I am an analyst working in Gas Trading.  I=
 just wanted to write you and give you an update on the mood here on the fl=
oor, which I expect can be found throughout the company given the current s=
ituation.  Although we continue to work and perform our jobs, I have been h=
earing some comments that suggest some people might be giving up.  When sma=
ll problems arise, one can hear, "Don't worry about it, it doesn't matter n=
ow anyway."  That kind of attitude at this time is detrimental, what we sho=
uld be seeing is extra effort to try and reverse the situation. =20
=09I would never presume to know how a CEO should act in these circumstance=
s.  In fact, I know that you must have a good idea how to handle these situ=
ations, or you would not be the leader of this great company.  However, I d=
o know that you are still our leader, and we look to you and trust you to d=
o your best.  I have faith that you are doing your best, and I can imagine =
how difficult your job is right now.  But I think there are some who might =
be starting to question management's decisions, and even if those decisions=
 are contingent upon a concern for the employees' interests.  I think this =
can be solved through one of our core values, COMMUNICATION.  I am sure tha=
t whatever is going on right now is speculative and that no one is sure of =
anything, and that is exactly what we are hearing from CNBC.  But I don't t=
hink that the employees want to hear it from CNBC, they would like to hear =
it from their leader.  Even if nothing is concrete, you have no definitive =
answers, and you really have no idea what is going to happen, just send us =
an email saying, "I know you are all on edge about what is going on, but ri=
ght now I have nothing concrete to report, I have no definitive answers, an=
d I really don't have any idea what will happen, but I will let you know as=
 soon as I do."  I can't emphasize how much it would mean for the employees=
 to hear that. =20
=09I also would like to thank you for your hard work, I can imagine you are=
 enduring stress which none of us are familiar with.  But please remember t=
hat you are CEO for a reason, be confident in your abilities and in those o=
f you subordinates, and continue to work hard.  Thanks again and good luck.=
=20

Sincerely,

SP
