Ken,
 
Here are a few items that should be addressed  and/or corrected.
 
1.    A recent caller on a Houston  talk radio show stated that you personally own, not just one, but several  jet aircraft and travel in them on a regular  basis.
 
2.    The Houston Chronicle stated  that you spent time in Aspen between Christmas and the New Year.
 
3.    People in the media  are asking, "Why is Ken not attending the upcoming employee  meeting?"
 
I'll forward anything else I hear or read  immediately.
 
Love,
 
David.
