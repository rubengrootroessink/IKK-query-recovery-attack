Why have you allowed this to happen....we have lost everything despite working our butts off.

You have had the most talented people in the business as you keep reminding us, so why?

Your millions will keep you insulated from true hardship, we will have to endure further hardship, including non payment of receipts incurred on behalf of doing business for Enron.

I don't regret my time here but I am disgusted at the mode of departure.

Regards,

Brian Hunter-Lindsay
