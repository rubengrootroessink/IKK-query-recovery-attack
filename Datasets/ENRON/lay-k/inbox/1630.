Dear Ken,

I am packaging up extra anxiety control pills to go down to your office.
Please have Earl pick them up at the front door.

I love you,
Linda

Dear Phyllis,

Bless you for your care and concern.  I have forwarded on to Ken's office
and will get him to Aspen as soon as the smoke clears.  He is burning the
candle day and night with very little sleep.  I am praying hard for him and
Enron and know that he has the strength, wisdom, skills and courage to
persevere and succeed.

I will stay in touch.

Love, Linda

Dear Linda,
So much for your quieter time of life.
After seeing the NY Times article yesterday, I am glad for Enron that
Ken is back at the helm; I trust he will persevere and be more than
successful in whatever he does.
I am concerned about his level of stress, and would highly recommend
that he keep up that anxiety control formula, taking two after meals
3x a day. I have stronger things in my arsenal if needed.
Also, perhaps when he is here sometime, I could check his blood
chemistry for stress factors and optimal brain function.
Warmest Regards,
Phyllis
