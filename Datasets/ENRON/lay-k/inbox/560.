I wonder if these imbeciles realize what's going  on in this country or do they find their stupidity more  interesting?
A t t e n t i o n :
This is very scary and is not a joke. Please  read - it definitely is a
serious threat to our lives and health. This is  an alert about a virus
in the original sense of the word...... one that  affects
your body.....not your hard drive. There have been  23
confirmed cases of people attacked by the Klingerman Virus,
a virus  that arrives in your real mailbox, not
in your e-mail inbox. Someone has  been mailing large blue
envelopes, seemingly at random, to people in the  U.S. and Canada.
On the front of the envelope in bold black
letters is  printed " A Gift For You From The Klingerman Foundation".
When  the envelopes are opened, there is a small sponge sealed
in plastic. This  sponge carries what has come to be known as the
and public health  officials state this is a strain of virus
they have not previously  encountered. Those who have come in contact
with the Klingerman Virus  have been hospitalized with severe dysentery. So
far
seven of the  twenty-three victims have died. There is no legimitate
Klingerman  Foundation, mailing unsolicited gifts. If you receive an
oversized blue  envelope in the mail marked "A Gift For You From The
Klingerman  Foundation". Do not open it !!!!! Place it in a strong
plastic bag  or container & call the police immediately. The "gift"  is
one you defiinitely do not want to open.
PASS THIS ON TO EVERYONE  THAT YOU CARE ABOUT!
