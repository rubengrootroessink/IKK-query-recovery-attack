The Value of a Life
=================================================
From CNN's Wolf Blitzer in Washington:

Despite his Democratic Party credentials, it was not a huge
surprise that President Bush and Attorney General John Ashcroft
appointed Ken Feinberg to take charge of one of the most
important and sensitive jobs in Washington. In late November,
Feinberg was tapped to distribute the billions of federal dollars
allocated to the families of those killed in the September 11
terrorist attacks. Feinberg is now the so-called Special Master
of the September 11 Victim Compensation Fund.

Just click here http://www.cnn.com/wolf to read my column
for more on Feinberg's tough job of assessing the value of
the lives lost in the September 11th attacks.

Today, on both editions of Wolf Blitzer Reports, we will take
look at the latest developments in the war against terrorism.
On our 5 PM (Eastern) program, I will speak with former Clinton
deputy national security adviser James Steinberg and former
Assistant Secretary of State for South Asian Affairs Karl Inderfurth.
I will also have a special interview with Democratic Senator
Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, who worked closely with
the president in getting the new education bill passed.

On our 7 PM War Room program, we will examine how
vulnerable the U.S. remains to terrorist strikes. Among my
guests: Gen. Wesley Clark; Los Angeles Times reporter Robin
Wright; and Republican Congressman Saxby Chambliss, who
chairs the homeland security subcommittee.

Please join us tonight and every weeknight at 5 & 7 PM (EST).
Don't forget to answer my question of the day: With al Qaeda on
the run, how vulnerable do you feel? Just go to my website
http://www.cnn.com/wolf to let us know what you think.

Thanks.

Wolf Blitzer
