The Partnership's affiliate 501c3, the Center for Houston's Future, has
embarked on a search for a CEO who can continue the outstanding work
begun by Gene Vaughan, Jim Royer and several other volunteers and staff.

outlined in the attachment. Fellow board member Tom Simmons of Spencer
Stuart has agreed to assist the Center's committee in the search.

We are requesting your assistance in the identification of qualified
candidates for this position.

We are on a relatively short timeline. The committee will identify the
candidates by the 12th of October and then screen and recommend to the
Board of the Center by the regular Board meeting on the 18th of October
or a special meeting on the 24th.

Should you know of a qualified candidate for this position, please
contact me by October 12th at 713/ 844-3601,
