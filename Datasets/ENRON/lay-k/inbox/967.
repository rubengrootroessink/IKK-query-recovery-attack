This young lady was crowned Miss Rodeo America in Las Vegas , Nevada during
the National Finals Rodeo this last month in December. I was honored to be
one of 4 judges that decided she had "it". Now I know I was right. Just
wanted to share this with you. She really is a genuine young lady! Straight
from Athens, Texas. And she's an AGGIE! She was the 2001 Miss Rodeo Texas.
See more about her (http://www.missrodeo.com/reigning.html ).

Cheryl,

  Things have been a whirlwind
since the coronation, but I am loving every minute of
it! I stayed for the entire Wrangler National Finals
Rodeo and spent a lot of time talking to the media and
the sponsors. I was asked on several occasions during
interviews with the press about whether or not I am a
person of faith, and I was very happy to have the
opportunity to give my testimony. I told them that I
knew that I would not have been awarded the
opportunity to speak with them if the Lord wasn't at
work in my life and that I had been very blessed with
wonderful parents who had raised me in a Christian
home.
 I am leaving tomorrow morning to go to Waco for
the Texas Circuit Finals, and I will be flying to
Denver next week. I am really excited that one of my
first appearances is going to be in Houston so that I
get to see all of you! Cheryl, again thank you very
much. You are truly an inspiration to me. I will see
you soon!

Love,
Kara
