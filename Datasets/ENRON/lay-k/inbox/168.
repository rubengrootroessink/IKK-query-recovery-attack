Kenneth:

My name is Brian Skruch with RedDot Solutions.  RedDot provides software
that enables business users to simply maintain their web site by
"clicking on the red dot".  RedDot helps organizations manage and
publish their Web or Intranet content to avoid Webmaster bottlenecks,
inappropriate or costly errors, user frustration etc.  In addition, we
enable content contributors to add, modify, and specify appearance
schedules for Web content without requiring any specific technical
skills such as HTML.

*) For general information on our product, please follow this link:

Please let me know if you would like further information, or if you
would like to setup a meeting to review RedDot in action directly with
your own Enron Corp website.

Thanks,

Brian
