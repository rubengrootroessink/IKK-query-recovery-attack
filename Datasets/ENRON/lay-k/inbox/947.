"Theme Button" and "Budget Button" 
on CDPI Website Aimed at Helping Planners
 
 
Concept Design Productions, Inc. announces  two new improvements  to their 200-plus page website at http://www.conceptdesigninc.com.
 
The new Theme Button is designed to make event planners' jobs easier,  offering more than 1,000 environmental elements and stage sets that are categorized by themes, i.e. Western or Patriotic, Sci-Fi or Gothic, among others.
 
With a simple click, planners can go directly to pages loaded with structural elements meeting the themed criteria they need.  Once there, they can see just what elements are already constructed and ready to rent, or they can view dozens of fabricated environments available to them for a fraction of the cost of custom creation.  
 
Also debuting on the CDPI website in 2002 is the new Budget Button, which allows planners with a set budget to immediately access only those scenic elements that fall within that budget.  It is hoped that such advancements to the existing site will afford planners an easier, more cost-effective use of their time when planning events.
 
Concept Design Productions, Inc. has a 20-plus year reputation as an innovative leader in the event industry.  If you would like more information, we encourage you to access our website, http://www.conceptdesigninc.com .
