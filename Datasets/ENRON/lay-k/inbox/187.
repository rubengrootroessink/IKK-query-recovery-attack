My Mom will be bringing our cousin Elizabeth Bourne to Houston August 5 to
attend Theatre Under the Stars Humphrey School of Musical Theatre with Carl
Benjamin for the week and she would like to see all of you.... I am
wondering what everyone's availability is for an early Sunday evening dinner
August 5 or alternatively, any evening Monday - Wednesday that week.  We
will gladly host a barbecue at our newly remodeled hacienda or if you don't
want/don't have time to make the journey to the 'burbs, we could pick a
restaurant.  Please reply and let me know.

Barbara:  Jeff, Carl and I are looking forward to attending the dinner
Tuesday evening.

Everyone, have a terrific weekend!

Mary Elizabeth

Hello Everyone,
Just a friendly reminder that the Family dinner is
planned for the 12th at the Grotto restaurant in their
private room at 5:30.  Good food and good fun!
Please RSVP by Friday.  David and Courtney I know that
you are not coming but I wanted to include you in the
reminder incase your plans changed.

For those recieving osmars food.  To make thing run
smoothly in his department it is very important that
you return the circle menu by the friday before the
menu starts.  Osmars mondays have been very rushed
while he waits to find out who is eating.  If you know
you are going to be out of town then please email me
or indicate this on the menu and return it to Osmar.

I have completed the holiday house schedule for 2002
and Sally is madly typing as we speak.  I would expect
to see it early next week.

Please note that I will be in Aspen all next week, and
in Canada until the 21st.  If you need to reach me do
not hesitate to call my mobile or email me.

Take Care, Barb
