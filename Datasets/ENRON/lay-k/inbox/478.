Susie Lewis in Exxon-Mobil's Public Affairs Department called me today
for an update on The Center's capital campaign.

Terry Koonce has just passed on to her The Center's funds solicitation
packet for consideration and Susie wanted to know how corporations,
other than Enron, are responding to The Center's request.

I indicated to her that the follow-up calling was just beginning and
that as soon as I could give her an update, I would.  I tried to get
information from her regarding Exxon-Mobil's take on the request.  She
hesitated a bit.  I said that the request was for an effort of the
business community that was unprecedented in the history of Houston.
She agreed and said that Exxon-Mobil has two guiding factors in funding
any effort:  1) the potential for impact on E-M business 2) the
philanthropic value.  She went on to indicate that attracting workforce
to the Houston region was a key necessity of E-M.  She also agreed that
unless this region had a plan, it would be left behind.  She was upbeat,
asked intelligent questions and appeared genuinely interested in and
enthusiastic about The Center's efforts.  She has asked that I call her
back next week.

In addition, Dennis Winkler, Manager, Community Relations - Houston for
Shell (and Partnership liaison for Steve Miller) approached me at the
Partnership's board meeting on Tuesday to chat about The Center.  He
mentioned the fact that Steve Miller had asked him to go to Shell's
Foundation and put Center for Houston's Future in line to receive
funding.  Note:  Dennis did this prior to our solicitation packet being
mailed.

I asked Dennis if Steve had received The Center's solicitation packet
and if so, had Dennis heard any comment.  He said that he didn't know,
but asked for a copy of the packet.  This was sent to him.  I am setting
up a lunch with Dennis next week at his request to talk about The
Center.

Please let me know how to proceed. At this point, I have not received
the final list of your calling preferences.  If I can fill-in or
customize the list for you to facilitate your follow-up telephone
calling effort, please let me know.  I would be more than glad to help.
Thank you for all of your help.
