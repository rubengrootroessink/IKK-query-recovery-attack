Gentlemen:
I look forward to seeing you at our next meeting, which  is scheduled at our usual time, place and room:  Thursday, June 7th,  7:30am, River Oaks CC, Chippendale Room.  
 
Come early for fellowship and feel free to bring a guest (never a breakfast  charge for first-time guests). Our discussion will center on "What does God require?" (Micah 6:8).  Please confirm  your attendance (positive RSVP's only) by return email.
For His Kingdom,
Jack
