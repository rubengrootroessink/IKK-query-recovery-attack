Dear Ken:

I of course still keep very close watch of how Enron is doing.  I am very
sad to see the problems you are facing today particularly since you were
really looking forward to slowing down a bit and spending more time with
your family.

I sincerely appreciate the kindness you showed me while at Enron and the
continued assistance and blessings you have sent my way since leaving Enron.
I will never forget what you have done for me.

Please, if there is any way that I can help you please let me know.  I am
willing to help you in any way you see fit.  When you have a moment of time
I would like to sit down with you and talk to you about some of the areas
that I beleive Enron lost its way and would like to see where you think I
could help you re-establish your vision for Enron.

Please do not consider this note simply kind words.  I sincerely want and
believe that I can help.


Best regards,

Sean
