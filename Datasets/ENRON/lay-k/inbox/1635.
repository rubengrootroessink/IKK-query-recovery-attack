Ken,
 
With every article I read concerning Enron, I think  of you and the obstacles you surmounted in the mid-80s. If you need  help in the Public Affairs arena, my timing is perfect. Peyton and I,  within the last month, moved into our new home in Santa Fe. I am between  commitments to allow time to get settled in the new place. I will be happy to  come to Houston if I can assist you in any way. Hang tough!
 
Every good Wish,
 
Nancy
