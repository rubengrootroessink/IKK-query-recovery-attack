Mr.  Lay,
 
Hello.  Tori left a message requesting me to  send my invitation to you again...we really feel is it vital that now, more than  ever, our top military leaders need to hear from the private sector's top  leaders (like yourself) so that we can learn from their mistakes and  capitalize on their success.  I truly hope you will consider speaking  to this prestigious group of gentlemen who are the decision makers in  our proud military.  I look forward to hearing from  you.
 
Respectfully,
 
Lane  A. Fabby

Dear Mr.  Lay,
 
Hello...On behalf of Barry Frew, founding Director of the Center for  Executive Education (CEE) located at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey,  California, I would like to invite you to be a guest speaker at the CEE for our  Revolution in Business Practices (RBP) Course - we believe you could most  definitely add value to our RBP Course for Executive Education which is a two-  week, high-quality, customized, executive-level program for Flag Officers,  Generals and Senior Executive Service members ( people who truly impact our  military).  We encourage provocative  discussions and would thoroughly enjoy hearing about your experiences and  knowledge regarding leadership, management, job satisfaction, retention, rewards,  etc. 
 
Our upcoming courses are October 22nd-November 2nd,  2001; February 4th-15th, 2002; June  rd-14th, 2002; August 5th-16th,  2002.  We are hoping these dates will work for you during one of  the scheduled courses.  For further  information, our main web site is www.cee.nps.navy.mil .   Additionally, you can find some of our previous speakers (including Larry  Ellison - Oracle, John Chambers - Cisco Systems, Alfred Berkley III - NASDAQ,  etc.) at http://www.cee.nps.navy.mil/speakers.htm .  
 
If you have any questions or need additional information, please give  me a call...I would love the opportunity to tell you more about who we are and  what a difference we are making in the United States military.  I anxiously await your response!  
 
Sincerely,
Lane A. Fabby
