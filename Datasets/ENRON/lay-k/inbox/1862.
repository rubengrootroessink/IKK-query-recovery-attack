Dear Dr. Lay:

Today was Diwali, the festival of lights. As I sat and prayed this
evening my thoughts turned to you and I said a small prayer for all of
my friends at Enron.

I have as you would expect been following the events of the last few
weeks with concern. I wish you all the strength and resolve as you
commit yourself to leading Enron through these difficult times. You have
always been a leader to those who have worked closely with you and have
surely faced more difficult times than these and successfully.

Best Wishes from all of us at THOT Capital,

Sanjay Bhatnagar
