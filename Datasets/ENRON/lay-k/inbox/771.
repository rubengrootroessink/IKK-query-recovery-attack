SUBJECT; RE:INTRODUCTION OF (OAHED)AND REQUEST FOR
FINANCIAL/TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR EFFECTIVE TAKE-OFF
OF ESTABLISHING A LIAISON OFFICE  IN THE GAMBIA.

ATTN:KENNETH

INTRODUCTION
*Organization of African Health and Economic
Development (OAHED), was created with a vision to
coordinates efforts to combat diseases and promote
physical and mental health. Contribute significantly
to eradicate communicable diseases and promoting
improved sanitation and health condition in Africa and
promote economic development.
*OAHED based on a common vision on economic
stabilization strategies and shared conviction , that
(OAHED) have  a pressing duty  to eradicate poverty
and diseases and to place Africa countries both
individually and collectively on the path of
sustainable growth development at the same time
participate actively in the world economy.
*The programmme of (OAHED) is anchored on the
determination  of Africans to extricate themselves and
the continent from the malaise of underdevelopment and
exclusion in the world globalization.
*Poverty and backwardness of African stand in stark
contrast to the prosperity of the developed world.The
continued imagination of Africa from the globalisaton
process and the social exclusion of the vast majority
of its people constitute a serious threat to global
stability.
*In Africa, 365 million peoples or half of the
population live on less than $1.00 per day.The
mortality rate of children under 5years of age is 140
per 1000 and life expectancy at birth is only 54
years. Only 41 percent of the population have access
to safe water, medical care, education etc. The high
rate of illiteracy for people over 15 is 54 percent.
*OAHED calls for the reversal of this abnormal
situation by changing the relationship that underpins
it.African are appealing neither for the further
entrenchment of dependency through aid, nor for
margical concession.
*We are convinced that an historical opportunity
present itself to end the scourge of underdevelopment
that afflicts Africa. The resources, including
capital, technology and human skills that are required
to launch a global war on poverty and underdevelopment
exist in abundance.What is required to mobilize these
resource and use them properly, is bold and
imaginative leadership that is genuinely committed to
a sustained effort of human upliftment and poverty
eradication as well as a new global partnership based
on shared responsibility and mutual interest.
*In the circumstance, Organization of African Health
and Economic Development(OAHED) hereby declare that we
will no longer allow ourselves/African countries to be
conditioned by circumstances. We determine our own
destiny and call on the rest of the world to help and
complement our efforts. There are already signs of
progress and hopes. Democratic regimes that are
committed to the protection of human rights, peoples
centered development and market oriented economies are
on the increase. African people have begun to
demonstrate their refusal to accept poor economic and
political leadership.These development are,  however
uneven and inadequate and head to be further
expedited.
OAHED is about consolidating and accelerating these
gains. It is a call  for a new relationship of
partnership  between African and the international
community, especially the highly industrialised
countries, to overcome the development chasm that has
of course widened over centuries of unequal relations.
*Our perfect knowledge in respect of the high level of
your commitment and goodness in the vineyard of
humanity impressed and impelled us to seek for your
kind assistance to establish the (OAHED) liaison
office in the Gambia.
The materials and funds needed for the effective
take-off are as follow:
1.Cost of renting /furnishing
office??????????.USD$38,000.00
2.Logistics, ie, vehicles???????????????USD$325,000.00
3.Staff emolument, mobility and communication
etc????USD$57,000.00
4.Contingency  (5%)
    Grand Total ???????????????????USD$420,000.00
In the light of this, we are now on board in a
situation not to be described caused by financial
difficulty. We have no facilities neither have we any
money to purchase those materials that are absolutely
necessary in this issue.Your goodness to humanity has
ever been such as leaves not the smallest doubt you
will not suffer us to starve in the situation  you
have been pleased to place us, and which is such as
will ever tend to make us the most grateful/happy and
to ensure success as well as accomplish the set-up
goals.You  will be induced to take this issue into
consideration an urgent intervention in this
impediment, and by a little pecuniary aid, please
save us from this impasse.It will be an act worthy of
your self, and that imprint upon our heart which will
never be erased.
*OAHED will welcome any assistance you render to
enable us put in place the relevant infrastructures
that would enhance the effective and the presence of
Organization of African Health and Economic
Development in the Gambia. Any assistance given should
be considered a worthwhile service to God and Humanity
.If you require any further information or
clarification in any point, please do not hesitate to
ask.

Looking Forward to The Pleasure of your Compliance.

Yours Faithfully

Rev. Emmanuel .  E. Awuruh
CEO/PRESIDENT
ORGANIZATION OF AFRICAN HEALTH AND ECONOMIC
