Lora: I thought several of the reports in the Kamen column in today's  
Washington Post were of interest based on our past contacts which you may  
want to share with Enron officials concerned with those areas. 
(1) Speculation that Otto Reich's nomination for Assistant Secretary of State  
for the Western Hemisphere is in trouble with Senator Joe Biden taking over  
as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Further speculation that  
the Bush Administration may be forced to withdraw the nomination and consider  
replacing it with Crisencio Arcos, a former US ambassador now working for AT  
and T out of Miami. I have met him several times and chaired a BCIU panel  
with him as a participant; Anne Patterson, current US ambassador to Colombia  
who I also know; and, I would add the possibility of Donna Hrinak who I know  
is held in high regard. Doubt that decision will be made for several more  
weeks. 
Further in the column in the information the Nancy Brinker of Dallas (I don't  
know her) is to be nominated as US ambassador to Hungary. Enron has a  
business in Hungary and has been trying to expand interests; our old friend  
Doug Hartwick to be nominated for Laos (you will recall that we tried to help  
him last year to get Senator Bob Smith to remove a "hold" over the Senator's  
upset with the State Department not being aggressive enough about the MIA  
issue); and, my longtime friend Tom Hubbard, former US ambassador to the  
Philippines to be US ambassador to South Korea (Enron's Darrell Kinder may be  
interested to know this information). 
Can you kindly check the White House political office to see if they have a  
contact number for Richard "Rich" Bond? Ken Mehlman's office may be able to  
tell you. Rich did work for us and could possibly be helpful to me in pushing  
my own interests. He's been in the papers and on the tube several times  
commenting on the Jim Jeffords switch. 
We're leaving for our Delaware house about midday today and plan to return on  
Sunday or Monday. 
Thanks. 
Joe
