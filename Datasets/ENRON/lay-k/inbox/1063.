>>WHAT IS HOWARD TALKING ABOUT TODAY?


>NBC4 Hosts Students in "Reality TV" Adventure
Eight Howard University School of Communications (HUSC) students will report
to WRC/NBC4
today with bags in tow, all a bit anxious about the challenges their 13-week
survival course holds for them.
Their bags, however, will be book bags and this is no game show.

The students are enrolled in "Surviving Year One," a new course designed
exclusively for the School of
Communications by NBC4 Vice President of News and Operations Bob Long and
HUSC Faculty Lecturer
John Decker to foster the budding journalists' transition from the classroom
to the fast-paced realities of TV news.
Various NBC4 experts will teach one three-hour class weekly for the next 13
weeks, with topics ranging from
"newsroom dynamics" to "auditions and agents."  "Our students are extremely
sharp," says Dean Jannette L. Dates.
"This rare opportunity will make them even sharper."

>Trustees Host Student Reception (01/17/02)
Howard University Undergraduate Trustee Breana Smith and Graduate Trustee

"A Liberating Prayer:  A Love Song for Mumia" directed by Denise D.
