Ken,

Houston's bid for the 2012 Olympic Games is entering the final phase of the
domestic bid process.  This summer, the United States Olympic Committee
(USOC) will conduct initial site visits and evaluations of the eight U.S.
bid cities with the goal being to cut the number of cities to three or four.
This cut will occur in December of this year.  The USOC will be conducting
Houston's site visit July 16-19, 2001.

This site visit is critical to our ultimate success in bringing the Olympic
Games to Houston.  Over the four-day period in which the USOC site
evaluation team is in Houston, two days will be devoted to venue tours and
presentations.  There are eight presentation topics predetermined by the
USOC, one of which is International Strategy. Simply stated, this is where
we show why we think Houston can win on the international level.

As a Port Commissioner and a board member of Houston 2012, I will be part of
the team that presents this section to the USOC site evaluation team.  As
arguably the most identifiable international corporate leader in Houston and
as the Chairman of the 1990 Economic Summit and the 1992 Republican National
Convention, both of which you left with a positive surplus (very important
to the Olympics), you are in an excellent position to discuss Houston's
international status.

George DeMontrond, Susan Bandy (the Houston 2012 Exec Director) and I would
very much appreciate 15 minutes or so of your time to update you on
Houston's bid efforts and discuss your potential participation in the
upcoming site visit. You are our first and only choice, and I'd like the
opportunity to show you how important this is for Houston. We expect the
number of U.S. bid cities to be reduced to four finalists by this December
as a result of these meetings.  I will call Rosalee to schedule a time for a
visit at your offices. All the best and I look forward to catching up with
you soon. I'm attaching my bio, which details the last few years of activity
I've been involved with, most of which emanated from your support for me on
the UH Board of Regents, the 1990 Economic Summit Host Committee, the 1992
RNC Convention and later the GHP. Thank you for everything you've done for
Sarah and me -- hopefully I've reciprocated by doing a good job for you each
time.

All the best, Vidal
