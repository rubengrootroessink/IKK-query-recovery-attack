Ken, I know the last couple of weeks have been hell but I want to remind you
and Linda that your friends are in your corner. Whatever happens with Enron,
it is a great company and you built it from the ground up. Allot of
investors ( including Nancy and me) made money on the stock in the past and
if some of the money has to be given back, so be it. That's the system. The
good deeds of Linda, Enron and you will be remembered longer than the
problems of the last 3 or 4 months. Good luck ---Jack
