Ken Lay 
Dear Ken, 
         I  know  you are called to serve  on a thousand   boards but Houston needs to at least  borrow your name for a few weeks to kick-start  the effort to safeguard the city as much as possible. All of us  in the med ctr agree we are not nearly prepared.  The group's website http://www.defenseofhouston.org  
has my recent oped and another headed for the NYT, plus the list of members of this ad hoc group, and links to related sites. 
        The other members of this exec group- all agreed- will be dick wainerdi,  jim willerson, ralph feigin, red  duke,  dick ewing(TxA&M VP), ed Djerejian, kirbyjohn caldwell, dan wilford, david persse, john mendelsohn, chaired by  jimmie  baker. Ex-officios will be lee  brown, robert eckels, ken bentsen. 
        Ken  you have already  done more than anyone, much more,  but the use of your  name alone will help in our efforts to bring federal  funds ($1b   available this  fall). 
        We'll meet in the mayor's office at  11:30  and I  would be most grateful if I can  say  you're  on board. THANKS!     Trip
