Ken: 
I am writing to seek coming back to Enron.  I chose retirement in April this year at age 57 because we all thought the stock was going to $120 or thereabouts. We know what happened. 
I was your VP of Engineering for EE&CC under Larry Izzo. 
You might remember me, we last met at your Marco Polo awards dinner, my wife, Brenda, was the one in the Red wheelchair talking with Mr. Kissinger. 
I could help bring some intellectual capital back to Enron and help the company succeed.  My resume is attached. 
I appreciate any consideration you can make. 
Thanks, 
Dennis Alexander
