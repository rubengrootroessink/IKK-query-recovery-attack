"It is the spirit which can bear things, not simply with resignation, but
with blazing hope; it is not the spirit which sits statically enduring in
the one place, but the spirit which bears things because it knows that these
things are leading to a goal of glory; it is not the patience which grimly
waits for the end, but the patience which radiantly hopes for the dawn.  It
has been called "masculine constancy under trial."  It has been said that
always it has a background witch is courage... It is the quality which keeps
a man on his feet with his face to the wind.  It is the virtue which can
transmute the hardest trial into glory because beyond the pain it sees the
goal."  William Barclay
