Dear SUMMIT2001 Invitees and  Guests:
As individuals and as a nation, we have all been irrevocably  affected by the tragic events of September 11, 2001.  ALSTOM was fortunate  in that we did not lose any members of our immediate community (friends, family,  colleagues), and we sincerely hope that this is true for you and your community  as well.  To those of you that have suffered a loss, please accept our  deepest sympathies.
While it is hard at a time like this to think of  conducting business, we have paid heed to the words of President George W. Bush  when he encouraged us, as hard has it may be, to proceed with "business as  usual."  After careful consideration and no small amount of soul-searching,  we have decided to follow the advice of President Bush and move forward with the  SUMMIT2001 meeting in Las Vegas, October 7 - 9, 2001.
Helping us make  this decision have been many attendees, who have sent emails and made calls  encouraging us to proceed with SUMMIT2001.  As you know, we have put  together an agenda that includes an impressive list of speakers, each of whom  has reaffirmed his intention to participate.   For these reasons, we  made the decision to go ahead.  More than ever, it is time for us to  recognize the worldwide importance of our industry.    Through  this forum, we can and will take steps to ensure that we build a stronger  future-together.
