Dear Ken:

I can only imagine the pain you must be enduring during these trying times
at Enron.  I hope that you decide to fight to keep Enron --- "Enron" so that
you can return Enron to the company it once was ... with leaders that
appreciate and live up to important values.  I still believe that you can
restore your reputation to that which represents your true self.

Sincerely,

Sean
