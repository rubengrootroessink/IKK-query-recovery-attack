Ken,

Here is a three page summary of Amory Lovins project at the Rocky
Mountain Institute.  You recall you were going to have someone at Enron
look it over to see if you had any interest in supporting it.  Whoever
gets the task is free to talk with Amory, Kathleen Moazed at the Kirsch
Foundation and the Center for Innovative Policies, or me.

Mr. Seidl --

Attached is the 3 page summary written by Amory.  I will send you the
one-pager we are working on for a Capitol Hill audience when we finalize
it, probably by the end of the day.

Steve's numbers are:
cell:       650.279.1008       (best one to use)

Thanks,
