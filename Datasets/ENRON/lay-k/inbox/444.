Hello  Mr. Lay,
 
In  light of  Enron's incredible success, I am afraid I have been remiss  in not introducing myself and SDL International to you  sooner.

With  720+ full time employees and 29 offices throughout the USA, Asia and Europe  (currently 13 countries), SDL provides globalization solutions with  state-of-the-art technology and a full range of in-house translation  services.
