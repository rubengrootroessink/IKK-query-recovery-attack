Ken,

In addition to the mail I sent you before, just wanted to remind you
that my granfather was George Bush's and Mr. Doyle Mice's partner in
Mandrell Industries, now Zapata Off Shore, 30 years ago.

Regards to you and your family,

Pablo

Dear Ken,

I am a friend of your daugther Elizabeth while she was in Argentina and
I am applying for a job with Eli Lilly in Indianapolis as a  Latin
American Development Manager. I would like to know if there is a
posibility to have a recomendation letter from you since I know you are
from the Board of Directos from Lilly.

I have worked for Enron South America in Argentina and Brazil and
currently runing mu own company. If you believe this is possible just
let me know. I am attaching my cv to you.

Many thanks Ken.

Sincerely,

Pablo Acevedo
