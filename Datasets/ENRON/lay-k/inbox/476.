Mr. Lay,

I hope this finds you well.

We are very interested in having you appear on our upcoming "Tribute to
America" Program on United and American Airlines to begin airing in February
2002.

You will appear along side such prolific thought and business leaders as
Steve Forbes, Stuart Varney, Robert Reich, Willie Brown, Caspar Weinberger,
Russell Lewis (CEO, NY Times) and Al Berkeley (Vice Chairman, NASDAQ).

For more information on the show, please visit:
http://www.skyradionet.com/tribute.html

100% of the profits generated from this show will go to The NY Times 9/11
Neediest Cases Fund.

Please help us restore confidence.  I will follow-up with you next week
regarding your participation.

Sincerely,

Mitch Sodikoff
Sky Radio Network
