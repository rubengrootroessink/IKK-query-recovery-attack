Invited CE World authors,

Many of you have heard by now that ASCE is hosting the 1st Virtual World
Congress for Civil Engineering, CE World (www.ceworld.org). The
call-for-content was issued earlier this summer and the deadline for
submission was September 27, 2001. Although this deadline has passed,
we are still accepting contributions. Go to "Submit Abstracts" on the CE
World web site.


As Content Area Manager for the Geo-Technology area, I invite you to visit
their website to find out more and to submit a contribution. Most content is
expected to be in the form of papers, although you are challenged to "think
outside the box" by including other forms of media. Remember this is a
virtual conference-you do not need to attend; you visit the Congress from
the web. This is a good opportunity to show case your work without having to
travel to present it.

If you are interested in obtaining additional information on CE World, you
can contact me at jtinucci@pantechnica.com or 952-937-5879. Alternatively,
you can contact CE World Content Manager, Walter Marlowe, at
ceworld@asce.org or 703-295-6294.

I hope you will consider this invitation.

Kindest Regards,

John
