Dad,
I met with Peter Veruki at the Jones School of
Administration at Rice last week and we had a great
meeting. Our timing is a little off (they want someone
next spring and I want a position by Jan), but we are
still talking.
There is also a position open for Director of
Development of Rice University and I have contacted
Malcolm Gillis and Christie Patrick happens to be
meeting with him today so she is going to mention that
I am interested.
There are also a couple of positions at UH which I am
going to look into, so I am hopeful something good
will come of all this. Christie Patrick has been my
one woman promoter, she is wonderful.
I'll keep you posted.
I love you Dad,
Elizabeth
