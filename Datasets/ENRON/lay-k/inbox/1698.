Dear Dr. Lay,

The last twelve months have been very difficult times for Enron, particularly for you.  You are often in our thoughts and thank you for keeping us informed of developments on such a regular basis.

I am confident that with your perseverance and unique abilities the Enron boat will soon be sailing in a positive direction again.  Good luck to you and your team.

From me personally and all of us at Enron, New Delhi, we assure you of our continued support.

Regards,

Ashok Mehta
