>
> I'd like to start this month's report with a warm welcome to the 800
> employees of Compaq Financial Services, who "officially" joined the Sales
> and Services team on April 30. I say official, because they've been a
> valued partner with us since the group's founding in 1997, offering
> customers financing and asset management services around the globe. For
> example, you'll see many wins throughout this report that include CFS
> solutions. Earlier this month, I enjoyed meeting the CFS world
> headquarters team in Murray Hill, N.J., and hope to meet many others as I
> travel to the countries. Our continued focus as one team will be to
> present "one face to the customer" as we strengthen our alignment and
> drive even greater value for our customers.
>
> While the market continues to be a real challenge for not only Compaq, but
> for everyone in the industry, it's important that we stay focused on our
> objectives, yet recognize where we are winning. Customer acceptance of our
> technology and solutions continues to be high - note the long list of wins
> this month and our improved marks for customer satisfaction. We have a
> strong global balance, and we're creating unbelievable solutions for
> customers. We're seeing strong front log growth of services, which is a
> real differentiator for us and continues to be the lead element in many of
> our largest wins.
>
> Compaq is taking some tough actions such as the restructuring and reducing
> inventories - steps that will position us for leadership when the market
> rebounds. And we're seeing that same strategy with many of our major
> customers.
>
> Recent studies by Morgan Stanley, Tower Group, Giga and IDC confirm that
> major financial institutions see this as a time to make investments in the
> "right thing" and come out of the economic downturn in a dominant
> position. The December IDC poll of 75 major commercial banks concludes
> that Compaq is ranked No. 1 in the industry in Business Problem Assessment
> and Technology Selection - beating IBM, HP, Oracle and Microsoft. Our
> North America Financial Markets group has been making long-term
> investments in Wholesale Payments Systems, Retail Banking Systems, Capital
> Market Solutions, ZLE for Finance and Wireless for Finance. For more
> information, see

> I know that by staying focused on our customers and doing the right thing
> for Compaq during this challenging time, we will continue to win the

> Great strides in customer satisfaction
> On May 21, Technology Business Research (TBR) released its Q1 2001
> Customer Satisfaction Report focused on Intel-based servers, desktops and
> notebooks. The study is based on interviews that were conducted Jan.-April
> this year with IS/IT professionals and purchasing managers of 515 large
> U.S. companies (1000+ employees). TBR reported that Compaq achieved
> ratings increases in all categories - servers, desktops and notebooks -
> the only major player (Dell, IBM, HP) to do so.
> *	ProLiant servers once again led the industry-standard server market
> in customer satisfaction.
> *	Compaq moved from 4th place to 2nd place in desktops
> *	Compaq satisfaction in notebooks improved slightly and we are now
> rated #2
>
> The study notes that, "A striking aspect of this quarter's analysis is the
> great distance at which Compaq has exceeded the competition for parts
> availability, scalability, server management, and overall hardware
> reliability" and in the consistency of its customers' satisfaction from
> quarter to quarter "while its competitors continue to show vulnerability
> to eroding customer satisfaction for the second consecutive quarter."

> EMEA CS Channels Marketing and Sales
> In terms of dollars, these marketing activities in some of our smaller
> EMEA countries may not have the largest impact, but they do provide a
> tremendous boost to the business locally. They also highlight excellent
> examples of best practices that can be leveraged by other countries.
> *	Portugal - CarePaq Outbound Telemarketing Campaign - A trial program
> involving a dedicated local Call Centre agent contacting 800 pre-screened
> warranty-only customers approaching the end of the first year of warranty
> resulted in the sale of 129 new CarePaqs (17% conversion). Plans are to
> roll out this program in other EMEA countries.
> *	Finland - Electronic CarePaq Growth - Three-fourths of all CarePaq
> sales in Finland are now in the form of electronic CarePaq sales. A May
> Day advertising campaign in national press featuring eCarePaq alongside
> hardware resulted in 600 new eCarePaq sales equating to an incremental
> CarePaq attachment rate increase of 5%. As other EMEA Countries mirror
> Finland's leadership position on eCarePaq penetration, similar campaigns
> are planned.
> *	South Africa - iPAQ CarePaq Bundle - To provide further competitive
> differentiation and to improve customer satisfaction, CS Channels
> Management in South Africa has agreed to bundle a one-year Advance
> Exchange CarePaq on iPAQ handhelds, which is forecast to improve CarePaq
> revenue by $270K or 25% for the year.
> *	Spain - Presario Bundle - To drive customer satisfaction and loyalty
> and to provide a unique differentiator in the marketplace, Spain will
> bundle a 2-year, pick-up and return, five-business-day CarePaq on all
> Presario portable sales. Initially, 6,500 are planned to ship in May, with
> a total of 17,000 units in 2001. This will generate incremental CarePaq
> revenue of nearly $700K and add approximately 10% to the annualized
> CarePaq attachment rate.

>
> 	IBM's acquisition of Informix - Compaq's position and field advice
> On April 24, IBM announced its intention to purchase Informix Software.
> Compaq and Informix have had a long relationship in the database market,
> and have many mutual customers that have implemented mission-critical
> applications based on Compaq/Informix data management solutions.
> Naturally, many of these accounts are concerned about IBM and Informix's
> long-term commitment to supporting Informix products on Compaq platforms.
