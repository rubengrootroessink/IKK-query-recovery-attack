I understand you plan to attend the meeting on May 11th at Brennans.  I
would like to put you down for another update on the energy industry
situation....nothing of more interest to our group and of great
importance to Houston and all of us.  Thank you in advance!!  (if
something comes up at the last minute and you can't make it...I'll just
fill in with something else.)  Regards, R
