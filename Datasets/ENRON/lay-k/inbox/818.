 Teamwork Newsletter  NOVEMBER 2001 =09
  Trust is the fuel that moves companies forward  Business is down. Layoffs=
 loom. Employees are focusing on their family, and many fear losing their j=
obs. Yet, you need to move your company or your department forward. You nee=
d to move upward and onward. What does it take? Trust! We suggest that it i=
s Trust that allows the balance between the opposing demands of work and qu=
ality of life.   As always, moving forward requires a balance of effectiven=
ess vs. efficiency and short-term vs. long-term goals. A closely connected =
tenet of these four is trust and getting to trust is a process that can be =
worked on.  The ability to work  towards the future as a team requires trus=
t because the future is pure promise, and has no reality in the here and no=
w. Without trust, there can be no agreement concerning future events. After=
 all, certain real, clashing interests will be sacrificed in the short term=
, for an unreal future built on promises. Trust is the factor that permits =
common goals to benefit both parties.  Thus, conflicts of interest are reso=
lved through common goals pursed in an atmosphere of mutual trust. Those wh=
o understand capi (coalesced authority, power and influence) know that it n=
aturally gives rise to conflicting interests. To get things done, a team mu=
st have common goals or interests to bind them together. Mutual suspicion m=
ust give way to mutual trust.  As we well know, the bearers of various impl=
ementation forces come into conflicts that simply do not get resolved. When=
 fundamentally different interests are at issue, resolution often seems imp=
ossible. There are no obvious or immediate win-win solutions. In fact, Dr. =
Adizes makes the bold declaration that when conflict arises among people wi=
th different interests, the short-term outcomes can never satisfy both part=
ies. In the short term, conflicting interests can only be addressed by a co=
mpromise, where both parties? interests suffer, or by a win-lose scenario t=
hat leaves one party seriously disgruntled.  Destructive conflict over diff=
erent interests manifests itself as long, drawn out tensions between the di=
fferent players. The conflict will not go away. The trick is to harness tha=
t conflict to achieve something, rather than trying to pretend that it does=
 not exist. Avoiding conflict is not the secret. Encouraging constructive c=
onflict is the way to move forward. Trust is the only path to constructive =
conflict in a situation of different interests.  However, trust can only be=
 earned over time. To establish trust, one must establish a history of livi=
ng up to promises. Since trust can be eroded in a split second, making the =
pursuit of common goals increasingly difficult, one must move slowly and ca=
refully and in a non-threatening manner as one builds that history of trust=
