I was told by you that our expenses were going to get paid ( as per your voice mail ).  However, I was laid off from Enron Europe last Friday with another 800 people and we were told that our expenses were not going to be repaid by the company.


Can you please explain the conflict between the two messages and let me know who will reimburse me.  I am owed ?7000 from Enron
