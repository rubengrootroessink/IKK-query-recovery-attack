Ken:

I know you have tons of problems right now, but don't forget about us Retired
Employees who have banked on Enron Inactive Medical benefits.

Are these continuing?  Will Enron and the court honor these commitments to
past employees?

You can either answer direct or thru your Internet site with your daily
updates.

Thanks,

Dennis Alexander
