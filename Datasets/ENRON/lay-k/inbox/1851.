Hi Mr. Lay,
 
I just wanted to say how much I appreciate your gesture regarding the $60 million.  It has been a true pleasure working for a man with such integrity and geniune concern for his employees.  
 
My heart goes out to you as I can't begin to imagine the sense of loss you must be feeling.  I am however, aware of our (your employees) loss, as I'm sure we will never again experience someone of your character and magnitude.  
 
God Bless.
 
Sincerely,
 
Gerri Gosnell
