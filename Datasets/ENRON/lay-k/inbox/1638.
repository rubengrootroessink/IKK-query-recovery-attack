> Ambler, in particular, he was very impressed however there was simply no
> position available. I know that Enron is always in the need for
> outstanding people. I guarantee you that I am one. I can make a difference

> have submitted my information several times via the internet, but have
> rarley gotten any response. So I figure why not go to the top. I
> understand that you are extremly busy, but I also know great companies are
> made up of great people, why not add one.  I thank you in advance for
> letting me bend your ear. Take care, don't worry the market will rebound
