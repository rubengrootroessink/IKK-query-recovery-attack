Dear Ken,

Good morning.  Today is a new day!  I know yesterday and the entire past week have been extremely difficult for you, your family, and the entire Enron family.  I just wanted you to know that I'm keeping you in my thoughts and prayers.  We all are extremely fortunate to have you as a leader and continue to support you stronger than ever as you navigate us through this time.  As you mentioned yesterday, times like these make us stronger and build character - so important for all employees to remember.  Please know that I will do whatever possible to carry that message forward. 

Best Regards, 

Kathy
