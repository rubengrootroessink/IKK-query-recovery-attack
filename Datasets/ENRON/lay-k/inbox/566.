Dear Ken, 
I have sent you two emails and a package last week.  I have not heard from you via email so am wondering if you have received anything?  I hope so.  I will make a copy of the past emails and send them to you by mail if you would prefer.  I can also put together a whole proposal if you need me too.  Just let me know via email if you can.  I understand that you must get hundreds of emails a day.  I hope this does not burden you in the least.  I remain hopeful that Laura will grace us in April.   
Thanks again. 
Serving Him, 
Barbara T. Collins
