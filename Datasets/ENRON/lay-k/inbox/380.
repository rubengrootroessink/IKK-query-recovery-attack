Ms. Olson-

I want to thank you for following up concerning my tuition reimbursement for the University of Chicago MBA program.  I am very appreciative of the concern, respect, and professionalism shown me by you, Mr. Lay, and Enron, and look forward to many more successful years at Enron.

Sincerely,

John Carlson
