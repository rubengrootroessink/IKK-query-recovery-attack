A outside source suggested to me that I, as a stockholder, should
E-Mail my senator and request the government's help to bail out
Enron. After all they bailed out Chrysler, the airlines, and many
other companies and are helping Afghan. Enron was the 
7th largest company in the US. The government should help 
Enron while we restructure.

Can Enron E-Mail all employees and stockholders and request 
they E-Mail their Senator &/or Congressman and suggest the above.
