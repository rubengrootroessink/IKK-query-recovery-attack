Rosie,

I have very patiently explained the situation to Wayne Rogers and Craven Crowell on behalf of the former Vice President.  I will call them again tomorrow, hopefully with a little more positive news and the possibility of being able to see some information some time next week.  I am sorry that Dr. Lay has been bothered by this.

Take care,
Mark

Ken--

At the conclusion of our phone conversation, you indicated that I should get
back with you if we were having any difficulty in pursuing our interest in
acquiring the Enron wind business.  Knowing the many demands on your time, I
regret to have to come back to you.  However, despite repeated attempts, we
are still locked out of negotiations over the wind asset and have been
unable to receive information we've requested.  Our phone calls have been
returned, but information and/or a seat at the table have not been
forthcoming.

Can we discuss this again by pbone?  Alternatively, as I suggested in a note
to you on Monday, we stand ready at any moment to come visit you in person
about this if you might have even 15 minutes for us.

Again, apologies for coming back to you about this.  But, it would be
extremely helpful if you could assist us in being able to move forward on
our interest in bidding on this business.

Many thanks!
Katie McGinty

In a note to you on Monday, I expressed a desire to speak to you about  so

asset and/or if we were failing to get in to the negotiations that we
understand to be underway regarding the sale of this asset.
In my earlier note to you I was inquiring about the possiblitiy that the
wind asset would be auctioned.  I want to expandbe clear here and reiterate
our intentions:  while we believe that an open-ended auction would be
unnecessarily costly and inefficient for Enron and for potential bidders,
our overriding interest is in being able to bid on Enron wind, period.  I am
contacting you again as you suggested in our phone conversation since we
have, to date, been unable to get information on the asset and we have been
unsuccessful in getting the negotiations (that we understand might already

ready to do this deal.  Following our conversation, my partners have had
several phone conversations with Mr. Metts, reiterating our interest in the
asset (that they had expressed to him in a meeting on November 14), and
asking for information so that we could prepare a bid.  To date, we have not
received any information and we've been unable to Currently, despite our
repeated expressions of interest in this asset, that we discussed by phone
