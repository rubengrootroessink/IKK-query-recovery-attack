Newly appointed Asst. Secretary for EERE, David Garman, is urgently seeking
input on the 31 programs administered by his department.

Do not miss this opportunity to provide written and/or oral comments on the
program objectives, deployment, and if programs are meeting their objectives
as well as recommendations for future objectives and implementation. [See
Public Notice Attached]. Your input will be used to help determine the
future of these programs, identify new programs, and provide the basis
hopefully for a DOE supplemental budget increase.

A.  Seven public meetings will be held around the country from June 12th  -
Jun 26th.  You should at a minimum submit your recommendations in writing to
DOE [instructions contained on page 2 of the announcement].
B.  Be as specific as possible and cite success stories as well as failures.
Brief comments are also welcome to show general support and/or need for
improvement or termination.  Please be as constructive as possible to help
restore funding for those programs you support.
C. Please provide me with copies of any written comments by email so the
Alliance can hopefully incorporate your suggestions in our written comments
as well.

This is one of the most important and timely opportunities you will have to
impact these programs.  Asst. Secretary Garman needs our input!  Feel free
to contact me with any questions by email or calling 202-530-2213.
