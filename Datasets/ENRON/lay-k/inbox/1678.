Ken- I am a Director at EES and have been at Enron for 9 years. I am extrem=
ely proud of Enron and our many successes. The creativity and collective br=
ainpower at Enron is unmatched in the industry. I attended the All Employee=
 meeting you held before I left for vacation.  I left with a strengthened r=
esolve and commitment to Enron. I thought a lot about your very effective h=
andling of the issues in front of us. I am extremely disappointed in many o=
f the prevailing negative attitudes internally and particularly some of the=
 terribly disrespectful questions and comments thrown at you in the meeting=
. You as always handled the situation with grace, humor and poise. You have=
 tremendous support internally despite what I perceive to be a relatively s=
poiled group of people who have no concept how good we all have it despite =
our current issues. I have total faith in our management team and am happy =
to see a very proactive offensive underway. Thank you for your commitment t=
o Enron and know that many of us long term employees know from experience w=
e will beat these challenges. The daily communication updates are forthrigh=
t and honest and help people better understand what is going on.=20

I hope you can disengage and find some enjoyment this weekend!
