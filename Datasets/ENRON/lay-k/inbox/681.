Dear Mr. Lay,

I am contacting you regarding Enron Energy Services' possible speaking
participation as a at this exciting new event.  Telecom Energy: Strategies
to Reduce Power Consumption, Cut Operating Cost and Improve System
Performance will be held November 8-9, 2001 in Atlanta, Georgia at the Hyatt
Regency Hotel.

Below is the suggested session that in which Enron could participate as a
speaker.  We would like to confirm you on this session, or if you see a
different session which is not listed here on the program let us know which
one you are interested in.  Please review the following:

Day one, Thursday, November 8, 2001
12:30 - 1:00 p.m 		Implications of Telecom Growth for the Electric Power
Industry:
The intent of this session is to utilize the data and experience from the
last session (Power Consumption: Service Provider's Perspective), and place
it in a national going-forward analysis of a 3- year and 5-year prediction.
Power Providers in the audience will understand what service provider growth
issues will mean for power production and transmission. What are the hot
growth areas, geographically and demographically?

I have attached a copy of the conference agenda for you to review.  Feel
free to email any suggestions as well.  For additional information please
check out our conference website at www.shorecliffcommunications.com/tenergy

Please confirm your participation as soon as possible, preferably by the end
of this week or the beginning of next week, as speaking positions will fill
quickly.  We would love to see your name included on the brochure to go to
print next week.  When you respond with the sessions of interest please
include the correct spelling of your name and title  I will also need your
full contact information so I am able to send you confirmation of your
speaking opportunity.  As soon as possible if not along with your initial
response I will need a brief biography and photo of you along with a brief
company profile.  Please keep the bio and profile down to 50 - 60 words max
