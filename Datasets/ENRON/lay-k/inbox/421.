programs designed to serve low to middle income Houstonians.  Initially

to the total man."  Technology For All-Houston is proud to be a partner in
this effort.

Houston on the development of collaborative relationships with
community-based organizations serving Houston's low-income underserved
population. With each organization TFA-Houston has helped develop a
technology and program plan that will serve the needs of the community.

For All (TFA) and others.

TFA-Houston is the local affiliate of TFA.  Together they have also
developed key supportive relationships with the Houston Technology Center,

Museum and the Houston Area Technology Advisory Council of the Greater
Houston Partnership.   Each of these collaborative relationships help
provided added value to the support that TFA and TFA-Houston bring to local

communities.

TFA and TFA-Houston include local YMCAs, community centers, churches, faith
based social service agencies, community development organizations and

"Technology For All-Houston is supported in its mission to bring technology
to underserved communities by many Houston corporations, who redeploy
computers back into the community through TFA," says Will Reed, President
and CEO of TFA/TFA-Houston.  The generous support TFA's donor base of
individuals, foundations, and corporations comes from many, including
Houston Endowment, the Linda and Ken Lay family, the M.D. Anderson
Foundation, the Vivian Smith Foundation.  Corporate sponsors include Enron,
SmartForce, FYI-Net, ExxonMobil, Shell, BP and many others.  New corporate

ALLISON AND TERRORIST ATTACKS IMPACT FUNDING

Technology For All and Technology For All-Houston have both been impacted by
the important support that foundations and corporations have given to flood
relief and terrorist victim support.

To do its part, both organizations have reduced monthly operating expenses
through staff attrition, voluntary salary reductions by senior staff and
other means.  Both organizations are also working to increase both cash and
in-kind donations in an effort to weather the storm of funding reductions
brought on by the difficult events of recent months.
