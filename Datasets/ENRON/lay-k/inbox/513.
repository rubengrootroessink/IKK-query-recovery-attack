Ken and Tori:
I am very pleased that you are willing to try to arrange for yourself,
Ken, or someone come to guest lecture in the course Don Tapscott and I
are teaching.
Per your email of sept 21, I know that Nov 16 doesn't work.
I responded on sept 23 that the two other days that would fit in the
course schedule are Oct 12 and Nov 2.
If I could now ask you a big favor and that is that I need to nail down
an Enron date so that I can juggle the other speakers accordingly.  So
if at all possible, I would dearly love to hear by the end of this week.
Thanks so much for helping. R.
