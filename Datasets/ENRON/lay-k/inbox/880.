 Dear Kenneth,
Global security and disaster response are now more urgent than ever, requiring the participation of many countries, governments, agencies, companies, and organizations. You are therefore invited to participate in The Global Security & Disaster Response Summit, scheduled for March 24-26, 2002 at the Washington Convention Center in Washington, DC.
The Summit is the premier global forum in 2002 to bring corporate, military, and government leaders together on the worldwide response to the September 11 terrorist attack against the United States. Summit highlights include: 
[IMAGE]	Safety of air/land/sea travel.	
[IMAGE]	Security of our major economic sectors, including aviation, transportation, IT infrastructure, energy, banking, agriculture, and water management.	
[IMAGE]	Security of executives and companies.	
[IMAGE]	Bioterrorism, the threat of chemical and nuclear terrorism, and how the corporate sector should respond.	


In addition to major general sessions and workshops featuring top U.S. and international speakers on these subjects, the Summit will include key procurement officials and other top decision-makers who control new multi-billion-dollar security and disaster response programs.
No other event in the world during 2002 will provide you with the information, contacts, strategies, and financing to be found at The Global Security & Disaster Response Summit.
