Dear Mr. Lay,

Greetings from Canada.

I had forwarded a letter yesterday to enquire your interest in obtaining
the services of Mr. Jack Welch (GE) to head up an independant committee
to review the limited partnership liabilities for Enron.

Please indicate if you are interested in this proposal.

If not, what is your plan to address the confidence crisis in disclosure
at this time?

Sincerely,
*********************************************************************
