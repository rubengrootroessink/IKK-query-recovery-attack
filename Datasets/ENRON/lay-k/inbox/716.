Dr. Lay,
What a joke ... Do realize how lives you and your
board of directors have ruined >>>> all because of
greed and power .... I looked up to for a while
building a great company nice place to work  but then
greed got in your way ... Lets hear again why Skilling
quit ?? because of family ... BS. Over the past ten
years i have worked at
Enron as a computer contractor in payroll and i saw
the outlandish executive bonuses and money to the
islands.  I hope you get justly fined and sent to
prison for the fraud you have committed. The few
shares
of enron i have left are not worth the paper they are
printed on.....i also saw all the stock options you
and the board have excersied over thats few years 100s
of million dollars what a shame ...
  When you opted to replace the oracle Payroll with
SAP I new you were loosing your mind ....

all the great people that made you now have to find a
job replace their retirement and hope for the best.

I hope we never meet ...

craig cannon a stock holder
