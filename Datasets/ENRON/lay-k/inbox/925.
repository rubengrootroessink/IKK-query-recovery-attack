Dear Ken: 
Although Harmolyn and I have wanted to pass on some words of friendship for some time, we did not want to intrude for even a moment as you worked to deal with your problems. 
We could not, however, let the holiday season past without saying that you know where we are and how to reach us. And I think you know that we are fully ready to help in any way we can in the weeks and months ahead. 
You will be interested in knowing that Brudder Pete called me on my 78th (Christmas eve) and he sounded twenty years younger than when I saw him in September. 
                                                        Charly
