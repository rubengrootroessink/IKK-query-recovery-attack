Welcome to the June 2001 issue of e-Hong Kong, the electronic newsletter of the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in San Francisco. This issue includes some background on the new Chief Secretary for Administration and the Financial Secretary who just came on board, as well as Brand Hong Kong, a major new program to focus international attention on Hong Kong's drive to be Asia's world city. There is coverage of the Fortune Global Forum held in May, and much more.

We have also provided links to the most recent economic data from Hong Kong and updated forecasts as well.
