Hi Ken,

Many of my team appreciated your voice mail today.  I think they appreciated your candor about Andy, and more importantly, they appreciated your tone.  I think it would be helpful if you left frequent (weekly, or so) general updates to the degree you can.

Mike and I had a very successful floor meeting today, and so many of our employees came up to us after to mention their appreciation of our having such a meeting.

Your voice mails are great, and we need to use you more often.  I'd love (and I'm sure I speak for Mike on this) for you to attend one of our weekly staff meetings in the near future.

Of course, if there is anything I can do to help, please let me know.

Regards,

Jeff
