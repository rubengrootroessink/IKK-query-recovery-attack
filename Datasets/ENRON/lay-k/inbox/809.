Dear Mr. Lay,

I went home yesterday along with the other 3,999 employees who lost
their jobs at Enron.  Even though we had weeks to prepare for the worst,
when the layoffs occurred, it really hit me hard.

I cried a great deal, not only about the uncertainty of my future, but
for the loss of relationships and friendships that I had established
over the last five years I spent at Enron.  The hardest aspect of
yesterday was saying "goodbye" to my friends and co-workers.

We've all made a resolution to stay in touch and hopefully we will all
pick up the pieces and carry on with our lives.

I appreciate the efforts that were made to get us some severance, but as
you are well aware, gave so much of ourselves to the company and lost so
much in return..

I'm sure I'm not alone in encouraging you and Enron management to
continue to push for additional severance for those of us who lost our
jobs.  This is a hard time to hit the street looking for a job, while
Continential, Compaq and now Enron have downsized and the holidays are
upon us.

I know you have probably received this kind of message  many times in
the last few weeks, but I hope you will continue to do the right thing
for the employees.  We need the additional severance to be able to
ensure food on the table and roofs over our heads until we can land on
our feet after this free fall.

I will never regret my 5 years at Enron.  They are an important part of
my past.

I appreciate your consideration of this request.

Sincerely,

Kathleen Pope-Sance
ex-Manager
Enron Energy Services
