Mr. Lay,

Even though this will in all probability never even be read, I would still like you to know I am proud to have at least been part of Enron. I am a foreigner and came to work for you a year ago exactly. I can clearly remember how all I knew here said how lucky a <beep> I was to work for the most safe and good company in all of Texas and probably way beyond it. I am from the Netherlands and what I call 'imaging', was unknown to me. Still, here I am, now fully cooperating by being very proud to work for my company, Enron. 

These are trying times for all of us. It is hard to even smile back at people that make cheerful little jokes about the situation we are in. When something negative is being said, I'll be there jumping the barricades defending what I know Enron to be. Unfortunately, in the wee hours when there is nothing left to fight and all you can do is wonder about what the heck is going on, I become upset. Upset with myself for defending Enron while I have no idea what I am talking about. All we all know is what we read online, see on the news and read in the paper. Usually people outside know more than we right here at that, according to your emails, powerful pumping and beating heart committed to get us out of the predicament we are in. 

Now, I ask you, is there anyway you can give us a little more of that Enron feeling? We all know that we have to prepare for the worst, but nobody knows anything so to say. Even if we stay loyal and try and not update that resume and not look for jobs, we don't know what is the least that we can expect at the end of the day. Sure, it must be possible for us to go and find out online what the little rules are and guess what we can expect. Instead how about doing that 'imaging' again. Us being proud that even if we end up being let go, that we were informed and knew what was coming. Bestow on us that what you gave us the first day we came in: Our Values.

With kind regards,

Guido Govers
