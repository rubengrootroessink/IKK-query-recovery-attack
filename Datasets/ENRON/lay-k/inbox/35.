In order to prepare a paper for my graduate class on Leadership, I recently had an opportunity to visit with Stan Horton. Stan provided some wonderful insight on his leadership skills and gave you as an example of a superb leader. He suggested that I also speak with about your views on leadership. Some questions that would be of interest would be what events you think coelesced to bring you to the chairmanship of Enron; what developmental process you knowingly (or unknowingly) went through in your early years and what challenges have you encountered that made a signficant change in your career.

If you would have fifteen minutes or so and would be amenable, I would much appreciate visiting with you in the next two-three weeks. If you wish, I could provide you questions in advance to maximize your time.

Thank you for considering this request.
