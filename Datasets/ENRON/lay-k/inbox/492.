Dear Dr Lay,

Thank you very much for your prompt response concerning the Preparatory
Meeting for the Energy Governors Meeting in Davos. Of course, I am fully
aware what a long way it is to go for a one-day meeting from Houston to
Geneva.

However, in order to prepare a successful Governors Meeting, the issue
selection is primordial. I am pleased that among the first confirmations
for the Preparatory Meeting we received confirmations from ABB Ltd, ENI
SPA, Royal Dutch/Shell, Saudi Aramco, Statoil Group, Ruhrgas, some of which
will be represented by their top-executives. Nevertheless, in order to have
a representative overview on issue priorities I would very much appreciate
your feedback on the issue list that had been attached to the invitation
for the Preparatory Meeting. (I re-attach it to this email.)

(See attached file: issues.doc)

I will participate at this years World Energy Congress in Buenos Aires.
Should you be planning to be there, it would be a great pleasure for me to
meet with you on this occasion in order to get an in-depth feedback on your
specific interests concerning the Energy Governors Meeting. I will stay at
the Reconquista Plaza hotel (Tel.: 54 11 4311 4600 / Fax: 54 11 4311 3302).

Should you have any questions concerning the Governors Meeting, please do
not hesitate to contact me any time.

Yours sincerely,
Christoph Frei
