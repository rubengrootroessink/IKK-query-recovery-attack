ecent layoffs at Enron.  I  along with two other ex-employees (Karen Cutler=
 and Sue Nix) have been working  on a project which will provide assistance=
 to ex-employees of Enron. We wanted  to do something to help our fellow em=
ployees and also provide a tool that others  could use to provide assistanc=
e to ex-Enron employees. This week, we've been  working with an attorney an=
d a local bank. An account has been set up where  people can make contribut=
ions. All the money will be given back to ex-Enron  employees that need ass=
istance with basic necessities, such as money for food,  rent/mortgage paym=
ents, and utilities. We've contacted the local media with the  information =
so that the community can be made aware of what we're doing. Our  ability t=
