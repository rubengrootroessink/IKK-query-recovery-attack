Dear Mr. Lay,
 
First of all....thanks.  I haven't been here as long as you, but I've been here a while...14yr.  It's been a great experience and I want you to know how much I appreciate you and your leadership.
 
I too will be here, as you say, "until they run me off" or until we get through the other side.  It's a tough situation and I guess there's no guarantee we'll make it but it won't be because we didn't give it all we had or that we didn't do the right thing.  
 
You take care of yourself,
Greg
