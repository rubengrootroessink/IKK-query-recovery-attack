What If Congress Were Obliterated?

Monday, October 22, 2001, 3:00*4:30 p.m.
American Enterprise Institute, Twelfth Floor, Wohlstetter Conference Center
1150 Seventeenth Street, N.W., Washington, DC 20036

Moderator:
Norman Ornstein, American Enterprise Institute
Panelists:
Rep. Brian Baird, U.S. House of Representatives (D-Wash.)
Rep. Doug Bereuter, U.S. House of Representatives (R-Nebr.) invited

What if the terrorists had succeeded in flying an airplane into the Capitol, killing or incapacitating many members of the House of Representatives and the Senate? Our Constitution and laws have only makeshift and incomplete provisions for Congress to convene, do business, and make laws under those circumstances. This is no academic problem:  among the last things the United States needs in the aftermath of a terrorist attack is the enduring absence of national leadership. At this event a panel will discuss the security and constitutional issues surrounding a deadly attack on Congress.  Norman J. Ornstein will discuss issues raised in his recent pieces on the subject in Roll Call (http://www.rollcall.com/pages/columns/ornstein/) and the Washington Post. Congressman Brian Baird will present his recently introduced constitutional amendment to allow Congress to function under such an emergency.
