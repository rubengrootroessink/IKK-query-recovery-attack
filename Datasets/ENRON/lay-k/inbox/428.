Ken,

John mentioned that he contacted you recently to introduce my firm, myCFO.
We'd welcome the opportunity to meet with you, discuss your wealth
management needs, and present our unique approach and expertise.  I think
you'll find the time well spent.

We provide unbiased, comprehensive wealth services to a limited number of
high-net-worth individuals --- with outstanding client satisfaction as our
key focus. Over 85% of our clients (whose wealth averages $80-100 million)
have already recommended us and Bloomberg recently rated us the largest and
fastest growing independent wealth management firm in the U.S.

We also have a Strategic Advisory Services group that helps clients review
and implement best-in-class tax planning ideas for clients that have
recently sold considerable wealth.

Ken, would you be willing to meet with our team?

Best regards,

Art
