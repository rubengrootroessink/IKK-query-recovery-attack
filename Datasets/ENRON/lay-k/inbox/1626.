Rosie - I leave it to you and Steve to determine whether or not to show this to Mr. Lay.  This is indeed a stinging letter which may serve no purpose being showed to Mr. Lay at this point.  We will determine where this gentleman worked, if there were any other issues involved, and will get back to you.  Please let me know if the author tries to call or sends mail/package.

							Thanks -  John

I don't want to show this one to Ken.  This guy sounds really angry, though, and wants Ken to write him back.

Dear Mr. Lay ---

As a recently terminated employee of Enron, I have watched the stock's
dramatic tumble in the last weeks mount on top of the horrible performance
over the last months.  As Chairman and CEO, you are ultimately responsible
for everything that goes on in the company.  Without getting into the
potentially criminal and certainly ill-conceived activities of you and other
Enron executives, past and present, I think you have done little but pay lip
service in order to correct things.

Mr. Lay, you and the other executives receive very large salaries.  None of
you is hurting for money.  I think it unconscionable that you and other
executives continue to draw a paycheck.  While employees and others like me
have seen our net worth go from respectable sums to zero, you remain wealthy
beyond most of our dreams.  What's worse, you take more from the company
every week in the form of pay.  I realize you haven't had a soul in quite
sometime.  But are you so unconcerned with the well-being of the people like
me who believed in you and worked years and years for you, that you feel
justified adding insult to injury?  You have literally ruined the lives of
thousands of people.  Your employees deserve better than this!  I was
terminated at mid-year because my book was losing $2 million.  That's right,
$2 million!  That's after I'd made tens of millions for you over the past
eight years.  You and yours have lost me more than that of my own personal
money now.  I don't quite know how to fire you.

It's obvious that neither you nor any other executive currently in power at
Enron have any credibility whatsoever.  Cutting off difficult questions on a
conference call or ignoring pointed questions from employees don't go along
way in restoring any credibility or respect.  There is none left, and yet
you continue to take money out of the Enron coffers for yourself in the form
of compensation.  The hubris there is so incredible to me that it defies
comprehension.

Why, exactly, is Enron paying you?  Do you feel justified being paid by
Enron?  Do you feel justified seeing Enron pay large sums of money to others
involved while those of us with our retirement and childrens' education
funds tied up in Enron suffer more?

I worked at Enron from May of 1993 until this month.  I watched my net worth
increase substantially with my hard work at Enron.  Now, in the blink of an
eye, my net worth has plummeted to levels I haven't experienced since long
before I went to work at Enron.  I worked there for nearly nine years and
now have nothing to show for it.  Well, that's not entirely true.  I have
learned a valuable lesson.  I will never put my faith in someone again like
I did in you.  I now know that you couldn't care less about the well-being
of your employees.  You do still, however, show an incredible capacity for
greed.  You continue to rob the company of funds that could be going to more
useful places.

As I said, I was terminated because my book had $2 million in losses YTD
based on a couple of bad trades and some bad positions I inherited.  In this
pay-for-performance world, where does that leave you?  You continue to
enrich yourself while losing billions of dollars every single day.  I
imagine the PRC would have looked poorly on me if I lost 10-30% of the
company's value each day the market was open.

I no longer work for Enron, but I am left holding the bag with a ton of
worthless options and shares in my 401(k).  I only have a short time in
which to exercise those options.  I don't have the luxury of waiting for
enough good news to come out of the company to make them valuable.  I'm just
one of the thousands upon thousands of financial lives you've ruined.  The
very people that have made you rich you have made poor.  And somehow, you
seem to smile as you keep doing it!

I'd like your response as to why you feel it necessary for you and notable
others to continue to take money from the rest of us in the form of a
paycheck.  Please write me back.

Sincerely,


Scott Hendrickson
