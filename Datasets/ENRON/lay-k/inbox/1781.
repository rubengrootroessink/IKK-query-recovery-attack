Mr. Lay:

Congratulations doesn't seem quite right, but I do want to express my best
wishes over your recently announced merger with Dynegy. I am confident you have
made the best decision for the long term success of Enron's employees,
stockholders, and their families. The fact that you have chosen to unite with
annother quality Houston company also gives me confidence that leading edge
community involvement we have come to expect from both Enron, and Dynegy will
continue for years to come. Hopefully with both companies based here any job
loss can be minimized.

Best of luch to you, your family, and your Enron family !

Yours in Christ,
