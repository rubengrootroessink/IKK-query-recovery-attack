MESSAGE FROM LOD FOR  KEN:
Thank you for your  responses to my email and I look forward to hearing what your Community  Relations department recommends on the Bush Library  endowment.
 
I would also like to  confirm a meeting in New York with our CEO, Tom Casey, on Wed, Sept 5 - perhaps  at 4pm?  Please let us know where would be convenient for you - if it  works, we have offices downtown on Pine Street and Mr. Casey has an  apartment at Essex House on Central Park South.
 
Thanks
Sheila for Lod  Cook
