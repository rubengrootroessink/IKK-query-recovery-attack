Ken

I received a copy of the agenda for your October 3 & 4 conference on
Alternative Futures for the Current Energy Crisis.  I applaude you for your
continued leadership in the public policy arena for energy.

The absence of representatives from the coal industry is obvious.  Since
coal is America's largest domestic energy resource and it fuels 52% of
America's electricity, it should be represented.

Thank you for your consideration and best wishes.

Irl
