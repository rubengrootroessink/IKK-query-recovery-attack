I just wanted to let you know that if there is anything I can do to help I am more than willing to do it.  These are difficult times and I am doing alot of floor meetings and table talks with the employees.  They clearly do not understand how we got into this situation and just want some face time with Management.  With the exception of NEPCO our fourth quarter looks good.  I have uncovered alot of issues with NEPCO that I do not think anyone knew existed.  I'll know more Friday after a businnes/budget review session.

Please let me know if I can help.

Stan
