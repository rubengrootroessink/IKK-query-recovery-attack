From CNN's Crossfire Staff:

Tonight in the CROSSFIRE... the U.S. Justice Department
is putting top priority on tracking down 6,000
"deportable aliens" of Middle Eastern and Arab descent.
Is it racial profiling to target one ethnic group for
ejection? Shouldn't all aliens who have overstayed their
visas or violated rules be treated equally? Could this
measure help prevent future terrorist attacks, or is it
a violation of individual rights? After Sept. 11th and
given the common characteristics of the hijackers, is
it justified to apply added scrutiny to those who fit
the same profile? Former Deputy Attorney General George
Terwilliger argues that profiling may be necessary in
the war on terrorism while Wade Henderson of the
Leadership Council on Civil Rights says individuals
of certain backgrounds shouldn't be singled out by
law enforcement. It should make for a heated debate.

Join Bill Press and Robert Novak tonight on Crossfire,
7:30pm eastern, 4:30 pacific. On CNN.
