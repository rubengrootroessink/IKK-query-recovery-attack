ARTICLES AND PAPERS

"MPLS Branches Out - It's more than a non-ATM way to engineer the
core."
September 2001 - Telecommunications Magazine
Excellent article by Sam Masud, Senior Technology Editor
http://www.integralaccess.com/press_news57.htm

New White Paper Available ...
"MGCP Implementation in the Access Gateway"
Is it better to implement MGCP in a line access gateway at the
customer premise (e.g. in an Integrated Access Device) or in a line
access gateway at an Access Aggregation point (e.g. an edge router)?
While there are claims of advantages and disadvantages for each
alternative, invariably, a combination of technical and economic
factors associated with each alternative will prove the final market
positioning.

including copper pairs, xDSL, leased lines, and Fiber links.  It is
the first and only 100 percent packet-based access network solution

aggregation devices for central offices, co-locations, points of
presence, PurePacketCompact for multi-tenant units (MTU), and the
