To my dearest precious husband,

Please reread every word of this and do it because you love me.

"Be of good courage, and He shall strengthen your heart, all you who hope in
the Lord."  - Psalm 31:24

Courage belongs to those who know God, says the psalmist.  And, I say we all
need to continually affirm God's power to protect us.  Today I have created
a litany which affirms our faith in God's power, so that we need never be
afraid.  Since our current situation strikes fear in our hearts, read this
litany of courage and praise.  You need never be afraid!

	When I am being tested beyond measure in my job responsibilities ...
		I will put my trust in God.
	When I am facing the greatest hurdles of my life...
		The Lord gives me courage!
	When I feel like I am completely alone...
		The Lord is my light and salvation!
	When I feel like the bottom is falling out...
		My heart shall know no fear!  God will save me!
	When I have no other answers or solutions...
		God will send the help I need!
	When I go through every terrifying minute of the day...
		I am expecting the Lord to rescue me!
	When I think failure is upon me...
		I am brave, for God's power is greater than any situation I could possibly
face today.


"FEAR NOT, FOR I HAVE REDEEMED YOU; I HAVE CALLED YOU BY YOUR NAME, KEN AND
BEAU, YOU ARE MINE.  WHEN YOU GO THROUGH THE WATERS AND GREAT TROUBLE I WILL
BE WITH YOU.  WHEN YOU GO THROUGH RIVERS, THEY SHALL NOT OVERFLOW YOU.  WHEN
YOU WALK THROUGH THE FIRE YOU SHALL NOT BE BURNED, NOR THE FLAME SCORCH YOU.
FOR I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD, YOUR SAVIOR...YOU ARE PRECIOUS IN MY SIGHT, YOU
HAVE BEEN HONORED, AND I HAVE LOVED YOU.  FEAR NOT, FOR I AM WITH YOU."
Isaiah 43:1-5

The bottom line of our life should be faith, not fear, so live today
controlled by God-inspired positive thoughts!!!

Love and prayers,
Your Hon
