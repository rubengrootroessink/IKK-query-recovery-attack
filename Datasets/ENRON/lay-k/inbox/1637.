Dear Dr. Lay,

President Putin is coming to Rice on November 14th.  He will speak at Stude
Hall (in the music school) from 12:00-12:40pm and has asked to meet a few
select energy company executives at a private reception held in a nearby
room from 12:40-1:00pm.  Although not confirmed, it is anticipated that 41
will also be there and, of course, Mr. Baker and Ambassador Djerejian.
President Putin is making this special stop between his meetings in
Washington with 43 and his visit to the ranch in Crawford. Please let us
know if you would like to attend and I will see that you receive a formal
invitation.  I can be contacted at 713-348-2374 or by e-mail at
jelyons@alumni.rice.edu.

Best Regards,
Jason Lyons
