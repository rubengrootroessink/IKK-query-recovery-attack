Dr. Lay -

The decision to go with Planners Services Group versus Extraordinary Events, TBA Inc., or Ward & Ames was made by the ONE ENRON Holiday Party Planning Committee.  (Planners has an established relationship with Enron Field and coordinated ECT's Holiday party there last year.) Each vendor gave creative presentations and were very similar in capabilities.  While Ward & Ames provided sound ideas in their proposal, there were a few aspects that affected the final decision.  Ward and Ames' proposal was over budget when calibrated against other bids, holds an internal perception of being "controlling" vs flexible (i.e. logo launch & Portland adopted elephant event) and presentation was satisfactory but not outstanding when compared to others. Overall each of the vendors would have been capable of handling the event, but in the end Planners was unanimously selected by the Planning Committee.
