Ken - As you know, we had several issues that needed to get tied down before the BoD reconvenes to review Project Southwood.   Both Jeff McMahon (deal timing) and Rick Causey (goodwill) are ready.  Andy Fastow expects to have a read from the agencies very soon (likely late today).  As soon as I hear from Andy, I will begin polling and will set the date, hopefully, for early next week.  At this time, I am not aware of any additional items that need to be addressed by the Board in the upcoming meeting.  We need to confirm the 2002 BoD calendar but can do that in the regularly scheduled meeting in Dec.  Thanks, Paula
