Ken,  
I realize these are tough days for you.  I want you to know that I am glad you are there and that you are the key to getting things back on track.  I am certain that you have seen tough times before (unlike much of your management) and that you will LEAD Enron through this period. 
From a bystander position (I left Enron in May), I encourage you to clearly bring all the issues to light immediately, take the lumps, and demonstrate to the community and the employees that necessary corrections will be made and made competently and forcibly.   
Times like these define leaders and I know you have the courage and experience to hang in there.  If there is anything I can do to assist, let me know.   
Jim Noles
