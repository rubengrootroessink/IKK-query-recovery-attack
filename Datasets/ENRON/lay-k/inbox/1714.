Ken - 
 
As a follow-up, we realize there has been  tremendous downward pressure on the stock recently and as a result selling new  equity at these levels could be very dilutive.  We can structure an equity  financing that is a premium to today's prices.  I would welcome the chance  to discuss this with you.
 
regards,
Dan  Myers
