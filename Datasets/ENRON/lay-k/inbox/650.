Thank you for indicating your preferences for personal follow-up calls
to The Center's funds solicitation letter.

Unfortunately, Ben Love's health precludes him from making any follow-up
calls on this campaign.  Could I ask each of you very busy gentlemen to
commit to call 11 folks as follow-up to The Center's funds solicitation
letter?  I will compile the list and adjust any duplications and forward
it again to each of you.

Please indicate your preferences on this form and return it to me by
e-mail or by fax (or please feel free to call).  Thank you for your
commitment.
