Ken, you know how much I care about this company and all that you stand for with it.  This situation is beyond the ability of one person at the top to fix.  I suggest that you look outside the company and find a person with unqestioned experience, intelligence and integrity -- someone with close ties to the financial community -- to join you in the Chairman's office and turn things around.  This person can look the analysits squarely in the eye and tell them to back off while we get back on track.  At this point,  I don't feel that you can only rely on your people here within the company.  And I also don't see how you can take this burden wholly on your shoulders.  Bring in the help you need, at the highest levels!  Thanks for listening.  elizabeth
