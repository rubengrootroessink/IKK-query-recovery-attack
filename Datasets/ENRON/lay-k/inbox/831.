Dr. Lay-

I know that you are very busy right now, but I wanted to thank you for your efforts.  I just talked to a friend of mine.  I had said that I had not seen you anywhere over the last six weeks or so, he said that he had seen you at church.  As an employee, it comforts me to know this.

I know that you are working very hard on a myriad of projects right now.  I can only imagine the stress and strain that you are under, but I also wanted to warn you that I think the upper management is losing the faith of the employees.  This division could be cancerous to our new company as we attempt to rebuild Enron.  For that reason, I have been trying to come up with some concrete things that could mend this rift.  I am fearful that as a company our focus is very external, when many of the employees have faced amazing losses and personal uncertainty.  For that reason, I have put together a couple of pages of ideas that might be helpful.  This is not meant to be disrespectful, I simply want to put some of my ideas out there.  I am trying to help, and I feel frustrated.

I would appreciate it if you would read these two pages personally, not because you owe me something, but because you may be the only person who actually matters in this company right now.  

I have worked for Enron for a little over two years, and I still work for Enron.  I would like to continue working for Enron, but it is really hard to feel any level of confidence in these uncertain time.  Some of this is related to business uncertainty, but a huge percentage of this is because I feel like as a company we are slowly folding-up shop.  Employees are bitter.  Managers do not have clear direction.  Nobody is certain what is happening.   Basically, I just want to do my part to help.

Thank you for your time.
