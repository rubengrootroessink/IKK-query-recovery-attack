FYI, here are the questions the WSJ reporter sent to John Mendelsohn.  I forwarded them to Andy earlier today.  No word yet today on timing.

Here are the questions from John Emshwiller.  (He's based in LA so he will still
be in the office.)

Per your request, here are some of the questions I would like to ask Dr.
Mendelsohn about in connection with his role as an Enron board member.
     1.  Does he recall any questions coming before the board regarding
the LJM2 Co-Investment, LP and the involvement of certain Enron officials in
that partnership?  If so, what matters pertaining to the partnership were
considered by the board?
     2.  Did Dr. Mendelsohn have any concerns regarding the involvement
of Enron officials in that partnership?
     3.  Is he aware of anyone else within the board or the company
having any concerns about the LJM2 partnership?
     4.  Is Dr. Mendelsohn familiar with recent changes in the management
of the partnership?  If so, does he know what prompted those changes?
     5.  Is Dr. Mendelsohn familiar with the compensation level paid to
the general partner of the LJM2 partnership?

     regards,
     John Emshwiller
     Senior National Correspondent
