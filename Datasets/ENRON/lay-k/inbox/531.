Dear Ken,
I apologize for bothering you with this kind of a nuisance, however I hope  you can help my friend. I called you a year ago about  problems dealing with the Houston Pipeline group. I am appealing to you again.  
 
I was contacted to provide nitrogen gas for a  pipeline pigging project last year on a 20" line that goes south from Corpus  Christi. Rusty Bellflower told me I was  going to provide the nitrogen and then after my group was mobilized on short  notice over a weekend, they cancelled - did not even call us, just never called  back. I spent a week on the project and my subcontractor was out his  mobilization cost, and after more than a year, they finally paid a part of our  cost.
 
During the negotiation for the nitrogen set up, I  visited the pipeline site, and saw some oil on the ground. I mentioned to the  HPL rep Rusty Bellflower, that I had a biological product that is excellent for  eliminating oil. He called in a big rush on a Friday afternoon and said for me  to hot shot 10 or so drums of the stuff to a site on the beach (10 pigs or  something) where they would put the chemical into the 20" pipeline. He even gave  me a PO number (X000496) A week later he called and said they decided not to use  the chemical. I told him we were going to charge for restocking and the cost for  hot shot services. 
 
Rusty said that if we charged them anything we  could be sure that we would never work for HPL or Enron again.
 
That is my experience with HPL. 
 
Now my friend Jay Pope with Coastline Resources is  also having trouble on his part of the pipeline work. Nick Cocavessis of HPL  contacted Jay and asked Jay to bid the pigging job. A few things went wrong, but  most of them were a result of bad decisions on the part of the HPL personnel.  Why did they call a small outfit like Coastline in the first place? It looks  like they called them so they could muscle them around at the end of the job.  Jay Pope has been able to reduce the balance due to the subcontractors to  $2,780,000.  Enron is offering $2,550,000. Enron attorney (Andy  Edison) said "Tell Jay he'll just have to chiselanother $ 230,000.00 out  of the sub's"
 
I am a stockholder in Enron, but I do not see the  sense in beating up contractors. Is there anything you can do to get the old HPL  group to settle with Jay?
 
Thank you for looking at this.
