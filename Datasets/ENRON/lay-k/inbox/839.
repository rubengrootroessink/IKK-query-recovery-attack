They are both on the case here.

I have asked both Ben Smith and Dan Leff to confirm
that these expenses will be paid so I can close the
office in Nevada.  It is a small amount but I can not
cover the cost for Enron out of my personal funds.
The total outstanding is $3,443.04.  Can you please
see that this gets paid ASAP.
Thanks and God Bless,
Chuck Allured

Ben, Leticia,
I hope this is not the last time we get to work
together.  As we discussed, I will have some office
closure expenses that I will need to get reimbursed
for.  I have been locked out of the server so I can
not enter them into the xms system.
This amounts to the following:

ATT wireless:
$212.71 November Billing
$90 Termination charge

Nevada Bell:
$170 November billing (est.)
$500 DSL Setup fee (November)
$49.95 November DSL monthly fee
$250 Termination Charge of one year contract

--------
$1,272.66 Total

Can you please process this and get $ to me asap so I
can disconnect all of the services?  You can reach me
at (775)832-2141 or cra123@yahoo.com

Thanks for all of the memories and may God bless us
all.
Chuck
