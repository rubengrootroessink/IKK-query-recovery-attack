I am serving as a Board Member for the Houston Children's Chorus.  The Chorus is presenting a Children's Commemorative Concert on Sunday October 14 th at Grace Presbyterian Church and has requested corporate underwriting in the amount of $ 5,000 for the event.  Proceeds from a free-will offering will be given to the Red Cross education fund of the children whose parents died in the September 11 New York tragedy.

Mr. Steve Roddy has sent correspondence to your office in this regard, and I hope that you will give his request serious consideration.

Thank you,
Arthur Goldsmith
