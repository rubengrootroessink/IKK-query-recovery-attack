On July 6th, I'll celebrate my 42nd birthday with a luncheon in Austin at Shoreline Grill.  It's become an annual event, and I hope you'll be able to join me for this one.  I'll be touching base with you soon but would be honored if you would consider serving on my Host Committee (of course, I'd love to have you as an Event Underwriter!!) for this year's event. 
A strong officeholder account will help me stay active as I travel across the state advocating for the issues that are important to 
you and me.  That's why I hope you'll take a moment now and consider being a part of the upcoming celebration. 
I've included a response sheet as an attachment to this email.  Please fax or email your response to Jennifer Waisath at 
"Friends of Tony Garza" at (512) 474-0825 or at jennifer@tonygarza.com.  In order to ensure that your name is listed on the 
invitation, we need to hear from you no later than Tuesday, June 12th. 
I've never forgotten that it's your consistent support that's allowed me the opportunity to serve our great state, and I know that I'm fortunate to have you as a friend and supporter.  I look forward to seeing you on July 6th. 
Regards, 
Tony
