Ken,  I know there is not much anyone can say to you to help you through
what must be the most difficult situation that you or anyone else could
imagine . I just wanted you to know that I think you are being treated very
unfairly by the media. We all know that the media only gets half the story
right and that the half they get right is not often reported. I appreciate
all that you and Enron have done for our city. I believe that over time when
all the pundits are done with the Enron story and the reality of your
contribution to the quality of life in Houston is fully understood there
will be a better story to tell. In the meantime if there is anything I can
do for you please let me know. Take care. Ric
