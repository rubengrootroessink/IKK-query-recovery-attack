Thursday, June 14, 2001, 10:00-11:30 a.m.
Wohlstetter Conference Center, Twelfth Floor, AEI

In response to the recent electricity price increases in California, Gov. Gray Davis has called on the federal government to cap electricity prices in the western United States. However, price caps have traditionally led to shortages and other negative economic consequences. At this seminar, leading economists will discuss the causes of the crisis and will debate policies that have been proposed to combat the soaring energy costs and frequent power outages associated with the crisis.
