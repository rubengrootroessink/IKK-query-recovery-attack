Mr. Lay, 
I am a former employee of Enron and have been through many trials in the past few years. God has been faithful and seen me through them all. Dear sir, I can tell you that I can count it all joy. I just want to encourage you. These look like very dark times right now. Call upon the name of the Lord. Throw yourself on the mercy and grace of the Lord and remember all that he has done. He is a BIG, GOOD God that LOVES you! His arm hasn't been shortened that He cannot help you. 
You will be glad to know that the true testimony of you as a man is of a good report. You will glorify God in this. I am listening to a song right this minute that I so wish you could hear. It would bring you such comfort. It is based on the verse that talks about "all of my help cometh from the Lord". How true that is for you. 
Lord Jesus, you are a good God that sees all things. Mr. Lay is a man of God. That means he is your child. You tell us that you are an ever present help in time of trouble. These troubles are over his head but under your feet. Lord Jesus, show yourself strong on his behalf. Glorify yourself and Mr. Lay will give you the glory. He knows, Lord. Help him in this time when the waters are flowing over his head. Hear him from where you are. We are all but dust. Who are we that you are mindful of us but you tell us in your Word that You have good thoughts and plans for us and they are for good and NOT EVIL that we may have an expected end. (Jer 29:11-For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.) Who can stand except you give us grace? Lord, you are so good. Remind Mr. Lay of who you really are. In the mighty name of Jesus!

Mr. Lay, get some scripture to hang onto-write it down on a card and carry it with you. When things come against you (the enemy), you will need to remember who you are in Jesus! The greatest battle on earth was fought with the Word of God (Satan against Jesus in the wilderness)!
Isaiah 54:17-No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their righteousness is of me, saith the LORD.
Oh Mr. Lay, one more thing. I am telling you that I haven't a clue as to what has or has not been done. I just want to show you something from the Word of God how God is. If you will read Isaiah's calling in Isaiah 6 and read Moses' calling in Exodus 3, you will see that God DOES NOT mention their sin to them. Isaiah was just overcome with the glory of God and confessed all by himself and Moses (remember he had killed an Egyptian) was just trying to convince God that He had to be wrong. The ONLY reason I mention it is because sometimes we delay in going to God because we think we have done something wrong. God tells us that He hasn't dealt with us according to our sins. KNOW that NO MATTER WHAT, Jesus is ready to fight on your behalf! It is ALWAYS about God's SPIRIT and not our strength. 
When I started this email, you were just a stranger. You are now my beloved brother in Christ. Isn't it amazing how God works. He has knit my heart to yours. I will be on my knees for you. Phillipians tells us to pray for E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G! What does everything mean? EVERYTHING! God's gonna do some amazing stuff so get ready!!!! His ways aren't our ways and remember too-He is able to do EXCEEDINGLY ABOVE what we can ask or think!

The Joy of the Lord is my strength...
