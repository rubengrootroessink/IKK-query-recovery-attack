The tears rolled down my face the night Channel 11 broke through with the a=
nnouncement that Enron was going to merge with Dynegy. My heart was breakin=
g, seeing the hurt in Ken Lay's eyes and to see our company tumbling down a=
s if it was the New York Trade Center this was my first thought and questio=
n how could a few cruel and selfish individuals bring something so wonderfu=
l down after so many years of hard work? The E means something to me. I'm s=
o proud to be apart of this great company that you and Enron employees buil=
t. There are so many roomers of blame, but I can't for a second believe you=
 had anything to do with this I know your a man of your word and speak from=
 your heart and I'm so sorry you couldn't enjoy your retirement and had to =
come back to this mess. I just wanted you to know that I'm behind your deci=
sions and have the utmost respect for you also. Hopefully some day the indi=
viduals that put this great company down will be held accountable and be ma=
de put the money they stole back to the company. Take care of yourself and =
your health we need you.
Sincerely, Velvet
