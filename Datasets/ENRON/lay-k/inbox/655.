Mr. Lay, 

For the past 13 days, I have been on a medical mission trip to Honduras (five of which weren't
scheduled, but were necessary because Continental canceled flights in light of our nation's
tragedy).

Although Honduras is a third world country and very little American news makes it there, I was
told that Enron had donated 1 million dollars to the Red Cross and was matching employee donations 
2 to 1 in response to the terrorist attacks on our Country. Mr. Lay, it made me even more proud 
to work for this company, and to work for you.

I can't tell you what an honor it is to work for this company and for you (you hear countless stories
of what you and Enron have done for our community).

Sincerely,

Josh Duncan
