Here is the update for the Architectural electronic bill.  Mrs Lay and I have discussed it and she has authorised payment.  I feel confident that the billing is correct although very delayed.  I have attached a spread sheet for quick reference for all work to date on the Huntingdon.  I am happy to supply any specific information you may need.
