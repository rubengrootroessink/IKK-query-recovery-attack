Dear Mr. Lay
=09Through all of the trials and negativity that is occurring I would like =
to send these words of encouragement from my family and I.  I have been wit=
h this company 21 years.  We have had many wonderful and exciting years wit=
h Enron.  When I first met my wife six years ago she was 90% in both ears. =
 Through the blessing of our insurance plan she now today has 98% hearing c=
apacity in both ears.  The many years of working for Enron has provided me =
with a steady job and a good income, while allowing me to work on my Ph.D. =
 The many friendships and relationships I have been blessed with through wo=
rking for this company will be treasured for the rest of my life.  Yes, I a=
m one of the employees who have lost their retirement, but through all of t=
his my wife and I would like to send our vote of confidence to you and the =
board to be able to find ways to make the impossible happen.  This company =
was built to be one of the worlds largest companies through your efforts ov=
er the past several years.  Yes, there has been experiments in going beyond=
 normal paradigms and there has been mistakes made.  But through the mistak=
es is where the true gift of learning and stability comes.
=09The ultimate challenge in life is not how much money one can make or tha=
t first ultimate achievement.  The ultimate challenge in life is "CAN I DO =
IT AGAIN?" We believe, that Enron can learn from what is happening and even=
tually become bigger, better, and stronger than it has ever been.  And we b=
elieve that you, Ken Lay, CAN DO IT AGAIN, bigger and better than it was do=
ne before. =20
=09I remember once reading about Donald Trump going into bankruptcy.  He su=
mmoned before him the best advisors in the world to pull the most educated =
and smartest financial people together to find a solution, and he moved on =
to build bigger and better investments.  "HE DID IT AGAIN."
=09The true answers to the impossible come from the heart during our quiet =
moments with ourselves, in these moments I know you will find the answers. =
 My family and I have chosen to start the turn around of the negativity int=
o a positive direction by believing that you and our board can make the imp=
ossible happen.  We have freely chosen to take the last $10,000 we have in =
our 401k and invest it into Enron Stock as a show of faith to ourselves tha=
t we believe the impossible can happen.  If anyone does not have the faith =
in themselves to make this happen please let our faith in you be yours for =
now.  Enron has always tried to go beyond the normal paradigms and can take=
 advantage of this tremendous opportunity to create the impossible and do s=
omething that has never been done before. "WE CAN DO IT AGAIN!"
=09My family and I send all of you our love, faith and belief in yourself t=
o do the impossible
