Good Morning!

I am a Sr. Buyer for ETS.  I've been with the Company for over 19 years and I just want to tell you that as a long-time employee, I have nothing but the highest admiration and respect for you and the way you tackle the challenges of running this vast corporation.  Sure my financial investment in this company has suffered along with everyone else's but I'm not worried.  Enron is a solid company and you are most capable.  Some of the questions yesterday really irked me because everyone has no problem riding the "high" times but do nothing but grumble at the first sign of trouble.  You made this company great and I've no doubt that you can do it again.  I'm not management level and have very, very little impact on the bottom line, but I love this company and  I intend to do the best work that I can do for Enron and I am happy to be here through thick AND thin.

I know that you have the Company's and employees best interest in your heart.  Be encouraged and know that the majority of us think that you're SUPER !!

Rinetia Turner
