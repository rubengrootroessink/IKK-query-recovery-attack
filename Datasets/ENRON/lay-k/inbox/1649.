Ken:

Rather than remain silently on the sidelines as the press and the financial
community fan the flames, I wanted to offer up whatever personal or
professional help I can provide to you.  I've always known you as a straight
shooter and a man of high personal integrity.  I have no doubt that that
integrity transcends the entire organization that you have created.

Best Regards in these trying times,


David
