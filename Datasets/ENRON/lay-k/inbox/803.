Mr. Lay:

I do not know who is left in EES or Corporate HR to send this to.

I was severed Oct 5 and have two severance payments due on 31 Dec and 31 Jan.
 Will Enron pay these?  Since I signed a waiver not to sue Enron, can I
participate in the bankruptcy proceedings if Enron does not pay?  Also, there
are  quite a few previously severed employees who have questions, would you
add information to the website regarding our status regarding payments etc.

Regards,
