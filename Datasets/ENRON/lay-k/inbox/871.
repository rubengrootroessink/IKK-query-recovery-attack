Due to the Bankruptcy Filing on December 2, 2001, a decision was made to discontinue the flexperq allowance.  This decision was made after the December 14 payroll run.  You will receive your allowance of $1,218.75 on your December 14 paycheck; however,  Payroll will reduce your 12/31 paycheck for the same amount.

Also, please note that executive physicals will no longer be offered or related expenses covered by Enron.

Thank you!
