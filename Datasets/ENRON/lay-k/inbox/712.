Dear Ken:

I just wanted to let you know that despite all that has happened in the last
few days,I am confident that under your leadership we will come back even
stronger!
The Enron you have built over the past  years still remains the best place
to work today, as it did when I first came on-board as an Associate in the
Research Group.
God Bless!

Regards,
Pravas Sud
