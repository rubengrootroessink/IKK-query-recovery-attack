Mr. Lay:

In view of the events of past weeks surrounding Enron's stock, I am taking =
the liberty of writing this note to you. I will try to keep this brief. Fir=
st of all, I want to say that  you are doing a terrific job. With your lead=
ership we will turn this around soon. May God bless you and your family so =
you can continue leading this great company out of this crisis. I have been=
 with the company for almost 21 years. I remember the difficult days that w=
e have been through during this time . Particularly I remember like yesterd=
ay when I used to be in Omaha and you came there and, talked to all of us a=
nd gave us hope and your commitment to turn things around in those uncertai=
n and difficult days after the merger and promised to make this a great com=
pany. We all rallied behind you and we turned this company into one of the =
greatest company in the world. We are with you now, and with your leadershi=
p we will turn this around again. For most of us, Enron is not just a place=
 to work. It is part of us.  It is our family. It is our life. In the curre=
nt situation the pain we feel is the same as if one of our loved one was se=
riously sick and we did not know what to do except to follow the advise of =
the doctor. We will follow your advise and give you our 200% . On a persona=
l level for me this a very emotional and painful time. I have grown with th=
is company that has given me great opportunities.  Currently I am working i=
n Bolivia as president of Gas TransBoliviano and feel perhaps there is some=
thing I should be doing to help in this situation. Mr. Lay, If there is any=
thing I can do above and beyond my current job, please let me know. You hav=
e my commitment and I will not disappoint you. Please consider me like one =
of those guys in NY showing up with shovels to help after the WTC disaster.=
 I am hoping that I will be called upon. Again, may God bless you and your =
family. Look forward to seeing you in San Antonio.

With Kind Regards,

Nasim Khan
