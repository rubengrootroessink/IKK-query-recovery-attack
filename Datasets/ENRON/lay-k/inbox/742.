I genuinely believed in Enron and the Values of the company

You demonstrated that that trust was misplaced and worth nothing

I particularly like your adherance to the core values - you "respected" us,
you "communicated" brilliantly with us, your fucking us over was
"excellent", your "integrity" was without question

You load of bastards - you screwed us all and got fat on the profits of our
sweat

I hope that the board and upper management rot in jail and never see the
light of day again - apart from when you are exercising in the open prison
yard in your shackles

Just Another Fucked Over Ex-Employee
