You and I both attended the World Economic Forum in Davos.

The Damocles sword of terrorism is STILL hanging over the world. I am contacting you now concerning an approach to PREVENT terrorism which I feel merits your scrutiny.

This highly effective, new technology of defense has been put forward by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the founder of the worldwide Transcendental Meditation program. If, after reading the following message, this unique, peaceful approach interests you, I can set up a private conversation for you with eminent scientists who support it.

I feel even a short conversation will be interesting and a valuable use of your time. These scientists include Dr. John Hagelin, a world-renowned quantum physicist and presidential candidate of the Natural Law Party in 2000, who has been meeting with members of the US Congress and business leaders worldwide. The response has been very positive and enthusiastic.  (Please visit http://www.hagelin.org to learn more about Dr. Hagelin and his success.)

As a businessman, I am always seeking practical solutions to problems. I have experienced this peaceful solution first-hand, and it really works. It diffuses acute social stress, including the deep-seated ethnic, political, and religious tensions that fuel terrorism and conflict. Maharishi's technology of defense has been field-tested repeatedly over the past 20 years. Nineteen scientific studies, verified with over 50 replications and published in independent peer-reviewed journals, validate its effectiveness. (See http://www.PermanentPeace.org )

Clearly, nothing else has proven effective in PREVENTING terrorist attacks before they begin.

I feel the most important lesson from Davos is the interconnectedness of the world's economic, social, and political relationships -- a lesson which, tragically, terrorism has concretely hammered home. It is from the deepest, quantum mechanical level of life, where interconnectedness is most profound, that Maharishi's programs work.

I urge you to take a few minutes to visit the web site http://www.PermanentPeace.org , where you can see the profound scientific foundation for Maharishi's technology of defense.

Please kindly respond with the times when you would be available, if you are interested in a conversation with Dr. Hagelin concerning this proven approach to prevent terrorism and create a foundation for world peace.
