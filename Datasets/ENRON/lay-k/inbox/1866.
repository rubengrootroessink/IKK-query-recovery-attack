As we begin to work on our board/senior management retreat for 2003, we would like to test your interest in the possibility of holding the meeting in Shanghai during the week of June 15, 2003.  The tentative schedule would be to travel on Monday, June 16, arriving in Shanghai on Tuesday.  Meetings would take place  Wednesday through Saturday, with departures on Sunday.  Please let me know if such a schedule would be feasible for you, keeping in mind that at this point we're simply trying to determine if you would be able to devote this week to the trip.
