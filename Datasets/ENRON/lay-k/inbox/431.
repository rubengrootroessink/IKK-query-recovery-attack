Mom & Ken,
 
The Astros playoff tickets were much appreciated.  I had a great time  even though the outcome of the two games was not as we would have liked.   Heather & I took her Dad and Josh (two baseball die-hards) to one of the  games and I took some friends to the other.  Everyone was thrilled to be  able to go and extremely thankful for the tickets.  Thanks again for your  generousity and more importantly, not objecting to me being out of the  office for a few hours to attend the game.
 
Love,
Beau
