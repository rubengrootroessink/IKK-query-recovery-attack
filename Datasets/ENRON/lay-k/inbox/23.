Dear Mr Lay,

Up Magazine, the leading magazine for British entrepreneurs,
(www.up-mag.com <http://www.up-mag.com>) would like to request an
interview with yourself for the September edition. Recent issues have
featured exclusive interviews with Scott McNealy, CEO of Sun
Microsystems, Kevin Ryan, CEO of DoubleClick, and Carly Fiorina, CEO of
Hewlett Packard.

As the magazine's 35,000 readership comprises ambitious business people
and budding entrepreneurs an in-depth feature on the lessons of
entrepreneurship from the oil industry would be of immense value.

Writer: The feature will be written by myself or my deputy, Adrian
Murdoch, formerly deputy editor of World Link, the magazine of the World
Economic Forum.

Photography. We would like to take our own original shots of yourself
and can travel wherever required.

Timeframe: We would require to speak to you before the end of July. If
your schedule does not permit a face-to-face interview then telephone
would be fine. We have also conducted several excellent e-mail
interviews in the recent past.

Thank you for your time. Should you have any questions do not hesitate
to give me call. I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours sincerely

John Hatfield
Editor
