Dear Mr C.Robberts

During the shortlisting for Contract CD 94-95 your  company, Enron International, was one of those shortlisted for the contract.  Later the component of transformers was removed and packaged separately as TD  98. We are about to send out Invitations to Tender for TD 98 to all the  previously shortlisted companies.
As a matter of urgency, please confirm to us the  contact Email address, Telephone, Fax, Postal and physical addresses. Reply to  both  Emails shown below.
