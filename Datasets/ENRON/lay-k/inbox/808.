Hi Ken, This is just a note to let you know that I am very proud of my
famous brother. You have accomplished so much and you are still a
relatively young man. (At least in spirit). Please take care of yourself
during the challenging time. Get your checkups and take your vitamins.
As I said during Thanksgiving, you have excellent genes but I am sure
you're being required to stretch even your limits right now.

We are just fine.  We enjoyed seeing you and being with the family so
much over Thanksgiving.  I am certainly glad you ordered such good
weather. We seemed to have brought it back here this week as we are
really having spring weather. I have just returned from my run to the
University gym where I worked out on the weight machines, talked to a
few friends, and ran home. My knees are a little creaky, but they still
work. John is supervising a new septic tank at the farm this week and
will return to Columbia tomorrow. I will facilitate a planning retreat
at the University next week so I must spend some of my time working on
that and also managing rental property.

I think it is good for us to get together when we can. When you get out
of this crisis, give us a call and maybe we can come to Houston for a
weekend, (Probably after the first of the year). In the meantime, our
thoughts and prayers are with you. Always love, Sister Bonnie
