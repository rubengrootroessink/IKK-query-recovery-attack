Mr. Lay, I guess I just wanted to let you know that I appreciate the fact that you are at least hanging around trying to do something about the terrible mess Enron is in, and communicating with us once in awhile.  It's been awful for us as employees but I can't imagine what you've been going through every day.  Anyway, thanks and take care of yourself.

Sincerely,

An ETS employee
