I previously worked for Enron and have found employment elsewhere.  I really would like to put my son back into Enron Kids starting Monday, but I cannot afford $800 a month.  Do you know if the rates will be lowered?  I am a single mother and can only afford $650 - $680 a month.  Could you please get back with me as soon as possible?  I need to know if I am going to have to put him in another daycare.  
Thank you for your consideration.
