Dad,
The message boards look really good today. There are
one or two bad guys, but they are the shorts and
everyone else is betting on stock back in the 20's
before the weekend and a turnaround. The general
consensus is Enron is still a good company with good
earnings and this is a great time to buy.
Love You Dad,
ME
