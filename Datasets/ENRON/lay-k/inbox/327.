Thank you for the opportunity to meet this morning.  I spoke bluntly.  Please know that it is because of my confidence in you and the rest of our management team that I felt inspired to do so.  If we can have frank discussions in times like these, we will emerge even stronger.  Thank you for standing up there and taking the heat.
