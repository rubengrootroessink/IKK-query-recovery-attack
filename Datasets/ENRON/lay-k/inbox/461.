Dear Jessica,

Monday, October 8th is Sharon Lay's birthday.  Please call her assistant to
find out where she will be on Monday (in the office or wherever).  Then, if
you are told that she will be somewhere here in the Houston, please call
Patrick @Empty Vase and have him deliver a very special birthday arrangement
(lots of bright colored tulips, w/hydrangeas, etc.) to wherever she happens
to be.  If she is traveling in the country, however somewhere out of state,
have Patrick wire them.  If she is out of the country, advise me.

Please have the following message attached:

	"Dear Sharon,

	Along with these flowers, we send hugs, kisses and our very best wishes to
you for a wonderful birthday.  Lots of Love too, Linda and Ken"


Thanks, Linda
