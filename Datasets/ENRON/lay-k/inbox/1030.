Dear Ken and Linda,
I just want you to know William and I have been praying for you.  I know yo=
ur hearts so I don't look at the circumstances and neither does God.  It do=
esn't depend on the circumstances, the strength of your arm or your voice. =
 I hope you find this encouraging and uplifting. =20
I wanted to share some verses with you both and some things that Oswald Cha=
mbers says in his book His Utmost for His Highest.  "My eager desire and ho=
pe being that I may never feel ashamed, but that now as ever I may do honou=
r to Christ in my own person by fearless courage." Phil. 1:20 =20
"We shall all feel ashamed if we do not yield to Jesus on the point He aske=
d us to yield to Him.  To get there is a question of will, not of debate no=
r of reasoning, but a surrender of will, an absolute and irrevocable surren=
der on that point.  An over-weaning consideration for ourselves is the thin=
g that keeps us from that decison, though we put it that we are considering=
 others.  When we consider what it will cost others if we obey the call of =
Jesus, we tell God He does not know what our obedience will mean.  Keep to =
the point;  He does know.  Shut out every other consideration and keep your=
self before God for this one thing only- My Utmost for His Highest.  I am d=
etermined to be absolutely and entirely for Him and for Him alone. Whether =
that means life or death, no matter.  Paul is determined that nothing shall=
 deter him from doing exactly what God wants.  God's order has to work up t=
o a crisis in our lives because we will not ! heed the gentler way.   He br=
ings us to the place where He askes us to be our utmost for Him, and we beg=
in to debate; then He produces a providential crisis where we have to decid=
e- for or against, and from that point the "Great Divide" begins.  If the c=
risis has come to you on any line, surrender your will to Him absolutely an=
d irrevocably.  What do you expect to do?  You do not know what you are goi=
ng to do; the only thing you know is that God knows what He is doing.  Trus=
t Him entirely.  You may not know what He will do next, but you have to tru=
st He does.  We need to come in close contact with the teachings of Jesus C=
hrist.  If we have never had the experience of taking our commonplace relig=
ious shoes off our commonplace religious feet, and getting rid of all the u=
ndue familiarity with which we approach God it is questionable whether we h=
ave ever stood in His presence."
God bless you during this time.  We will continue to pray for God's will in=
 your lives.
Sincerely,
Barbara T. Collins.
