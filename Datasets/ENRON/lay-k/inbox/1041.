Dear Mr. Kenneth L. Lay

As the Editor-in-Chief of TheMarker and a senior columnist for Ha'aretz
newspaper in Israel, I want to check the possibility of conducting an
interview with you on the occasion of the World Economic Forum in New
York this month.

I'm going to be in New York covering the WEF from January 31st' to
February 1st' and I would be obliged if you will be able to give us a
short interview during the days of the convention.

Let me add some information about myself and our publications:

I am the Editor-in-Chief of TheMarker and a senior financial columnist
of the Ha'aretz daily newspaper in Israel.

Since 1994 I write a daily column in Ha'aretz about financial markets,
economic policy, technology and matters of corporate strategy. The
column is regarded as one of the most influential column in the Israeli
press.

I am also the Editor-in-Chief and the found of TheMarker - a Ha'aretz
subsidiary that publishes Israel's most popular financial online news
service and Israel's monthly business Magazine.

Ha'aretz is Israel's most reliable source of local and international
daily news and commentary. Ha'aretz addresses the country's decision
makers in matters of policy, culture and business. Ha'aretz is also the
oldest daily newspaper in Israel, established in 1919.  Ha'aretz
publishes an English version with the International Herald Tribune.

TheMarker is the Ha'aretz subsidiary that focuses on business and
financial news and commentary. TheMarker publishes Israel's first and
most and influential financial online service and Israel's monthly print
business magazine. TheMarker online news service is also published in
English  (www.themarker.com/eng).

I have 14 years of experience in Journalism. I was the Business editor
of Ha'aretz, the financial markets editor and a financial reporter. I
was the financial reporter for the IDF radio and I am a regular
commentator on radio today.








I hold a Master in Business Administration from The Kellogg School of
Northwestern University and The Recanati School of Tel Aviv University
and a B.A in economics from the Tel Aviv University.

I hope that you will be able to grant me the interview, and thank you in
advance for your kind consideration.

Sincerely yours,



Guy Rolnik
