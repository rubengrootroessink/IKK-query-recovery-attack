WE NEED YOUR HELP

How Can We Better Meet Your Needs?

This year, e-FFICIENCY NEWS has a new editor and a new production schedule.
First, e-FFICIENCY NEWS has upgraded from a bimonthly to a monthly
newsletter.  In order to make e-FFICIENCY NEWS more responsive, more
interactive, and more useful, we need your help.  Please fill out a brief
survey and tell us how to make e-FFICIENCY NEWS better fit your needs.

The survey can be found at:

CALL TO ACTION

Alliance Activists Can Make a Difference

As the country deals with a mounting energy crisis, the Department of Energ=
y
(DOE) may be planning an estimated 30-35 percent cut in the energy
efficiency and renewable energy research and development programs budget.
The Alliance calls on all responsible citizens to  encourage the
administration to do the right thing.  Becoming an Alliance Activist is the
first step.

Become an Alliance Activist:

Senator Bingaman, Democrats, Introduce Centrist Energy Bill

Senator Jeff Bingaman (NM), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Energy and
Natural Resources Committee and Chair of the Alliance to Save Energy,
introduced comprehensive legislation to shape the nation's energy policy.
``If we want to tackle [our energy] problem[s] head-on, we need a
comprehensive plan that commits to increasing domestic production and to
using energy more efficiently throughout the economy.  I believe this
legislation sets out that plan," Bingaman said.

Secretary Abraham Looks for Energy in Wrong Places

Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, addressing the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
noted:  =01&America faces a major energy supply crisis over the next two
decades.=018  But Abraham, like President Bush, is looking mainly to increa=
se
our supply of oil, coal, and natural gas, rather than approach both the
supply and demand sides of the issue.  Secretary Abraham mentioned energy
efficiency only once in his entire speech, even though a reduction in deman=
d
is the quickest, cleanest, cheapest (and most reliable!) energy source at
our disposal.

Democratic Task Force Weighs in on Bush Budget

Last week, House Democrats threw their hat into the ring as the Democratic
Caucus Energy Task Force held a news conference decrying Bush Administratio=
n
intentions to cut energy research significantly in their FY 2002 budget.
The Alliance is quoted in their report, which emphasizes the role of
research and development in providing long-term energy solutions.

Senate Hearing Examines Energy-Environmental Relationship

Alliance president David Nemtzow testified at a March 21 Senate Environment
Committee Subcommittee hearing on the relationship of energy policies and
environmental policies.  Nemtzow pointed out that energy efficiency is now
our nation=01,s second largest energy source.  He also offered a series of
recommendations for the Senators simultaneously to promote energy and
environmental goals.

IPCC: Energy Efficiency is Key in Mitigating Climate Change

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released the third and
final volume of its Third Assessment Report on climate change, which
examines climate change mitigation strategies and places a heavy emphasis o=
n
using energy wisely. The report finds that energy efficiency for buildings,
transportation, and industry could account for more than half of the
potential greenhouse gas reductions achievable by 2020. Natural gas
technologies, more efficient power plant technologies, and combined heat an=
d
power play an important role in reducing fossil energy power plant
emissions. And "low-carbon energy systems," such as renewable energy, can
also make an important contribution. Perhaps equally important is the
finding that there is "no single path to a low emission future."

Barriers to Energy Efficiency In Public, Private Organizations

There is a gap between the opportunities for cost-effective energy-
efficiency investment identified in energy models and the levels actually
seen in practice, according to SPRU, a science and technology policy
research group in England. The origins of the gap are claimed to lie in a
series of barriers, such as lack of capital, lack of information or hidden
costs, which prevent markets for energy and energy-using technologies from
operating efficiently.  SPRU says that understanding the size and nature of
this gap is essential if policies to mitigate climate change through
improved energy efficiency are to be successful. These policies must succee=
d
in the context of liberalizing energy markets and increasing interest in th=
e
development of a broadly based energy service industry.

State of the World Report

From the thinning of the Arctic sea ice to the invasion of the
mosquito-borne West Nile virus, the Worldwatch Institute's State of the
World 2001 shows how the economic boom of the last decade has damaged
natural systems.   The report takes a fresh look at the most difficult
challenge the world faces: how to build an environmentally sustainable
economy before we do permanent damage to the natural systems that support
our global civilization.

Dallas Cleans the Air with the IECC Energy Code

The North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG) voted this month to
adopt the 2000 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) for the Dallas
region.  This area accounts for almost 50,000 housing starts a year, more
than are built in 42 states.  One of the main reasons for adopting the code
is the area's commitment to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions as part of the
Texas state plan for controlling smog.  Since the IECC contains a new
standard for reducing window solar heat gain, which reduces air conditionin=
g
energy use substantially, it cuts NOx emissions from the power plants that
serve the air conditioning load.  The Alliance supported Public Citizen, th=
e
Texas Building Energy Institute, the Sustainable Living Alliance, NCTCOG
staff, and others in this effort, working with the Building Codes Assistanc=
e
Project and Alliance Associates.

Alliance Associates Honored with Awards

Many Alliance Associates were honored at the 2001 Energy Star Awards
Ceremony, hosted by the US Environmental Protection Agency and the
Department of Energy.  Additionally, the Industrial Energy Technology
Conference (IETC) has selected Alliance Associate Owens Corning for a
prestigious award for outstanding contributions to industrial energy
efficiency and environmental stewardship.

EYE OPENERS

Energy Efficiency Facts Even Children Can Understand

A vacant house at 55 Fahrenheit uses more energy for heating than an
occupied one at 68 Fahrenheit, according to GPU Energy.  The activity in an
occupied house radiates a certain amount of heat and some of the energy
users in your home are still operating while you areaway. Designed
specifically for teachers and students, the GPU website features
energy-related games, activities, experiments, downloadable teaching
modules, and lesson plans on a variety of energy, electrical safety, energy
conservation, and environment-related topics.
