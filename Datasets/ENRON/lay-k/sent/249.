Subject: Portfolio Company Presentations - Reminder

Just a reminder that your portfolio company presentations are due on Monday 
3/19th.  Gene will need to get his copies by mail, so please make sure Lilia 
has a copy to include in the mailing paket to him by 4PM on Monday.  If you 
are not planning to meet that deadline, please see Lilia about how you can 
get your presentation to Gene.

The first drafts were a good start.  Most, however, read more like a pitch  
[Paige, Barbara]  than an assessment/evaluation.  As you make your revisions, 
keep in mind that your objective should be to provide a succinct, but 
thorough assessment of the investment that will inform a discussion on how to 
best add value and manage the investment going forward.

If you have not gotten my feedback and would like it, we can arrange to speak 
over the weekend.  I will be traveling, but if you leave a voice message, we 
can arrange a time to speak.  I will be generally available by phone Saturday 
morning through early afternoon.

Thanks,
Barbara
