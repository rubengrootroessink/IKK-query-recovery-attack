Hi Jeanine -

I have checked with Jeff Skilling's office and he is not available on June 
26.  May we go back to the drawing board?  We can offer some time in the 
afternoon of August 7, 8 or 9 - possibly 2:00 p.m. on one of those days.  
Those dates are currently good for Ken Lay, Jeff Skilling and Dave Delainey.  
Please advise at your earliest convenience.

Rosalee
