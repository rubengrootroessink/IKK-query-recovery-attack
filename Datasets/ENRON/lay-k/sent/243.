Mr. Stelzer, Steve Kean is out of town until Wednesday, but in regard to your 
question about Rupert, Ken said that our people are already talking to Fox.  
He said he'll get back with you if we need a meeting with Rupert.

Thanks.

Rosalee

Will do -- and I assume I can go ahead with all of the suggestions in my
outline. Right? Also, now that you are free of Blockbuster, should you and
Rupert get together again?
