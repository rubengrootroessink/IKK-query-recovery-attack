THE FOX WATCH!

   1. This IMI presents an overview of what are
expected to be the environmental priorities for Mexico's new administration.
The new administration in Mexico has mentioned the following as priority
areas for development over the next six years.

-Review the present environmental standards (NOM's). Make changes to
increase the compliance of micro, small and mid-sized companies.

-Study ways the private sector can participate in the development of
infrastructure to treat and dispose of industrial waste. Implement programs
to facilitate this.

-Launch special programs for large private consumers of potable water to
encourage the use of recycled water.

-Increase federal expenditures on environmental infrastructure along the
Mexico -U.S. border.


2. Implications for U.S. companies: U.S. manufacturers of equipment and
providers of environmental services should be able to increase their market
share during the next six years because of the priorities mentioned above.

3. Companies interested in selling equipment and services should contact:
