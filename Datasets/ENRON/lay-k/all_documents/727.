**********************************
New Jersey - Dick Zimmer

Former Congressman Dick Zimmer is a fiscally responsible,
socially moderate Republican who wants to reclaim the House seat
he held for three terms before his unsuccessful bid for U.S. Senate.
Most polls have him with a slight lead over his opponent.

To help Dick Zimmer, please visit

ck+Zimmer.htm .

******************************************
Illinois - Mark Kirk

Mark Kirk is stressing fiscal conservatism and common-sense
improvements to schools and education. He has vowed to hold
the line on wasteful spending and insist on a balanced budget.
A recent A Chicago Tribune/WGN-TV poll has this race within the
margin of error.  To help Mark Kirk's campaign, visit

+Kirk.htm.

**************************************************
Indiana - John Hostettler

U.S. Representative John Hostettler faces a tough challenge from
Paul Perry, an orthopedic surgeon who has used his medical
connections to raise substantial amounts of money.  However,
Rep. Hostettler cannot be underestimated and has earned an 83%
rating with the U.S. Chamber in 1999.  Business should stand by
his side in this election that will likely be won by a narrow margin.

Hostettler.htm.

**************************************************
Kentucky - Ernie Fletcher

Rep. Ernie Fletcher, who earned a 96% positive voting record
with the Chamber, is in a tough race and has come under heavy
criticism from anti-business forces for his votes supporting the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce's positions.   His loss would be a
symbolic victory for anti-business interests, which would like to
claim that his support of pro-business positions caused his
defeat.

e+Fletcher.htm.

**************************************************
Michigan - Mike Rogers

Mr. Rogers is the cofounder of a family building business, an
ex-Army officer, and a former FBI special agent. He has a strong
understanding of the need to create and maintain a pro-business
environment.  Recent polls have him running slightly ahead of his
opponent, but the presidential campaigns make Michigan extremely
volatile.

This open seat provides business with an excellent opportunity to
pick up a pro-business candidate.  Click on the following to help
today -

+Rogers.htm.

**************************************************
Arkansas - Jay Dickey

U.S. Rep. Jay Dickey has earned an admirable 94% approval
rating from the U.S. Chamber. That's not surprising, since Dickey
is himself a small businessman, owning a number of food
franchises in Arkansas.  Rep. Dickey's opponent, State Senator
Michael Ross voted to raise the income tax rate on corporations.

**************************************************
California - Jim Rogan

Recent polling shows Rep. Jim Rogan with a slight lead over his
opponent.  However, this race is expected to be extremely close
come Election Day.  Rep. Rogan has consistently taken positions
supporting free enterprise, sponsoring legislation supporting
small businesses, voting for tax reforms and free trade and
advocating other key pro-business positions.  To help his
campaign, please visit

**************************************************
California - Steve Kuykendall

California's 36th District is a battleground this year with U.S.
Rep. Steve Kuykendall facing off against the previous
seatholder, Jane Harman. For business, the choice in this race
is clear: it's Kuykendall, who has voted with the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce 92% of the time. A true friend of free enterprise,
Rep. Kuykendell has earned the business community's support
or another term.

**************************************************
California - Brian Bilbray

Rep. Brian Bilbray is in his toughest race since he ousted then-
Rep. Lynn Schenk in 1994.  As a business owner, Rep. Bilbray
understands the impact regulations and taxes can have on small
businesses. For his pro-business efforts, the U.S. Chamber
endorses Bilbray for re-election and hopes you will help his
campaign by visiting -
