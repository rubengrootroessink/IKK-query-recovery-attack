Family,
Jose Luis and I would like to plan on coming to Aspen
on Friday December 29th through January 6th.  We would
like to stay in the Old house with you, if possible
and preferrably either the front bedroom or the guest
cottage. Please let us know if this is possible as I
need to make airline reservations ASAP.
Thanks,
love,
Liz
