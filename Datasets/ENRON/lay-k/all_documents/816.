Ken,

Since you sit on the board of TCW, I thought you should be aware of the 
information contained below. I will keep you posted on any progress, if you 
so desire. 

See you in San Antonio.

Regards,
Doug

Mr. Nicholas (Nick) Tell, Managing Director of the Trust Company of the West 
(TCW) has invited Enron Global Fuels to attend a meeting on Wednesday, 
November 29 at 3:00pm at the Orion Refinery in Norco, La. with the following 
individuals:

Mr. David Matlin, Managing Director Workouts & Special Situations of Credit 
Suisse/First Boston
Mr. George Sutherland, Vice President Commercial of Orion Refining Corp.
Mr. Clark Johnson, President of Orion Refining Corp. (formerly with Frontier)
Mr. Nicholas Tell

The purpose of this meeting is to follow up on a meeting with CSFB last week 
and a conversation with Mr. Tell today to explore opportunities between Enron 
and Orion. These opportunities may include crude oil supply, refined products 
offtake, risk management services and possible financing of refinery 
improvements that may be repaid in products rather than cash. 

Note--ownership of this refinery is broken out as follows--CSFB (68%), 
Jefferies (18%), TCW (10%) and Oaktree (4%). Jack Stanley is totally out of 
the picture. The refinery is currently running at 145,000 bpd and is badly in 
need of a reformer which would be at least a 15 month project.
