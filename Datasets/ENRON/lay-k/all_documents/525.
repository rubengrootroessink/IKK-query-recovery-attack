EFFICIENCY NEWS

New Proposed Air Conditioner, Heat Pump Standards Fall Short

The new air conditioner energy efficiency standards proposed by the U.S.
Department of Energy fall short of what's justified and what's needed to
lighten the load on electricity demand, says the Alliance to Save Energy. In
a humorous ad campaign developed by the Appliance Standards Awareness
project and featuring Energy Secretary Bill Richardson in digitally-inserted
sunglasses, energy efficiency advocates, urge strong air conditioner
standards. Air conditioners are the largest single contributors to peak
electricity demand - an issue the past two summers as peak demands created
and threatened blackouts and brownouts in various locations. This proposed
legislation is currently in a 60-day public comment period, allowing for
input from interested parties, after which the DOE will issue the final
rule.

Winter Fuel Outlook Bleak, EIA Reveals in New Report

The U.S. Energy Information Administration predicts that natural gas prices
will increase by as much as 40 to 50 percent for consumers this winter over
last winter, or an average of $240 per consumer home, in its Winter Fuels
Outlook, released on October 6. Home heating oil prices are expected to rise
by $190 per home from last year's already high prices in the Northeast,
while electricity prices could increase by as much as 12 percent.
Predictions are based on normal winter weather, and prices could escalate
even further should the weather prove to be colder than normal.

--------------------------------

Gains Expected in Federal Budget for Energy Efficiency Programs

Holding a strong hand due to concerns over sharply rising energy prices and
low winter natural gas and heating oil inventories, and backed by a strong
lobbying effort from the Alliance to Save Energy  and others, the Clinton
administration is expected to win substantial gains for energy efficiency
programs in recently concluded negotiations with Congressional appropriators
over the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the Environmental Protection
Agency budget. A total of $814 million is being appropriated for energy
efficiency research, development and deployment programs, run by the DOE's
Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, in increase of $94
million, or 13 percent over the previous budget.

information based on Congressional and Presidential action.

Avoid Home Energy $ticker $hock

If you thought it was expensive to pay up to $2 a gallon for gas this
summer, you'll have continued "$ticker $hock" when your home energy bills
arrive this winter with predicted increases. How to avoid it -- check out
the Alliance to Save Energy tips to cut home heating oil and natural gas
bills.

Energy Heats Up Election

Each presidential candidate stated his energy policy in the first
presidential debate in Boston, MA, on October 3. Vice President Al Gore's
plan focuses on increasing supply and decreasing demand, while Texas
Governor George W. Bush's plan emphasizes developing domestic energy
supplies. The vice presidential candidates faced off in Danville, KY on
October 5, both echoing the positions of their presidential running mates.

California, New York Make Dramatic Boosts for Energy-Efficiency Funding

In California, bills signed by Governor Gray Davis last week re-assert
California's leadership status on support for energy efficiency and other
clean energy sources. Two bills extend California's system benefits charge
through 2012, while adding an inflation adjustment, creating more than $5
billion of investment in clean energy from 2002-2012. This may be the
largest clean energy fund ever created. A third major bill will speed the
adoption of cost-effective buildings and appliance standards. These measures
are expected to maximize peak energy savings for the summer of 2001, and to
lessen future energy reliability problems.

ed.html

And in Los Angeles, the City Council approved a 10-year power plan that will
meet roughly half of the 1000 megawatts of new power capacity with renewable
energy sources, distributed generation, and demand side management.

http://www.ase.org/e-FFICIENCY/losangeles.htm

The New York State Public Service Commission has proposed increasing the
state's System Benefits Charge from its current $78 million to $139 million
per year, and extending it for five years. About 70 percent of the current
$78 million is used for energy efficiency programs. If this formula holds,
efficiency funding would increase to about $97 million - an 80 percent
increase from current levels. Energy advocates are seeking SBC funding
closer to the $200 million level.

EPA, DOE Release Fuel Economy Guide for Energy Awareness Month

Kicking off Energy Awareness Month in October, the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy issued the latest
version of the Fuel Economy Guide. Including the 2001 model year, this guide
ranks the fuel efficiency of vehicles in various class sizes. The Toyota
Prius and Honda Insight currently top the list for fuel efficiency.

Light Up Your Life with ENERGY STAR

ENERGY STAR's Lighting Change Out program takes place this week. A
first-time event involving utilities and retailers across the U.S., the
program encourages consumers to trade in halogen lamps for cooler, ENERGY
STAR labeled, efficient models. Each halogen torchiere that is replaced by
an ENERGY STAR torchiere can save $25-$50 per year in energy costs.

Living Efficiently and Affordably

The U.S. Department of Energy has partnered with the housing industry
through the Building American Program to build affordable, highly
energy-efficient homes throughout the U.S. The Fairburn Commons complex in
an Atlanta suburb opened with 33 units, each of which will cost less than
$1/day to heat and cool.

http://www.doe.gov/news/releases00/seppr/pr00240.htm


Meanwhile, the National Affordable Housing Network released a report on new
energy-efficient, affordable homes built in Texas. Built in partnership with
Habitat for Humanity International, these 40 homes use up to 42 percent less
energy than an average new home. Reduced monthly energy bills are
particularly critical for low-income residents.
