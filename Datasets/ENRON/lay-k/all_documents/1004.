Dear Ken,

My son, Richard, recently sold his interest in a dot.com company and is
working for KPMG Consulting. He is interested in moving to Texas. I have
attached a copy of his resume. If you hear of anything that might fit,
please keep him in mind.

Is there any truth to the rumor that you are going to be the next Secretary
of the Treasury?

Thanks,

Nancy George
