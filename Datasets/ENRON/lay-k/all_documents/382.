Good morning, Joe.  Ken is on a cruise, so is not available, but I did talk 
to Steve (he is traveling, but said he is trying to get in touch with you).  
Apparently, everything is still internal.  He said everything is fine, so 
hopefully, you don't need to be concerned.

Talk to you soon.

Rosie

Subject: Selection Of My Successor-My Concern

Ken: I have "heard" from two sources in this office that Enron will announce 
my successor today. I have not been advised of the selection and am concerned 
that this announcement will not treat my retirement in an appropriate and 
deserving manner.

I have placed calls to Steve Kean since hearing this rumor but have not 
received a response as of now. Admittedl, our phone service because of the 
office construction is not totally functioning.

Frankly, I think this matter has not been handled in a caring way and I have 
been acccused of giving information on the selection to Tom DeLay which is 
untrue. My office mates are all more aware of the candidates and their status 
than I have been.

I regret having to contact you on this matter but feel that despite my total 
cooperation, allegiance and dedication to Enron, I am not being treated with 
the courtesy and sensitivity that this matter deserves.

Joe
