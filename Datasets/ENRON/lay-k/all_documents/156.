Dictated letter from Ken Lay

Dear John:

I enjoyed your recent e-mail.  I also appreciate your kind comments 
concerning our broadband activity.  The deal with Blockbuster has been a 
great deal of fun and is opening up all kinds of additional opportunities.

I enjoyed looking through the agenda for your meeting in Sweden.  It looks 
quite informative and interesting.  Sweden is also an excellent place for a 
summer conference.

The young man you refer to in your letter should send his resume to Celeste 
Roberts at (713) 853-0555.  If he would also copy me on the letter to 
Celeste, I would be happy to follow up and make sure it is carefully 
considered.

I'm delighted that your life appears to be going very well at the current 
time.  I hope our paths will again cross in Aspen or elsewhere in the not too 
distant future.

Warm regards,

Ken
