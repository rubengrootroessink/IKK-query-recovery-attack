Dear Chamber Members,

The time for you to make a difference is now!

We have only 10 days until we elect a new president and a new
Congress, and the U.S. Chamber needs your help.  The U.S.
Chamber of Commerce represents you - America's business
community - and now is when we can make a difference.

Helping to elect pro-business candidates is not something we
should take for granted. That's why the U.S. Chamber has been
working hard over the past few months to help pro-business
candidates get elected. We've endorsed these candidates,
campaigned on their behalf, donated to their campaigns, and,
most importantly, lent them the awesome reputation of the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce.

We now need your help to make sure we are successful on
November 7th.  Please take a moment now and visit the
Elections 2000 page on our web site.  This page can be
found by going to http://www.uschamber.com/Elections/.

Once there, click on Pro-Business Candidates and you will find a
list of the candidates we are actively campaigning for and
support along with information about their race.  After you select
a particular candidate, we have also made it possible for you to
contribute directly to selected campaigns by selecting Contribute
On-line Now!

I would also ask that you take a moment to read a recent op-ed by
U.S. Chamber CEO Tom Donohue.  This op-ed titled - Business
As the Target - highlights the attacks the business community is
under from anti-business candidates.  I also feel it underscores the
importance of helping to elect and voting for pro-business
candidates!

To read Mr. Donohue's op-ed, please click here -

Or, to help elect pro-business candidates, please:

1. Visit http://www.uschamber.com/Elections/
2. Click on Pro-Business Candidates
3. Select the candidate you would like to support!
4. Make a contribution of $150, $100, $75, or $50 directly to their campaign!

Please feel free to email me if you have any questions or if I can be of
assistance to you.  And, thank you for helping us to elect candidates
who support business!

Sincerely,

Bill Miller
Political Director


P.S.  Please visit http://www.uschamber.com/Elections/, select a
pro-business candidate, and make a contribution directly to their
campaign.  Remember there are only 10 days left until the
election, so they need support from the business community now.
