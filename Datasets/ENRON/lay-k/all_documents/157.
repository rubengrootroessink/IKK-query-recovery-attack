Letter dictated by Ken Lay

Gene:

 I appreciated the update on your health status.  It appears you are taking a 
very tough situation and, with help from some of the best doctors in the 
world, setting about to turn it around.  I'm sure it goes without saying that 
you know we are all pulling for you and betting on a positive outcome.

 Clearly your health is the number one issue now.  To the extent you want to 
work and can work, we are delighted to have you back in the office.  But that 
is a very distant secondary concern until you get everything done about your 
health that can be done.  If there is any way I or Enron can be of any 
further help, please let me know.

Ken
