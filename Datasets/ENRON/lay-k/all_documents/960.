This message is a request to Enron to abandon the wind power project which
would desecrate sacred burial and cultural sites and threaten endangered
species and the scenic area in the Columbia River Gorge area.  The area,
located near Celilo Falls and the confluence of the Columbia River with the
John Day and Deschutes Rivers is renowned for its environmental, scenic,
Indigenous and European cultural and historical significance.
