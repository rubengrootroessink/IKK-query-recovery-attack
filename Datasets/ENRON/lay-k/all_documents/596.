We are looking forward to having you at the video taping we are doing for the 
Management Conference.  We will be taping at Houston Studios on Thursday, 
October 19, from 4:00-6:00 p.m.  As mentioned in our earlier e-mail, we want 
the atmosphere to be comfortable, so we ask that you dress casually, or at 
least take off your suit coat, loosen your tie, roll up your sleeves and 
relax.  It would be best if you did not wear a white shirt, as it tends to 
wash out on video.    

Please try to get there as close to 4:00 p.m. as possible -- even a little 
before would be great.  We'll have someone ready to apply a little make-up 
and get you miked.

Directions:  The studio is located at 707 Walnut Street.  To get there from 
the Enron Building, take Clay to Main Street and make a left onto Main.  Turn 
right on Texas, and left on San Jacinto.  Turn right onto Wood Street which 
will dead-end and you will have to take a left onto Walnut.  The building 
will be on your left and the entrance is located in the middle of the 
building.  There is visitor parking in the front.

The phone number of the studio is 713/223-0951.

If things change on your schedule and you cannot make the video shoot, please 
let me know as quickly as possible.  It will make a difference in how we 
frame the shot, so it's important that we have advance notice.

We look forward to seeing you on Thursday.

Terrie, here is the memo I was planning to send out re: the taping on 
Thursday.  Feel free to make whatever changes you feel necessary.  I'd like 
to get it out this afternoon.

sleeves and relax.  It would be best if you did not wear a white shirt, as it

you will be individually miked.  Please try to get there as close to 4:00
