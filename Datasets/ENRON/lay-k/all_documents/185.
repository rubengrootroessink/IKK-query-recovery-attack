Ken,

It has been a pleasure serving on the Diversity Task Force for Enron and 
sharing in your vision for all employees.  My membership on the team is being 
transferred to someone else within our organization.  I trust that many of 
the Diversity Action Steps  will be implemented and accomplished this year.

Thanks again,

Daler
