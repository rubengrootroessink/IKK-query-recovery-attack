Raman,

This is outstanding news, although you folks at OPO are setting such high 
standards that very little surprises me anymore. Please forward this to all 
the OPO team and let them know that both Sanjay and I are very happy over 
this great news of 100% availability, and we really appreciate the hard 
efforts of the entire team and their families to make this happen. We both 
look forward to travelling to Dabhol soon and congratulating the team in 
person.

Congratulations again.

Wade
