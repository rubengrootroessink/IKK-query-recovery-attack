Sally, Could you please see that Ken gets this? What is his email address? I
dont have it. The work that Loyal and his staff have done on this is
impressive, even though it took a long time for me to bring this up on my
computer, I think because it was such a big file. Love. Bonnie

Hi Bonnie whose girdle one time exploded. Do you
remember that incident??? Kenny and I still
remember! The reason for the message is that I
wanted to send you the address of  LFGA which is
as follows:
http://www.geocities.com/heartland/acres/8896/index.html
       You should look at Line #4 which is our
line of the Lay family. Turn your speakers on
cause you will hear some music. I am now the
President of this organization so I am trying to
get my all of my line to pay some attention to
their lineage.  We just got back from North West
Arkansas. Looking at some housing. Thinking of
making a move. Regards-Loyal
