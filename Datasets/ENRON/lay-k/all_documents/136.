Dear Mr. Lay,

As you are no doubt aware your colleague Jeffrey Skilling  recently made a=
=20
keynote address at our flagship event RISK 2000 in Boston.  Building on the=
=20
success of that event, I would like to invite you to make the  keynote=20
address at Energy & Power Risk Management  Conferences=01, third annual=20
information technology event as  outlined above. This year's keynote sessio=
n=20
is entitled "The E-Commerce Revolution: Innovations and  opportunity in the=
=20
electronic energy marketplace". This session has no  bullet points as I wou=
ld=20
like the speaker to address only the latest issues as  they see fit. My=20
research has showed that the industry is very interested in  your opinions =
on=20
this subject and I hope you can fit this hour-long session into  you busy=
=20
schedule.

=01+Information Technology=01, will take a focused look  at the latest adva=
nces=20
being made in the energy market=01,s systems and  technologies. The confere=
nce=20
will be structured in two streams, offering  delegates and speakers the=20
chance to tailor the event to their own areas of  interest. The streams wil=
l=20
be partitioned into five areas:=20

1) Information technology for risk management

2) Information technology for pricing and trading

3) Data techniques and strategies

4) Advanced technologies for trading and risk management

5) Challenges of the evolving energy marketplace

Each of these categories will investigate the kind of problems  being faced=
=20
by energy IT/IS managers, traders and risk managers alike. I have  attached=
 a=20
copy of the program for your information. There will also be a  software=20
exhibition at the conference at which vendors will be demonstrating  their=
=20
products, as well as a post-conference seminar on data management.

This conference will be of the highly technical level that  people have com=
e=20
to expect from EPRM events, and I am very keen to encourage  participation=
=20
from speakers in modifying the program to suit the audience and  issues at=
=20
hand. If you have any suggestions or comments on the programme, please  let=
=20
me know; any help would be gratefully received.

This event will be thoroughly marketed through both Energy  & Power Risk=20
Management Magazine and our extensive database. It is my aim to  attract th=
e=20
leading market players by providing a first-class program with  top-rated=
=20
speakers, making this a highly worthwhile event for the energy  industry.

Unfortunately my schedule for this program is very tight. I  would greatly=
=20
appreciate an email soon to let me know if you would like to take  part in=
=20
this event. If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to  ge=
t=20
in touch.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours sincerely,

Joel Hanley
