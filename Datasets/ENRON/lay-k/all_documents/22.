The attachment to the below message from the law firm of Winthrop, Stimsom, 
Putnam &Roberts is a very well done summary of the Kyoto Protocol.  I 
attended  the American Society for Quality Energy and Environmental Division 
conference last week and was impressed by this presentation.  Enron is 
mentioned significantly in this paper and since I was the only Enron employee 
in attendance I got a lot of questions from other conferees about who we are 
and what we do.  Thank goodness I paid attention at the new hire orientation 
last month.  I believe there are many others at Enron who would enjoy reading 
this and will let your office make that distribution.  It looks best printed 
on a good color printer.
