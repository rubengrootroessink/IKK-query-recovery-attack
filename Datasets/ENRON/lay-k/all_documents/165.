Thank you, Rosalee.  I will be forwarding to you Monday, a briefing package 
that will provide Mr. Lay with background on the proposed transaction, the 
client and client representatives.   Please let Lety Smith, who is my 
administrative support (ext 36562) know if Mr. Lay will need it sooner.   
Lety will page me in the field to make alternative arrangements.

Michael Mann

Subject: Owens-Illinois Meeting

We have confirmed a meeting to introduce you to Tom Young, EVP (and member, 
O-I Board of Directors) and members of his management team at O-I 
Headquarters next Tuesday, 8/15 at 11:30 am.  We have 90 minutes, Mr. Young 
will be hosting us to lunch during our meeting.  Joe Lemieux, CEO, is 
unavailable only because his calendar just didn't match up with your near 
term available dates.  My strong bias is that the sooner we have an 
opportunity to connect at the top the better, especially given our drive to 
close in Q-3.

In addition to coordinating logistics, I will get briefing packets to your 
offices Monday describing the proposed transaction, deal related issues 
(details are not likely to come up during the meeting), key O-I personnel 
bios, and general information about O-I and its current business, including 
summary outside financial analysis.

Regards,
Michael
