Hi Corey -

My champion, hero, angel - I think I have made a major mistake!!!  I thought 
I had tickets to Mark McGuire's team for May 12, but it is the Cinncinatti 
Reds!!!  I am so sorry.  Is that going to be o.k.?  That's  what I get for 
thinking I know anything about baseball.

Look forward to hearing from you!!

Love,

Aunt Rosie
