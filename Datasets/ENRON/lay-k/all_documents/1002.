  Hi Mr. Ramsay -

  In regard to your request for Ken to chair a Forum segment
and join the
  Ministerial dinner, with the Chair of the other Session in
May, he said
  that he would be delighted to participate.

  We look forward to receiving additional information after
the Governing
  Board has its meeting.
