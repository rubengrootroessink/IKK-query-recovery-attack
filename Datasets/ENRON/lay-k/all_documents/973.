Pleased to send you the November report. Obviously the market is weakening
in North America which is making the quarter challenging but the underlying
momentum of the company continues to improve as the report illustrates.
Look forward to seeing you at the Board meeting.

Peter

> communicated - in particular strengthening the integration of our upstream
> and downstream operations.  I'm also excited about Bo McBee and his
> worldwide team in Corporate Quality and Customer Satisfaction officially
> joining our organization.  He and his team are doing a great job, and
> together we will further our efforts to become the leader throughout the
> world in satisfying our customers.
>
> Most of all, I am extremely pleased and encouraged because I believe these
> changes confirm the great work you have accomplished this year.  We've
> already reported a number of major wins as a result of the joint efforts
> by our Sales and Services teams.  There is an air of excitement and
> anticipation about Compaq's momentum - I see it in the emails from many of
> you and as I meet with our teams and customers around the world.  You're a
> remarkable team and, as Michael puts it, let's keep the pedal to the metal
> and keep the momentum strong as we work to successfully close 2000!
>
> Speaking of my travels...
> This month I visited Johannesburg, South Africa, Dubai within the United
> Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia.  All of these countries are part of
> EMEA's Business Development Group (BDG), which is responsible for
> developing Compaq business in 98 countries. The group is focused on both
> developed and emerging markets in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and
> Africa. Over the past six years, BDG has grown its revenue more than
> 10-fold.
>
> In South Africa I visited Vodacom, which with 4 million subscribers, is
> Africa's largest mobile phone network operator.  The company has just
> upgraded its billing systems to handle further expansion, and to date is
> one of the world's largest Wildfire installations with some 21 AlphaServer
> GS systems.  I also spent time with the management of Mobile Telephone
> Networks (MTN), South Africa's #2 cellphone operator and another big
> Wildfire customer.  In fact, we just got word that they've placed a $10M
> order for four GS320 AlphaServer systems and storage.
>
> One of my more interesting activities while there was learning more about
> Ikageng, a Compaq-led initiative to bring the benefits of the information
> age to the rural communities of Africa.  Ikageng brings together the
> provision of safe drinking water, affordable healthcare, distance
> learning, improved subsistence farming techniques and Internet access.
> All of this is co-funded by a community bank, together with Compaq,
> Johnnic, a South African media and information group, and the active
> participation of the World Bank.  A real example of Inspiration Technology
> at work!
>
> My visit to the United Arab Emirates included a dinner with our top 30
> customers from across the region, a VIP lunch with our top partners, as
> well as meetings with employees in the region.  I also attended Gitex, the
> region's largest IT exhibition, and met with press at that event to convey
> Compaq's commitment to the UAE.  I was also privileged to have a personal
> meeting with His Highness Sheik Mohamad bin Rashid al Maktoum, Crown
> Prince of Dubai and the Minister of Defense.  These meetings were around
> the official opening of Dubai Internet City, an area of Dubai dedicated to
> making the city the "Silicon Valley"  of the Middle East.
>
> I spent a very interesting day at Aramco in Saudi Arabia, our largest
> account in the UAE. We are the ProLiant standard in this very large energy
> company and we have a great opportnuity to build a strong partnership
> across many additional solutions including high performance technical
> computing, ZLE applications and enterprise storage, in addition to
> recapturing client business from the competition
>

> EMEA to open Wireless Competence Centre in Stockholm
> Press, customers and partners have been invited to help officially open
> the Compaq Wireless Competence Centre in Stockholm, Sweden, on November

> Planning for Innovate Forum 2001 under way
> Compaq's premier event for its global and large account customers -
> Innovate Forum 2001 - is set for May 23-24 at the George R. Brown
> Convention Center in Houston.  The hand-picked guest list will include
> some 4,000-5,000 senior-level technical and business executives, including
> our key channel partners, press, industry and financial analysts, and

> Cross Border Office files first lawsuit
> The Cross Border Office has been created to prevent unauthorized movement
> of Compaq products by dealers and gray market brokers in order to protect
> profit margins and ultimately, customer satisfaction.  The Cross Border
> team provides gray market awareness training to all sales personnel, mail
> and phone hotline access to report gray market activity, works jointly
> with regional sales, services, business unit and channel teams to create
> policy and procedures to reduce gray market activity and, working with the
> Law department, to bring legal action against gray market brokers if
> warranted.
>
> As a result of these efforts, Compaq has filed its first lawsuit against
> two Canadian technology consulting firms for breach of contract and fraud.
> The suit, which seeks compensatory damages of more than $17 million,
> claims the consulting firms fraudulently represented to Compaq that they
> had a contract with the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal
> Aviation Administration to supply a large number of computers and related
> equipment to U.S. airports. This lawsuit hit many national publications
> and sends a message to the worldwide gray market community that Compaq
> will take actions to protect its authorized resellers, product quality and
> our customers.
>
> For further information on the Cross Border Office, gray market red flags

> Key Channel Partner programs rolling out
> Early this year the Tigerbite project was established to redefine and
> simplify Compaq's model with our channel partners.  A key element of the
> model is worldwide programs that provide profitable growth opportunities
> for Compaq and its partners.  Two such programs - Internet List Pricing
> (ILP) and the Compaq Agent Program - are currently being implemented by
> the regions.
>
> Worldwide implementation of ILP is a top priority for the company.
> Creating and publishing (where needed) competitive List Prices is
> absolutely essential to establishing a more consistent, worldwide pricing
> model for both our customers and partners. By the end of this month ILP
> will have been implemented in North America, Latin America, Japan and
> Greater China, with pilot programs in Singapore and Malaysia.  EMEA and
> the remaining Asia Pacific countries are expected to complete the rollout
> by January 1, 2001.
>
> The Compaq Agent Program, which allows partners to earn commissions when
> they refer customers to purchase products/services directly from us,
> currently has been implemented in the U.S., Latin America (14 countries)
> and CKK.  This month, APD is implementing pilot programs in Singapore and
> Malaysia, and plans to roll out the program in seven additional countries
> in the first quarter.  EMEA held an Agent Program Summit this month with
> 10 countries to assess and develop their 2001 rollout plans which include
> adding Enterprise-class products to their program next year.
>
> News from the Compaq Alliances team
> *      Compaq regained the #1 platform partner position with SAP with 33%
> market share over all platforms (NT, UNIX with R/3, and mySAP.com). IBM is
> 2nd in line with 23% share. In North America alone, our overall SAP share
> increased from 25% to 32% in the third quarter.  As an aside, SAP's entire
> executive board and senior executive staff use our iPAQ Pocket PCs.
> Rollout of the product to SAP Sales and Marketing is also in progress -- a
> very visible endorsement of Compaq's leadership in Internet access as it
> applies to enterprise applications.
> * Cable & Wireless CEO and executive visit to Marlboro in October
> included CEO Graham Wallace and 56 top C&W executives. C&W new ASP
> 'a-Services' UK launch on October 31 followed the successful U.S. launch
> in late September.
> * Compaq secured the notebook business with CGE&Y UK for their
> internal use.  Toshiba had been the incumbent for 5 years.  CGE&Y is
