I spoke to Barry Margolis this afternoon and he  confirmed Stacey's planned 
departure from Baker Botts.? Barry has spoken to  Stacy over the past week 
about it.??Stacey will be going to Goldman  Sachs October 1 to develop tax 
products.
?
Barry would like to set-up a metting with you to  discuss this.? He doesn't 
think that anyone at Baker Botts has the depth  that Stacy has.? He is also 
concerned about certain issues that may need to  be dealt with at year-end.? 
Therefore, it sounds like we need to find a  qualified replacement.
