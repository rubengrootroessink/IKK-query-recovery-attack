to whom this may concern:

I am a current student attending Brooklyn College in
Brooklyn New York.  I have a Major research to do on
your company.  I have to gather as much information as
posible on your CEO ( Kenneth Lay). By visiting the
company's website i was unable to get any helpful
information.  I am asking if you can please send me as
much information on Mr. Lay, starting from when he was
younger and what lead to his success in your company.
This will be greatly appreciated.

Sincerely Yours
Dahemah Smith
