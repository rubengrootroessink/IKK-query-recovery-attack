Subject: Good morning from Panama!

Please forward to Kenneth Lay-CEO:
 
Dear Mr. Lay,
 
It's rare that I write fan letters, but I just saw your interview on CNBC 
Squawk Box. I was very impressed with your positive message and enthusiasm 
about Enron's e-commerce platform.  
 
Thank you for the informative exchange, it was a pleasure to hear your 
refreshing outlook this early in the morning.  Those folks at CNBC can be 
tough on CEO's.
 
Prompted to visit your web site, I was impressed with Enron's worldwide 
diversity. A Texas Aggie '69, I'm proud to see a Texas company with such 
powerful skills and resources.
 
Congratulations, you represented your company very well to a worldwide TV 
audience.
 
Warmest regards,
