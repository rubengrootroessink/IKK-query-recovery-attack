Election FACT

DOES YOUR VOTE COUNT? ---- YES, and will
make the difference in helping to elect pro-business
candidates!

In 1996, Jon Fox won his congressional race in
Pennsylvania by just a 84-vote margin out of more
than a quarter million cast.

In 1994, Sam Gejdenson won his congressional race
in Connecticut by a margin of just 21 votes.
In the 1960 presidential race, John F. Kennedy
defeated Richard Nixon by two-tenths of one
percent of the vote. That averages out to less
than one vote per precinct nationwide. Furthermore,
Kennedy would have been defeated if one more
person in each of ten Cook County (Illinois) precincts
had voted for Nixon.
