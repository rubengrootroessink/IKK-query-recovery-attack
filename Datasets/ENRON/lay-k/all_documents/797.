Mike has suggested that we cut back  board meetings to fewer than the eight 
(8) we currently hold.? In order to  give you some background, Linda checked 
other peer companies and the meetings  range from 6 to 8 a year.? 
?
I think that we can cut back to 6,  however it may be more prudent to drop to 
7 this year and first see how it goes  .? The two meetings that can be 
dropped most easily are June or  September.? 
?
June,  because we have the two day strat  plan meeting in July, and Sept. 
because we don't yet have 4th quarter results  and not a lot of new 
information is available.
?
I think that the board meetings take up   an incredible amount of Compaq 
executive time and energy. I would rather have  them concentrate on getting 6 
or 7 meetings right, getting the company back on  track and? increasing 
earnings.? So, my vote is to?recommend to the board that we  eliminate the 
September '01 meeting.? That is a particularly busy month for  many people as 
exhibited by the lack of attendance we had at this past September  meeting (5 
members).? In looking back, we seem to be able to "fill the  house" in June.
?
On the other hand, you all may want to  continue with the number of meetings 
we currently have.? I will await your  reply.
?
Regards,
