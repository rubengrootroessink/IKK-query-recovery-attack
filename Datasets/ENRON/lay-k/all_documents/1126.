I think we've received everything Mr. Pershing.  We have the VIP pass for the 
car.

I just wanted to follow up to make sure that all the arrangements for Mr
Lay's trip to Paris are in order.  In particular, I wanted to make sure that
the materials for the FORUM, including the VIP pass for his car and driver
made it to you.  Please let me know if not, and I will arrange to have the
materials left at his hotel pending his arrival.

I have been in touch with Mr Bradley on input to Mr Lay's remarks, and all
seems in order on that front.

Thanks again for your help.

Best,

Jonathan Pershing
