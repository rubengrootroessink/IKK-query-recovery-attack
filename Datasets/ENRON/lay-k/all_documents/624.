   HOUSTON (AP) - Houston-based <B>Reliant</B> <B>Energy</B> Inc., has won
the naming
rights for the stadium that will be the home of the NFL's Houston
Texans, Houston TV station KRIV reported Tuesday.



  According to KRIV, the 30-year deal is worth $300 million.

   The 69,500-seat retractable-roofed stadium is on schedule to open for
the start of the 2002 NFL season. It is being constructed just yards
away from the Astrodome.
   The new stadium, billed as the only football stadium with a
retractable roof, will have 1.9 million square feet compared with 1.1
million in the Astrodome.
