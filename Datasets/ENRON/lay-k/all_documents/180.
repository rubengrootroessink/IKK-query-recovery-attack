> and gratuitous insults.  While conceding the points Judge Eckels made in
> his recent letter to the Sports Authority may be valid, Robertson,
> undaunted, attempts to discredit Eckels.  How?  By asking us to believe
> that Mr. Robertson posses clairvoyant powers.  He warns  his readers of
> his perception of  the evil state of mind of the Judge. According to
> Robertson, the arena debate is merely a political struggle, which he
> blithely characterizes as,  "Anglo Saxons vs. a Jewish owner and an
> African-American Mayor".  Outrageous! If that were not enough, Robertson

> counter productive to reaching an Arena agreement the voters will approve.

> Judge Eckels' temperate, well-reasoned letter, questions a proposal that

> Sunday, Sunny Messiah, the publisher of the Houston Defender, the leading
> Black newspaper, and an Arena supporter last time around, joined Dan

> Rocket's games, in agreeing on the Arena proposal.  That was a first for
