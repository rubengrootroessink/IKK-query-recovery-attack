Try 011-541-14516 6728, you may need the second one. Let me know if you 
continue to have problems. 
Take care, Liz

Hi Liz -

Liz - I tried to call your office number, but it doesn't go through.  Will 
you double check the number?

I haven't tried your cellular!

Dad-
My celluar number is: 011 541-14-030 5355 and my office number is 011 541 
4516 6728. I'll have an appartment number by the weekend. On my cellular, you 
can leave a message, there is a Spanish voicemail but wait until the end of 
the voicemail and there is a beep and just leave a message.  I know it is not 
easy to get in touch with me, so I will try and touch base with you. You can 
always leave a voicemail at my office in Houston and I can call you back.
Love, Liz
