HOLDING BUREAUCRATS PERSONALLY ACCOUNTABLE: A 1st Amendment Victory

The legal doctrine of "sovereign immunity" -- and its modern cousin,
"qualified immunity" -- has historically allowed government
bureaucrats to escape full accountability for misdeeds they have
perpetrated under the guise of government "policy." Thus, a recent
decision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals -- ruling that a group
of government bureaucrats may be held personally liable for
outrageous constitutional violations -- is news worthy of celebration.

The facts of the case attest to the need for strong checks on
government power. Three Berkeley, Calif., residents had campaigned
against a proposed homeless shelter in their neighborhood. At the
behest of local "housing rights" activists, who said the anti-shelter
campaign was discriminatory and violated the Fair Housing Act, the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) got into the
act. HUD officials demanded interviews with the three anti-shelter
neighbors, told their neighbors they had violated the law, and
ordered them to give HUD all materials -- including the names,
addresses and phone numbers of other opponents of the shelter -- that
they had collected for their campaign. To the "Berkeley Three," HUD's
harassment violated their freedom of speech. To the appeals court,
"qualified immunity" of government bureaucrats did not apply here;
the Berkeley Three may proceed with their First Amendment lawsuit
against the HUD officials and seek monetary damages.

This ruling, although unusual by today's standards, harks back to
another early legal tradition: the idea that citizens can hold
government officials personally liable for improper conduct. In 1763,
John Wilkes, a member of Britain's parliament, was the subject of an
outrageous search and seizure warrant issued by Secretary of State
Lord Halifax, after Wilkes published an anonymous attack on the
government. Wilkes then sued Halifax and other officials and was
awarded a sum comparable to $20 million today. Americans were so
enraptured with this refutation of unrestrained government power that
they made Wilkes a hero and followed in his footsteps, suing
government officials for unreasonable search and seizures.

Since the 19th century, however, this common-law tradition has nearly
withered away. The creation of the exclusionary rule has replaced
Wilkes's remedy with an inferior one. While the exclusionary rule
brings some satisfaction to criminals who are the subject of
unreasonable searches and seizures, it does nothing for the innocent.
Furthermore, the 20th century has seen the rise of the doctrine of
"qualified immunity," which the U.S. Supreme Court explains "seeks to
ensure that [government] defendants 'reasonably can anticipate when
their conduct may give rise to liability,' by attaching liability
only if '[t]he contours of the right [violated are] sufficiently
clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is
doing violates that right.'"

The Ninth Circuit's recent ruling that HUD officials were not acting
reasonably when they violated the First Amendment rights of the
Berkeley Three is refreshing because it rekindles the idea that civil
liability can be a restraint on government power. In an era when
bureaucratic violations of the rule of law have become routine, it is
an idea long overdue.

PUBLIC HEALTH vs. THE NANNY STATE? -- Next Independent Policy Forum (10/26/00)

Barely a day goes by without some news of the latest public health
"threat." Serious health hazards, we are told, lurk around every
corner -- in water supplies, air, soil, beverages, fast food,
second-hand smoke, cellular phones, and food irradiation, just to
name a handful. And yet, Americans today live longer than ever! Are
markets and private decision-making providing the answers? Or are
these dangers real, immediate, and a legitimate mandate for
government control? Can we reduce or eliminate health risks without
government dictates? How does politics distort perceptions about
public health? Will Americans succumb to or rebel against the growing
Nanny State's neo-Puritanism and attack on individual choice and
responsibility? JACOB SULLUM and THOMAS DiLORENZO will discuss these
timely and important issues.

SPEAKERS:

      - Jacob Sullum (Senior Editor, Reason magazine; Author, FOR YOUR
OWN GOOD: The Anti-Smoking Crusade and the Tyranny of Public Health)

      - Thomas DiLorenzo (Professor of Economics, Loyola College of

America)

About FOR YOUR OWN GOOD: The Anti-Smoking Crusade and the Tyranny of
Public Health:

"Sullum is meticulously logical, and his conclusions are implicit in
everything he argues. FOR YOUR OWN GOOD has made us think about
totalitarianism in this most unlikely context."
      - NEW YORK TIMES

"Intriguing and worthwhile, this book marshals an impressive array of
facts and arguments. Thoughtful and articulate."
      - NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE

About FROM PATHOLOGY TO POLITICS: Public Health in America:

"FROM PATHOLOGY TO POLITICS argues that public health has become a
bureaucracy that feels the need to perpetuate itself by expanding
into new areas that are more often than not, just plain 'politically
correct.'"
      - WALL STREET JOURNAL
