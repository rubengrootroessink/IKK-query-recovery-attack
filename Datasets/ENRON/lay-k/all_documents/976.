Dear Ken,

I am conducting a review of Enron for TCW's equity portfolios.  You may 
recall that we have spoken several times when you visited TCW for the Board 
of Directors meetings.  Previously I worked in TCW's Latin America investment 
department and have followed Enron's investments in Latin America.  I am now 
working as an analyst for TCW's equity research department.   With the 
encouragement of Robert Day and Leigh Crawford, whom you met with recently in 
Phoenix, I am considering making a recommendation for the purchase of Enron 
stock.

I am writing to you to solicit your help in setting up a visit to Enron for 
Leigh Crawford and myself.  We are interested in meeting with you, Clifford 
Baxter, Jeffrey Skilling, Andrew Fastow, Mark Koenig, Richard Buy and any 
other individuals you believe would be helpful in our understanding your 
business.  We would also welcome the opportunity to tour Enron's facilities.

The date of the visit can be chosen for the convenience of you and the other 
managers.  The week of December 18th and the early weeks of January are 
particularly convenient for us.

Thank you very much for your help and I look forward to learning more about 
Enron.

Sincerely,
Shannon Callan
Managing Director
TCW
