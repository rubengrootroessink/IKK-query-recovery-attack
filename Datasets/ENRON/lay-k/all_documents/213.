Mr. Lay, I am a 59 1/2 year old employee that last saw you at my 25 year 
award celebration in Houston in 1993.  Since that time, I have had some 
health problems that are leading me to retire a little early from Enron, on 
August 31, 2000. 

 I did not want to leave Enron's active employment until I had the 
opportunity to express to you my gratitude.  I have been with Northern 
Natural Gas, InterNorth, HNG-InterNorth and Enron for thirty two years and 1 
month.  I can tell you without hesitation, that since you took over our 
company in the late 80's, it has been the most challenging and exciting time 
that I have spent in my work life.  I had opportunities that I never dreamt 
of and I am grateful for the opportunities that I have had.   I started on 
August 1, 1968 as a maintenance helper at the South Omaha location of 
Northern Natural Gas.  I was a field technician, an O&M Supervisor, a 
District Manager, and presently the Manager of the Operations Communications 
Center in Omaha.

I have admired and respected you since the first time we met in Des Moines, 
Iowa, shortly after the merger.  Without your guidance and direction and the 
many employee based programs you have initiated, I would not be where I am 
financially today.  I am looking forward to retirement without concern for me 
or my family's future.  The ESOP program was so very important to all of the 
employees, and the many other programs like our "options", variable pay 
(bonus) and others make Enron a leader throughout the world in employee 
satisfaction, and we have the awards to prove it.

The employees that I have worked with in these 32 years are the bright spots 
for Enron, not only in the past but also into the future.  We have done a 
wonderful job of getting the best of the best.

I hope that I will be able to thank you in person and shake your hand once 
more, perhaps at a future shareholders meeting.

Sincerely,

Rod Williams
