Ken, I found your card with your email address  on it when I was sorting 
through 
my filing cabinet. I decided to say  "Hi". Tears still pop in my eyes when I 
think 
about your Dad he was so very special to me. For  my sake I wish he could 
have 
lived forever but for his sake I'm glad he  didn't. I kept working for Kelly 
Assisted Living for a year or more in family  practice clinics etc so I 
wouldn't get too attached
I guess. I then went to work  at Boone Hospital on the cardiology ward for 
about 
6 wks and decided I didn't like that. So I'm now working at a  nursing home 
in 
Salisbury -- and I like this better, other than they are too  short of help 
and I work 
a lot of hours. The old people are still my preference and I  must want to 
get involved 
with them and really know them. But your Dad will always be  the really 
special one.
I just wanted to say hi and thanks for giving me the  opportunity to take 
care of him.
Sincerely, Marilyn Hurt
