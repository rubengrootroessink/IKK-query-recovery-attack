RE:??? June 14 Reception 

Recently Charles Miller and David Dewhurst sent you an invitation 
to a reception which they are hosting on Wed. 6/14 at 5:00 PM to be 
held at the Houston Petroleum Club. 

I hope that you will be able to attend that event. 

Under the leadership of Governor Bush and others we have made real progress 
in Education in Texas over the past decade.? Now it is time to take 
the next steps and achieve even greater progress in our public education 
system. 

The Texas Education Reform Caucus is made up of business leaders, educators, 
and elected officials dedicated to finding common sense approaches to 
improving 
education in Texas. 

I would appreciate the opportunity to visit with you on the 14th. 

Kent Grusendorf 
State Representative District 94
