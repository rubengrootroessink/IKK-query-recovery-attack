<<...>>


Whistler/Blackcomb
British Colombia, Canada
    February 24-28, 2001

Let it Snow, Let it Snow, Let it Snow

....and that's just what it's doing at spectacular Whistler/Blackcomb in
British Colombia, Canada!  The world's top-ranked slopes already boast a
31-inch base with a foot of new powder and 200 open trails!  So dust off
those skis, check out your equipment and pack your bags for the WPO Ski TAG!

Enjoy wonderful days skiing the best slopes with expert guides and
instructors, evening socials in the delightful restaurants at the base of
the mountains peppered with educational sessions including speakers like
Doug Forseth, SVP of Whistler/Blackcomb Operations.  A special evening is
planned for Tuesday the 27th, a celebration of New Orleans' Fat Tuesday!

The best of all worlds is the time spent with family and fellow WPOers
comparing runs, trails, moguls and even the occasional fall.  The rigors of
the day, the friendships of old and new, and the laughter and relaxation of
the evenings are sure to be a highlight of this winter season.
