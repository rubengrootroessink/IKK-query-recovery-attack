The vision is coming into focus and it has a new name!

Over the past several months, the IT Help Desks at Enron Net Works have 
incorporated new processes and methodologies to optimize customer service 
delivery.  As part of this effort, we have implemented a new name - 
Resolution Center.   The following IT Help Desks are included in this 
initiative:

Enron Corporation   3.1411
Enron North America  3.4888
International Offices  6.7757 

For more information, look for our ads on ETV, the posters on the 6th floor 
in 3 Allen Center and in the Lobby of the Enron Building, or visit 
http://itcentral.enron.com. 

To learn more about our new services, come visit members of the Resolution 
Center team in the Enron Building Lobby between 11:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. on 
Tuesday, September 5th.  We look forward to seeing you there!
