Bob,
Wanted to say hello. My trip to Ireland and England
was a blast. Had a good time in both countries. A lot
of history blah, blah, blah. Been with the first
Marines for about two weeks and I am beginning to
figure my way around. Working out every day and
running (on my own) a great deal. Do not want to be
the wimp of the bunch. Should be fun two years with a
lot of training which will culminate with a deployment
to WestPac next year sometime and thats it.

Otherwise thing are good for me. I will be heading bck
to NY for the third week in Sept to attend a wedding
of my HS friend Gary. You probably remember him. Will
be home for a week. First time since I left Med
school. Taking my girlfriend with me back home. She
has already met the Rat in Vegas. She also met Gary
and his bride to be when they came out here for  a
week in the winter.

Hope all is well with you. Any little Bobs in the
future? Stay in touch and I hope the Yankees can hold
on and the Knicks finally unload the old man. Now,
there is no way they can compete with Miami.

Later,
Fran
