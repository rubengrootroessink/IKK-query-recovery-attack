FYI,
We are at a point with the mail server that is going to require me to shut it 
down during the day today and perform hardware upgrades. That is unless 
everyone and I mean everyone goes through their mail and cleans out the sent 
mail, inbox and trash folders. If this is not done soon then mail will stop 
functioning all together.
I would prefer to upgrade the hardware in the evening but this will take 
several hours.

So please help out by cleaning house on your mail, otherwise we will be 
forced to do the upgrade in the middle of the day.

Thanks,
MIke Mc.
