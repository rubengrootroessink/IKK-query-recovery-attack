Can you please grant access to Robert Badeer for TAGG/ERMS.  We need to get him access to TDS and this requires a TAGG login.  Bob will be trading on the NW desk under Mike Grigsby effective Monday March 11th.  Can you please process this request by tomorrow.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.
