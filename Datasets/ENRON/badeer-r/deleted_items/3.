Just a reminder, any of you that are still missing your 2/28 paychecks due =
to postal delays can contact me by e-mail at anthony.jarrett@ubswenergy.com=
 <mailto:anthony.jarrett@ubswenergy.com> and I will request a wire transfer=
 to deposit the funds directly into your accounts.  Earnings statements for=
 those of you that have already had wire transfers processed on 3/4 and 3/5=
 are now available at my desk ECS 05852.  If you request a wire transfer, s=
top payments will be placed on your checks that were sent in the mail. Wire=
 transfers may take as long as 24 hours for your bank to post. If you shoul=
d receive the 2/28 checks by mail, there is no need to return the voided ch=
ecks.  If any of you have issues with late fees, etc. please let us know an=
d we will be working with the Stamford, CT office to reimburse you for any =
losses.    For those of you that have requested wire transfers I will overn=
ight the statements to Chris Calgers attention.

Subject: Missing Paychecks


The checks mailed from Stamford CT, last Monday in some instances where not=
 received by Saturday and we are doing all we can to track these down and w=
ork with the affected employees to help them with any commitments they need=
 to meet. While difficult to substantiate, it appears the late checks appea=
r to be those for employees whose last names begin with an "S-Z" in the alp=
habet. We are hopeful these checks will arrive today, but if you are still =
missing a pay check, even if you have already called or spoken to me this m=
orning, please e-mail me your home address to anthony.jarrett@ubswenergy.co=
m <mailto:anthony.jarrett@ubswenergy.com> so I can verify the address in th=
e system. If you have personal financial circumstances requiring this payme=
nt today please let me know and we will try to work with you on a case by c=
ase basis. We have already requested that paychecks for the 3/15 paydate be=
 Fed Exed to the Houston office to prevent this delay next paydate. I would=
 like to receive all notice's by Noon central time today.

Thanks,=20
