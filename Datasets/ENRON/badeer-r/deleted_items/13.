FYI- I finished granting TDS access for Bob.  login and password will be rbadeer_pc.  Bob - when you get here Monday if you want me to show you how to use and get set up on your machine, let me know.  I am at 3-7376 and sit right below the risk management sign.  I will follow up with EOL now to see what progress is being made there.  Mike - do you want us to change all of the products under Host to Bob and/or add products?  Thanks.

Can you please grant access to Robert Badeer for TAGG/ERMS.  We need to get him access to TDS and this requires a TAGG login.  Bob will be trading on the NW desk under Mike Grigsby effective Monday March 11th.  Can you please process this request by tomorrow.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.
