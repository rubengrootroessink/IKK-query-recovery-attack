Good, you can go from one wet loser state, to a dry hot loser state.

Good luck trading gas. After eating Taco Bell, I usually make enough to
power all of Long Island for a month.

How does a trader earn their keep? you get a commission selling to another
firm or speculate on price movements and take a position?

Let me know when you are in NY, so I can ensure that I am away. 


Good luck in Houston, go Titans!!

Monaco,
	Whats up with you? Great SuperBowl. I hate the Rams, so glad they
lost. I'm going down to Houston to work for UBS on the gas trading desk. New
commodity for me, should be fun. Looking to get back to NY at some point in
the future. I know you'll still be there, stinking up the joint. Anyway,
will let you know how things go. Talk to you soon.

Badeer
