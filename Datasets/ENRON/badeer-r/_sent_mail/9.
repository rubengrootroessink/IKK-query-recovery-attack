> As a result of the delay to 10 minute settlements, members of the SC's
> technical development staff via TSWG have expressed strong concern about
> the short time between the scheduled release of 10 minute settlements and
> adjustable inter-SC trades functionality.   Adjustable inter-SC trades are
> currently scheduled for September 11 release.   The adjustable inter-SC
> trade functionality was identified by Market Participants as a very
> important functionality that should be released ASAP.   Prior to the ISO
> making any final decisiions on propsoed schedule changes rollout of the
> adjustable inter-SC trade functionality, the ISO is seeking additional
> feedback from both the business and technical sides of the Market
> Participants.    Please provide your recommendation and any impact a
> change of scheduled rollout of 2-3 weeks for adjustable inter-SC trades
> would have on your business and systems to Jim Blatchford by Friday,
