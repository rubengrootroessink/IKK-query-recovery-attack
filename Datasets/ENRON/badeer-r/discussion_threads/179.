Netscape 4.74 has been rolled out to the Portland office.  After you've 
completed a fresh login, you will notice Netscape 4.74 on your start menu.  
Just click the Netscape icon and the new version will install automatically.

If you have any problems during this Netscape upgrade, please feel free to 
call any IT person.

Regards,
Paul
