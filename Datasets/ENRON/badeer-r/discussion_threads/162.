UPDATE ON INTER-SC TRADES ADJUSTMENT BID PROJECT TIMELINE
Market Participants:

Market Participants, through TSWG,  have expressed concern about the
currently scheduled release time between 10 minute settlements and Inter-SC
Trade Adjustment Bid functionality.  As a result of the delay to
implementation of 10 minute settlements, the release time frame has
decreased from the original 1 month to approximately 2 weeks.  Understanding
these timing concerns, the ISO has decided to delay the implementation of
Inter-SC Trade Adjustment Bid.

Therefore, the ISO is revising the implementation target date for Inter-SC
Trade Adjustment Bid until the first week of October 1, 2000.  Following is
an updated project timeline.

Prior to the ISO making this decision, feedback from both business and
technical sides of the Market Participants were taken into consideration.
It was determined that this later date will allow Market Participants
additional testing time to prepare for a successful implementation of the
Inter-SC Trade Adjustment Bid software.
