Mary --

Please send out the same information to Western traders.  We would like 
everyone to continue to consider the "shortcomings" of this model.

Christi, please make sure that Mary is kept in the loop on this and Project 
e-trans as much as possible.

Thanks.

Jim

Subject: Enron's transmission/power exchange model for discussion

Attached for comments/discussion is the gov't affairs' draft proposal for an 
Enron model for RTOs.  This includes the flowgate transmission rights model.  
We are also working on a new open access tariff based on this model.  RTO 
proposals are due to FERC 10/15.   Thanks.
