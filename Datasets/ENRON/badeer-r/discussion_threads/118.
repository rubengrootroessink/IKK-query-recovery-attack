  Market Participants:

  On August 1, 2000, the ISO Board of Governors approved a
proposal to conduct a competitive solicitation to procure guaranteed
generation service during natural gas curtailments in the Los Angeles Basin.
Since the service must in place by December 1, 2000, and the ISO expects
this service to be provided by existing generation, the ISO needs to have
responses by October 6, 2000.  ISO staff is preparing the materials for the
solicitation and expects to release those materials in the next few weeks.
We expect final approval of a response by the Board of Governors during the
week of October 23, 2000.

  This note will allow potential respondents to begin
preparing your response in advance of the release of the solicitation.

  The Board memo and presentation regarding this solicitation,
which include the proposed principles of the solicitation, can be found at

<http://www.caiso.com/docs/2000/07/27/2000072714421515747.html> .

  We will notify you again when the materials are ready.  If
you have any questions, please contact Brian Theaker at (916) 608-5804, or
