Dear All, 

I have heard from several of you today that we continue to receive Broker 
Confirms which reference "WSPP Schedule C" instead of "CAISO Energy" for 
deals done at California Delivery Points.  I have spoken with Bob Badeer and 
he promised me that he and Jeff are going to call them as soon as they can. 

In the meantime, if for any SP15, NP15, or Z26 deals we receive a Broker 
Confirmation with  "WSPP Schedule C" instead of "CAISO Energy", please mark 
out the former by hand and replace it with the latter. Then fax the amended 
Confirmation back to the Broker and say something in the fax Cover Sheet to 
the effect of :

"We have amended the attached Confirmation(s) to show that the relevant 
energy purchased/sold is "CAISO Energy". Please revise your Confirmation(s) 
to reflect this modification and send the amended Confirmation(s) to us and 
our Counterparty. Should you have any questions with regard to the "CAISO 
Energy" product, please contact Bob Badeer on (503) 464-3926 or Jeff Richter 
on (503) 464-3720."

Let's give Bob and Jeff some time to call the brokers and I would propose to 
reassess the situation next Monday (I am out of the office on business on 
Friday). Let's see where we are then.

Thanks everyone, 

Shari

Bob & Jeff, 

At my request, the Confirm Desk has put together a list of Brokers who 
continue to reference " West Firm" rather than "CAISO" in their Broker 
Confirmations for deals done at the California Delivery Points.  Please see 
Kim's email below. 

Could you please speak with each of them and reiterate that they must 
specifically reference "CAISO" energy in their Confirmations if that is the 
product we told them that we would buy or sell? 

Bob- I will call you later on this afternoon about Pacificorp. We got 2 more 
Confirms today with "CAISO" stricken through.

Thanks in advance guys,
