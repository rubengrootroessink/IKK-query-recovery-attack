Recently, there have been several questions regarding Enron's fitness club 
reimbursement policy.  I want to take this opportunity to advise you of the 
revised policy as well as make you aware of a corporate membership rate which 
has been established with the RiverPlace Athletic Club.

Enron will reimburse the following fees for membership at any fitness 
facility:

up to a maximum of $100 for membership fees
up to $25 per month for dues

A corporate membership with RiverPlace Athletic Club has been established for 
anyone interested in joining.  If you would like to try out the facility 
prior to joining, RiverPlace is offering a 5 day guest pass.  Please speak 
with Joanie Schlecter regarding the pass or to enroll.  

The fees are as follows:

Individual   Couple/Family
$200 membership  $300 membership
$73/month for dues  $116/month for dues

When you enroll, please specify that you work for  Enron North America.  
RiverPlace will bill Enron directly for your monthly dues and we will submit 
to have your dues reimbursed through payroll deduction each pay period.  

If you have any questions regarding the fitness club reimbursement policy, 
please do not hesitate to ask either me or Teri Whitcomb.

Kind regards -
Amy
