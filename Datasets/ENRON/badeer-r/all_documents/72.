 DJ US Northwest Pwr Forwards Higher On Water; SW 3Q Up

 NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Forward prices for electricity in the northwest U.S.
rose
 Thursday on concerns about hydroelectric supplies in the region, traders
said.

 Hydroelectric dam reservoirs are low in the Northwest due to a lack of rain
the past
 several weeks. River flows have been even lower than forecast this week,
and
 hydroelectric generators have been run as much as possible to make up for
reductions
 in supply from the Colstrip generating station in Montana. Transmission
lines from the
 station had to be turned off several times over the past two weeks due to
forest fires in
 the state.

 "All the generators on the Columbia River right now are sucking mud," one
northwest
 utility prescheduler said Thursday.

 Southwest prompt forwards were flat Thursday, but third quarter 2001
contracts started
 racing higher late in the day. Traders said that Enron Corp. is a big
buyer. The market
 rumor is that the California Independent System Operator is in the market
for 3,000
 megawatts of supply for next summer.

 California-Oregon Border contracts for September traded Thursday at
$197-$205 per
 megawatt-hour, compared with Wednesday's range of $181-$190/MWh.

 October COB traded at $139-$145/MWh, compared with $126-$129/MWh Wednesday.


 September Palo Verde contracts traded at $175-$178/MWh, unchanged.
Third-quarter
 2001 Palo Verde traded at $182-$200/MWh Thursday, compared with
$175-$177/MWh
 Wednesday.
