 DJ US Sen. Feinstein Urges Cap For Western US Power Market

 NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--U.S. Senator Diane Feinstein, D-Calif., on Wednesday
urged
 the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to place a regionwide cap on
wholesale
 electricity rates for the western United States.

 To date, a price cap of $250 per megawatt-hour has been placed only on
California's
 power market. A regional cap is necessary to avoid "electricity bidding
wars" between
 western states during power shortages that could result in blackouts in
California,
 Feinstein said.

 "As is clearly evident, the energy market in San Diego is not functioning,
at this time,
 as a true market," Feinstein said in a letter to FERC Chairman James J.
Hoecker. "The
 lack of energy generation has produced a dramatic increase in electricity
prices with
 many families and businesses facing energy bills two or three times higher
than normal
 and has led to the possibility of wholesale price gouging."

 Feinstein also supported President Clinton's use Wednesday of $2.6 million
in
 emergency energy assistance funds for low income households, and special
credit
 programs for small businesses.
