Dear CA OSS and WSCC OTCPG members,

 Attached is the Path 26 study report which supports moving the
thermally limited OTC from 2800 MW to 3000 MW.  The COI/PDCI and SCIT
nomogram remain unchanged. The CAISO has scheduled a conference call this
Friday to discuss this report and seek OSS and WSCC OTC PG review and
approval.  I know this is short notice for most of you.  In the interest are
reliability and full utilization of the system,  I thank you all in advance
for supporting the expedited review of this report.

If you have any questions or comments on the report please E-Mail  Chuck Wu
at Cywu@caiso.com <mailto:Cywu@caiso.com>  and CC me at Elim@smud.org
<mailto:Elim@smud.org> .

SEC at WSCC please post and distribute accordingly.

Talk to you this Friday!
