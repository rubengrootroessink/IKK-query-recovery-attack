>    On February 29, 2000, the ISO issued a Market Notice
> for the "Summer 2000 Market Participating Load Trial Program" soliciting
> participation in the ISO's Ancillary Services and Supplemental Energy
> markets by additional Participating Loads.  The ISO proposed to
> accommodate such participation from June 15 to October 15, 2000 by Loads
> that could provide telemetry of their Demand data to the ISO's Energy
> Management System pursuant to a "relaxed" Technical Standard.  The ISO
> indicated that it would accept proposals for up to the following amounts
> of capacity for bidding in the specified markets:
>
>      Non-Spinning Reserve:   400 MW
>      Replacement Reserve:   400 MW
>      Supplemental Energy: 1,000 MW
>
>    In response to that solicitation, the ISO received
> several proposals and has been working to implement participation by the
> respondents.  In the course of the implementation process, the ISO has
> determined that the actual amounts of capacity that will potentially be
> available to participate will be below the maximum for any of the listed
> services.  Approximately half of the 400 MW in Non-Spin and Replacement
> has been committed (some subject to CPUC approval) leaving approximately
> 200 MW available in each category.  Approximately 750 MW is still
> available in the Supplemental Energy category.
>
>    Therefore, the ISO wishes to announce a re-opening
> of the period for submittal of proposals for the "Summer 2000 Market
> Participating Load Trial Program"  The ISO seeks to obtain the total
> amount of participation requested for the trial program within the time
> available.  At this time the ISO plans to leave this solicitation open
> until the maximum capacities are reached as noted above.  Also it should
> be noted that while the solicitation will be open until the requested
> capacities are reached,  the current timeframe of the Summer 2000 Trial
> Program and the applicability of the "relaxed" Technical Standards runs
> only through October 15, 2000.  At this time the ISO expects to continue
> this Load Program beyond October 15, 2000, however a final decision on
> continuation and the exact technical and commercial details applicable to
> any such continuation will be reached late this year based on a review of
> the Summer 2000 Program experience.
>
>
>    Additional respondents should follow the process and
> requirements set forth in the February 29, 2000 Market Notice in all
> respects other than the date for delivery of proposals.  This can be
> located on the ISO Home Page at  http://www.caiso.com/clientserv/load/ .
> or by navigating from Client Services to Stakeholder Processes to
> Participating Loads.  There are 4 documents listed under the Feb 29
> posting entitled " Formal Invitation for the Summer 2000 Load
> Participation in the ISO Ancillary  Service and Supplemental Energy
> Markets. "
