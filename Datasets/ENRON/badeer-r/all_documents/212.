Bob:

I cannot make this stuff up.  Steve Peace, the Senator famous for his
fight to protect the California Rate Payers, came to fame as the writer
of the Critically aclaimed film, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes.  I
didn't believe it either until someone sent me this web page, with his
link attached to it.

This page is dedicated to the three demented geniuses who brought us the 
Killer Tomatoes films!

?

John DeBello - Director/Writer

John DeBello was the director of all four Killer Tomatoes films. He also 
played small roles in each film, even playing himself in a few! He still runs 
many parts of Four Square Productions, I'm told.

Steve Peace - Writer/Actor

Steve Peace is probably best known in the KT films as Wilbur, the dim-witted, 
parachute-wearing leader of the Killer Tomatoes Task force. He also wrote 
parts of the films as well. Now, he's a state Senator, and even has his own 
page at http://www.stevepeace.net

Costa Dillon - Writer

Last, but definitley not least is Costa Dillon. He's responsible for the 
entire concept of Killer Tomatoes! Like everyone else here, he played small 
parts throughout the films. Probably his best known was the kid in the 
library in the original film, who cleared out the room by merely saying 
"Tomato!". This little part was later used as a major character in the 
cartoon series.
