PRESENTATIONS THAT WORK
   August 29 & 30 in EB560

     Does your job include preparing and delivering presentations? . . . . .

This course focuses on instruction and practice in organization, delivery 
skills, design tips and use of visuals effectively (powerpoint and overhead), 
and question-and-answer models.  Participants will receive personalized, 
confidential feedback from the instructor and will develop a self-improvement 
action plan.  Customized exercises give participants first-hand experience in 
one-on-one, small groups, impromptu, and sit-down settings.
