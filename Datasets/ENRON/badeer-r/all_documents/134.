Subject: ISO Special 8.10.00 Report on Energy Market Issues and Performance: 
May-June, 2000

FYI.  The ISO Dept. of Market Analysis Released a rather hefty "special 
report" yesterday.  The URL is attached.
Among other things, it concludes that, despite the lack of generation 
concentration
in California, market power in times of shortage has been partially 
responsible for the price spikes.

"The observed market power was the combined effect of the bidding activity of 
in-state and out-of-state generation sources....
The high prices bid by out-of-state suppliers as well as the high prices 
quoted to ISO's out-of-market calls are indications of 
the market power of out-of-state suppliers"...[A]t high load conditions, even 
suppliers with less than a 9% market share can 
have significant market power."
