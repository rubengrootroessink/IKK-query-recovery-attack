Market Participants and Scheduling Coordinators:

The ISO has posted the CPUC subpoena on its website at
http://www.caiso.com/docs/2000/07/26/2000072610262610454.pdf
<http://www.caiso.com/docs/2000/07/26/2000072610262610454.pdf>   As stated
in a message forwarded yesterday to market participants and scheduling
coordinators, the CPUC has agreed to extend the deadline for a reply to
Friday July 28, although the ISO has been informed today that the extension
is only until NOON on Friday.  In addition, the ISO discussed the reference
to an affidavit in the subpoena with the CPUC and was informed that this
results from a typo which will be corrected in a corrected document sent by
federal express to the ISO yesterday (the words attached affidavit will be
replaced with the word attachments).  The ISO has accepted federal express
service of the subpoena.

The ISO has raised confidentiality concerns with the CPUC and the CPUC
agreed to circulate a draft of a confidentiality agreement to the ISO today.
The ISO will forward the draft to market participants and scheduling
coordinators as soon as we receive it.  Once again the ISO reiterates to
market participants that to the extent they have outstanding issues as to
the subpoena, these should be raised directly with the appropriate entity.
The ISO intends to comply with the subpoena on Friday unless it receives a
legally sufficient communication to the contrary from the CPUC or a court.

Finally, a few market participants have requested that the ISO make
available several letters forwarded to the EOB discussing confidential
treatment.  These letters are attached.

Questions should be directed to Jeanne M. Sol, at 916-608-7144.

Regulatory Counsel
