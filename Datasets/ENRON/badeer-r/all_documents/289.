Market Participants:

> PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) is planning to commence the 2000 Operational
> Study in July 2000.  As in past years, PwC is seeking input from market
> participants prior to recommending the specific procedures to be covered
> in this Operational Study.  The Audit Committee will make the final
> decision on the scope of the Study based on recommendations from PwC,
> which will reflect input from this stakeholder feedback process.
>
> Please call or e-mail Charlotte Martin at (916) 351-2118 /
> cmartin@caiso.com to request a meeting (in person or via conference call)
> with PwC to discuss the scope of this study.
>
> As described at the May Audit Committee meeting, market participants will
> be given the opportunity to have a member of Operations management, Trent
> Carlson, present during all or a portion of the meetings.  At its recent
> meeting, the Audit Committee reaffirmed its position that information
> conveyed during these meetings is to be treated in the strictest
> confidence when the market participants so desire.
>
> When making arrangements for the meeting please advise Charlotte which of
> the three choices you desire:
>  1)  Meet with PwC only
>  2)  Meet with PwC and Trent Carlson
>  3)  Meet first with PwC only; followed by a session including Trent
> Carlson to cover certain matters addressed in the first meeting that the
> market participant wish to communicate directly to CAISO management.
