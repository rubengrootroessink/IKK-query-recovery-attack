 DJ Clinton To Direct Govt To Help Calif On Electricity Woes

 WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--U.S. President Bill Clinton will direct federal
agencies
 Wednesday to provide financial assistance to low-income families and small
 businesses in Southern California to help them cope with high electricity
bills, the White
 House said in a written statement.

 Clinton also ordered the release of $2.6 million from the Low Income Home
Energy
 Assistance Program to help low-income families in Southern California. The
Small
 Business Administration will urge its lending partners to use SBA credit
programs to
 help small businesses with their energy costs.

 Clinton is taking the action because of a steep rise in the wholesale price
of electricity,
 the statement said.

 In addition, Clinton has called on Energy Secretary Bill Richardson to ask
the Federal
 Energy Regulatory Commission to speed up an investigation into the bulk
market for
 electricity "so that state and federal regulators and policy makers can
have the
 information they need to protect consumers in a timely fashion."

 Clinton's actions marks the second time this summer the president has
stepped in to
 help California cope with its electricity shortages. Earlier, Clinton
called on all federal
 facilities in California to cut their power usage and to direct power back
into the
 electricity grid.
