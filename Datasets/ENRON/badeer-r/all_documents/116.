Tim/Bob:

Attached is the letter that we sent to Lynch explaining the info we thought 
ought to be made publicly available.  We're discussing how we can ensure that 
the market has access to any and all information that FERC might use in its 
"investigation" so that independent analyses might be undertaken.  Is there 
anything in addition to the information we included in the letter to Lynch 
(or that is already be publicly available) that FERC might use in its 
investigation and that we ought to target for public release?  Thanks alot.

Best,
Jeff

We need to come up (very quickly) with a strategy on how to get the market 
information that will be important for FERC Investigation into the public 
arena.

I keep thinking that FERC can require the information and somehow get it made 
public right away.  

1. What information is not public that would be helpful?

2. What strategy will work to get FERC to take action?

Jim
