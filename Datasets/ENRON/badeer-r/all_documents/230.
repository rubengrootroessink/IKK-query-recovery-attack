The CA ISO is in receipt of a request for information from the California
Electricity Oversight Board (EOB). The information requested is listed in

The CA ISO is in the process of determining and compiling it's response to
the request.

This notice is provided in accordance with section 20.3.4 of the ISO tariff
which states:

 Notwithstanding anything in this Section 20.3 to the contrary, if
the ISO is required by applicable laws or regulations, or in the course of
administrative or judicial proceedings, to disclose information that is
otherwise required to be maintained in confidence pursuant to this Section
2.3, the ISO may disclose such information; provided, however, that as soon
as the ISO learns of the disclosure requirement and prior to making such
disclosure, the ISO shall notify any affected Market Participant of the
requirement and the terms thereof. The Market Participant may, at its sole
discretion and own cost, direct any challenge to or defense against the
disclosure requirement and the ISO shall cooperate with such affected Market
Participant to the maximum extent practicable to minimize the disclosure of
the information consistent with applicable law. The ISO shall cooperate with
the affected Market Participant to obtain proprietary or confidential
treatment of confidential information by the person to whom such information
is disclosed prior to such disclosure.

The ISO requests any Market Participant who intends to take action to
challenge or defend against the disclosure of information to notify the ISO
as soon as possible by contacting Jeanne M. Sol, at (916) 608-1744, email
<mailto:jsole@caiso.com> jsole@caiso.com. The ISO intends to release the
information no later than Monday, July 10.
