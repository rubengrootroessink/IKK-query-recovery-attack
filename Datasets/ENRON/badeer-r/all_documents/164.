Both SCE and PG&E have been authorized to purchase energy, capacity, and 
ancillary services through bilateral contracts.
Quantities are limited to previously authorized limits in the forward market 
(the PX Block Forward Markets)
The contracts must expire on or before 12/31/05.
For both PG&E and SCE, these contracts will be subject to limited 
reasonableness review.
PG&E will not be allowed to enter into such contracts after the transition 
period ends (3/31/02). The Commission will continue e to oversee the 
procurement practices on a quarterly basis. 
This was an emergency motion, so it is reasonable to assume that both PG&E 
and SCE can enter into such transactions immediately.

SDG&E is authorized to enter into bids for 6*16 delivery period or a 7*24 
delivery period for terms of 8/00 through 12/00 or 8/00 through 3/01. 
SDG&E will submit bids to buy energy a levelized price for both terms.
SDG&E will bid only for small commercial and residential customers under 20kW
The quantities are limited to the quantities that they had approved in the 
BFM participation spelled out in advice letter 1234-E. I do not have a copy 
of that advice letter off hand but will provide you with the information 
tomorrow.

We will provide you with more details soon.

If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me.

Attached are the decision related to the above issues.
