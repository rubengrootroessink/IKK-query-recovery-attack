With more power in the possession of fewer companies, the amount of
generating capacity a big utility needs to compete in the marketplace is
rising.  Find out just how many tens of thousands of megawatts constitutes
"big" these days, including a list of the biggest, at

exchanges could save utilities millions of dollars in procurement and

+High Cost of Oil and Natural Gas Puts FPL $518 Million Behind in Fuel
Expense Recovery

Faced with skyrocketing oil and natural gas prices and heavy seasonal demand
for electricity, Florida Power & Light Company has filed preliminary
paperwork with the Florida Public Service Commission identifying $518
million in expenses above projections for fuel burned to produce electricity
in 2000. FPL will file with the Commission in September for permission to
recover the expense in customer bills beginning Jan. 1, 2001.

Part of this increase will be offset by a refund to customers that is
currently estimated to be $75 million to $100 million. The refund is
pursuant to an agreement reached in April 1999 with the Office of the Public
Counsel and the FPSC that provides for revenue sharing between FPL and its
customers, as well as a 6% annual rate reduction for three years. As a
result of the forecasted fuel costs and the expected rebate, residential
electric rates could increase by approximately 13% per kilowatt-hour.

The cost of oil used to generate electricity has more than doubled since the
first quarter of 1999 and has not been this high since the Gulf War in 1990.
Since January 2000, oil prices have increased 44% per barrel. Natural gas
prices also have risen unabated, climbing 77% since January 2000. With the
onset of winter, natural gas prices may increase further as demand for
heating fuel increases.
