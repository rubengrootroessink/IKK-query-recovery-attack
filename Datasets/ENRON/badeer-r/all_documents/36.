I regret to announce that Tom Krueger is resigning from Enron North America 
to pursue real estate development.  Tom has over 18 years with Enron and 
Portland General and we sincerely appreciate his contributions to our 
company.  Tom's last day will be September 8 so stay tuned for details on his 
farewell party!  Please join me in thanking Tom and wishing him the best of 
luck.

Chris
