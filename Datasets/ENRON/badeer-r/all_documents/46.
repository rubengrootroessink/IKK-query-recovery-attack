Big Bob,

Writing to say hello. I returned to the states three
weeks ago and have been working at Camp Horno with the
1/1 since that time. It has been about three weeks.
The job is actually pretty good. I run the sick call
for the unit and do someother admin type things. Other
than that my time is pretty much my own. No call over
nifgt every third night at the hospital or some
asshole doctor chewing your ass about taking care of
patients. I still feel kind of out of the loop with
the other Marine officers but something tells me that
probably will not change. Likely, they look at me like
the friendly and tolerable neighborhood nerd who is
there to take care of the troops and give people light
duty chits. At least they leave me alone and give me a
chance to work out. The hills around Camp P are brutal
and unforgiving. I hope to be in good enough condition
in two-three more weeks to start running up the bigger
ones in the morning.
   That is about it. Wanted to say hello and defend
and deflect any artillery shells you and rat are
lobbing against me behind my back!!!!
