News Briefs:

+Montana Power Sells Oil and Gas Business Unit
The Montana Power Co. has sold for $475million (US) its nonregulated oil and
gas business unit to PanCanadian Petroleum Limited of Calgary. The sale
includes subsidiaries that have interests in crude oil, natural gas and gas
liquids exploration, production and marketing in the U.S. and Canada.

Proceeds from the sale would be invested in growing Touch America, MPC's
national fiber-optic and wireless broadband telecommunications subsidiary.
The U.S. businesses have operations in northern Montana and in the D-J
(Denver-Julesburg) Basin north of Denver as well as minor properties in the
Anadarko Basin, Oklahoma, and Green River Basin, Wyoming. Fractionation
plants are at Cut Bank, MT, and Ft. Lupton, CO. The Canadian properties
reside mostly in southern and central Alberta and in southern Saskatchewan.

+Deutsche Telekom to Buy Powertel for $5.89bn
The Financial Times said that Deutsche Telekom is expanding in the U.S.
mobile phone market by acquiring Powertel, a local mobile operator in the
Southeast, for about $5.89 billion in shares. The deal comes just weeks
after DT moved into the U.S. mobile market through the $50 billion
acquisition of VoiceStream.

As that deal has not yet been completed, the latest transaction is
structured as an all-share acquisition of Powertel by Voicestream. The two
U.S. companies have also agreed that the deal will go ahead even if DT's
takeover of VoiceStream is not completed.

Communications Holdings, Inc., a unit of SCANA Corp., owns approximately
14.6 million fully diluted
common shares, or about a 27% equity interest, in Powertel, representing an
investment of $249 million.
