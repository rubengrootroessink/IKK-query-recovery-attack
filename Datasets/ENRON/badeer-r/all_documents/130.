As Enron employees, we are responsible for conducting the business affairs =

the Company in accordance with all applicable laws and in a moral and hones=
t=20
manner.

To make certain that we understand what is expected of us, Enron has adopte=
d=20
certain policies, approved by the Board of Directors, which are in the Code=
=20
of Ethics July 2000, formerly known as the Enron Conduct of Business=20
Affairs.  This year, we=01,ve made some revisions to our Code of Ethics to=
=20
address recent policies approved by the Board of Directors and adopted by=
=20
Enron.  These changes include: =20

=01  Principles of Human Rights have been added, which describe Enron=01,s=

The Code of Ethics contains commonsense rules of conduct that most employee=

practice on a day-to-day basis.  However, I ask that you read them carefull=

=20
It is absolutely essential that you fully comply with these policies in the=
=20
future.  If you have any questions, I encourage you to discuss them with yo=
ur=20
supervisor or Enron legal counsel.

d=20
