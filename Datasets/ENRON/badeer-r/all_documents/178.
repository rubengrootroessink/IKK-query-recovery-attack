  Market Participants:

  After yesterday's announcement of CMR stakeholder meeting
schedule changes, we learned of a conflict with previously-scheduled
meetings on August 15 that affected many of you who have been active in the
CMR process.  As a result, we have rescheduled the stakeholder meetings to
discuss details of the CMR Recommendation for August 16-18.  We give you
specifics of these meetings as soon as they are available.

  Byron Woertz
  Director, Client Relations
