We recently installed two new digital copiers in the break room.  For the 
most part, they are very user friendly, and I have been able to make 
different types of copy jobs without any training at all.  However, we have 
the capability to provide formal training with a Xerox representative on a 
prescheduled basis.  

A training session, which can accommodate five people for training, is 
scheduled for Thursday at 9:30 a.m.  The training takes an hour and a half.  
If more than five individuals request training on Thursday, I will schedule 
another training session at a later date.

For your information, if you are not interested in formal training there is 
an instructional CD that you can borrow to learn about the features of the 
equipment, and there is a manual you can borrow if you would like to borrow 
it for instructional purposes.

Please contact me if you are interested in attending Xerox training on 
Thursday at 9:30 a.m. or if you would be interested in training at another 
time, and I will coordinate these training efforts.

Let me know if you have any questions.
