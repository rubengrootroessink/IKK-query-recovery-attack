News Brief:
+TXU Europe puts gas assets up for sale
FT Energy's Gas Daily Europe reports that TXU Europe is putting its North
Sea gas assets up for sale. The utility confirmed today that is in
"preliminary talks" with a number of third parties, but stressed it was
"very early days". The move follows "a number of unsolicited expressions of
interests" in the business, including its operatorship. TXU said it is
reviewing this part of its business and will only decide whether to sell at
its conclusion. It has not set a deadline for the review.

A source inside the company was not surprised at the review: "The business
has changed a lot in the last year." TXU has already put up its UK
generation assets for sale, and this latest move to divest gas assets could
mark a shift in strategy to focus on trading and retailing. Some analysts
believe that assets no longer give "competitive advantage" to energy
companies, as the focus shifts towards the end-user and convergence of gas
and electricity.

TXU's principal production assets comprise the operating licence and 64.2%
of the 83bn ft? Johnston gas field, plus 14.75% of the 33bn ft? Ravenspurn
North field, 11.24% of the 5bn ft? Welland field and 4.83% of the 17bn ft?
Schooner field. It also has a number of upstream exploration licences and
interests in pipelines.
