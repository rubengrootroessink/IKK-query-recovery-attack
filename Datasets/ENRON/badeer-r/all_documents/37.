We have had some confusion recently with respect to coverage when someone is 
out of the office.  From here forward, please provide the following 
information to me via e-mail for days when you are out of the office:

Curve coverage - who is responsible for ensuring that your curves are updated 
and downloaded in an accurate and timely manner.
EOL coverage - which products need to be maintained and who will make the 
markets in your absence.

This new procedure is effective immediately!
