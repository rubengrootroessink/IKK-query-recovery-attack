  Market Participants,

  The California ISO is conducting an Internet site usability
study to determine how we can improve our Internet site. Toward this end, we
have contracted with Carta, Inc. to conduct a site study and recommend
revisions for the site. Stakeholder involvement is an important part of this
process.  We have prepared a Web Site Usability Survey as a part of this
effort. This survey is on-line at our site.

  Please take a few minutes to fill out the survey at
http://www.caiso.com/contact/survey.html
<http://www.caiso.com/contact/survey.html> . Your feedback is vital to the
success of this program. Responses will be sent directly to Carta for review
and tabulation.

  Please note, this project does not involve the OASIS section
of our site. The OASIS redesign project is a separate effort. See
http://www.caiso.com/clientserv/xml/ <http://www.caiso.com/clientserv/xml/>
for information on the OASIS redesign effort.

  If you have any questions, please contact the ISO Webmaster.
Thank you for your continued support.
