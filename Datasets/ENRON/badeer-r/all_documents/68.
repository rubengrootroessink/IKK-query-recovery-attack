The new version of the EnronOnline website is almost ready for launch. This 
new version includes a new look and feel and new functionality designed to 
bring more information to our customers and to provide new ways to transact 
with Enron.

We will soon be sending you an email announcing the specific launch date for 
Phase 2 of EnronOnline. In the meantime, we have prepared a series of 
presentations and training sessions designed to help you become familiar with
