  Market Participants:

  At the June 8 Congestion Reform Stakeholder meeting, we
discussed the possibility of a meeting on June 20 to address locational
market power mitigation.  We will not hold such a meeting on June 20th.
However, we  are working on a comprehensive project schedule and plan to
have it to you by the end of this week. That schedule should cover meetings
on Congestion Management for June, July, August and early September.
