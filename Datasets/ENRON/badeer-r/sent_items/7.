Paul,
=09I hope this is the right address. I ran into Kristian and Monica the oth=
er day, got Kristian's card, and promptly lost it. I am going solely on my =
formidable memory of the address. Sounds like you guys had a bigger freak s=
how there than we did here. What an incredible story. Hopefully neither of =
us will have to go through that again. I'm out of the office here and headi=
ng down to Houston to trade gas. It's west basis, so I should be able to dr=
aw on my power knowledge a little bit. Things got a little crazy here, will=
 have to tell you more over several beers, I think that is the minimum it w=
ill take. Erica is excited for a change, although Houston is not her first =
choice, she's a trooper and will find fun things to do. How is Sarah doing?=
 I hope she and the baby have made it through all the changes. There is a w=
oman here who I think would be interested in coming to London. She is young=
 (only 23) but has raw talent. She started here last summer working in the =
California book. Let me know if you could use a hand, as I said, she has ra=
w talent and drive. Thats all from here. Stay in touch and say hello to Sar=
ah.=20

Bob
