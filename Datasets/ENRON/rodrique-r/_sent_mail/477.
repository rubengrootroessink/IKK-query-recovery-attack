> A married man left work early one Friday afternoon.
> Instead of going home, he squandered the weekend and his

> When he finally returned home on Sunday night, he ran into
> a furious wife.  After a couple of hours of yelling and
> screaming his wife asked, "How would you like it if you
> didn't see me for a couple of days?" He responded, "That

> So, Monday went by, and the man didn't see his wife.
> Tuesday and Wednesday came and went with the same result.
> By Thursday, the swelling went down enough so that he
> could see her a little... just out of the corner of his
