Robin,

You will be receiving a cost-of-living adjustment of 20% when you relocate to 
Chicago plus an additional $1,000 per month.  In addition, we will provide 
relocation assistance for your household goods and car transportation.  

Allowance
$3,500 will cover expenses which are outside the movement of your household 
goods.  (This amount is before taxes.)

Household goods move
Option 1 - Full service of household goods
Option 2 - Self move / $1,500  (This amount is before taxes.)


Please let me know if you need additional information.

Thanks,
Ivonne Brown
