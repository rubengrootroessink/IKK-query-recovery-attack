Subject: Enron ends exclusive agreement with Blockbuster

As you are aware, Enron signed an agreement with Blockbuster Inc. last summer 
to launch an entertainment on-demand service.  We announced today that we are 
discontinuing our exclusive relationship with Blockbuster in order to expand 
the offering by developing direct relationships with content providers and 
distribution partners.

We have made tremendous progress toward our goal of becoming the leading 
provider of entertainment on-demand over a digital platform.  We rolled out 
the trial service in Seattle, Portland, Salt Lake City and New York in 
December, and today subscribers are buying movies on-demand using the service 
we created.

However, the exclusive relationship with Blockbuster has not yielded the 
quantity and quality of movies needed to drive demand for this exciting, new 
on-demand service.  Now that we have proven the concept, we want to take our 
service to the next level by adding content and subscribers on an accelerated 
basis.  We feel that this can be best achieved by pursuing entertainment 
on-demand independently.

We intend to initiate discussions with various content providers for 
delivering their content over the Enron platform.  We remain very positive 
about the potential of this business for EBS and Enron and will keep you 
apprised of our progress.
