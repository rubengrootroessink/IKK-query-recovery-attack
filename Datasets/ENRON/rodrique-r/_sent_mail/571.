You got her a $100 gift certificate to Talbot's (a women's clothing store).  
You did a very good job picking it out.  

Thanks for the golf clubs by the way.  I thought you weren't going to send 
them, so I was surprised when Karon told me she had them.  I'll hold them for 
ransom until I get paid back for the birthdays!!  I actually went to the 
driving range this weekend.  I definitely think I could get hooked on this 
sport.  Hopefully I won't become one of the "golf junkies" but I'm not sure 
you can avoid it.  I was watching a golf infomercial the other day thinking 
"I need that!"  

Well back to work.  Did I tell you I'm working daylight hours again?

Talk to ya later,
Robin
