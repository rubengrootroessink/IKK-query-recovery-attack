Jon,

Attached you will find a copy of the basis positions as reported to John 
Lavorato for November 17.  The positions listed represent the entire Canadian 
office position at each point.  The attached includes only those points that 
John Lavorato has requested be reported by trader, not every point at which 
you have positions.




If you have any questions please let me know.
