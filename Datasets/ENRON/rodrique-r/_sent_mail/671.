Hey guys,

Here are your positions for tonight.  We are off on FT CAN, but remember I 
included the Exotics text file in that position.  I am also attaching IM 
Canada.  

Please let me know how it looks as soon as possible so we can resolve 
variances before the system is shut down.

Thanks,
Robin
