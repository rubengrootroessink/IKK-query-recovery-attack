You don't have me beat.  We have them delivered at least a couple times a 
year.  The first time I saw the lobby filled with Krispy Kreme's I thought I 
must have died and that was heaven.  They were handing out boxes to people as 
they got of the elevators.  If they did that everyday I would be more excited 
to get here. of course then I'd have to take the freight elevator b/c 
anything else would be too small.  I got to work at 3:45 this morning, so I'm 
actually going to leave pretty soon.  Unfortunately I'll be back later.  One 
of our people is on vacation so I'm covering the night shift tonight.  So it 
should be a nice 20 hour day today. 

I'm going Christmas shopping this weekend, so let me know if you still need 
something for mom.  Not that I have any great ideas, but I'm hoping I can 
find her some clothes.  If all else fails I'll get her blue earrings!!  I'm 
tempted to find somewhere where I can buy blue and red earrings in bulk and 
give her a couple dozen pairs of each.  

Are you watching CNN right now?  One of the protestors is holding a sign that 
has Gore's name written with the communist sickle as the G.  It's pretty 
funny.  I also like the Sore Loserman signs.  

Enjoy a doughnut for me.
Robin
