Please confirm...I'm still confused.  So you're coming, right?  You would 
have fun if you come.  Becky always tells stories about either her family or 
her husbands.  Since her family is from the hills of West Virginia and her 
husbands is from the swamps of Louisiana, she always has funny stories.


Let me know if you change your mind.
