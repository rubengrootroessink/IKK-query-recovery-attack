I just wanted to let you know that the INTRA-TEXAS-GDL booked pulled in a 
July fixed price gas daily position last night.  Maybe you could apply the 
same logic that is used to pull this position to the Gas Daily books that are 
not currently pulling in the fixed price gas daily positions.  The books that 
had fixed price position for 6/26 that did not pull in are listed below.  

BOOK ID  POST ID  JULY FIXED PRICE POSITION(in contracts)

GD-MARKET-GDL 819207   92.9

GD-CENTRAL-GDL 819212   263.3

GD-TEXAS-GDL 819657   (15.5)

If there is any more information that will help you develop the correct logic 
please let me know.

Thanks,
Robin
