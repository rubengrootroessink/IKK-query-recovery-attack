>  A woman and a man are involved in a car
>  accident; it's a bad one.
>  Both of their cars are totally demolished but amazingly
>  neither of them are hurt.
>  After they crawl out of their cars, the woman says, "So
>  you're a man; that's interesting.  I'm a woman.
>  Wow, just look at our cars!  There's nothing left, but
>  fortunately we are unhurt.  This must be a sign from God
>  that we should meet and be friends
>  and live together in peace for the rest of our
>  days."
>
>  Flattered, the man replied, "Oh yes, I agree
>  with you completely!
>  This must be a sign from God!"
> The woman continued, "And
>  look at this, here's another
>  miracle.  My car is completely demolished but
>  this bottle of wine didn't break.
>  Surely God wants us to drink this wine and
>  celebrate our good fortune."
>
>  Then she hands the bottle to the man.  The man
>  nods his head in agreement, opens
>  it and drinks half the bottle and then hands it
>  back to the woman. The woman
>  takes the bottle, immediately puts the cap back
>  on, and hands it back to the man.
>
>  The man asks, "Aren't you having any?"  The
>  woman replies, "No.  I  think  I'll
>  just wait for the police..."
>
>  Moral of the story:
>  Women are clever bitches.  Don't mess with
