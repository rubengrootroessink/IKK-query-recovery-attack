Canada officializes one calc that includes both their price and basis 
positions.  Risktrac only recognizes the book id to which it assigns the post 
id.  Since the Canada post id includes two books ids,  we manually assign the 
same post id to the basis book so that both books are picked up.

Robin,
I have to get this email out and I'm looking for your help. Can you proof 
read what I wrote and "correct" things that are wrong...

Thanks,

Frank



Debbie,


I spoke with Robin and she confirmed that:
One post id for both price and basis books
She overrides the price book

The reason is that Risktrac needs unique book id/post id combo's.  However, 
the price book comes in no matter what, so she overrides the price book in 
order to pull in the basis book...She added that she also did not understand 
why they use one post id..

Frank
