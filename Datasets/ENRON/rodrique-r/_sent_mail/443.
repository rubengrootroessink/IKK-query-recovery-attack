What...A tax book not helpful?  Aren't you glad you didn't have to suffer 
through that class?  Everything went fine this morning.  I just had to 
rebuild the bench and the basis report but that's all!!  Lavo seemed happy 
with everything this morning.  No screaming anyway.   And no I didn't get 
much sleep last night, but it wasn't really your fault.  Even after I went to 
bed I just kept waking up.  It was one of those nights where you wake up and 
look at the clock at least once every hour.  I feel a little dazed but other 
than that I'm okay.

And no I'm not glad to be back at work.  Are you?

Talk to ya later,
Robin

Subject: Your tax book

Hi!
How is it possible that my Financial Statement Analysis book was more helpful 
than your Tax book as far as how to handle NOL accounts?
It was not even worth carrying that heavy book. Just kidding, thank you very 
much anyways.  Was everything ok this morning?

I felt bad I left really late last night. I hope you got some good rest. 
Glad you are back at work?

Gabriel
