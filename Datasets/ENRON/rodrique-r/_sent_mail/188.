I have nothing to do either but I'm just surfing the web.  I'm not as 
dedicated as you are.

At that rate you will pay to get out of Houston right?     No worries, there 
is still another game on the 20th and the Season begins Feb 27th (this one is 
for points. The other two are Pre-season but still very competitive because 
they are organized by the league).  By the 27th, maybe you will already have 
finished GMAT. 

So, I guess I should not even worry about having told Purvi right?    Well, 
if you finish the benchmark early, you know where to go, but don't worry. I 
won't be expecting you. Let me know what you hear from Laura (if that is how 
you spell her name).  I will talk to the MD after lunch I guess. I'll let you 
know what the outcome was. 
There is absolutely nothing to do. I am educating myself by reading some 
things about Acquisitions.
