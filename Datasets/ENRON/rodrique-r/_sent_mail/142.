Nancy,

The OPTIONS-EXOTIC-PRC book should not have EXCELSHEETS as the database id.  
This post id is calced and officialized in ERMS.  The book administrator 
informed me that this post id contains only option premiums and does not 
contain positions.  

Hope that answers your questions.
Robin

Subject: DEC 29 '00 PostIDS

All:

Can you please review the attached and provide assistance in resolving.  We 
are trying to resolve why these postids did not get captured by  RisktRAC for 
Dec 29, 2000                   




1) For the Gas-Chase9 books does anyone know when the database ID was changed 
to ERMS OLD? Are these accrual books?

2)  Does anyone know why the Options-Exotic-PRC  book has a database id of 
EXCELSHEETS?  Is the book uploaded as a spreadsheet or is it suppose to feed 
from RisktRAC?

3) For the FT-EAST-BAS book, which is the correct postid?

4) For the Weather book does anyone know why the PostID was not 
officialized?  Does it need to be officialized?

Any help you can provide will be greatly appreciated.  They are in the 
process of tying out the Annual report and need to resolve these issues.



Regards,



Nancy
