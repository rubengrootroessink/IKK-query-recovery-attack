Guten Morgen!!!  I've decided to learn German since I'm not having any luck 
with Spanish.  Oh my goodness....some "lady" just walked by with her pajamas 
on I think.  And apparently they were her pajamas from when she was in high 
school b/c not only are they hideously ugly they don't fit anymore!!  It's 
really scary.  

Someone just called with work for me to do, so I'll talk to ya later.

I'm going to lunch with Shannon and Becky today if you want to come.  And yes 
you are really invited.  So let me know if you want to come and please be 
specific!!

Robin
