Yeah, I already told Jeff I was going to have to log on and ask Charlene 
what's wrong with the Analyst HR.  I can't wait.  But it's like I told him, 
if you ask her a questions she doesn't want to answer (which is almost any 
legitimate question) she just pretends you asked something else and answers 
that.  

I have King cake down here if you want some.  It's pretty good, but I've had 
better.   Alejandra was asking me if I had dinner last night.  I told her 
about our cooking experience.  Don't worry I told her it was good.  

Do you have lunch plans?
