Subject: Differences in Portfolio!

I compared the different portfolios in RisktRac and came up with the 
following changes. Hopefully this would help eliminate some of the 
differences amongst the different portfolios ....

FT-Peoples needs to be removed from P Keavey - Currently it is being double 
counted in P Keavey and J Williams.

The following books to be added to AGG-GASII
FT-CAND-EGSC-OPT-BAS 
FT-CAND-EGSC-OPT-PRC 
FT-HPLC-BAS 
FT-HPLC-PRC
FT-INT-CEN-MKT-GDL


These books to be added to AGG-GASIV, AGG-GASIII and Canada
FT-US/CAND-ERMS-GDL (Under J_McKay - Robin please confirm)


Please let me know if you have any other suggestions/comments to help solve 
this problem as soon as possible.

Bilal
