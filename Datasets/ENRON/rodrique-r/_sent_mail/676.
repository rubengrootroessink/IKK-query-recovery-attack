I'm working hard as usual.   I saw you call...don't start screaming yet...I 
had an IT guy and several other people at my desk at the time.   I saw Me, 
Myself, and Irene too.  It was pretty good as long as you're in the mood for 
stupid humor, which I was.  However the language and the "sons" got on my 
nerves.  Usually language doesn't bother me at all , but that was a little 
excessive.  Especially the marriage proposal!!  

Well I better get busy.  Bye.

We still need to go to lunch sometime.
