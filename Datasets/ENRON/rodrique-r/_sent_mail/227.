These books were officialized last night - the post id's are:

No I did not send the postid's Robin and Rahmann.  I did not realize I needed 
to do this every night.  We can send you our postid sheet everynight if this 
is 
what you need.  When can we expect to get these books off the list?  I keep 
offocializing but they keep showing up on the list.  The physical books may 
not be showing up 
because, as per a previous memo from you, the book names are actually 
INTRA-MONTH-CANADA, and then there are desks are CAN-WEST, CAN-BC and 
CAN-BCPIPE

Subject: Canada Intramonth books on unofficialized list

Kathy:

the following Canada intramonth books were on our unoofficialized list this 
morning.  Can you please provide postids for the the books.  I noticed that 
for Basis books the related Prc book did receive a post ID.  Were the post 
ids for the PRC books sent to Robin and  Roc so that they could override the 
basis information with the post ids?  Please advise as soon as possible.  I 
will be in class today, but please communicate with Burton regarding the 
status of these books.

I am anxious to get these glitches resolved, as I am sure you and your team 
are, so that we can confidently report the appropriate credit risk 
information.


I look forward to your reply.

Nancy
