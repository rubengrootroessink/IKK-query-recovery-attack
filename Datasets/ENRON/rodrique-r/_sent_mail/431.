My morning was great...no problems, everything nice and quiet the way I like 
it.  But this afternoon has been a little hectic.  Oh, well, it's making time 
go much faster.  Well except for the meeting with disable...that dragged on 
and on.  I'm so excited about getting out of here at a decent time.  If 
people will quit asking me questions so I can finish changing formulas on the 
basis report I'm going to get out of here by 3...that's my goal anyway.  

Talk to ya later,
Robin

Ps Congrats on realizing that you're a really smart guy and that it's your 
boss causing your stress!

He he, I sent you a call from somebody with a really weird name. Your friend 
Kathy wants to see a report.  Now I know who you are talking about.  Isn't 
she annoying?  

A meeting with Disable.... can't wait to have that much fun?

My day has been great. Well, more and more I realize that my stress is all my 
boss' fault.   Now that I have the associate with me I realize that he (my 
boss) does not explain things the way they should be explained.  The 
associate does not understand a lot of things because our boss hasn't come up 
with many of the assumptions needed for the project we are working on....... 
and I thought it was all my lack of knowledge.  Anyways, I think I just need 
to learn how to work with my new boss. I need to come up with my own 
assumptions. 

Hey, did those initials mean something? or were you just typing?  How is your 
day??  Are you excited you are going to get out of here at a descent time?

GM (is that better?)
