Me polite??  I think you have me confused with someone else.  You  are 
definitely invited.  And as for my family and friends, if you think you can 
stand them you're welcome to come along.  Some of my friends usually end up 
at my parents house anyway.  There's only one friend that'll I'll probably 
try to catch up with over Thanksgiving and we usually just go to dinner and 
catch a movie, so you are welcome to come.  

What'cha doing for lunch?

Robin

Robin, 

I thought you were just being polite and you felt bad because it was going to 
be a lonely Thanksgiving for me.  So, you were serious about it?   I really 
appreciate that you still keep me in mind, and I apologize for not having 
told you anything. I am sure you probably need to know to plan ahead. 
Ok, here is the plan. Let me make a few phone calls b/c  my best friend  from 
Cd. Juarez (border with El Paso, TX) said he  was going to Austin for that 
weekend  but nothing is for sure. Also, Ramiro was planning a trip, but I 
don't feel that bad If I decline b/c you know he loves finding foreigners to 
travel with. He actually already found somebody.   

Honestly, I did think about it, and I was a little worried that maybe you 
want to spend quality time with family and friends and I will be a perfect 
stranger there. (Ok, here is your chance to say "yeahh,  maybe you are right" 
"I want to spend time with my F & F)  Or if you are still being polite, then 
let me get bactk to you on that after I make those phone calls. 

THank you.

Gabriel
