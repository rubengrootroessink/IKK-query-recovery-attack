Vern,

I spoke with Annemieke and she said that you would be the person to contact 
about adding a report to the executive viewer.  We need to add a gas report.  
The title of the Report will be Natural Gas Basis by Trader.  I am attaching 
a copy of the report that will be published.  Please let me know if you need 
any additional information.  

Thank you for your help,
Robin
