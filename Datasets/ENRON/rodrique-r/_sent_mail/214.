I have lunch plans tomorrow (and I'm not sorry)...just kidding.  But I do 
have plans.  I could probably do Friday though.  Let me know if you can fit 
me into your busy schedule.

I didn't think you could forget me!  I actually do have lunch plans already 
(SORRY), but maybe tomorrow or Friday we could go.  I have been in Houston 
since the first of the year.  Shannon (my husband) and I bought a new house 
in Katy.  It's a long drive, but we really like it there.  Got to go.... 

Talk to you later,
JoAnne
