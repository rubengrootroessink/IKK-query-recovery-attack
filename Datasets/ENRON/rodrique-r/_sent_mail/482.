I couldn't send myself a net send.  Guess I'll just have to talk to myself 
the old fashioned way.

Subject: It worked

Thank you, it worked
 MS DOS definitely does not work for me anymore. It is weird because it works 
when I send myself a message. Try sending yourself a message to see what 
happens. Let me know. 

Have you kept up with any new information about Risk people? You know what I 
mean right ?
