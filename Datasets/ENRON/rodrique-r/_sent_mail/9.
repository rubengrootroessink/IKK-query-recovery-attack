Kathy,

I am attaching a revised P&L by Trader.  I moved the Term_GD p&l from Lambie 
to McKay.  We are, however, still off $35,000 on McKay.  It looks like the 
file got updated after we pulled in the final Feb. p&l.  Since we've already 
reported Feb, I can't restate something that would change the total p&l.  An 
adjustment will just need to be made in March to correct the Feb. variance.  



Robin

Robin,
I have a couple of differences for February. Could you please take a look at 
them. Kathy

Here you go.  This is the P&L we reported as of 3/2/01.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Robin,
Could you please send me Canada's p&L that you are reporting.  The same file 
that you sent last month is fine.  This is what our income should be.
Kathy
