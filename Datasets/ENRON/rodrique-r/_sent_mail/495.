Here's a mental picture for you of me when I got to the chafing part of your 
email...thumbs in ears, remaining fingers covering eyes, and repetitive 
chanting of la,la,la,la,la,la........  

I'm so disappointed but I won't be able to join you for the "fun run" on 
Thanksgiving.  I'm headed home to see the family.   I really wish you were 
here right now.  You are one of the few people that would truly appreciate 
how irritating this guy that sits next to me is!!!  He just asked someone how 
Chi-COG-OOOO was.  How do you accent every syllable (and then really drag out 
the last)???  Unfortunately that isn't nearly the most irritating thing that 
he does.  I'll update you as he provides me with more stories.

As for the food in Australia...it's really not all that different from here.  
I mean Sydney is a big city so they have just about every type of food.  They 
have a lot of American fast food chains.  The one that surprised me though 
was KFC...it's everywhere.  It's a lot more popular there than it is here.  I 
guess some of the biggest differences are that they eat pumpkin as a 
vegetable, and they put beets on their hamburgers, and they eat a lot of 
lamb.  Lamb is about as cheap and common as chicken is here.  And they eat 
meat pies....yuck.  The pastry is good on the pies but there's no flavor to 
the meat...it's just greasy ground beef.  I think they still have a little 
too much of a British influence in their food...they don't believe in 
seasoning.  

I saw quite a few good looking guys.  There was a lifesaver training course 
going on at Bondi while I was there.  That provided some great scenery!!  But 
then the problem is that the men don't realize when to stop wearing the 
speedos!!  The young guys look good in them, but after 30 they shouldn't be 
worn in public...and after 60 they shouldn't even be considered as underwear 
under six layers of clothing, but they especially shouldn't be worn on the 
beach!!!!  I saw one old man whose belly hung so low that I wasn't even sure 
he had a suit on, and I was scared to look too close for fear of what I might 
see and for fear he'd think I was interested.

Gotta go to a meeting.
Robin

Wow, what a trip.  Wish I could have been there to be with all those old
people.  I do have specific questions about Australia though.
How is the food?  Weird, good or just not worth eating?  What do they eat?
What did you eat?
See any good looking guys?
Did you make them speak just to hear the accent?  Did they make you speak
just to hear your accent?
Going back?
Megan enjoyed your email  message.  Needless to say so did I.
Ann and I ran a 25 K (15.5 miles) yesterday morning.  Got a T-shirt and a
banana for the run.  Neat, huh?  I was nine minutes slower this year than
last year but it doesn't bother me.  I had fun but at about mile 13 I was
definitely ready to cross the finish line.  I just had a couple more miles.
 My shorts chaffed the inside of my inner thighs and that was/is painful.
Is that too much information?  I can walk this morning but my legs are
fatigued.  I couldn't run from the front door to pick the newspaper off of
the front lawn this morning.  Pitiful.  Too bad you can't see and hear me
moan.  I'll just write it a couple of times.  Moan, moan.  There, that's
better.
Plans for Turkey Day?  Want to run a 5 K with Ann and I?  It'll be fun.
Let me know.  You know, I think Ann is going to Michigan, so it'll just be
me.  Maybe I'll just stay home and stuff my face.
Megan is very weak.  I sure do love that kid.
Well, don't work too hard.
See ya, Becky
