Harry,

A little birdie told me today was your birthday!!  Unfortunately the little 
birdie gave me the wrong email address the first time or you would have had 
this email earlier.  Anyway, I wanted to wish you a very Happy Birthday.  
Hope you have a great day and we'll see you guys this weekend.

Robin
