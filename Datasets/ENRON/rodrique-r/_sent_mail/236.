Hey Becky,

Shannon forwarded me your last email.  I'm so sorry.  I wish there was 
something I could do or say, but I know that I can't really say anything that 
would help.  Just know that I'm thinking about you guys.  I'm glad to hear 
you got to go running.  I'm sure that was a great stress relief.  How's your 
knee doing by the way.  

I'm still spending most of my days answering stupid questions.  Some people 
just drive me nuts.  They come freaking out telling me something's wrong.  
And if they just relax a minute I can usually explain the problem.  Most of 
the time it's not even wrong they just don't understand the reports.  They 
finally announced that we're selling HPL today.  It's about time that that's 
actually going to happen.  

You'll be glad to know that since I had way too much free time lately (I mean 
I been getting at least 4 hours of sleep lately...way more than any one 
person should have) I'm taking a GMAT review course.  We'll see in a couple 
of months if I have any hope of getting into graduate school.   You wanna 
hear the latest breaking news in my career?  If not skip the next couple of 
sentences.  Shannon doesn't even know this yet.  She might have if she'd quit 
blowing off our lunch plans.   I'm going to visit the Chicago office to talk 
to them about me working up there for a year.  I've talked to a manager in 
the office and the VP over the office already and the job sounds really 
interesting.  But I'm going to go up there and see if I think they are lying 
to me.  We'll see how that goes.  I'm not sure what I think about living 
somewhere that cold.  I'm not sure I even have clothes to go for the 
interview, much less to live up there.  

Has Shannon told you about the guy I'm seeing?  She doesn't think he's too 
bright.  He didn't exactly make the best first impression on her.  He really 
is smart no matter what she tells you.  He's a super nice guy, much nicer 
than me (I know, I know that's not saying much).  But the best part is we 
really have a lot of fun together.  We're always laughing and cutting up when 
we're together.  He's from Mexico and we worked together until the end of 
October when he moved to another group.  Then he came home with me for 
Thanksgiving, but we were still just friends then.  It was pretty obvious 
that there was more there though.  We started dating the next weekend.  It's 
been kind of crazy though.  Since we worked together and we had to review 
each other and we didn't want everyone in our business we haven't told anyone 
we work with that we're dating.  So that's been pretty interesting.  No one's 
said anything yet, but I know there are plenty of rumors going around.  It 
really wouldn't bother me if people found out now since reviews are over and 
he and I are comfortable enough with each other that we can take all the 
questions and harrassment from everyone in risk.  

Well my boss has walked by about 10 times and seen me doing nothing but 
sending emails each time, so I probably better get back to work.  I'd love to 
hear from you if you have time.  If not I understand.  

Robin
