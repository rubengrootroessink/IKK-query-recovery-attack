It was hard to wake up after that dinner though.  Was it hard for you?  I 
feel like my whole body is swollen. 
My boss is sick again today.  Now, the outcome of that is really uncertain. 
He will either delay the whole due dilligence  process or maybe he will want 
to catch up and have us work even harder during the weekend.  

PS if you catch the cruise in New Orleans  after Christmas, do you think 
you'll make it to Veracruz for New Year's Eve.
