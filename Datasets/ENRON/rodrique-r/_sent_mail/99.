Susan,

The NG-PRICE-PRC book will now be calculated using two post ids.  Therefore, 
we need an additional RisktRAC book id for the Price book so that we can 
capture both post ids.  Please set up an NG-PRICE2-PRC book with the same 
attributes as the NG-PRICE-PRC book.  The new books needs to be added to the 
AGG-GAS, AGG-GASIII and AGG-GASIV portfolios.  In AGGIII and IV, please set 
up a separate portfolio for the new book.  The new portfolio should be named 
M_Maggi.  

If you have any questions, give me a call.
Thanks,
Robin
