Yeah you're gonna have to explain that one...I'm confused.  I didn't go last 
year so I don't know how they check everyone at the door.  

I know what you meant in your earlier email.  That was kind of strange.  
Hopefully I'll get out of here at a decent time.  And if I can get my 
accomplishments done during the day today that would be fabulous.  Maybe I 
could even come watch you play soccer.   But all that hinges on my 
accomplishments.  And of course since I put it off until today, we violated 
every limit we have this morning!  Well we didn't violate p&l, just VAR and 
positions.  So I'm sure I'll spend most of the day answering questions.

See you at lunch.
Robin

I have a question. Do you think it is possible to RSVP for the X-mas Party - 
you and your invitee- then your invitee shows up without you? Do you think 
they'll let him/her get in?

I'll explain what I am trying to do at lunch or Brown Bag.

Gabriel
