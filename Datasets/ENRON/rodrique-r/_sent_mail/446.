Are you thinking that there's a problem with Canada's position?

Subject: Spreadsheet example

Brian, please see the file below.  It  represent an example of a spreadsheet 
that we use on a regular basis for uploading positions.  I am sure that you 
guys are familiar with the format and what goes where.  The important thing 
is to have the book name and the reference dates and the delta positions all 
correct.  Call me if any questions.

BM
