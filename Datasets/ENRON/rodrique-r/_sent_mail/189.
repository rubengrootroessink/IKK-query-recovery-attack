Hey,

It doesn't look like I'm going to make your soccer game tonight.  In fact, I 
won't make the GMAT class either.   Rock officially resigned yesterday, which 
means there's no way they'll let him back in the building.  So I'm now 
running the bench again.  At least until I can get Binh comfortable running 
it.  Maybe that offer in Chicago wasn't so bad after all.  

Enough whining for now.

Talk to ya later,
Robin
