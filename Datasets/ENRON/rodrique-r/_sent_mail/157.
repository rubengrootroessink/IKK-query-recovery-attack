Nancy,

The new attributes you have assigned to the IM-EMWNSS2-PHY  book are 
duplicating the attributes of the INTRA-EMWNSS1-PHY book.  Per my original 
request please change the region code for IM-EMWNSS2-PHY to Midwest_Old, 
since it is my understanding from Burton that this book should no longer be 
used.

If you have any more questions, give me a call.
Robin

Robin:

Per your request, the attributes on FT-IM-ENOV-PHY have been changed as 
follows



	Portfolio Code	Book Code	Book Type	Book Flag	Commodity	Region Code
OLD ATTRIBUTES	1	E	M	P	NG	MIDWEST
NEW ATTRIBUTES	P	A	M	P	NG	MIDWEST

In order to prevent duplicate book attributes,  IM-EMWNSS2-PHY attributes 
were also changed as follows:


	Portfolio Code	Book Code	Book Type	Book Flag	Commodity	Region Code
OLD ATTRIBUTES	P	A	M	P	NG	MIDWEST
NEW ATTRIBUTES	P	A	M	P	NG	MIDWEST1

These changes will properly report the ERMS positions in the FT-IM-ENOV-PHY 
book as apposed to IM-EMWNSS2-PHY, which should have no positions.


If you have any questions, please call me at ext 54751


Nancy
