Sorry to hear you're having a bad day.  If it helps mine's not much better.  
I've been harrassed by at least half the company, I think.  Frank's out of 
the office, so I've got Sunil's replacement (who doesn't have a clue) calling 
me every two minutes, as well as Vlady calling, and the out of Control group 
calling, and Canada calling trying to get their p&l right......it's been 
nuts.  I was hoping today would be boring so I could do GMAT homework.  I 
would love to get out of the building for a little while.  Some lady just 
asked me for directions to get off this floor...  Does this seem scary to 
you??  Especially when you consider she was facing the neon EXIT sign down 
the hall.  Wow!!  Apparently everyone's lost their mind today.  

Hope your day gets better.
Robin
