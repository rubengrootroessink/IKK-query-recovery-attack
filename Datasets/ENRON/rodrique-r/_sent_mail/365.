No.  That's not the gossip.  I probably have you more excited than you should 
be now.  It's not as interesting as you're probably thinking now.  I spent 
three hours dozing through defensive driving this afternoon.  It's horrible.  
They just keep saying the same things over and over.  

What time do you think you'll get out of here tonight?  At the rate we're 
going I'm never going home.  No one is finished yet.  Talk to ya later.

I hope the gossip is not about Jennifer  finding out about you know what.  We 
did not have Spanish. Even though I am not busy we were kind of determined to 
finish fixing the model. We are tired of it.  I am also tired of looking at 
it. Did you start watching Defensive Driving?
