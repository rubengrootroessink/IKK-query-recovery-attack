I'm glad to know your sister has a sense of humor, and that I can quit 
looking over my shoulder all the time.  So what's going on down there today?  
So far my day's much quieter than yesterday...THANK GOODNESS.  Everyone and 
their brother harrassed me yesterday.  Here was the best one though.  A 
manager in another group told one of his analyst to give me his(the 
analyst's) password to the VAR system so I could print some reports for 
him(the manager).  He wanted me to do it so that he could have them on his 
desk when he gets here at 7:30.  Here's the best part though it takes about 
30 minutes to print all these reports.  So essentially he was asking me to 
come in at 5:00 so that neither he nor his analyst had to come in until 
7:30.  I told the analyst to tell him, "Not just no, but HELL NO!!  I don't 
work for him, and  I have more important things to do.  If he had any 
questions to give me a call and I'd be glad to explain further."  Funny, I 
didn't hear from him yesterday.  I was actually hoping he'd call because I 
had had enough of doing other people's jobs yesterday and it would have been 
nice to chew someone out.  

Talk to ya later,
Robin
