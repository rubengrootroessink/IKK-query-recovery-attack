Brian/Kathy,

I have attached a copy of a report that is given to John Lavorato every 
morning.  This report shows basis positions by trader for specific points.  
Please let me know if the positions we are reporting for the Canadian traders 
are correct.  If you unhide columns C-S you will find the curves that are 
added in each section.  The curves highlighted in green are used for 
intramonth positions and the white are the basis curves.   The intra-month 
position that shows is a combination of  physical and gas daily.  All other 
time periods are only basis notional.  If you have any questions give me a 
call.  

Thanks,
Robin
