Brian,

Just a couple of things.  First the risk type on the spreadsheets needs to be 
the same as on the files I sent to you.  Second, I am attaching a copy of the 
positions that I queried out of GRMS after I loaded your text files.  The 
positions aren't even close to the IM Positions file you save out to our 
directory.  I have also included the detail that supports the GRMS position.  
Our goal with the text files is to eliminate the need for plugging your 
positions and to ensure that your correct position is included in the VAR 
calculation.  Let me know if there is anything I can do to help you resolve 
this variance.  

Thanks,
Robin
