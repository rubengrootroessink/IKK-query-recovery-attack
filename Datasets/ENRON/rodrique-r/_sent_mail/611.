We have spaces available at the Allen Center Garage for $89.00 per month, 
payroll deductible. If you are interested, please reply via e-mail ASAP by 
5:00 p.m., Monday, August 7.

Your parking access card will be ready for pick-up on Tuesday, August 8.

If you are currently parking in a garage that is subsidized by Enron, you 
will need to turn in that access card in exchange for an Allen Center access 
card.
