I think we should park at Samy's again.  What have you been up to today?  
I've been "training" Bilal.  It's really hard to be patient answering 
questions when you are trying to get something done quickly.  He asked me who 
knew the reports besides me.  I told him it was going to be up to him and 
Binh to know all the reports.  I told him I wasn't going to leave my new 
phone number.  

Talk to ya later,
Robin

Ok, don't make any nap or sleep early plans for tomorrow. We are going to the 
Rodeo.   What do you think about parking. Do we park at
Samy's Parking lot? or do you want me to look into buses?

Gabriel
