What's going on?  Nothing is happening down here.  I know I whine when I'm 
too busy, but frankly I'm having trouble thinking of things to do today.  Are 
you guys busy?  Is your boss freaking out today?  I just got a call from AA, 
so I guess that'll keep me busy for a while. 

Do you have lunch plans?  I'm thinking about just a trip to the cafeteria.  
Let me know if you want to join me.

Robin
