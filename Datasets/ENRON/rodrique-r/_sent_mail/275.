Subject: Origination  

Beginning this week an Origination report will be given to Fred Lagrasta each 
morning.  The information for this report is taken from the Origination 
schedule tab of your P&L file.  It is imparative that all the information is 
filled out for each origination granted.  The item most commonly overlooked 
is deal volume.  There is also additional information that is now required 
for all Middle Market Nymex Originations.  

Please add the following columns to your Origination Schedule:
Buy/Sell
Term of the Deal
Price
Pub Code

If you have any questions or you are no longer responsible for updating the 
origination schedule, please call me.

Thank you for your help.
