Are you inviting me or just asking if the boat will make it on time?  If you 
invitingme I'd love to come but....I have to be back here the day after 
Christmas.  And Rock's off that week so there's no chance I could take off.   
I'll just have to stay here all by myself.  

If we go to lunch today, it'll have to be kind of quick.  I have my meeting 
with the analyst people at 11:30 and another meeting at 1:00.  

Bye.
RR

It was hard to wake up after that dinner though.  Was it hard for you?  I 
feel like my whole body is swollen. 
My boss is sick again today.  Now, the outcome of that is really uncertain. 
He will either delay the whole due dilligence  process or maybe he will want 
to catch up and have us work even harder during the weekend.  

PS if you catch the cruise in New Orleans  after Christmas, do you think 
you'll make it to Veracruz for New Year's Eve.
