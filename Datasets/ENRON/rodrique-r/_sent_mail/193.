I already checked the blue book for the Chicago area and it's exactly the 
same as for Houston.  Which means that the prices should be comparable, so 
I'll probably try to sell it here first.   I just found out that I should 
have the "offer" in a couple of hours.  It's a big mess.  I'll have to tell 
you that story later.  My blood pressure surely shot up after talking to the 
analyst HR moron.  If you need any help cracking some heads I'm certainly in 
the mood for it!!

I'll let you know what I find out.  
Robin

Well,  you are in a good position because you could sell your car but you 
don't necessarily have to.  In Enron terms this would be called a put option 
and we charge for it, so make sure you pay me premium.    The actual 
paperwork takes no time. It could be done in a day. Now, if your question was 
the time that you can actually find a potential buyer....well, that really 
depends on how much you want for it.  Have you decided on a  "floor".  In 
other words, decide how much is the minimum you would accept for your car.   
Another thing I would do is check the prices in Chicago.  Prices for cars 
vary a little  depending on the city. So see if comparable cars in Chicago 
are selling for less, that way, it might be a good opportunity to try to sell 
it here.  SInce you don't have to sell it, I would check the market very very 
well.  You don't need the money, and you don't need to sell it. You have the 
power. If you decide to advertise it,  don't mention anything about Chicago. 

I'll help you with research later. 

Gabriel
