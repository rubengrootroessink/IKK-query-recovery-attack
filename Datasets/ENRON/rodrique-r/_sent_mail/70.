I've dragged you to two country concerts, so you can pick this one.  Either 
is fine with me.  I promise.  Mom and I did have a good weekend.  We were 
laughing last night b/c we really didn't do anything.  We just sat around and 
talked and watched movies all weekend.  She said to tell you she's sorry she 
ruined your weekend.  I told her you didn't mind that she was here.  

What'd you end up doing last night?

Talk to ya later,
Robin
