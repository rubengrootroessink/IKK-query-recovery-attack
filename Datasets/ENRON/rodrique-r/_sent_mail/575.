How scandulous of your mother!!  My mother would never use sucks...but my dad 
told me something pissed him off one time.  I was completely shocked...I 
didn't even know what to say.  I know it's hard to imagine me speechless, but 
I was.  

You should know by now that I'm heartless and that my grandmother will have 
to go the hospital all alone.  I had to listen to her last time whine about 
how no one respects her.  It took everything I had not to say, "Of course we 
don't respect you.  We all know you're crazy."  

What are you doing for lunch Friday (as in probably the day you're reading 
this)?  I'm going to come in early b/c I've been bombarded as soon as I walk 
in the door the last two days.  

Let me know if you want to go to lunch.  I'll call you when I get in.  

I'll be praying for Megan.
