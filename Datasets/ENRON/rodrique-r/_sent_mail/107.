About the third time I read your email I understood it.  I kept reading Jaime 
as the English name Jamie (Jay-me).  I had no clue what you were talking 
about.  But don't worry I'm caught up now.  

And I thought I had bad eating habits...I've never had pepperoni pizza for 
breakfast.  I still have half of this king cake left, and I'm not  taking it 
home b/c I have another one there, so you need to come get some.  

I'd have a little fun with your friend before you tell him the truth...that 
you blew him off.

Jaime just sent me an email apologizing because he could not find me. He said 
that he asked everybody (friends you have not met). A couple of Nicaraguans, 
and  some other colombians.  Before Jaime, Hector and I moved out of Austin, 
I used to hang out with all these people. Harry does not particularly like 
them, but Ramiro was also part of this group.  Anyways, Jaime kept asking for 
Harry's phone number and nobody knew his phone number, so he thinks he stood 
me up. 

Hmmm, what should I say. Should I say I was waiting for his call all weekend 
long, or just tell him the truth?  

Yeahh I want to try your King cake.  I am not hungry at all though. OUr 
assistants kept getting creative every day and our breakfast was getting 
better and better. I am not sure what happened last time they ordered. They 
must have been stoned. We had Peperoni calzone for BREAKFAST!!!!!!!. The 
worst part is that I ate one. My stomach is a little upset.  Too much junk 
food in less than 24 hours.
