What did you charge $1,000 for?  I haven't gotten anywhere on my 
accomplishments.  Right after I emailed you we discovered some major issues 
with the basis report, so it looks like I'll be doing accomplishments 
tonight.  I'm still hoping I can come to your game though.  It doesn't start 
until 8:45 right?

Bye,
Robin
