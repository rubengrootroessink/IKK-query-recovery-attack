Here a quick summation of my morning...CANADA SUCKS!!!!  First they 
rearranged their P&L file and moved the order that the traders appear and 
don't bother to tell us, but here's the fun part they didn't rename the 
columns.  So they had McKay's P&L reported in a  column that was titled 
Lambie.  Makes perfect sense right?  Then they call me and tell me that they 
need to move Disturnal's position and VAR under John Arnold, but they want to 
keep his p&l in Canada.  Another fun bit of Canadian "logic."

And here my favorite.  I got an email from Kathy this morning in reply to an 
email I sent her on December 8.  She told me that the p&l we reported for the 
first quarter of 2000 was wrong and we need to change our numbers by 4 
million to match was she thinks it should be!!!  She said that they adjusted 
the DPR in the summer to move 4 million from trading to originations.   As if 
that isn't bad enough, consider the fact that I've already explained to her 
at least twice that she's completely high b/c I tie to the DPR for Canadian 
p&l and for the originations total.  

Excluding canada (I've decided they don't deserve to have their country 
capitalized) my day's been good.   I'll have to fill you in on all the EMT 
stories my friend told me.  They were really funny.

I'll whine more later,
Robin

You never told me about the glass eye. That must have been a very embarrasing 
situation. I wonder if  that is painful. I imagine not. Maybe it was painful 
to EMT's pocket since I am sure they paid for the replacement.

Hey, are going to Jeff Skilling's Analyst kick off ?   How's your day? Mine 
is going to be pretty good as long as I stay away from embarrasing 
situations.
