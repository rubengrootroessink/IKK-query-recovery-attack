Becky,

It's good to have you back...I don't think I've eaten at Luther's since the 
last time we all went together.  Tomorrow's good for me.  How's it going 
being back at work?  Did you have 50 million emails to plow through?

OK, I smelled Luthers this morning.  It was killing me.  Yum, yum.  How about 
lunch tomorrow?  B
