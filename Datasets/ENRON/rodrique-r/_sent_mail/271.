You crack me up...I think I only know one person who has worse luck at work 
than you do, and that would be my EMT friend that broke someone's glass eye.  
I can't believe your boss is making you work on Monday...even we don't have 
to work Monday.  

I'll talk to ya later,
Robin

Oohhh that is fine. Not a problem.  I love biiiiigggg breakfasts in NIICE 
restaurants. 

What is up with me in this group. They are definitely going to fire me. We 
were in a conference call with  the CEO of the Transportation company. His 
counselors, his tax lawyer, his investment bank, my boss, our counselor, our 
tax expert, and other very important people. Actually the conference was very 
very interesting. We (they, I just listened)basically talked about what to do 
with the unvested options of all the employees from the transport company, we 
talked about how the deal was going to change from a Stock purchase to a 
Merger. We talked about tax strategies, etc. It was very interesting.  HERE 
is the funny part. When we were discussing about all these things, I decided 
to stretch my leg  and guess what? "I unplugged the phone line".  Yeahh we 
missed some of the conversation.   My boss was like "ohhh sh.....".  I 
thought it was funny, but obviously he did not think so. 

Oohhh you know what. I actually work Monday. My boss decided to veto our 
holiday Monday.   I am going to come in just to sort out all the due 
dilligence paperwork. It will be for a couple of hours only. YOu can take my 
car, and when the car is ready, you can probably pick me up and we'll go and 
pick it up.
