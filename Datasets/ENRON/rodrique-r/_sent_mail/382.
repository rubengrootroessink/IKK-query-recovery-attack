What CRAP!!!  They have no political voice and the machines are old, give me 
a break!  They didn't have a problem electing more blacks to their 
legislature, so I guess they weren't denied the right to vote.  That last 
quote by Jackson!!!  Oh my goodness, cry me a river.  

I can't believe they can even say all this crap with a straight face.  But 
then I'm sure I'm prejudice.  

Don't send me any more of this crap today.  I'm trying to enjoy my Friday.  
I'm headed to Ruston this weekend.  I'm going to see Tech and Tennessee.  I 
think I told you that already.  I'm going to visit Fake family while I'm 
there of course.  

Talk to ya later,
Robin
