Happy Valentine's Day to you too!  And I'm not antiromantic...I'm just not as 
romantic as some people.  It could be worse.  I could be like my mom...she's 
less romantic than me.  

Tambien te quiero MUcho.

Happy Valentine's Day. 

I do not need a day like this to be romantic with an antiromantic person, but 
I just wanted to let you know that 
TE QUIERO MUCHO.
