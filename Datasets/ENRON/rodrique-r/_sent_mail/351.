I wasn't worried about you making it.  I was worrried about you making it 
back in time to give me my presents.  I work with a guy in our Chicago 
office.  He said it was pretty bad there.  I told him you were headed up 
there and he said he hoped you didn't mind delays.  Glad you made it safely.  

You know you can buy disposable cameras at most stores.  

Try to stay warm.
Robin

I hate to disappoint you, but I made it alive. With no
delays actually. I'm now staring out of a window
watching it snow (that's the cold white stuff that you
see on TV). They're expecting 6" today ontop of what
is already here. Everything is white...it looks like a
postcard. Wish I had thought to bring a camera. The
temperature when I landed was ZERO degrees. Today will
reach a balmy 22 degrees.
