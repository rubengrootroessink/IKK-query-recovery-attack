I was trying to tell you that the blonde chick from Donna's group is down 
here.  The woman that's always whining about something.  She's driving me 
nuts.  That and the fact that I had a long meeting this morning with your 
other buddy, Chris Disable.  All we did was go in circles for about 45 
minutes.

How's your day going?
