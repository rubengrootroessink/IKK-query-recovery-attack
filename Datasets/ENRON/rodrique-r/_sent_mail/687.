Hey Guys,

We are still not pulling the Intra-Cand-West-Phy book into the benchmark.  I 
have talked to the systems administrator and he thinks it might be in how the 
book is set up in the system.  I have attached below a copy of the screen 
that shows how we have desigated the various codes for this book.  Please 
look at this and verify that we have it set up properly.  If you have any 
questions feel free to give me a call.

I am also attaching the detail that I pulled out of the GRMS system.  Please 
take a look at it and help me identify what is causing our variances.  For 
instance I am pulling a position of (245) contracts for July Price and you 
show a position of long 241 contracts.  




Thanks,
Robin
