When David told me I had to go, I told him I already knew how to avoid 
harrassment...just stay away from he and Jeff.  But I guess since I have 
nothing else to do I might as well go.

Muahaaaaaaa, that is me laughing. I really laughed when i received this 
email.  No, nobody harasses me, so I am not going. I think somebody is 
harassing you. I will be here. Have fun, and save me some of that cake.
