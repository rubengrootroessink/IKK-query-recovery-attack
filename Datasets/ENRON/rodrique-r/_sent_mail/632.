Hey,

I did think of something Dad might want.  He was really excited when mom gave 
him the Biblical reference book for Father's day, so maybe we could get him 
something like that.  Call mom and ask her what he wants.  

Authur Anderson, huh??  You do know they are slave drivers, right??  Of 
course I'm sure it's no worse than my current job!!  I find it pretty funny 
that you wrote that to my from your work email.   

Well it's about time I got started working today.

Robin
