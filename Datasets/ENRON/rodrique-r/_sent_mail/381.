Thank goodness she's in when Congress will be a complete deadlock on every 
issue that is brought up!!  I really don't want  a government that can't even 
manage their money or make a decision in under a year deciding what doctor I 
can see.  It probably will reduce medical cost significantly.  People will 
just die before they can wade through the red tape to go to the doctor!!!

Later,
Robin
