I told you I had a rough day!!!  I was DYING by the last game.   I've never 
felt that out of shape.   So what are you still doing here?

OK, you get sympathy with a raspberry.  That's pretty intense to slide!  I 
don't even sprint.  Wow.  B

You must be having a bad day!!  But you know it's not my fault...and there's 
nothing soft about softball!!  And I slid yesterday, twice, so I have a 
little bit of a rasberry on my calf.  Did that get me any sympathy??  
Probably not!  I hope you finish close soon.

No.  Not softball.  SOFT is the key word.  B.
Hard ass, aren't I?

I'm glad to know I'm not the only one that's this sore.  We should be sore 
though.  We played 5 games.  And I played every second of every game.  Now 
don't you feel sorry for me?!
