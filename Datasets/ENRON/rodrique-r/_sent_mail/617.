Hey Brian,

I'm having to plug your positions again.  I checked the conversion factors 
and I have the same ones that you have on the IM Positions tab of your excel 
file.  Let me know if you have any ideas as to what the problem might be.  
I'm attaching a copy of the positions that I pulled in and the detail.  I'll 
talk to you tomorrow.



Thanks,
Robin
