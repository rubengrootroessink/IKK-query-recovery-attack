I remember when I was Looking for an apartment the locator always made a sale 
pitch on the fireplace. I always said I didn't care. This is the time  when 
you regret that, but anyways.   I first thought of just going to dinner, then 
I thought of maybe doing something else.  Now, I don't know anything.  Why 
do  you need to know if we do something else?   Do you worry you might go to 
bed a little late?   I do not want you to not get a good sleep just because 
of my birthday!!

I'll keep thinking. I will be here and probably will not go to my french 
class. I need to finish something and would rather skip french that be 
working here after class.

So are you thinking going to dinner or something else?  I need to know if you 
just can decide on a resturant or you can decide on what to do?  And if you 
want to do something other than eat you need to let me know.  

We could just curl up in front of the fireplace...oh wait neither of us have 
a fireplace.  Guess we'll have to think of something else.
