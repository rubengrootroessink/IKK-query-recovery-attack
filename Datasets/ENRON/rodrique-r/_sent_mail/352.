I'm finally finished with Defensive Driving.  What a complete waste of my 
time!!  I passed though.  Can you imagine failing and having to take it 
again?!!  I think I'd rather just pay the extra insurance than sit through 
that again.   It turns out that I only had about 20 minutes left to watch.  
If I'd known that I would have finished it yesterday.  

Have you decided what you want to do tonight?  I had a great nap, so I'm up 
for whatever you want to do (within reason that is). 

Gotta go Canada's calling.
Robin
