What's up?  Are you sore from all that hard work on the soccer field 
yesterday?  I'm bored today.  So tell me something.  Do you think I should 
pull rank on Binh for Valentines day and just tell her "I've been here 
longer, so you can work Valentines night."  The only thing that makes me feel 
bad about that is that she's had that day scheduled for vacation for a 
while.  

Jeff is probably wondering why he pays me today.  I went for a 30 minute 
coffee break with Alejandra and I haven't done anything constructive since 
I've been back.  Oh well.  I really don't have anything to do though.  

Te quiero.
Robin
