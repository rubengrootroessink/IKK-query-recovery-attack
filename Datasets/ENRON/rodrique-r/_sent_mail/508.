I paid about $94 Austalian which is around $50.  It was a pretty big, and 
definitely awkward (that word doesn't look right) that's why it flew home on 
it's own.  Besides I already had my luggage allotment.  My box wasn't nearly 
as heavy as yours is.  What kind of tree did you buy???  What is it an iron 
statue of a tree?  

Are you leaving tomorrow?  I know I've asked you this before but I can't 
remember.  If you don't have any plans let's go to lunch.

Thanks,  I'll send this to Ibrahim and he will then send that to the guy in 
EBS.  I have a few  questions for you.  How much did you pay for the box that 
was sent to you from Australia?  Why did you not take it with you? 

Ok, this is the story. My mom asked me if I could buy a Christmas tree,and of 
course, being a super duper nice son as I am, I was stupid enough to buy it. 
Well the box is about 63 lbs. and 57 x 14 inches . I called Continental and 
they said they would accept it.  Well, I am not sure about the whole thing. 
First, it is so big that it doesn't even fit in my car. I had to take it home 
with the trunk open. I'll see how I can figure this out, but I just wanted to 
ask you about the box from Australia. 

Anyways, I hope I can see you before I leave for Mexico. I probably just drop 
by and say bye. Of course I have not packed and still have to buy a few 
things. Have a nice day. I'll let you know about the whole EBS thing.
