It wasn't just me changing plans.  All I ask is that sometime over the 
weekend we see Finding Forrester.  And of course get my car aligned Sat. and 
a tuneup Monday.  Now that I'm thinking about it I'm going to be spending a 
lot of money this weekend on things that aren't exactly fun.  Oh well.  

I'm planning to get out of here around 4:30ish if nothing goes wrong.  So 
just call me at home when you get home.  Oh, yeah....Chipper means happy, or 
in a good mood, kind of in a bouncy mood.

Talk to ya later,
Robin
