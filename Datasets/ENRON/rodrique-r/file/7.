Debbie,
I spoke with Robin, and from what we know Canada officializes one calc that 
includes both their price and basis positions.  (Calc is represented by the 
orange)    However, Risktrac only recognizes the book id to which it assigns 
the post id. (It appears that it is only the PRC book that comes through, the 
BAS book is represented by the red "x", however it is in the same calc.).  
Since the Canadian post id only includes two books ids,  the Benchmark group 
manually assign the same post id to the basis book, that way both books get 
picked up.

Does this help?

Frank
