Hey,

I have an exam tomorrow and I'm heading home to grab my books and come back 
here to study. I"m leaving in about 15 minutes. If I don't get the file, 
check out my stuff below, and I should be back by 8:45 your time.

Your position still hasn't pulled in...I think the system's just running 
really slow.  I'll give you a call when I get it.
