For those tired of the usual "friend" poems, a touch of truth!


When you are sad,.............I will get you drunk and help you plot revenge
against the scum sucking bastard who made you sad.
When you are scared,.........I will laugh at you and tease you about it
every chance I get.
When you are worried,.........I will tell you how much worse it could be and
to quit complaining.
When you are confused,........I will use little words to explain it to your
dumb butt.
When you are sick.........I will hold your hair while you pay homage to the
porcelain god.
When you fall......I will point and laugh at your clumsy butt.
This is my oath...............I pledge this till the end.
Why you may ask?...............Because you're my friend.

Hope it made you laugh - but you know I got your back!!!!!!!!
