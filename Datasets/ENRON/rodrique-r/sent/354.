I thought about giving you a personal Happy Birthday wake up call this 
morning when I got up, but I thought after the night before you probably 
needed all the sleep you could get.  So see here I was being nice...there's 
just no pleasing some people.  

I got home about 10 last night which I was pretty excited about.  But no 
sooner did I get comfortable as I got a call from Rock.  AAAAAAHHHHHHHH.  
Sorry that just slipped out.  I'll have to vent later.

I'll give you a birthday call later.
Robin

Don't you think that you are going to get away with just leaving a message.  
I am waiting for a more personal Happy Birthday call. 

Thanks anyways. 

What time did you get out of here yesterday?

Gabriel
