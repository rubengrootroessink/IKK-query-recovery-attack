  important  information to help you use these services. Be sure
  to save this email for future reference.

  If you are not too familiar with using the Web, you should
  check  out "Web 101" at the HotWired site. It's a great
  resource that'll answer just about every question you could
  have about the Web. You can find it at:

        http://www.hotwired.com/web101

  SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
  -------------------
  To use all of the features on the website, you'll need the
  following:

   Web Browser:
 ------------
 PC Users will need Internet Explorer version 5.0 and above
 or Netscape Navigator 4.7 or above.
 MAC Users will need Netscape 4.7 or above.
 JavaScript and Cookies must both be enabled. This is
   the default setting on both browsers so if you haven't changed
   anything, you don't need to worry about this.

 Finally, you=01,ll need a Flash and Acrobat enabled browser.  If
 you do not have these, you need not worry.  Simply click on the
 Requirements Check link after Logging In and clicking on the
 same link off of the Getting Started Page.  The Online check
 will allow you to download all necessary plug-ins.

  Students preparing for all other tests:

 Web Browser:

   Netscape Navigator 4.0 or higher or Internet Explorer 4.0 or
   higher. JavaScript and Cookies must both be enabled. This is
   the default setting on both browsers so if you haven't changed
   anything, you don't need to worry about this. For best
   results, we recommend using Netscape. If you need to download
   a new web browser, you can do so at the following address:

  LOGGING IN

  Whenever you go to the Princeton Review website
  http://www.princetonreview.com, you should click on the "Course
  Students Click Here" button that appears at the top of each
  page. To enable your course services, simply enter your
  username and password in the appropriate fields on the page.
  For your records, here are the username and password you

  dorm, it's a very good idea to log out when you finish your
  work on the website. All you have to do is click on the "Log
  Out" link that appears on every page after you log in.

  TAKING TESTS & DRILLS ONLINE
  -----------------------------
  Students taking GMAT, GRE, and USMLE courses will take all of
  their computerized diagnostic tests on the web. Offering
  tests online makes it possible to always ensure that you have
  the most  up-to-date questions available that reflect the
  current make up of the test. It also makes it possible to
  provide detailed analysis of your performance to your
  instructors.

  SAT students can find a plethora [if you don't know this word,
  look it up now!] of drills which target certain problem types.
  If you want to find an extra set of medium geometry questions
  or hard average problems, check out the online drills! You can
  also check out our multimedia versions of the same techniques
  you've been learning in class, to help you remember what you've
  learned.

  GRE and GMAT students, please hold off on taking any online tests
  or drills until your course starts.  Your Princeton Review
  instructor will assign each of the online tests and drills during
  specific points during the program.

  USMLE students, please take Test 1 online prior to attending your
  first class.  Your Princeton Review instructor will assign each of
  the remaining online tests and drills during specific points during
  the program.

  LSAT students, although you will be taking your course practice tests
  in a proctored environment (the LSAT is still a pencil-and-paper test,
  after all) the website does contain detailed explanations for every
"real"
  LSAT problem you will be doing in the course.  Further, if you
supplement
  your course materials with additional real LSATs, you will find online
  explanations for these questions as well.

  TECHNICAL SUPPORT
  ------------------
  Tech support is available at no charge to all Princeton Review
  course students Monday through Friday from 10am until 11pm
  Eastern and Saturday from 12pm to 6pm Eastern. You can reach
  tech support by either phone or email:

       Tech Support Email: websupport@review.com
       Tech Support Phone Number: 1-800-546-2102

  Once again, thanks for choosing The Princeton Review. You are
  well on the way to higher scores!

  Regards,
  The Folks at Princeton Review Online
