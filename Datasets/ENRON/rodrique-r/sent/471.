Sounds like you have a wild night planned.  I don't think I'm up to that kind 
of partying tonight.  I've actually finished the evaluations, but I haven't 
submitted them yet.  I'll do that today.  Thanks for the warning though.  

How late were you here last night?  How did everything turn out with your 
boss yesterday?

Later,
Robin

Did you finish all your evaluations?  

I haven't .  I called  PEP and they are going to shut the system down at 
midnight tonight.  Just wanted to let you know in case you are planning on 
having an awesome friday afternoon like I am.  I am going to bring popcorn 
and a good CD.
