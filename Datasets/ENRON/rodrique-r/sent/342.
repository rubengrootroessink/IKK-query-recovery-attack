Hey Becky,

I haven't heard from you in a while.  I know, I know, you haven't heard from 
me either.  I wanted to check in and see how you're doing.  I talked to 
Shannon and she filled me in on how Megan's doing.  I want you to know my 
family and I are praying for you guys.  I know everyone says this but if 
there is anything I can do I'd love to help out.  I'm going Christmas 
shopping this weekend if you need me to pick up anything for you.  I've got 
to finish all my shopping and buy something for my mom from my dad.  He had a 
hip replacement in October and is still hobbling around.  He's actually doing 
really well considering he had major surgery.   I think he expected to be 
running marathons by now.  

I'd love to tell you at lot of interesting things going on in my life right 
now, but unfortunately my life can be summed up in one word right 
now...WORK.  I think my other group members are trying to kill me this 
month.  We have a group of three people and at least two have to be here each 
day.  Well, I have to work a double shift to cover for someone all but one 
week this month.  So that's pretty much all I have time to do now.  In fact 
I'm headed home pretty soon to take a nap before my next shift this 
afternoon.  That is the one bonus of this split shift day.  

Let me know how you're doing when you get a chance.  

Robin
