Subject: Book Request

Nancy,

Here's the book request I spoke with you about.   This also needs to be added 
to the AGG-GAS, AGG-GASIII, AND AGG-GASIV portfolios.  Please include as a 
separate portfolio named trader under the Lavorato Other region.  

Please let me know when this book is set up.

Thanks,
Robin
