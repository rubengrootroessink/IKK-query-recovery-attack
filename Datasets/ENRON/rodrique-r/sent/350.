So are you thinking going to dinner or something else?  I need to know if you 
just can decide on a resturant or you can decide on what to do?  And if you 
want to do something other than eat you need to let me know.  

We could just curl up in front of the fireplace...oh wait neither of us have 
a fireplace.  Guess we'll have to think of something else.
