I thought you'd appreciate this email from my brother.  It's the best family 
email I've gotten lately.  I'm such a great sister...I bought the present, 
wrapped the present (or at least watched while the clerk wrapped it), and 
delivered it to my mom for her birthday, and I was nice enough to put my 
brother's name on the gift.
