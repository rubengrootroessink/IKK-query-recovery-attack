1.  I have learned how to prepare the NGP&L.

2.  I have gained an understanding of the originations process in order to 
properly represent originations on the NGP&L.

3.  I have learned how to prepare the Benchmark.

4.  I have reduced the time spent at night running the Basis reports by 
consolidating the Shankman, Fletch, and Lavorato reports into one file so 
that the information                need only be queried once.  This was 
accomplished by creating multiple Date Bucket designations in a single file.  

5.  I updated the Greg Pos. Report, so that it ties to the Benchmark in total 
and reflects the Lavorato time buckets.

6.  I updated the Gas Detail Tab of the Benchmark to include new books that 
have been added to the Benchmark.  This enabled me to tie the Greg Pos Report 
to the Benchmark.

7.  I created an additional section of the Gas Detail Tab to calculate the 
fixed price positions.  This section is used to report the total fixed price 
position by seasonal buckets on the Lavorato Basis report.  

I have not included any accomplishments from my former group.  If you would 
like to see them also please let me know.

Thanks,
Robin
