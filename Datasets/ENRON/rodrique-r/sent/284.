Hey,

What's going on?  I've had a fabulous day...at least it hasn't been boring.  
Anything interesting in your world?  

It's the first night and I already want to skip my GMAT class.  I may come 
visit you before I go to my class.  I don't want to hang around down here 
until 6.   That is if you aren't too busy today.  

Talk to ya later,
Robin
