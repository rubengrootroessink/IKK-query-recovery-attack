I think this is a good chance to get back on our Monday schedule.  Not that I 
don't want to have Spanish, but.....  If we didn't have Spanish you and I 
could go to lunch.

That was the whole purpose of it, so maybe you'll change your mind and stay 
(he he). No honestly, have lots of fun. We'll talk later. I still need to 
think if we are going to have Spanish or not. Fridays and Spanish don't get 
along.
