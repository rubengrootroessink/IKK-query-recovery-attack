I'd like to be there around 7 if that's when it starts.  But we probably 
don't need to leave here until 6:30-6:45ish.  Just call me before you go to 
class and let me know when you'll get out and I'll meet you downstairs.  

I'm probably going to leave around 3:30 if things stay this calm.

Bye
RR
