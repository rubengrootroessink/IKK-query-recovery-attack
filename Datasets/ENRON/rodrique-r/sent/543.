It's unfortunate that the markets will be open right after Thanksgiving and 
Christmas but they will be (bidweek).  I need to know who will be around 
during those times to help keep the ship sailing.  Now, I will try to 
accomodate all requests for vacation time but I may not be able to let you 
off.  Please let me know soon.

Dave
