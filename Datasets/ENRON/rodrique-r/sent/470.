Time spent actually typing, procrastinating, or staring blankly into space??  
I spent the most of the morning Wed. on evaluations.  Of course I had five to 
do and plenty of little tasks thrown in the middle.  So it probably took me 
about 20 minutes per evaluation.  Some I had to think about a little harder 
than others.  It all depends on how many comments you write.  Mine took me 
the longest and I'm still not happy with it.  

Have fun bowling.  I'd love to see your shirt!!
Robin

I promise I won't bug you again.  I just need to plan ahead. How long did it 
take you to finish PEP (avg. time spent  per person)?
