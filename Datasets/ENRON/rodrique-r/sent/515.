Yeah, but you know I can't resist an opportunity to make a sarcastic remark.

See now I think you should stay with risk. Yeahh.I think you are better off 
there. he he he. You know this means that if you go to EBS our stock can 
actually go down. No, what it really means is that I might have to help the 
new person if you are really busy. Personally I do not like the idea.  

Ok, I'll ask Ibrahim about this friend of his.  

As for golf practice, we'll see if the weather turns out to be ok. I'll send 
you an email once I know this guy's name, ok?

I was asking what you thought about  the whole EBS thing, not about my 
nervousness. 

Gabriel
