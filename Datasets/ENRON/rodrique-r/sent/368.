Just hoping I guess.   B/c mom already told me I wasn't getting anything from 
them, and I haven't picked out anything from the Grandmas, so even if I do 
get something it just means I'm going to have to find some corner of the 
closet to hide it in!!  How was that for a run on sentence!  I'm not sure I 
believe we're going to have sleet here tomorrow.  It's still hot and muggy 
outside now.

Talk to ya later,
Robin
