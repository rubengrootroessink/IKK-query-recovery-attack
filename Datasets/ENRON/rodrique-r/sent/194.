You're right...that sounds just like Becky.  At least no one's sick this 
time!!  I can't believe Zach ran the car into the house.  And equally amazing 
is that Emily finally finished high school.  

I still haven't heard anything about Chicago.  I finally got the name of the 
HR rep here in Houston, so I'm going to begin the irritation tactic shortly.  
I'll just call every few minutes until they get tired of hearing their phone 
ring and finally answer.  And if that doesn't work I know where this lady's 
office is so I'll go pay her a friendly visit.  I'm determined to find 
something out.  

Talk to ya later,
Robin

Hey, 
I thought you might enjoy reading this if you have a few minutes to spare.  
It's from Becky, and it sounds just like her.  I thought you might get a kick 
out of what we are missing around there.  

Enjoyed lunch the other day.  We'll do it again sometime.  
Did you find out anything else about going to Chicago?  Keep me updated.

Later,
JoAnne

Hey yourself,
Glad you've gotten to work and have gotten settled.  Of course, now you're
one of the working class.....sounds like you're gonna be busy.  We have been
here-if anything, we're busier than ever.  The auditors are
here ---yuck...and will be til the end of the year probably.  Oh well,
nothing to hide.
Emily is enrolled here-can you believe it?  and Zach decided to help out by
cranking my truck last week.  Emily had left it in gear so now my utility
room has a large opening in it that was not previously there.  He was used
to cranking his dad's automatic car and  boy, did he get a surprise...Oh
well, he's not hurt and the truck and utility room can be fixed.
Had a birthday yesterday.  Jake took me to the Warehouse last night and I
stuffed my face.  Really good.  Seems like you had one a few weeks ago,
yourself.  Happy belated birthday.  Hope it was a good one.  Sounds like
things are going great for you two-buying a house and everything.  Where is
Shannon working?  Is he having to drive far to get to work?
Guess I better get some of this junk rounded up.  Maybe he'll let us go a
few minutes early.  I could handle that...some of my birthday money is going
for a massage in an hour or so...Let us hear from you...send me your address
and I'll add you to my book..
Bye for now, tell Robin hi for me and you keep in touch also.

Becky
