I think harassing me is a very popular pass time around here.

hey, not much here.  None of my bosses are here, however, Tim left me some 
work to do and I am having a hard time comparing my results to what the 
analysts say they should be.  Tim would be disappointed if this is not 
finished by tomorrow. At least that is what I think, so I am keeping myself 
busy.  I have time to check my e-mail though, so keep writing.   For example, 
you can lie to me about how beautiful Lake Charles is, oopsss.  I think Jeff 
enjoys harassing you very very much. 

Anyways, if you find something interesting to tell me, let me know.
