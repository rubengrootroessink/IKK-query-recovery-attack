Yeah, I'm still here.  Still trying to tie out the basis.  I'll let you 
know.  I'm beginning to think I'll just tell them I haven't accomplished 
anything and be done with it.  There's no chance I'll get promoted 
anyway...my PRC rep doesn't even know I'm a girl.  In the email he sent 
Gossett he kept saying summarize "his" accomplishments, and "his" strengths, 
etc.  Goss thought it was hilarious.

I'll let you know how everything's going, or I'll call you when I leave.
