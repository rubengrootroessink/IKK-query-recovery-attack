How much did you pay for your clubs?  By the way, I thought using company 
email was a nice touch.  We were named one of the top 100 companies to work 
for...number 24 to be exact.  They are pushing for #1 next year.   I think 
it's the Analyst program that's holding them back right now!!!  

Well back to pretending to work.  Right now I'm training and there's nothing 
to do in the middle of the day with this job, so there are two of us trying 
to stay busy doing nothing right now!  

Later,
RR
