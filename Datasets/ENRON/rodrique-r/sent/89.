Hey Richard,

I think we've finally gotten an answer out of the analyst program.  I'm just 
waiting on the paper work now.  I spoke to Laura yesterday about a possible 
March 12th start date.  Let me know if that date's okay for you.  

I'll let you know if anything changes.

Robin

What's going on?  I haven't heard from you in awhile.  Laura indicated to me 
that she was able to do something with the analyst program to hopefully solve 
your cost of living issue.  We would still love to have you in Chicago.  Let 
me know what you are thinking.

You may have told Laura, but I haven't spoken to her much in the last couple 
of weeks and we were all wondering up here in Chicago.

Richard
