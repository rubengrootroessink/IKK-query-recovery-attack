I wish you would have sent me this BEFORE I ran into her today.  I had no 
idea if you'd talked to her or not so I wasn't going to say anything and make 
her made at you.  Anyway, I guess she's going to be good at keeping in quiet 
b/c I didn't know if she knew or not.  And as for the admitting in front of 
other people, I did tell you about this.  She asked me if you had left for 
Austin yet and I said no.  And then someone asked me what I was doing for the 
weekend and I said I was going Christmas shopping in San Marcos.  No mention 
of you or Austin.   Oh well, I guess we'll see how long the "secret" lasts.  
Was she mad at you?

Talk to ya later,
Robin
