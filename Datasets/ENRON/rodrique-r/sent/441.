Brooklyn,

What's going on?  How was your holiday?  I thought about you this weekend.  
We had fried turkey.  It was sooo yummy.  I was going to bring you some, but 
there weren't even crums left.  

Well, I just wanted to brag.  So I'll leave you alone.

By the way, how was your trip to Kinder?  Did you have trouble finding the 
hotel or resturant?

Later,
Robin
