So what you're telling me is that you're intentionally trying to bait me.  
Apparently you haven't figured out yet that it can be hazardous to your 
health to make me mad!!  And I know you well enough to know that my last 
statement will only serve as a challenge to you.  You're going to spend the 
rest of the day trying to irritate me.  Don't deny it.  I know you too well.  
So where are we going to watch the game?  If I understood soccer a little 
better I'd be more involved in the trash-talking.  But I'll just leave it at 
this...the US could kick Mexico's butt at anything!!  Mexican men can't even 
knock down an American girl even when they are given 13 whole seconds to 
try!!  How could you possibly expect a group of these weaklings to beat a 
group of top quality American athletes.

Bye.

PS Have fun in all those meetings.  Pretty soon you'll be going to more than 
Gossett.

Oohhh that one, it was cancelled.  I am becoming more bureaucratic now, so I 
had a meeting at 10:00 with Treasury, then I was supposed to have this one at 
1:00 and there is another one with Corporate Finance at 2:30.  To tell you 
the truth, the one at 10:00 I was clueless and then I found out I was the one 
that was supposed to kind of give all the information. (information I of 
course did not know). It was a good learning experience because we called 
somebody else that I told them had the information.   

Thanks for asking.  I am getting ready and pumped up because I think today at 
6:30 we are going to kick some gringo butt.  What do you think?  You need to 
get upset, because otherwise this is not going to be fun.
