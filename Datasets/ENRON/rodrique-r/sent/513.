Sorry to hear about your airport travels.  Has Alejandra found a place to 
live yet?  When is she starting on the east desk...they need help!!  They 
screwed their position up again today.  

My weekend was really good.  Of course it could have been better without the 
rain.  Saturday my friend and I sat around and gossiped most of the afternoon 
and then went out to eat and to a movie.  Then Sunday we went to visit some 
friends of ours in Sugarland that just had a baby.  So we spent most of 
Sunday afternoon playing with the baby.  The dad is hilarious.  He's the type 
that seems really quite but when he says something he just cracks you up.  He 
was talking about the baby monitors they got.  He said he was going to put a 
message on it that said, "Hi, Brianna.  This is your parents.  We aren't 
available right now, but it you leave a message we'll get back to you."  

Are we having Spanish class today?  

Robin

PS My forearms are a little sore, but that's all.

  Rest of Saturday was good I went out with some friends to this place I 
really like. However, Sunday was  not so good. I went to IAH (airport) twice. 
So, that was almost like going to Austin, plus on the way back rain was very 
very bad (The 10:30 pm. rain).  For the second time, Alejandra's plane was 
delayed, but this time it was more than 5 hours delayed. She got stuck in 
Dallas and of course I knew once I was already at IAH.  How about you? 
Hey, My right shoulder is a little sore (Golf). Is your's sore? or am I just 
a little rusty.

Gabriel
