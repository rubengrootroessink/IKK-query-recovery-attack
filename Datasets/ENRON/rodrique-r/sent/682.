 Virendra,

Let me know when you are available to discuss the Gas Daily GRMS logic.  It 
is my understanding that GRMS currently will only include those gas daily 
deals that are intramonth deals with an effective date greater than the 
current date.  However, we should also include any deals in out months that 
are fixed price gas daily deals.  

Thanks,
Robin
