These are revised schedules for Jan, Mar, &  Apr 2000 and the estimate 
(scheduled) volumes for May.
The prices were revised to capture Texas General storage revenue (fuel 
retention) in Jan, Mar, & Apr.  The fuel volumes are shown as a zero buy 
price for the storage book.
The April also has volume true-ups due to actual metered volumes. (Schedule 
6).  Another adjustment was made in April to true up the cumulative facility 
balance, (4,295 mmbtu).

Thanks,
Kenny
