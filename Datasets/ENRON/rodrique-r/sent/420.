Unfortunately I'm afraid that your last estimate is probably the most 
realistic.  Today is my favorite day of the month...we're rolling everything 
today!!!  Let me  rephrase that I'M rolling everything tonight.  Maybe that 
way I won't have to reroll it in the morning!!

Let me rewind.... HI, Good Morning, ready for a full  10 hour shift? Knowing 
how things are down there, you might just be starting your day. Ready for 
another 10-11 hours??
