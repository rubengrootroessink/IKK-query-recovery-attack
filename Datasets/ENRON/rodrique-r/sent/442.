Sorry to hear you're being hazed today.  I'm glad to know he thinks you are 
worth something.  You can be pretty certain I won't be coming to join your 
new group when I rotate.  I think I'm going to rotate to the Controls group 
so I don't have to do anything.

Yeah, I was way too excited to sleep last night.  Just thinking about all the 
fun I'd have this week.  Oh, here a highlight for your day.  I was excited 
today b/c I'd only have to work one shift this week.  I forgot Binh has today 
off too.  She won't be back until tomorrow, so I have another two shift 
day...YUCK!!!  And to top it off Irena just came by with the December 
calendar.  Binh has a week off and Rock has the last week of Dec through the 
first week of Jan off.  I'm sooo excited.  

Enough whining for now.  Are we having Spanish class today?

Bye-bye.
Robin

I am glad everything is fine on your side.  I am sorry you did not get much 
sleep.  It is a mistery why sometimes you have those nights where you wake up 
looking at the clock. I am sure your problem was due to your  excitement to 
come back to work. You could not wait any longer. Well, I am definitely not 
glad... the hazing started again, and I think it doubled.  If we look at it 
in an optimistic way, having me do these exercises that are really hard mean 
his expectations have not been lowered.  He still thinks I am worth 
something. 

Talk to you later. I am being subdued right now.

Gabriel

What...A tax book not helpful?  Aren't you glad you didn't have to suffer 
through that class?  Everything went fine this morning.  I just had to 
rebuild the bench and the basis report but that's all!!  Lavo seemed happy 
with everything this morning.  No screaming anyway.   And no I didn't get 
much sleep last night, but it wasn't really your fault.  Even after I went to 
bed I just kept waking up.  It was one of those nights where you wake up and 
look at the clock at least once every hour.  I feel a little dazed but other 
than that I'm okay.

And no I'm not glad to be back at work.  Are you?

Talk to ya later,
Robin

Hi!
How is it possible that my Financial Statement Analysis book was more helpful 
than your Tax book as far as how to handle NOL accounts?
It was not even worth carrying that heavy book. Just kidding, thank you very 
much anyways.  Was everything ok this morning?

I felt bad I left really late last night. I hope you got some good rest. 
Glad you are back at work?

Gabriel
