So all those West Virginia stereotypes are true after all!!!  I think all my 
family has their own teeth.  Even my grandparents have their own teeth.  You 
know I always thought I had good family stories, but you definitely outrank 
me there.  

Have a good weekend. 
Robin

Something else weird about my sister and her daughter ( the ones who live in 
the sticks in W.Va.).  They both had all of their teeth pulled and then got 
dentures.  Janey is 46 and Missy is 24 years old.  Isn't that icky?  Missy 
told me that she liked her dentures because her teeth no longer hurt!  And my 
sister, I hate to admit this, says she likes them because she can take them 
out and clean them every few days!  Dang!  If they had used good, or even 
fair, hygiene then they could still have their real teeth.  So, brush, brush, 
brush.
Now that you have picked yourself up off of the floor, stop laughing!
Do you have a family story to top this one?  Hope not.
Becky
