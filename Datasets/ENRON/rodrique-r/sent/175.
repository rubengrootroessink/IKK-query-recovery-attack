Guess what I found out this morning.   It looks like I'll be rotating out of 
this job just in time.  Jeff said Louise Kitchen is just like Shankman.  
Yikes...  We've (Jeff and I) not to tell Binh anything about her.  Lavo 
stresses her out, so I don't think she'd take the job if she knows it's only 
going to get worse!!
