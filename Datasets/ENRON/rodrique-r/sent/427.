Debbie,

Thank you for returning my call.  I went to the eRequest to submit a request 
for Risktrac but the only option was to get access to the application.  I 
already have the application I merely need access to the VAR module.  
Therefore, I did not submit an eRequest.  Please let me know what I need to 
submit to ensure I get the proper access.

Thank you,
Robin
