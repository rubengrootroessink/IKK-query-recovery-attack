Read what you wrote sometime when your not so tired, and let me know if you 
understood it....b/c I sure didn't!!  I have no idea what you're trying to 
say.  So just imagine me nodding my head and smiling politely.

Either they have spare time or they are doing it in their sleep.  I really 
don't want to think of anyone I know here working on having babies.  I say 
that and yet I know Tracy is trying to get pg.  She says she is tired of 
always having her legs in the air.  I know she doesn't have any spare time.  
Maybe she utilizes her time by doing two things at once.  Like eating dinner 
and you know...... Or like, heck I don't know.  My brain is mush.  See ya.  B

Are you here yet?
There are thousands of kids here today.  They are in every nook and cranny.  
Dang, I'll be glad to get out of here today.  Are there thousands of kids on 
your floor too?  We now know what Enron employees do in their spare time!!  B
