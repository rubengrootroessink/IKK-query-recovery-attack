Hey,

I checked out the Houston Chronicle website and there were two Preludes that 
would be comparable to mine.  One was advertised for $21,995(which is the 
blue book) and the other was advertised for $18,900ish.  Of course both were 
being sold by dealers, so I probably couldn't get quite that much.  But I can 
probably get enough to make it worthwhile to go ahead and sell my car.  I 
just wonder how long it would take before it actually sold.  

That's what I've accomplished since lunch.  Talk to ya later,
Robin
