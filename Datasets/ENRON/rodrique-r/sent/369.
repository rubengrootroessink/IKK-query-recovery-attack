Before you go mail me your house keys and tell me where you've hidden my 
Christmas presents.  Sorry we won't get to see you for Christmas.  Hope you 
like Chicago.  Maybe you'll make it back by Easter.  

Ruston was good.  The game was awesome!!  It was so loud in there my ears 
were ringing when I left.  We lost but it was a much closer game than I 
expected.  My favorite part was when Pat Summitt was whining and the crowd 
starting chanting "Sit down, Pat!" 

Keith and Susan was crazy as usual.  I had a blast over there.  

Talk to ya later.  Good luck with your trip.

So how is Ruston? Anything exciting going on?

I'm heading to Chicogo this week. (St. Charles
actually) I'm hoping that I will even make it. The
weather is so bad up there that they are cancelling
flights now. And what am I supposed to do once I'm
there? Do you think that this poor little Texas boy
has ice and snow clothes? What use would I have for a
wool coat down here. I'm going to freeze my tushy off.
