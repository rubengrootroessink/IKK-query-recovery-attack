Jeff,

I took care of the Executive Viewer.  I talked to Frank and apparently 
Lavorato wants to see the Canadian breakout next week.  I already have 
everything set up to do the positions, but we need to work on Canada to get 
the P&L.  Intra-Canada has a breakout but it's only in Canadian dollars.  I 
left a message for Kathy to call me.  Just wanted to give you a heads up.

Talk to you Monday.
Robin

My management line is hidden on my hard copy report but not on the executive 
viewer.  Make sure its hidden on the executive viewer.
