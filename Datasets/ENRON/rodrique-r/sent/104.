I'm now trained to avoid harrassment.   Actually it wasn't as bad as I 
thought it'd be...not that it was exactly interesting, but it could have been 
much worse.  I was going to leave, but I just found out that Laura's in 
Houston.  Not only is she in Houston, she's in a conference room on this 
floor.  I keep peeking in the window to see if she's still in there.  I'm 
just hanging around now hoping to get a chance to talk to her.  

Talk to ya later.
