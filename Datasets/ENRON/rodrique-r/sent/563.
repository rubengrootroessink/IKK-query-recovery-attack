I'm hoping they have good movies on the flight!  But I'm also bringing a good 
book, and I'll probably bring a pair of headphones...even if I don't plug 
them into anything.  I think I'll have them as a decoy in case I end up with 
an annoying neighbor for the flight.  Everyone around me knows my travel 
plans as well as I do.  I think I must have become a little annoying myself.  

Well back to work.  

Talk to ya later,
Robin
