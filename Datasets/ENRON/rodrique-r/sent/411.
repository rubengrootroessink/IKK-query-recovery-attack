Gossett officially asked me for my accomplishments today.  I have to have 
them done by tomorrow night.  So I guess that's what I'll be doing the rest 
of the day(not that I've had that many accomplishments just that it'll take 
me that long to think of something.)  I knew I might as well add that last 
crack b/c if I didn't you would have!
