As an update on Canada, I replied to Kathy's email and told her we weren't 
going to change 2000.  So she fired off an email to Jeff and made him mad.  I 
told him they wouldn't listen to me and his comment was "They'll listen to 
Sally."  Hehehe.  We'll see, but I'm not convinced that Canada will listen to 
anyone.
