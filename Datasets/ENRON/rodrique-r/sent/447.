No Problem.  One question though, why are we taking Enovate out of Agg-gas?

Robin,
Don't make the changes to the portfolios yet. We have been looking at these 
books already- for we need to actually take Enovate out of Agg-gas IV as 
opposed to adding it in Agg-Gas...
Lets talk about it before we add these books!
Thanks,
Bilal
