I definitely want them.  We had several questions last month about why some 
curves where included where they were.  So it'd be nice to be able to blame 
someone else!  How's your day going?  How long did it take you to get up the 
elevator?  I made it in before the crowd backed up.  But apparently one of 
the elevators got stuck.  You know Dave Delainey's admin, Beverely.  She said 
she was stuck in the elevator for about 45 minutes this morning!!  She didn't 
seem too excited about it either.

Talk to ya later,
Robin
PS I think I'm going to take a nap for lunch today...for some reason I'm 
sleepy this morning.

Hey,  I have the original list of physical curves for the basis report that 
we divided up in  East, West, Central and Canada.  Remeber? It is the one 
that Gossett helped us divide into all these regions.  I also have the one 
where all the desk leads wrote their physical curves on.  If you want them 
I'll keep them, if not, they will be autodestroyed in 5 seconds.
