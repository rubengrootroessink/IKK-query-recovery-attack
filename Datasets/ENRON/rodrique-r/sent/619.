Me bored??  I think you must be more bored than me to talk about ear 
cleaning.  There's this new person that sits down the row from me and she 
baby talks...what's up with that!  It's so irritating.  Well now that I've 
gossipped about someone 10ft from me I better send this email before someone 
walks by and reads it.  I think I'll skip the run this week.
