Sorry I missed you guys for lunch yesterday.  I didn't get your email until 
yesterday afternoon.  I've been in class for two days...Derivatives I.  It's 
really hard to sit still and think about swaps and options when I'd rather 
think about Sydney!  But I guess it's better than being at my desk all day.  
The days are pretty slow.  It doesn't really get busy here until 3:30 or so.  

Bye,
Robin

PS If I forget my bras, I'm just not going to bother!!
