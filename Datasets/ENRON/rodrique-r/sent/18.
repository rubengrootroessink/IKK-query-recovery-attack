Yes I did get an apartment.  They are still doing some renovations, so I'll 
probably be in a hotel for a few days.  The owner said he would try to have 
it by the 12th, but you know how that goes.  I should be able to move in no 
later than the 16th though so that's not too bad.  If you could recommend a 
hotel I'd appreciate it.  

Thanks,
Robin

The garage we park in is full, I am waiting to hear back from 2 others.  I 
will let you know as soon as I find out.  Did you find an apartment?
