My day sucks so far...how about yours?  I caught a million dollar mistake 
this morning and was feeling pretty proud of myself.  That is until John 
called and said there's something wrong with the P&L.  It was only an $87 
million mistake.  I don't know what the big deal was.  Anyway, things are 
calming down a little now.  I'm just still irritated.  That mistake was 
something I should have caught.  Oh well I'm leaving soon.  

That's enough whining.  So what are you up to today?  I'm looking forward to 
actually being able to go home at a decent time today and having nothing that 
has to be done tonight.  I'm just going to kick back and watch TV.  I might 
call Ragini and Sabina and see if they want to come over for king cake.  
You'll be invited too of course.  

I'm starving.  Do you have any calzones this morning?

Talk to ya later
Robin
