Nancy,

I've discovered a basis book with the attribute problem we corrected for the 
Physical book below.  INTRA-EMWNSS1-BAS was set up to replace IM-EMWNSS1-BAS 
for credit purposes.  However, the correct region code is still being applied 
to the old book.  Here's what I need to happen.

BOOK ID   CURRENT REGION CODE  CORRECT REGION CODE

INTRA-EMWNSS1-BAS MIDWEST    MDWEST

IM-EMWNSS1-BAS  MDWEST    MDWEST_OLD (This region code really doesn't matter 
as long as it does not                               duplicate a currently 
used region code.)

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks for your help,
Robin

Nancy,

The new attributes you have assigned to the IM-EMWNSS2-PHY  book are 
duplicating the attributes of the INTRA-EMWNSS1-PHY book.  Per my original 
request please change the region code for IM-EMWNSS2-PHY to Midwest_Old, 
since it is my understanding from Burton that this book should no longer be 
used.

If you have any more questions, give me a call.
Robin

Robin:

Per your request, the attributes on FT-IM-ENOV-PHY have been changed as 
follows



	Portfolio Code	Book Code	Book Type	Book Flag	Commodity	Region Code
OLD ATTRIBUTES	1	E	M	P	NG	MIDWEST
NEW ATTRIBUTES	P	A	M	P	NG	MIDWEST

In order to prevent duplicate book attributes,  IM-EMWNSS2-PHY attributes 
were also changed as follows:


	Portfolio Code	Book Code	Book Type	Book Flag	Commodity	Region Code
OLD ATTRIBUTES	P	A	M	P	NG	MIDWEST
NEW ATTRIBUTES	P	A	M	P	NG	MIDWEST1

These changes will properly report the ERMS positions in the FT-IM-ENOV-PHY 
book as apposed to IM-EMWNSS2-PHY, which should have no positions.


If you have any questions, please call me at ext 54751


Nancy
