Hey,

How's your day going?  Mine's been really good...I probably shouldn't have 
said that.  I've actually felt like I'm accomplishing something today.  Isn't 
that novel?  We have Treebeard's for lunch today, YUCK.  It was actually 
pretty funny.  We weren't supposed to have food today, but the Treebeards 
delivered for the traders on the wrong day, so we get a free lunch.  

What are you doing for lunch?  I don't think I can handle Treebeards, so I 
was thinking of going to Subway.  Wanna go?

Bye.
Robin
