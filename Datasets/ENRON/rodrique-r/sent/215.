Of course I remember you...I'm not that much of a flake.  How long have you 
been back in Houston?  I actually saw you fighting the elevator crowd in the 
lobby several days ago.  We should definitely get together.  Do you have 
lunch plans for today?  

Robin

Hey Robin,
It's been a while since I have talked with or seen you.  In case you forgot, 
we worked together at LA Tech for Becky.  I am back permanently now as a tax 
analyst.  I am in the rotation program and am working in 3AC for what used to 
be EI for my first rotation.  I thought maybe we could get together sometime, 
go to lunch, and chat.  I would love to hear from you.

JoAnne
