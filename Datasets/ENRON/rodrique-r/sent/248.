Chris,

Below Wei explains what the option class cd column should contain. Please fix 
this error before saving the file out tonight.  If you have any questions let 
me know.

Thanks,
Robin

Robin,

I have set it up for this spreadsheet and I already ran it in stage 
database.  The only error message I got was 'OPT_CLASS_CD INVALID'.  
Option_class_cd should be one of the following: 'AMR', 'ASI', 'ASM', and 
'EUR'.  'USD' in the spreadsheet is more like a currency_cd.

Wei
