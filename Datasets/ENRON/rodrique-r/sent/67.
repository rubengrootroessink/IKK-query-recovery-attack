Mac&Cheese huh?  Eating a light lunch?  When I was at Tech I complained about 
the food one day (well actually I complained a lot, but one day I made an 
official complaint).  Anyway I was telling the guy over the food service that 
the food was overpriced and the quality was pathetic.  And he told me they 
were actually losing money.  All I had to say to that was if you can charge 
$6.50 for Beanie Weenies (actual price of an actual dish passed off as an 
entree)  and lose money you must be the worst businessman in the history of 
the world.  I don't think he appreiciated me sharing my opinion with him.
