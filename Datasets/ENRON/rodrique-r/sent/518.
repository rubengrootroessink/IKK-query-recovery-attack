What do I think about what...the fact that you're now the one that's a little 
stressed?  I think that's kind of funny!!  Just kidding.  I have a friend 
coming in town this weekend, but she's not coming until sometime Sat. 
afternoon probably around 3-4ish.  So if you want to go to the driving range 
around noonish on Sat. we could do that.  Although I think it's supposed to 
rain all weekend so we might just end up back at the movies.  

As for the rotation, I wouldn't exactly say I know Brian but I met him at the 
Morton's dinner.   I guess I'd be as well off starting with him as to call 
Ibrahim's friend, since I don't know Ibrahim or his friend.  Well actually, I 
might know Ibrahim's friend.  Ask Ibrahim his friend's name and if I don't 
know him I'll call Brian on Monday and see exactly what it is that they do.  
Thanks for the help with this.  

Talk to ya later,
Robin

Well, We can go different routes. Do you know Brian Hoskins?  If not, I know 
him well. Well, he works in that group. He can tell us what it is about. The 
last time I talked to him, he did mention something about customers (big 
customers); but honestly I am not sure exactly what it is. Then what we can 
do is ask Ibrahim the name of his friend. We'll ask Brian if he knows him ( 
Brian, by the way, loves to help people. but only good people : ( 
 and we can go from there. 

If not, we can just go trhough Ibrahim. Once that is done, We'll figure what 
to tell Gossett (ouchhhh) . Uppsss, I do not want any oart during this stage. 
He will probably kill me if he knows I told you about this group.

Ibrahim is leaving next week. He had told me that he was going to stay about 
3 more weeks, but his new group wants him. Uppsss  I feel I have SOOOOO Much 
to learn. I really feel behind. There will be a lot of reading this weekend 
but of course I might take a break and go to the drive range if you want to 
go. You never responded me. Ok, ok, maybe you do not want to go. I'll go on 
my own and hit the ball with my tennis raquet.

Anyways. who said there was no stress level here. I am getting kind of 
nervous because it is a little complicated.  Tell me what you think. 

Gabriel
