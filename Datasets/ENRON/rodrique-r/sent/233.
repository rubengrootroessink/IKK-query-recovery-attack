Lynn,

I spoke with Laura Luce on Friday, and she asked me to coordinate with you to 
arrange a visit to the Chicago office.  We tentatively discussed scheduling 
my visit for Friday January 26 to Monday Jan 29.  Please let me know if these 
dates are still convenient and who I need to contact to make all the 
necessary arrangements.

Thank you for your help,
Robin
