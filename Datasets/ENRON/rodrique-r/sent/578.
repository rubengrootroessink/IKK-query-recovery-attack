Yeah,my family's pretty entertaining!!  I went home last weekend for my mom's 
birthday.  We had all gone somewhere and when we were about to turn the 
corner on our street we were all praying and holding our breath hoping my 
grandmother wasn't at our house!!  She's been driving my mother crazy (it's 
my dad's mom by the way).  She's now determined that there's something 
terribly wrong with her.  She has a doctor's appt this week and says she's 
going to convince the dr to send her to the diagnostic center of houston.  My 
dad informed me that she told him she'd just fly here...so I'm guessing she 
actually thinks I'm going to take off work for a week to shuttle her back and 
forth to the dr.   She's wrong of course!  

Well enough rambling for now.  If I get any good family emails I'll let you 
know!
