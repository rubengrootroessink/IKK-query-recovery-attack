The gas group stopped publishing it to the website, but I am not sure if they 
use the info for other purposes.  Maybe Robin or David can respond to that 
issue.

Chris, most of the remaining people on the distribution list are EES 
management.  Does Corp no longer require the Basis position report to be 
prepared daily?  If so, we will no longer send it.

Thanks,
MYH

You can take Michael Benien and myself off of the list, as we no longer use 
this report.   Additionally, you should remove Rahmaan Mwongozi and Gabriel 
Monroy as they no longer work in the gas group.  You might want to check with 
the others to see if the report needs to continue going to them also.

Thanks,
Chris
