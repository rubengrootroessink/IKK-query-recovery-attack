Each Weather Forecast Used Within the Volatility Matrix    Day 1-5 Discussi=
on:   There is still no true arctic air in the pattern, but the Southern je=
t stream is active for storms and the trend is certainly colder than recent=
 weeks.   We have seen a definitive change in the weather pattern from last=
 month. January on the whole featured the strong ridge and unseasonable war=
mth in the Eastern U.S. while the West had a trough and occasional record b=
reaking cold. If you smooth out the maps, we will see in general a reversal=
 over the next two weeks with a trough in the East and Ridge in the West. I=
 still don't see any highlight making cold with this trough, but a "cold an=
d stormy" projection does not seem unreasonable for the East. We have this =
morning a storm in the South that will bring snow to Oklahoma and NW Texas =
today with rain farther South. It will track towards the SE U.S. coast thro=
ugh Th! ursday then appears to move out to sea. The Interior SE may see som=
e light to moderate snow with this, but otherwise will be a rainmaker. This=
 should be the most significant weather maker in the short term. The coldes=
t of the air in the short term covers the Eastern U.S. right now. This shou=
ld start modifying although only in a gradual sense through the rest of the=
 week.    Tomorrow: Wednesday, February  6, 2002   Syncrasy's Choice:  Delt=

latility Matrix    Day 6-10 Discussion:  The same threats and questions rai=
sed yesterday in the 6-10 day outlook still apply today. The Canadian and E=
uropean schemes still look sharper with the western ridge and eastern troug=
h than their American counterpart. The correct forecast up to now most of t=
he time was to go with the warmer solution. This time I am running with the=
 colder one. The Canadian model has been consistent with a stronger Eastern=
 trough since the middle of last week. It brings a moderate batch of arctic=
 air next week into the Eastern U.S. The potential of some sort of East coa=
st storm also remains in this pattern. I am not by any means forecasting an=
y brutal cold, but I am going against yesterdays NWS 6-10 and 8-4 day outlo=
oks which are above normal in the Eastern U.S. I believe most of the region=
 will grade out slightly below normal instead while th! e West is in a mode=
rating phase.      Day 6: Sunday, February 10, 2002  Click Here  for Syncra=
