y Matrix    Day 6-10 Discussion:  The 6-10 day period looks chilly, but har=
dly cold and also may be very quiet. The SE ridge is replaced by a trough i=
n the means so we should not see the recent spring regime. The trend over t=
he Western part of the continent ( US and Canada) is for Pacific zonal flow=
. The real bitter cold that has been in Canada the last several weeks shoul=
d gradually modify. We will likely see two distinct branches in the jet str=
eam, an arctic branch in the North and subtropical branch in the South. We =
get our big storms and bitter cold outbreaks when they phase(come together)=
. Most of the extreme forecasts you see come together when this phasing occ=
urs. I can not rule it out in the future, but it looks unlikely to me for n=
ow. To me, the bottom line for this period(and beyond)is for a slight cold =
bias East and a close to normal look elsewhere.!      Day 6: Saturday, Febr=
