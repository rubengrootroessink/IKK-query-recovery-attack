ussion:   A major winter storm will pound the Plains, Lakes and New England=
 the next couple of days. Medium range models now suggest this may NOT be w=
inters final gasp.   I don't believe I hype storms as much as many forecast=
ers, but the current storm now forming in the Plains deserves some attentio=
n. Some serious snow and ice accumulations are possible from Oklahoma NE to=
 Wisconsin and eventually to Interior New England. Copious rains will fall =
in the warm sector. This storm should end the recent record warmth in the E=
ast with signs now that it may not return for sometime. One thing that has =
my attention is this current situation is colder than forecasted in the col=
d sector of the storm and thats the first time this winter the models have =
underdone the cold. Until now, its been the other way around. I am not look=
ing for an! ything bitter under a split flow jet stream, but its late Janua=
ry and early February and it can still get cold. Also, the pattern while te=
mporarily taking a break from the storms after this current event looks to =
reload again in the medium range. The short term temperatures still reflect=
 the heat in front of this winter storm, so most of the East is still above=
 normal while the West is below.    Tomorrow: Thursday, January 31, 2002   =

Used Within the Volatility Matrix    Day 6-10 Discussion:  There are severa=
l considerations in the 6-10 day period. First, we could briefly turn on th=
e "Lake Effect" snow machine with a weak Clipper system early next week. Th=
is should not be anywhere near the magnitude of the Buffalo Christmas event=
, but is the first one since then. It drags a moderately cold airmass in be=
hind it. Then, later in the period the Southern jet stream becomes active o=
nce again. Most models show another sizeable winter storm mid to late next =
week and at a farther South latitude than the current one. Now, I dont see =
this 6-10 day period as particularly cold in a relative sense though certai=
nly it will be chillier than recent periods. Numbers may turn out a bit bel=
ow normal especially over the Northern half of the USA. Some of the models =
just past this period suggest a more significant Canadian high woul! d be p=
oised to drop down. The warming of the Canadian prairies does not look as l=
ikely as I have thought over the past few days, so this idea may have some =
merit. If the surface pressures forecast turn out to verify, the ocean indi=
ces(NAO and PNA) switch their signals and we get some snowcover the next 10=
 days from potential storms, then this may all come to pass. It would not b=
e an exaggeration to suggest the coldest air mass of the season could come =
down the second week of February.        Day 6: Monday, February  4, 2002  =
