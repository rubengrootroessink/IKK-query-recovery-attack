d  I started fly fishing two years ago out of what some  would call the bat=
tle of the sexes. I had taken an "old" boyfriend  backpacking; he brought a=
long a fly rod. I think he had just started  fly fishing. I tried it out af=
ter watching him for a while and I  liked it. It reminded me of Tai Chi and=
 meditation - flowing water,  fresh air - it felt so natural.    So when we=
 returned from our trip  I told my boyfriend that I wanted to fly fish. He =
replied,  "You don't know how." Instantly the tomboy in me rose to the  cha=
llenge. Growing up with three brothers, it was a  conditioned response. I h=
ad to prove to this boy that I could  indeed fly fish if I wanted to.  So I=
 said, "I'll  learn." And a few weeks later an old timer in Arizona gave me=
  an old rod, a Reel O'Matic and my first casting lesson. I was  hooked and=
 ready to prove myself to the guys.  With a  good year of fishing under my =
belt, I found myself at the  Santa Ynez River early one morning; no one aro=
und yet, big  pools, bubbling water, a golden eagle cruising up the river, =
 silence. I was fishing a hole with trout and smallmouth bass  in it. All a=
lone, my mind wandered, and I was soon asking  myself whether or not I trul=
y enjoyed fishing, or whether I  was just trying to be better than the boys=
. I contemplated  this thought while casting, the line unrolling rhythmical=
ly on  each forward and back cast. And I felt so very present, in the  now,=
 in peaceful solitude with my world, breathing deep and  then? Fish on!  An=
d the answer was yes. I love this. I  love the way I feel after a day of fi=
shing, as though I had  spent the whole day meditating. I feel fresh and li=
ke a kid  again, all sun-baked and dirty after a day rock hopping up a  cre=
ek. I enjoy most the solitude. Even if I fish with a buddy,  I am still jus=
t with myself, my rod and the cast, trying to  come up with a recipe for ca=
tching that fish. I become so  peaceful fishing. And when I spot that big t=
rout rising across  the stream, the adrenaline rush is crazy. It's amazing =
to me  that I can get so excited about a fish.  I realized that  what had s=
tarted out as me trying to be as good as the guys  had become a practice in=
stead. It is not a battle after all,  but simply fishing: sharing tips, swa=
pping stories, being part  of a community.  I love being a beginner. It mea=
ns I  have years to practice and learn about this thing called fly  fishing=
. And I hope I never lose that beginners mind, because  it is the fuel that=
 pushes me further along and there is  always something new to learn.  BIO =
Kourtney  Morgan works as a sample maker for Patagonia where she began  fly=
 fishing. Reflecting on the sport, she says, "I do so many  things I can't =
say which is my favorite. I will say this, they  all have one thing in comm=
on, I do them with joy and reckless  abandon." [IMAGE]  Photo: Yvon Chouina=
