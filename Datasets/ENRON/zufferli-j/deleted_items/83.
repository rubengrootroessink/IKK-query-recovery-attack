John:

I have IHS listed on the spreadsheet.  It was not in yellow because we are already talking with IHS. 

For nova, oasis and power pool of alberta I had added to the list because I assumed they needed to be addressed I will remove them from the list??

I didn't see accumap added to the new list that was sent by chris behney,

the nova, oasis and power pool of alberta accounts that were added in yellow were inappropriately added as these are 
not data sources that require purchasing, they are simply accounts to set-up much like a membership account
