n:   Pattern has a colder look to it this morning, while the Southern storm=
 track shows signs of action. Eastern ridge gone while arctic air tries to =
reload to the Northwest.   This may be the first time this winter a forecas=
t understates the cold rather than overstates it. Part of it stems from the=
 snowcover in the Plains, but most of it simply did not give the European e=
nough credit for its SE rotation of a Canadian air mass. I do believe its t=
ransient though with some moderation in order by midweek and the five day n=
umbers taken as a whole still are not that cold relative to normal. In many=
 ways, this will be similar to what happened in late December with the larg=
est departures from normal in the South. That will be due more from an acti=
ve storm track rather than any real intrusion of arctic air. Speaking of so=
uth! ern storms, we see rain breaking out across much of Western and Northe=
rn Texas today. This system will bring rain to much of the old South the ne=
xt couple of days. There is some potential for SE coastal development later=
 in the week which could be a Mid-Atlantic snow. But, I am more bullish on =
the next system in the series which could be a big storm over the weekend. =
While its turning colder in the East, often times we see a reversal in the =
West. That does not appear to be the situation in this case. Cold air is tr=
apped in much of the region and the upper level flow is not favorable to sc=
our this out. A gradual moderation may occur, but it still looks below norm=

ty Matrix    Day 6-10 Discussion:  The main stories in the 6-10 day period =
are whether or not the storminess of the European models and the cold showi=
ng up in the Canadian verify. The most extreme solution obviously would be =
a combination of the two, but that seems unlikely given the results of this=
 winter so far. Of the two, I give the storm proposition the most weight. I=
t is possible the East coast could see a sizeable snow out of all of this. =
As for the cold, the Canadian since the middle of last week has been rebuil=
ding pressures in the NW territories. They become quite high this period, b=
ut are still North of the border. It once again becomes a wait and see game=
 to see if some of this real arctic air can come down. That, I am not ready=
 yet to commit to. However, the overall pattern certainly looks colder than=
 January did and for many could run belo! w normal this period.    Day 6: S=
