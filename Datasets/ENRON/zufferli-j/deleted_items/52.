:    The last of the warm air will be scoured out of the East today with ne=
ar to below normal temperatures for most of the country by early next week.=
 A very active Southern jet stream could spin up two more significant winte=
r storms through next weekend.  From the looks of the models today, the pat=
tern is about as active as it gets. Imagine the possibilities if only there=
 was more cold air in the mix. While brutal air is still not expected, the =
potential for winter farther South is on the increase next week. We will se=
e a temporary break from the storminess over the weekend. The current storm=
 now in Pennsylvania will move out to sea and drive colder air into the reg=
ion. A cool and dry weekend seems to be shaping up for most areas, but a we=
ak low will drop out of Canada, across the Lakes and toward New England on =
Sund! ay. The current storm will probably drive out most of the available m=
oisture, but some lake effect is possible so some light snow amounts should=
 occur. The next Pacific wave comes ashore in a fairly harmless fashion ini=
tially. However, the set up looks favorable for some sort of Low pressure t=
o develop in the vicinity of the Gulf coast early next week. It would head =
toward the SE US and could be an interesting factor. As far as temperatures=
 go, the high pressure over the Western Plateau (Colorado and Utah) is keep=
ing that region in a trapped cold air mass. The Plains will slowly modify f=
rom the current shallow arctic air in place while the East undergoes a rath=
er pronounced cooling to near if not slightly below normal levels, a far cr=

still dont see us bringing in any real brutal arctic air, but the SE ridge =
that has been in place for much of January is no more. In all cases, the mo=

another potentially major winter storm, but quite a bit farther South than =
the last one. The solutions are all over the place which one would expect t=

iction of a large arctic high over the Northern U.S. It has had it for thre=

 as I would have expected. It's just another product of a strange winter I =
