I would have thought phys. would have been a priority up here.  I told Dave I wasn't involved in putting together the timetable and would forward the e-mail to you.

Chris,

Do you guys want to trade physical gas (and power?) from day 1?

If so, I note that Cdn. Operations timetable identifies this as a post day 1 item, as they think physical trades will not start until later.
