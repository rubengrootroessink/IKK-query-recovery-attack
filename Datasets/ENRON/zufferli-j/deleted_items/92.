ion:   A very healthy spring/winter storm to deal with in the short term. T=
his storm will bring about a pattern change, though still nothing severe in=
 terms of cold.  A mixed bag of precipitation has developed today over the =
Central Plains. A healthy combination of shallow cold air in the North and =
record warmth in the South will help spin up a sizeable storm in the Southe=
rn Plains later today that will turn to the NE. There are a variety of wint=
er weather watches out from Kansas, Missouri , Nebraska, Iowa, and Illinois=
. More can be expected through the Great Lakes and New England later in the=
 week. There will be snow with this, but also some potential for significan=
t freezing rain as well. The storm track is expected to run from NW Texas t=
o just South of Chicago then Western New York. To the South, this is a rain=
 ! event with some thunderstorms as well. This storm will serve to collapse=
 the strong ridge that has been in place over the Eastern U.S. I certainly =
expect a drop from the record highs of recent days, but nothing in the eart=
h shattering cold category. In fact, the raw numbers from the MRF have tren=
ded warmer the last few runs. Since we dont have a thick snow cover to tap =
from, I believe the period of cold setting up will not be as harsh as what =
we saw in late December. As all of this is going on, some of the chill that=
 has invaded the West will be lifting out. I don't see a big run to above n=
ormal with a surface high still sitting over the plateau region, but it sho=
uld not be as cold as the last couple of days.    Tomorrow: Wednesday, Janu=

hile the talk in recent outlooks for the 6-10 day period has centered on co=
ld, it is interesting to note the new 6-10 and 8-14 day outlooks from the N=
WS still have a warm bias to them. There is not a big snow cover on the gro=
und, a split flow in the jet stream is expected and the polar vortex in Can=
ada continues a slow retreat. With all of that as a backdrop, the slight po=
sitive departures look reasonable to me. We may however crank out a "Clippe=
r Type" storm next week in the Great Lakes and New England. These can somet=
imes be more prodigious snow makers than the big "Plains type" counterpart =
we are currently seeing. This is especially true if the air flows over the =
Lakes at the right angle, something I won't even try to predict this far ou=
t. Other than this system, I don't see much action in the 6-10 day period. =
Howeve! r, there is some potential for another storm to emerge out of the S=
W just after this.    Day 6: Sunday, February  3, 2002  Click Here  for Syn=
