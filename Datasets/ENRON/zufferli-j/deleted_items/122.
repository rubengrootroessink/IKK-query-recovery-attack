Guys, its getting late in the day and I feel we need to let people know where they stand. Please sit down with each of your direct reports and let them know that they will be receiving an offer of employment from UBS (hopefully by tommorrow).

With respect to Fabian and Gerry, I think its important to stress that although they didnt make the first cut, there is still a high probability of being offered UBS employment following the results of round one.
