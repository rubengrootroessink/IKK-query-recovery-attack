Hello John:

I received your voice mail since NOVA, Power Pool of Alberta, OASIS and ESBI don't fall under market data I will take them off of the list and you can setup the accounts directly with the vendors out of the Calgary office.  I will leave IHS Accumap under Market Data UBS since we currently have an agreement with them.  I will use Carmen as the contact for IHS Accumap. 

Thanks,

Danielle
