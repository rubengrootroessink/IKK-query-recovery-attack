In order to commence physical trading on February 11th, we are dependent upon the following:

	(1)	Determination of the Canadian entity name for contracting purposes
	(2)	Obtaining financial information for this entity to submit to the pipelines for their credit review
	(3)	3 - 5 business days for the pipeline to process our request

The bottom line is that unless items 1 & 2 can be resolved early next week (preferably by Monday), we will not be able to trade physical gas in Canada on day 1.  We have the pipeline requests essentially completed, but the critical pieces identified above are missing.  Also, I have been informed that under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, we are currently not allowed to contact the pipelines.  I do not have an estimate of when this restriction will be lifted, but this would also impact our ability to obtain the transportation service required to handle physical transactions.

Please let me know if you have additional questions.

We are assuming we will be physical on Monday Feb 11 in Canada.
Let me know if there is an issue.
