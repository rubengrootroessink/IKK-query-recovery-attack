This email is acknowledgement from the Power Pool of Alberta of the change
in direct sales/forward contract registration for contracts that are
currently registered with the Power Pool between Lethbridge Ironworks and
Enron Canada Power Corporation for trading after December 29 HE 1 2001.  On
January 7 the Power Pool received your acknowledgement of Enron's change in
the source asset for the direct sales/forward contract registrations for
