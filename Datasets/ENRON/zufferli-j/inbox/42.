This email is acknowledgement from the Power Pool of Alberta of the change
in direct sales/forward contract registration for contracts that are
currently registered with the Power Pool between Suncor Energy and Enron
Canada Power Corporation for trading after December 29 HE 1 2001.  On
January 4 the Power Pool received your acknowledgement of Enron's change in
the source asset for the direct sales/forward contract registrations for
contract # 1421 to modify the source from the Sundance 3 unit (SD3) to
Enron's unmetered source asset (ECP-).  The modified registration terms will
be effective December 29 HE 1 2001 and will apply until the expiry date of
