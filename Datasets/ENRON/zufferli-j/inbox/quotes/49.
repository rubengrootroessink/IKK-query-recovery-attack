Monday cal 2003 traded 36 , 36.25 , and 36.5. 2002  traded 40.
Tuesday 2002 traded 40.5 for 50 MW . One seller. It  then traded 40.
It is getting very very quiet now in any of the  other terms .... Have you talked to Sempra ? Christine Cantor in Connecticut was  looking at starting up an AB power group. I have not talked to her in a few  months but,  they have an office in Calgary.
