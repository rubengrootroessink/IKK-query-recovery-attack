Howdy ,
Friday we closed Cal 2002 $39 and Bom $25 !  
Monday , today , we had a 2003 seller who sold 75  MW, 36, 36.25 and someone else flipped it at 36.5. 
It traded away 36. 
Cal 2002 traded 40.
And, BOM went at $30 for 25 MW 
I have a feeling we need you in this market. Some  of these heat rates are pretty low. Any new things on the horizon ? If you need  more off the record colour give me a call.
