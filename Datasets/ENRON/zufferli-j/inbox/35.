Please disregard the Hydro slide (p.12 or 13) in the Presentation.  I have added a hydro tab in the quick info spreadsheet.

To continue getting familiar with Ontario, please review the document OEFC_demandSupp_UBS.ppt on your I:/common/OEFC directory.  It is a presentation we gave to OEFC in the fall.

Here is a spreadsheet with additional information.

 
Some intertie information may vary from source to source.  This is due to the IMO's regular small adjustments to the capacity numbers.
