Bryan, can you get me an answer on the discrepancies between dates identified in John's response to me below?

Further to our meeting today, please find attached the list of contracts ECC is taking the view are properly terminated and the dates of such termination (in ECC's opinion).  This list was last updated on January 9, 2002 before I went away, so Bryan, if there are any other counterparties that should be added to the list, can you please let Kyle, Eric, John and myself know as soon as possible?

Thanks
Greg
