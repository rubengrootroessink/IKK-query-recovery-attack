1) For a full requirements deal, I would like some sense of the load shape of the customer.  Having just monthly total energy consumption is not enough to price a deal.
2) The all requirements price may be less or greater than the peak price, it is dependent on load shape.
3) That is correct.

John
I would like to clarrify how the load following deals for electricity look.  I understand that you are willing to price full load following deals for ED customers for both cummulative and interval meter sites.

1.  What information do you require us to provide you to price a full requirements deal?  We generally see 12 months of average monthly consumption for cummulative meter sites.  Do you need to know which utility the customer is with?  i.e. for NSLS purposes.
2.  How would an all requirements price compare to a peak hour price?
3.  If you were to provide us with a full requirements deal I am assuming that ED would charge/pay  ECC for the delta between the fixed price and the pool price.

The ED standard contract currently does not contemplate a true all requirements deal.  The standard deal structure being used for cummulative meter sites is for a fixed price / volume block of power and for interval meter sites it is a defined volume by hour of the day  for weekdays and weekends by calendar month.

We would appreciate clarrification from you.

 Many thanks

Kate
