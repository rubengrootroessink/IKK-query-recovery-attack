Subject:	Counterparty List

Good morning everyone,
As you know we will be calling our counterparties today to discuss the Court Case slated for Wednesday. I have created a spreadsheet that lists which counterparties you have been assigned to contact. It can be found at I:/Canadian Energy Services/Counterparty Talks.xls. Please keep it updated throughout the day. It is a shared file; therefore, more than one user can access it at the same time. Just hit "F9" to update changes other users have made to the sheet throughout the day.
John - Can you please let your group know about the sheet and assign your traders to the counterparties listed under "Traders"?
Thank you,
Nicole
