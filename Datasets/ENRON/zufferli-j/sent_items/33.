garrett, you should look into buying an advanced ticket to come up to calgary for a week in a week or so, we can go through next steps, fundies, etc.

BTW, we got 3 feet of snow in the mountains this weekend, powder everywhere!!!

To continue getting familiar with Ontario, please review the document OEFC_demandSupp_UBS.ppt on your I:/common/OEFC directory.  It is a presentation we gave to OEFC in the fall.
