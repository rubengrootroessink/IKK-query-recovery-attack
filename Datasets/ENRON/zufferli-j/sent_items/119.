Hey,  no problem.  Hopefully you not allergic to hanging out with Enron guys.  The week of the 20th is fairly good.  What were you thinking?

Derek

Hi Derek,

Are you still interested in beers today?  I have unfortunately come down
with a nasty flu, I am going to have to bail out.  I feel like a scumbag
since I initiated the get together, but I'm sure you don't want to be
infected.  Would you like to reschedule for the week of November 20th?

Rob
