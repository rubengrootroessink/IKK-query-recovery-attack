I agree, I feel the same.  It feels like we are getting left behind.

John, I need you to give some thought to us intervening, from a competition law standpoint on:
1) Westcoast/Duke Merger (b.c. trading implications)
2) TCGS/Mirant Transaction (market power implications - control of ~8bcf/d supply)

It might be worthwhile for you, me, lambie, hemstock, and keohane to discuss.
