i don't know about the heart classes.  i'll look into it, but her dr (ravi)
isn't offering up any suggestions or anything.  she saw him before the
surgery in august, and he said things were okay.  i really don't think he's
too helpful.

she is lazy -- but it really frustrates me that she doesn't want to help
herself.  i told her that not walking is like not taking her heart
medication.  that didn't seem to resonate.  dad is going to go to the YMCA
tomorrow and maybe get a membership for both of them -- they have a walking
track there (at least it's something to do in the winter).  when she was
down this weekend, we walked around the craft show (at the Exhibition
place) and she said that was a lot of exercise (2 hrs).  The only problem
is that we were just strolling, and not really walking very fast.

   Hi John

   How was Thanksgiving?  Was the baby shower fun?

   I was wondering if you'd have some time to read over Ali's Chicago
   essays
   later tonight?  He's going to submit them on Wednesday.  Let me know if
   that's okay.  Do you have a printer at home?  Can I send them to your
   home
   account?  (I don't think Ali will be done before about 8pm or so
   tonight).

   PS:  We need to talk about mom.  I saw her this weekend -- she's gained
   a
   lot of weight, and hasn't been exercising at all.  Dad's pretty
   frustrated
   because all she does is watch tv.  I had a talk with her yesterday
   telling
   her that she has more risk of having a heart attack if she doesn't walk
   /
   exercise than if she exerts herself when exercising (i think she's
   afraid
   of having a heart attack while exercising).  We need to do something --
   she's 170lbs now, and should be at around 140lbs to be healthy.

   Livia
