Hey guys,

Sad day.  Monitor North America is laying off people today -- ali got fired this
 morning (he was intending to come back to work this month)
Anyway, it happened fairly quickly and without notice.  My job is safe for now,
but who knows.  I'm going to start looking
around I guess...not sure at what.  Ali's not sure what to do -- maybe apply for
 an MBA program.  John -- would you
be able to give him pointers on what he should include for a Uof Chicago
application?

I'm going to see mom tonight in London.  Her surgery is tomorrow, and she's
pretty nervous.  This is just working out to be
a fantastic week.

Liv
