Hi John,

We have determined that there was a small portion of power that was underhedged for Co-op. Lori Poffenroth has asked me to purchase this to balance our exposure.

EDC buys from ECC:

Quantity: 0.05823 MW
Flat block 7x24 financial fixed price
Start date: July 20, 2001 (or as early as possible), HE 1:00 (MPT)
End date: December 31, 2005 HE 24:00 (MPT) 

Please advise me of Price and Start Date.

Thanks. Mark.
