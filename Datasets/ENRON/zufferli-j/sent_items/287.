John,

I got into Harvard last week!  Jim had Skilling write a letter and I got in.  Kristen and I are now making the big move and will be busy moving to Boston.  I will forward my info to you guys soon.  Unfortunately, this means that we cannot make it up to see you guys this summer, but we will try sometime in the spring.  Hope all is well.

John
