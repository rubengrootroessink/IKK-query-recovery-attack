i think something's wrong with mom...she's totally down in the dumps (i've
called for the last few days now, and every time she seems depressed)

maybe you should give her a casual call, just to say hi and see what's up
(but don't make it a big deal, or else she'll pretend she's happy and
everything's okay)

PS:  i went to pottery barn kids the other day....super cute!  how's your
nursery coming along?
