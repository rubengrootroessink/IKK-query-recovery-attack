Importance:	High

Due to the continuing threat of viruses over the Internet, and the constant attacks to your broadband connections, we have made Norton Anti-Virus updates and BlackIce Security software available for use with your Clickathome computer.  You can download the software free of charge through the U.S. ClickAtHome Portal Internet site.  Below are instructions on how to get there.  PLEASE NOTE, the BlackIce software will not work on an Enron-imaged pc or your office pc.

Go to Internet Explorer (version 5.0 or greater), type in the address "clickathome.net", and enter.  Next, click on Create an id and password.  Any name and password you choose will do, as long as it is not a duplicate.  Click on "Remember User Name and Password" for convenience.  

Once you are logged on to the Portal, click on the TOOLS button at the top.  Next, click on the section entitled "Security".  You will see the links to the software.  Once you click on either BlackIce or Norton AntiVirus, you will be given detailed instructions on how to download. 

Please note that the ClickAtHome Portal is U.S. focused, and the benefits and some of the information are for US employees only. Due to the fact that Enron is developing a Global Enterprise-wise Portal, we were not allowed to move forward in completing a Canadian Portal.  Next year, the Global Portal will have information specific to Canadians.

If you have any questions or difficulties, please contact us by email at "clickathomecanada@enron.com".
