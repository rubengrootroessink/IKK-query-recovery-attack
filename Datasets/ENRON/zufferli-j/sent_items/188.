To: All Interested Parties

The ESBI Alberta Ltd.(EAL) would like to invite you to a presentation of the
results from the Powertech study to be held at EAL's offices from 2:00 pm to
4:00 pm on Tuesday October 9, 2001..  EAL commissioned Powertech Labs of
Vancouver earlier this year to carry out studies to derive Total Transfer
Capabilities (TTC) for both imports and exports across the AB-BC
interconnection.  These studies have now been completed and work is underway
to revise existing operating policies (ie.  Specifically OP-333 and OP-328).
The studies confirm that there is an increase in export capability from
additional generation in the Calgary area.

This presentation will focus on the technical results of the Powertech
studies and the impact on TTC for the AB-BC interconnection.  To make the
most of this meeting, please give some consideration to questions of
clarification around TTC you may require.  Please confirm your attendance at
this meeting with Debbie Nering at (403)-705-5210 or e-mail at
debbie.nering@eal.ab.ca <mailto:debbie.nering@eal.ab.ca>  no later than
Thursday October 4, 2001.

Yours truly,
TRANSMISSION ADMINISTRATOR OF ALBERTA
