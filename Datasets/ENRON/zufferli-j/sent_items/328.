I hope stock goes to $35 so I can buy it at reasonable levels.  Things are well here.

Hey John:

Will be in your old town next week, plan to get together with Fisher and
Cunningham and to meet Meghan Fisher for the first time.....

You have any thoughts/insight on when the bleeding stops on your stock, and
others like ILA, RRI, DYN, EPG?  Looks to me like investors are no longer
wowed by big earnings from the western markets and are very concerned about
sustainability of some very high earnings growth rate projections.  Also
curious as to how this has impacted morale vis a vis stock options and if
management is commenting.....

Hope all is well with you!
