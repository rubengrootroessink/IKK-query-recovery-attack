Take the TransCanada Hwy 1 west to Calgary.  This becomes 16 Ave N in the city.

Take Highway 2 south (Deerfoot) when you get in the city.

When you come to the Deerfoot/Glenmore intersection take Glenmore Trail East.

On Glenmore, you'll pass under Macleod Trail (there is a big mall Chinook centre on your right), you'll pass over the Glenmore reservoir.

When you get to Glenmore and 37 st get in the inside lane of Glenmore.  After 45 st, Glenmore will split in 2, stay in the inside (i.e. leftmost lanes).

This fork will lead you to a stop light where you turn left onto Highway 8 Bragg Creek.

On highway 8 you will pass 69st, after the light get in the outside lane and take your next right on Lower Springbank Rd.  At the the stop sign turn left onto Lower Springbank, you should now be going parallel to Highway 8.  After 85 st and before 101st there is a gravel entrance road on your right, take this road, it is 100 feet long and leads to Slopeview Dr, turn left when the gravel road joins the pavement and go to 133 Slopeview Dr.
