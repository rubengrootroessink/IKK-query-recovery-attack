   i think something's wrong with mom...she's totally down in the dumps
   (i've
   called for the last few days now, and every time she seems depressed)

   maybe you should give her a casual call, just to say hi and see what's
   up
   (but don't make it a big deal, or else she'll pretend she's happy and
   everything's okay)

   PS:  i went to pottery barn kids the other day....super cute!  how's
   your
   nursery coming along?
