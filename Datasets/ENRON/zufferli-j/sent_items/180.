I'll call him, I have to arrange to be there when he can come since it requires me to lift the TV with him.

He called this morning to arrange a time to deliver  that last piece.  I copied down the number but does not seem to be  correct.  I have 713-8914.  I can't find the card with his number on  the back.  Do you have it?  If so, I can call and schedule with  him.
 
love, jess
