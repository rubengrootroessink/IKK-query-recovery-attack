Hi John,
 
There's some reorganization taking place for drive access approval right now, and although I have you listed as the approver for the Traders directory, the requests for access came through to me (I'll get that fixed so that they go to you). 
 
Meantime, could you please confirm that the following individuals can have read/write access to the I:\secure\Trading directory:
 
John Disturnal
Michael Taylor
Murray Fichten
Tyler Seminuk
 
Thanks!
