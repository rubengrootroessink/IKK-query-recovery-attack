John/Cooper:

Just to keep you informed, we are progressing towards launching the AIS Demad Swap. As discussed I have a target date of Sep 30, 01 to launch this product.

Per your suggestions, we have changed the product from a peak to flat (7x24).

John, we are planning to meet and educate counterparties in Alberta to market this product. Do you think brokers are going to play a role in this? Please let me know. If yes then we will educate them on this product as well.

If you think of some thing that we need to take care of at this time, please let me know.

Thanks,

Sanjeev
