John

I am interested in joining the gas trading team next summer as I will be graduating from the U of C in April.  I don't know if I should try going through the fall recruiting or try a different route.  I have not talked to neither my superior (Peggy) nor Kathy yet.  

I've been with Enron since October, but I was (will be again this fall) doing support work for Ryan Watt, and sometimes for Mike Cowan during the weekends.  I work with their supply and demand models, calculate their positions, schedule gas on the Nova pipelines, and work with the Suncor and PetroCanada accounts together with the outsourcing team.  Over the summer, I had the opportunity to work with Kathy's group to get some experience on the slightly more complex deal types that Enron offers.

I had an interview with McKay back in early June.  However, I guess back then I was doing summer classes, the interview did not go as well as I hoped.  Now with summer classes over, I was just wondering if I could try again.

Please let me know what you think and I look forward to your reply.

Kind regards,

Victor Leung
