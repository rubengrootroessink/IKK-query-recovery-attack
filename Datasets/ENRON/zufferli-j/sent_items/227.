Hi  John,
 
Nice to meet you by email and thank-you very much  for making yourself available as a source of further info and assistance!   I'm sure you have gotten a "download" that sets the context for us to  have a conversation (or two...) over the next little while.  I am  actually flying to Calgary tonight, so I was going to try calling you tomorrow  morning - however, as a trader, would you prefer NOT to receive any calls during  business hours?  If so, when is a good time to be on the phone for  ~25min?  Please let me know.
 
Per your (relayed) request, I have also attached a  current resume.  In addition, I have pasted in some bullet points from a  recent cover letter that outline what I am interested in pursuing and what I  bring to the table.  I'm primarily interested in tapping you for some  energy industry knowledge and a sense of your experiences.  We'll see what  else can happen from there.
 
Thanks again for making yourself available and  hopefully we can hookup soon.  Have a great day!
 
Andy Crysdale.
 
 
 
What I bring to  the table:

Capabilities: I have developed a broad set of analytic,  communication and project management skills and experience. I have leveraged  these skills extensively in realising successes as a technology salesperson  and project manager, an MBA student and management  consultant.  
Capacity to Learn: Three years ago, I had never heard of  WACC.  I had written a 90th percentile GMAT and was on my was to  Ivey.  In the time since, I have completed the MBA, achieving top marks  in Finance, Marketing and an overall Dean's Honour List standing, I  have taught business courses in Russia, I have worked at two top consulting  firms, consulting on a range of projects in various industries, I have paddled  the Yukon River and my wife and I have bought a house and enjoyed the  arrival of our first child. I am a proactive learner with few  limits.  
Commitment: My personal mission statement is to  positively impact people by creating and facilitating positive change.   This core value keeps me highly motivated and interested in being a catalyst  for change.

 
What I am interested in  pursuing:
 
Strategic Planning and  Analysis:  Following on what I was doing at Monitor, I'm looking around for  companies that have an active corporate planning/internal consulting  group.  For the prospective employer, I bring a valuable set of skills  and the rigorous, hard-working disposition that is a by-product of the Monitor  pedigree.  For me, an internal planning or consulting group allows me to  keep growing my experience with various businesses or business units in  various industries.  It also allows me to network, learn an industry and,  with the right company, transition into line management in the  future.  
Business Development: I am also attracted to the  idea of growing a business, primarily because I like generating impact.   I would be interested in "business development" roles that combine an element  of selling with involvement in the strategic planning process; basically, the  processes of figuring out what to do and where, and then doing it.  
Growing, Changing Industries:  I am primarily  looking in the financial services, pharmaceuticals and energy  industries.
