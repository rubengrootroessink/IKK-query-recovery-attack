I can use your email as a request to edit the contract, if I get an email
from Enron confirming the request to edit.  Or you could enter another
contract for the 1 day.  Let me know what you would like to do.

Hi Karen - Lethbridge Ironwork's physical deal is registered incorrectly -
contract 933.  It does not include Dec 31.  How can we fix this?

Thanks,
