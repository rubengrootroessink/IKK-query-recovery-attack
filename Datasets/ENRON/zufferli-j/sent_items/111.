You don't want to fly because you're too freaked out?  That's too bad, but
understandable.  I'm not terribly excited to fly anymore either.  Does Jess
still have to go?  I guess it's okay if she's not nervous -- she'll be
fine.

   Hi John,

   How are you doing? Are you nervous to fly on Thursday?  Everything will
   be
   okay -- don't worry.  I'm going to have to start flying to Montreal
   again,
   at least one day a week, because i'm on the new case.

   How's work going?

   Livia
