Gentlemen, as you may be aware, we are looking at replacing the old desking furniture from Smed with new Smed trading desks.  The new desking system will allow us to add more people in your area.  Do you have time this afternoon to review and discuss a new floor plan using the new trading desks ?  

Regards, Nella
