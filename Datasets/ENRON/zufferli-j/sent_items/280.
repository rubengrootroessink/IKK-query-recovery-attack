Good afternoon, all.  

We are exploring ways to assist you with your financial planning needs and have asked a financial planner to meet with you 'en masse' to discuss financial structures that are out of the norm - innovative solutions to tax, retirement and other financial planning issues.  His name is Murray Greenberg and he's associated with the firm, Financial Dynamics.  Murray has extensive experience dealing with senior managers at companies that include Northstar Energy, Deloitte & Touche and Toronto Dominion. 

If, as a result of this meeting, you are interested in what Murray has to offer - you may approach him individually and arrange for personal financial planning.  You are responsible for any fees associated with future arrangements.

Please let me know if you are interested in attending this meeting or if you would like further information.  Nella and I will pull together some potential meeting dates within the next 2 weeks.

Thanks.....
