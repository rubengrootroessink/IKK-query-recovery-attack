OK, now that I've got your attention - I really am offering free lunch!  I would like to informally get together with you on Wednesday, July 18 at 11:45 am - 1:00 pm (max) to talk about your recruiting experience with Enron Canada.  We're gearing up for our 2001/02 recruiting campaign and we think your experience will help us define what works best and what can be improved in our process.

For those of you in Toronto, I apologize for not being able to schedule this over your lunch time!  However, if you can wait til 2:00pm to eat, go ahead and grab something and expense it!  We'll hook you guys in by videoconference.

I've booked Videoconference Room # 1.  Please let me know whether or not you can attend so I can order enough food.  Thanks!!
