		>                 You, or a representative from your
organization, are invited > to attend a meeting on December 11, 2001 from
2pm to 4pm in our offices. It > has been some time since the group has met
and in the mean time we, as well as the System Controller, have put > some
processes in place to address the ongoing supply adequacy concerns > within
Alberta. We would like to review how the > current processes are working and
examine areas for improvement.  We have received, from the majority, the
2002 maintenance plans. I would propose the following draft agenda and would
request additional agenda items from yourself prior to the meeting. A final
agenda would be issued before the meeting.

		1.Review of adequacy forecasts and presentation of
information.
		2.Adequacy projections for the 2001 winter peak and 2002.
		3.System restoration plans and roles.
		4.PSS/AVR reporting and the WSCC RMS program
		5.Loss factors - 2003 base cases - use of maintenance data.
