I am interested in a program for myself.  I am 33 years old, have been inactive for 6 months.  I am 6' 1'' and 225 lbs.  I can easily ride 50 km at about 27 km/h on flat terrain.  I would like to lose 15 lbs, improve my speed an definitely improve my hill climbing ability.  I live at 3800 ft altitude and hill climbing is very difficult.  I hit lactate threshold fairly quick.

Thanks
