Hey John, I sent you a letter last week in regards to TD Capital Private
Equity putting on a presentation this Thursday 10/18/2001 at 12 noon.
This is a limited partnership strategy which invests in a portfolio of
leading North American and European venture capital, leveraged buyout
and industry-specialized funds.
I think you would be interested in attending.
Please RSVP to the letter or myself.

Thanks, Mike.
