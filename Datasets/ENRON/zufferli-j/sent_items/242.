Hi,
Did you go away this weekend?  Mom kept trying to call you all weekend.

I took the cousins out all weekend -- they had a good time.  Just wondering, it
was kind of an expensive weekend (i took them out for 2 meals, plus all parking
/ other stuff).  Would you and Jess mind contributing $100-150 to the cause?  I
hate to ask, but i'm trying to keep expenses down given all recent events.

Livia
