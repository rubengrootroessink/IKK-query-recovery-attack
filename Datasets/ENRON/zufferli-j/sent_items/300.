Hi John;

I have a commitment (signed application) from the client to contract for power from Enron Direct. I now need to fix the price with you. I had given the attached spreadsheet to Jason last week and the load following ratio was calculated at 1.12 to the flat block pricing. 

The power flow date is July 20, 2001 and ends at 0:00 A.M. on August 1, 2002.

The data on the spreadsheet is the notional quantity of power in kW, for each day, by hour ending, by month. 

Total annual consumption is 3,778,235 kW.

Normally I would get Jason or Shawn to give me the price but I understand they are out of the office for the afternoon.

Please advise me if you need anything else.

Thanks,
Mark Dickin.
