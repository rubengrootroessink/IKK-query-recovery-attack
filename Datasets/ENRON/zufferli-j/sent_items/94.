Hi,

Are things a little less crazy today?  Did you and Jess work things out
last night?  Why was she so upset (besides the obvious reason on the work
front).

I just went to the cardiologist for my follow up heart tests.  They said
everything looks okay, and i just need to go back once a year for stress
tests.

I'm going to look at condos on Monday.  Starting in the Yonge and
Davisville area, then going to look at St. Lawrence Market (lofts mostly),
King & Bathurst and Bay / Bloor.  Still not sure if I should buy....

Livia
