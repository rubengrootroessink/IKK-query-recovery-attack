Okay, I feel like a bit of a spaz... I was trying to send an e-greeting out
and forgot to include the date & venue.... Those who get the email tomorrow,
here's the missing details... BTW, you will be getting another on the 6th...
sorry!!

Lauren Janzen's First Birthday Party
Saturday July 14, 2001
Start time - anytime after 2:00 pm, she will be awake by then

Please do not bring anything, especially presents, you should see how much
our house looks like a toy store already.  If you can, send me a qick reply
if you can make it.
