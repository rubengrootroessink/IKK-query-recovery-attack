This is correct, except that a significant portion of his cost should be reapplied to Enron Direct

I am just wanting to confirm information I received from Tricia Henry earlier this week -  that Sean Lalani should be getting charged to Cost Center 107083 - Power Trading.

To date he has been costed to 150156 - Power Originations.

Please advise whether it is correct to reclass all previous transactions to 107083.

Thanks
