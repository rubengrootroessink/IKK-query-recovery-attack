I can't afford to bump anyone, unfortunately all the people on this list are top notch.  We are trying to separate the cream from the cream.  Given that, and working on the assumption that Dan D is a rock star (i.e. not knowing him from Adam otherwise) I think we should relace Lalani with him.

Guys, I believe Dan would like to go to UBS. I'm not sure that I will be successful at moving our headcount up to accomodate him. Any thoughts on who we would bump? The current list is as follows (headcount = 20):

Marketing:			Trading:
Milnthorp			Zufferli
Davies				Cowan
Le Dain				Clark
Biever				Dorland, C.
Drozdiak			Draper
Sangwine			Lambie
Burnham (TO)			Richey
McPhee 			Watt
Oh (TO)				Tripp (TO)
Lalani				Brodeur (TO)*

* possibly unneccessary if D. Dorland is in. however, could support marketing
