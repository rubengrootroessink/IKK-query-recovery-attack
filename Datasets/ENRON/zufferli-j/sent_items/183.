John,
I don't disagree with any of the comments you made in my performance review, but would still like to meet with you. I'd like to discuss some stuff relating to career development, how I can improve, some learning objectives, etc. Can we set aside a half hour sometime this week or early next week? Please e-mail me the times that would work best for you.
