Everything from Ops, Trading, Marketing, and Development in Calgary, plus Mike's inputs from Toronto, has been consolidated into one master index.  The file is located at 

	I:\NewCo\00_README.xls

If you have additional items to add to your directories, or I have not yet received inputs from you, please update the master index.  There is one tab for each department.

Thanks,
