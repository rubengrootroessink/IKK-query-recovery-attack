John,

I would like to talk to you about this EES-Canada position we have.  I have attached the spreadsheet which outlines the Retail Transaction and the hedge position.   My thought is that we should be handling this position out of the Calgary office, I am working on booking of this transaction in a system where we can value it, as it stands right now we have it in an excel spreadsheet.

I will give you a call sometime later this morning.

Thanks,
Jeff Richter
