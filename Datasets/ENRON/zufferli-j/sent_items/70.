Dad asked if I wanted to lend you some money but I am reluctant to do it at
this point in time since:

a) I am not completely at liberty to touch all the cash that I have
received lately for concern that it may be taken bank under potential
creditor action against Enron.  Unfortunatelty, without this cash, I really
can't afford to lend any.  The cash that I received recently represents 80%
of the cash that I have and I am not sure when I can count on this cash
with any degree of certainty.  Therefore, I am reluctant to touch this
money for at least 6 months.

b) As of right now, I don't have a job after Feb. 28.  The new company deal
that Enron is trying to structure with its traders and a new buyer will not
be
done until the month.  If this deal falls through, then I have to find a
job with another company.  In this case, it is most likely that I will have
to move back to the
US since my contacts and the most lucrative opportunities (i.e. compared
the the new Enron deal) are there.

c) If I had the cash to give, Dad asked that I could give you a discount to
the bank mortgage.  With discount rates near 5%, even if I gave you a
mortgage at
4%, I don't think the monthly interest saving for you would be material
enough.

d) I think it is good for you to develop a credit rating with a bank
through a mortgage.  It is very beneficial for later on in life.  Paying
visa bills does help you a bit in this
category, but not like a mortgage.


Hopefully, you can get the financing from a bank.  I think that this is the
best solution in the long run.

   Hi John,

   Wanted to talk to you about the house stuff.  Dad told me that he was
   talking to you about financing options.  I just wanted to say that I
   don't
   want you to feel compelled to write a mortgage for me -- dad's just
   trying
   to explore different options.  I know it's a lot of cash, and I would
   never
   want to impose on you.  I'm sure that I can get a mortgage from the bank
   at
   a decent rate, as long as I can put down the 25% down payment so that I
   can
   avoid the mortgage insurance, which is costly.  I'm cashing in some GICs
   and other bonds, and Ali's going to lend me $10K, so I will be able to
   come
   up with the $55K for the down payment.

   If writing the mortgage is something that you would like to do for a
   stable
   investment, then we can talk too.  My time horizon on the condo is 5-7
   years, so i recognize that that would hold up your capital for a long
   while.  Anyway, I have to go ahead and get the guarantee of financing
   within 5 days or so, so I have to make a decision in the next day either
   way.  Maybe you can call, or email me?

   Livia
