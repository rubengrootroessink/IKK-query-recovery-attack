I think you need to do this.  They want the info today for PRC reasons.

Hi John,
As I mentioned in my voice mail, Louise has asked that we confirm the information on the attachment, and if appropriate, allocate funds to everyone involved with these deals. We initially assigned the funds to your name because there were not any names listed in the Risk Books for these deals. (please refer to Canada-Zufferli on the Originator tab.)

If you could, please let me know your thoughts by the end of day today per her request.  I'm at x30352 if you have any questions. Thanks!

Hi Louise,

As requested, attached is a file that contains June YTD Originations by Originator.

We've arranged the file in the following sorts:

by team
by Originator (sorted alphabetically)
by Originator (sorted by value)
Top 10 Overall Originators by Value
Top 10 Originators- Gas
Top 10 Originators- Power

An item to note is that not all deals had a related individual's name (such as Enduser)- we left the listing as it appears in the Risk Book in these cases.

We'll send you an update if the DPR amounts move (the DPR isn't final yet.)

Please let me know if you need any additional information!
