What did you have in mind, John?  (3 hours??)  I was thinking that he should go through the same interviews as the other candidates.  Any thoughts?

Dawn,

In addition to my prior e-mail, I have already had an interview with John Zufferli, John Disturnal, Mike Cowan, and Chris Lambie on September 13, 2001.  The interview lasted for 3 hours!  I have not heard back from any of them yet.  Just wondering, would that then be considered as my first round of interview, or would that be already my "Super Thursday (Saturday)"?

I would also like to thank you for putting me as one of the potential candidates.  I have attached a copy of my updated resume and a copy of my online academic record.  My GPA is back to where I used to be, around the 3.3 range.  Let me know if you would like me to fax in a transcript to you as well.

If you would like more information, please don't hesitate call me at 605.7568 (cell) or e-mail me at school vbleung@ucalgary.ca.

Have a wonderful week ahead!

Victor Leung
