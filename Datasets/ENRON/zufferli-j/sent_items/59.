Things are going well here. We have been working on cleaning up Dec. I cautiously optimistic about UBS. I think the fact that they put no money up front could make things difficult with the creditors. I am not sure if they will accept the fact that will only get money from profits that we make. There are no guarantees that we will be profitable.

Yeah, the last few weeks are hard. I am sure she is at the point she just wants it over with. Are you ready for your life to get flipped around. It's a lot of fun but difficult for the first 2 months. After that it get's easier as you go.

So I assume you are riding it out with UBS? Not sure how I feel about the situation. Could be just the fear of the unknown.

How is Cooper doing?

John

John, thought I would drop a line and see how things are going. Not much to report here, just waiting to see what the fall out from the sale will be. How is Jessica and baby to be doing?
