Chili and Cheddar Bow Tie Casserole
 
1 (7oz) can chipotle chiles in adobo  sauce
1 tablespoon butter
1 cup chopped red bell pepper
1/2 cup diced Canadian bacon (about 2  oz)
1 cup thinly sliced green onions
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
2 1/4 cups 2% reduced-fat milk
2 cups (8 oz) shredded reduced-fat sharp cheddar  cheese
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
8 cups hot cooked farfalle (bow tie pasta) or other  short pasta
Cooking spray
 
Preheat oven to 400 degrees
 
Remove 1 teaspoon adobo sauce and 1 chile from  canned chiles; mince the chile.  Place remaining sauce and chiles in a  zip-top plastic bag and freeze for future use.
 
Melt butter in a large Dutch oven over medium-high  heat.  Add bell pepper and bacon; saut? 4 minutes.  Add onions; saut?  1 minute.  Stir in the adobo sauce, minced chile, flour, chili powder, salt  and cumin; cook 1 minute.  Gradually add milk; cook until thick and bubbly  (about 4 minutes), stirring constantly with a whisk.  Remove from  heat.  Gradually add 1 1/2 cups cheese and cilantro, stirring until cheese  melts.  Add pasta to pan; toss well.
 
Spoon the pasta mixture into a 11x7-inch baking  dish coated with cooking spray.  Sprinkle 1/2 cup cheese over pasta  mixture.  Bake at 400 degrees for 15 mins or until browned.   Yield:  6 servings
 
 
Cooks note:  I could not find the prepared can  of whole chiles with the sauce so I just used the can of diced green chiles I  found in the Mexican food isle and threw in what looked to be the right  amount.
 
Enjoy!
