1 user of accumap

 I'll look into the other issues, I just thought that you may know who may be handling it, we may just do it directly from Calgary

John:

I have not found anyone who was trying to renew these contracts.  I am meeting with IHS on Thursday so I will make sure we add Accumap.  How many user of Accumap will you need?  I will forward the cost to you prior to sending the contracts to UBS.  

Do you know who managed the contracts with NOVA, Power Pool of Alberta, OASIS or ESBI so that I can gather contact information and begin the contract management of these applications.

Thanks,

Danielle

John:

Here are the contracts we are currently creating with UBS.  Please verify that we have not missed any applications/publications or subscriptions.  

Highlight in Red the systems you will need and mark the priority from 1-5,  1 being critical.


Thank you,

Danielle
