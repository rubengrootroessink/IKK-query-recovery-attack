Hi John 
 
The Critical Illness packages were delivered Oct.12 and should be an entire policy in a clear plastic zip bag.  If you can not find the policy at home or around your desk I will gladly request a new policy from Unum.  Unfortunately this is not a generic form, but one that had been preprinted by the Insurance Company.   Let me know...
 
Thanks,
Michelle
