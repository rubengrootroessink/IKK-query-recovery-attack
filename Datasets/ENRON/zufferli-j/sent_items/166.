An update from the ADaMS implementation team...

Last week was quite hectic with training and last minute fixes. My thanks to
all of you for your patience and participation and apologies for some
appointments missed.

1. This afternoon we implemented the System Controller portion of the AdAMS
software. All real dispatches will continue 'voice only' until this Thursday
at 14:00.

2. Our development/ test  system will be available until Thursday afternoon
for training dispatches. Al Gulutzan (403-233-4685) is in charge of
participant training.

3. On Thursday at 14:00, we will enable the Participant portion of the ADaMS
software. We expect that you have your people logged in and we'll begin the
parallel operation period where all dispatches will be sent electronically
and will be accompanied by voice dispatch. This period is expected to last 2
weeks. We fully expect that some participants will need longer than 2 weeks
and some will need less.

4. Please advise by return-email if you do not wish to be on this
distribution list or if you want someone else to be on the list
