hey there.  dad told me that you got your bonus -- congratulations!  that's
a piece of good news at least.

i got some bad news about bonuses today -- we usually get them paid out
this week, but we just got an email from our CEO saying that only a few
"exceptional performers" will get some sort of bonus but they won't
disclose the information until the end of January.  given that i have to
have a new place to live for february, i don't think that I'll be able buy
a condo anymore (the bonus money would have been for the down payment).
anyway, kind of annoying but i guess i should be grateful that i have a
job.

mom's size is large -- she's 5'4" and about 145 pounds.  could you pass
this on to jess?

by the way, our flight comes in at around 10pm on saturday, but i'll call
to confirm
