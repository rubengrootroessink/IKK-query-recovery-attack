Once again , the EOL report is ignoring the new customer list that I have given twice now.  They seem to insist that the the Canadian subs that are now tradinig Alberta power that have traded other products on EOL are not new customers. I have all but given up on this issue.

In terms on of # of trades/day for Alberta Power, the numbers for Aug and Sep are low:

August is 24 trades/day not 22 trades/day
Sep is 13 trades/day not 8 trades/day

I will check the gas info later

Gentlemen, you have recently received hard copies of the 3rd quarter soft targets.  Attached for your reference are the electronic versions of the soft targets.

Paul, your hard copies will arrive on Monday.
