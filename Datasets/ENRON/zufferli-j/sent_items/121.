Hi John, this survey looks pretty innocent.  It seems to focus on customer satisfaction.  Do you want to have any input to the responses.  If not, I will respond and submit it.

Mark

Dear Mark  :

Here is the Customer Satisfaction Survey promised in my October 31, 2001 letter. Your input will help improve Customer Service at ESBI Alberta Ltd.  Our consultant, Praxis Research, has worked with us to develop an easy-to-use online survey that should only take about 5-10 minutes to complete.

You may complete the survey online or fax a completed printed version of the web survey to 1-403-249-8983.  If you would prefer to complete the survey via telephone, please call Praxis Research at 1-888-882-1285.

To access the online survey, please click on the following Internet link: www.praxis.ca/eal/eal_survey1.htm.

We have assigned you an individual password: mad98  which you need to access the survey.   If you do not complete the survey at one sitting you can use your password to re-enter the survey and finish your partially completed survey or revise your responses. (Up to Nov. 30 at which time the response period terminates and we analyze the input).

Your responses are confidential. Praxis, the independent research firm collecting the information, will aggregate all data. Comments will always be aggregated by Praxis to maintain individual confidentiality. If, however, you choose to identify yourself, EAL will be glad to respond to any specific comments you make. If you have any questions or concerns about the online survey please contact David de Lange at Praxis Research at 1-888-882-1285 or by email at delange@praxis.ca.

All participants will receive an executive summary of the survey.  In addition, early in 2002 we intend to host a workshop to, among other things, develop customer service improvement initiatives in response to the survey findings.

Your participation in this survey is greatly appreciated.


Sincerely,


Vincent Flynn
President and CEO
ESBI Alberta Ltd.
