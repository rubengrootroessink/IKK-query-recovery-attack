Karim , this is the deal that I was talking about this morning.  Albert is saying that it should have appeared in Friday's P&L.  Can you check this with him and let my know today.  When you said it was in tonights P&L, I think Albert was talking about the Telus deal not the Cisson deal.

Here is the latest Enron Direct deal that was previously entered.  The total volumes is about 5700 Mwh, and the P&L impact is about positive 53K.  If you have any questions, please let me know.  

Albert.
