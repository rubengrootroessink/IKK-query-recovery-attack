It would probably make sense to have all operational correspondence sent to me.

Thanks

This is operational stuff I received from the Power Pool.  

I seem to be receiving a lot of this kind of stuff and I think it is now appropriate for Enron to change our designated contact person with the Power Pool from me to someone who is more operationally focused.  Please let me know who you want to do that and I will advise the Power Pool of the change.
