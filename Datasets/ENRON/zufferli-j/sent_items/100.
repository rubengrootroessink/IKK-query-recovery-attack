Hi John

How was Thanksgiving?  Was the baby shower fun?

I was wondering if you'd have some time to read over Ali's Chicago essays
later tonight?  He's going to submit them on Wednesday.  Let me know if
that's okay.  Do you have a printer at home?  Can I send them to your home
account?  (I don't think Ali will be done before about 8pm or so tonight).

PS:  We need to talk about mom.  I saw her this weekend -- she's gained a
lot of weight, and hasn't been exercising at all.  Dad's pretty frustrated
because all she does is watch tv.  I had a talk with her yesterday telling
her that she has more risk of having a heart attack if she doesn't walk /
exercise than if she exerts herself when exercising (i think she's afraid
of having a heart attack while exercising).  We need to do something --
she's 170lbs now, and should be at around 140lbs to be healthy.
