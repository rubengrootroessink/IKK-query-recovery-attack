Not sure if you have seen this or not, but I thought it was cute.....

 On July 26, 2000, two friends, Jim and John, each received a $1000 bonus
 at work.
 (They both work for Nortel Networks, where in the summer of 2000, there
 was LOTS of money around for bonuses). Jim, being an intelligent,
 financially conscientious person, put the whole $1000 into Nortel
Networks stock. With his $1000, and the transaction cost of
 $35, he was able to purchase 7 shares at $123 each. Having watched the
 Nortel stock climb and climb, he felt very good about this investment,
 happy that he is preparing for the future.

 John, being a more care-free sort, did something slightly different with
 his $1000. John borrowed a friend's truck, and proceeded to the
  Beer Store, where he purchased 33 cases of beer. John also felt very
good about his investment: 33 cases x 24 = is 792 bottles of beer! John,
also
 being an intelligent guy, although perhaps not as forward-thinking as
Jim, calculated that he could drink about 15 bottles per week, and he
wouldn't
 have to buy beer for a whole year.

 Jim, of course, was appalled by John's purchase, and berated him
 constantly about it. As months went by, Jim excitedly watched the
 stock prices, and saw it start to dwindle. "It'll go back up", he'd say
to Jim.  Jim, who has been reaping the benefits of his investment
on a daily basis, would reply, "Ya, it will.  Hang in there buddy "burp".

 Months went by, and the value of the stock continued to fall, and there
 was the beginnings of a noticeable dent in the beer pile. Midwinter came,
 Jim's stock had fallen to about half of it's original value, and John's
 beer was about half gone. Jim, being sure that the
 stock had hit rock-bottom, still was berating John for his frivolous
 purchase, telling him "Your beer will be gone in six months! Who knows
 what my stock will be worth!!".

 Well, summer has come, and hard times at Nortel continue. Bad news: Both
 John and Jim have been affected by the layoffs.  Last week, in order to
 raise some cash to help through the rough time, Jim sold his 7 shares, at
 that day's value of $12, and got $84, then after paying the $35
 transaction fee, he only had $49.

 Jim stopped by John's house later that day (everyone needs their friend's
 during rough times), and as luck would have it, there were
 two bottles of John's beer left. John, being a good, compassionate
friend, offered to share his last two bottles of beer with his friend.
 Jim appreciated the gesture, and enjoyed the cold beer on the hot
summer's day, but he felt a bit guilty.

 "At least I got fifty bucks back out of it - you have nothing now.", he
 said. "That's ok.", replied John.  "Perhaps you can help me, I need to
 return all these empties.", he added as his other friend with the truck
 pulled in. So, they loaded up the truck, and proceeded off to the beer
 store.

 Upon arrival at the beer store, they unloaded the empties, feeling a
 little grim. John went to the counter, and collected his refund for the
 bottles. "33 cases x 24 bottles, at 10 cents per bottle, that comes to
 $79.20", the friendly Beer Store clerk said to John as he handed him the
 money. Jim was speechless. Poor guy. Can you imagine  how you would feel
 if you just discovered that over the course of the
 last year, your $1000 stock investment left you with $50, and taking same
 $1000, buying beer, and drinking it, would leave you with $80. I'll leave
 it up to the reader to come up with they're own "moral to the story".
