The balancing pool committed in the their beginning of year release to dispatch Milner as follows:

70 MW @ $0
50 MW @ $35.49

Milner has been down for maintenance until recently.

Since coming back from maintenace, the 50 MW block @ $35.49 has disappeared.  We analyzed the offer stack and it appears
that Milner has the full 120 MW @ $0

I called Doug Heath to discuss this.  He hasn't called me back. 

The issue I raised last week about Sherness dispatch is OK. I received a justified answer.  However, this Milner issue is harder for th pool to defend.

Can we pursue this.


Thanks

John
