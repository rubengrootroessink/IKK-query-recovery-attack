Hi John,

Remember i told you about the guy at work who got fired last week -- he has
a brand new baby and just bought a new house?  Anyway, he wanted to speak
to people in the oil and gas industry (his wife is originally from Calgary
and they may be interested in moving back).  I think he just wants general
info about the type of work you do (or others in the field) and what he
should think about in terms of applying to firms.  Is it okay if i give him
your number?  If so, would you prefer work or home?

livia
