Gentlemen, on July 25th I had forwarded to you a memo and the results of the second quarter soft targets for Enron Americas.  I have not heard back from you with respect to the accuracy of the information in the reports.  Could you kindly let me know if changes should be made to these reports in order that I may forward our corrected information to Houston.

Regards, Nella
