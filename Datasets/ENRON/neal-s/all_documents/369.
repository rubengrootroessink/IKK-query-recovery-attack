FYI - This is a memo that Jim Scabareti sent to Clayton Preble and others on 
the AGL team regarding the deal and potential regulatory issues.  I thought 
you might like to see it.  I will be talking to Jim and Clayton later today, 
and will give you an update thereafter.  If you have any questions, please 
ask.
Ed
