Scott, I would like to sue Kim in an expanded role within the group. She will 
still be responsible for all of her current activities but will also work 
with the group on Pipeline postings and expansions, RFP and information 
responses, Development of Presentations, etc.  I think that in the long run 
she can develop and be moved into other positions.  Especially after she 
earns her degree.  I have spoken with HR.  We will monitor to assure that she 
does not let any of her curent responsibilities slide.  Let me know if you 
have and concerns.


Also, I have completed the Performance plan for John Hodge ( Required due to 
his ranking in 2000).  I will leave a copy on your desk for review and 
execution.  Let me know if you have any questions.



Frank
