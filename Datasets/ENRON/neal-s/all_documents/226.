Subject: Computer problems

I keep getting "insufficient memory" messages on my computer.  And that's 
without running Dynegy Direct.

The IT guy said I need one of the following
1.  New super duper computer
2.  More memory, my computer has 128meg of ram
3.  Run my applications on 2 cmputers like mine instead of one.
