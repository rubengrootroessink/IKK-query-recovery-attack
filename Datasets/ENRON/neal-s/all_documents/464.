Hey bud the girls from Filo are requiring your presence. The blonde is not 
there any longer so it's not worth going anymore.

As promised I'm attaching my resume. I'm currently leading our EES Industrial 
strategy in Argentina so I haven't being selling any nat gas or power to 
customers lately (if we ever could........). It's challenging but there are 
other reasons that are making me explore new alternatives.

Let's talk once you have time to do so.

Take care and I appreciate your help.
