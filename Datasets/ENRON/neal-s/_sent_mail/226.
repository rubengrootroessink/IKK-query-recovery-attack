Linda, our first wellhead book day trade; gas daily for the weekend was 
$8.175.  I'd also ultimately like to fix the price for the remainder of the 
month, but I don't want to take a "long term position" without more input 
from management.

Vicki, this will confirm that we converted 3,000 of our 4,000 swing traunch 
on Transco (deal 505902) to a fixed price of $10.16 for tomorrow only, 
12/12/2000.  Please work with Will Kelly to change the ticket appropriately.

Will, consistent with the tickets we provided you earlier today, you entered 
the following deals with the volumes indicated in the column "11/28/00 
Tickets":


Tennessee    11/28/00    10/26/00
     Tickets    Quote

Baseload
Cabot:  #505762    11,280     9,136
D2D:  #505910

Swing:
Cabot:  #505855    2,820     2,284
D2D:  #505913

Transco

Baseload
Cabot:  #505870    14,720     14,400
D2D:  #505892

Swing
Cabot:  #505880    3,680     3,600
D2D:  #505902


But, the volumes cited in the tickets prepared today were not consistent with 
the volumes for which the East Desk originally provided price quotes based on 
the volumes we cited on 10/26/00.  I have spoken with Scott Neal and he is 
agreeable to allowing us to amend the Sitara deals to reflect the 10/26/00 
volumes rather than the 11/28/00 volumes.  Please, therefore, substitute the 
Quoted volumes for the Ticketed volumes on the 8 deals listed above.  Thanks 
much.

I have prepared and attach herewith revised tickets.
