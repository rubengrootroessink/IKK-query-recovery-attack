The state of NJ has an RFP out for 7 months supply beginning Dec 1,2000. The 
volumes are as follows
All deliveries to City Gate: 
( Total Volume for 7 months -Therms)
FT
NJ Nat Gas: 1,070,845
Elizabethtown; 179,955
PSE&G: 7,592,092
South Jersey:325,842
 
IT(LDC)
PSEG; 251,814
South Jersey;728,801

The mandatory bid meeting was this morning. I asked the guys in the NJ EES 
office to attend. We are meeting tomorrow to discuss this and the rest of the 
state's needs (Up to 5 contracts /day). This RFP is very small, but there are 
bigger rfp's to come. Furthermore, NJ transit is also bidding ga and  is 
considering long-term supplies (5 - 10 yrs) as an alternative to the current 
high one year prices. I will keep everyone informed as this progresses.

Thanks
Jennifer
