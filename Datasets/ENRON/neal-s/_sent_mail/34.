I have attached a list of Enron's Top Trading customers who are not doing business on EOL.  Customers designated as Execute are signed up on EOL and can begin transacting if they have suitable credit.  Please circulate this list to your team to push some of these counterparties to begin using EnronOnline.  If you have any questions, feel free to contact either myself or Bryan Hull.  Thanks for your help.
