We are heading home.  Me in November and Beth after school is out Dec 15th. 
We will buy Beth's parent's house in Memorial.  

I took a job at EES working for Marty Sunde running the risk management for 
them.  They have a huge position and it is keeping Rick Buy awake at night.  
I will talk to you soon.
