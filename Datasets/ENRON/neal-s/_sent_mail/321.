Jana,

Would it be possible to provide me with a list of all analysts working within 
ENA (along with their current assignments)?

Thank you.

Let me know what you think after you have contacted them so we can move 
forward with placement in your group.  Thanks.

Ted,

Jeanie and I met with Scott Neal (VP Gas Trading East Desk)  yesterday and he 
mentioned that he needs an Analyst as soon as is possible.  Should I contact 
Jana Giovannini or do you send her our request?  

Thanks,
Jennifer
