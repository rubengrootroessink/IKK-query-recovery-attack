Subject: Sabotage Acts

Argentine Power Market update:
A series of sabotage acts occurred last Tuesday, putting the whole Argentine 
Electric System in danger of collapsing. The problems started at 8:30 PM when 
one of the 500 kV lines from the Comahue region went down. Around 10:30 PM, 2 
other lines went down as well, all in the Comahue-BsAs corridor. All 3 
incidents were due to sabotage acts, in which the tensiles holding the high 
tension towers were sawed.
In addition to the transmission lines sabotage, at 10:00 PM, one of the 
Nuclear plants suffered technical problems and kicked out 640 MW.
This situation created a huge swing in the frequency of the system and an 
overload of the 4th line from Comahue, which finally went out of service as 
well at 1:30 am, and was out of service for 1 hour. This last event kicked 
out the exports to Brazil which were at 1040 MW.

As a result of all the above power prices reached $170 per MWh during 11:00 
PM.
Transmission lines are expected to be re-established by Saturday.

For who might be interested, below is a detailed document and map showing the 
sequence of incidents and the damages caused (in Spanish).
