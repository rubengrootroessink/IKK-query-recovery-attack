I sent them last week to your parent's address.  You should receive them by 
the end of  this week.  
Have a good week.

Scott:

I hope all is well in Houston.  I just wanted to send you a reminder about
those three books that you were going to send me.  If you haven't already
done so, here's my address at LSU, rather than sending them to my parents'
house:

2510 Gates Circle #27
Baton Rouge, LA 70809

Thanks and see ya' soon,

Kevin Murray
