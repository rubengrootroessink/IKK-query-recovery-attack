Sure, no problem.   Sep 25-27 will be the heart of October bid week.

I am a legal assistant for Jeff Hodge.  At his suggestion,  I am contacting 
you concerning the possibility of spending time with you or a trader in your 
area observing "the business"  during bid week if possible, in order that I 
may gain experience and information concerning gas trading.  A few hours in 
the morning or whenever is best for you.  

Thanks for your help!
