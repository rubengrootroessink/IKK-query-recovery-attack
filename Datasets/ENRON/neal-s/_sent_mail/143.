Subject: Performance Reviews

Please submit all signed performance reviews to me by Friday, March 16th.  If 
you are unclear as to which reviews are still outstanding, please send me an 
email so that I may provide you with a list.  I appreciate your cooperation 
in closing out the year end process.  Thanks.
