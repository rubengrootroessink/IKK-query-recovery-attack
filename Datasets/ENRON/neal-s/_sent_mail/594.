Scott

I believe that you are representing the Associate, Ted Noble for the PRC 
meeting on July 19.  Jay Fitzgerald is the manager for Ted and is requesting 
that I set up a 15 - 20 meeting with you this Thursday for the both of you to 
discuss his ranking and accomplishments.

Could you please follow-up with me for this meeting.

Thanks

Kim
