I hear you have excellent bone fishing.  We'd like to use light tackle for

  Dear Mr. Todd Neal,

  There are several fishing guides on the island.  We will
need to know what
  type of fishing you are interested in doing then we can
provide you with a
  contact.

  Definitely no golf course on the island.

  We are looking forward to have you as our guest.

  Sincerely,

  Kim Reyes
