Kathy Kelly EXCELLENT    The performance of the group in the area of 
operations/logistics is superior.  Kathy is able to manage multiple tasks and 
is able to get performance form her people.  Even with the dramatic growth 
of  our business, the ops group has been able to manage to sustain a very 
high level of performance.  I think Kathy could improve in the commercial 
area (idetifying important data/market info) and thinking of ways to improve 
our business model though systems, organizational structure, etc..

Ed Terry  SASTIFACTORY/STRONG   Similar comments as above in the area of 
operations/logistics.  Ed's scope is fairly narrow, very centered to 
operations/logistics.   I would like Ed to improve his ability/wllingness to 
make decisions.   Very little commercial understanding, although shows 
interest in learning.
