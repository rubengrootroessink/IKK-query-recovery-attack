Scott-
 Hey there, this is Chris Graeter.  I wanted to check with you to see about
getting in touch with the person in charge of internships.  I am sure he or
she is busy, but in the mean time I was not sure if you or the person who
would be contacting me had my email address.  It is cgraeter@tamu.edu.  I
know that sometimes it is easier to get in touch with someone by email so I
wanted to make sure you had this information.  Thank you again for all your
assistance.  I hope to talk to you soon.

Sincerely,
Chris Graeter
