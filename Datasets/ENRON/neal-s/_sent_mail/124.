Thanks Scottie for your feedback I was about to gove you a call but you made 
it easier for me, I hate bugging people.
I also think Chris was very positive about me joining his team.

Thanks again and I truly hope I can make up there. Florencia is also excited 
about us living a family experience in the US.

Thanks buddy.
