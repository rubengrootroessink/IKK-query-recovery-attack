Subject: Bad Trader

Please add Dan Junek to your list of 'Bad Traders" he entered into two 
transactions with National Energy and Trade, LLC, without notifying Credit of 
the transactions.  Both transactions were October one month Physical Sales of 
Natural Gas for a total of 232,500 mmbtu's at index plus .0050.   Total 
Delivery exposure is roughly $1.2MM.  A Letter of Credit has been required 
for this trade.

Veronica Espinoza had a conversation with Dan within the past month, 
explicitly stating our credit concern for this counterparty and told Dan not 
to trade with the counterparty unless it was approved by Credit.  The 
counterparty was added to the Credit Watch List after this conversation last 
month.

Regards,
Russell
