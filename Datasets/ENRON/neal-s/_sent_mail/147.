All is well here.   It sounds like you are very busy.  I glad you are taking 
the options course - it will really benefit you.  Also,  Andrea Richards is 
the person I 
contacted with the Associate program to request that your first rotation be 
in the Trading group - so we should be in good shape on that front.  Her 
phone number is 713 853 6499 for your future reference.  Thanks for the 
email, I look forward to seeing you this summer.

Scott

Scott:

Greetings from LSU.  I sent you an email a few weeks ago, but perhaps you
didn't receive it.  No big deal.

I just wanted to drop you a line and let you know how I'm doing.  My last
semester is shaping up to be pretty tough.  The MBA class in Real Options
is, to say the least, tough!  I'm preparing for my mid-term right now, and
so far we've learned about Binomial trees, Sharpe ratios, the GOPOP model,
risk-neutral pricing, Stochastic Processes, Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo,
and pricing American, European, and exotic options.  What's also great
about the class is that our professor constantly uses Enron as an example
of how this stuff works in the real world.  It's a great class!

One of my other classes, Economic Forecasting, is challenging as well,
because I'm dealing with a software package, Eviews, for the first time.
Enough about the academics, though; I'm working hard and that's what I need
to be doing.

I've also started reading Reminiscences, and I find myself highlighting
lines on every page!  I figured I'd start with the less technical books
first, considering my workload.

I'm going to be in Houston looking for apartments this weekend, 3/9 - 3/11
with my roommate, Ed Brady, who will also be at Enron in July.  Let me know
how your schedule looks, and maybe we can get together.

Hopefully my getting into your fundamentals group or the new trading
rotation that you spoke of is still a high probability.  As I'm learning
more about options and futures in class, you're definitely right--I think
trading is where I want to be!

Thanks again and I hope to hear from you soon.  I hope all is well in
Houston.

Kevin
