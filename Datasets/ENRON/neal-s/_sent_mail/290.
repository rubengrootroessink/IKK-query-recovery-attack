Hey guys, I spoke with Carol and told her we would have an overview for ENA 
by next Friday. Could each of you e-mail me a brief summary of your business 
in Florida- just give me a general idea of our level of involvement in your 
market, general themes we might want to get across, hurdles, etc. Ben/Jim, 
this may be a very good opportunity to have Kevin lay out our views/plans for 
deregulation and power development, and what we would like to see the 
Governor push in the state. Since Enron is in Texas (and the obvious 
connection with the Bush brothers), if it's appropriate to use Texas 
deregulation as an example/comparable with Florida, it might be interesting. 
If I could get your responses by next Wednesday am, they would be great. 
Thanks.

Janet and Jim,

Kevin Hannon is attending a dinner and a breakfast meeting (November 8th and 
9th) with Governor Jeb Bush in Florida.  At this meeting the Governor has 
requested that the attendees give a three to five minute overview of their 
company and its interests in Florida.  Kevin asked me to contact you two to 
see if you if could please give him a brief update via email on ENA's 
activities in Florida.

Thank you,
