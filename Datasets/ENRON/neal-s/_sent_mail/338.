Hi  Scott,
?
Per your suggestion in  our last telephone conversation, I am attaching the 
resume of an individual  
who has significant  experience in marketing and trading nat gas in the 
Northeast.? Would you  please consider
his qualifications and  background and let me know what you think?? Thanks a  
lot.
