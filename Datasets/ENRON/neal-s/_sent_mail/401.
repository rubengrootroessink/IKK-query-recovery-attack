The first invoice for $5.4 million went out a couple of weeks ago.  CES came 
back to us and said they were not going to pay.  They claimed that the total 
of all of the invoices to this date that they have already paid had covered 
that amount.  I have researched all of their invoices, and it looks like 
there was a demand invoice in the system for the month of June for 
approximately $6 million to much.  CES incorporated a credit for that invoice 
in with the charge for $5.4 million, netting out to approximately $600,000.  
I am meeting with CES on Thursday to see if we are in agreement.  The other 
invoice for $7.5 million was sent out last week, CES is in agreement and the 
payment should be here shortly.
   If you have any questions don't hesitate to call me.

FYI - ongoing CES reconciliation. At this point we will be receiving app. 
$5.4M (invoice sent on 7/27) with another $7.5M to be billed to them next 
week.

Still more to come, for details read the attached from Molly.
