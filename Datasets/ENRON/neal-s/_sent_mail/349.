The results of the February 26th PVT test conducted on Nville have been 
discussed with each of you over the last three months.  As we have 
discussed....effective Sep 13th,  Anita will make the adjustments to Enron's 
inventory and pad gas to reflect the February 26th results.

I talked with Gary Wilson, and he confirmed that the revised values are 
correct.  Attached is a spreadsheet that contains the values.

The correction to the working gas includes TWO corrections.  The results of 
the February 26th test reduces the working gas by 398,487MMBTU.  In addition, 
there is a reduction of 22,101MMBTU which is the difference between the SCADA 
values (Best Available) that Anita showed on the February 29th Storage Sheet 
and the "official" February 29th values that Gary Wilson received from MIPS.

To summarize:
 Enron's pad gas will now be 3,993,310MMBTU, instead of 4,223,000MMBTU.
 Enron's working gas will be reduced by 420,588MMBTU.


Call me if there are any questions.
