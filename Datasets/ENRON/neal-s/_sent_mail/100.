Subject: Professional Administrative Assistants Week

Next week is professional administrative assistants week.  If you are in 
agreement, I will order your assistant a beautiful bouquet to be delivered on 
Monday for her to enjoy all week.  The floral companies are already receiving 
orders and I want to order the flowers by Friday. 

If there is anything else that you want done, please let me know and I will 
be happy to help you out since your schedules are so busy.
