Subject: MEETINGS REGARDING MARKET DATA APPLICATION

IF YOU HAVE NOT ALREADY RESPONDED TO THE MAIL REGARDING THE MEETINGS THAT 
WILL BE HELD ON TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY OF NEXT WEEK WITH BRIDGE, 
REUTERS AND GLOBALVIEW PLEASE DO SO AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

You should have received a message inviting each of you to a one hour meeting 
on each day.  If you have any questions or 
concerns regarding this issue please contact me as soon as possible at 
x-39225.

It is important that I hear from each of you regarding your attendance at 
these events.  We realize that this is a large time committment on your 
part,  but your input is essential in the decision making process of choosing 
a new front end application for your Market Data needs.



I appreciate your assistance!
