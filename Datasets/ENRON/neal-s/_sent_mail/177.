today i did an intraday deal between hydroquebec and connecticut natural

i bought 4000 of dracut from Hyrdoquebec @ $5.65  sitara deal number 618541
i sold it to connecticut natural at their gate @ $6.03 via unutilized 
intraday capacity  sitara deal 618626

the capacity costs are $0.09.  orgination should be granted on 
$6.03-.09=$5.94 equivalent at dracut.

or $5.94-5.65=.29 on 4000 mmbtu = $1,160

also i haven't seen the orgination on the feb8 transaction per my previous 
email

thanks,
robin
