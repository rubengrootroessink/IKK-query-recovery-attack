At this point I think he's looking at trading opportunities.

Is he only interested in trading work or would he be interested in some 
controls work?

I thought I might pass this along your way to see if you had any ideas or 
know of any needs. Win Graham used to work at C&L and looking for trading 
opportunities at Enron. He's not interested the associate program at this 
time.

His employer doesn't know he's looking, but feel free to pass this along to 
anyone who might have or know of a need.

From my exposure to him, he seemed like a great guy that would probably fit 
in well at Enron. Very personable!

Hope things are going well for both of you!

It was good to talk to you again.  Thanks for passing this around.
Hopefully something good will come from it.
