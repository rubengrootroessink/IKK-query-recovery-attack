Subject: Bid Week

Please be prepared to meet with Commercial next week in preparation for 
Bid-Week.  Tentatively scheduled for Tuesday, October 17th.

As in our last meeting, be prepared to discuss any issues regarding your 
pipelines operations which may effect gas flow and trading decisions for the 
month of November.  Also, relay any other "intelligence" gathered from 
marketers, suppliers, or customers.

If you have any questions, please contact Victor or myself.
