Scott,

Yesterday, I received a phone call from Scott Goodell regarding his vacation 
balance.  He and his assistant thought the was a mistake in his vacation 
accrual.  I have researched the issue with the payroll department and the SAP 
team and they see an inconsistency in his account.  

However, Scott says that he was given 3 weeks vacation (120 hours) as part of 
the CES acquisition.  His offer letter does not state the 120 hours up front, 
but we can add this to his balance and correct the problem, if you approve.  
I know he has contacted several people to resolve this, so I'd like to get 
back to him as soon as possible.

Let me know if this is OK,

Thanks,
Jennifer
