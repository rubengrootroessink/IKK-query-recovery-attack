Executive Impact & Influence Program
* IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED - Do Not Delete *

As part of the Executive Impact and Influence Program, each participant
is asked to gather input on the participant's own management styles and
practices as experienced by their immediate manager, each direct report,
and up to eight peers/colleagues.

You have been requested to provide feedback for a participant attending
the next program.  Your input (i.e., a Self assessment, Manager assessment,
Direct Report assessment, or Peer/Colleague assessment) will be combined
with the input of others and used by the program participant to develop an
action plan to improve his/her management styles and practices.

It is important that you complete this assessment
NO LATER THAN CLOSE OF BUSINESS Thursday, September 14.

Since the feedback is such an important part of the program, the participant
will be asked to cancel his/her attendance if not enough feedback is
received.  Therefore, your feedback is critical.
