We will get working on this.

I have no problem with you sitting in on the PRC process.  We are scheduled 
to have this meeting on Nov. 29, however I think there is some chance this 
date might change due to bid week activities.

Scott, great to see you last week even if it was only for a short period.  I 
hear that the Org announcement is scheduled for Tuesday November 14th at 
3:00.  Have you heard the same ?  I will be back in Houston early next week 
for the announcement.  I suggest that you and I plan to meet with the group 
either immediately after the announcement or perhaps after trading the 
following day.  I tend to think that the next day may be better.

In addition, as we discussed I would like to get one of the 
analysts/associates working on pulling the following information together.

List of our states.  maybe there is some overlap with the mid-west but as you 
know this new organization will have everyone focused and we do not want any 
confusion.
Master list of ALL gas users within those states.  If there are any LDC's 
etc. that cross state boundaries or cross regional boundaries we will need to 
know that and make sure Enron coverage is appropriately assigned.  Delainey 
continues to say that he wants to make sure that everyone is covered and 
nothing falls through the cracks.
From the master list we can determine our current level of business and 
relationship with that particular market, high, medium, low.
From Master list we can determine 2001 assignments.


This is fundamental but important in my opinion.



Another issue that I was thinking about is that it would be helpful for me to 
sit in on this years PRC for all members of our staff.  I will not add 
anything but it will give me a sense of how they are doing and what to expect 
as we move forward.  Do you approve of that ?  When is that scheduled ?

I did not get the metrics from Janet yet but am scheduled to do that when I 
am in next week.  I will get you a copy at that time.



Thanks

Frank
