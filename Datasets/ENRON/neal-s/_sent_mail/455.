Subject: PIRA Natural Gas Briefing

PIRA representative, Greg Shuttlesworth will be at Enron on Thursday, July 27 
from 3:00pm - 4:30 pm in EB30C1 to give a natural gas briefing.  This 
briefing is included in the current consultant relationship between PIRA and 
ENA.  This meeting has been rescheduled once again, due to the fact that Greg 
will be unable to travel to Houston any other time in the next few months.  
Please respond to me if you plan to be in attendance for this briefing, if 
you have already responded to the last e-mail, I still have your seat 
reserved and no additional response is necessary.  

Thanks,
Becky Young
