Scott,
Is the purpose of this to find potential candidates and if so, wouldn't you 
want to see who is available within the entire organization?

Jana,

Would it be possible to provide me with a list of all analysts working within 
ENA (along with their current assignments)?

Thank you.

Ted,

Jeanie and I met with Scott Neal (VP Gas Trading East Desk)  yesterday and he 
mentioned that he needs an Analyst as soon as is possible.  Should I contact 
Jana Giovannini or do you send her our request?  

Thanks,
Jennifer
