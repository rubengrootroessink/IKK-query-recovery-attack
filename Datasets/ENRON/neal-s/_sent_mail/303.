Hey could we all get together at 5:00pm today to talk quickly about DP&L and 
the deal structure that works best for us vs. the deal structure that it 
sounds like they are willing to do. 

Stephanie, could you be sure everyone can attend- let's use my conference 
room here on 29- thanks.

We need to try and meet today to be ready for DP&L's response which should 
come tomorrow am.
