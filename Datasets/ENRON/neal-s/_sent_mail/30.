thanks.  I thought it went pretty well and think it is a great idea.  Let's make sure to do this once a month.

Scott, Thanks again for the trading overview you gave our desk today.  It was a great lead-in to future sessions.  Like we agreed, I would like to have these round table discussions once a month.  I'll check with Kimberly to see what your schedule looks like in the future and schedule them.

East Logistics, Please e-mail Scott or myself with topics for future meetings you would be interested in having Scott talk about. 

THANKS Victor
