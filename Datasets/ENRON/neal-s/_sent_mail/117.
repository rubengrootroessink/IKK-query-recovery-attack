Subject: Amerex and Power Merchants Access to EnronOnline

Effective today Amerex and Power Merchants will have id's for 
www.brokerclient.com which will allow them to see prices on EnronOnline.  
Both brokers are putting security in place and once established they will 
also be able to execute transactions for their customers. 

The brokers will have access to the following products:

1. Amerex: World-wide gas, power, crude products and bandwidth
2. Power Merchants: US Financial Gas 

Both agreements include confidentiality language which prohibits discussion 
of the agreement with others.

Any questions relative to these agreements should be directed to me at 713 
853-0397.
