I am Alok's representative for the global Associate PRC meeting on July 19.  
I need some feed back on his performance/ranking for the first half of the 
year.

Your name was given to me as the Representative for Alok Garg, he is being 
promoted from an Associate to a Manager, per Boris Brevnov. If you need
