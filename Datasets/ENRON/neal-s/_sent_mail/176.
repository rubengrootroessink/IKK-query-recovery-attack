as i discussed today listed below is the trade that i would like orgination 
granted on and a summary of the other 
deal i spoke with you about.

bought 5000 dracut from hydroquebec sitara deal number 610884  purchase price 
$6.10 
sold      5000 dracut from conn nat           sitara deal number 610959   
sell price            $6.45
                                                                       
orgination  $1750


additionally on a daily basis i attempt  to market  the tenn zone 5 above the 
cng bid.
usually with success.
the production costs roughly 28 cents at current prices to move to cng.
today the cng two way  was 6.51 by 6.55.  i sold 5800  at $6.48 which is a 
$6.76 cng equivalent or
.25 over the cng bid   or $1450   

i can't try to forward sell this gas because we don't know on a forward basis 
if we are going to have this gas.
i assume that this position would go into the cng position when the books are 
broken out and i can't imagine that
scott will have the time try to market it.  thus if i am spending a 
considerable amount of time in the morning trying to add 
value to the desk with the illiquid assets that we have and i am successful, 
then i feel that signficant quantifiable contributions 
made to the desk should be recognized.
