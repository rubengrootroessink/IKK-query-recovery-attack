Subject: "Strike Out" ALS

Enron/MDA 
Beach Bowl 2000
To Benefit ALS Research

I'm bowling to help "strike out" ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease).  If you have not 
sponsored someone else, I would very much like for you to sponsor me.  The 
event takes place on July 29.  I will need all donations by July 26.

Any donation is greatly appreciated and matched by Enron.

Many Thanks,

Liz
