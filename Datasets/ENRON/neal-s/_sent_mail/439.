Subject: Re: New Notice from Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation  

This one is an exception. I sent out a mail about this site before, about a 
month ago, 
let me explain the situation again.
It is weird that this web site uses such a long line as the URL link for 
their critical notices, 
but Lotus notes can only take the first line starting with http:// as the hot 
link, this is why you see
only the first line was underlined as the link. When you click the partial 
URL link, of course you'll
get an error. To work around this you need to copy the whole five lines, open 
your IE and paste
it to the address box and press "Enter". Let me know if there is still a 
question. Thanks.
