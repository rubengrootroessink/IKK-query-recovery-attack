Scott,

Need your approval on the attached word document as soon as possible.  After 
you have approved it, we can load the critical notice program to the machine 
next to me.  The purpose of requesting a generic ID is so that when there is 
a problem our team (Yan Wang and two other IT persons) can fix it on the 
floor.



Thank you.
