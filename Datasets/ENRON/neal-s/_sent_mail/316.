Just wanted to let everyone know I started a new job last Friday:
    Pipeline Power Partners
    10000 Memorial Drive, Suite 200
    Houston, Texas 77024
    713-290-8762
I'm back working on compressor stations and gas storage projects with some
of the guys I worked with on the Columbia Gas Compressor station in '93-'94.
Note new email address also.

Barry called me last week about the well pump. It was not working and he had
tried everything he knew to do. We decided to call Western Water Well
Service in Conroe to check it out. Bottom line-it was beyond repair and we
had to replace at a cost of $765.52. When our tenant at the time took it
upon himself to dig a new well ($1500) he had them put in a real cheap
pump-so that's why it went out in a relatively short period of time. We now
have only $90 in the account so everyone needs to think about making a
contribution sometime soon. If you have a question, please call.

Conrad
