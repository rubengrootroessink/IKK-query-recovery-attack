Geynille,

I am out of the office this entire week on vacation, so I will be unable to 
participate.

Subject: LSU Cultivation Dinner

Hello LSU Team!!!

As you know, we will be conducting summer intern interviews on March 15th and 
16th.  We did not have the opportunity due to conflicting schedules in the 
Fall to have a cultivation dinner.  I am scheduling a dinner for the Full 
time candidates on March 15th around 7:00 PM to have this dinner.

If anyone's schedule permits other than the scheduled interviewers and 
greeters to attend please let me know.

Thanks a million!!!
