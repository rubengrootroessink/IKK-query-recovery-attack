Dear Southwestern Alumni,

My name is Brooke Davis, and I am taking an Organizational Communication class
at Southwestern University.  A large portion of the class is dedicated to an
intensive class group project centered on the University.  We will study
Southwestern as an organization and apply our research to relevant
Organizational Communication theories.  My class would like to enlist your
help
by asking you to complete the following survey:


How did you first hear about Southwestern?

What were your first impressions of the school?

How did those impressions/views change during the time you spent at
Southwestern?

Have your views about the school changed since you graduated?

Does Southwestern's rank in magazines and books affect how you see
Southwestern?  If so, how, and if not, why?

Are you actively involved with the school, and if so, how?

What do you like about Southwestern, and what would you like to improve?

Do you feel you have any control over what our campus looks like?  Why do you
feel this way?

Which building is the most important building on campus?  Why do you feel this
way?

The campus is continuously filled with more buildings made of
limestone.  Why do
you think the University chooses this type of building material for most all
buildings?

What type of image do you feel is tied into the way this campus has been
designed to look?

Describe the way the Southwestern campus looks in one word:

On a scale of 1-10 (10 being the highest), how important to the University is
aesthetic appearance?

What do you believe is the most important way alumni can be involved with the
University?

How do you feel Southwestern as an organization has changed since you
graduated?
Do you believe these changes are positive or negative and why?

How does the University keep you informed about campus events and
occurrences?
Do you feel the information you receive is sufficient?

How often do you visit the SU Web site?

Do you access the "Alumni Home Page" or the "General Home Page"?

In general, what do you think of the Web site?

Specifically, what images or ideas do you think SU is trying to send to alumni
through the Web site?

What role do you feel you play at Southwestern?

What year did you graduate?

Additional Comments:



Please return responses to me via email at davise@southwestern.edu.  My class
and I greatly appreciate your help.

Sincerely,
Brooke Davis '03
