Dear Real Estate Professional,

We make it simple to reach your Internet customers!  By taking advantage of this offer you can be a part of
our very affordable International Agent Directory which is more easily accessed over the Internet because
each city has it's own dedicated web page which is registered with over 8,000 search engines and
directories.  You can have a 50 word description of yourself with links to your Email(s) and personal web
address(s) for any city that you select for only $20 per year (we do not charge a monthly fee like most
web sites and there are no hidden charges).  We also offer a multiple city discount, which
is six cities for $100.00 (a $120.00 value).  To see a sample please visit
