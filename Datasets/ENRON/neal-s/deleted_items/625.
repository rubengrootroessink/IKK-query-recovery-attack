s, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Ricky Watters , RB SEA - =
Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Watters' shoulder has not sufficiently healed e=
nough for him to practice, says the Seattle Times. He is not expected to re=
turn for another two to three weeks, meaning Shaun Alexander will continue =
to be a key performer for many Fantasy teams as the postseason comes into v=
iew.  Doug Flutie , QB SD - Russell Updated 11/20/01 Mike Riley told the Sa=
n Diego Union-Tribune there is no QB controversy involving Flut! ie! and ro=
okie Drew Brees. "Doug is going to be our quarterback," he said. "You can t=
alk about controversy all you want, but there is none within this building.=
 He is our quarterback. He will start. He will get us the next win the next=
 week." Still, Flutie is not playing well enought to satisfy most Fantasy o=
wners.  Mark Bruener , TE PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Bruener will mi=
ss the rest of the season after undergoing shoulder injury. His loss may ad=
versely affect Jerome Bettis' statistics, because Bruener is widely regarde=
d as the best run-blocking tight end in football.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK=
 - G! ig! gles Updated 11/20/01 Wheatley told the Contra-Costa Times he is =
no longer being bothered by a knee injury. He expects to play on Sunday.  E=
rron Kinney , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Kinney (calf) may play t=
his week after missing three games. He was expected to return to practice e=
arly this week.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Matty Updated 11/20/01 Wycheck (c=
alf) will be limited in practice this week. He may be a risky start in Week=
 11.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 The Tennessean sa=
ys McNair's hand was sore when he arrived at the team's practice facility o=
n Monday. Jeff Fisher now says he doesn't expect him to miss any practice t=
ime this week.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - JWillie Updated 11/20/01 Alexa=
nder (ribs) has returned to practice. He is expected to start against Seatt=
le.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Free Agent Up! da! ted 11/20/01  Minnis (ankle=
) is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game. Larry Parker may have to start i=
n his place,  Mark Brunell , QB JAC - JWillie Updated 11/20/01 Brunell (qua=
driceps) might miss Sunday's game against Baltimore. Jonathan Quinn will st=
art again if Brunell can't play.  Mark Brunell , QB JAC - JWillie Updated 1=
1/20/01 Brunell (quadriceps) might miss Sunday's game against Baltimore. Jo=
nathan Quinn will start again if Brunell can't play.  Reggie Wayne , WR IND=
 - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Wayne has a sprained knee ligament, and is d=
oubtful for Sunday's game against New Orleans. Terrence Wilkins may have to=
 start in his place.  Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Tori Updated 11/20/01 Pathon=
 (foot) is done for the season. He will be put on injured reserve. Reggie W=
ayne (knee) is also hurting, meaning Terrence Wilkins might have to be move=
d back into the starting lineup.   Jay Fiedler  , QB MIA - Tori Updated 11/=
20/01 Dave Wannstedt told the Miami Herald there is no QB controversy surro=
unding Fielder and backup Ray right now. ``That's kind of hypothetical,'' h=
e said. ``Jay is the starter, and my only comment is we're going to get it =
squared away and play turnover-free football.''  Rod Smith , WR DEN - Matty=
 Updated 11/20/01 Mike Shanahan said he does not know if Smith (ankle) will=
 be sufficiently healed to play in Thursday's game against the Cowboys. "We=
'll get a chance to evaluate that during the week and see," Shanahan told t=
he Denver Post. "If he can help our football team, he'll play. If he's in a=
 situation where he can't perform at the level that we think! c! an help ou=
r team, then we'll keep him out and put somebody else in."   Benjamin Gay ,=
 RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 The Cleveland Plain-Dealer says Butch=
 Davis won't indicate how much Gay will play in the near future. "We'll try=
 to get him involved in some of the games," Davis said. "We'll see."   Kevi=
n Lockett , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Lockett, who suffered a ri=
b injury last weekend against Denver, expects to play on Sunday against Phi=
ladelphia. However, the wide receiver has no real value as a Fantasy player=
 at this point.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Barring=
 any setbacks, Banks will start Sunday's game against Philadelphia. Banks, =
who suffered a concussion last weekend vs. Denver, hasn't been feeling any =
after effects of the injury and should be under center for the 'Skins.   Ja=
cquez Green , WR TB - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Green (abdomen) is! e! xp=
ected to return to practice on Wednesday at full strength. He's been incons=
istent this season, and is best used when the matchup is favorable.   Terre=
ll Owens , WR SF - Martin Updated 11/20/01 Owens suffered a sprained left k=
nee and ankle during the overtime session of last weekend's game against Ca=
rolina. The injuries aren't considered serious, however, and Owens is expec=
ted to be in the starting lineup on Sunday Indianapolis.   Cecil Martin , R=
B PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Martin suffered a hamstring injury duri=
ng Sunday's game against Dallas. He'll miss a few days of practice, but is =
expected to play in this weekend's game against Washington. Martin has no r=
eal value as a Fantasy player at this point.    Giants , DT NYG - Matty Upd=
ated 11/20/01 According to the New York Post, cornerback Jason Sehorn's sur=
gically-repaired right knee began giving him problems again this past weeke=
nd. In fact, the team was unsure that he'd be able to cover either Randy Mo=
ss or Cris Carter on Monday night, but he played anyway. If he continues to=
 play on a bad wheel, you should consider starting any receivers opposing S=
ehorn the rest of the season.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Free Agent Updated 1=
1/20/01 The Baltimore Sun says there is no indication that Grbac will be re=
placed as the team's starting QB. Still, he is not performing well enough t=
o start for most Fantasy teams.  Donald Driver , WR GB - Free Agent Updated=
 11/20/01 Driver is still dealing with a thigh injury, and is expected to m=
iss Thursday's game against Detroit. The reserve wideout has no real value =
as a Fantasy player at this point.    Ravens , DT BAL - Ru! ss! ell Updated=
 11/20/01 Defensive end Michael McCrary will miss the rest of the season af=
ter undergoing knee surgery. His loss will certainly lower the sack output =
of the Baltimore defense and may mean the team will allow more passing yard=
age than usual.    Cowboys , DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Linebacke=
r Dexter Coakley, who was expected to miss two weeks due to a sprained knee=
, will likely get the start on Thursday after being out for just one game. =
He'll help keep Denver's running game in check, but don't expect his presen=
ce to give Dallas' defense added Fantasy value as a whole.   Emmitt Smith ,=
 RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/20/01 Smith (knee) will start on Thursday's =
game against Denver. "I'm not 100 percent, but I'm healthy enough to do my =
job," Smith told the Dallas Morning Star. He'll struggle to post solid Fant=
asy numbers due to Dallas' horrid passing game, so bench him this week if a=
t all possible.     Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/20/01 Hayes s=
uffered bruised ribs during Sunday's game against San Francisco. He may mis=
s some practice time this week, but he's expected to play this weekend agai=
nst Atlanta. The Falcons secondary is one of the worst in the league, so Ha=
yes could turn into a good sleeper pick in Week 1! 1.!   Terry Hardy , TE A=
RI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Hardy is expected to return to practice th=
is week after missing three games due to shoulder injury. However, he is no=
t certain to play on Sunday against San Diego.   Jackie Harris , TE DAL - F=
ree Agent Updated 11/20/01 Harris is out for Thursday's game against Denver=
 due to a hamstring injury. Harris has been an unreliable Fantasy player an=
d is only worth a roster spot in deeper leagues.   More Updates  [IMAGE]  C=
