Barry: Sorry to hear you have been sick. Hope you are feeling better.
We have no plans to be up this week end, but we are discussing a work day
for a week end soon.
You are welcome to use the picnic table this week end or anytime.
I submitted the estimate of damages to the District Attoney's office soon
after I asked you for it, but haven't heard anything on the final outcome of
the case.

Conrad
