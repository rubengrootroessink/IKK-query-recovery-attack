re at StockUpTicks we try to be very selective regarding the companies that=
 we expose to our membership. Since we're not a "pump", "tout", or  "hype" =
service and don't render opinion about our featured companies, we'll never =
pressure you to buy or sell these stocks.  However, we are very proud of th=
e performance of our featured companies.  Before you read about BioSecure, =
today's featured company, take a look at how each of the companies we've fe=
atured over the last couple of months have performed.    All percentages be=

Company is BioSecure (OTCBB: YCCI)   (Presently Known As Yes Clothing Co.  =
Inc)    As company's inevitably succeed or fail in the publicly traded aren=

 reverse merger. In this instance, BioSecure has acquired the "shell" of Ye=
s Clothing Co. for its own purposes.  Obviously, Yes Clothing Co. is no lon=
