his right shoulder revealed no structural damage and no tie to his previous=

 Rob Johnson , QB BUF - Giggles Updated 10/16/01 Johnson has been listed as=
 probable for Thursday's game in Jacksonville despite a neck injury. He has=
n't been a reliable Fantasy quarterback all year, and there's no reason to =

 Updated 10/16/01 According to Eagles' coach Andy Reid, Staley will be the =

ugh to play him Fantasy-wsie.   Joe Jurevicius , WR NYG - Free Agent Update=
d 10/16/01 Jurevicius suffered a rib injury during Sunday's game against St=

Tiki Barber , RB NYG - Neal/McKay Updated 10/16/01 Barber (hamstring) is ex=
pected to return to practice on Thursday. Barring any setbacks, Barber will=

suffered a concussion during Sunday's loss to Chicago, and was dealing with=
 headaches on Monday as a result. He is expected to undergo tests, and is s=

ole once again.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - Russell Updated 10/16/01 Moss is de=
aling with a sprained right ankle, which may keep him from playing at full =
capacity this weekend against Green Bay. It's tough to ever bench Moss, but=

r allows for a solid replacement.   Doug Chapman , RB MIN - Free Agent Upda=
ted 10/16/01 Chapman is expected to get the starting nod this weekend again=
st Green Bay due to Michael Bennett's ankle injury. Chapman may be worth pi=
cking up for the week in deeper leagues, but he'll be hard-pressed to put u=

t (ankle) is expected to miss this weekend's game against Green Bay. He was=
