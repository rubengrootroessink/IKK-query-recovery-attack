Victor,

First, I want to thank you so much for all of the opportunities that you have afforded me here on the East desk this past year as well as for your wisdom and direction.  Regretfully, my last day of employment here at ENRON will be Tuesday, February 5, 2002.  

I hope that UBS will be especially gracious to you and that you will do great things with the new company.  And again, thank you so much for everything.

Sincerely,

Lia M. Halstead
