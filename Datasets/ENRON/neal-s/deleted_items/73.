I know you  guys may be  still in the hiring mode.  I've attached 2 resumes
that are worth a look.  

Beth Jenkins is a senior commercial person with extensive derivatives knowledge and industry experience.  She has 
a trading background but has interest in pursuing Origination opportunities also.
 


Vickie Versen worked for me most recently trading physical gas in 
the Gulf and previous scheduled on several East pipes.  I think she 
has interest in considering either trading or scheduling.
