One Allen Center
Houston, TX

Dear Keri,

This letter should serve as notification that I wish to terminate my
membership effective as soon as possible.  As you are probably aware, the
Enron Body Shop has recently reopened where I have a membership.  Thank you
for your assistance with my
membership and termination.  Please contact me should you have any questions
or need additional information.


Sincerely,





Scott M. Neal
