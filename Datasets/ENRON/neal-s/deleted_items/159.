I just wanted to touch base with you to let you know that the new season
clothing line is in!  The focus this season is on color.  Basic colors for
suits, sport coats and trousers are highlighted with a splash of color in
shirts to give you a new youthful, but distinguished look.

Fabrics are light and airy for the warmer climate ahead.

Don't forget to make room for a "home run suit".  Even if you don't wear
suits every day, you need at least one that makes a BIG impression.

For more about the new line, please call me or e-mail me to make an
appointment.

Thanks!
