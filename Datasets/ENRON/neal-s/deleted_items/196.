PAVING STONE CORPORATION REPORTS 23% INCREASE IN 2001 FULL YEAR
REVENUES TO $31.5 MILLION

POMPANO BEACH, Fla., Jan. 14 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Paving
Stone Corporation (OTC Bulletin Board: PVNG), a market leader
in the interlocking concrete paver installation business
nationwide, today announced that its revenues for the 2001
fiscal year had increased by 23% to $31.5 million
compared with revenues of $25.5 million for the 2000 fiscal year.

For the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2001, revenues were
$8.9 million compared with $7.3 million in the 2000 fourth
quarter, an increase of 22%. The increased revenues were
attributed to the continued growth of the Company's core offices
in Florida, Georgia and Arizona and the successful expansion into
California, Nevada, Texas and the Carolinas.

The Company said that it expects to release its 2001 fourth
quarter and full year financial results in late March 2002.

Maurice Sigouin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of
Paving Stone Corporation, stated: "Paving Stone Corporation
has established a leading nationwide position in the
interlocking paving stone installation industry. The increase
in our year-end and fourth quarter revenues reflect the ongoing
implementation of our strategy to expand our national footprint
while achieving operational efficiencies."

The Company plans to continue to expand its position in the
marketplace through internal growth and the acquisition of
quality independent businesses in strategic markets. As a
premier paver installation and design company in the country,
Paving Stone Corporation believes it is poised to capture a
dominant market share in this expanding marketplace. According
to the Interlocking Concrete Pavement Institute, the industry's
trade association, while the annual installations of pavers
has quadrupled in the U.S. over the last 20 years, the U.S.
market of 300 million square feet of annual installation is
still a fraction of the annual installation rate in Europe.

Mr. Sigouin continued: "We built this business on the
foundation of quality work and customer satisfaction.
Our company's growth is indicative of our thousands of
satisfied customers since 1990. Yet we realize there
are a vast number of potential customers that have yet
to learn about the cost advantages and convenience of
interlocking paving stones for commercial and residential
landscape and infrastructure applications.

"We are already expanding our national footprint and
bringing certain services in-house. By doing so, we have
the ability to generate up to three times the revenues on
a per square foot basis (as in a residential installation
in locations other than our Florida base). With this business
model, we expect to be able to substantially increase the
revenues per job, compared with jobs of similar size in our
Florida base. When one adds the components of geographic
expansion, increasing market share with large increases in
revenues on a per square foot basis, which result in higher
revenue per job, we have the potential for strong bottom line
growth."
