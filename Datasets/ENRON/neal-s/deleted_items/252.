Here is the story...November production..we purchased $3.1 MM of gas and sold $3.9 MM.  On December 31, MGI paid us the gross amount. According to Jaime, we have no formal netting agreement nor have we ever netted in the past.  MGI assumed that once they paid the 3.9 we would pay the 3.1.  We did not.  Post-petition payment but pre-petition contract.  We do not have a master, and I assume we confirmed using GTCs; Jaime did indicate that the volumes were comprised of several deals.  He wants to know if he is going to get paid.  I did not want to comment and told him that I would pass to you and gave him your name.  Does he have a pre-petition or administrative claim?  He spoke to someone in settlements and told me that person (did not have name) indicated they could not pay him because of the bankruptcy. Jamie's number is below.

Thanks,
Tanya

Can you call Jaime at MGI/Pemex regarding payments between MGI and Enron?  I think they need an explanation
regarding how payments are made within the bankruptcy proceeding.

Jaime can be reached at 011525 55 232 5996.

Thank you.
