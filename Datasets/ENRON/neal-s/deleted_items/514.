njury. However, he is expected to play in this week's game.   Kevin Dyson! =
, WR TEN - Bass/Hull Updated 10/23/01Dyson is recovering from a thumb injur=
y but is expected to play in Monday's game against the Steelers. He is expe=
cted to participate in practice. Eddie George , RB TEN - Tori Updated 10/23=
/01 George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play=
 in this week's game.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Martin Updated 10/23/01 McN=
air is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. =
However, he is expected to play in this week's game.   Chris Sanders  , WR =
TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 The Tennessean reports that Sanders has a=
 disc problem in his back. The reserve receiver is expected to see a specia=
list this week. Treatment options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery=
. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play =
in his absence.   Damon Jones , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Jones =
is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showe=
d that his injury would not require surgery.   Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Marti=
n Updated 10/23/01 Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Balti=
more and his status for next week's game remains uncertain. "All I know is =
that, from week to week, they increase his exercises and change of directio=
n," head coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida Times-Union. "It remains to be=
 seen when Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he respo=
nds well this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a=
 return date] next week." Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring =
his groin on Sept 23.     Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10=
/23/01 Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected=
 to play when the Browns return to action next week.   Todd Heap , TE BAL -=
 Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian =
Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic that the rookie will play i=
n this week's game. Heap has been inactive for the last four games because =
of a sprained ankle.   Terry Allen , RB BAL - Tori Updated 10/23/01 Allen, =
who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is qu=
estionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at running back =
if Allen is inactive.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Tori Updated 10/23/01 Coach =
Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonvi=
lle, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. "I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling prett=
y sore in the chest area," Grbac said Monday. "There could be something goi=
ng on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so w=
e'll just have to wait and see." Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if h=
e is unable to play.     Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Neal/McKay Updated 10/23=
/01 Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New Y=
ork Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game a=
gainst New Orleans.   Trung Canidate , RB STL - Giggles Updated 10/23/01 Ac=
cording to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in pl=
ace of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. "I wouldn't expect =
Marshall to be up for this game," coach Mike Martz said. "He's got to be 10=
0 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And i=
f he's not, then he doesn't play." Canidate proved himself as a worthy repl=
acement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy=
 perspective again this week.     J.J. Stokes , WR SF - Matty Updated 10/23=
/01 Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is c=
lose to being completely healthy. "Thankfully the bye week came so early. I=
t was a blessing for me because I was ab! le! to get treatment every day," =
Stokes told the Contra Costa Times . "I practiced today good. I wouldn't sa=
y I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close." Stokes has been less than mediocre, =
however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to =
be more reliable.   Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - Russell Updated 10/23/01 Hillia=
rd continues to improve each week, and could be back in the Giants' startin=
g lineup within the next few weeks. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches=
 for 80 yards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though hi=
s surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed.   Ron Dixon , WR NY=
G - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01!  Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to =
the Philadelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day=
-to-day.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Matty Updated 10/23/01 According to He=
ad Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Or=
leans. "I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago," Martz sai=
d. "I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got t=
o be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play." =
Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to =
go.    Anthony Wright , QB DAL - Free Agent! Updated 10/23/01 Wright is exp=
ected to start Sunday's game against Arizona despite swelling in his right =
knee. Ryan Leaf could see some action in the game, however, so starting Wri=
ght from a Fantasy perspective isn't advisable.   Dez White , WR CHI - Free=
 Agent Updated 10/23/01 According to the Chicago Sun-Times, White will star=
t in place of the injured Marcus Robinson. White has struggled with his bal=
l-catching abilities, however, so be cautious in picking him up outside of =
deeper leagues.   David Terrell , WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 ! Te=
! rrell will not start at wide receiver in place of the injured Marcus Robi=
nson, as was reportedly earlier. The Chicago Sun-Times is now reporting tha=
t Dez White will start in place of Robinson, with Terrell being used as the=
 team's third receiver.   Tony Martin , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/0=
1 Martin will have an X-ray on his broken right collarbone this week. The t=
eam feels confident that Martin will be available for their Nov. 11 game ag=
ainst Dallas, so Fantasy owners should keep him on reserve until then.   Ro=
b Moore , WR ARI - Martin Updated 10/23/01 According to Cardinals coach Dav=
e McGinnis, Moore may not play a regular season g! am! e this season. Moore=
, who has been dealing with a hamstring injury, continues to have setbacks =
in his recovery. "I was hoping we'd see him by now, McGinnis told the Arizo=
na Republic. "That's why we both handled it like we did in training camp an=
d we paced him. We were planning to have him from the start. I can't tell y=
ou when he'll be back. Until he can practice for a couple of weeks, we won'=
t have him." If Moore is still on your Fantasy roster, now is the time to l=
et him go.   Tiki Barber , RB NYG - Neal/McKay Updated 10/22/01 Barber, who=
 is probable with a hamstring injury, is expected to play Monday night agai=
nst Philadelphia. Still, he will not get many carries, as Ron Dayne is expe=
cted to get the bulk of the work. Barber might be on the verge of losing th=
e starting job outright for the remainder of the season.  Richard Huntley ,=
 RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Panthers Head Coach George Seifert sa=
id Monday that Huntley will enter Week Seven as the team's starting tailbac=
k. "He has progressed from the standpoint that he is now healthy," said Sei=
fert. "Here's a golden opportunity." See if Huntley is still available in y=
our league, as he looks to be the first player given a shot to claim the Ca=
rolina starting RB job.  Jacquez Green , WR TB - Free Agent Updated 10/22/0=
1 Green suffered a left hip sprain during Sunday's game against Pittsburgh.=
 The injury will prevent him from practicing much this week, and could keep=
 him out of next Sunday's game against Minnesota. Monitor Green's progress =
during the week before deciding whether to use him in Week ! Se! ven.  Keys=
hawn Johnson , WR TB - Giggles Updated 10/22/01 Johnson was sidelined for t=
he final minutes of Sunday's game against Pittsburgh due to a right hip fle=
xor strain. He will be limited in practice this week and could miss next Su=
nday's game against Minnesota. Keep an eye on Johnson's progress this week =
as you prepare your lineup for Week Seven.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Martin U=
pdated 10/22/01 Dunn suffered a strained right hamstring during Sunday's ga=
me against Pittsburgh. "I don't know what kind of situation we're going to =
be in," Bucs Head Coach Tony Dungy t! ol! d the St. Petersburg Times . "War=
rick pulled a muscle, and he may be out a little while. So I don't know who=
 it'll be carrying the load." Dunn's backup, Aaron Stecker, is also injured=
, so be careful considering starting any Tampa Bay running backs in Week Se=
ven.  Brett Favre , QB GB - Frank Updated 10/22/01 Favre injured his right =
elbow in the final seconds of Sunday's game at Minnesota. Fortunately, the =
Packers have a bye week in Week Seven, so he should have time to recover. "=
It'll be OK," Favre told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. "Thank goodness I =
have a week to relax. I think that will help."  James Stewart , RB DET - ! =
H! unter Updated 10/22/01 Stewart left Sunday's game against Tennessee in t=
he fourth quarter with a sprained right ankle. He is listed as day to day, =
and Lamont Warren finished the game in his absence.  More Updates [IMAGE]  =
