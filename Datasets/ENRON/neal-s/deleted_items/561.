layer News   Redskins , DT WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Cornerback Cha=
mp Bailey missed practice on Wednesday due to a sprained ankle, but he's ex=
pected to play on Sunday. Fred Smoot (leg), however, is in danger of missin=
g this weekend's contest against Carolina. Darrell Green would replace Smoo=
t if he's unable to go.   Rob Moore , WR ARI - Martin Updated 10/17/01 Moor=
e (hamstring) is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Kansas City. =
He hasn't been full speed at practice, how! ev! er, so don't consider him F=
antasy-wise just yet.   Patrick Jeffers , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/17=
/01 Jeffers (knees) saw extensive work in practice today and may be ready t=
o play this weekend against New Orleans. However, Jeffers is too risky to s=
tart from a Fantasy perspective.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Martin Update=
d 10/17/01 Muhammad's ribs are still sore after taking a few shots during S=
unday's game against New Orleans. Coach George Seifert expects him to play,=
 but he may be somewhat limited. Unless his status improves by the end of t=
he week, Fantasy owners may want to consider benching Muhammad i! f ! at al=
l possible.   Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Tori Updated 10/17/01 Weinke missed p=
ractice on Wednesday due to a thigh injury. However, Head Coach George Seif=
ert expects the rookie quarterback to start on Sunday against Washington. I=
f you need a quarterback this week, Weinke is a good choice facing a terrib=
le Redskins' defense.   Terance Mathis , WR ATL - Frank Updated 10/17/01 Ma=
this (hand) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to start on S=
unday against New Orleans, but he's only worth starting in deeper leagues f=
rom a Fantasy perspective.    Shawn Jefferson, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated =
10/17/01 Jefferson (toe) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected =
to be in the starting lineup on Sunday against New Orleans, but he's too un=
reliable to use Fantasy-wise.   Ryan Leaf , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/=
17/01 Leaf worked with he first team offense during practice on Wednesday. =
He was filling in for Anthony Wright, who was given the day off to rest his=
 swollen right knee. Leaf will have his chance to win the starting job in D=
allas, but he has no real Fantasy value at this time.   Troy Hambrick , RB =
DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Now that Robert Thomas is gone for the ye=
ar, Hambrick is expected to become Dallas' starting fullback. He's shown fl=
ashes of brilliance at times, but his value as a Fantasy player is still mi=
nimal at this point.   Michael Bennett , RB MIN - Matty Updated 10/17/01 Be=
nnett is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a ri=
ght ankle injury. Expect Doug Chapman to get the start, with Travis Prentic=
e serving as his backup. Don't use Bennett this week.  Randy Moss , WR MIN =
- Russell Updated 10/17/01 Moss is listed as questionable for Sunday's game=
 against Green Bay with a right ankle injury. While we normally tell you to=
 start him every week, this is one matchup we wouldn't activate him for unl=
ess it becomes completely clear he will start.  Shane Matthews , QB CHI - F=
ree Agent Updated 10/17/01 The Bears re-signed Matthews on Tuesday. He retu=
rns to his old backup QB job and isn't worth adding to your Fantasy roster.=
  Terrell Davis , RB DEN - JWillie Updated 10/17/01 According to published =
reports, Davis would like to return to the line! up! Sunday at San Diego. H=
e has recovered from a knee injury, and Broncos Head Coach Mike Shanahan wa=
nts him to return by November 4. We don't recommend you use Davis this week=
, although this development also makes it tough to recommend you start any =
Broncos running back.   Stacey Mack , RB JAC - Hunter Updated 10/17/01 Mack=
 will get a lot of carries this week but don't expect him to be too product=
ive. He only gained 17 yards on nine carries in the Jaguars' previous.   Ke=
enan McCardell , WR JAC - Neal/McKay Updated 10/17/01 McCardell struggled i=
n his first few games back from injury, but looked like his old self in the=
 previous game. Look for McCardell to play well this week and catch a lot o=
f passes.    Sean Dawkins , WR JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Dawkins wi=
ll have a tough time against Buffalo this week. He will catch of couple of =
passes but won't find his way into the end zone.   Mark Brunell , QB JAC - =
JWillie Updated 10/17/01 Brunell is no longer being bothered by headaches a=
nd is expected to play in Week Six. Look for him to throw for over 200 yard=
s and a score.     Kyle Brady , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Brady =
is expected to play in this week's game despite a hip injury, and is listed=
 as probable. H! e ! won't be too productive if he does play. Brady only ha=
s five catches this season.   Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - Frank Updated 10/17/01=
 Smith has been very consistent this season. Look for him to catch several =
passes and score a touchdown against Buffalo.  Herman Moore , WR DET - Free=
 Agent Updated 10/17/01 Moore will miss the remainder of the season after t=
earing a muscle in his hip during Sunday's game at Minnesota. "We're disapp=
ointed the injury is much worse than we thought," Lions Head Coach Marty Mo=
rnhinweg said. "We believed it was a minor pull, but the MRI showed a signi=
ficant tear in the muscle." Drop Moore if he was on your Fantasy team.! L! =
arry Foster assumes the No. 3 receiver job in Detroit.  Tyrone Wheatley , R=
B OAK - Giggles Updated 10/17/01 According to published reports, Wheatley w=
ill miss three to four weeks with a right knee sprain. The veteran back was=
 beginning to lose carries to Charlie Garner before he was hurt.  Charlie G=
arner , RB OAK - Russell Updated 10/17/01 The Contra-Costa Times points out=
 Garner has apparently supplanted Tyrone Wheatley as the team's "workhorse"=
 back. The trend was apparent before Wheatley was reported to miss three to=
 four weeks with a knee injury.  Travis Henry  , RB BUF - Martin Updated 10=
/17/01 Henry told the Buffalo News he plans to have minor surgery on both k=
nees after the season. Henry has tendinitis in both knees, but it will not =
affect him during the regular season.  Jay Riemersma , TE BUF - Free Agent =
Updated 10/17/01 The Buffalo News says the Bills want to get Riemersma more=
 involved in the offense now that tackles Jonas Jennings and John Fina are =
healthy again. Riemersma was being asked to block more often early in the y=
ear, but he will now become more involved in the passing game.  Jerome Path=
on , WR IND - Tori Updated 10/17/01 It is not clear if Pathon (foot) will b=
e able to play this week against the Patriots. Pathon missed Sunday's game =
against Oakland. Reggie Wayne would start in Pathon's place if he cannot pl=
ay again.  Dedric Ward , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 The Miami Her=
ald says Ward had his foor placed in a boot because he had a problem with s=
tress protection. The Dolphins do not know when he will return.  Emmitt Smi=
th , RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 10/17/01 According to the Dallas Morning St=
ar, Smith could end up splitting more carries with Troy Hambrick in the com=
ing weeks. Head Coach Dave Campo believes the two backs complement each oth=
er very well, and that the move will keep Smith fresh for a longer duration=
 on game day.   Stephen Alexander , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Al=
exander underwent an MRI on his injured right ankle Monday, which revealed =
a high sprain. He is expected to miss at least two weeks of action due to t=
he injury, so be sure to reserve him if he is still on your roster.   Micha=
el Pittman , RB ARI - Matty Updated 10/17/01 Pittman, who suffered a concus=
sion during Sunday's loss to Chicago, is expected to practice on Tuesday. H=
is status for this weekend's game against Kansas City is questionable, but =
he is expected to play.  Greg Clark , TE SF - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 C=
lark went through his most extensive workout since undergoing surgery on hi=
s right hamstring three weeks ago. "It was encouraging," Clark told the Con=
tra Costa Times. "I ran (a half mile). I never could do any of that before =
the last surgery (which removed his semitendonosis tendon). The most I coul=
d do was jog two minutes. It's an amazing difference in comparison." Head C=
oach Steve Mariucci doesn't know when Clark will be healthy enough to make =
his season debut, however, but he did rule Clark out for their Oct. 28 game=
 against Chicago.    More Updates  Player! N! ews Teams  [IMAGE]  Neal/McKa=
y Player News  Keenan McCardell , Reserve WR Updated 10/17/01 McCardell str=
uggled in his first few games back from injury, but looked like his old sel=
f in the previous game. Look for McCardell to play well this week and catch=
 a lot of passes.   Lamar Smith , Active RB Updated 10/16/01 Smith was in a=
 walking boot after suffering a sprained ankle during Sunday's game against=
 the Jets, according to the Miami Herald. He should be fine for Week Seven =
when the Dolphins return from the bye week.  Tony Richardson , Reserve RB U=
pdated 10/16/01 Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermeil said Monday there is a chanc=
e Richardson could play Sunday in Arizona, according to the Kansas City Sta=
r. Richardson is battling a shoulder injury.  Tiki Barber , Reserve RB Upda=
ted 10/16/01 Barber (hamstring) is expected to return to practice on Thursd=
ay. Barring any setbacks, Barber will be available for Monday's game agains=
t Philadelphia. With the emergence of Ron Dayne, however, Barber may see a =
drop in his Fantasy value over the coming weeks.   Vinny Testaverde , Reser=
ve QB Updated 10/14/01 Testaverde had a good outing against Miami, throwing=
 for 168 yards and two touchdowns. He's still not worth starting ever week,=
 but Testaverde is very useful Fantasy-wise when the matchup is right.   Ro=
n Dayne , Reserve RB Updated 10/14/01 Dayne started on Sunday against St. L=
ouis despite a neck injury. He rushed for 88 yards and a score in New York'=
s 15-14 loss, and may be solidifying his grasp on the featured back role fo=
r the G-Men.   Peyton Manning , Active QB Updated 10/12/01 Manning should t=
hrow at least two TD passes against Oakland. The Raiders' secondary runs ho=
t and cold, and sometimes has trouble with marquee quarterbacks.  Jerry Ric=
e , Active WR Updated 10/12/01 Rice should have another good outing. He sho=
uld draw inexperienced Indianapolis CB David Macklin in coverage, which mea=
ns Rice will definitely be a TD threat again this week.  Freddie Jones , Ac=
tive TE Updated 10/12/01 Jones has been a disappointment so far this year. =
Don't count on good numbers from him this week, because the Chargers will f=
eature the run against New England.  Mike Anderson , Active RB Updated 10/1=
2/01 Expect excellent numbers from Anderson this week. He always plays well=
 against Seattle, and the Seahawks still lack the talent to stop him from g=
aining big chunks of yardage as the game wears on.  Az-Zahir Hakim , Active=
 WR Updated 09/08/01 Hakim might see a few passes thrown his way during the=
 Rams' season opener Sunday in Philadelphia. However, his offensive potenti=
al is limited as a No. 3 receiving threat, so his Fantasy ceiling isn't ver=
y high.  Shawn Bryson , Reserve RB Updated 08/23/01 Bryson suffered a sprai=
ned ankle during practice on Thursday. He was scheduled to have X-rays late=
r in the day, but the team has diagnosed it as a simple sprain at this poin=
t. Bryson, who will be a game-time decision for this weekend's game at Cinc=
innati, is worth a later-round flier at best on Draft Day.   Broncos , Acti=
ve DT Updated 08/23/01 Defensive tackle Chester McGlockton, who suffered a =
slight ligament tear in his knee during Monday's preseason game, is expecte=
d to be ready for the start of the regular season. Denver's defense has the=
 talent to be a solid unit from a Fantasy perspective, and will be one of t=
he top ten defenses taken on Draft Day.   Matt Stover , Active K Updated 12=
/08/00 Stover needs just nine more field goals over the final three weeks o=
f the season to break the NFL single-season record of 39 (Olindo Mare, 1999=
). Expect him to get plenty of chances against San Diego on Sunday, and ens=
ure that he's in your active playoff lineup each week.   [IMAGE]  Copyright=
