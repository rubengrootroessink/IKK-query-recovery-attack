Scott - 

It went to UBS on Friday overnight delivery.  I have asked Karen to check to make sure they did not receive it yesterday.

I have received a note from UBS to say they have not received your employement application form.  Pls completed the attached form and return to me.   Please ensure the following:

1.	You put city and state in the school/college section 
2.	You complete a 10 year history of work (if in College/not working/ etc  please state with dates).
