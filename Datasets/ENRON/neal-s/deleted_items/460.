GE]  MA Union News Reports New Smith & Wesson Super-Light Guns   Could Be C=
arried By Flight Crews On Commercial Airliners  In the Spring of this year,=
 Stockupticks brought you the story of a small-cap company that produced fi=
rearm safety and security products. That company,  Saf-T-Hammer (OTC BB: SA=
FH) later acquired legendary gun manufacturer Smith & Wesson. One of the pr=
oducts in development at that time was a gun made from a new, lightweight, =
exotic-metal alloy making the gun easier to carry and conceal. Due to inter=
est in using this weapon for arming flight crews on commercial airliners, t=
he dealer response has been tremendous.    [IMAGE]  (see article below)    =
   [IMAGE]  Business News   Lightweight revolvers hot item for S&W   Wednes=
day, October 24, 2001  By WILLIAM FREEBAIRN    A new line of ultra-light re=
volvers in stores this month is proving a success for Smith & Wesson, which=
 can't keep up with demand. The new guns are among the first in the world t=
o use scandium, a metal that has been used in Russian fighter jets and base=
ball bats. They are being marketed under the AirLite Sc label and all are c=
apable of firing a powerful .357-caliber Magnum round that had been previou=
sly unavailable in such a lightweight gun.    The smaller revolvers, which =
weight just over 11 ounces, have been shipping for several weeks; larger gu=
ns should reach dealers in the coming days.   "It's a hot item," said Herb =
A. Belin, handgun product manager for Smith & Wesson. "Our constraint is ou=
r production rate." The guns are more expensive than stainless-steel revolv=
ers. New guns carry a suggested price of between $700 and $800 each.    The=
 lighter guns are likely to be purchased by people who want them for person=
al defense, especially those with permits to carry concealed weapons, Belin=
 said. Officials said developing the guns using the new metal took longer t=
han expected and taught them some lessons in metallurgy. In high-speed vide=
o footage of the gun firing, the frame and barrel moved dramatically due to=
 the scandium alloy's flexibility. "That gun does the rumba," Belin said.  =
  Designers increased the size of some parts of the gun to reduce flexing. =
Titanium was used in the cylinder for strength, but testing showed it was a=
lso needed in the center pin and other parts of the weapon. Steel is used f=
or the hammer and trigger. "This taught us to make even stronger, tougher g=
uns," Belin said.    Scandium is a little-known metal that occupies a place=
 on the periodic table immediately before titanium. Discovered in the late =
1800s, it found use in the former Soviet Union, which had a virtual monopol=
y on the supply from the Ukraine. The Soviets used it in fighter jets and m=
issile parts. When the Soviet Union broke up, the metal began to see more w=
idespread use, for example in aluminum baseball bats and mountain bike fram=
es.    Although scandium costs about $7,000 a pound, the amount needed to m=
ix with aluminum and other alloying agents is small. Adding a little scandi=
um to aluminum strengthens the material more than twofold, Belin said.    I=
ts weight will increase the number of people willing to carry it, Belin sai=
d. "You don't need a holster. You can carry it in your pocket."    The ligh=
test of the scandium guns is less than half of the weight of the lightest .=
357-caliber Magnum the company made before. Because of their light weight a=
nd flexible scandium-aluminum alloy frame, the guns deliver a rapid "kick" =
to the hands of the person firing them. "Recoil is an issue," Belin said.  =
  The gun can fire less-powerful rounds than the .357 magnum, for example t=
he .38 special, that can reduce recoil. "You really have to work at not fli=
nching (when firing,)" Belin said.    Smith & Wesson officials believe ther=
e may be another market for the super-light guns. They have developed a pro=
totype scandium alloy gun that could be carried by flight crews on commerci=
al airliners. There have been calls for flight crews to be armed, although =
no steps have been taken by the government in that direction.    The Smith =
& Wesson prototypes are black with an internal hammer, so they could be car=
ried in a trouser or jacket pocket without catching on the fabric. The guns=
 could be modified to fire a lower-velocity round, which is less likely to =
cause damage to an aircraft, officials said.    The prototype air crew guns=
 have not been publicly revealed before, Belin said. A spokesman said the p=
rototypes are simply a design concept and will not necessarily be produced =
or be shared with people outside the company.    ? 2001 UNION-NEWS.    ABOU=
