Jon Mckay will manage Brad's products.  What products had we assigned to Pete?

Scott,

Now that we know which traders will be moving over, or we should, we need to make a second pass at the EOL product list.  Can you confirm with your desk heads that the list of names we have is correct, and then update the product mappings by tomorrow afternoon?
