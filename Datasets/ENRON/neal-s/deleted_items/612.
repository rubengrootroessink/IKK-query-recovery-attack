Scott/Mike

	I was speaking with Chris Gaskill and he's asked me to start including the distribution of the Gas Fundamentals IT weekly status to you both so that you can keep abreast of the current tasks we are working on.  Hopefully, this will provide some insight into our current priorities and allow us to server the floor to our best of our ability.

Thanks,

Dave
