atest NFL Player News  Trent Green , QB KC - Bass/Hull Updated 10/18/01 Gre=
en should move the ball with ease against the Cardinals this week. But the =
Chiefs might depend on the run, so his numbers may be limited.  Ken Dilger =
, TE IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Dilger is not a major factor in the =
Indianapolis passing game anymore. Don't expect much from him against the u=
nderrated New England defense this week.  Marcus Pollard  , TE IND - Free A=
gent Updated 10/18/01 Pollard has emerged as Indianpolis' top option at tig=
ht end. He will once again be a key factor in the passing game against New =
England this week,  Edgerrin James , RB IND - JWillie Updated 10/18/01 Jame=
s was held to just 55 rushing yards in his first game against New England t=
his year. Expect much better numbers on James' home turf this week.  Reggie=
 Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Wayne is expected to start in=
 place of ! th! e injured Jerome Pathon for the second consecutive week. Wa=
yne has not done much yet, so don't put him in your Fantasy lineup.   Marvi=
n Harrison , WR IND - Russell Updated 10/18/01 Harrison suually performs we=
ll in divisional matchups, and has burned Patriots CB Ty Law in the past. E=
xpect him to produce good numbers against New England.  Peyton Manning , QB=
 IND - Neal/McKay Updated 10/18/01 Manning did not perform well the first t=
ime he faced New England. He was intercepted by the Patriots three times, b=
ut should perform better against them at home this week.  Randy Moss , WR M=
IN - Russell Updated 10/18/01  Moss did not participate in practice Wednesd=
ay due to his sore right ankle. He should be able to practice on Thursday a=
nd play Sunday against Green Bay, but hold off deciding on whether to use h=
im until it's clear whether he will be able to play.  Bill Schroeder , WR G=
B - Frank Updated 10/18/01 Schroeder missed practice Wednesday with an ankl=
e injury. He is receiving treatment and should play Sunday, but monitor his=
 progress before deciding whether to use him this week.  Terry Glenn , WR N=
E - Matty Updated 10/18/01 Glenn might have another good game this week. In=
dianapolis' secondary might have trouble handling Glenn, who immediately pr=
oved an early-season layoff didn't hurt him last week.  Antowain Smith , RB=
 NE - JWillie Updated 10/18/01 Smith rushed for 94 yards and two TDs the fi=
rst time he faced the Colts this year. Expect him to get in the end zone at=
 least once this week, in his second meeting with Indianapolis.  Wayne Chre=
bet , WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 10/18/01 Chrebet's numbers have been very di=
sappointing so far. He could have a good week if ! th! e Jets engage in a s=
hootout with the Rams. He is still a risky start, because New York will cen=
ter its gameplan around Curtis Martin.   Laveranues Coles , WR NYJ - JWilli=
e Updated 10/18/01 Coles has emerged as a go-to receiver for the Jets, but =
might be held down by the Rams. The St. Louis defenive backs should be able=
 to match his downfield speed.  Curtis Martin , RB NYJ - Tori Updated 10/18=
/01 Martin will be the focal point of the New York offense this week. The J=
ets will try to control the ball and the clock against the Rams.   S! te! p=
hen Davis , RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 10/18/01 Davis had his first decent =
game of the season on Monday against Dallas, but he's still a very risky Fa=
ntasy player due to Washington's horrible offense. Facing Carolina is an ad=
vantageous matchup, however, so starting Davis this week warrants considera=
tion.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Banks was very me=
diocre against Dallas on Monday night, completing 10-of-18 passes for only =
132 yards and one touchdown. At this point, Banks isn't even worth a roster=
 spot outside of deeper leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Free Agent =
Updated 10/18/01  Westbrook has been less than mediocre this season, but he=
 could have a decent outing against Carolina. He's had some success against=
 the Panthers in the past, but he's still only worth starting in deeper lea=
gues.   Vinny Testaverde , QB NYJ - Neal/McKay Updated 10/18/01 Testaverde =
might not be a good start this week. The St. Louis defense can be opportuni=
stic, and could very well make the Jets QB throw his first interception of =
the year.  Walter Rasby , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Rasby will l=
ikely get most of the work at tight end ! no! w that Stephen Alexander is o=
ut. However, he warrants no real Fantasy consideration at this point.   Rod=
 Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Gardner could have a decent=
 game against a questionable Carolina secondary on Monday. He's worth consi=
dering as a starter Fantasy-wise, but only in larger leagues.   Torry Holt =
, WR STL - Tori Updated 10/18/01 Holt has the potential to post big numbers=
 against a shaky N.Y. Jets secondary on Sunday. He's a big time Fantasy wid=
eout and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.   Isaac Bruce=
 , WR STL - Frank Updated 10/18/01 Bruce hasn't been very consistent thus f=
ar, but he's far too talented to ever consider benching. Look for him to tu=
rn things around against the questionable N.Y. Jets secondary.   Ernie Conw=
ell , TE STL - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Conwell has become a decent tigh=
t end from a Fantasy perspective this season. He's worth staring on a weekl=
y basis if you don't have a more reliable tight end on your roster.   Trung=
 Canidate , RB STL - Giggles Updated 10/18/01 Canidate will ! li! kely repl=
ace Marshall Faulk as St. Louis' featured back this weekend against the N.Y=
. Jets. He has a good knowledge of the Rams' offense and is easily worth st=
arting this week from a Fantasy perspective.   Kurt Warner , QB STL - Hunte=
r Updated 10/18/01 Considering the huge numbers he puts up on a consistent =
basis, Warner is a a must-start every week. He'll post another big game aga=
inst the New York Jets on Sunday, so be sure to put him your lineup.   Corr=
ell Buckhalter , RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Buckhalter isn't expe=
cted to start, but don't be surprised if he gets the majority of the carrie=
s on Monday night against the Giants. Coach Andy Reid will start Duce Stale=
y in the backfield, but Buckhalter will likely be the more productive o! f =
! the two backs.   Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - Russell Updated 10/18/01 McNab=
b is one of the top Fantasy players in the league, and is worth starting on=
 a weekly basis. He should beat the Giants for two scores and around 275 ya=
rds on Monday night, so be sure to get him into your lineup.   Todd Pinksto=
n , WR PHI - Hunter Updated 10/18/01 Pinkston is slowly becoming one of Don=
ovan McNabb's favorite targets this season. He's worth starting against the=
 Giants, whose secondary is a bit suspect at this point.   Tyrone Wheatley =
 , RB OAK - Giggles Updated 10/18/01 The Contra-Costa Times says Wheatley h=
as sustained a sprained medial collateral ligament in his right knee. Altho=
ugh some sources say Wheatley will miss two to four weeks, Jon Gruden says =
Wheatley is questionable for Oct. 28, and is unaware of any prognosis beyon=
d that.  Chad Lewis , TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Lewis will have =
a good shot at producing some solid Fantasy numbers on Monday against the N=
.Y. Giants. He's one of the league's top tight ends and should be in your s=
tarting lineup on a weekly basis.   More Updates  Transactions NFL Reports =
