layer News  Corey Bradford , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Bradford s=
tarted in place of the injured Bill Schroeder but was ineffective at Minnes=
ota, catching four passes for only 32 yards. Bradford has yet to prove hims=
elf as a Fantasy player.  Bubba Franks , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 10/21/0=
1 Franks caught only two passes for nine yards, but one of his receptions w=
as good for a two-yard TD. Franks has caught TD passes in five of six games=
 this year and has become a major scori! ng! threat even though he is not v=
ery effective outside of the red zone.  Derrick Alexander , WR KC - JWillie=
 Updated 10/21/01 Alexander finally had a big game, posting 99 yards receiv=
ing and a touchdown against Arizona. He's been unreliable for the most part=
, however, but his potential to post numbers this good makes it tough to be=
nch him.   Trent Green , QB KC - Bass/Hull Updated 10/21/01 Green threw for=
 352 yards and a score in Sunday's 24-16 loss to Arizona. Green has been in=
consistent this season, however, and no longer warrants a starting nod ever=
y week.   Doug Chapman  , RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Chapman rush=
ed for 90 yards on 22 carries against the Packers. His numbers were not gre=
at, but he was more effective than Michael Bennett has been so far. Chapman=
 may continue to see a good amount of carries if Bennett cannot stay health=
y or continues to struggle.  David Boston , WR ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 10/2=
1/01 Boston had a big game against Kansas City, posting seven receptions fo=
r 131 yards and a score. He's emerging as one of the best receivers in the =
league and is worth starting on a weekly basis.   ! Mi! chael Pittman , RB =
ARI - Matty Updated 10/21/01 Pittman had a great outing on Sunday against K=
ansas City, posting 137 yards of total offense and a touchdown. Pittman won=
't post numbers this good with any regularity, but he's still a valuable pl=
ayer to have on your roster.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - Free Agent Updated 10/=
21/01 Graham came up huge for San Diego on Sunday, catching seven passes fo=
r 107 yards and two scores against Denver. He's still not reliable enough t=
o start on a regular basis, but he's certainly worth a roster spot.   LaDai=
nian Tomlinson , RB SD - Hunter Updated 10/21/01 ! Tomlinson was held in ch=
eck for the first time this season by Denver on Sunday. The rookie tailback=
 rushed for only 58 yards on the day, but he's still one of the top Fantasy=
 players in the league.   Desmond Clark , TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/21=
/01 Clark had a big game on Sunday, catching six passes for 54 yards and a =
score against San Diego. He's been reliable as far as tight ends go from a =
Fantasy perspective, so continue to start him on a weekly basis.   Brian Gr=
iese , QB DEN - Matty Updated 10/21/01 Griese (shoulder) started Sunda! y'!=
 s game against San Diego, but he was ineffective. He posted 212 yards pass=
ing, a touchdown and two interceptions in Denver's 27-10 loss.   Peter Warr=
ick , WR CIN - Giggles Updated 10/21/01 Warrick caught eight passes for 84 =
yards against Chicago. But the potentially explosive wideout is hurting his=
 owners, because he does not find the end zone often.   Corey Dillon , RB C=
IN - Frank Updated 10/21/01 The Bears held Dillon to just 30 yards on 16 ca=
rries. Expect the veteran runner to bounce back from such a quiet performan=
ce very quickly.  ! David Terrell , WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Te=
rrell caught seven passes for 91 yards against Cincinnati. With Marcus Robi=
nson injured, Terrell should assume a more prominent role in the Chicago pa=
ssing game.  Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - Martin Updated 10/21/01 Thomas rushe=
d for 188 yards and a TD against Cincinnati, clearly establishing himself a=
s Chicago's top RB. Expect him to be the Bears' featured back for the rest =
of the year.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Matty Updated 10/21/01 Wycheck caugh=
t seven passes for 100 yards and a TD at Detroit. ! De! spite some quiet ou=
tings until this week, he remains a top-notch Fantasy TE, especially with t=
he Titans lacking in talent at wide receiver.   Charlie Batch , QB DET - Fr=
ee Agent Updated 10/21/01 Batch threw for 338 yards, three TDs and was inte=
rcepted once in a loss to Tennessee. Batch has stacked up good numbers in t=
wo consecutive weeks, but he remains a Fantasy risk because of his history =
of inconsistency.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Martin Updated 10/21/01 McNair t=
hrew for 216 yards, a TD and was intercepted twice at Detroit. He completed=
 only 15 of 35 attempts, and many of his throws were inaccurate, possibly i=
ndicating he still might be bothered by shoulder problems.!  Eddie George ,=
 RB TEN - Tori Updated 10/21/01 George was held to 51 yards on 26 carries b=
y Detroit. The lack of a reliable passing game in Tennessee has certainly h=
indered his production this year.   Shawn Jefferson , WR ATL - Free Agent U=
pdated 10/21/01 Jefferson caught three passes for 67 yards and a TD against=
 the Saints. The speedy wideout has a long history of inconsistency, so don=
't expect good numbers from him every week.  Alge Crumpler , TE ATL - Free =
Agent Updated 10/21/01 Crumpler caught five passes for 78 yards and a TD ag=
ainst New Orleans. Expect good totals from the big, quick tight end for the=
 remainder of the year.  Albert Connell , WR NO - Free Agent Updated 10/21/=
01 Connell caught only one pass for five yards against Atlanta. It is defin=
itely time to give up on the disappointing wideout.  Willie Jackson , WR NO=
 - Martin Updated 10/21/01 Jackson finished with only 46 receiving yards on=
 five catches against the Falcons. Mediocre numbers against the low-quality=
 Atlanta defense indicate Jackson is not capa! bl! e of providing owners wi=
th regularly good numbers.  Hines Ward , WR PIT - Tori Updated 10/21/01 War=
d was limited to 44 yards on three catches by Tampa Bay. Ward is still maki=
ng important receptions for the Steelers, but his Fantasy appeal is limited=
 because of Pittsburgh's inability to consistently score in the air.  Warri=
ck Dunn , RB TB - Martin Updated 10/21/01 Dunn played despite a foot injury=
 that had bothered him during the week, but he was limited to 31 yards on 1=
3 carries by a physical Pittsburgh defense.  Anthony Becht , TE NYJ - Free =
Agent Updated 10/21/01 Becht had a huge game against St. Louis, posting fiv=
e catches for 35 yards and two scores. He's been inconsistent this season, =
however, but his potential to post good numbers makes him worth starting at=
 a position lacking quality players.   Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Giggles U=
pdated 10/21/01 Johnson caught 10 passes for 159 yards against Pittsburgh. =
He has developed a good on-field relationship with QB Brad Johnson. The vet=
eran wideout should continue to post high-quality numbers on a regular basi=
s.  Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - Giggles Updated 10/21/01 Bettis rushed for 143=
 yards and a TD on 17 carries against Tampa Bay. He also threw a 32-yard TD=
 pass. His fine outing proves Bettis can compile good numbers against any d=
efense.  Trung Canidate , RB STL - Giggles Updated 10/21/01 Canidate had a =
huge game against the New York Jets, posting 232 yards of total offense and=
 two scores. His role as the Rams' featured back may be short-lived, howeve=
r, depending on the health of stud back Marshall Faulk.   Rod Gardner , WR =
WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Gardner had a huge game on Sunday, pos! t=
i! ng six catches for 208 yards and a score against Carolina. He seems to h=
ave overtaken Michael Westbrook as the No. 1 receiving target in Washington=
, and is worth a roster spot from a Fantasy perspective.   More Updates  Vi=
