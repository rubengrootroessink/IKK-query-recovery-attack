Stay  with a positive investment approach. =09
 Corporate  accounting and earnings quality issues, high P/Es and fear of a=
dditional  terrorism remain a drag on the market. Another restraint: Dynami=
c  leadership is absent and may not be seen until signs of improvement in  =
information technology spending breathe new life into that deeply  depresse=
d sector.  But barring  dramatic new financial irregularity disclosures, th=
e chances are good the  market will soon start moving forward again. The dr=
iving force, we  believe, will be an improving economy.  S&P  chief economi=
st David Wyss feels that if inventory rebuilding accelerates  sharply in th=
e period just ahead, it is possible the first quarter will  show strong GDP=
 growth and the second quarter a relapse into negative  territory. He point=
s out that the 1990-91 recession was the only one since  the 1950s that did=
 not have a positive quarter sandwiched between down  quarters. Wyss thinks=
 the more likely scenario, however, is a smoother  pace of inventory accumu=
lation and rising quarter-to-quarter GDP growth  through 2002. This forecas=
t implies upward-trending earnings this year and  next.  Investors,  burned=
 badly by the 2000-2001 bear market, are in a show-me state of mind.  Short=
 sellers and others who bet stocks will fall have become bolder  lately, an=
d institutions have been moving cautiously. All of this suggests  that a go=
od deal of fuel for an advance exists.   It wasn't a  good omen that the S&=
P 500 index slipped in January, losing 1.6%. As  mentioned a week ago, of t=
he 19 times in the postwar period that the "500"  has fallen in January, th=
e index then went on to score a gain for the full  year only seven times an=
d suffered a loss for the year 12 times. That was  against a backdrop of 2.=
4 up years for each down year for the 56 years  from 1946 through 2001.   O=
n the  other hand, a decline in the S&P 500 this year would be the third in=
 a  row, and that hasn't happened since  1941.=09
