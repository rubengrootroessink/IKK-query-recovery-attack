ell Davis  , RB DEN - JWillie Updated 10/24/01   Five weeks removed from ar=
throscopic knee surgery, the Denver Broncos running back was taken by surpr=
ise Wednesday when told of news reports saying he may have a stress fractur=
e in his leg and could be lost for the season.   "At this point in time, I'=
m on schedule to play this Sunday," Davis said.   Davis admitted that his r=
ight knee remains sore, but he has been well enough to play on the scout te=
am the past two weeks.   He remained on the scout team Wednesday. Davis was=
 listed as questionable on the weekly injury report.      Amani Toomer  , W=
R NYG - Tori Updated 10/24/01   According to published reports, Toomer migh=
t be benched in favor of WR Joe Jurevicius. Ike Hilliard will join Jurevici=
us if Toomer is demoted. Toomer caught only three passes Monday night again=
st the Eagles and did not have a reception for more than 10 yards. Head coa=
ch Jim Fassel demoted Toomer last season, in an effort to motivate him.    =
 Wayne Chrebet  , WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 10/24/01   Chrebet will miss Sun=
day's game at Carolina with a head injury. Coach Herman Edwards described C=
hrebet's ailment as "post-trauma migraines" and said he wanted to be extra =
cautious with the injury.   Edwards said Chrebet passed the various tests a=
nd scans he was given. Chrebet will be replaced by Kevin Swayne, a 26-year-=
old rookie who played in both the Arena League and the XFL during the past =
year. He has now been playing football for 40 straight weeks and has one ca=
tch for 19 yards in the NFL.      Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free Agent Upda=
ted 10/24/01   Sanders will not require surgery on his back. He will be re-=
evaluated after receiving an injection. His return date is unclear.    Bert=
 Emanuel  , WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Emanuel signed with the D=
etroit Lions on Wednesday. While the Lions are looking for a receiver to he=
lp fill the void created by a season-ending injury to Germane Crowell, Eman=
uel won't get the first crack at the job. Don't bother picking him up.    H=
ines Ward  , WR PIT - Tori Updated 10/24/01   Ward is day to day with an an=
kle injury. He is listed as probable for Monday's game against Tennessee.  =
  Germane Crowell  , WR DET - Giggles Updated 10/24/01   The Detroit Lions =
placed Crowell on injured reserve on Tuesday with a torn patella tendon in =
his left knee, which ends his season.    Santana Moss  , WR NYJ - Free Agen=
t Updated 10/24/01   The New York Daily News says there is still a noticeab=
le hitch in Moss' stride as he rceovers from knee surgery. The earliest the=
 Jets expect him to return is Dec. 2.    Brett Favre  , QB GB - Frank Updat=
ed 10/24/01   Favre skipped Tuesday's practice due to general soreness. Wit=
h Green Bay on the bye this week, expect him to be fully recovered in time =
for Week Eight.    Marvin Minnis  , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   E=
arly indications this week were Minnis would return to the starting lineup.=
 But the Kansas City Star notes Chris Thomas is still working with the firs=
t team in practice. There is no official word on which player will start on=
 Thursday against the Colts.    Larry Foster  , WR DET - Free Agent Updated=
 10/24/01   According to the Detroit Free Press , Foster is expected to sta=
rt in Germane Crowell's place Sunday against Cincinnati. Foster is an inexp=
erienced wideout not worthy of picking up in Fantasy leagues right now. Mon=
itor his progress over the next few weeks.    Marcus Robinson  , WR CHI - H=
unter Updated 10/24/01   The Bears placed Robinson on injured reserve on Tu=
esday with torn ligaments in his left knee, effectively ending his season. =
Drop him unless you play in a keeper league.    Neil Rackers  , K CIN - Fre=
e Agent Updated 10/24/01   According to the Cincinnati Enquirer , the Benga=
ls worked out three kickers, and did not sign one. Rackers' job is temporar=
ily safe, but he is a big Fantasy risk because of his erratic play.    Todd=
 Pinkston  , WR PHI - Hunter Updated 10/24/01   Pinkston has a strained wri=
st but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He will be evaluated on a day =
to day basis.     Ron Dixon  , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Dixon=
 missed Monday game because of a sprained ankle. He has made progress in hi=
s recovery and might play this week.    Joe Jurevicius  , WR NYG - Free Age=
nt Updated 10/24/01   Ike Hilliard regained his starting position Monday, r=
eturning Jurevicius to the role of a reserve. Jurevicius was productive as =
a starter in Hilliard's absence. However, he will be useless as the No. 3 r=
eceiver. There is a chance that he could return to starting lineup and repl=
ace Amani Toomer. Toomer has been inconsistent this season. Jurevicius play=
ed alongside Hilliard a few times in Sunday's game while Toomer stood on th=
e sidelines.     Reggie Swinton  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   S=
winton is suffering from a hamstring injury and is questionable for Sunday'=
s game against Arizona. "He [Swinton] worked with the trainers on Monday an=
d did some things, but he didn't do enough to say for sure he will be avail=
able," said head coach Dave Campo. Darrin Chiaverini and Raghib Ismail will=
 get more playing time in his absence.     Joey Galloway  , WR DAL - Giggle=
s Updated 10/24/01   Galloway is listed as questionable for this week's gam=
e against the Cardinals, but the Cowboys are optimistic about his chances o=
f playing. He is recovering from a sprained foot. "We're expecting some lim=
ited practice tomorrow, so I would say he is questionable from the standpoi=
nt that it will depend on how he improves the next two or three days," said=
 head coach Dave Campo.       Darrin Chiaverini  , WR DAL - Free Agent Upda=
ted 10/24/01   Chiaverini practiced Monday and is listed as probable for Su=
nday's game against the Cardinals. He is recovering from a left knee injury=
.     Raghib Ismail  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Ismail, recov=
ering from a sprained knee, practiced Monday without any problems. He is li=
sted as probable for this week's game.     Ricky Watters  , RB SEA - Free A=
gent Updated 10/23/01   According to the Tacoma News Tribune , Seahawks Hea=
d Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup =
as soon as he's healthy, which could be another month or longer. "We'll cro=
ss that bridge when we come to it," Holmgren said. "I would be surprised if=
 I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he=
 got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspe=
ct that when Ricky can play, he'll play again." If you have the roster room=
, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're=
 safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stretch.    Tre=
nt Dilfer  , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01   Dilfer was unable to pr=
actice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to =
Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point.    =
Matt Hasselbeck  , QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 10/23/01   Hasselbeck will be=
 the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, accord=
ing to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer . He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood=
 in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a ve=
ry favorable matchup for Hasselbeck from a Fantasy perspective, so don't us=
e him this week.    Wayne Chrebet  , WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 10/23/01   Th=
e Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Caroli=
na. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussio=
n he suffered Sunday against the Rams.    Dedric Ward  , WR MIA - Free Agen=
t Updated 10/23/01   Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He=
 is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy p=
layer at this point in the season.    Lamar Smith  , RB MIA - Neal/McKay Up=
dated 10/23/01   Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He i=
s still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him t=
his week.    Marvin Minnis  , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01   Chiefs =
Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chris =
Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you use =
either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imposi=
ng. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week.    Jerome =
Pathon  , WR IND - Tori Updated 10/23/01   Pathon might miss his third stra=
ight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don't use h=
im this week.    Terrence Wilkins  , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01  =
 Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken r=
ibs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week.    Terre=
ll Davis  , RB DEN - JWillie Updated 10/23/01   Davis is still targeting Su=
nday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic knee=
 surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they will activate him. =
He will work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by Wednesda=
y whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy lea=
gue unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running back and =
is 100 percent healthy.    More Updates    Player News Teams   [IMAGE]   Ne=
al/McKay Player News    Lamar Smith  , Active RB Updated 10/23/01  Smith di=
d not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected to play =
Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week.    Az-Zahir Hak=
im  , Active WR Updated 10/23/01  Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunda=
y's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be avail=
able for this weekend's game against New Orleans.    Tony Richardson  , Res=
erve RB Updated 10/22/01  Richardson (shoulder) did play against the Cardin=
als. He was used in goal-line packages and had one carry and one reception =
for 24 total yards. He will probably be used sparingly as a runner now that=
 Priest Holmes has clearly emerged as a featured back.    Tiki Barber  , Re=
serve RB Updated 10/22/01  Barber, who is probable with a hamstring injury,=
 is expected to play Monday night against Philadelphia. Still, he will not =
get many carries, as Ron Dayne is expected to get the bulk of the work. Bar=
ber might be on the verge of losing the starting job outright for the remai=
nder of the season.    Freddie Jones  , Reserve TE Updated 10/22/01  Jones =
sprained his ankle against Denver. His current status is day to day.    Vin=
ny Testaverde  , Reserve QB Updated 10/21/01  Testaverde was replaced by Ch=
ad Pennington in the second half of Sunday's game against St. Louis. The mo=
ve wasn't injury related, but simply Jets' coach Herm Edwards giving Pennin=
gton some playing time in a blowout game. Testaverde finished the afternoon=
 9-of-13 for 74 yards with a touchdown and an interception.    Mike Anderso=
n  , Active RB Updated 10/19/01  Anderson may find it difficult to reach 10=
0 yards against the Chargers. San Diego has a strong front seven, and the B=
roncos are having trouble with blocking on end runs.    Peyton Manning  , A=
ctive QB Updated 10/18/01  Manning did not perform well the first time he f=
aced New England. He was intercepted by the Patriots three times, but shoul=
d perform better against them at home this week.    Ron Dayne  , Reserve RB=
 Updated 10/18/01  Dayne has emerged as New York's main threat in the backf=
ield, and has been relatively productive in the role. Even with Tiki Barber=
 back in the mix, we expect Dayne to get the majority of the carries in the=
 game. He'll have a tough time running on the Eagles' defense, however, be =
he's still worth starting in deeper Fantasy leagues.    Keenan McCardell  ,=
 Active WR Updated 10/17/01  McCardell struggled in his first few games bac=
k from injury, but looked like his old self in the previous game. Look for =
McCardell to play well this week and catch a lot of passes.    Jerry Rice  =
, Active WR Updated 10/12/01  Rice should have another good outing. He shou=
ld draw inexperienced Indianapolis CB David Macklin in coverage, which mean=
s Rice will definitely be a TD threat again this week.    Shawn Bryson  , R=
eserve RB Updated 08/23/01  Bryson suffered a sprained ankle during practic=
e on Thursday. He was scheduled to have X-rays later in the day, but the te=
am has diagnosed it as a simple sprain at this point. Bryson, who will be a=
 game-time decision for this weekend's game at Cincinnati, is worth a later=
-round flier at best on Draft Day.    Broncos  , Active DT Updated 08/23/01=
  Defensive tackle Chester McGlockton, who suffered a slight ligament tear =
in his knee during Monday's preseason game, is expected to be ready for the=
 start of the regular season. Denver's defense has the talent to be a solid=
 unit from a Fantasy perspective, and will be one of the top ten defenses t=
aken on Draft Day.    Matt Stover  , Active K Updated 12/08/00  Stover need=
s just nine more field goals over the final three weeks of the season to br=
eak the NFL single-season record of 39 (Olindo Mare, 1999). Expect him to g=
et plenty of chances against San Diego on Sunday, and ensure that he's in y=
our active playoff lineup each week.   [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner=
