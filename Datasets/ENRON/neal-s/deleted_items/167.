I hate to have to say this, but there will be no more Mark Report in the year 2002.  I have decided not to stay on with the new UBS/Enron trading company.  It has been pleasure working with everyone and provided interesting and sometimes humorous commentary on the energy markets.  I hope to continue to stay in touch with some of you, but I will be moving on to a crude trading position at a major oil company here in Houston.  Good luck and keep hedging!
