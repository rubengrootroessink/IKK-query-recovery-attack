Initially, Chris Ordway was assigned to schedule Dominion and Iroquois pipe=
lines.  Now, after quickly mastering those two pipelines with their associa=
ted responsibilities, he is scheduling TETCO's market area and production a=
rea as part of a two person scheduling team.  Chris has quickly learned the=
 gas business and has adapted easily to change.  He's been able to prioriti=
ze his workload and meet all scheduling deadlines as well as our weekly and=
 monthly accounting deadlines. He has a strong desire to learn more about t=
he company and has made personal sacrifices to make sure his work gets done=
 correctly the first time.  I am very impressed at the speed at which he ma=
stered our trading system, Sitara and our nominations system, UNIFY.  He ha=
s also now familiarized himself with 3 pipeline EBB's  (NRG, Escript and Li=
nk) as well.  He streamlined various pathing processes on Dominion and corr=
ected  volume management issues on Dominion surrounding metered production.=
  From a commercial perspective, the traders are impressed with his sense o=
f urgency during trading, his adaptability to change directions in mid-stre=
am and his ability to explore better economic options while scheduling gas =
on either Dominion, Iroquois or TETCO. Chris is very quick and forthcoming =
with information during trading.   He doesn't try to solve all issues by hi=
mself.  In addition, he will actively solicit other opinions before he atte=
mpts to answer operational problems.=20

Chris has a very good sense of humor and is very easy to get along with.  T=
hose traits are pivotal in a high-stress trading and scheduling environment=
.  His communication skills allow him to extract pertinent information from=
 customers, competitors and operations personnel.  He's also very relentles=
s in his pursuit of information.  Chris typically doesn't settle for a "no"=
 answer or a response that doesn't make sense to him.  He is the consummate=
 team player.  He backs up for Dominion and Iroquois and has scheduled all =
of TETCO market/production area at one time.  Chris was willing to schedule=
 3 pipes at once in a backup role.  He worked well with his partner and has=
 built a good rapport with many of his industry contacts as well as his pip=
eline representatives.  In a very high stress environment, Chris has never =
lost his cool or been disrespectful. =20
  =09
Chris quickly learned all Enron internal systems as well as external pipeli=
ne systems and bulletin boards.   For someone so new to the game, he's got =
a good understanding of how gas moves on his pipes. He can determine the be=
st mix of transport/supplies/markets to optimize flow and cost-effectivenes=
s. He also familiarized himself with the VNG asset management deal and deve=
loped a method to capture storage and burn figures correctly.  Chris has th=
e complete trust of his peers, his traders and his management team when mak=
ing daily  decisions affecting his pipelines.  He shows a lot of interest i=
n learning and improving his understanding of the industry and the  operati=
ons of his pipelines.  Chris has a very bright future in this group and in =
this company.  He is already working at the same level of performance as hi=
s peers that are at the senior specialist level.  In addition, I was also p=
lanning on putting him up for promotion at year-end 2001 before the bankrup=
tcy occurred.  Due to all these reasons,  I recommend Christopher Ordway be=
 promoted to Senior Specialist as soon as possible.

Please feel free to call me with questions or concerns.
