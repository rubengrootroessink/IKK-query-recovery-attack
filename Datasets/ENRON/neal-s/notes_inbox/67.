In delaying implementation until COB Wednesday, I was trying to get past AG=
A=01,
s announcements.  I=01,ve been told that they may not be able to liquidate=

immediately after AGA=01,s are released.  (If market collapses, then buying=
=20
shorts would be easy, however if market rallies, the impression is that the=
y=20
may want to sell into the rally.)

The short version is that they like their positions.
