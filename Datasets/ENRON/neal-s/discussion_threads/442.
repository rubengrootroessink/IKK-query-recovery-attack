Tod, Scott,

I would like to set up a time when the three of us can meet to discuss my 
mid-year review.  I was told by HR that I was to initiate the dialogue and 
get the process rolling.  Let me know when you will be available.  I would 
like to meet sometime within the next two weeks.

Thanks,

Rob Brown
