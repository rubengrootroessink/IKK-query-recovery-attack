Dear  Amazon Customer,

As someone  who has purchased business and investing books in the past, you 
might like to know about the upcoming release of  Microsoft  Office XP. To 
celebrate, for a limited time we're offering free shipping on your order of 
any Office XP suite or upgrade.

Why make  the leap to Office XP? In addition to a better design and a more 
efficient work experience for home or business use, here are our top three 
reasons to upgrade:

1. New  document recovery feature that lets you save files at the moment an 
error message appears, so you don't lose valuable documents, spreadsheets, 
database entries, or presentations.
2. Task panes that provide you with easy access to all important tasks from 
one single, integrated view.
3. Context-sensitive smart tags that link to names, dates, addresses, phone 
numbers, and stock symbols--where and when you need them.

Visit our  Home  & Office Computing bookstore, too, for titles to complement 
your software purchase. You'll find Microsoft software books, handheld and 
Internet guides, troubleshooting resources, and lots more. 

Check out  our  Microsoft  Store today and discover even more reasons to 
upgrade to Office XP, including a buying guide to pinpoint the best version 
for you. Don't delay--pre-order your copy now to secure free shipping for 
Office XP. 

Sincerely,
