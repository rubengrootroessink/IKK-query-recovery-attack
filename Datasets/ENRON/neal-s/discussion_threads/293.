FYI.  Please check into this issue and let me know if we got the "rebate" or 
who it went to.

Ed -apparently CNG gave VNG an interstate pipeline rebate 
of about $300,000 but it's gotten hung up in the asset management stuff - VNG 
really needs to get its hands on that $ and make a filing at the VSCC to 
refund it - while the dollars are small, from a regulatory perspective, the 
VSCC is putting a bit of heat on VNG to make this refund happen - could you 
talk to your guys next week as I suspect the refund came to Enron since you 
pay the pipeline bills
