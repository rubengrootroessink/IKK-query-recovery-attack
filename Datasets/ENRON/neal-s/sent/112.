Subject: Opportunity

I was talking to Frank Vickers and he mentioned that you might want to talk 
about an opportunity on the trading side of the East group.  I just wanted to 
drop a note to let you know that I will be out of the office from Monday, 
Feb. 12 through Wednesday, Feb. 14.  However, I am eager to discuss any 
opportunities in trading.  Leave me a voice mail or just catch me at anytime 
on Thursday.
