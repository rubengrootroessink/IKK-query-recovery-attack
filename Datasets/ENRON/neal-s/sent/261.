Cindy, I think we may have a few things missing.     This is what Alagasco 
shows we have regarding contract numbers and expiration dates:

There are four  old CES/ Bring cotracts which have been assigned over to 
ENA.  They are:

Bring reference number   #10170, volume of 20471 expires 12/31/00  (has 
associated demand fees)     Alagasco ref # --  ENA No. 2,  Sitara #-250042
Bring Reference number  #10055, volume of 10000 expires 11/30/00 (has 
associated demand fees)      Alagasco ref # -- ENA No. 1,   Sitare #-250050

These are the only  two contract Alagasco wants to terminatein accordance 
with the expiration date.   In additon we have two other old Bring/CES 
contracts that have expiration dates in 2001 and 2002 that  they have no 
intention of  terminating, unless however ENA would allow them to which we 
would not since they have demand fees with escalators associated with them.   
They are:

Bring reference number #10219, volume of  5339, expires 10/31/01  (has 
associated demand fees)     Algasco ref # -- ENA No. 3, Sitare #250196
        Please note that in the system we have the termination date is 
correct but the volume is incorrect.  It reflects 10,000 and you can see that 
the date ranges have been split  each monthby  Joe Casas, whom  changes the 
volume in the scheduled section to 6,045 to account for fuel and what 
Alagasco is actually taking.  This needs to be corrected.     .Again, 
Alagasco has no intention of terminating this contract.

Bring reference number #10326,  volume of 10,000 during the winter only, 
months Nov - March , (has associated demand fees)  Algasco ref # -- ENA No.4
This deals expires October 31, 2002.  Sitara # --250186       This is the 
contract that allows Alagasco swing rights in which they have yet to 
exercise. 
AT one point Scott Neal had mentioned to try to work on taking this swing 
language out of the contract but I have not mentioned anything to them since 
they have yet to exercise  those swing rights and I did not want to bring it 
to there attention.    I do not know how much the demand fees are on this 
cotnract , but I would assume they are signficant.

Alagasco has sent  two termination letters to cancel the first two above 
contracts, only.  i.e.-- Bring ref #'s  10170 & 10055.    ENA does reflect 
these properly in the system so I believe we should be able to terminate 
these contracts.   The other two contracts have nothing to do with the two 
termination letters Alagasco sent us.   In additon, the two seasonal 
contracts that were done in Apirl & May 00  between Roger and myself, Sitara 
deals 242653 & 271301; Algasco  would like to tie these contracts  to the 
newly signed Enron Portfolio Master Firm Contract   wlhich I also agree with.

All deals look accurate in Sitara regarding term and volume except for Sitare 
# 250196, which I mentioned above.  I do not know the demand fees associated 
with the contracts so I do not know if they are in the system accurately or 
if they are being billed accurately.

Cindy, I think this information should be everything we need to clear up the 
confusion regarding Alagasco's pending terminaiton letter.    Please get with 
me once you have a minute.    Thank you.
