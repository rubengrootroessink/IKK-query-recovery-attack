I believe Vince Kaminski could possibly be of assistance in this matter.

Mr. Neal,

 I wrote you last week a request to spend some time talking to you
about Enron's Energy Risk Management for a report I am writing on energy
risk management applications.  I understand that you are a busy man, but I
would just like a half hour to talk.  If you would like a list of questions,
I would be happy to provide them.
 This conversation does not have to be on the record if you don't
want it to.  The main purpose for my enquiry is to understand how energy
risk applications are being used "on the ground".  I would like to be able
to write about Enron, but it is not required.
 I look forward to hearing from you.

Cheers,
