Due to credit exposure to Mieco, we have shut them down for trades, with the 
exception of physical gas purchases.  We need to notify the gas desk to 
purchase daily physical gas at index to help offset our exposures (ENA 
purchases only).  Please call your respective trade desks (gas, power, crude, 
coal, weather, etc).
