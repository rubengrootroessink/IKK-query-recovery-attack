Let's set up a meeting to discuss.  The Wellhead Group is responsible for 
everything up to the mainline/pool including scheduling, nominations, 
operational swing etc.  The East desk would have a deal with the Wellheasd 
Group for a firm daily quantity of gas at the mainline or pool.

George, Could you please answer a few preliminary operational questions 
before we proceed..
Has Scott Neal approved this for our desk (assuming risk and swings)?  Is our 
logistics group nominating, scheduling, confirming and balancing this 
wellhead?   Are we buying from you or are we buying from Cabot??? Who's 
responsible for deal entry and management in Sitara? Who's responsible for 
notifying us of changes?  Do we need to acquire transport for this or is it 
moved IT (Transco charges for pool receipts)
Operationally we need as much lead time to submit timely noms daily and at 
the first of every month.  We would like changes/swings to be communicated 
via e-mail, fax if necessary and followed by phone call to ascertain 
receipt.... 
Once we have some of these questions answered we can talk details....
Thanks

I am trying to send out this draft to Cabot today and really need your input 
on these scheduling issues and the new production issues ASAP. I have some 
ideas on protecting us for new wells and want to see what you think. Thanks.

Shawna, as we discussed, please adjust the pricing provision of the two (2) 
Cabot Oil & Gas Marketing Corporation gas purchase agreements to provide for 
the following:  on a daily basis, we will pay index minus $0.005 for the 
first 80% of the gas produced that day and gas daily minus $0.005 for the 
remaining 20% of the gas produced that day.  I believe this pricing mechanism 
roughly approximates the Kerr McGee pricing provision you recently prepared 
for Brian Riley at meter 6884.

Shawna,

Attached are three (3) Contract Preparation Requests for two (2) Committed 
Reserves Agreements (Purchase Directly from Producer) along with a 
Confidentiality Agreement for Cabot Oil & Gas Marketing Corporation 
production in Terrebonne Parish, LA, currently flowing on Transco (Turtle 
Bayou) and Tennessee (Kent Bayou).  As we discussed yesterday, the Committed 
Reserves Contracts requested herein should be virtually identical to the 
contract recently executed by Panaco, Inc. for the Sturlease well.  The 
Confidentiality Agreement will cover both Fields.

How are we planning to handle daily volume swings on the 30% priced at Gas 
Daily and which group will hold this risk?  
Which group will handle nominations/scheduling/balancing on the gathering 
system?

Eric & John

Enron NA is currently purchasing wellhead gas from the referenced well on 
Transco on a month-to-month basis pursuant to Sitara #415772.  We believe 
Enron Upstream may have an opportunity to firm up this purchase for at least 
a year and perhaps 2 years.  It appears ENA is currently paying a $0.0787 
transport rate along with 4.5% fuel to Transco; the well is producing between 
18,000 and 19,000 Mmbtu/d.

Could you please get us a quote to purchase this wellhead gas on a firm basis 
based on the following:

1 year term
or
2 year term, commencing 11/1/2000

firm purchase and firm transport for 70% of the wellhead volume, starting at 
70% of 18,000 per day and declining as will be defined by our Reserve 
Department

gas daily purchase and interruptible transport for the remaining 30% of the 
wellhead volume

Enron Upstream will keep the desk financially whole should volumes for the 
70% firm component fail to show up on any given day of the 1 year or 2 year 
term

Eric, you have advised you will not be available at 3:30 today; John, would 
you please join us in 3271 today at 3:30 to talk about the mechanics of 
pricing and ticketing the deal described above.  Thanks.

George x3-6992
