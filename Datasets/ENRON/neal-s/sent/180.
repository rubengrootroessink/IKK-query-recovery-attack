Rolo and I worked together in BA.  Rolo did a great job for us, focusing 
mostly on gas but he did do some work on power as well.  
He is very bright and has a great work ethic.  He has gained a fair amount of 
commercial experience (including "trading" natural gas) in Argentina. I would 
recommend him highly.
