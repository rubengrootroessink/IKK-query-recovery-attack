I think his interest is a marketing/oringination/business development role.

Scott,
I know James McCord personally.  He used to work for Coastal, as part of the 
fuels marketing group.  I have worked with him in the past.  Do you know what 
he is interested in?  His background at Coastal was, as I mentioned, fuels.  
Thanks! Mariella
ps: sorry for the horribly late reply/reaction.
