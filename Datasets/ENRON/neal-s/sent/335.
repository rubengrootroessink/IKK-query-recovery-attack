It was good to meet you last Thursday.  It is always fun to harass the NY
locals, even if it has to be done through a tele-conference camera.

Here is something to file away for future use, save the head-hunter fees and
give me a call direct the next time you are looking for a seasoned Nymex
futures/options hand.

Thanks,
Ted  Jones   281-293-2343
