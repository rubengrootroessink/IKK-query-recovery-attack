Doug Leach called me about this.  Could one of your guys call this guy and 
see if there is anything we can do to help him.  He is a friend of Doug's and 
will give us the business if we are competitive.  Supposedly he has a very 
favorable fixed price offter from a competitor, so I think it is a fishing 
expedition.

Thanks,

Tom

Tom,

I will be out of town until November 8 so if Enron is interested in quoting 
LSU a ten year physical natural gas price, then please contact Mr. Joe Kelley 
via email at jkelley@lsu.edu or via telephone at (504) 388-5603. 

Thanks,
Doug
