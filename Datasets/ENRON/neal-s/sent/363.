Subject: Tree Stumps Removal


Scott: Barry called me this morning and asked if we would want to get the
stumps ground of the trees removed in the yard. He said the tree man had a
relative that would do it for a $70 set up fee plus $5 per stump (approx 14
stumps). The tree man will deduct this off of what he owes us for the trees.
I told Barry to go ahead as it needs to be done and the price is right.
