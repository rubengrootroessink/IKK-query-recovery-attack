David,

I think maybe clarifying "then go to the transaction search" with something 
like " then click on the Transaction History tab at the top of the screen" 
might be 
helpful.

Jay,

Here is the current communication error message:




Can you please replace the above paragraph as follows:

"YOUR TRANSACTION MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL due to a communication 
failure."
"To confirm whether or not your transaction was successful, please try to 
login again and use the "Transaction History" function to see a list of all 
your completed transactions.

If you have any questions or are not certain of the status of a transaction, 
please contact us immediately on:"

Thanks,

Dave
