We would love to go.  I need to call and check with Carol to confirm.  I will 
call or email after I talk with her.

Subject: Saturday Invitation

Scott:  I left you a voice mail last night.  We have some tickets for the 
Gypsy Kings concert in the Woodlands Saturday night and Mary and I wanted to 
see if you and Carol wanted to join us.  I've been working till 2:00 in the 
morning the last few nights so have waited way too late to invite you.  Sorry 
for that.  But try to let me know ASAP if you can go.

Scott
