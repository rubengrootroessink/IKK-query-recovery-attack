October and prior months.  The overall average daily Non-EOL deal count has 
remained very steady from about 465 to 544 trades a day since November 1999.

*  US Power has come back further and increased its average daily EOL Deal 
Count by about 70% since December, from 181 to 306 deals per day.  In 
addition, the average daily Non-EOL Deal Count has now decreased by about 2% 
since December, from 373 to 365 deals per day.  The average daily EOL volumes 
have remained steady.

*  Northeast Power has dramatically increased its average daily EOL Deal 
Count by about 115% since December, from 59 to 126 deals per day.  In 
addition, the average daily Non-EOL Deal Count has now decreased by about 23% 
since December, from 113 to 87 deals per day.  The average daily EOL volumes 
have remained steady.

*  UK Gas and Continental Gas have increased their overall average daily EOL 
deal count by over 50% since December.  The average daily EOL volumes have 
increased similarly as well.

*  Austrian Power has increased its overall average daily EOL deal count by 
over 5 times since December.  They had been averaging only about one to two 
trades a day since inception in April 2000.  In January 2001, their average
