Dear Wildca t Players and  Parents:

In planning for this Tuesday's game, it could  be damp and cold.
Therefore, in order to maximize the comfort of our players, I would
suggest:

1)  have a tight fitting leather or imitation leather glove (Jacob will be
using
    his baseball gloves).  The key is " tight and thin".

2) Extra (Thin) layer of clothing under uniform (Thermals work well). The
    Key is "tight and  thin layer".

3) Large oversize (cheap)  pancho - cut open in the front. The key is
"oversized"
   and easy on/off.

See you at practice tonight!
Go Wildcats!

Coach Butcher
