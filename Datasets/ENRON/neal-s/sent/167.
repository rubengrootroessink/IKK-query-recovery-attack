Scott 

We love these kind of leads.  I will ask Sophie Kingsley who leads our A&A 
program to work on getting her
over here.  When it calms down over there I would love to catch up with you 
and see how the wild and wooly
nat gas markets are going.  I sure wish I was doing the West Desk for this 
Winter.

John

John,

Please find attached the resume of Angie Zeman, who is an analyst working a 
rotation in East Gas Logistics.  She is an outstanding perfromer and is 
interested in pursuing opportunities  in London.  Who is the best person in 
your organization to communicate her interest and my recommendation?

Thanks.
 
Scott
