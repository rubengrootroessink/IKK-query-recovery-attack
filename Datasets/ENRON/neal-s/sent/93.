Rockhounds & parents,
?
Hey everyone, I've finally got the pre-season game  schedule.? I've attached 
the latest overall schedule (rev 2,?and in a  earlier version of Excell so 
hopefully it can be easily opened).? Please  let me know if this is a format 
problem for anyone, I can fax it and/or mail it  if you'll let me know.
?
Basically the changes are that our games next week are  Tuesday (6:00 pm 
gametime?at Memorial Middle School field #3) and  Thursday (8:00 pm gametime 
at Spring Forest Field #2, our  regular practice field)? Also, I've upped the 
practice start time  next Saturday to 8:30 am going?till 10:30 (since our  
game?Tuesday the 6th will?wipe out our practice)?and corrected  the error on 
the time for the March 10th practice (thanks Trisha).? If  these games are 
rained out they will not be made up.
?
By the way, I've got a practice scheduled for the March 10th  but I'm sure 
some will be out since that's the first part of SBISD spring  break.? Please 
let me know how many will be able to attend.
?
I don't think this really applies to anyone on our team, by  just fyi:? the 
league has requested that parents not drop their kids off in  front of the 
fields (by driving down the dirt trail).? There is too much  kid traffic and 
they're worried about accidents.? Just keep to the parking  lot.
?
See everyone this Tuesday at 7:30.
?
thanks,
Jeff
