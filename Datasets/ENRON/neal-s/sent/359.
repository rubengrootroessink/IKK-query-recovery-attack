James is a neighbor and  good friend of mine.  He and his wife went to school 
with my wife.  Although I have never worked with James, my view is he is a 
marketer/originator/business developer.

Scott:

Thanks fo the lead.  Just a couple of quick questions: (1) How well do you 
know James?  (2)  Depending upon your answer to #1, what type of role would 
you see him playing in an ENA group?

Hope all is well.


Best regards - Max
