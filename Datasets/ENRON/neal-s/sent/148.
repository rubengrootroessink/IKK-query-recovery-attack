Kimberly,

Please see if Scott will be able to meet with some Howard finance professor's 
on January 25, 2001.  The latest appointment in the evening will work if it 
is at all possible for Scott to meet during that time.  If I can even get 30 
minutes I would be greatly indebted to you and Scott forever.  If not, is 
there anyone else on the trading floor able to give me some time.

Please advise as soon as possible?

Thanks, Geynille
