I have attached a list of Enron's Top Trading customers who are not doing 
business on EOL.  Customers designated as Execute are signed up on EOL and 
can begin transacting if they have suitable credit.  Please circulate this 
list to your team to push some of these counterparties to begin using 
EnronOnline.  If you have any questions, feel free to contact either myself 
or Bryan Hull.  Thanks for your help.
