I really don't have a clue.  However,it seems that most of the costs are 
generally fixed - people, systems, etc.

Scott,

I'm working with some guys that are trying to build out some software to
improve back office efficiencies...do you have any good reference points for
back office costs in power trading on a $/Mwhr basis?

I figure it is  bit busy at the moment and will call you this afternoon to
follow up...

Thanks, Lynn Bourdon
