I enjoyed visiting with you as well.  I was very impressed with the students 
that I interviewed.  You guys are certainly doing a great job educating.  
 I had the pleasure of visiting with Milagros and was very impressed with her 
and I agree with your comments. 

Some of the students were interested in additional reading that I thought 
might be helpful to them.  2 books that I think are very good  are 1) Option 
Volatility and Pricing by Sheldon Natenberg.  This is textbook type reading 
that is the best book on options that I know.  2) Reminisences of A Stock 
Operator by  Edwin Lefevre.  This is the best book on trading that I have 
read (I am actually currently reading it for the fifith of sixth time).  It 
is an easy read and is the real lfe story of a trader in the early 1900's.  A 
must read for anyone who has interest in markets and trading.

Sincerely,

Scott Neal

Hi Geynille and Scott,

I wanted to thank you for lunch today and tell you how much I enjoyed
meeting you.  Input from professionals such as yourself helps us to make
our classes more relevant and offer better advice to our students.  We
appreciate that you are willing to take the time to make this valuable
contribution.

One of my former students, Milagros Daetz, dropped by to see met later in
the day to tell me about her Enron interviews.  Milagros was very excited
about Enron and impressed with all of the people she had met.  I want to
offer an unsolicited recommendation on her behalf.  Milagros is one of the
most impressive students I have ever taught.  While her GPA (3.9) is
sufficient to certify her academic record, I wanted to comment on her
intangible qualities.  Milagros is mentally tough, hard working,
determined, and ambitious.  Just as important, she is a genuinely nice
person.  She deals with people very well and possesses what I would
describe as quiet leadership characteristics.  In other words,  she leads
by example and by reason.  I also find her to be mature beyond her age and
willing to assume responsibility for her own choices.  In short, I think
Milagros would be an asset to any organization.

Again,  it was good meeting you.  Please fell free to contact me if I can
help you in any way.

Regards,
