Rockhounds & Parents,
?
Looks like we'll be rained out this afternoon for batting cage  practice.? 
For tomorrow's practice we'll probably be unable to play on the  field due to 
standing water, or possibly continued rain, but, we will go ahead  and have a 
"skull" session at my house at 9:00am.? My address is 13611  Pinerock, just 
off of Yorkchester (between Wilchester and Kirkwood), 4 blocks  north of 
Memorial.
?
The practice tomorrow will be 1 hour, from 9 till 10:00.?  See everyone then.
?
Jeff
