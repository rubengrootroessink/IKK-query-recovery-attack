***REMINDER***

We have yet to receive your feedback.  Your input is

Thank you for your participation.

___________________________________________
Executive Impact & Influence Program
* IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED - Do Not Delete *

As part of the Executive Impact and Influence Program,
each participant is asked to gather input on the
participant's own management styles and practices as
experienced by their immediate manager, each direct
report, and up to eight peers/colleagues.

You have been requested to provide feedback for a
participant attending the next program.  Your input
(i.e., a Self assessment, Manager assessment, Direct
Report assessment, or Peer/Colleague assessment) will
be combined with the input of others and used by the
program participant to develop an action plan to
improve his/her management styles and practices.

It is important that you complete this assessment
NO LATER THAN CLOSE OF BUSINESS Thursday, September 14.

Since the feedback is such an important part of the
program, the participant will be asked to cancel
his/her attendance if not enough feedback is received.
Therefore, your feedback is critical.

To complete your assessment, please open your internet
browser and go to the following web site:

to rate is:
