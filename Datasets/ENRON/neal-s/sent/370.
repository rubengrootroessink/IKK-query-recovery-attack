Hey Phil, let's set up a meeting for later this week to walk thru this deal 
structure in detail with Scott Neal. If we think there is real value here to 
ENA, I'd like to take this to execution asap. However, if we don't think we 
can/want to make these commitments, let's cut the cord and move on. The 
critical path item as I see it is what we want to do at Elba Island as far as 
offtake obligation. There is certainly substantial value here compared to the 
current gas index price embedded in the Elba tolling agreement. 

Jeff, depending on your schedule, you may want to try and attend.  Thanks.
