Mark,  
Attached is a revised memo.  The memo previously forwarded defined Bridgeline 
exclusive customers as those connected to interstate pipelines.  The correct 
definition of Bridgeline exclusive customers are those connected exclusively 
to intrastate pipelines.  I'm sorry for any confusion.  Please destroy any 
copies of the previous memo.  Thanks.  Shonnie

		 Subject: Bridgeline List of Industrial Customer off limits to ENA

Shonnie,
 Scott Neal gave me your name as someone who might be able to provide me with 
the list of customers that are "off-limits" to ENA to provide physical gas to 
via the Bridgeline agreement.  If you could email me that list, it would be 
helpful.  Thanks
