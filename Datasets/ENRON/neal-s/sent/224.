Subject: Comments on August 15 Order 637 Filings

Attached are initial comments of ENA which were filed Thursday in the Order 
637 Compliance Filings of the indicated pipelines.  For all other pipelines, 
we filed plain interventions.


Objected to "use it or lose it" provision on alternate primary points on 
segmented capacity.


Protested no tolerance on imbalance based on highest or lowest daily price in 
the month.


Protested additional charge to create a primary point on segmented capacity, 
forced daily balancing service, and change from unauthorized overrun penalty 
(which is credited) to a service which is not.  Requested technical 
conference.


Same as Tennessee
