Subject: Tennessee Purchase of Physical Gas

Scott, this is all I could find about Tennessee's right to buy system gas.  
There was nothing specific to fuel, and of course nothing at all about 
financial transactions.  I don't read it to prohibit them from buying on a 
forward basis, but they would probably be at risk if prices moved against 
them too much.

Basically, Tennessee can buy or sell gas as required to balance and to 
maintain system integrity.  And they can buy or sell it either (1) on a first 
come/first served basis at posted prices, (2) through an auction or gas 
trading system, or (3) through direct negotiations.  They no longer have a 
fuel tracker.  Since they are supposed to be retaining fuel from their 
transportation customers, they shouldn't be buying fuel, per se.  

The Order 497 regulations deal only with information about transportation, so 
Tennessee would not be required, absent a tariff provision, to post or report 
its purchases from affiliates at the time it does them.  They do, however, 
have to file a report of their cashout transactions, including any purchases 
they make for balancing.  If one suspected they had overpaid their affiliate 
for such gas purchases and it could be substantiated in the filing, the issue 
could be raised in the cashout report proceeding at FERC.  Purchases made for 
system integrity purposes, if not tied to cashout, would have to be addressed 
in the next rate case.

                  (ii)  Operational Transactions:  Operational Transactions

operational integrity.
