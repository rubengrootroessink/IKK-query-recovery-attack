Everything is good here. Gary has been with Enron for quite a while.  Most 
recently, he managed interest rate and foreign exchange/currency risk.  You 
should give him a call or email.  

Besitos a las chicas de Filo.

Suerte,

Scott

Hey Scott,
How is the East Desk doing?I can imagine that things are rolling over there. 
Do you know this new guy assigned to trading Ag. commodities Gary Hickerson? 
I would really like to get in touch with him. What do you think.

Trying to make things roll down here.

Saludos,

Pablo
