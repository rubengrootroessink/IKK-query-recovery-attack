Todd,

I am available for fishing with you on Sept.8. On the 8 Sept. when you
arrive, I will take you to fish and we can discuss what type of deep fishing
you want. It is no problem getting a guide if I can not take you deep
fishing. This is a slow season and a lot of tour guides are available. You
do not need to bring any equipment. We have any kind you need. Are you
staying at Holiday Hotel ? I will speak to you on the day of your arrival.
Hope to see you soon.

Abel Guerrero Esq.
