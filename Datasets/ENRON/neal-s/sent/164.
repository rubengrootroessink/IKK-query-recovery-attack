Subject: Gas Daily Electronic Index


Please note that as of Wednesday, December 13, Gas Daily will begin 
publishing an Electronic Trading Index for the gas market. We will be 
contributing to this index, which will show prices similar to those currently 
available in the EnronOnline Content section under "EnronOnline Price 
Reports".

If you or others in your organization get questions from customers or media, 
please refer to the following points regarding the message we're trying to 
promote:
An increasing number of transactions done online are proving the 
"staying-power" of the platforms and are legitimizing transaction data from 
them.
Ideally, these numbers should be audited before being given to the 
publications so as to minimize reporting errors.  EnronOnline's numbers are 
audited by Arthur Andersen on a periodic basis.
An increased participation from the other platforms will allow these indices 
gain more credibility/appeal and encourage customers to settle on them.

Please forward this email to appropriate people in your dept.

If you have any questions on the above, please contact Rahil Jafry on 33206.

Thanks,

Dave
