I have a seat for Frank and I am working on Gil and the rest of those guys.  
Ina is out until Thursday, but I will be giving her a call at home this 
morning to see what can be done.  I will coordinate the move as  soon as I 
have a space.  Meanwhile, I am checking with the guys periodically to meet 
their needs while they are on the 31st floor.  Call me if you have any 
further questions x35193.

Regards,

Kimberly
