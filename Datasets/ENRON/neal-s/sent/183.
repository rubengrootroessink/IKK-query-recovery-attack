Dear Wildcats:

What a great game you guys had against the Titans!  The team party at
Speedy's was great - a special thanks to Mrs. Burge and Mrs. Gwydir for
organizing the event.

For this week, I spoke to the Commissioner this morning and he stated our
Tully Bowl Game is "95%  sure for Sunday, November 19, 2:00pm".  If this
is so,
I would like everyone to report at 1:00pm.

Here is the balance of the schedule for the week:

Wednesday, Nov. 15 - Practice 4:30-6:00pm
Thursday, Nov. 16 - Backfield only - no pads - 5:15-6:00
Saturday, Nov. 18 - Practice 9:00-11:00am

Special note: Do not wear your football cleats to the Tully Bowl - They
don't
work on the Astro Turf - WEAR TENNIS SHOES ON SUNDAY!

Lets work hard this week  and Beat The Mustangs!
Go Wildcats!

Coach Butcher
