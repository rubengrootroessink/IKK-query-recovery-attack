Please review the attached EnronOnline press releases which are scheduled for 
release at 10:00 AM CDT tomorrow, July 12, 2000.  The purpose of the separate 
releases (the counterparties will make their own releases in addition) is to 
communicate the message that our goal is to continue to increase liquidity.  
One way to do that is give the greatest possible number of  buyers and 
sellers the opportunity to see our prices.

Please send any comments to me by 9:00 AM CDT tomorrow, July 12, 2000.
