Sorry it took so long but the spring break weekends missed me up. Laser
Quest is located at 13711 Westheimer between Eldridge
and Highway 6
Hours are:
Tuesday thru
Thursday           6 to 10
Friday               4 to 12
Saturday          12 to 12
Sunday            12 to 8

We can reserve a twenty minute slot with ten or more for $6.50 per person or
$7.50 if less then ten.

I suggest we meet their Sunday April 1 at 5 o'clock then get a bite to eat
afterwards. Please confirm if you plan to be there or not so I can make
reservations.
      Joe Hays
