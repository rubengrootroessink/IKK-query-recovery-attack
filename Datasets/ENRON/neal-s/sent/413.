yes, I have seen the fertilizer companies back off their buying due to gas 
prices.    Terra Resources reduced their purchasing signficantly for the 
month of June, supposedly they bought no spot gas at all only term 
commitments.   There total load is around 200,000 but I do not know the mix 
up between spot and term.   Also CF Industries and Farmland (which are small 
gas buyers) reduced their volumes as well.    PCS initially reduced their 
voumes for thier Geismer facility but when gas prices dipped to upper 3.90s 
and low 4.00's they came in and bought the supples they had curtailed and are 
at max volumes.


Thanks.
