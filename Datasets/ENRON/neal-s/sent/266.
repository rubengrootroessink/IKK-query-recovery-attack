Can send you me a copy of the 2000 plan for the East Desk?

Subject: 2001 Margin Plan



As you are already aware, Suzanne Nichole has moved on and I am the new team 
reporting accountant for Gas Trading.  I am in the process of working on your 
plans for 2001.  Dealiney and Lavarato communicated that 2001 margin plans 
are to be initiated by each team and the minimum increase expected is 20% 
over each of your 2000 plans.  Please send me your margin expectations so 
that I can update the templates and forward you revised copies which will 
include your direct expense plan dollars.

Given that the deadline for turning this information in to the Office of the 
Chair is approaching soon, please send me your estimates as soon as you can.

Thanks, Paula.
