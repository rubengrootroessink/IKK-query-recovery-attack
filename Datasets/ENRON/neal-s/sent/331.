Please plan to attend an Origination Strategy meeting on Thursday 8/17 at  
2:30pm.  We will be meeting with Gil Muhl, Janet Dietrich
and others to discuss customer coverage, deal flow, strategic deals/customers 
etc.  I think the meeting is going to held offsite  at either 
the Doubletree or Hyatt.  

Details to follow.  Let me know if you have any questions.
