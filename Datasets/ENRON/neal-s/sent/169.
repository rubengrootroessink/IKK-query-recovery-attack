Subject: EOL Reports & Analysis

I am working with the EOL system development group on improving the reporting 
capabilities of EOL so that Internal EOL traders can personalised and save 
report formats.  Currently the system only saves the last report format.  If 
you have any ideas, thoughts or requests please let me know.
I have attached a file with examples of reports that can be generated.  The 
goal would be to give you the ability to view the information when you need 
it and in the required format.
