Enterprise Systems Without Disrupting Its
Business

PALO ALTO, Calif., July 24 /PRNewswire/ -- Advancing its leadership in the 
application integration space, TIBCO Software Inc. (Nasdaq: TIBX -

keep up with our business growth, and just as important, that our vital 
business processes not be disrupted as we continue to implement new 
solutions.''

information infrastructure that connects every system and process in the 
enterprise,''
said Fred Meyer, vice president of product management for TIBCO Software. 
``TIBCO ActiveEnterprise is helping leading companies like Network
Appliance further leverage their front-end and back-end IT systems and bring 
those systems closer to customers and partners over the Web.''
