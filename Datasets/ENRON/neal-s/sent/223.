How are we planning to handle daily volume swings on the 30% priced at Gas 
Daily and which group will hold this risk?  
Which group will handle nominations/scheduling/balancing on the gathering 
system?

Eric & John

Enron NA is currently purchasing wellhead gas from the referenced well on 
Transco on a month-to-month basis pursuant to Sitara #415772.  We believe 
Enron Upstream may have an opportunity to firm up this purchase for at least 
a year and perhaps 2 years.  It appears ENA is currently paying a $0.0787 
transport rate along with 4.5% fuel to Transco; the well is producing between 
18,000 and 19,000 Mmbtu/d.

Could you please get us a quote to purchase this wellhead gas on a firm basis 
based on the following:

1 year term
or
2 year term, commencing 11/1/2000

firm purchase and firm transport for 70% of the wellhead volume, starting at 
70% of 18,000 per day and declining as will be defined by our Reserve 
Department

gas daily purchase and interruptible transport for the remaining 30% of the 
wellhead volume

Enron Upstream will keep the desk financially whole should volumes for the 
70% firm component fail to show up on any given day of the 1 year or 2 year 
term

Eric, you have advised you will not be available at 3:30 today; John, would 
you please join us in 3271 today at 3:30 to talk about the mechanics of 
pricing and ticketing the deal described above.  Thanks.

George x3-6992
