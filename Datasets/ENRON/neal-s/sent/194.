Scott:

I hope that all is well.  India is still going strong with additional 
involvement in commodity trading (electricity, fuels...etc.)  

Please advice of the best time to phone you this week to seek your help in 
reference to compiling letters of recommendation for the Green Card 
application.  The application, supported by Enron, will be under the "Alien 
of Extraordinary Ability" Category.   I am sure that your recommendation will 
go a very long way and I am hopeful that you will agree to help.  

I am enclosing the email I received from the lawyer and the sample letter 
suggested. I am trying to highlight--where the lawyer indicated--the attempts 
to safeguard and promote US investment in Argentina,  the rapport I had with 
the various echelons of authority in that country, and shed light on 
character and ability.  Please feel free to add/delete as you see fit and 
advice of any comments and/or suggestions.    

Needless to say, and regardless of outcome, I really appreciate your help and 
advice.  


Best regards
