Subject: Kate's Baby Shower****

I forgot to include the date..... August 18 at 3:00 in EB32C2.

The East Desk will be hosting a baby shower for Kate and Mike Fraser, 
celebrating their anticipated arrival of twins(a boy and a girl)!!!!!!  I 
will be collecting $20 or whatever you would like to give for a gift.  As 
always this is not mandatory.  You can bring your donation to my desk 
anytime. 

Thanks

Kimberly
