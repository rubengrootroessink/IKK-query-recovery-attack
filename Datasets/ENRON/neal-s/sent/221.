let's talk this afternoon.  I think we need to think about a couple of these 
folks.  Also, Dave needs our 2000 goals and objectives, top target customers, 
as well ideas for coverage metrics.  I have a meeting from 3pm to 4pm but am 
available any other time.

Scott, hope all is well.  I will get to the point.  What are your suggestions 
on the individuals that we have been assigned ?  I need to rely on you for 
any input that might suggest that we not take someone on.  I understand that 
Dave wants any personel changes as soon as possible.  What do you think ?  We 
do not want to begin with HR problems if we can avoid it upfront.

Please e-mail or call at 503-464-3940.

Frank
