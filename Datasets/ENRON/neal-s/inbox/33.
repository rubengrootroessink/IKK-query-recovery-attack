Scott, I would like to sue Kim in an expanded role within the group. She will still be responsible for all of her current activities but will also work with the group on Pipeline postings and expansions, RFP and information responses, Development of Presentations, etc.  I think that in the long run she can develop and be moved into other positions.  Especially after she earns her degree.  I have spoken with HR.  We will monitor to assure that she does not let any of her curent responsibilities slide.  Let me know if you have and concerns.


Also, I have completed the Performance plan for John Hodge ( Required due to his ranking in 2000).  I will leave a copy on your desk for review and execution.  Let me know if you have any questions.
