I need ten minutes of your time to review the discussion database concept that was requested by Frank Vickers back in Febuary.  The purpose of the meeting is to discuss the merits of the project, make a decision on whether we move forward and if we do move forward whose budget this would impact..  Find attached a description of the project with a cost estimate ($10,560).
I have scheduled EB3259 at 5:00PM 4/24/01, if you cannot make it please let me know.
Thanks,
Sean
