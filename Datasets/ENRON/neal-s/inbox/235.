I want to pass on some work information for you to share with the members of your team please.
     
Enron has partnered with Ford to provide special discounts to Enron employees on top of the rebates and discounts that normally apply.    The plan is called the Ford X Plan.   

Here's how it works: 

To get this discount you need this partner Code XB981 or either call 877-975-2600 or go to https://www.fordpartner.com/index.asp and enter the required information. 

Name
Address
Company
SSN
Etc. 

Upon providing this information you will be given or sent a PIN number.  Then you can go to any Ford dealership, tell them your an XPlan member, give them the PIN and tell them what car you want - no negotiating no haggling.  Any rebates and discounted interest rates still apply to this price. 

Regards
Frank
