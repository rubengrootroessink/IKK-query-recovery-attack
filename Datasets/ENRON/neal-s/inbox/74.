As discussed, here's the particulars on the Bee County  Ranch:
 
795+ ac, lots of oak trees, one of the higher hills in Bee  County.  Good mix of pasture and sage brush.  There's a water well and  tank.  
 
A real "honey hole".  Lots of quail and prime dove  hunting. Deer, hogs and supposedly some turkey.
 
Owner's name is Colton Brinkoeter.  Asking $675/acre, no  minerals.  Negotiable.  I think for that price you ought to get 1/4 -  1/2 of the minerals.
 
Ranch is three miles west of Mineral (NNW of Beeville about 15  miles).  His number is 361-358-2582.  I found out about it from a  mutual friend of ours, Bryan Key, also from Beeville.
 
P.S.  I've also attached my resume.  It looks like  our pipe deal fell through, and I am looking hard for a job back in  international marketing.  Let me know if you hear of anything.
