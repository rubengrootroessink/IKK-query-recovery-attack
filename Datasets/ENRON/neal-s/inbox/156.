Scott - Attached are my notes of the OUC deal that Jared thought you would like.  

Dan - We need to incorporate the terms and conditions that I have mentioned in the summary below into a confirmation sheet.  I'm assuming we have a Master Firm Agreement with Orlando Utilities, but if we don't, we need to get a contract drafted as well.  I will check in with you to discuss.

Thanks.
