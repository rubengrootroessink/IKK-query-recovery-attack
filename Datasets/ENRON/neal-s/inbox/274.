 is questionable for Monday's game against Green Bay, the third straight we=
ek his status has been in question due to continued pain in his quadriceps =
muscle. He will be limited again in practice, and it's probably a good idea=
 to keep him on reserve for Week 12 in your league.  Terrell Davis , RB DEN=

c knee surgery in time for Sunday's game agains! t ! Miami. He will practic=
e this week before a final decision is made, but we're skeptical the Bronco=

antasy values.  Keith Poole , WR DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Poole ha=
s bruised ribs that will likely keep him on the sidelines for Sunday's game=
 against Miami. If he can't play, Kevin Kaspar would start in his place, an=
d the Denver passing game would further suffer.  Rod Smith , WR DEN - Matty=
 Updated 11/27/01 Smith now has two sprained ankles, and is questionable fo=
r Sunday's game against Miami. If he can't play, then the Broncos might hav=
e to start Kevin Kaspar and Chris Cole at wideout, depending on Keith Poole=
's recovery from a rib injury.  James Jackson , RB CLE - Hunter Updated 11/=
27/01 Jackson's ankle remains sore, and he will be re-evaluated Wednesday t=
o determine his status for Sunday's game against Tennessee. Benjamin Gay an=
d Jamel White would continue to split carries if Jackson can't go.  Neil Ra=
ckers , K CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Bengals Head Coach Dick LeBeau =
said Monday he has not yet made a decision on the status of Rackers, who mi=
ssed two field-goal chances Sunday. He is 9-for-18 in field goals this seas=
on, and Jaret Holmes has been on the practice squad since Nov. 1. Rackers w=
ill likely retain the job for Sunday's game against Tampa Bay, but he's a v=
ery risky Fantasy starter based on his struggles.  Akili Smith , QB CIN - F=
ree Agent Updated 11/27/01 Bengals Head Coach Dick LeBeau said Monday that =
Smith might be promoted to No. 2 quarterback, according to The Cincinnati E=
nquirer . "If that's what they're going to do, maybe the Bengals need to ge=
t rid of me," Smith said, citing a desire to be traded if he's used in a mo=
p-up role. He's not a recommended Fantasy choice, although it's important t=
o note that he's now likely next in line if Jon Kitna gets hurt.  Terry All=
en , RB BAL - Tori Updated 11/27/01 Allen, who remains out with a broken ha=
nd, could return to the lineup on Dec. 16. With the Ravens losing Jason Bro=
okins to an injury, don't be surprised if Allen takes back the starting job=
 once healthy. Hold onto him if you have the room on your reserve list or p=
lay in a deeper league.  M! o! e Williams , RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/=
27/01 Williams becomes the Ravens' featured back after the injury to Jason =
Brookins. If you play in a deeper league or are desperate for a running bac=
k, consider picking up Williams, although you shouldn't expect him to post =
great stats unless the matchup is very favorable.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL =
- Tori Updated 11/27/01 Results of X-rays on Brookins' foot revealed a frac=
ture of a bone in his small toe, which will sideline him for at least four =
weeks and possibly the rest of the season. Moe Williams becomes the Ravens'=
 starting running back, and might be worth adding to your roster in a deepe=
r league.  Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 11/27/01 Chrebret did n=
ot practice Monday because of a shoulder injury. However, The New York News=
day reports that he is expected to play in Sunday's game.   Jake Arians , K=
 BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Arians has been released by the Bills. B=
uffalo has signed Shayne Graham to replace him.   Edgerrin James , RB IND -=
 JWillie Updated 11/2! 7/! 01 Colts coach Jim Mora said James' surgery to r=
epair a torn ligament in his left knee was successful Saturday in Miami.  M=
ora said he received the news from orthopedic surgeon Dr. Arthur Rettig, a =
team physician. "I spoke with him Saturday and he told me it went very well=
," Mora said. James, the two-time NFL rushing champion, injured the knee wh=
en he was tackled awkwardly late in a game at Kansas City on Oct. 25. He wa=
s placed on injured reserve last week. James' rehabilitation is expected to=
 take seven months. He is not expected to take part in either of the Colts =
offseason minicamps. Team president Bill Polian has not said whether James =
will be ready for the start of training camp.     Terry Glenn , WR NE - Mat=
ty Updated 11/27/01 Glenn could be put on injured reserve if he doesn't rec=
over from a hamstring injury soon. That would mean the end of his season, a=
nd perhaps the end of his Patriots career. "I haven't reached it yet," coac=
h Bill Belichick said Monday when asked when he would decide if the roster =
spot would be better spent on someone other than Glenn. "But as each day go=
es by, it gets a little bit closer."      Shayne Graham , K SEA - Free Agen=
t Updated 11/27/01 The Buffalo Bills signed Graham as their kicker Tuesday,=
 a day after Jake Arians was released following a missed point-after agains=
t the Miami Dolphins. Graham had been released by the Seattle Seahawks befo=
re the start of the season.   Stephen Alexander , TE WAS - Free Agent Updat=
ed 11/27/01 Alexander, who has been hampered by a ankle injury, returned to=
 action on Sunday. He didn't start, however, and may lose playing time to b=
oth Walter Rasby and Zeron Flemister for the rest of the season. Unless you=
 play in a deeper league, dropping Alexander is advisable.  Az-Zahir Hakim =
, WR STL - Neal/McKay Updated 11/27/01 Hakim, who is dealing with an ankle =
injury, played in Monday night's 24-17 loss to Tampa Bay. He had three catc=
hes for 29 yards in the game.   Kevan Barlow , RB SF - Tori Updated 11/27/0=
1 Barlow suffered a dislocated shoulder during Sunday's win over Indianapol=
is. "It's throbbing," Barlow told the Contra Costa Times. "I couldn't reall=
y sleep last night. I had to sleep sitting up. It's hurting." Barlow is lis=
ted as doubtful for Sunday's game against Buffalo, so be sure to place him =
on reserve.     Terrell Owens , WR SF - Martin Updated 11/27/01 Owens suffe=
red a sprained right foot on Sunday to go along with his sprained left ankl=
e. X-rays were negative, but Owens' foot was placed in a protec! ti! ve boo=
t as a precaution. He is expected to miss some practice time this week, but=
 he will be in the starting lineup on Sunday when the Niners face Buffalo. =
  Jeff Thomason , TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Thomason suffered a =
hyperextended knee during Sunday's loss to Washington. He missed practice o=
n Monday, and is status for Week 12 is uncertain at this time. The reserve =
tight end has very little value as a Fantasy player.   Donald Driver , WR G=
B - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Driver, who has been inactive for three str=
aight weeks due to a thigh injury, returned to practice on Monday. His stat=
us for Week 12 remains unclear, but he's not worth starting on your Fantasy=
 team in any event.   Tyrone Davis , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Da=
vis, who has been out all year due to a hamstring injury, will likely find =
out what his status with the Packers will be this week. Depending on his he=
alth, the team will either activate him, place him on injured reserve or cu=
t him altogehter.   James Stewart , RB DET - Hunter Updated 11/27/01 Stewar=
t, who suffered a neck stinger in last Thursday's game against Green Bay, i=
s expected to be available for Week 12. He'll have a tough time posting goo=
d Fantasy numbers against Chicago's tough run defense, but the lack of dept=
h at running back in the league makes it tough to bench him.   Charlie Batc=
h , QB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 According to the Detroit Free Pres=
s , Batch is expected to start Sunday's game against Chicago despite a groi=
n injury. "This is Charlie's offense," coach Marty Mornhinweg said. "He pra=
cticed a little bit today...he was in all weekend getting (the injury) trea=
ted...I would expect him close to full speed Wednesday." He'll likely lose =
snaps to rookie QB Mike McMahon, however, so starting Batch is a risky prop=
osition.   Jackie Harris , TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Harris miss=
ed last week's game against Denver due to a hamstring injury. The veteran t=
ight end is listed as day to day.   Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - Martin Upda! =
te! d 11/27/01 According to coach Dick Jaroun, Thomas' status for Week 12 i=
s still uncertain. In fact, the Bears don't expect to know if Thomas, who i=
s dealing with a hamstring injury, will be available until later in the wee=
k.   Brad Hoover , RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Hoover (neck) will =
likely be held out of practice this week. However, the Panthers are hopeful=
 that he'll be available for Sunday's game against New Orleans.   Chris Wei=
nke , QB CAR - Tori Updated 11/27/01 Despite his inconsistent play and 14 i=
nterceptions, Weinke's job as Carolina's No. 1 quarterback is secure. "Ther=
e've been quarterbacks who have gone on to be very successful that have gon=
e through times like this," coach George Seifert told the Charlotte Observe=
r. "Even though there are a number of these plays that haven't turned out a=
nd there have been disruptions in his play, I think, ultimately, it will be=
 more beneficial than not." While he may be the starting quarterback in Car=
olina, Weinke isn't worth a roster spot in most Fantasy leagues.   Frank Sa=
nders , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Sanders, who left Sunday's gam=
e against San Diego due to nagging hamstring injuries, is questionable for =
the Cards' Week 12 matchup at Oakland. However,! h! e is optimistic that he=
'll be available for the game. "I'll be there," Sanders told the Arizona Re=
public. "They're just real sore from doing a lot of running and jumping - n=
ormal wear and tear." In any event, keeping Sanders on your bench may be a =
good idea against the tough Oakland secondary.   Rob Moore , WR ARI - Marti=
n Updated 11/27/01 Moore (hamstring) was supposed to begin some light runni=
ng last week, but he ended up doing nothing of the sort. "He hasn't made a =
lot of progress," coach Dave McGinnis told the Arizona Republic. "We're goi=
ng to come to a point where we're going to have to make a decision." Moore,=
 who has missed the entire season due to injury, could be placed on the inj=
ured reserve list this week.   More Updates [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commiss=
