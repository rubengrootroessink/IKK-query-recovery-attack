Kam, last year when this deal was set up, I set up deal tickets extending into the future for 5 years (I would have extended it all the way to 2010 but the Risk people back then asked me not to).  I have a new ticket for each season since the volumes at each primary point and fuel change over the years and by season.  Extending Sitara 217969 through is going to be doubling volumes for one and secondly, it won't reflect the correct primary points for each season.  I would really like to be consulted about these kind of changes before they are made and maybe we and Scott Neal could sit down and figure out a better way to keep up with the value.  I'll run some facilitation reports and see if this has caused us any trouble that we may need to fix.

Thanks, Sabra

Sabra,

I have extended the current FP&L sitara #217969 to the end of the deal (2/2010).

Keeping the same deal # helps us keep up with the value.

I set it up with the volumes we booked in TAGG, I know the volumes and locations will change but if you could send me and Yuan an e-mail when you have made your change during bid week we will make the changes to the hedge deal.


Thanks,

Kam


ps.  Scott, you will not see any problems with this deal in the future.  Sorry for the trouble.
