Scott,

As discussed yesterday we really appreciate your help in moving the negotiations along for the Master with Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Company.

Just to give you some facts:
We do have a GISB with Williams, of which they are the Confirming Party. Williams has made a decision not to confirm any deals less than a month in term, this is breach of contract. We currently have over 800 deals pending execution as they are not sending paper. 

We have been unsuccessful for several months and the hold-up seems to be with Williams Legal group. Their Credit group is in favor of this Master as I understand it.
Below are the several people we have been in contact with over the last several months.

Legal:  Kelly Knowlton @ 918-573-5278

Debra Perlingiere in ENA Legal is handling the negotiations on our side and can be reached at 713-853-7658.
If you have any questions, please call me x54099.
Many thanks for your help !
Best Regards
Ellen
