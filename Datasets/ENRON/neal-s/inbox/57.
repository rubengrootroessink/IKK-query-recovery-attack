Nelson,

I have booked the TDC deal for the remainder of the term.  It is now in the Gulf3 book at Tenn/Zone1.  If locations need to change, and I'm sure they will, please let me know and I will make sure it is hedged correctly.  

sitara #778201

also,  if you could use the same sitara number every month for the central gas it would help make our reconciliation process much smoother.


Thanks,

Kam
