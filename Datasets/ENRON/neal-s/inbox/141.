Charles & Scott,

I wanted to circle back with both you with respect to employment
opportunities at Enron.  I am in the process of narrowing potential
opportunities.  As such, is there currently an opportunity to move forward
with Enron?  If so, please feel free to contact me.  In any event, I
appreciate your consideration.
