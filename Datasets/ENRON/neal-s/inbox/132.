Torrey,
	Well we finally have a final product description for our Sonat tier 2 product.  Tami DePaolis and Jeff Hodge have given there OK.
	Attached is the description along with some additional language for penalties that need to be included in the description and confirmations
	as well.  If you have any questions please give me or Tammi a call.

	thanx
