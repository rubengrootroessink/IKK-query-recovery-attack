Scott,
I overheard you talking about NY City studies earlier.  The two files attached were work in progress that I although not completed and a little rough I thought may be useful in their current form.  I am working with Sabina Rank to take over and complete all of my projects and daily fundamentals duties.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks,
Sean
