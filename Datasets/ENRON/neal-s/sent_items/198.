Julie,

Thank you so much for the tickets to the golf tournament.  I took my nephew and we had a great time.
I really appreciate you thinking of me.

Sincerely,

Scott Neal

Attached is the updated list of money market rates.  Of course you know, these rates are subject to change daily especially with the Fed possibly announcing another cut this afternoon.

If you have any questions or need anything, please let me know.

Julie
