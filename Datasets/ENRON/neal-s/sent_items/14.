Dear Body Shop Member:

During the UBS/Enron transition your Body Shop membership will continue without interruption.  We are working with UBS and Enron to transition payroll deductions and continue exterior door access to the Body Shop.  

While we are finalizing these changes please continue your Body Shop membership.  

Thank you,
The Body Shop
