Importance:	High

Hi Scott - 

Per my voice mail, we have another Enron South America visitor arriving at Enron on 5/24, PDVSA or Petroleum Venezuela.  Please let me know if you are available to deliver the same presentation you gave to Petrobras to PDVSA.  The time is 2:00 - 2:45 in 50MO3.

Objectives:	
Favorably respond to a request from PDVSA to educate them about the natural gas industry 
Impress PDVSA with Enron's professional staff and operations, i.e. Build familiarity and favorability of Enron

Background:
PDVSA is Enron's key strategic partner in Venezuela.  For PDVSA, this visit represents a major opportunity for them to learn about the business of an industry that they are only now beginning to develop.  Until recently, PDVSA was limited to the petroleum until the new formation of their gas unit.
PDVSA (Petroleum of Venezuela) is the largest and most important company in Venezuela.  
It is one of the most important energy corporations in the world.
It is a national corporation that establishes tight direct links with foreign energy companies as well as with the Minister of Energy and the government of Venezuela.  
They are an enterprise that is multidisciplinary within the energy market.  It comprises in area of trade, refining, exploration and production.  (In particular: gas, emissions, petroleum, carbon, petrochemicals, lubricants, fertilizers, and combustion.)
PDVSA is owner of many important companies like Citgo, Veba Oil, Refinery Isla, Borco, Bopec, and many others.
Due to the importance of globalization within the energy market, there are many agreements with PDVSA and foreign companies.

PDVSA Relationship with Enron Venezuela

Enron Venezuela has two strategic partnerships with PDVSA.  PDVSA will supply natural gas to ACCROVEN, a $415 million natural gas extraction, fractionation, storage and refrigeration project with facilities in San Joaquin, Santa Barbara, and Jose that Enron recently constructed and will own and operate.  Enron is also developing a $700 million LNG project, which will include PDVSA as an equity partner and as the supplier of natural gas.  The final hurdle is authorization from the Venezuelan government that there are sufficient natural gas for the project.

OSCAR MONTENEGRO - PDVSA GAS 
Superintendant, Contracts & Negotiations
