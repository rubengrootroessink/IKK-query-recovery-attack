Scott, As you know, Alex and Irena will be supporting Central in the new building .  That breaks up the support/sharing that occurs now when Kim is away from her desk.  I believe that the East needs Kim and 1 other full time to support our Admin needs.  That is in line with our budget.  I think that Ina was suggesting that we share with another group, which may undermine the service that we need.  Kim has suggested Daniel as a possible 2nd to her.  I believe that we should plan to bring Daniel on as a Temp when we get into the new building and then decide after a month or 2 as to what we want to do full time moving forward.  Any thoughts ?  yes ? no?
