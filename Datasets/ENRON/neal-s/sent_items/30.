Scott, 
Attached is the file with Lavo's changes.  Note he's added a couple of interest rate desks and put gas weather and another fundies person in - Bob Superty was looking for 3 logistics support people that should be on the floor,  Tammy Jaquet, Richard Pinion, and Natalie Baker.  Please assign them and the assistants a desk.

We are out of time on turning this churn in.  I must have it by noon.  I will be meeting with the move team tomorrow afternoon to set move dates.  I'm being asked about  the trading simulation for next week and since your churns aren't set I can't provide an answer.

Ina, please pull in whomever you need to work on the churn,  be sure and get with Superty's asst to help you with those people etc.

Regards,
Tammy
