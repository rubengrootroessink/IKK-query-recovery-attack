Scott,

I am the executive recruiter you spoke to today about new job opportunities.
Thanks very much for your time.  As discussed, I've attached my contact
information for your records.  Please send your resume back to me in Word
format and let's make arrangements to discuss your background and interests
in new job opportunities.

You can find more information about my firm at www.firstcallassociates.com.
We are very familiar with the nuances of the energy trading business and
have built relationships with many energy companies in North America
enabling us to present qualified employees for their consideration.

Most of our candidates (as you were) come referred to us by people we have
worked with in the past.  If you know any good people in front, mid or back
office positions who may be interested in new job opportunities, feel free
to pass along my name or let me know how I can contact them.  Any referrals
that result in placements will not be forgotten.  Thanks again and I look
forward to speaking with you soon.
