Dear PeeWee Baseball '02 Player:

It's hard to believe that the 2002 SBMSA Baseball season is just around
the corner, but it is!  This year's Skills Evaluations for Westchester
PeeWees (3rd and 4th grades) will be held at the Spring Forest fields on
Saturday and Sunday, February 2nd and 3rd.  More information on this
will be telephoned to each player early next week that will detail the
exact time to show-up.  For those of us, however, that are in need of a
little "warm-up" before the evaluations, informal batting practice
(machine) and fielding drills will be going on next Wednesday and
Thursday (Jan 30 and 31st) at the Spring Forest fields from 6 - 8 pm.
To participate, come by either day (or both) with your glove, bat and
batting helmet.

See you next week,

David Benninger
Westchester PeeWee Commissioner
