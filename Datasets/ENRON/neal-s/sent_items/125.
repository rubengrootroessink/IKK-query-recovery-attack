Karen,

I had not thought about the title issue but my view is that if the person is a viable candidate and wants to pursue this track then title should be a non issue.  I don't see any problem with having a current manager in the program.  Having said all that, I don't know John Lavoratto's view.

Hi Scott,

Eric Boyt is back in town and we are following up with him on the Trading Track,   as he is a manager currently, he is concerned that this would be a step down.   From a salary perspecitve he is on a higher scale than that of the preent trading track individuals... we would have to take him into the trading track as a manager?   I am meeting with him today to discuss the TT in more detail.. you may want to touch base with him also on this if you have time.

Thanks, Karen.

We were thinking of having another interview session for the Trading Tract later this month.   I've been screening outside resumes but internally we haven't received many suggestions from each of you about other people already at Enron.  If you think anyone could qualify send the name to Karen Buckley.  If we don't have enough candidates, we will wait until the new analysts and associates arrive and do a session then.

Lavo
