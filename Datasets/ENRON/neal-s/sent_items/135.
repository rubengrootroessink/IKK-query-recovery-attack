Thanks a bunch for listening to us last night.  We look forward to showing
you our
stuff.  Could you possibly schedule us next Wednesday afternoon at your
convenience?
JP is going to Phoenix and won't be back till late on Friday.  Conversely,
if your
schedule opens up this afternoon, let me know.

Thanks again.

K.
