Charles & Scott,

In case this email transmission below was not successful, I want to take
this opportunity to resend this email with my resume.  Hopefully, an
opportunity at Enron is available which matches my experience.

Again, thank you for your consideration.

Mark Evans

Charles & Scott,

I wanted to circle back with both you with respect to employment
opportunities at Enron.  I am in the process of narrowing potential
opportunities.  As such, is there currently an opportunity to move forward
with Enron?  If so, please feel free to contact me.  In any event, I
appreciate your consideration.
