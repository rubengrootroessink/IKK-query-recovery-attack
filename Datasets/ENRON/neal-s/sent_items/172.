Good morning, Scott!

It was such a pleasure talking with you earlier this week.  I learned a great deal from our discussion, and I want to thank you again for taking the time to explain the details of bid week to me.

I've attached the story below for your review.  Please let me know if you have any suggestions or concerns -- I want to make sure it is accurate.  I'm happy to make any necessary changes.  Is it possible to get this to me by the end of today?  I apologize for the quick turnaround time.  Many, many thanks in advance!
