Below is the summary of the deal I passed out earlier this week. 



I have not closed on the 1Bcf supply purchase, but should have that done at 
the beginning of next week.  The gas price will be GDA-Mid for NGPL (La.) + 
$0.025.  This gas can be called upon hourly up to 50,000 MMBtu/day.  Example 
of the pricing mechanism (that NGPL prefers) is as follows:

Gas Nom  Gas Flow  Applicable Gas Daily Publication
Monday (intraday) Monday  Tuesday
Monday  Tuesday  Tuesday
Weekend  Weekend  Monday (unless Monday is a holiday, then Tuesday)

Let me know if you perfer a differnt structure.
