     John,

     Touching grass or other growing things with the club is NOT considered
     grounding it.  When the ground is covered with grass or other ground
     cover, the club is considered grounded if you rest the weight of the
     club on the ground cover.  Practice swings also can touch growing
     objects in the hazard, but not the ground.  If a player were to ground
     his club with several practice swings it is considered only one
     violation of the Rules, not one for every swing.

     I hope this helps.

If a ball is in a water hazard and the player tries to hit the ball out
of the hazard, if he touches any grass that is growing (not the ground),
is that considered grounding your club?  Also, if a practice swing is
taken, and the grass (not the ground) is touched, is that a penalty?
What if more than one practice swing is taken?  Is there a penalty for
each swing?

Thanks.

John Griffith
