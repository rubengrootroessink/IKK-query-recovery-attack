Natural is now producing hourly "0" bottoming patterns to go  along with the daily and weekly "0" patterns.  If there is anything left on  the downside, it's from here.  A close above 228 today is a good daily buy  signal on my work and should lead to a more sustainable rally.
 
Crude has short-term targets into tomorrow for a low.   Price around 2005 - 2040.  Still looking for a rally to see $23+ into  early-mid Feb.
 
By the way, since my client base has shrunk in the last  couple of months, any suggestions for possible contacts who you think might find  my work useful?  Thanks,
