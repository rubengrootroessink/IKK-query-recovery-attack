So, I looked up flights to Afganistan.  Did you know that they have 20 airports?  Given the circumstances, there are no flights going there.  So, I will have to go to Pakistan first.  It will only cost $2028.00.  So, let me know how you would like to pay for it.  Obviously they prefer a credit card.  Wouldn't you rather go there than to New York?  :)
