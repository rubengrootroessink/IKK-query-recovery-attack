Dear Body Shop Members,
"Healthy Habits for the Holidays" << OLE Object: Microsoft Clip Gallery >> October 22nd - December 14th

Week Five - Healthy Habit Tip
Stress Management:   "Take Five"  It takes only 5-minutes to recharge your batteries with renewed energy.
Relax and sit in a comfortable chair.
If possible close your door and your eyes.
Slowly take deep breaths, inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth.
Focus on a beautiful scene, special moment, happy occasion, or warm feeling.
Taking a few of these mini-breaks throughout your day will help you remain focused, calm, cool and collected.
Weight Management:  Fat Free Cookies
Don't be fooled by the term "fat free" on a food label.  While there are a myriad of fat free products on the market today, many of them are loaded with calories and concentrated sugars.  May fat free versions of foods contain only a few less calories per serving then their fatty counterparts.  Five fat free cookies 50 calories each still adds up to a significant caloric intake.  Be a smart shopper.  Compare calorie and fat contents when choosing products and practice moderation when eating high sugar or high fat foods. 

Members who workout a minimum of (3) times each week between October 22nd and December 14th will be entered in the weekly drawing for massages, apparel, and more.  (Weekly participation based on members Enron ID badge check-ins at the Body Shop Front Desk).
