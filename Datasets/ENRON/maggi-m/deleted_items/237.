Great on this end!  Phoenix Open tomorrow, 1:20 tee time Sat at the 500
Club, taking the boat out Sunday on Canyon Lake.  It's a wild sight to drop
a line, real in rainbow, all within forty feet of Saguaro cactus.

I hear UBS is locking folks in at this point, or at least trying.  What
percentage of existing natgas/power front office will be retained?  I would
assume they'll leave the operation in Houston?
