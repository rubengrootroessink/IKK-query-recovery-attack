I am going to have lunch with a client at noon  Friday in the Westheimer and Sam Houston tollway area.  If it would work  out OK for you I thought we could try to play somewhere out 59 South, so you  will be closer to home.  If you can I would like to get some dinner after  we play as well.  I will give you a call after the close this afternoon to  see what you think.
