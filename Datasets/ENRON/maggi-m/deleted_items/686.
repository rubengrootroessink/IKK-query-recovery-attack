John,

You are correct, when you compute the historical volatility you need to use=
 252 days to annualize the volatility.
This is because the historical data only existed for trading days.=20

The common practice here at Enron for computing Time to maturity is Calenda=
r Days (=3D Maturity date - valuation date).
Therefore the days in Year is 365.25.  So the implied volatility from the E=
IMPVOL function uses 365.25 days as one year.

If you want to convert you can apply the following formula

historical vol * sqrt(252)    vs.  implied vol * sqrt(365.25).

Let me know if this helps.=20

Zimin,

I have a question about historical volatility.  The way I have been calcula=
ting historical volatility is that I take the standard deviation of the log=
 returns of the price settles.  I then take that number (daily volatility) =
and multiply by the square root of the number of trading days to come up wi=
th an annualized volatility.  The number of trading days that I have been u=
sing is 252, however I do not know if this is correct.  What I am trying to=
 do is calculate a historical volatility that would be comparable to the im=
plied volatility that we are calculating our books with.  The implied volat=
ilities are iterated using the euro function.  I get a straddle quote and I=
 iterate what volatility would be used to come up with that price ( I also =
look at the eimvol function).  I know that we use a 365.25 trading day conv=
ention in pricing our options, does this mean that to come up with a compar=
able historical volatility number I need to use 365.25 to convert the daily=
 historical volatility to an annualized volatility?

Thanks again for your help.

John Griffith
