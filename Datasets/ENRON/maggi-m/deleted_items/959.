I just wanted to forward this information to you just in case you have not
received it.  Could you please forward the info to Eric Sturm and anyone
else who you think might want to attend?

I hope all is well.

A memorial service has been planned for Marisa on Oct 13.
It will be held at St. Anthony's Church in West Harrison, NY.
I can get directions to the church if you think anyone in Houston would want
them.

I plan on attending and am happy to house you/others that will be in the
area.

Please spread the word to anyone who you think should know (I dont know many
of her trading friends)and let me know if you are planning on coming.

I am here to help any way possible.

Take good care.

Rita
