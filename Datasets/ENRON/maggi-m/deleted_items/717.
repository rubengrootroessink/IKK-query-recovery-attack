Mike, I hope you had a nice time in Florida.  Amy and I had a great time with Matty over the weekend.  He is so cute and was very well-behaved for us.

I was just looking at the Enron website again.  I was reading more about the analyst program, which sounds like a great learning opportunity.  I understand that you may not be able to help me right now, as the market is somewhat tight.  I would definitely appreciate your trying.  I have attached my resume for you to review or forward to the appropriate personnel.

I am excited about the opportunity, and, of course, the possibilities.

Thanks again Mike.

Eliot
