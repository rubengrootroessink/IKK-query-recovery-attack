I think that this is what I said:

You better be in a great mood today!  It's turkey eve, it's cold outside and perfect weather for hot chocolate!  Then I started to sing you some song, but I can't remember which one.  It was a christmas song.  and I told you that you were missing out because you have ever heard me sing.  it was dumb, but funny at the time.
