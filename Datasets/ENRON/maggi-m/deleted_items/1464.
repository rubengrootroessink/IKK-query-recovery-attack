I am really not wanting to come back.  We are about to leave Heaven!  I am freaking out!  I take the LSAT Saturday and I have barely studied!  That's another hole in the NY trip.  But at this rate, I think that a vacation to NY and some shopping sounds like a better alternative.  I am starting to get nervous about seeing Kori tomorrow!
