You are not going to tell John that you can't make dinner.  You need to go.  I can't stay out that long anyway, but I am planning on leaving early.  Why are you torturing yourself by reading that e-mail?  A tubby?  Is that what you call a bath?  Cute.  It doesn't bother me to talk to you about anything.  You can talk to me anytime.  Studying?  Are you kidding, I just got home and I am not motivated at all.  I think that I am kidding myself about trying to go to school.  I don't want to do anything but sit on the couch.  I have gotten so lazy.  That is why I am going to start playing soccer again in January.  You can make fun of me if you want to.  Cheer up.
