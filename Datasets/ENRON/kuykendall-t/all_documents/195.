we had a couple of different deal numbers that we were using for december 
purchases from sg interests.  we bought a volume of 689 at a price of 9.25 on 
12/21 on deal 528768.  however, the next day - we bought a volume of 689 at a 
price of 9.84 on 12/22 on deal 510431.  the counterparty agrees with me and 
they will be reinvoicing us.
