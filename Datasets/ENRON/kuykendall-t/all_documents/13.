Attached is a draft of the comments we intend to file in the subject 
proceeding.  This is obviously a "work-in-progress".    It has been forwarded 
for review to several other people in the company, including the Enron lawyer 
who is working on the litigation on the lawsuit about electricity pricing, so 
there may be other changes.  If they are significant and there is time, I 
will run them by you again.

Please review and contact me ASAP (and no later than 2:00) if you have any 
comments or input.  This filing must be made this afternoon, and we have to 
give the D.C. lawyer time to make final revisions to the document and get it 
to FERC.

Thanks.
