Subject: Christmas Lunch

Christmas is just around the corner and it's time to plan our "all girl" 
Christmas lunch and gift exchange.  For the new employess, all the girls on 
the desk draw names and exchange gifts at a Christmas lunch.  Gift price 
limit is $15.  We are looking at date range December 13 - 18th.  If I could 
get feed back on what dates are good for you, so I can plan our lunch.  I am 
also taking suggestions for a place to have our lunch.  Please let me know if 
you do not want to participate, we need to draw names very soon.

Suggestions:
