these charges are not valid  - we will not pay penalties on a swing deal at a 
constrained point.  several people on the desk discussed this potential 
problem, and the trader at agave has already been notified that will do not 
intend on paying any penalty charges.  this deal was done on a gtc - spot 
contract, not on their firm agreement.
