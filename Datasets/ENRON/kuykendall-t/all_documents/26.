Ken:

Subject to final confirmation with the gas desk in Houston, Enron is prepared 
to provide gas supply to CanFibre according to the terms on the attached.  If 
you want to do something, please arrange for the first wire transfer (or 
posting of the L/C).

I will be out of the office for the rest of the week, but calling in for 
messages.

Thanks

Chris
