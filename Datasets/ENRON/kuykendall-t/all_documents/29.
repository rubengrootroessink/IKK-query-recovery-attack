Hello , my name is Tori Kuykendall (One Pass BJ927934).  My husband, Patrick( 
One Pass VF751282), and I have been One Pass members for a few years now as 
well as elite members on several occasions.  We also use Chase Continental 
Visa exclusively, and my husband is a President's Club member.  I have made 
Continental my airline of choice for as long as I can remember booking my own 
travel arrangements and have been a very satisfied customer in the past.  
This morning, however, I had a very bad experience.  I booked tickets for a 
vacation back on September 4th for a trip from Houston to New York on 
December 1.  Since I booked the ticket, I became pregnant and found out from 
my doctor last week that I will still be unable to travel on December 1st due 
to complications with my pregnancy.  My doctor indicated to me that I may not 
be able to fly at all during my pregnancy, which is due to end in June.  I 
spoke to Leroy Peterson this morning to explain the situation, and he 
indicated that all he could do was give me credit that would expire on 
September 5th, 2001 and that a $75 service would be charged to me next time I 
book a ticket for me or my husband.  I understand that this is the same 
policy that you would have given me if I had just decided that I didn't feel 
like taking a vacation this weekend.  In my opinion, this is an unacceptable 
policy in the event of medical complications.  As you can see with my 
situation, it is unlikely that my husband and I will be able to plan a 
vacation by September of 2001 considering we will hopefully have a 2 month 
old child.  I repeatedly asked Leroy if there was anyone else who could help 
me or anyone I could talk to in order to get some kind of exception to your 
policy.  I indicated that I could provide a doctor's note if necessary.  He 
was very rude to me, stating "You don't have to ask me 7 different times for 
the same thing - I already told you NO!"  I had to cancel a flight for work 
about a month ago on Southwest airlines for the same reason, but I was hoping 
that I would be able to fly again by now.  For your information, your 
competitor was very helpful.  They accepted my doctor's note, gave me a 
credit good for one year, and will allow me to change the ticket to another 
person's name if I am still unable to use it.  That ticket was also booked as 
a non-refundable fare.  Although I have always used Continental  for my 
personal travel, the treatment I have had in this difficult time has 
definitely made me second-guess my future choices.  If there is anything you 
can do to help, I would greatly appreciate it.
