 Latest NFL Player News 

 Cade McNown , QB CHI -  Updated 12/13/00 
 McNown will return as the Bears' starting quarterback for this Sunday's game 
against the 49ers after missing six weeks with a separated shoulder. Fantasy 
owners who have advanced this far into the playoffs should not consider 
picking up McNown for this week's game. He is too much of a risk after 
missing an extended period of time, especially at this point of the season.   

 Vinny Testaverde , QB NYJ -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Testaverde has been upgraded from questionable to probable for Sunday's game 
against the Lions. He injured his groin in last week's game in Oakland, but 
has returned to practice and is taking his normal reps with the first team 
offense. Fantasy owners who have Testaverde are breathing a collective sigh 
of relief as the Fantasy playoffs near an end. The Jets' quarterback should 
have some success this week against Detroit, whose secondary has been ravaged 
by injuries.   

 Dolphins , DT MIA -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Miami's defense once again showed why it is one of the league's finest 
units, holding the Buccaneers to only three field goals in a 16-13 loss. 
Tampa Bay's touchdown came on 31-yard interception return by Bucs' linebacker 
Jaime Duncan. The Dolphins host the Colts this week, whom they held to only 
14 points back in Week 12. Starting the Miami D is a must during the final 
weeks of the Fantasy playoffs.  

 Olindo Mare , K MIA -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Mare has nailed his last 12 field goals in a row, including two on Sunday 
against the Bucaneers. Look for the Miami placekicker to get a few chances to 
score this week against the Colts, as the Dolphins looks to put a 
stranglehold on the AFC East title.    

 Tony Martin , WR MIA -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Martin caught five passes for 67 yards in his first start since returning 
from a foot injury. With very little playing time under his belt in recent 
weeks, Martin is a very risky player to consider for your starting lineup 
during the Fantasy playoffs.  

 Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Gadsden caught four passes for 75 yards but was held out of the end zone in 
last week's game against the Buccaneers. He faces a Colts' secondary this 
week that held him to only 30 yards receiving in Week 12. However, he did 
score a touchdown in the game. Gadsden is a cinch starter this week in 
leagues requiring three starting wideouts, and should also be considered for 
leagues with two receiver sets as well.   

 Adam Vinatieri , K NE -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Vinatieri has been one of the league's most accurate  placekickers in recent 
weeks, converting on 18 of his last 19 field goal attempts. He should get his 
chances against the Bills this week, especially if Buffalo's defense 
struggles like it did on Monday night. Unless you have one of the league's 
elite kickers on your roster, giving Vinatieri the start is a good idea.   

 Jermaine Wiggins , TE NE -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Wiggins has been a real surprise since being signed by the Patriots two 
weeks ago. In his first two games with New England, Wiggins has caught nine 
passes for 80 yards and touchdown - decent numbers for a tight end. If you 
lose Chad Lewis becuase of Philly's bye week and need a replacement, picking 
up Wiggins could pay off.   

 Raymont Harris , RB NE -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Harris, who was just recently re-signed by New England, carried the ball 
only three times for 14 yards in his first game back. With the Patriots 
constantly rotating tailbacks, Harris' Fantasy value is in serious question. 
It's good idea to avoid all New England tailbacks at this point in the 
season.   

 Troy Brown , WR NE -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Brown has caught two touchdowns in the last two weeks and is making a case 
to be on your Fantasy playoff team late in the year. He will face a Buffalo 
secondary this week that has been hurt by injuries, so giving Brown the start 
in leagues that require three wideouts isn't such a bad option.     

 Ricky Watters , RB SEA -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Watters missed Tuesday's practice with a turf toe injury. Watters was able 
to play at Denver this past week despite the problem. Don't expect him to 
miss this week's game against Oakland.   

 Terry Glenn , WR NE -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Glenn finally got into the end zone last week against Chicago, which is a 
good sign for Fantasy owners at this stage of the season. He will get his 
chances to score this week against the Bills, who have really been hurt by 
injuries on defense.   

 Napoleon Kaufman , RB OAK -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Kaufman has a bruised right leg in addition to his quadriceps injury. He 
might not play at Seattle, and Terry Kirby might be activated. Randy Jordan 
and Zack Crockett would see more playing time with both Kaufman and Jon 
Ritchie out.    

 Kevin Faulk , RB NE -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Faulk will likely be splitting time with both J.R. Redmond and Raymont 
Harris for the remainder of the season, which is not the scenario Fantasy 
owners are looking for at this time of the year. There is only one Faulk in 
the NFL who deserves to start in your Fantasy playoffs - and he plays in St. 
Louis.   

 J.R. Redmond , RB NE -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Redmond only saw limited action last week against the Bears because of his 
injured ribs, which have taken a toll on his production. It isn't certain how 
much playing time he will get in the final two weeks, so it's a good idea to 
keep  Redmond on your bench during the Fantasy playoffs.    

 Cardinals , DT ARI -  Updated 12/13/00 
 You want to talk about defensive inefficiency? Arizona's defense has given 
up an average of 32.4 points per game over their last five games. If for some 
reason you've held onto the Cardinals' defesne this long, you're probably 
already out of your league's playoffs. If not, make sure to look anywhere but 
Arizona for a starting defense.   

 Cary Blanchard , K ARI -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Blanchard has converted on only four of his last nine field goal attempts 
for Arizona, which has decreased his already low Fantasy value. Being the 
placekicker on a team with an enemic offense doesn't help, either - the Cards 
have only scored 42 points over the last four weeks. Give Blanchard the boot 
for the remainder of the Fantasy playoffs.   

 Frank Sanders , WR ARI -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Will the real Frank Sanders please stand up? After three poor performances, 
Sanders caught four passes for 90 yards and a score against Jacksonville. 
Fantasy owners never know what they're getting with Sanders from week to 
week, which is why he isn't a viable option during the playoffs.   

 David Boston , WR ARI -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Boston struggled to produce for Fantasy owners against Jacksonville last 
week, and will likely be in for another rough week against the Ravens. 
Baltimore sports the number one defense in the NFL, and has allowed only 
eight touchdowns through the air the entire season. Avoid using Boston this 
week if at all possible.   

 Thomas Jones , RB ARI -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Jones had 40 yards on seven carries in last week's loss to the Jaguars. The 
rookie could see added carries as the season comes to an end, but he still 
shouldn't be considered a starter during the Fantasy playoffs.  

 Torry Holt , WR STL -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Holt has a slight hip injury but will play in this week's game.  Expect him 
to maintain a high level of play during the final rounds of the Fantasy 
playoffs.    

 Herman Moore , WR DET -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Moore had a headache from hitting his head on the turf in the Lions' first 
offensive play Sunday.  He was knocked groggy, but X-rays showed no damage.  
However, if you put him in your Fantasy lineup at this point in the season 
his production will damage your playoff hopes.  Avoid using him if you 
can.         

 Alfred Pupunu , TE DET -  Updated 12/13/00 
 The Lions cut tight end Alfred Pupunu and signed safety Ryan Stewart. 
Pupunu, a former San Diego Charger, has no Fantasy value right now.   

 Eddie George , RB TEN -  Updated 12/13/00 
 George re-injured the big toe on his right foot during Sunday's game, and 
took a pain-killing injection and is wearing an immobilizing boot to help in 
his rehabilitation. His Fantasy owners have to be hoping he'll play against 
Cleveland, a team against which he has 344 rushing yards and seven TDs in his 
last three games, on Sunday.  

 Steve McNair , QB TEN -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Coach Jeff Fisher said McNair's sprained ankle is "swollen, stiff and sore," 
but it's far improved over where he was last week. McNair is expected to play 
Sunday against Cleveland, and we can't help but expect good numbers from him 
after his impressive three-TD performance last Sunday against Cincinnati.  

 Steelers , DT PIT -  Updated 12/13/00 
 The Steelers will be without strong safety Lee Flowers for Saturday's game 
against Washington. Flowers is second on the team in tackles and is tied for 
the lead in forced fumbles, and has an undisclosed knee injury. Ainsley 
Battles will get the start in his place. Pittsburgh's defensive unit hasn't 
been posting great numbers in recent weeks, so it might be wise to skip using 
it against Washington on Saturday.   

 Courtney Hawkins , WR PIT -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Hawkins has lost his starting job at split end to Troy Edwards, after a poor 
performance last Sunday against the Giants. Hawkins had just two catches for 
seven yards in the game, and hasn't been getting it done in recent weeks. He 
has no Fantasy value the remainder of the season.  

 Troy Edwards , WR PIT -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Edwards will get the start at split end, in place of Courtney Hawkins, for 
Saturday's game against Washington. He had 61 catches playing there last 
season, but wasn't as successful at flanker this year. Despite this switch, 
we don't forecast good Fantasy numbers from Edwards over the final two weeks. 
 

 Kordell Stewart , QB PIT -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Stewart was given a day off from practice on Tuesday in order to rest his 
sprained right calf. He said that the decision was a precautionary measure, 
and that he'd be back in practice Wednesday and will start Saturday against 
Washington. Stewart has a tough matchup with this Redskins pass defense - 
he's a risky start during your Fantasy playoffs.  

 Vinny Testaverde , QB NYJ -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Testaverde has been upgraded from questionable to probable for Sunday's game 
against the Lions. He injured his groin in last week's game in Oakland, but 
has returned to practice and is taking his normal reps with the first team 
offense. Fantasy owners who have Testaverde are breathing a collective sigh 
of relief as the Fantasy playoffs near an end. The Jets' quarterback should 
have some success this week against Detroit, whose secondary has been ravaged 
by injuries.
