Subject: April 2001 Nomination


All-

The total nomination for month of April 2001 is 10,506MMBtu per day.  This
includes:

1. 4,135MMBtu/day purchase from Engage @ Kingsgate (4,006MMBtu/day @ Malin);
2. 3,000MMBtu/day APEA gas;
3. 1,000MMBtu/day balance of year strip purchased on behalf of Azusa @
$7.71/MMBtu;
4. 2,000MMBtu/day under two separate fixed contracts of 1,000MMBtu/day each;
4. 500MMBtu/day March 2001 through Feb strip purchased @ $7.63;

Losses on the PG & E line have decreased from March 2001 to 3.12%.  We have
not sold any of the APEA gas (3,000MMBtu/day)at this time.

To review the phone conversation between Jan and me, we are planning to shut
down our last steam plant for maintenance from midnight March 30, 2001
through 1800 or so April 11, 2001.  Kim and I have arranged for Enron to
purchase the non-APEA gas during that period.  At this time, we believe that
the power plant will burn enough gas during the last 20 days of the month to
use the APEA gas.  If anything changes, I will notify you.

If you have any questions, please contact me.

Thanks.

-Steve
