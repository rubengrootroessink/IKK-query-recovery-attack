We have two new products on the west desk that we would like to launch march 
1st.  The descriptions are set up and ready to go, but we need to make these 
RESTRICTED products just like the EP Blanco.  The customer list, however, 
will be different than the blanco list.  We need to get on this right away.  
Please let me know what I need to do.
