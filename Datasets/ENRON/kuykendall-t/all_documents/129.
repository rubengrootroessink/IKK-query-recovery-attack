what we decided is that we are all bringing something and i provide the 
drinks.  i havent heard back from everyone yet but my gut instinct is that we 
will need at least one extra person.  it looks like everyone that was there 
last time is coming again and also kristi said she would be there, but that 
still leaves us short.  i hope the pool construction doesnt disrupt y'all too 
much.  the good thing is that my dad is overseeing it and he is being really 
hard on the guys, making sure they are as clean and quick as they can 
possibly be.  kim already said that jeffrey cant wait to come swimming.  
we'll have to get a water basketball goal - pat will love playing with all 
the kids.
