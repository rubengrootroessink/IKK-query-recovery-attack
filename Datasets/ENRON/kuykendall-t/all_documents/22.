hey renata.  how's everything going with you guys.  i know i never respond to 
any emails - i usually just get too busy.  sorry about that.  anyway, i 
wanted to catch up and to let you know that pat and i are going to be 
parents!  i still cant believe it.  i'm due in june.  anyway, we moved into a 
new house in katy, close to my parents. (had to be prepared).  hope 
everything's going great with y'all.  give me an update!  take care.
