I made some minor enhancements to your document.  Specifically, I inserted
the word "team" into the document as much as possible.  I also replaced the
word "group" with "team" as Dynegy focuses on this aspect...  My changes are
noted in BOLD-BLUE text..

how's this for the daily update:    "Today was a very difficult day for
us as market uncertainty continued.  Recent news reports, including The
Wall Street Journal article today, have speculated about possible
mergers, takeovers and equity investors as options that Enron is
considering.  The reason you have not seen us responding to these
reports is that it is our corporate policy not to comment on market
speculation.  However, I will tell you that we are evaluating all
options to protect the financial stability of this company.  I will keep
you updated on developments as they occur" 
 
 
hmmmmmmmmmm.........
