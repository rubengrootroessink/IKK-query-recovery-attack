the plan sounds good to me - i think signs are usually enough -- just put a few out at all the possible routes

Hey guys!

Looks like the driveway sale is on for Saturday morning Oct 27th 7am-Noon.
I was thinking if you wanted to bring stuff over to set up we could put it
in the garage on friday night and then you guys could meet at our house
around 645am on Sat. and we can drag it all out in the driveway.  If we wait
to get started setting stuff on tables until sat morning, we would have to
start really early.  I know this is early, but believe me those garage sale
people get started early and by noon things will be dead.

The only request I have is that you label all your stuff and stay to help
sale it.  Depending on the cost, I may put an add in the chronicle.  Or I
may just put a sign out on South Braeswood by the JCC.  What do you guys
think?
