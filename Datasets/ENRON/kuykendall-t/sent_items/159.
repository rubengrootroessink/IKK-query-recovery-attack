Probably best to just give her a card and then drop it off for her. No need
to lug something that heavy upstairs.

I bought Jennifer's gift last week -- I ended up getting them a stroller
since what we originally picked out had already been purchased.

I wanted to get your opinion on something -- the stroller box is pretty big
and heavy.  I'm not sure how much luck I would have getting it up to the
second story of Susan's house, so what I was thinking was that we could
give her a card which says what we got her and either leave the actual gift
downstairs at Susan's house during the shower or in the back of my Jeep and
I could drop it off at Ed & Jennifer's house after the shower.  Also, if we
go with the card idea, do you think I should still wrap the stroller box?

Let me know what you think.  I'll be at work today until 4:30.  I'm taking
off tomorrow so if you need to get in touch with me tomorrow, just call me
at home and leave a message if I'm not there (713-721-7101).

See you Saturday!!!
