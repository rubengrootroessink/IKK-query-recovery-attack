Jeff,

If there is no limit to size, we would ideally like to move everything within the following directories:

o:\ect_trading\West
r:\webcontent\GasTrading\west_desk

Let me know if we need to narrow these anymore.  They include all west desk files on the network excluding those in the central fundies directories.  Also, will we have a mechanism to transfer individual network directories from the H: drive?  In not, we'll move everyone's directories into one of the above directories.  Thanks.

Mat
