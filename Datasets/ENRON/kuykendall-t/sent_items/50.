I sent this message to colin originally and, since he's out, I am forwarding it to you.  I'm not really sure who the appropriate person is.  I also just realized that I forgot to 
include the attachment on the original message - oops.  Anyway, could you take a look at this sheet and let me know what you could come up with?  
I'd like to build something that looks like the "price sheet" tab. Thanks.

This is a spreadsheet that we used to have in our fundies packet a while back.  It is no longer being maintained, but I was wondering if you could cook something up that looks similar to it -- linking to the fundies price database.  Let me know.  Thanks.
