okay - so here's the deal - ugh - i hate to say this but we may have to postpone again.  pat's parents were supposed to come last weekend and they didnt because pat's dad was sick, so they are thinking of coming this weekend instead.  they usually leave pretty early on sunday, but with your time constraints with the foleys thing - i dont know if we'll be able to squeeze it in the middle.  i'll let you know if anything changes - if not, it may be back to the drawing board.
 
i saw terra, di ,and nicole this weekend in austin - it was great to hang out with nicole if only for a little bit.  
 
how's john's job search going?  it's pretty rough out there - i've been thinking about you guys alot, hoping he can get something soon.
 
anyway - i'll let you go -- take care.

What a cutie!  Will I be able to see her in person on the 28th?  You are
welcome to bring her!

Are you still up for next Sunday.  If so....ya'll could plan on coming at
12:30 or so.  We can cook out and also take a tour of the canals on our
little boat if ya'll are up for it and ...... if the weather cooperates.
If Erin isn't ready for her boat rides we can take turns going!

John and I have to go to Memorial City that night for a opening party.
It's casual, but we would need to start getting ready around 4 or so!

What do you think?

Cathy
