Here are Jake's thoughts on the situation.  Chris said he would be willing
to take you to lunch - completely under the radar if you can break away
sometime.  He said you can also just call him at home to discuss how the
environment is (team vs. individuals focused on bonuses).  He also indicated
the package for your level is in the six figures.  I have all his
information if you need it.  By the way, he reports up through Randy right
now...

On another topic.  Rick Riley thinks we are about to see capitulation in
Enron.  He thinks we should through out a number we are comfortable with and
when the stock comes down hard, it will take the number out (10K shares a $9
is what he recommends).  He also believes it will be a short-lived hard
drop. Then the stock will spring back up very quickly (I suppose he means to
above book value) and underperform the market for six months.  He thinks
Enron employees who stay on board will be rewarded handsomely..

I have heard that a couple of companies have stopped trading with them, but
I don't know which ones.  I don't think the banks will let the company
totally go down, but I do think they are in for a rough ride over the next
year or so.  The problem is that Enron is such a huge player in the energy
markets that the market is fairly illiquid and inefficient without them.
Therefore, it is in everyone's best interest (including the banks and
counterparties) for Enron to make it out of this.

Beginning to get real nervous about the big E.  It's below book value now
and there is no bounce in sight.  I can't imagine what kind of interest rate
a
bank would slap on Enron right now in their dire situation for money.
