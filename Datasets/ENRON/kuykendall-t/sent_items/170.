hey ken -- looking forward to meeting with randy tonight (he probably told you already) -- i know he's talked to some other people that he hasn't been too impressed with -- do you know if there is anything special that he's looking for -- or i should say -- anything that specifically rubs him the wrong way -- my only bonding experience with him has been making fun of janie at parties!!
