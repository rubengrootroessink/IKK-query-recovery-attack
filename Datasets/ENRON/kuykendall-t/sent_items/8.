Subject: Bunko Christmas Party


The two dates to choose from are December 7 and December 14 both on Fridays due to company Christmas party conflicts. 

We have decided to do it at two houses with heavy hors 'd vours, dessert and drinks.  The progressive dinner format takes too long and this will allow us to actually play   with our husbands. 

Please Email me your date preference and I will get back with you on the date chosen and I will get back to you with all the other details.
