Well now that sucks...make me choose the place.  No bitching allowed then!
ha, ha

I was thinking America's but Jennifer is having lunch there today w/her
Mom.
We can shoot for that another time for sure.

Here are my suggestions:  Mi Luna, Fox Diner, Grotto

All are very good...I lean towards Grotto.  There's my 2 cents.

Let me hear what you all think.

Susan,

Since you want to make the reservations, why don't you go ahead and choose.
Someone else can pick next time and make the reservations.

Hi everyone,

This is a reminder about dinner Wednesday night, November 14th.  Is
everyone
still available?  We should pick a spot and I will make reservations.  I
only ask we don't do BBQ.  I can't get excited about BBQ. ;-)

Thanks!
