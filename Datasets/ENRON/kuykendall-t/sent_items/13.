Subject: Dinner on Friday Night


Hello Friends!

Anyone interested in going to dinner this Friday night?  Ed and I haven't
seen you guys in awhile and with the holidays coming up, it may be January
before we can all get together again.  I am open for suggestions as to where
we go.  Guess it really depends on the number of people we have that can
make it.  However, I was thinking around 7pm as the time.  Momma over here
gets hungry and tired early, so don't want to make it a late night.  :)

Let me know if you are interested in getting together.  Pam feel free to
invite Carla and her husband as I know you mentioned something about that
earlier and Pat and Tori please bring Erin if you want.  We would love to
see her and can go where she will be welcome.

Jennifer
