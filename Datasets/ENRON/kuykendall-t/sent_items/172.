hey - thanks for getting back anyway -- i thought it went pretty well - he said -- let's keep talking -- kevin masek was there too - i stayed for a drink with him after randy left and he thought it went really well.  i had a good time -- seemed like he was trying to be pretty formal though.  i was pretty excited with what he had to say about their plans and i know i would get along well with the people that are there so far.  and, i think i can bring alot to the table for him.  we'll see what happens.  i know he'll tell you everything :).

Sorry I didn't get a chance to talk with you prior to your interview.  I was out
of the office on Wednesday and Thursday.  How did it go?  I would say the main
thing that Randy is looking for is a person that he personally likes and can get
along with.  He would pass on the best trader in the industry if he thought the
guy/girl was a jerk.  Randy is a family man.  He likes people that spend time
with their families (especially with their kids).  Randy is the most honest
person I have ever met.  I would love to work for him!  Good Luck!

Let me know what you thought!

Ken
