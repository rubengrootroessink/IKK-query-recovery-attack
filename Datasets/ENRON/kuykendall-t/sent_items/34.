Tori:  This is really a central issue, but they are asking us for the appropriate curves. I think they have been asked to move some old central deals from WNG Williams to WFSC\Perminan.  My suggestion is:

intraminth Curve  - IF-ELPO/PERMIAN
gas daily curve   -  GDP/ELPO/PERM2.

Let me know what you think.  

Thanks

Anne

I set up the new zone in Global, however before we can move any deals to this location it needs to mapped
to a valid intramonth, long term and gas daily curve. Wes, can you or someone in risk let me know which curves?
Perhaps it can be mapped like some other location that already exists.

Thanks
GG
