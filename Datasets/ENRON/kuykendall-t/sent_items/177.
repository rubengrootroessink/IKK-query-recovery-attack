I just wanted to send a follow-up thank you for dinner the other night.  It was nice to see you again and to hear about the exciting prospects you have at RWE.  I know I would enjoy being a part of your trading team, and I truly believe that I can provide you with a good base a knowledge and a strong desire to continue to grow as a trader within your organization.
