Hey Cathy -- just checking in with you.  It was good to see y'all again, but we'd love to come out to the house sometime in October.  I wanted to see what your Sundays looked like - we are out on the 19-21 but that's all.  Also, do you have contact info for Tom and Nicole?  I'd love to get in touch with both of them.
