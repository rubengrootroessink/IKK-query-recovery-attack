Hey Fritz.  I am going to send you an email that attaches a referral form to your job postings.  In addition, I will also personally tell the hiring manager that I have done this and I can also give him an extra copy of youe resume.  Hopefully we can get something going here....

Tori,

I received your name from Diane Hoyuela. You and I spoke
back in 1999 about the gas industry. I tried briefly back
in 1999 and found few opportunities during de-regulations
first few steps. Well,...I'm trying again. I've been
applying for a few job openings at Enron and was wondering
if you could give me an internal referral. Also, any advice
on landing a position at Enron or in general as a scheduler
or analyst.
Last week I applied for these positions at Enron; gas
scheduler 110360, gas analyst 110247, and book admin.
110129. I have a pretty good understanding of the gas
market.

I've attached my resume for you. Congrats. on the baby!
I'll give you a call this afternoon to follow-up, I know
mornings are your time.
Regards,

Fritz Hiser
