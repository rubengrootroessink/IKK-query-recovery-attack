Okay, here's what you're supposed to do... and try not to be LAME and
   spoil the fun. Just give in. Copy (not forward) this entire e-mail and paste
   it onto a new e-mail that you will send. Change all of the answers so that
   they apply to you. Then, send this to a bunch of people you know
   *INCLUDING* the person who sent it to you. The theory is that you will learn a lot of    little known facts about your friends. It is fun and easy.

   **Remember to send it back to the person who sent it to you.**
