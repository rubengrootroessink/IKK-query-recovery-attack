i'm at a loss on calpine also -- seems like they should be a fairly high debt company with all these power plants they are building -- seems like they could refinance debt at these low interest rates and improve their bottom line -- i dont know - just a thought -- the rest of the ideas you had sound fine to me.

I want to put a stop-loss on MS at 49.  It's support is at 50 and if it
breaks that mark.  It will fall to 45 quickly and possibly down to the 30's.
We can hold if you want to though.  SAP already said they would not let CMRC
go bankrupt.  SAP also indicated CMRC book value to be no less than $4.00.
We should probably just ride this one out.  I have no idea about CPN...

If you bought $1000 worth of Nortel stock one year ago, 
it would now be worth $49. 

If you bought $1000 worth of Budweiser (the beer, not the stock) one
year
ago, drank all the beer, and traded in the cans for the nickel deposit,
you
would have $79. 

My advice to you is to start drinking. Heavily.
