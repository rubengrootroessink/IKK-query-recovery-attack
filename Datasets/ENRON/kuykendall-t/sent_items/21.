Hello Mrs. Kuykendall, hope all is well with you and the baby.  All done with my trip round the world (and got a big boy email account as well now that employers will be looking at it!) and of course i have to go through the dreaded interviewing process to find gainful employment..... just spoke with a head hunter lady who is going to help me find a trading job in gas/power and of course i left her your name as one of my many pristine references.  I left keith's as well.  Hopefully you two are both big swingin' dicks in the industry these days and my potential new employers will swoon over your glowing praise!  For now though i am trapped at my parents' house wasting days doing little other than reading.  Its indian summer here in mass today though so i'm going to get outside before the sun goes down.  Read a couple of good books while i was away, Rich Man Poor Man by Irwin Shaw and Memoirs of a Geisha w! ere both pretty good.  got any recommendations of your own?
