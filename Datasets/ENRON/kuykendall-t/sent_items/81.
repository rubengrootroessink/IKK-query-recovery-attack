indeed i did not enjoy my time in houston but put me in the caboose of the enron express and i think i could put up with it for another year.....  just got off a phone interview with arthur andersen for a commodities analyst positioin in chicago, went pretty well i guess.  I also have head hunters trying to get me into AEP and a friend at Aquila trying to backdoor me at that joint.  i could be moving my shit just about anywhere in the next few weeks.
