advice -- any trips you want to take - do it now - start saving a bunch of money - and just remember -- when you start trying - it could happen on the first try!!!

I'm happy to hear that your chances to stay on are good, but like you said
it never hurts to explore the outside world.  Things are going pretty well
for me, I'm actually on my week off from work.  I'm still working on the
Real Time desk, I really enjoy it.  The shift work doesn't bother me, I only
end up working about 12 days a month so there is plenty of free time.
Stacey is no longer with Bristol Myers.  She and one of her co-workers
wanted to job share, but the company denied them, so she is working part
time as a nurse.  It's pretty cool, she gets to set her own schedule and she
only works twice, sometimes three days a week.  Our goal was to get her on a
part time position.  We are ready to have a little bundle of joy ourselves,
I think we are going to start trying in May.  Any advice?  Keep me posted on
what happens at Enron.

Take care.

Scotty

tired 90% of the time -- enron is actually okay -- i feel good about my

something incredible out there that i am missing out on.  what's new

She is a very cute baby!

How are you doing?  What's the latest with Enron?
