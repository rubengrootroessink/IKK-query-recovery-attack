Hello Friends!

I am contemplating having a driveway sale at our house on Saturday Oct 27th
from like 7:30am-1pm.  People get started early at those things and then it
dies off early afternoon.  I don't have a ton of stuff but thought you guys
might have some things you were looking to get rid of.  I only want to keep
it to this small group of people as i think if we get more than this it
would be too confusing.   

I only have 2 conditions:  if you bring stuff over, you must stay to help
out and sell it.  We could do shifts as we won't need everyone there the
whole time.  But everyone would have to be there at first to set up.
Second, all unsold stuff must be taken with you that afternoon.  

It could be somewhat fun, if we make it that way. The sale would be in our
driveway as i don't want stranger hanging out in our garage.  

Let me know if you are interested in participating.  I will let you know if
the response is positive.

Jennifer
