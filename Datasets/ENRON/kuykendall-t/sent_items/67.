I'm coming in on the 15th around 12:30pm and leaving at noon on the 17th.
Let me know if you have time for me (beyotch), just kidding.  I'm playing
golf on Monday and I'm sure I'll be at some broker party on Monday and
Tuesday nights - so if you can get out I would love for you to join me, if
not - that's cool.

I'm staying at the Hyatt, but you can always reach me on my cell:
918.688-4833

Scotty
