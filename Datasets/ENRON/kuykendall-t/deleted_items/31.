hey puddin head, congratulations!  glad to hear
everything went well with the newest kuykendall.  i'm
sure the sleep deprivation will pass... my sis has a 9
month old now and she gets a pretty regular night's
sleep now. are you back at work then?  who has the
baby during the day?  i am now in porto portugal and
if i ever see another glass of port again, i am likely
to vomit.  i hate the stuff anyways but we decided
that since we're here in porto, we gotta drink some
port.  well we spent an afternoon of tasting and the
stuff never did get bearable, even when we were
plastered.  from here i am going to make my way to
ireland to meet up with an old college friend and
maybe even trevor if he should be so lucky.  ok well
glad to hear everything is going well and that you are
back behind the enron locomotive. 

talk to you soon
andrew
tell keith i sez hello too please.
