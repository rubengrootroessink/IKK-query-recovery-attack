FANTASY FOOTBALL MATCHUPS

Every Friday our Fantasy experts break down the key Fantasy
matchup of the week. It may be a top running back facing a
sturdy run defender; a deep-threat wideout matched up with a 
premier cover-corner; or a gunslinging QB against a defense
with ball-hawking safeties. We'll tell you who has the edge.
We'll also highlight the key matchups in every NFL game to 
help you decide who to start and who to bench. Check our 
Fantasy News area (click News, Fantasy News on the toolbar)

THE GRIDIRON GURU

Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions 
about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We 
invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on 
players to: gridguru@commissioner.com. You'll get the chance 
to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like 
yourself! 

Matt Biggins, Los Angeles, CA: Which two receivers should I 
start this weekend: Todd Pinkston, Bill Schroeder, Chris 
Carter, Terry Glenn or James McKnight? Who would you 
recommend starting out of Duce Staley, Stephen Davis, Ron 
Dayne, Kevan Barlow and Jason Brookins?

G.G. - As long as Schroeder (ankle) is healthy, he's a must-
start against a Minnesota defense that allowed Charlie Batch 
to throw for 345 yards and three touchdowns last weekend. 
Miami has a bye, so McKnight is obviously not an option. 
Pinkston and Glenn both have good matchups, but we'd have to 
go with Carter in this case. This season has been very 
unpredictable, so going with your most established player in 
this case is the best move. To answer your second question, 
we'd recommend Davis against a vulnerable Carolina defense 
and Dayne against Philadelphia. It's tough to choose Davis, 
but Barlow has a bye and both Staley and Brookins will be 
splitting carries at best, so our hands are tied. 

Jeff Smith, Tampa, FL: I have Jeff Garcia, who has a bye 
this week. I have the option of starting Jim Miller or 
picking up Chris Weinke. What do you recommend?

G.G. - Miller has been very inconsistent from a Fantasy 
perspective, so we'd have to side with Weinke. He'll be 
facing a Washington defense decimated by injuries and 
vulnerable to players like Muhsin Muhammad, Donald Hayes 
and Wesley Walls. Weinke could have a big game.

Scott Buzby, Newark, DE: Who should I start this week: 
Shannon Sharpe or Bubba Franks?  Also, is it time to drop 
James Thrash? Kevin Johnson, Laveranues Coles, Todd Pinkston 
and Joe Jurevicius are all still available.

G.G. - Franks has been Brett Favre's favorite target in the 
red zone, but Sharpe is one of the best tight ends in the 
league. Sharpe will always give you good production from the 
tight end spot, and we highly doubt that Franks will be able 
to continue to score touchdowns at his current pace of one 
per game. As far as Thrash goes, we feel he's just not good 
enough to be facing No.1 cornerbacks on a weekly basis, so 
his numbers will be inconsistent at best. Your best bet is 
to drop him and go after another No. 1-caliber wideout like 
Johnson, who could emerge as a reliable Fantasy player.

TIP OF THE WEEK

Phil Brown, St. Louis, MO: When will people start giving 
Priest Holmes the credit he deserves? He is the best 
offensive option the Chiefs have, and he even has more 
rushing yards than Marshall Faulk after five weeks. With 
Dick Vermeil calling the shots in Kansas City, Holmes will 
continue to be a productive player all season.
