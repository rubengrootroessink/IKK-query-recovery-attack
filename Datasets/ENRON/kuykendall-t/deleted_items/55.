Hey there,
Thanks for the pics.  What a cutie.  I like the first pic a lot.
I'll IM ya later on this week.  Today I started my first day at the 
Woodlands bakery.  I was up at 4am and literally rolling dough by 5:10.  
Later today I had 2 fillings done and my dentist accidentally anesthisized 
the wrong side of my mouth...TWICE...bc we got to talking about baking and 
the first round of shots wore off....then after the second round he realized 
that he was working on the wrong side.  Not good!  You should tell this to 
Phillip.  We have the same dentist.  It was actually not too bad but I'm 
super groggy.
Hope all is well at work.  I can't believe the stock price.  I almost fell 
over today when I saw it.  Unbelievable.
Take care and I'll talk to you soon.
Mo.
