Yes!

At the time of my last update I had access to the data but was unable to retrieve anything.
This was resolved last week Thursday.  I've put together a project plan and have estimated
dates for each task below.

1.  Identify curves and get your signoff for usability of the numbers (11/20).
2.  Merge curves together (11/21)
3.  Demo a simple spread cacluation off merged curves (11/21)
4.  Demo retrieval of curves for recent days (11/26)
5.  Perform all math needed.  (11/28)
6.  Output the results to HTML (12/5)
7.  Deploy (12/7)

Thanks, 
Kim
