A THANKSGIVING POEM

    TWAS THE NIGHT OF THANKSGIVING, BUT I JUST COULDN'T SLEEP
    I TRIED COUNTING BACKWARDS, I TRIED COUNTING SHEEP.

    THE LEFTOVERS BECKONED -- THE DARK MEAT AND WHITE
    BUT I FOUGHT THE TEMPTATION WITH ALL OF MY MIGHT.

    TOSSING AND TURNING WITH ANTICIPATION,
    THE THOUGHT OF A SNACK BECAME INFATUATION.

    SO I RACED TO THE KITCHEN, FLUNG OPEN THE DOOR
    AND GAZED AT THE FRIDGE FULL OF GOODIES GALORE.

    I GOBBLED UP TURKEY AND BUTTERED POTATOES,
    GREEN BEANS AND CARROTS, STUFFING AND TOMATOES.

    I FELT MYSELF SWELLING SO PLUMP AND SO ROUND,
    'TIL ALL OF A SUDDEN, I ROSE OFF THE GROUND.

    I CRASHED THROUGH THE CEILING, FLOATING INTO THE SKY
    WITH A MOUTHFUL OF PUDDING AND A HANDFUL OF PIE.

    BUT I MANAGED TO YELL AS I SOARED PAST THE TREES ...
    "HAPPY EATING TO ALL - PASS THE CRANBERRIES, PLEASE."

    MAY YOUR STUFFING BE TASTY, MAY YOUR TURKEY BE PLUMP.
    MAY YOUR POTATOES 'N GRAVY NOT HAVE A LUMP.

    MAY YOUR YAMS BE DELICIOUS, MAY YOUR PIES TAKE THE PRIZE
    MAY YOUR THANKSGIVING DINNER STAY OFF OF YOUR THIGHS.


    MAY YOUR THANKSGIVING BE BLESSED!!
