Hi, Tori!

We've improved the Classmates newsletter!

Now the Classmates newsletter is better than ever.
Every issue has a customized listing of all your
friends and classmates who have recently registered
with Classmates. That means finding your friends is
as easy as checking your email. Here's a sneak peek:

Bellaire High School
281 new classmates have joined.
