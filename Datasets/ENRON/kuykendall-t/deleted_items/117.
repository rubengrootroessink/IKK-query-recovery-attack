Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football 
Newsletter! The newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox 
at the end of every week, and will include news about the 
web site; tips on using all the features available; and 
answers to your player-related questions from the "Gridiron 
Guru." 


PLAN FOR THE PLAYOFFS

The Fantasy season is nearing its end, and the playoffs are
on the horizon. For Fantasy 2001 players, the playoffs begin
with NFL week 15 (games of Dec. 22-23) and last two weeks, 
with the championship game in week 16 (games of Dec. 29-30.)

If you're in a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule, 
Playoffs to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds 
they last. Of course, the matchups are probably still not 
determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets. 
The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding 
the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your 
regular season. 

If your team is still in contention, go to 
NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams with byes 
during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be 
available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff 
matchup.


GAME-BY-GAME ANALYSIS

Go to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did
in each game this season. The player's statistics in the 
common categories will be displayed for each game. If you
are breaking down free agents, the game log is great way to
see who's been getting the most consistent production.

THE GRIDIRON GURU

Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions 
about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We 
invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on 
players to: gridguru@commissioner.com. You'll get the chance 
to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like 
yourself! 


Mike Blake: I'm having trouble filling my No. 2 WR spot. 
Should I start Az-Zahir Hakim, Todd Pinkston or Muhsin 
Muhammad in week ten? 

G.G. - Hakim is a hit-or-miss type, so he's risky. Pinkston 
has done nothing in his last four games, and he's losing 
playing time to Freddie Mitchell. Muhammad bounced back from 
a few bad performances to catch six passes for 75 yards last 
weekend against St. Louis, and has had some past success 
against this week's opponent, San Francisco. Go with 
Muhammad. 

Russell Brown: My league starts 2 QBs. Donovan McNabb is one 
of my starters. Who else should I start? I have Tom Brady, 
Vinny Testaverde and Doug Flutie.   

G.G. - Testaverde's Fantasy value has taken a real hit this 
season because of the Jets' conservative offense. Flutie 
struggled last week against a bad Denver secondary, and 
won't have an easier time against Oakland. We'd suggest 
playing Brady, who will start against St. Louis despite the 
return of Drew Bledsoe. Brady has thrown 11 touchdowns in 
his last five games, and is playing too well to bench. 

Chris Gilcrest: Who would you start at QB this weekend: Rich 
Gannon or Kerry Collins? Which one of these four RBs would 
you bench: Eddie George, Michael Pittman, Mike Anderson, 
Curtis Martin?  

G.G. - Collins has the better matchup of the two QBs, but 
he's far too inconsistent to start over a player like 
Gannon. Oakland will be looking to bounce back from a subpar 
performance against Seattle, so look for Gannon to have a 
solid game. As for your second question, bench Mike 
Anderson. You can't bench Martin, no matter how bad the 
matchup may be. George has four touchdowns in his last three 
games against Cincinnati, and is worth starting despite his 
struggles this season; and Pittman's matchup against Detroit 
is too good to ignore.

TIP OF THE WEEK

Keith Simmons, Boulder, CO: Can Terrell Davis ever stay 
healthy? He comes back and teases Fantasy owners with his 
solid play over the last two weeks, only to fall prey to 
another knee injury this past Sunday. He was once the best 
Fantasy player in the league, but now Davis is an 
unreliable, injury-prone shell of his former self.
