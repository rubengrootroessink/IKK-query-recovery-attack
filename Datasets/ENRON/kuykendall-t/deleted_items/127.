Thank you for the beautiful floral arrangment.  It looked sooo nice for our dinner saturday night.  What does your mom think about the merger??  It would be great if she ended up at conoco's office....SHORT DRIVE!!  Hopre your family is well...may you, Pat and Erin have a great holiday!!  I'll try to call your mom later.
