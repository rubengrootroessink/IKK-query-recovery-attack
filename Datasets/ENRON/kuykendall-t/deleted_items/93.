would be a little pissed
AKratish: yes i would be annoyed
AKratish: but i would get over it
littlekitten02: tell him the truth that you had a party to go to 
AKratish: considering my friend had not had a date in a long time
littlekitten02: I just do not understand how you could have over looked that
littlekitten02: ok I really do not understand what you just said
littlekitten02: Yeah I think that it is great that you have a date..
littlekitten02: if anything I told you to go out with him but to use that to
try to make me feel bad is really shity
AKratish: hang on
AKratish: i'm on the phone 
AKratish: ok
littlekitten02: so you know what Alison go if a guy you just met a couole of
hours ago means more than that is fine with me especially since I have never
done that to you 
AKratish: anyway
AKratish: you are absolutely right
AKratish: you have never done that to me
littlekitten02: no you tell me I am right but than you try to make me feel
guilty

littlekitten02: AKratish: considering my friend had not had a date in a long
time

were in that position
