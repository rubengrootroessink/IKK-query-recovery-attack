But what the hell...I enjoy reading them and filling them out so...

Okay, here's what you're supposed to do... and try not to be LAME and
   spoil the fun. Just give in. Copy (not forward) this entire e-mail and paste
   it onto a new e-mail that you will send. Change all of the answers so that
   they apply to you. Then, send this to a bunch of people you know
   *INCLUDING* the person who sent it to you. The theory is that you will learn a lot of    little known facts about your friends. It is fun and easy.

   **Remember to send it back to the person who sent it to you.**
