Golf. Such a small word. Such a big game.

If you're an executive or ever want to be, knowing how to play the game and
talk the talk are careers moves you can't ignore. BusinessWeek Online and 
Golf Digest have teamed up to tell you everything you need to know -- and 
more -- about golf and the executive lifestyle.

We examine where to play, where to entertain, and where to retire. We bring
you golfing stories from the rich and famous.  We explore how golf became the 
executive's favorite obsession in the first place.

Whether you're an executive, a golfer, or all of the above, you'll find
plenty here you won't want to miss. So blast away!
