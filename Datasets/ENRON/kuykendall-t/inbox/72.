It's that time of year again, wanted to get everyone's comments on having a Christmas lunch, with all the women on the west desk.  Dates suggested for having it are December 13 or 14th.  Janie suggested having it at Zulas.  I'd like to get everyone's feedback on having it, the date you like best, and any different restaurant suggestions.  Last year we had a $15 limit on gifts. Also, should we invite Kim Ward and Stephanie Miller, they are part of the west desk.  If I left anyone off the list, please let me know
