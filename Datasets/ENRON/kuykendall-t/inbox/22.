He is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Atlanta, and is expected to start.  If you're desperate for a quarterback, Fiedler's matchup vs. the Falcons is a good one. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=136&key=1069&"><B>Steve McNair</B></A>, QB TEN - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/29/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>
McNair was excused from practice on Friday due to a family illness. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Cleveland, but he's expected to start. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=136&key=188491&"><B>Larry Foster</B></A>, WR DET - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/29/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Foster (thigh) is expected to play in Sunday's game against Chicago. However, he is far too risky to start at this point in the Fantasy season. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=136&key=1186&"><B>Bert Emanuel</B></A>, WR DET - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/29/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>
Emanuel (knee) is expected to play on Sunday against Chicago. However, he's too risky to start at this point in the Fantasy Football season. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=136&key=1203&"><B>Muhsin Muhammad</B></A>, WR CAR - Martin <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/29/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Muhammad (turf toe) will not play this week, and may miss the rest of the season. Isaac Byrd will likely start in his place again. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=136&key=27&"><B> Seahawks</B></A>, DT SEA - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/29/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>
CB Shawn Springs, who was suspended for the past four games, will not start on Sunday against San Diego. He may play a reserve role, however, but his playing time will likely be limited. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=136&key=1871&"><B>Todd Bouman</B></A>, QB MIN - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/29/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Bouman will miss Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a thumb injury. Spergon Wynn will start in his place. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=136&key=187690&"><B>Spergon Wynn</B></A>, QB MIN - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/29/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>
Wynn will start Sunday's game against the Green Bay Packers in place of the injured Todd Bouman. Wynn, who played in most of last week's loss to Jacksonville, is far too inexperienced to start this deep into the Fantasy season. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=136&key=1041&"><B>Drew Bledsoe</B></A>, QB NE - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/29/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>According to published reports, the Chicago Bears are interested in acquiring Bledsoe. With Tom Brady seemingly entrenched as New England's quarterback, it seems that Bledsoe has become expendable to the Patriots. The move would certainly improve the Bears' passing game, but no deals would likely be made until sometime in the spring. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR>

Even if Gramatica can play, he will be a very risky Fantasy starter. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=136&key=1171&"><B>Warrick Dunn</B></A>, RB TB - Martin <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/28/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Dunn's status is day to day with a toe injury. He is expected to play this week, but Mile Alstott has been the most productive back on the team in recent weeks. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR>

Arnold Jackson would replace him as Arizona's third receiver.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=136&key=12366&"><B>Brian Finneran</B></A>, WR ATL - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>
Updated 12/28/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Finneran is listed as probable with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=136&key=1499&"><B>Tyrone Davis</B></A>, TE GB - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/28/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Davis has been elevated to the No. 2 tight end slot over rookie David Martin. He will see a considerable amount of playing time now that he is healthy, because Green Bay employs many double tight end sets in the red zone. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=136&key=1612&"><B>Oronde Gadsden</B></A>, WR MIA - Matty <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/28/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>
Gadsden has been practicing this week and may be able to play. But his hamstring injury may limit his productivity. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=136&key=1069&"><B>Steve McNair</B></A>, QB TEN - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/28/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>McNair was limited in practice on Thursday. He is still expected to play this week, but he is a risky Fantasy starter because he will be less than 100 percent healthy. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=136&key=1236&"><B>Jimmy Smith</B></A>, WR JAC - Frank <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/28/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Smith (flu) has missed practice time this week.

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Brookins has returned to practice and is listed as probable.

, RB ATL - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/28/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Christian is day to day with a calf injury. He is expected to play this week. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=136&key=1440&"><B>Stephen Davis</B></A>, RB WAS - Bass/Hull <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/28/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Davis (knee) has returned to practice.

Bouman took a few snaps Thursday but didn't appear to meet coach Dennis Green's "full strength" criteria for starting against Green Bay.   Spergon Wynn is likely to start Sunday, though coaches didn't discuss the issue after Thursday's practice. Bouman didn't participate in the team's morning walk-through, when players work on plays without fully suiting up. And during the portion of the regular practice that reporters were allowed to watch, Wynn took more snaps than Bouman. A trainer said Wynn continued to take more snaps later in the closed portion of practice.  </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=136&key=1152&"><B>Jerome Bettis</B></A>, RB PIT - Giggles <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/28/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>
Bettis, sidelined by a groin injury, returned to the practice field Thursday for the first time in a month. "Still questionable," coach Bill Cowher said. "He did more today. We'll see how he feels (Friday) and go from there. We'll take it day to day." </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=136&key=1393&"><B>Doug Brien</B></A>, K TB - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/28/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Brien signed a one-year contract Thursday night with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who will use him against Baltimore if Martin Gramatica can't kick this week. Gramatica strained his right hamstring during a 48-21 victory over the Saints last week. Coach Tony Dungy hasn't ruled him out for Saturday night's game against Baltimore, however the club wanted to have a backup plan in case the Pro Bowl kicker isn't ready. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR>
