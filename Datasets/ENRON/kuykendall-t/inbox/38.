Tori,

Just to let you know, I spoke to Victor yesterday and he
tells me they have already filled the two open positions,
but he wants me to forward my resume for future openings. I
am currently revising it and will forward it to him by
tomorrow. 

Thank you for your help and I'll keep trying. If you hear
of anything,...please keep me in mind.

Thanks,
Fritz
