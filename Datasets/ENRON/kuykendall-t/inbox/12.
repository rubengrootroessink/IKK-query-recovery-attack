Dear Amazon.com Customer,

We hope your holiday season was as exciting as ours was... though
we're not through just yet. Join us for our huge Clearance event and

and much, much more.

Plus, if you'd like to clear out some of your own post-holiday
clutter, we've made it easy to sell the used items you no longer
want. Make money in just a few simple steps: you list it, we sell
it, you ship it, and you get paid!

Visit our Clearance event today. With our outlet prices and huge
selection, you can save money and make money on great items in every
