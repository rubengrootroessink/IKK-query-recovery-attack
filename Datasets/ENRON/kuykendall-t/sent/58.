hey there - i was just talking about you with my mom - she said she talked to 
you again today and i was laughing that she's talked to you alot more than i 
have lately!  dinner friday sounds great.  what else have you been up to??  
did you already have the river trip??  we havent been out at all -- just too 
tiring for me to do anything but dinner right now.  we're just trying to get 
everything ready -- it's pretty exhausting.  well - i better get back to work 
-- talk to you soon and see you friday!
