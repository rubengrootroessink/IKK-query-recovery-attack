here are the two new index descriptions that we need:
 
For Socal Ehrenberg --  NGI SoBord Scal Ehr
For Socal Topock --       NGI SoBord Scal Top
 
 
Then, just to clarify on the PG&E Topock product -- here is the special 
language that we need to use -- "The volumes scheduled to be delivered are 
subject to reductions due to normal operational constraints on all 
interconnecting pipelines at this location based upon historical operating 
conditions.  The reductions caused by these are excused nonperformance and 
are not considered a failure to receive or deliver firm gas."
  
We do not want to specifically mention el paso pipeline because the gas can 
come from a variety of different pipelines, all of which can have operational 
constraints.  I think this is close enough to the original language that it 
should not be a problem.  Thanks for your help.
