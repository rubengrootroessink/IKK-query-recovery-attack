I'm so glad you wrote me back - sounds like you're a very busy person, but it 
looks like you're getting to do what you wanted to do.  As for me, I got 
married to a great guy named Patrick that i met during our last semester at 
UT.  We actually got set up on a blind date by Rachel Hanson.  Anyway, we'll 
be married 6 years in June and we're expecting our first child in June.  I 
spent a few years after college as a clothing buyer for Foley's, but I now am 
doing something completely different that I absolutely love.  I work for 
Enron - big energy trading company - wasnt sure if you knew who we were.  I'm 
trading natural gas, and it's a really fun job that's fast-paced and 
challenging.  My hubby is an account manager for an internet company that has 
not yet gone public but their prospects are looking pretty good.  We bought a 
house in Sugarland about 3.5 years ago, but we sold it in August and moved 
into a new house that we built in Katy.  We wanted to be close to my parents 
and also closer to San Antonio - where Pat is from - his parents still live 
there.  Anyway - I guess that's it in a nutshell.  Oh yeah - and my address 
is:
4419 Stackstone Ln.
Katy, TX 77450
I hope we can keep in touch.  I'm not travelling right now, but if you ever 
make it to Houston - I'd love to see you.  Give me some more details in the 
next email!
Take Care and Happy Holidays!
 
 
Love, 
Tori
