injured when their pick-up truck left the road
and<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; struck a tree near Cotton Patch on State
Highway 38 early Monday<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; morning. Woodruff
County deputy Dovey Snyder reported the
accident<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shortly after midnight Monday.
Thurston Poole, 33, of Des Arc and<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Billy Ray
Wallis, 38, of Little Rock are listed in
serious<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; condition at Baptist Medical Center.
The accident occurred as the<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; two men were
returning to Des Arc after a frog gigging trip. On
an<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; overcast Sunday night, Poole's pick-up
truck headlights<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; malfunctioned.&nbsp; The two
men concluded that the headlight fuse on<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the

the bullet, the headlights again<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; began to
operate properly and the two men proceeded on
east-bound<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; toward the White River bridge.
After traveling approximately 20<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; miles and
just before crossing the river, the bullet
apparently<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; overheated, discharged and struck
Poole in the right testicle. The<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vehicle
swerved sharply to the right exiting the pavement
and<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; striking a tree. Poole suffered only minor
cuts and abrasions from<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the accident, but will
require surgery to repair the other wound.<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Wallis sustained a broken clavicle and was treated and
released.<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank God we weren't on that bridge
when Thurston shot his balls<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; off or we might
both be dead" stated Wallis. "I've been a

world, but this is a first for<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me. I can't

Poole's wife, asked how many frogs the boys had
caught<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and did anyone get them from the
truck.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Way to go,
