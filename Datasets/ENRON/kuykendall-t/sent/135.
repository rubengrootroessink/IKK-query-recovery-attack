Hey Sheri.  How's everything going?  Hope you had a good time on your Vegas 
trip.  I haven't even had a chance to talk to Jen about it.  I had a question 
for you -- Do you know of any job openings that would be good for Pat.  I 
have his resume to forward if you think there is anything out there.
