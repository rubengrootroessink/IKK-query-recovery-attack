Tori,

Actually I recognized the name right away...I hear things (infrequently) 
through the grapevine.  I had sent quite a few birthday and Christmas cards 
to your parents' old address (Evelyn Circle--?? or something like that) 
before I heard that they were out in Katy somewhere and that you were back in 
Houston and had gotten married.  I wanted to go to the reunion, but was 
shooting a commercial for something (Subway??---Christie may remember better 
than I do since she wanted me to go with her and I couldn't.)

Good to hear from you!!  I think about you often and still have an old 
picture of you in one of my wallets.  :)

I am currently sitting in a hotel room in Orlando, FL.  I have been here 
working (spokesmodel for IBM and some of it's affiliates) and am very ready 
to fly home tomorrow.  It has not been the best trip I've ever had, but I'm 
sure it's not the worst either.  I now live in Los Angeles about 90% of the 
time and Central Texas about 10% of the time.  Not really enough time in 
Texas for my taste, but that's the way it is for now.  My Dad and Helen 
(wife---wonderful woman) live out near Lake Travis in that house he's had 
since 1991 and Dad and Uncle Van bought the Blanco River Ranch out in Blanco 
County quite a few years ago...so I live at one place or the other when I'm 
in TX.

I guess some things eventually come true...I've been part of the Screen 
Actors Guild for many years now and spend quite a bit of time on the set of 
whatever project is keeping me busy.  I actually have taken a few months off 
lately to recoop from many months of 17-hour days.  I act, model, tutor high 
school kids and assist my boyfriend with his store when I can.

What have you been up to?  Any kiddos yet?  What's your address?  What do you 
do?  Do you ever make it out this way?  I'm sure I have about a billion other 
questions that I could ask to catch up on however many years it's been....

Hope to hear from you soon...

Tell your mom, dad, and Scott that I said hello.  Oh my God!!!  Scott's gotta 
be about 18 by now.  Okay...now I feel old. :)

Love,
Heather

<< I have been wondering for the last couple of months if this is THE Heather
Evans that I was friends with for so long.  So, I am finally writing you an
email.  I know you don't recognize the last name, but, it's me - Tori
(Hatter).  I'd love to know what is going on in your life.  I was hoping
you'd make it to the reunion last year.  Anyway, if you get a chance, drop
me an email - let's catch up.
