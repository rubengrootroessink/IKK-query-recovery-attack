hey martin - i know i havent paid for the fantasy league at all - but i am 
trying to figure out how much i owe - i think 3 of my transactions shouldve 
been free because 1 was to change kickers on the same team and 2 were to 
change my defense on the bye week - so, without any winnings - i think i owe 
$145 - can you verify?  thanks.  also - can you tell me if i won anything for 
making the semi-finals?
