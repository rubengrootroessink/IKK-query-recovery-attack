Have you ever asked your child a question too
many times? I hope you remember my story when they start getting
frustrated! My three year old son had a lot of problemswith
potty training; and I was on him constantly. One day we
stopped at Taco Bell for a quick lunch between errands. It was
very busy, with a full dining room. While enjoying my taco I
smelled something funny, so of course I checked my seven month
old daughter. And she was clean. Then I realized that Matt had not
asked to go potty in a while, so I asked, and he said, "No." I kept
thinking, "Oh Lord, that child has had an accident and I don't have any
clothes with me.
"Then I said, "Matt, are you sure you did not
have an accident?" "No," he replied. I just knew that he must have
had, because the smell was getting worse. So I asked one
more time, "Matt, did you have an accident?" This time he
jumped up, yanked down his pants, bent over and spread h! is
cheeks and yelled "SEE MOM, IT'S JUST FARTS!" While
100 people nearly choked to death on their tacos, he
calmly pulled up his pants and sat down to eat his food as if
nothing had happened. I was mortified but some kind elderly
people made me feel a lot better when they came over and thanked me
for the best laugh they had ever had
