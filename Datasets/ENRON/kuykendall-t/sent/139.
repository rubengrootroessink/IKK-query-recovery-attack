i'm sorry if i am not being understanding about this situation, but i if you 
really look back at the last 5 jobs you've had, i think i have been more than 
understanding about letting you do whatever you wanted to do.  it really 
hurts me that your pride in this situation is more important to you than 
spending time with your pregnant wife and your daughter.  i can't talk to you 
about this anymore if you are unwilling to understand my point of view.  once 
again, if the situation were different, i would tell you to do whatever you 
wanted.  but, this time it's different and i hope you can see that.  i love 
you!
