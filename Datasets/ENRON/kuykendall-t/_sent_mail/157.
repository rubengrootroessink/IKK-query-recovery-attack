we arent busy - looks like jen may be trying to put together a happy 
hour/early dinner for friday - she just sent me an IM - i'm assuming it's not 
in honor of your birthday because it wasnt mentioned.  i wont mention it if 
you dont want me to.  anyway - she did ask about you - said she hadnt talked 
to you in a while.  as far as i know - we have no plans as of yet for the 
whole weekend - i know how much you love football , but maybe we can just 
hang out on sunday and watch the game - make some good food - etc.  by the 
way - i went to the doctor yesterday and he said everything looks perfect 
right now - that was awesome news - i'm going to get an ultrasound sometime 
in the next 2 weeks- hopefully i can find out what i'm having!  i lost my 
waist over the weekend - definitely in the maternity clothes now even though 
they all look huge.  anyway - talk to you soon
