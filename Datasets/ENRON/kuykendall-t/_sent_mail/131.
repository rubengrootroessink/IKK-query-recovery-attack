I'm feeling great - other than not being able to sleep very well - and this 
is just the beginning of that!   Anyway, thanks for forwarding Pat's resume.  
He does like what he is doing there most of the time, but I have been pushing 
for a little more stability from him to take some of the pressure off 
myself.  Thanks again.
