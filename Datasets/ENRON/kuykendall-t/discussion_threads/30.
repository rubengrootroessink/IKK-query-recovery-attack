>Our good buddy Bill Clinton was assigned a new intern named Sally. Being
>the
>polite gentleman he is, Bill went to visit Sally and ask her if she needed
>any questions answered. She said no, so Bill asked, "Have you seen the
>presidential clock yet?"
>
>Sally replied, "I haven't even heard of the presidential clock."
>
>Bill then replied, "Well let's go to my office, so I can show it to you."
>
>Sally was a little taken aback, and she stated, "With all the problems
>you've had lately, I don't think we should."
>
>Then Bill said, "Ahh, it's just a clock and I promise I won't try
>anything."
>
>Sally then agrees to go with him.
>
>Bill leads her to the Oval Office, shuts and locks the door behind them and
>then drops his pants to the floor. Sally is flabbergasted and says, "Mr.
>President, that is the presidential cock, not the presidential clock."
>
>Bill looks at her and says, "Sally, by my definition, if you put two hands
>and a face on it, it's a clock."
