Once Tori is under Dr's care that's when the sick time starts........It could 
be a few days before the delivery depending when the Dr ask the employee to 
stay home, sometimes the don't stay home.  The first day the employee is out 
for delivery or pre-delivery purposes sick time should start.  If the an 
employee has not taken any sick time since January this year they are 
eligible for 4 weeks sick pay at 100% and the following sick days are paid at 
90%.  Until the Dr releases the employee all her time should be
coded sick, once the employee is release she should return to work or make 
other arrangements with HR Rep.

Ben,

Tori Kuykendall will be on maternity leave beginning in June.  How much sick 
time/maternity time can she take before it goes to 90% ?  

Please advise at your earliest convenience.

Many thanks,
Ina Rangel
