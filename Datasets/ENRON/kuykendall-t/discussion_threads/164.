hey andrew -- just seeing how things were going with you.  i was at dinner 
the other night with jojo and your name came up, so i thought i would drop 
you a note.  where are you these days??  things are pretty much the same 
around here -- trevor is planning a trip to come see me when the baby is born 
-- only 3.5 weeks til d-day -- maybe a little earlier if i'm lucky.  wasnt 
sure if i told you that i'm having a little girl -- she wont be spoiled or 
anything.   overall i have to say that pregnancy hasnt been that bad of an 
experience -- other than the lack of partying which in my case is probably a 
good thing.  keith holst was asking about you -- said to tell you hi -- so 
"hi".  thats all from h-town for now.  hope you're doing well.
