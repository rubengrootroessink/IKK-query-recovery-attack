Thirsty Cowboys:

Two cowboys from Texas walk into a roadhouse to wash the trail dust from 
their throats. They stand at the bar, drinking their beers and talking 
quietly about cattle prices.

Suddenly a woman at a table behind them, who had been eating a sandwich, 
begins to cough. After a minute or so it becomes apparent that she is in real 
distress, and the cowboys turn to look at her.

"Kin ya swaller? asks one of the cowboys.

No, the woman shakes her head.

"Kin ya breathe?" asks the other.

The woman, beginning to turn a bit blue, shakes her head No again. The first 
cowboy walks over to her, lifts up the back of her skirt, yanks down her 
panties, and slowly runs his tongue from the back of her thigh up to the 
small of her back.

This shocks the woman to a violent spasm, the obstruction flies out of her 
mouth, and she begins to breathe again.

The cowboy walks back over to the bar and takes a drink of his beer. His 
partner says, "Ya know, I'd heard of that there Hind Lick Maneuver, but, I 
never seen anybody do it."
