Subject: product description change

We would like to begin trading a new product on EOL.  The location - PG&E 
Topock -  has already been set up, but we would like to make a small change 
to the long description.  The line which reads  -  "The transaction is for 
delivery at PG&E, El Paso."  should be changed to "The transaction is for 
delivery at PG&E Topock"    Please let me know when we can review the change, 
as Mike Grigsby would like to begin trading this product as soon as 
possible.  Thanks.
