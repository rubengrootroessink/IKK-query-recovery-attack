Hey! Wow an expectant mother. Im still the consummate bachelor, but I guess
eventually I will fall off the wagon :) Who knows what will happen, right?.
Im excited for you. It was great to hear from you and see you at the
reunion, and I apologize for not contacting you sooner. Actually I told
Geoff to contact you through Rachel, but I guess that situation went south,
along with my plan! Anyway, it sounds as if things are really going well for
you and I am gratified to hear it.
 I actually last heard from Heather a while back. She kills me. I wont hear
anything and then ill get a card or letter or something. I assume she is
still in LA. She gave me all her addresses et cetera but I lost them when I
moved. I suppose I could pull up her driver's license and get her mailing
address.
 I will probably get to Houston some time in the near future. My mom came up
here for Xmas so I havent been down since October. With weekends off now
though it will be easier for me to go visit.Id love to see you. Send me back
an email when you can.

 Robert
