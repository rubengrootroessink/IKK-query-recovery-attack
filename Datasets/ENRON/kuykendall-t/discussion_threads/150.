Tori,

What we'll have to do is to move those products which are in the restricted 
product types to the regular product types.  Then I will set the restricted 
product types to archived. We will need to coordinate as to when you want to 
do this.

Thanks,

Melba

hey melba -- guess what -- we have come to the point where we no longer need 
to make blanco a restricted product.  can we go ahead and change these ep 
blanco avg products - both the fixed and index - back to normal unrestricted 
products?  let me know...
