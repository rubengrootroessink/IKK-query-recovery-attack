just got your email address from rachel.  congrats on your promotion.  i'm 
sure it's going to be alot different for you but it sounds like a great 
deal.  my hubby and i moved out to katy a few months ago.  i love it there - 
my parents live about 10 minutes away.  new news from me - i'm having a baby 
- due in june.  i can't even believe it myself.  the thought of me being a 
mother is downright scary but i figure since i'm almost 30, i probably need 
to start growing up.  i'm really excited though.  rachel is coming to visit 
me in a couple of weeks.  you planning on coming in for any of the rodeo 
stuff?  you'll never guess who i got in touch with about a month ago.  it was 
the weirdest thing - heather evans.  i hadn't talked to her in about 10 
years.  seems like she's doing well but i can never really tell with her.  
anyway, i'll let you go.  gotta get back to work.  looking forward to hearing 
back from ya.
