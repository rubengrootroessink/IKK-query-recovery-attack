<html><div style='background-color:'><DIV>Hello Mrs. Kuykendall, hope all is well with you and the baby.&nbsp; All done with my trip round the world (and got a big boy email account as well now that employers will be looking at it!) and of course i have to go through the dreaded interviewing process to find gainful employment..... just spoke with a head hunter lady who is going to help me find a trading job in gas/power and of course i left her your name as one of my many pristine references.&nbsp; I left keith's as well.&nbsp; Hopefully you two are both big swingin' dicks in the industry these days and my potential new employers will swoon over your glowing praise!&nbsp; For now though i am trapped at my parents' house wasting days doing little other than reading.&nbsp; Its indian summer here in mass today though so i'm going to get outside before the sun goes down.&nbsp; Read a couple of good books while i was away, Rich Man Poor Man by Irwin Shaw and Memoirs of a Geisha w!
ere both pretty good.&nbsp; got any recommendations of your own?</DIV>
