Hey Cathy -- just checking in with you.  It was good to see y'all again,
but we'd love to come out to the house sometime in October.  I wanted to
see what your Sundays looked like - we are out on the 19-21 but that's
all.  Also, do you have contact info for Tom and Nicole?  I'd love to
get in touch with both of them.
