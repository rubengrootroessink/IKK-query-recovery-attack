A fire fighter is working on the engine outside the
station when he notices a little girl next door in a
little red
wagon with little ladders hung off of the side and a
garden hose
tightly coiled in the middle.

The girl is wearing a fire-fighter's helmet and has
the wagon tied to a dog and a cat.

The fire fighter walks over to take a closer look.
"That sure is a nice fire truck," the fire fighter
says, with
admiration.

"Thanks," the little girl says.

The fire fighter looks a little closer and notices
the girl has tied the wagon to the dog's collar and
to the cat's
testicles.

"Little partner" the fire fighter says, "I don't
want to tell you how to run your fire truck, but if
you were to tie
that
rope around the cat's collar, I think you could go
faster."

The little girl says, "You're probably right, but
then I wouldn't
have a siren.
