Yes - since Corestaff is who she would have gotten the pay check from she should definately contact them.  Let me know what they tell her. 
 
Thanks

Christina has not been paid yet.  Should I have her contact Corestaff?

Invoices should be processed as normal.  I have given the invoice to CSS. (our outsource service provider for contract labor) This invoice should be processed through CSS.

Note: Enron is not allowed to issue checks for pre-petition invoices. 

Thanks, 
Ron

Just wanted to follow up on the Corestaff Invoice I faxed over to you on the 17th.  What is the procedure now for such payments?
