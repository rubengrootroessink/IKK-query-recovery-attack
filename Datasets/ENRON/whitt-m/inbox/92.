>  >> Dear Mr. Abby:
>  >> Q: My husband continually asks me to perform oral

>  >> on him.
>  >> A: Do it. Sperm can help you lose weight and

>  >> Dear Mr. Abby:

>Remember,

>The

>  >> Dear Mr. Abby:
>  >> Q: My husband doesn't know where my clitoris is.
>  >> A: Your clitoris is of no concern to your husband.

>  > > Dear Mr. Abby:
