America's Tragedy: TLU Responds

 

Alumni Reports - On behalf of TLU and its alumni, staff members have been calling and sending e-mail messages to alumni and friends of TLU who live in New York City and the District of Columbia or who grew up in these regions. As of today, Friday, Sept. 27, we have not heard of any deaths or missing people among those whom we have attempted to call.

 If you hear word of alumni, friends or other members of the TLU community who have been affected by the Sept. 11 tragedy, please e-mail alumni@tlu.edu <mailto:alumni@tlu.edu> or call 830-372-8020 so that we can send cards and spread the word to alumni and the campus. Thank you.

 First-hand Account - Douglas Rosa, 88G, works as the vice president in the Controller's Division of Deutsche Bank, Manhattan branch. The bank's offices are located some 150 feet from the World Trade Center in downtown NYC. Rosa and his family are shaken, but fine. A first-hand account of Rosa's experience on Sept. 11 follows.

 Having worked some 150 feet from the World Trade Center Tower 2, Sept. 11, 2001 was a day unlike any other in my life. I arrived at work approximately 6:20 a.m. and before entering my Deutsche Bank building at 130 Liberty St. (on the south side of the WTC #2 Tower and connected by a walking bridge), I purchased a package of six apple cider donuts from the Farmers Market that, just like any other Tuesday or Thursday, was setting up shop outside WTC #5.

 At approximately 8:50 a.m., I called my wife, Dorothy, home in Caldwell, NJ, from my office on the east side of the 21st floor, to tell her that our building just shook and that there was a large noise - as if a plane had crashed some place near by. 

 After hanging up, I was told a plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. I looked out my window and saw people running for their lives. There were cars on fire and debris flying everywhere. Our building was getting hit with pieces of the debris, and it sounded like a major hailstorm. We could see this remarkable amount of flame and smoke coming from the hole in Tower 1. I screamed to my co-workers to get away from the windows. At that point, many of us gathered our bags, and began walking down the stairs. As we reached the 7th floor, an announcement was made to stay on our floors, not to evacuate. Knowing that it looked pretty dangerous outside, we went back to floor 21. 

 Then another crash came, bigger than the first one. Someone began screaming, "Run, it's coming down."  We all ran to the south side of the floor and waited for the next announcement. When it was finally made, they began evacuating floors 1-7. We waited some more. Everyone was shaking from nervousness. 

 Then they announced that everyone (all 41 floors) should evacuate as soon as possible and to use the elevator if needed. We began our descent quickly and orderly.

 As we reached the second floor lobby, we were told to exit the building and head south. And so we did. I headed 10 blocks south to Battery Park and began looking for ways to travel back to New Jersey. People told us that the ferries were still leaving from the World Financial Center, directly west from the WTC, so a co-worker and I began walking north along the Hudson River walkway, through Battery Park. As we approached the ferry dock, everyone around just screamed and began running for cover. I ran straight for the Hudson River and never looked back.

  I jumped over the barrier wall and stood there watching as this mushroom cloud of dust kept chasing me. I decided in my own mind to jump in the water if it reached me. Finally, though, it just stopped coming. Needless to say, the ferry never reached the dock. Tower 2 had fallen, and most of us never even realized that it was no longer up there somewhere behind the smoke and dust. Then the radio confirmed it, and we also heard about the attack on the Pentagon.

 Feverishly, the police directed us further north. As we continued on the sidewalk surrounded by all-glass towers, we were all very nervous. People listened on their walkmans and desperately tried to use their cell phones to reach loved ones. I stopped for an instant to lead a blind woman with a young girl to a policeman. 

 Although everyone was nervous, most people kept walking in an orderly fashion without pushing. We continued up the West Side Highway when, suddenly, the Tower 1 gave way. I turned to watch, but quickly turned away and walked even faster. People dropped to their knees to pray. Eventually, I reached another ferry terminal. I waited an hour and a half in line and borrowed several cell phones to call my wife. I never got through to her until I reached New Jersey, though.

  Before I got home that night, I walked and ran a lot more. I even found myself in the middle of a bomb scare inside the Hoboken Train Terminal. I ran to Jersey City and spent the late afternoon hours with my cousin, Sr. Lilian Silkowski, a Roman Catholic nun that lives in Jersey City. I was told that two of her students, siblings, in the parish's high school had lost both their mom and dad. That's when it hit me how many lives had been affected. The parents worked in the upper floors of the WTC. Several other students have been taken out of school because their parents were employed in the WTC and have since lost their jobs, and they can no longer afford the tuition.

When I arrived home at 8 p.m. that evening, I kissed my wife and my kids. I thanked God for getting me home safe. 

 As I watch TV, I realize how much danger I was in and thank God for looking after me. The experience has reminded me of all my friends and family. Although we don't always talk, we are connected. Among them are many of my TLU family. My wife and I have been getting phone calls from all of you. From Texas to Chicago to Phoenix to Connecticut to Virginia and South Carolina. Thank you to Gary, Angelique, Kim, Steve, Debbie, Becky, Chris, Mike, Andrew, Shirley, Charlie, Lana, Kim, Alex, Kris, etc. You are my family. It's nice to be able to say that your phone is "ringing over" from love and support. Thank you all for your prayers and thoughts. I truly believe that they made the difference for me that day.

 For those TLU alumni that are looking for ways to help, may I suggest the following. The families in my cousin's school listed above have many challenges ahead. The school has begun a fund for the two siblings who lost both parents, and the address is as follows: St. Mary's High School WTF Fund, 209 Third St., Jersey City, NJ 07302 attn. Sr. Jacqueline Carey.

 God bless the TLU family and God bless America.

Alumni Event Reports

 

Women of TLU Reports 

 

San Antonio Women of TLU- The San Antonio Women of TLU met Sept. 8 at the San Antonio Country Club to discuss "Kneading the Dough: Women, Faith, and Financial Resources." Dr. Annette Citzler, professor of economics and business administration, was the guest speaker. This event went very well, with approximately 30 women in attendance. Citzler discussed how and why women tend to be more averse to risk and how to move into the future with a better understanding of our finances. 

 

Dallas/Fort Worth Women of TLU - The Dallas/Fort Worth Women of TLU held their founding meeting Sept. 22 at the home of Marion Brekken, wife of Board of Regent Dr. Alvin Brekken. This Women of TLU brunch, at which President Jon N. Moline spoke, was a great success! There were about 30 women in attendance, and since this was their first meeting, there was a great amount of discussion and many ideas were brought up for future meetings. All the Dallas/Fort Worth-area women are excited to have this group in their area and look forward to their next meeting in the spring.

 

Houston Women of TLU - The Houston Women of TLU will meet at 1 p.m. Friday, Oct. 5, for a tour of Rienzi, the former home of Carroll and Harris Masterson.

Austin Women of TLU - The Austin Women of TLU will meet at 10 a.m. Saturday, Oct. 6, at the Lakewood Club House. Speaker Ramona Magid from Komen Austin will lead discussion on the topic "Breast Cancer: Helping Yourself, Helping Others."

 

Seguin-New Braunfels Women of TLU - If you are a member of the Seguin-New Braunfels Women of TLU organization, please note that the program for the Oct. 6 event has changed.

The alums - Virginia Woods, 58G; Betty Jean Jones, 46G; Patt Linden, 60G; plus others - will be joined by a current TLU student. They will each give brief presentations of their own memories of times when America has been vulnerable - Pearl Harbor, the Cuban Missile Crisis, Vietnam, Korea and Oklahoma City - before opening the event up to general discussion with everyone in attendance. 

 

Our apologies about the change in program. We will be working to personally contact those of you who have RSVP'd over the next few days to talk to you about the change. The brunch will still begin at 10 a.m. Saturday, Oct. 6, in the Timmerman Room of Hein Dining Hall on campus.

On Campus

 

U.S. News Rankings - Texas Lutheran University has again been listed in this year's U.S. News & World Report college rankings as one of the best comprehensive colleges and the No. 1 value among comprehensive colleges in the Western United States. Among comprehensive undergraduate colleges in the Western United States, TLU was ranked third in overall quality and the No. 1 value. TLU is the highest-rated Texas college in its category. U.S. News has repeatedly recognized TLU as a top quality institution since the magazine began its rankings in 1983.

 This is the second year in a row TLU has been ranked No. 1 for value, posting numbers showing that 61 percent of its students receive grants based on need, with an average discount of 39 percent.

 A complete account of TLU's placement in the U.S. News & World Report rankings is in the Fall Torch, due in your mailbox in October.

 

Cultural Events Calendar - A vocal performance by a stellar soprano, an art exhibit featuring the works of four international women artists, the traditional Christmas Vespers, and a look at "Scary Frontal Freakin' Skullheads" are some of the highlights of the 2001-2002 cultural events calendar at Texas Lutheran University.

 A calendar of events has been sent to people on the university's arts mailing list. If you would like to receive a calendar, please call the TLU University Relations Office at 830-372-8020. To view it online, please click here:

 <http://www.tlu.edu/> and look under the "Other Updates" section for more information.

Enrollment Up - With official class rosters complete, Texas Lutheran University registered a total student enrollment of 1,473 for the 2001 fall semester. This growth continues a trend of increased enrollment at Texas Lutheran, which has grown steadily since the mid-1990s.

 Numbers show a record main-campus enrollment for TLU, with 1,358 students enrolled in courses on the main campus. Also, 1,257 of those students are full time enrollees - another record for the university.

 The university has set a strategic planning goal of 1,600 full-time students on the main Seguin campus. This number will preserve the university's community feeling, and allow for the small classes and personal attention that are the hallmark of a TLU education.

 This year's average class size is 21, and TLU maintains a 15.5 to 1 student/faculty ratio.

             Other details about the current TLU student body at the main campus:

?        92 percent us hail from Texas, though there are representatives from 25 other states and 16 countries, notably Minnesota and Arizona, as well as Japan and Macedonia.

?        A slight majority - just over 500 individuals - is majoring in disciplines in the TLU College of Professional Studies (business administration, education, kinesiology and social work). 

?        Traditional liberal arts majors offered in the College of Arts Humanities and Social Science (art, English studies, psychology, sociology, etc.) come in a close second, with 416 students majoring in those areas.

?        Almost 300 students have selected majors in the College of Natural Science and Mathematics (biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, physics etc.), and just over 200 are undecided.
