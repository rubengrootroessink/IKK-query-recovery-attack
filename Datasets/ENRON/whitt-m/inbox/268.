Mark - attached are the PUC's proposed rules on hedging - all they did is modify the existing rules pertaining to CGA proceedings.  I'd like to get xcel's comments and did not locate a phone number for their regulatory person in any of their filings that I could locate online.  How about trying to get a copy of their most recent comments from your contact at the company?
