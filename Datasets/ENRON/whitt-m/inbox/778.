Dear MARK:

On behalf of the WHO'S WHO Historical Society, I am pleased to inform
you that you have been selected as a possible candidate for
the 2001/2002 edition of International WHO'S WHO of Professionals.
This is the definitive work on the world's leaders in commerce, economics,
policy, and trade.  In today's difficult economy admission to a powerful
network of professionals can be a career lifeline.
We do require additional information and ask that you complete the data
form via the Internet at http://www.internationalwhoswho.com/fax/5166.htm


There is no fee associated with your listing in WHO'S WHO, and we do not
distribute member information for resale.   Our goal is to provide
reference information and a networking forum for world leaders.

Nomination to WHO'S WHO is an honor in itself.  The Society was founded
in 1928 and provides the most comprehensive listing of professionals whose
contributions shape and direct the destiny of nations.  Our
unabbreviated biographies, of the most successful professionals from 150
countries, are housed in private libraries and collections around the
world.

Current members who grace our pages include leading business executives,
heads of state, noted academics and other professionals.

Our editorial deadline is quickly approaching.  I urge you to act today.
If you delay, I cannot guarantee the committee will have ample time to
review your submission.

Sincerely,

Terrence J. Leifheit
Executive Director

PS:  Please be sure to fill in the fax and e-mail sections so we can get
proofs of your biographical write-up to you quickly if you are selected
for inclusion.
