Barry,

The Jackson Hole Lodging (Huff House) for Mark and Paul was all charged on Mark's card.  The way the lodging was broken up is as follows: 2 rooms, 2 night stay, $215.00 per night per room + 6% tax.  So, actual charges for Mark Whitt was $455.80, and for Paul Lucci was $455.80, for a grand total of $911.60.  

Paul has not given me his receipts from this trip just yet, but the only major travel associated charges he should have to expense would be airfare, which was $251.50. As Mark also had the rental car charged to his expenses.

Please let me know if you need anything further on this, or if you have questions.

Thanks,
Heidi

Heidi, Please sum up my costs and Paul's cost for this trip and forward to Barry.

Barry,  All of the Hotel costs were on my credit card, so all Paul should have is his airfare and incidentals.  But we will sum it up for you.

Mark, I have approved this expense report.. With regards to the Wyoming Gas Fair.  What is the total cost of that trip for you,looks like $ 3,000 or so including airfare, hotel and ancillaries, also ( I believe Paul was there ).  What are his expenses going to be for this? 

Thanks. BT
