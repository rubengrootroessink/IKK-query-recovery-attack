Energy legislation that is helpful to our industry still has a chance of be=
coming law in this session of congress.  IPAMS needs your participation in =
contacting members of congress to voice your support for H.R. 4.  Read Belo=
w for further details.
Although energy legislation appeared dead in this session of congress, Cong=
ressman Nethercutt (R-WA) is seeking support for passing H.R. 4 as a Depart=
ment of Defense appropriations measure.  According to the Congressman, by p=
lacing H.R. 4 in an appropriations measure, it will force bicameral confere=
nce on the issue.   However, the Congressman needs our support in order to =
succeed.
I am trying to get an electronic version of the communication which was fax=
ed to IPAMS, in order to post it on our website.  Regardless we need fast a=
ction by email to support this measure.  In response I have drafted a simpl=
e letter for IPAMS members to email to all congressman on the appropriation=
s committee.  The text of that letter and the email addresses of the House =
Appropriations Committee members  Send one on behalf of your company, all e=
mployees who are willing to participate, your parents, children, grandparen=
ts, etc.  But let?s get the word out.  And please pass this along to anyone=
 who may be interested in supporting energy legislation.  Read below for in=
structions on getting the word out=20
For those of you who are not familiar with H.R. 4 I have attached a copy.  =
Please read.  It is not 100% perfect but it addresses many issues facing IP=
AMS members. =20
