Good morning!  You must be having another excitement-filled day?  Sorry 
about the parking tickets...found them this morning on the floor of my car.  
Maybe they were stuck to my clothes?  I just want you to know I'm ready to 
come back as soon as the agency gets their shit together.  Come on 
Enron...KEEP ON KEEPING ON!!!!!!  Have a good day.  - Christina
