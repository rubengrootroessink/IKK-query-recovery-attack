The George Carlin one I was talking about was the one about things to think 
about like Americans have more money than ever but are unhappy as ever....... 
 Bla bla bla.

I have to take Brock to his well ness visit @ 4p and wont get home till 6ish 
so I will probably just make a salad tonight if that's OK.

Love ya
