Thanks..

We should know something about the well we are currently reentering next week.  Timing on the gathering line is still uncertain.

These are draft versions of the interruptible purchase agreement and
confirm for your gas into Fort Union.  Think about what you what to do
for term, volume etc.  We will then add in the gathering charges.  We
are pretty flexible, so let me know what works for Patina.

Thanks,

Mark
