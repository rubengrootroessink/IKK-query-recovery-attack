> 	Brian Hester invited his mother over for dinner.  During the course
> of the meal, Brian's mother couldn't help but keep noticing how beautiful
> Brian's roommate, Stephanie, was. Mrs. Hester had long been suspicious of
> a relationship between Brian and his roommate, Stephanie, and this had
> only made her more curious. Over the course of the evening, while watching
> the two react, Mrs. Hester started to wonder if there was more between
> Brian and his roommate, Stephanie, than met the eye.
> 
> 	Reading his mom's thoughts, Brian volunteered, "I know what you must
> be thinking, but I assure you Stephanie and I are just roommates."
> 
> 	About a week later, Stephanie came to Brian saying, "Ever since your
> 	mother came to dinner, I've been unable to find the beautiful silver
> gravy
> 	ladle.  You don't suppose she took it, do you?" Brian said, "Well, I
> doubt it,
> 	but I'll send her an e-mail just to be sure."
> 
> 	So he sat down and wrote "Dear Mother, I'm not saying that you 'did'
> take
> 	the gravy ladle from the house, I'm not saying that you 'did not'
> take
> 	the gravy ladle.  But the fact remains that one has been missing
> ever since you were here for dinner". Love, Brian
> 
> 	Several days later, Brian received a letter from his mother that
> read:
> 
> 	"Dear son, I'm not saying that you 'do' sleep with Stephanie, and
> I'm not
> 	saying that you 'do not' sleep with Stephanie. But the fact remains
> that if she was sleeping in her own bed, she would have found the gravy
