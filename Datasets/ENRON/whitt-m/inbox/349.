Barry's Assistant in Houston is requesting I get your vacation days to her ASAP -- If you can get you time to me prior to the 25th, that would be great!

Thanks,
Heidi

Please put together your vacation schedules for the rest of the year and forward to Heidi by 10/25/01.

Heidi, please organize these into one summary and let me see them before they go to Barry.
