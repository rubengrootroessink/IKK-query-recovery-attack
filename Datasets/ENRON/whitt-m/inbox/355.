The George Carlin one I was talking about was the one about things to think about like Americans have more money than ever but are unhappy as ever.......  Bla bla bla. 

I have to take Brock to his well ness visit @ 4p and wont get home till 6ish so I will probably just make a salad tonight if that's OK. 

Love ya
