This is worth considering. Let's all be careful!=20


Hi All -=20

I think you all know that I don't send out hoaxes and don't do the=20
reactionary thing and send out just anything that crosses my path.  This on=
e,=20
however, is a friend of a friend and I've given it enough credibility in my=
=20
mind that I'm writing it up and sending it out to all of you.=20

My friend's friend was dating a guy from Afghanistan up until a month ago.=
=20
She had a date with him around 9/6 and was stood up. She was understandably=
=20
upset and went to his home to find it completely emptied.=20

On 9/10, she received a letter from her boyfriend explaining that he wished=
=20
he could tell her why he had left and that he was sorry it had to be like=
=20
that. The part worth mentioning is that he BEGGED her not to get on any=20
commercial airlines on 9/11 and to not to go any malls on Halloween. As=20
soon as everything happened on the 11th, she called the FBI and has since=
=20
turned over the letter.=20

This is not an email that I've received and decided to pass on.  This came=
=20
from a phone conversation with a long-time friend of mine last night.=20

I may be wrong, and I hope I am. However, with one of his warnings being=20
correct and devastating, I'm not willing to take the chance on the second=
=20
and wanted to make sure that people I cared about had the same information=
=20
that I did.=20
