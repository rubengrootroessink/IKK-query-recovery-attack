Police arrested Malcolm Davidson, a 27 year old white male, resident of
Wimbledon, in a pumpkin patch at 11:38 pm Friday. Davidson will be
charged with lewd and lascivious behavior, public indecency, and public
intoxication at the County courthouse on Monday.

The suspect allegedly stated that as he was passing a pumpkin patch, he
decided to stop. "You know, a pumpkin is soft and squishy inside, and
there was no one around here for miles. At least I thought there
wasn't," he stated in a phone interview from the County courthouse jail.
Davidson went on to state that he pulled over to the side of the road,
picked out a pumpkin that he felt was appropriate to his purposes, cut a
hole in it and proceeded to satisfy his alleged "need". "I guess I was
just really into it, you know?" he commented with evident embarrassment.


In the process, Davidson apparently failed to notice the Wimbledon
Municipal police car approaching and was unaware of his audience until
officer Brenda Taylor approached him. "It was an unusual situation,
that's for sure," said officer Taylor. "I walked up to (Davidson) and
he's...just working away at this pumpkin." Taylor went on to describe
what happened when she approached Davidson.

"I just went up and said, "Excuse me sir, but do you realize that you
are screwing a pumpkin?" He got real surprised as you'd expect and then
looked me straight in the face and said, 'A pumpkin? Damn... is it
midnight already?"
