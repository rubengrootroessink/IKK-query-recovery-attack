Mark,
Mark,
Hope all is well with you guys in Denver.  
I  hope you are able to continue to make deals and are not caught up in the unbelievable craziness here in Houston.  
I was looking for companies to approach about employment and Burlington Resources name came up.  I assume Lee Hanse is still with them. I was going to send him an e-mail with my resume.  Any thoughts about BR.
Thanks,
Andy
