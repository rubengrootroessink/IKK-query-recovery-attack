The convention dates are now January 26-29, 2002.

I'm sending you a new confirmation from the NADA for these dates.  They are using some of the NFL money to refund 100% of the registration fees for the dealers and managers and 50% of the fees for the guests.  Of course I registered everyone before September 11; otherwise I would have registered everyone as managers!  I' m sure that's what everyone will do that registers now.  Who said "the early bird gets the worm?"
