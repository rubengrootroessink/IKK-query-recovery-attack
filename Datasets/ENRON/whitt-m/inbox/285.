Mark, I have reviewed this file and believe it is accurate up to the end of Q3.. Can you please review for your guys and advise if there is any variance.. I am not worried about 10 or 20,000 either way because I don't think we will manage down to that level anyways.

Barry,

Attached is a revised origination schedule for 3rd quarter and supporting detail.

Please provide any revisions by Wednesday, October 31.  I will consolidate the originations for all teams and submit to Louise.

Let me know if you have any questions.

 

Have a Great Day,
