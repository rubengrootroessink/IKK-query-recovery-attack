STAFF-WRITTEN COLUMNS

What's up with the IEEE 1451 standard? 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some years ago we saw the introduction of the IEEE 1451 architecture for smart transducers, which was supposed to make it possible to connect any kind of sensor or actuator to any kind of bus. While the first part of the standard was completed in 1997, the remainder is still under development and getting a lot of attention.
