A man boarded an airplane and took his seat.  As he settled in, he
glanced 
up and saw a very beautiful woman boarding the plane.  He soon realized
she 
was heading straight toward his seat.  Low and behold, she took the seat

right beside his.  Eager to strike up a conversation, he blurted out, 
"Business trip or vacation?"

She turned, smiled and said, "Business.  I'm going to the annual 
Nymphomaniac Convention in Chicago."

He swallowed hard.  Here was the most gorgeous woman he had ever seen 
sitting next to him and she was going to a meeting for nymphomaniacs!  
Struggling to maintain his composure, he calmly asked, "What's your
business 
role at this convention?"

"Lecturer," she responded.  "I use my experience to debunk some of the 
popular myths about sexuality."

"Really, what myths are those?" he asked.

"Well," she explained, "one popular myth is that African American men
are 
the most well endowed, when in fact, it's the Native American Indian who
is 
most likely to possess that trait.  Another popular myth is that French
men 
are the best lovers, when actually it is the men of Jewish descent.  We 
have, however, found that the best potential lover in all categories is
the 
Southern redneck."

The woman started to feel a little uncomfortable and blushed.  "I'm
sorry," 
she said, "I shouldn't really be discussing this with you, I don't even
know 
your name."

"Tonto," the man said.  "Tonto Goldstein, but my friends call me Bubba."
