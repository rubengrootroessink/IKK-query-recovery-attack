The following is a summary of the estimated costs of our buildout/subdivide project:

Blueprints	$6,000
Construction	$70,000
Furniture	$3,000
Voice/Data	$4,000 	
*Commisions	$16,000

*Commisions were negotiated by Enron Realty

We had a profit of roughly $70,000 on the sublease over the term of the lease and will save approximately $11,000 per month on the sublease.
