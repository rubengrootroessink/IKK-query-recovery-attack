Are you sending out Xmas cards.  We usually do, and we usually send a small $25 gift to our best customers (ones we make money off) and those who do operational favors for us.

There is an Enron card but it does not say Enron or we can order some.  Probably $.75 plus postage and 150 cards.  Gifts probably go to 20 customers for a cost of $500 - $600.

What do you think?
