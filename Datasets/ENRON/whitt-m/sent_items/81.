Mark,
 
According to the listing agent, the annual gross income for this unit is $22,800.  This is actual income from the past year. Expect this year to be somewhat less.  Also, a contract has been offered on this property, but not yet accepted.  I'm going over there to take a look today.
 
Randy

Here's one I ran across. Not huge, but great location(walk to the gondola).  VERY rentable.
