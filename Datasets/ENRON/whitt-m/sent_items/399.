Tropical storm Allison did us in. 2 feet of water in the casa. Lost everything except some furniture. Nad's can't make up her freaking mind as to what she wants sooooo, we are moving at a "deliberate" pace. I've reached my "let's make a decision" point a long time ago. We do not like each other anymore, and fight like cats and dogs. I give her until the end of the year before she tells me to hit the road. Without Meaghan I would have been gone long ago. Know anyone who wants to have fun with an old fart? I may be fat and ugly but I have been celibate for THREE YEARS.

I didn't know you were living in an apartment.  When did this happen.  What do you mean repair or rebuild?  I hate to hear about you and Nadine.  That is too bad.  Didn't she know you were a piece of shit when she married you!  I hate that these women forget that we have always been shitty.  
 
The kids are great!  Brock is finally becoming alot more fun.  He and Lauren get along really well.
 
Too hard to tell what will happen with Dynegy.  Not sure I want to work for this new regime.  I guess it all comes down to money.  As always I'm still a whore.

Still living in the apartment, trying to decide what to do with the house (repair or rebuild). Things continue to deteriorate with Nadine. Between you and me I doubt if we'll make it to our 20th anniversary unless it's for Meaghan's sake.
 
How's your clan? Girls driving you nuts?
 
What's your take on what you'll do with the merger or is it too soon to call?
 
Take care, Murph.
