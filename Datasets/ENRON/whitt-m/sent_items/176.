Heidi, Please sum up my costs and Paul's cost for this trip and forward to Barry.

Barry,  All of the Hotel costs were on my credit card, so all Paul should have is his airfare and incidentals.  But we will sum it up for you.

Mark, I have approved this expense report.. With regards to the Wyoming Gas Fair.  What is the total cost of that trip for you,looks like $ 3,000 or so including airfare, hotel and ancillaries, also ( I believe Paul was there ).  What are his expenses going to be for this? 

Thanks. BT
