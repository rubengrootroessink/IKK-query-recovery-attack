Hi Mark~~Is Alicia a strick vegetarian?  I havent picked the menu yet, but here's what I'm thinking:
 
Filet Mignon or Filet Wellington
Some sort of fish--Trout, tuna, king salmon
Rack of Lamb or chx chardonnay
Prime rib or another type of steak
 
If any of these will work let me know.  I can choose 4 dinners.  If she is a strick vege, I will see if I can single order off of their vegetarian meal.
 
Thanks,
Kristen
