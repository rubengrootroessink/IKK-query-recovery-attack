Brian, After talking to our legal department it seems that in order to effectuate the wellhead purchase we will need assignment of the Williams contract instead of being agent.  This is important because we will have title to the gas at Durango.  Therefore we need to have the contract assigned to us.  Can you talk to Williams ASAP and see if that is a problem?

Thanks

Mark
