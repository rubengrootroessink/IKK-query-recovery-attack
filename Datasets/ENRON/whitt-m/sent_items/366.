We have a very good relationship, and long term gas sale with Thermo Partners who manage the 270 MW Ft. Lupton facility.  They have inquired as to Enron's interest in either buying the energy, tolling or buying the entire plant.  The effective date would be July 2002.  The plant is currently under a QF contract with PSCo.

Mike, I would like to see if you have some time on Monday afternoon to discuss the particulars and we can devise a game plan to get you connected with these guys.  Let me know your availability.

Thanks
Mark
