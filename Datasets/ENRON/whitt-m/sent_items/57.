We are at 1200 17th ST. Suite 2750.  The building is the Tabor Center.

Kevin Williams 303-674-9782

Clifford Hickey 303 298- 1000

I will lwt you know if I hear back form them.  But it is a good idea if you give them a call.

You may have seen the Qwest announcements yesterday.  Not good.  7,000 more layoffs.

See you monday.
