Way too close to home!

Male Maturity

When I was 14, I hoped that one day I would have a girlfriend.

When I was 16 I got a girlfriend, but there was no passion. So I decided I
needed a
passionate girl with a zest for life.

In college I dated a passionate girl, but she was too emotional. Everything
was an emergency;
she was a drama queen, cried all the time and threatened suicide.

So I decided I needed a girl with stability.

When I was 25 I found a very stable girl but she was boring. She was
totally
predictable and
never got excited about anything. Life became so dull that I decided that I
needed a girl with some
excitement.

When I was 28 I found an exciting girl, but I couldn't keep up with her.
She
rushed from one
thing to another, never settling on anything. She did mad impetuous things
and made me miserable as often as happy. She was great fun initially and
very energetic, but directionless.

So I decided to find a girl with some real ambition.

When I turned 31, I found a smart ambitious girl with her feet planted
firmly on the
ground and married her.

She was so ambitious that she divorced me and took everything I owned.

Now I am 49 and just looking for a girl with big tits.
