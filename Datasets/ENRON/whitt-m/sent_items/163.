> The paradox of our time in history is that we have taller buildings but

> We buy more, but enjoy less. We have bigger houses and smaller families, 
> more 
> conveniences, but less time. We have more degrees but less sense, more 
> knowledge, but less judgment, more experts, yet more problems, more 
> medicine,

> We drink too much, smoke too much, spend too recklessly, laugh too

> drive too fast, get too angry, stay up too late, get up too tired, read 
> too 
> little, watch TV too much, and pray too seldom. 
> 
> We have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values. We talk too 
> much, 
> love too seldom, and hate too often. We've learned how to make a living, 
> but 
> not a life. We've added years to life not life to years.

> We've been all the way to the moon and back, but have trouble crossing

> We've done larger things, but not better things. We've cleaned up the

> We write more, but learn less. We plan more, but accomplish less. We've

> These are the times of fast foods and slow digestion, big men and small

> quick trips, disposable diapers, throwaway morality, one night stands, 
> overweight bodies, and pills that do everything from cheer, to quiet, to

> Remember, say a kind word to someone who looks up to you in awe, because

> Remember, to say, "I love you" to your partner and your loved ones, but
