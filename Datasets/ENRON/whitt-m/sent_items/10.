I spoke with Jill at the agency, and I will either meet with her later this 
afternoon or tomorrow morning.  She basically just needs some paperwork on 
me and I am then able to start working for you as soon as you'll have me.  
When would you like me to begin?  This week...Thurs?  Just let me know what 
you'd prefer and I'll be there...with bells on!
