The play was great!  Always fun to be the proud father.  We enjoyed having you and would love to do it again.  Stay in touch!

Mark

Mark,

Thanks so much for your kind hospitality.  Please thank Alicia again for me.  
How did Lauren's play go last night?  I am getting more excited about a move 
away from Houston, especially to Denver.  I hope you and your family have a 
great trip and please do give us a call if you swing into Houston.  Talk to 
you soon.

Kind regards,

-Larry-
