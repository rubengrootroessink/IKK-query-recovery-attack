I have been sick all week so it has limited my drinking ability.  Plan on getting lit tonight.  Industry response has been great towards us personally and we have quite a few options.  It is possible that on Monday you will see an announcement on a sale of the trading company, or at least it's employment contracts.  I will let you know what happens.

Are y'all sober yet?

Let me in on what's going on with y'all.

I can see Ken and his boys going to jail. Bend over.

Murph.
