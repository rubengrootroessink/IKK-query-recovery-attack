I had not heard that there was a discussion today. However, since we ran the economics for Huber and discovered that Enron's books do not appropriately value the Permian capacity, we have been trying to convince BP that the value of the capacity is greater than the basis spread becase of the optionality associated with the variable costs of fuel and commodity.  We used to have a model that the transport group used to use to value that optionality based upon the volatility of the basis spreads and the variable costs.  Steph and Phil are running numbers to determine Enron's "extrinsic value".  We need to discuss how and what information we share with BP in order to convince them that the capacity is worth more than the value than that the  outright basis markets .

that was today... I had heard they were sniffing around about optionality values?  

It is not in the agreement. just a question.

We decide to leave out the $ value in order to focus them on the structure.  I do not see the conversation about option values on the pipe?
