> Here is a pretty neat little thing from Paul Harvey.  See if you can guess
> the riddle at the end.
>
> Paul Harvey Writes:
> We tried so hard to make things better for our kids that we made them
worse.
> For my grandchildren, I'd like better.
> I'd really like for them to know about hand me down clothes and homemade
ice
> cream and leftover meat loaf sandwiches.  I really would.
> I hope you learn humility by being humiliated, and that you learn honesty
by
> being cheated.
> I hope you learn to make your own bed and mow the lawn and wash the car.
> And I really hope nobody gives you a brand new car when you are sixteen.
> It will be good if at least one time you can see puppies born and your old
> dog put to sleep.
> I hope you get a black eye fighting for something you believe in.
> I hope you have to share a bedroom with your younger brother/sister. And
> it's all right if you have to draw a line down the middle of the room, but
> when he wants to crawl under the covers with you because he's scared, I
hope
> you let him.
> When you want to see a movie and your little brother/sister wants to tag
> along, I hope you'll let him/her.
> I hope you have to walk uphill to school with your friends and that you
live
> in a town where you can do it safely.
> On rainy days when you have to catch a ride, I hope you don't ask your
> driver to drop you two blocks away so you won't be seen riding with
someone
> as uncool as your Mom.
> If you want a slingshot, I hope your Dad teaches you how to make one
instead
> of buying one.
> I hope you learn to dig in the dirt and read books.
> When you learn to use computers, I hope you also learn to add and subtract
> in your head.
> I hope you get teased by your friends when you have your first crush on a
> boy\girl, and when you talk back to your mother that you learn what ivory
> soap tastes like.
> May you skin your knee climbing a mountain, burn your hand on a stove and
> stick your tongue on a frozen flagpole.
> I don't care if you try a beer once, but I hope you don't like it.  And if
a
> friend offers you dope or a joint, I hope you realize he is not your
friend.
>
> I sure hope you make time to sit on a porch with your Grandma/Grandpa and
go
> fishing with your Uncle.
> May you feel sorrow at a funeral and joy during the holidays.
> I hope your mother punishes you when you throw a baseball through your
> neighbor's window and that she hugs you and kisses you at
Hanukah/Christmas
> time when you give her a plaster mold of your hand. These things I wish
for
> you - tough times and disappointment, hard work and happiness.  To me,
it's
> the only way to appreciate life.
> Written with a pen.  Sealed with a kiss.  I'm here for you.  And if I die
> before you do, I'll go to heaven and wait for you.
> Send this to all of your friends.  We secure our friends, not by accepting
> favors, but by doing them.
>
> Paul Harvey RIDDLE:
> When asked this riddle, 80% of kindergarten kids got the answer, compared
to
> 17% of Stanford University seniors.
> What is greater than God, More evil than the devil, The poor have it, The
> rich need it, And if you eat it, you'll die?
> Send this to 10 people and then press shift and you will get the answer.
> P.S. You won't believe this, but this really does give you the answer!!!!
