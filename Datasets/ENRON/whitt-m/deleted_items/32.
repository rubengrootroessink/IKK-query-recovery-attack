Mark,

I spoke with our ATT Wireless (Cell Phone) rep. yesterday.  I told him about the Sprint packages that offer many more minutes for same $$ as ATT.  He wants to work with us.  He's on family-leave  for the next 2 weeks, but he and I are scheduled to meet the 2nd week of Oct.  He knows we're doing some comparison shopping, and he doesn't want us to leave.  I think it would be in our best interest to see what he can offer us.

I'll keep you posted.
