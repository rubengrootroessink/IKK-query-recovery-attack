Mark,

Doug Fuehne, head of our marketing group will join me in Denver as Tom is unable to attend.  Tom is focused on gathering industry partners to develop a neutral hub for hosting the CommodityLogic modules and counterparties data.  We will arrive late morning of the third and meet you at the Enron office.  Were you able to arrange a meeting with e Prime?
