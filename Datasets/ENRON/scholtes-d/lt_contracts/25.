 In a confirmation letter dated September 27, 2000 we did a five year fixed price deal with LP and, in the confirm, we amended the credit terms of the underlying Enron Master Agreement.  In the confirmation letter we use to document this current deal,  we need to make sure:  (i) Credit is ok with the new deal being done under the same old credit terms; and (ii) that the new confirm refer to the credit amendments in the old confirm.  Melissa and Sharon, please make sure Credit is ok with the old credit amendments for the new deal and then send me the draft confirm and I will make sure it refers to the old confirm correctly. ----cgy

The attached details a sale done late Friday (6/8/01) afternoon to L-P that needs to be entered into the Trade log.  Per Paul Radous the "credit hold" will be less than $1.00/MWh.  Christian Yoder is familiar with the needed confirmation.  If anyone has any questions please let me know Monday (6/11) as I'll be traveling the remainder of the week.  Thanks again for everyone's efforts.  John
