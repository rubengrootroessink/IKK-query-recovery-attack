Stewart,

I highlighted the special conditions section.  I know the special conditions section currently in the confirm is not correct but I am not sure what it needs to be changed to.  I also highlighted the contract name because I don't think a transmission deal can be done under the EEI agreement.

 

Thanks,
Melissa

Please copy Sharen on any e-mail response.  If I am not available she will be finishing this confirm.
