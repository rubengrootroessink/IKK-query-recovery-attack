All,

This morning, I spoke with Chris Mallory, Phil Platter, Diana Scholtes, and=
 Serena Bishop about the deal change mentioned below.  I want to make sure =
everyone is on the same page regarding how the deal change occured and the =
changes we are making to prevent it from happening again.  Since FSP and En=
Power are fully integrated systems, EnPower can add and edit FSP data and F=
SP can add and edit EnPower data.  Presently, when a new schedule is create=
d in FSP Schedule Blotter, the new schedule, related deal, and FSP extensio=
n data are created.  When a schedule is edited in FSP Schedule Blotter, the=
 related deal information is synchronized to match those changes.  Yesterda=
y, during the FSP production parallel, a schedule was zeroed out and the re=
sulting deal synchronization caused the "wierd deal change".  FSP is being =
changed to no longer synchronize deal information of existing deal to match=
 schedule changes made in FSP Schedule Blotter.  No editing of existing dea=
l information (peer, leg or term) will be allowed via the FSP Schedule Blot=
ter.  We have also been asked to review how FSP changes are reflected in th=
e audit tables to make sure they are reflected like the changes from other =
EnPower applications.

Subject:=09Weird Deal Change Yesterday

Something strange happened in Enpower yesterday.  A deal from the STNW book=
 was changed and we aren't sure why.  It appears that some strips from a $1=
80 sale in NP15 were erased.  Our theory is that something happened between=
 FSP and Enpower that erased these strips.  Of course, we don't know what h=
appened, which is why I am contacting you.  This is really scary if our sys=
tems are changing deals.  The only reason that we noticed was because of a =
huge P&L hit to the STNW book.  If the price of the deal had been closer to=
 current market we wouldn't have noticed.  Please look into this and let th=
e trading team know what happened.
