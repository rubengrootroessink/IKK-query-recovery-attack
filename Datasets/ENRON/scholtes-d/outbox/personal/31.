Diana,

It's obvious that I am no longer useful to you besides as a baby sitter.  
There is absolutely no love, respect or feelings for me whatsoever.  I have 
outlived my welcome.  It appears that you have gotten everything you've ever 
wanted and now are discarding me and our relationship.  The horrible thing is 
that I'm not sure how long this has been going on.  It seems that every time 
we have problems, I buy you something new and our relationship miraculously 
heals itself.  I now believe (and have probably always believed) that if I 
wouldn't have decided to build the house, you'd have already left me.  That's 
a shame, because I will never forgive you for allowing me to sell MY home 
(and the girls home) and then discarding our marriage sending me and my 
family out into the streets without the most important material thing 
Jennifer and Lindsay have ever had.

I look back at our 9 years of marriage, especially the last five years and 
the only time I can remember truly being loved and appreciated was when you 
were pregnant with Natalie.  You blame me for not being as good to you as I 
was when you were pregnant, but I say that you were the one who changed after 
you had Natalie.  Not that you weren't that way before you were pregnant, you 
were just different during the pregnancy.

I''ve played this game much too long.  I need to be loved, appreciated and 
respected.  I'm neither of those.  I deserve better and maybe, since you are 
obviously so unhappy, you do too.

I'm positive the effect on Natalie will be devastating.  That's why we have 
decided to drag this out this long.  But our relationship, if you can call it 
that, has degraded to a very low and dangerous point.  That's why I have 
decided to move into an apartment after the girls go home.  I have already 
been looking, I just need to decide where to move.

As for custody, I'm sure we will have differing opinions and we will have to 
discuss them in person.

I would appreciate it if you could make some time over the next couple days 
to discuss with me the timing of my move and discuss how we are going to 
handle it with our parents, friends and mostly the kids.


Bitterly,

Bill Scholtes
