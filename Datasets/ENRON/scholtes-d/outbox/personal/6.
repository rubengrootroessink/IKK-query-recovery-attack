Diana; last week my boss and I met with Sean regarding a position within
PG&E similar to what you're currently doing.  PG&E would be very interested
talking to you but the catch is the job is located in Bethesda Maryland.
Are you at all interested, and secondly would you and Sean consider residing
in Bethesda performing the exact same function you are both performing
today?  The second option is a long shot but I wanted to run it by you.
Hopefully you had a pleasant Holiday.   John
