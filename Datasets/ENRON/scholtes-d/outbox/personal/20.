Rabin & Peckel LLP Commences Class Action Against Enron Corporation and Cer=
tain of Its Officers and Directors, Alleging Violations of Federal Securiti=
es Laws


NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 7, 2001--A class action complaint has been =
filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texa=
s on behalf of all persons or entities who purchased Enron Corporation (``E=
nron'' or the ``Company'') (NYSE: ENE <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=3Dene&d=
=3Dt> - news <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/e/ene.html>) common stock between Janu=
ary 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, inclusive (the ``Class Period''). The co=
mplaint was brought against defendants Enron, Kenneth Lay, Jeffrey K. Skill=
ing and Andrew Fastow. The case is numbered H-01-3736. The Honorable Melind=
a Harmon is the Judge presiding over the case.=20

The Complaint alleges that defendants violated Section 10(b) and 20(a) of t=
he Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 by issuing a series of material misr=
epresentations to the market between January 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001,=
 thereby artificially inflating the price of Enron common stock. Specifical=
ly, the Complaint alleges that Enron issued a series of statements concerni=
ng its business, financial results and operations which failed to disclose =
(i) that the Company's Broadband Services Division was experiencing declini=
ng demand for bandwidth and the Company's efforts to create a trading marke=
t for bandwidth were not meeting with success as many of the market partici=
pants were not creditworthy; (ii) that the Company's operating results were=
 materially overstated as a result of the Company failing to timely write-d=
own the value of its investments with certain limited partnerships which we=
re managed by the Company's chief financial officer; and (iii) that Enron w=
as failing to write-down impaired assets on a timely basis in accordance wi=
th Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (``GAAP''). During the Class Pe=
riod, Enron insiders disposed of over $73 million of their personally-held =
Enron common stock to unsuspecting investors.=20

On October 16, 2001, Enron surprised the market by announcing that the Comp=
any was taking non-recurring charges of $1.01 billion after-tax, or ($1.11)=
 loss per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2001, the period ending Se=
ptember 30, 2001. Subsequently, Enron revealed that a material portion of t=
he charge was related to the unwinding of investments with certain limited =
partnerships which were controlled by Enron's chief financial officer and t=
hat the Company would be eliminating more than $1 billion in shareholder eq=
uity as a result of its unwinding of the investments. When this news hit th=
e market, the price of Enron common stock dropped significantly.=20

Plaintiff is represented by the law firm of Rabin & Peckel LLP. Rabin & Pec=
kel LLP and its predecessor firms have devoted its practice to shareholder =
class actions and complex commercial litigation for more than thirty years =
and have recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for shareholders in clas=

, you may, no later than December 21, 2001, move the Court to serve as lead=
 plaintiff. To serve as lead plaintiff, however, you must meet certain lega=
l requirements. You can join this action as a lead plaintiff online at www.=
