THanks for the pics!  They're great...one thing, I can not believe you got
another dog!!  That story still kills me! Glad to hear your house has worked
out so nicely...I trust that you've sold your other house and all is good.
I would love to get together with you anytime soon...if you are not going to
be around here in the near future, I will come there and see you.  I've not
been to your trade floor for years now.  Just let me know when you thought
you might be around here and if not, I'll make arrangements to go down
there.  I hope that you're not in a panic yet...you just never know until
the full shakeout hapens what will take place.

I have forwarded you below a couple of pics of the dogs (my parents-in-law's
dog and my dog, Oakley)  Oakley is the chocolate one. I will be sure to keep
in touch with you and pls do the same.
Cheers! <<17080007.jpg>>  <<17080009.jpg>>
