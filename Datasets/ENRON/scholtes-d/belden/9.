Over the last couple of years we have had numerous social events including holiday parties, company-sponsored outings to Edgefield, post-quarterly meeting outings, and going away parties.  While I hope that people thoroughly enjoy themselves, I ask that you keep in mind that we all have to act professionally and responsibly during and after these events.  I have been working with Chris Calger and Amy Fitzpatrick to put together some guidelines for company-sponsored social events:

The company will provide soft drinks, beer, and wine.  You may choose to order other beverages at your expense.
Functions will run for a specified period of time.  If there is an open bar, we will establish a time certain after which Enron will not pay for any additional drinks.
If you require assisance getting home, please contact a taxi and submit the fare for expense reimbursement with no questions asked.  The last thing in the world we want is to have people break the law or put their safety and the safety of others in jeopardy.

Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks for your cooperation.
