Hey Mike,
	Will you look at deal #839722.1.  City of Shasta Lake sees they should pay us for this deal.  But there are no view actuals so it won't be in CARP or anywhere else for me to invoice them for it.  It is entered as a basis-option.  I am not familiar with those, but maybe that has something to do with it?  Also there was a deal #659898.1 for Shasta that I was given the confirm for.  I asked Stewart to look at it and see if he knew how we should settle it.  Maybe the two deals are related?  Will you look into these two deals and let me know?

Thanks - A
