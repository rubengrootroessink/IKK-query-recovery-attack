See Pat's email below regarding Dec numbers.  

Smurfit is showing a termination date of 12/6, see attachment on what Enpower is showing.

I can clean this up if Smurfit is correct just let me know.

Thanks

MP

Enron was in default on supply starting 12/5 and did not provide power
beyond 12/5.  This bill is not right at all.  I think Enron only provided
40mw 12/1 to 12/4 and 25mw 12/5.  Bill should be for 2400mwh at $54.65,
1440mwh at $33.50, and 600mwh at $46.72 (average price of both contracts).
Total of $182,232.

Here are the numbers for Dec.   

Per John Maloney the annuity to Charge you for Rampdown has been waived for
