Attached is a transmittal letter and report from the WMIC RTO Seams TF for your RTO's review and comment.  To facilitate discussion at the August 23-23 WMIC meeting, we would like to receive comments from each RTO by August 15.

The first attached file is the Transmittal letter and Report.  The other 4 files are attachments to the Report.  These are timeline charts and should be printed on legal size paper using a color printer.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Dean
