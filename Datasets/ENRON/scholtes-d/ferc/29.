Alan, et al,

Below is an importnat announcement from the CAISO about its OASIS upgrade implementation, I know some may have received it, but I believe it is important that we be sure all the right folks there in Portland have reviewed it. 

If there are any questions regarding this message I'll be happy to work with the CAISO to clarify any questions.

If there is anyone else in Portland who should review this message, please pass it along.

Kind Regards,

Dave
