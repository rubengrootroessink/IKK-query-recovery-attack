BPA short-term policy to encourage the use of small electric generation.

The Bonneville Power Administration hopes to establish a short-term policy =
to encourage the use of small electric generation to help the Northwest mee=
t its needs during the current energy shortage. Before implementing the pol=
icy in June, BPA wants to hear from the public on the details of the plan. =
The policy will encourage the immediate addition of electricity generation =
to help the region until planned long-term generation can be built. While B=
PA will not fund the construction of the generators nor buy the output, the=
 policy complements the load reduction strategy BPA has with its customers.=
 Customers who reduce their load on BPA by 10 percent would be allowed to u=
se temporary small generators to supply a small portion of their needs. BPA=
 has asked its customers to reduce their demands on BPA so BPA can avoid ex=
pensive large power purchases in the wholesale market. Such purchases could=
 lead to a triple-digit wholesale rate increase this October. The use of th=
e small generators, along with other actions such as energy conservation, c=
an help decrease reliance on BPA and thus help keep rates down. The generat=
ion plants would have to meet all applicable local, state and national regu=
lations. The temporary policy would apply from June 1, 2001, through Sept. =
30, 2002.
