Alan, et al,

It looks like the complaint filed by Morgan Stanley this past July, similar to the complaint we worked on regarding the ISO's TTC/ATC values and phantom congestion, is being attended to by FERC.  The Order attached to this message institiutes an investigation into the matter, orders the ISO to investigate intermediary actions which could be implemented to deal with phantom congestion in light of a total market redesign and orders an evidentiary hearing with an ALJ.

"The hearing should determine whether there are reasonable interim solutions available that would remedy this problem of "phantom congestion" for transmission users of the ISO grid absent a total market redesign.  We recognize that ultimately the regional market in the West must be operated under standard scheduling procedures that will apply to all market participants."

While the Morgan Stanley complaint did not address all of the issues ours did, it looks like they will be addressing the main issue, which essentially amounts to witholding of ATC.

Do we want to, or can we, participate in the hearing?

Thanks,

Dave
