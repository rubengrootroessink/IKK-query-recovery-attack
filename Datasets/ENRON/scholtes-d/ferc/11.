Mike and Caroline-

  Diana has asked that we let her know whenever we have variances, disputes, or make changes to any deals concerning these two counterparties Tacoma and Seattle City Light from today forward.  

  I suggest that we querry weekly for these 2 counterparties in DMS and provide Diana with a PMA report from DMS so that she can read any Settlements and VM comments in DMS about the deal and ask questions accordingly.

  Thanks,

  Virginia
