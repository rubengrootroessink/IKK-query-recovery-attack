We've been waiting for this shoe to drop for a while.

Please read this notice (copied below and also attached); I will be contact=
ing you next week for your thoughts on what Enron's position should be.

The very good news is the FERC is not asking the cap to be lowered; they ar=
e only asking to make it easier to raise it.

Regardless of our position, please be aware that this outcome of this case =
will likely be an increase in the probability that the cap could be raised =
above $91.87/MWh.

The earliest possible effective date of any change in methodology would pro=
bably be late November.
