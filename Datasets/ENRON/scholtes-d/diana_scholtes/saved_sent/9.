Due to scheduling conflicts, the meeting has been moved to Friday October 5 @ 10:00, Mt. Bachelor.  Serena has also mentioned that there are some problems balancing the hour ahead and day ahead Enpower to Caps.  So my guess would be to re-group earlier.

It was suggested by Tim Belden to re-group and analyze the processes in which FSP and Enpower synchronize.  I have set up a tentative date for everyone to meet.  Please let me know if this time is good for all.
