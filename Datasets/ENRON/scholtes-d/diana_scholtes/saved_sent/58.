I have already voted on these ballots through ISAS. With the increased interest in what ISAS is doing, raises some questions as to how and who I should be reporting issues to.  With Dave being on the WMIC, this coordination is extremely helpful and communication between both groups have started.  Maybe we should get together while Dave and Andy are in town to discuss.

Thanks,
Diana

Alan,
	This is Ray's not with attachments.  The vote is due by September 25th, so we have time to think.  I will come in tomorrow early to visit about this then we can advise Ray on how to respond.

Steve, this has to do with the ISAS E-tag business practices.  I would assume we're for it?  Thanks!  Ray
