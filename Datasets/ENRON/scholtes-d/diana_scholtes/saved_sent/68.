Sorry for such a delay in my response.  I've been out of the office on a customer tour.  The wheeling rate I'm quoting is under BPA new 2002 Tariff beginning in October 2001.  The wheel would get you from the Mid-Columbia to Garrison, which is BPA's integration with MPC System = 1.013 $/kW-mo plus 1.9 % losses.  Losses are real and need to be returned 168 hours there after.  Hope this helps!  I'm not sure how Mike S. has set the basis of Mid-C to MPC in the curves, but I assume you have access to those anyway!

Hi Diana, I was hoping that you had some information regarding the Mid-C to Montana basis, as well as the wheeling cost associated w/ Mid-C to Montana (Jeffrey Oh told me you'd be the person to go to).  I need these numbers thru 2024 (I understand the back years will be an estimate).  I'd be greatly appreciative if you could give me these numbers.  Thanks so much,

Chris Mumm
