2/2 & 2/3  PGE Purch total :  $699,706.40

2/5 & 6:  EPMI missing 400mw both sales & purch side, @ $0.10 adder - check presched sheets.

2/6 Totals:  PGE Sales - $854,589.52    PGE Purch - $848,622.32

2/7 & 2/8 :  Deal #515017.1 (2/7) & deal#516006.1 (2/8) show adder of $4.25.  The adder should be $4.50.

2/8 ALSO:  Deal #516034.1 shows wrong index - should be OFF.
2/8 PGE Sales total:  $1,644,733.04

2/23 & 24:  Deal #529170.1 & #529171.1 shows wrong index - should NOT be OFF.

There is a sheet showing PA for 2/1, 2/2 & 2/3, 1200mw @ $4.00.  I already show the $4.00 adder for 600mw for each of those days.  So, I'm clueless why these have been done.
