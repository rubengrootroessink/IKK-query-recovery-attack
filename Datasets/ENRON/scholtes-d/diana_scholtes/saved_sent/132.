Good Morning Diana,

With the new FSP California scheduling system going live soon, the California schedulers now have a new dependency on the Enpower auto-scheduler.  Currently, Cara, or one of her schedulers, usually starts the job by 7:15am and it finishes around 7:30 - 7:45am.  The problem is that FSP processing cannot begin until the auto-scheduler has completed which could then delay us from getting out our templates.

I would like to propose a change to the process where we have Kysa run the auto-scheduler job at the end of the day to roll the auto-scheduling date forward.  This would allow FSP processing to begin anytime during the morning and it should have no effect on the other scheduling in Enpower.

Please let me know if you have any concerns,
Thanks,  David Poston
