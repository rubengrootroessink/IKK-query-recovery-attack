Hey girl!

I cleaned up December, but I don't like 12/8.  It looks like this is the day that everything went to shit.  Research has to be done.  All other days are good.

I'll keep in touch,

ds

I have primarily looked at our sales to EPMI, so there may be more on our purchase side, but I'll have to let you know at a later time.

12/1:  deal #470853.1 - HE 22 should be 10mw, not 11mw - check presched sheet that EPMI creates (Donnie ?)  - This problem affects both sides.

12/8:  Deal #476161.1 - HE 1 should be 12mw, not 38; HE 2-6 should be 11mw, not 37; HE 23-24 should be 11mw, not 37.  Also, deal #476161.2 - HE 7-16 should be 16mw, not 0; HE 17-22 should be 15mw, not 6.  Mws were changed realtime p/EPMI's request.  This problem affects both sides.

12/19:  EPMI missing from both sales & purchase side:  HE 7-9, 2mw; HE 10-22, 4mw; HE 23 & 24, 1mw.  Check presched sheet - this was PCW interchange.

12/22:  deal#483473.2, HE 15-22, should be 11mw, not 12mw.  Check presched sheet.  This affects both sides (sales & purch).

12/23:  deal #483473.1 & .2, HE 12-22 should be 11mw, not 12.  HE 23 should be 33mw, not 34.  Check presched sheets.  This affects both sides.

Sorry, but that's all I have for now.  I have reviewed Jan & Feb. and think a majority of problems are just incorrect adders on our end.  Once we get thru July checkout, I will dive back into this !

Thanks !
Wyndi

I was working on this Friday.  I've only made it through EPMI's
purchases, but I can give you what I have so far, if you want.  Let me
know.  I will be heading out in about ? hour, but I may be able to
finish what I'm doing and get the info to you.
