July 2001, then we should be good:

(PGE system).  Our day total for our sales is $82,439.88

7/13 & 7/14:  Deal #683299.1 - needs correct index (not NF) of OFF - -
day total 7/13 = $55,054.30 & 7/14 = $48,907.74

7/23:  Deal #695822.1 - needs correct index of OFF (day tot=$184,848.56)

7/24:  Deal #697589.1 - needs correct index of OFF (day tot=$56,573.22)

7/25:  Deal #700116.1 - same as 7/24 (day total = $48,997.04)

Totals for PGE Sales:   $2,573,217.72

AND THAT'S IT !!!!
