Diana, 
I'll be sending you an itinerary soon.  Cynthia (travel agency) is putting it together right now.  I put the
car under your name.  Hope that's OK.   Times look good, so other then that I wondered if you wanted
to buy a non-refundable ticket or a refundable ticket.  They are about a $120 difference.  I believe one 
price is $304.25 (non-refundable) or $427.25 (refundable)

Let me know what tickets you would like to go with.

Thanks, Jill
