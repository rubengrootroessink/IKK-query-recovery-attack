Thank you for looking into this for me.  Can you tell me for what day the variance in December is for?  Also, when do you expect to have January resolved?

Diana-

  I'll have a more definite answer tomorrow, but for now, it looks like we're current with SCL except for a variance of approx $1000 for January 2001 and $7000 for December 2000.  Hiope this helps for now.
