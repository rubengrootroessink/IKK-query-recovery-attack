We are short at PGE system for Wednesday, 10/03/01.  HE7-22pdt, we are 25mw short (total of 400mw).  This is due to a lending deal done by the NW Cash desk.  Please supply Portland at their system in the most cost effective manner possible.  Deal #799806.1

Thanks, 
Donald Robinson, NW preschedule desk
