There's an Annuity in the system which reflects the $1 payment instead of changing the deal.  This will reference back to my fix and request for Auto Scheduling.....???

 Diana-

  Per BPA, for deal # 486140.1, the deal was amended 6/29/01 where 150mw of hlh was adjusted from 216.00 to 217.00 for the whole month except 7-4-01nerc holiday.
  Can you or Driscoll verify that this is true?  This will be a ($60,000) impact.

  Thanks,

  Virginia
