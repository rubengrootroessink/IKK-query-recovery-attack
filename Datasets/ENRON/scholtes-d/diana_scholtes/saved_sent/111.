absolutely not!  besides he hasn't talked to me since I scolded him for not showing up last time.  I think I reminded him too much of his wife!  His loss!  You need to get instant messaging.  Go to the AOL site or to MSN and sign up....its free.
Join the real world.  Besides, you employers can't track it!

love,

your sister

The girls arrive at 10:35 pm this Saturday (Aug. 18), Southwest Flt.
2187.
Apparently your mother thinks they are coming tomorrow for some reason.
I
leave for Chicago on Sunday, return the following Wednesday and will be
driving up on Saturday Aug. 25.

Why don't you fly down Friday night and drive up with me?
