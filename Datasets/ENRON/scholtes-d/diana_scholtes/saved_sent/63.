I didn't separate the PGE data, only BPA by your request.  If you need me to do so please let me know.

Diana:

Looks great.  I have a follow up questions:

It looks like you parsed PGE data into the 4 buckets (Network-ST , Network LT, IT ST, IT LT). Is that true (i.e. 100% of our PGE usage is IT LT) or would disaggregating our usage on PGE require more work?

Thanks,

Alan
