I don't have any idea.  For some reason this has taken over a month to get them set up.

Douglas County has been trying to get signed up with EOL for over a month.  From what the Help Desk is telling me, they believe its sitting with legal at this point.  Can you please assist us in getting their paperwork finished?

Much appreciated!
