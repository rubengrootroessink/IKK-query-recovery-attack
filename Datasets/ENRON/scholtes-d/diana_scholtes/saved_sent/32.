Mark,

Can you re-clarify the policy for using the 3-4 character acronyms again.  There are assumptions being made that tags will be denied, starting Oct. 1,  if you don't use the new 3-4 character POR/POD list even if its prior to the implementation of spec 1.7.  References are being made to your clarification e-mail.  But I don't read anything that states tags will be denied.

Thanks,
