Hi all--During the week of August 20, BPA-TBL will be holding training
sessions concerning the new Customer Web Interface.  Other aspects of the
Open Access Transmission Tariff that goes into effect on 10/1/01 will also
be discussed.  I encourage you and your scheduling staff to attend.  For
more information, including an explanation of how to register to attend the
sessions, please see the attachment.  

Take care,
