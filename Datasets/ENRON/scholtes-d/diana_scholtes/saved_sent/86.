Subject:	Lousiana Pacific Deal # 421598.1

All-

  Per an inquiry from Lousiana Pacific regarding deal # 421598.1 (LT NW):

  Structure: 		7 MW around the clock, 100% load factor. Buy back at basis or remarket at a 70% / 30% split.
  
  February 23, 2001:  	Load was taken from 7 MW to 4 MW for HE 11 - 24.  Deal # 421598.1 was reduced from a 7 MW to a 4 MW (D. Scholtes).
			We remarketed the 3 MW's real time to WWP deal # 530654.1 (source PGE).  We did not enter a deal to keep LP whole.   
  
  February 24, 2001:  	Load was taken from 7 MW to 4 MW for HE 1 - 24.   Deal # 421598.1 was reduced from a 7 MW to a 4 MW (D. Scholtes).
			We remarketed the 3 MW's real time to Puget for HE 1-9 deal # 530689.1 and to WWP for HE 10-24 deal # 530716.1.
			We did not enter a deal to keep LP whole.   
  
 August 29, 2001:  	Virginia set deal # 421598.1 back to 7 MW, keeping sale to LP whole, and entered deal # 754187.1 to buy back 3 MW of LP energy at 70 % of  the 			price sold real time. (70% / 30% split according to agreement with LP). 
			VT routed original purchase from PGE-deal 529161.1 (ST NW) back to Lousiana Pacific-deal # 421598.1 (LT NW) and routed the "buy-back" deal # 			754187.1 (ST W HOURLY) to WWP and to Puget (ST W HOURLY).

  I think that this will properly take care of the dispute and make Lousiana Pacific happy.  Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.


  Thanks,

  Virginia
