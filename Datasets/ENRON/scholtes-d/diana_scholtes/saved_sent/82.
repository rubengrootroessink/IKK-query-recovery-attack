With us being a satellite office, its been a bit difficult to get a consensus!  Our IT group luckily confirmed an easy transition.  I believe our biggest hurdle will be how to manage existing contracts going forward.  Not sure what the impact of it will be financially yet.  Once that question gets answered, I'll be able to respond!  It will probably be near our Vancouver meeting, I'm assuming!!!

Thanks again,

Diana

If you haven't sent it yet, I am still getting them so it is not too late.
If someone did send it then my secretary has it and it will be included in
the summary.

Things are actually going fairly well. It is a bit scary.  Hope this summer
has been fun for you!

Hey Lisa!  What's the requested response time for the survey?  I have to
push this out to several people and I'm not sure when they need to get
this to me by.  I just keep telling them ASAP!!!  

Hope everything is going well,
