Not quite as easy as January, but here it is:

2/2 & 3:  Deal #510940.1 - shows wrong index - should be OFF.
2/2 & 2/3  PGE Purch total :  $699,706.40

2/5 & 6:  EPMI missing 400mw both sales & purch side, @ $0.10 adder - check presched sheets.
2/5 Totals:  PGE Sales - $650,589.20    PGE Purch - $646,262.00
2/6 Totals:  PGE Sales - $854,589.52    PGE Purch - $848,622.32

2/7 & 2/8 :  Deal #515017.1 (2/7) & deal#516006.1 (2/8) show adder of $4.25.  The adder should be $4.50.
2/7 PGE Sales total:  $877,642.40

2/8 ALSO:  Deal #516034.1 shows wrong index - should be OFF.
2/8 PGE Sales total:  $1,644,733.04

2/23 & 24:  Deal #529170.1 & #529171.1 shows wrong index - should NOT be OFF.
2/23  PGE Sales total:  $869,711.36    PGE Purch total:  $863,688.16
2/24  PGE Sales total:  $869,132.96    PGE Purch total:  $863,109.76

February 2001 PGE Sales totals:  $30,577,660.00

There is a sheet showing PA for 2/1, 2/2 & 2/3, 1200mw @ $4.00.  I already show the $4.00 adder for 600mw for each of those days.  So, I'm clueless why these have been done.
