Sorry Fran and Samantha!  Didn't get you on the initial e-mail!  

Virginia, can we get someone to auto schedule this deal for the new time span?

Thanks!

This deal was entered incorrectly.  The date span was only for 7/1/01 instead of 7/1 - 7/31.  This annuity represents the $1 charge to move 150 MW on peak to Big Eddy for the month.

Sorry for the inconvenience,
