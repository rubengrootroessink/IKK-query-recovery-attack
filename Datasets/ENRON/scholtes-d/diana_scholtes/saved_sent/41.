Hey can you look to see if there was a sink with Burbank on this day?

Diana-

  We just got a call from Steve at PGE regarding the following:

  There was a scheduled outage on the DC tie on August 4, 2001 that was supposed to run thru HE 12, but that outage actually lasted until HE 16.  
  PGE is saying that we sank at Burbank but that Burbank doesn't want to pay PGE.  
  I'm not sure what this means or how this is our problem, but if you know anything about it, please let me know.
  If you want Steve's extention, it's x7410.

  Thanks,

  Virginia
