I've seen this one before, but it's always funny...

BEER
I have not seen anyone explain this as well as Cliff Clavin, on Cheers.  The
Buffalo Theory as told by Cliff Clavin: One afternoon at Cheers, Cliff
Clavin was explaining the Buffalo Theory to his buddy Norm, and here's how
it went: "Well ya see, Norm, it's like this... A herd of buffalo can only
move as fast as the slowest buffalo. And when the herd is hunted, it is the
slowest and weakest ones at the back that are killed first. This natural
selection is good for the herd as a whole, because the general speed and
health of the whole group keeps improving by the regular killing of the
weakest members.  "In much the same way, the human brain can only operate as
fast as the slowest brain cells. Excessive intake of alcohol, as we know,
kills brain cells. But naturally it attacks the slowest and weakest brain
cells first. In this way, regular consumption of beer eliminates the weaker
brain cells, making the brain a faster and more efficient machine." That's
why you always feel smarter after a few beers
