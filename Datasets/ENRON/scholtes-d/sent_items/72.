Deal # 614339.1 in the LTCA book has been changed from a fixed price of $158 to $155.  This is due to us not facilitating and paying for the CDWR In-Area sleeve.

In discussion with Bob Floyd with CDWR and Mike Brommer from TID, Enron will continue its obligations to TID with a delivery @ NP-15.  CDWR and TID have entered into the $3 In-Area facilitation between themselves.  If you have any further questions, please call me at 503-464-3807.

Thanks again!
