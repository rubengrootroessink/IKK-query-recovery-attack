Time is running very short.  Is your company prepared for Etag 1.7?  These are the minimum REQUIRED steps that must be completed prior to March 6, 2002:

---------------------------

(1)  All entities must update the NERC Registry at http://www.tsin.com.

(1a)  CA's and TP's must designate PORs and PODs that are valid on tags.

(1b)  PSE's must designate associated scheduling PORs and PODs.  See http://www.tsin.com or inquire with NERC for details.

---------------------------

(2)  All OATI Users must have functioning OATI Digital Certificates.

(2a)  Without the certificate you cannot access Etag 1.7 after March 6, 2002 at all.

(2b)  Inquire internally to determine if a supervisor has already contacted us.

(3b)  To begin the process of acquiring OATI Digital Certificates, please complete this document and send it to OATI:

---------------------------

Failure to complete these steps will result in a partial or complete lack of tagging access and capability!

For additional information on these and other critical Etagging issues, please visit OATI's Etag 1.7 Information Page at http://www.oatiinc.com/etag17.
