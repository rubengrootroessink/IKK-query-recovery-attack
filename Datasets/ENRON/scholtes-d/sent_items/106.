Hey Monica!

Long time no hear!  Just wanted to make sure you and Kristian are doing fine.  Morale here is extremely low.  I'm sure its the same there.  But we continue to be busy.  Good thing for all of us!  When are you guys coming back to the states?  By the way, how are your parents?  I hope they are safe and well.  Keep in touch!

Diana
