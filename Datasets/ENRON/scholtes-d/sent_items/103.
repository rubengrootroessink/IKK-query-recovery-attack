Top 10 reasons why trick or treating is better than sex..... 8 )~


10. You're guaranteed to get at least a little something in the sack.

9. If you get tired, you can wait ten minutes and go at it again.

8. The uglier you look, the easier it is to get some.

7. You don't have to compliment the person who gave you candy.

6. It's okay when the person you're with fantasizes you're someone else,
because you ARE someone else.

5. 40 years from now you will still enjoy candy.

4. If you don't get what you want, you can always go next door.

3. It doesn't matter if the kids hear you moaning and groaning.

2. Less guilt the next morning.

 .....AND the #1 reason,

1. You can do the whole neighborhood!!

 Happy Halloween ! Be safe!
