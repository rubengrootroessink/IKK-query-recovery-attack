O.K.!  Just to keep you appraised of what I'm doing,  I have left a message with Bob Sullivan @ CISO and I spoke to WAPA.  I think the call to WAPA was just to notify them that they won't be managing Shasta's transmission position for the term of our deal.  I'm going to be working with Bob Sullivan to create procedures for scheduling purposes.  Not sure if you want to stay in the loop for that?  You can update Gerry though, for me.  I appreciate your help!

Thanks

Diana

Diana,

Great work.  Is there anything you need me to do?

If everything is in place, I will contact Gerry Cupp at Shasta letting him know.  Or, if he needs to do something, I will get that started.

Thanks,

Laird

Vicky,

Thank you again for you assistance with this process.  As you requested, this is our notification to PG&E of our purchase from the City of Shasta Lake of their COTP Transmission Capacity bi-directionally.  The term of the deal will include the months of November and December 2001.  Also as you requested, I faxed the Confirmation Notice between Shasta and EPMI to your office.  I have listed my office number below if you have any further questions.

Thanks again,

Diana Scholtes
