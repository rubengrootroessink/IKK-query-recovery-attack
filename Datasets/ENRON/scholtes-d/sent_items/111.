Diana,

Would you be available to help me with the Assoc / Analyst recruiting this week?  We are going to Portland State this week.  

Here's how it works:  There is an Info Session on Thursday at 5:00 PM and interviews on Friday.  The Info Session is from 5:00 PM  --> 6:30.  There is a PowerPoint presentation which explains Enron's business  which depending upon how many questions, usually takes from an hour to an hour and a half.

Then, Friday morning, we are only interviewing in the morning from 8:00 AM to 12:00 Noon.  The interviews are 1/2 hour each.  You should be back to the office before Noon. 

Would your schedule allow you to help me out?
