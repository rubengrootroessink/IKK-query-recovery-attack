I will concur with Cara's response of nothing serious as to bring up in a formal setting.

Alan,

The forwarded message below contains an issue cited by Dick Ingersoll back in June of 1997 in which Control Areas were changing the properties of our submitted schedules/transactions (tags?) and not informing us.  In a subsequent letter in September 2000 Dick had noted an imporvement but with Enron still experiencing some minor problems.

My question(s) to you and the traders/schedulers are, are the problems noted above still occuring, is this still causing us problems and if so are there specific incidents that you can provide to me so I can pass them on to the WSCC?

Please accpet my wishes for a Happy Thanksgiving!

Kind Regards,

Dave
