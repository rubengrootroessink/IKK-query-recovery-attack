Hi!  It has been a long time!  As you know things here are very shaky.  I c=
an't believe the big E has crumbled!  Who would have ever guessed!  Everyon=
e is completely disappointed and mostly pissed off.  I'll have to give you =
the inside scoop sometime when we get together!  And we need to!  I'll be t=
raveling around making my rounds to find out what's in the market place soo=
n. So, hopefully I'll get a chance to see you.  Any chance of you and Mark =
coming down?  We have plenty of room for the two of you; you're always welc=
ome.  I love your house!  Thanks for sending the picture.  Its so exciting =
but its also a lot of work!  I'm glad I'm done!  It's nice to be in the hou=
se, but also funny all the work and effort you put in and how exciting it i=
s all those months while you're in the process....all to be completely indi=
fferent with it afterwards!  Its very strange, but what to do?  Natalie, I =
can't believe is 3!  And a very terrible 3.  My hands are full!  I'm contem=
plating of putting her in ski school this winter.  She quite the daring chi=
ld, so I think she'll enjoy.  Ask Mark for me if this is too young.  She wo=
n't think so, its mostly my fear. =3D)  You'll get a kick of the pictures I=
've attached.  One of them is my depiction a young Penny Lane. Hopefully yo=
u saw Almost Famous to understand my analogy!  You'll also notice the Beagl=
e that Bill bought for Natalie.  HAHA! His name is Presley.  She's absolute=
ly in love with him.=20

Keep in touch!
Diana

Hi Diana...haven't spoken to you in awhile so thought I'd drop you a note.
Hope all is well amongst this crazy market and confusing time. =20

I assume you are in your new house and wondered how you are enjoying it as =
I
can't really imagine EVER moving in.  I am sure it will happen one day!
Below is a picture Mark took yesterday (just proof that it is really moving
ahead!) and thought I'd forward to you...perhaps you could give me your
opinion, based on it's current stage of construction, how much longer I
might be at my in-laws!?!?!?!?

Take care!
Lisa
