ISAS Members and Interested Parties,

OATI is currently not prepared to accommodate open ended testing during the
WSCC test period of now through Tuesday, February 12, 2002. However, they
have graciously agreed to provide us with two, four hour test periods as
follows:

Thursday, February 7, 2002, 0800-1200PPT
 
Monday, February 11, 2002, 0800-1200PPT 

Please make best efforts to kick the tires on E-Tag 1.7 during these time
frames. We have attached another copy of the WSCC testing guidelines.

Thanks and Good Luck!
