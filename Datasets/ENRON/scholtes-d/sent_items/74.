oops, also the annuity for the 7th is with volume of 24MW/hr, should it be 25MW/hr?

Diana and Sean:

Up to 11/26/01, 
1. we are missing the annuities for 11/7, 11/18, 11/19, 11/22, 11/23, and 11/24
2. we need to restore HE23-24 for deal# 517676.1 for 11/2/01 (lightload sale in NP15) in scheduling

Please let me know if you need any help entering the annuities or restoring the HE23-HE24 scheduling (for 11/2/01 for deal 517676.1).

As the month-end is approaching, I am hoping we can clear the above issues up before Settlements captures the wrong P&L.

Thanks,

Fran
