Here we go!!!!

My Purchases:

8/9	To BPA-EPMI(PWX) 51 mw should be priced at 70.72 and not 70.22  Total= $433,054.06
8/17  Looks like your missing the park/lending deal [150 peak @41.21; 100 off @ 31.39] Total=$269,516.56
8/18  Same as the 17th. Total= 267,475.56

Once these are fixed I'm good on the purchase side.  Will be working on my sales to you next!

thanks

ds
