JOINT GUIDANCE COMMITTEE

WESTERN MARKET INTERFACE COMMITTEE
INTERCHANGE SCHEDULING and ACCOUNTING SUBCOMMITTEE


Dear JGC, OC, WMIC and ISAS,

On November 29, 2001, the WSCC Joint Guidance Committee (JGC) approved
formation of a new working group to coordinate western positions and/or
proposals on Electronic Scheduling issues and practices.  This new working
group (called the WSCC Electronic Scheduling Work Group or ESWG) will
report to the JGC and coordinate with the OC, WMIC and ISAS.  Attached
please find the ESWG Scope Statement.

As many of you are aware, the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative currently
being facilitated by NERC is moving forward at a rapid pace on many issues.
In order to be more productive and proactive with the formation of
electronic scheduling issues and practices, the ESWG would like to make you
aware of this new group and invite your participation and assistance to
more adequately ensure a broader representation of WSCC interests.  To this
end, if you are interested in being an active member of this work group, or
if you are interested in being on the email exploder for this group, please
reply to this email as follows:

Please provide (via reply to this email):
1. Your name and organization
2. Your email address
3. Yes/No for being an active member (i.e. - you will provide comments,
attend meetings, etc as feasible)
4. Yes/No for being on the ESWG email exploder (you will receive all emails
of the working group)

Please note - if your name is listed below, then you will automatically be
added on the working group email exploder and there is no need to reply to
this email (unless you want to be removed).
