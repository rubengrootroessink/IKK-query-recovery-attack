Vicky,

Thank you again for you assistance with this process.  As you requested, this is our notification to PG&E of our purchase from the City of Shasta Lake of their COTP Transmission Capacity bi-directionally.  The term of the deal will include the months of November and December 2001.  Also as you requested, I faxed the Confirmation Notice between Shasta and EPMI to your office.  I have listed my office number below if you have any further questions.

Thanks again,

Diana Scholtes
