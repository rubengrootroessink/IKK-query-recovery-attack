Diana,

As a follow-up to our discussions earlier this week, Sally Long (Al Paschke's assistant) called me this morning to inform me that 

1.  TBL "inappropriately denied our tag last week."

2.  She has "educated a few people" so this won't happen again.


Let me know if you have any further problems.

Steve
