Here are some thoughts.  


Under the OATT, enforcement of these creditworthiness provisions is discretionary, i.e., BPA is not required to do this and could choose to give us a week or two to get our house in order.  Also, since BPA's Power Business Line owes us so much money, it seems we should be able to use those receivables as collateral, or as a financing mechanism, e.g., have BPA PBL make direct payment to TBL.
