Bob,
 
I appreciate your input.
 
The OC Steering Committee has asked us to become more effective. We need to do our best to satisfy their request.
 
Our goal is to ensure we get the best product in the most efficient manner we can. ISAS has always had voting members. These members have determined the outcome of issues that the group is responsible for. I believe the current voting structure of ISAS is typical of the Operations Committee and the Sub-committees reporting to the OC. An OC member has the ability to appoint one representative from his/her company. In at least one case in the WSCC, an individual company has two OC members. One member represents the transmission/reliability side and one member represents the merchant side. 
 
Diverse opinions often lead to the best decisions. The intent of focusing on the voting members is to make the most of the limited time we have to make decisions. Non-voting members will still have the ability to take the floor to voice their views. However, the discussion will be limited so that we can complete our business. I suggest that we see how the February meeting goes. We can discuss proposed changes to the format prior to the next meeting. However, these changes must still comply with WSCC guidelines and OC direction.
 
The Joint Guidance Committee is currently revising the "Guidelines For Administering the Membership of WSCC Subcommittees, Work Groups And Task Forces."
The proposed revision is attached.
 
Thanks.

Steve, 
  

We have some concerns regarding the format you suggest for the upcoming ISAS meeting which consists of the agenda and discussion being driven primarily by the voting member.  As you know in PNM's case (and others) we have only one WSCC membership. Our Merchant and Reliability functions are still under the same company as required by current laws and regulations.  We do however operate as totally independent shops thus having different tasks, issues, insights and etc.  Neither shop is able to sufficiently represent the issues of the other.  

We are concerned that by limiting discussions to only "the voting member" much insight will be lost.   We would be interested in hearing from both sides of a company on issues.  I would suggest this committee consider structuring discussion and voting privileges along the lines of those being set up in other industry forums {ESC, GISB, NAERO, NAESB and etc.} where a company represented in WSCC would have voting/discussion privileges for representatives from each business sector.  In WSCC that should include at least a Reliability and/or a Merchant rep.(if applicable) even if the company holds only one WSCC membership.  

I do understand and support the need to control the size of this meeting and would not want to see decisions made strictly from votes by those in attendance. We feel it very important to have fair representation in the subcommittee of all concerned entities.  

I have been trying to find someone at WSCC who is involved with revision of the document titled "Guidelines For Administering the Membership of WSCC Subcommittees, Work Groups And Task Forces" which you indicated was being revised.  I have not been able to find out who this person is and am unable to find anything about it on the WSCC web site...could you provide a name?  As you know, this document has not been modified since 1991.  We would like to make sure the revisions reflect the needs of all the industry as we know it today.  We have some thoughts and concerns which we would like considered in the revision process.

Thanks, 
Bob Winn 
PNM
