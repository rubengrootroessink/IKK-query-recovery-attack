> I'm happy to announce (you're the first to know, officially) that we are
> once again hosting the 6th annual Mid-C Marketing Seminar here in
> Wenatchee. The dates are July 9th for a semi-pro baseball game & BBQ, July
> 10th for the meeting and July 11th for a golf tournament. I realize this
> is an early request, but helps with the logistics as we approach the
> dates.
> 
> Last year, your company helped us by making a donation in the amount of
> $500.00 toward sponsorship of the golf tournament. That was very
> beneficial to Mid-C Services, played a large part in the success of  the
> seminar and we appreciated it very much.
>  
> We are offering you the same opportunity this year. Chelan PUD cannot
> legally sponsor this tournament, so your participation is important.
> Please don't feel obligated, but if this works for you, we will publicize
> your sponsorship as much as possible during the 2-day event.
> 
> Most importantly, we want you to join us and participate in the learning
> and fun. Please respond to me at your convenience. 
> 
> Thank You, Doug
