ISAS Members and Interested Parties,

Last week, Raymond Vojdani raised some very valid concerns about the E-Tag
1.7 Specification. SRP found some time to research these issues. Our
comments are attached. 

Raymond, 
Thanks for bringing these issues to the WSCC's attention.

Hi Steve,

As we approach the impending implementation of E-Tag 1.7, we have begun
reviewing and studying the new features of the Tag Services interface as
explained at the NERC Workshops and as developed by our vendor, OATI. 
The implementation of the E-Tag 1.7 Specifications has raised some
questions.

1. On the section of the tag where the PSE creates the Physical Path
for the transaction, there are required fields for the Generating
Control Area, the Load Control Area, and the intermediate Transmission
Providers.  There is not a requirement to document the intermediate
Control Areas (there is a location to include them as Scheduling
Entities, but those fields are optional).  This would seem to be a
significant obstacle to providing all Control Areas the information they
need to perform hourly schedule checks with their neighboring Control
Areas.  Also, in WSCC, where certain Control Areas are responsible for
managing constrained paths, this would be an obstacle in determining
scheduled flows across the constrained paths.  It is possible (even
likely) to create tags where the Control Area would not see the tag,
because the transmission used is owned by Transmission Providers other
than the Control Area.  Was it the intent of the NERC E-Tag 1.7
Specification to remove intermediate Control Areas from visibility and
approval of the tags?

2. Once an E-Tag has been approved, and has achieved the Implement
state, it appears to have immortality.  Even when the 'final hour' of
the current version of the tag has passed, the tag does not appear to be
inactive; it is available for the creating PSE to access and extend by
an Adjust request.   This feature could potentially bog our system down
with numerous tags that are presently 'inactive' but always available
for adjusting.  Did the NERC specifications intend for an Implemented
tag to eventually become 'inactive' and unavailable for adjustment?

3. A related concern to tag Adjustment Requests; under E-Tag 1.7, a PSE
may now create a tag and accomplish ongoing scheduling through the
Extension of the tag by adjusting (oh, boy, account number scheduling
has returned).  At the NERC E-Tag 1.7 Training Workshop, the Timing
Requirement for Profile Changes, WSCC, is 15 minutes to evaluate any
early notice.  This could be a significant business change; the PSE can
accomplish preschedule functions by requesting tag extensions (15
minutes evaluation time) rather than creating new tags (3 hour
evaluation time).   The clear distinction between Next Day schedules and
Real Time schedules is being lost.  Perhaps the evaluation time of an
any Profile Change Request could be linked directly to the impact time
of that change request, similar to the timing requirements for
submission and evaluation of New Tag Requests.

Considering the above shortcomings, especially item #1, it is
impossible for us to move toward implementation of E-Tag 1.7, for, we
will not be able to  check out the net interchange with our neighboring
control areas or be able to manage the constrained paths in our control
area. Please give me a call should you have any question or if you want
to discuss this further.  Thanks.

ISAS Members,

Attached is a draft test procedure for E-Tag 1.7. It was created and
approved by a small "swat team" of ISAS members and WSCC Staff. Please
review this draft procedure and provide any comments you may have by
1200
MST Tuesday, January 29, 2002. 

Thanks.
