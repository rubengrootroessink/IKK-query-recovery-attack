Diana,

First, let me give you my condolences for having to attend an ISAS committee meeting!

To answer your question, yes, I am now the Enron representative on the WMIC.  As for the RTO Seams meetings, Steve Walton is the Enron rep attending those and I follow the proceedings (I was part of that group while at APX)

I agree there are many issues the WMIC deals with and I am happy to represent Enron.  As you can probably see from the report I had sent out, we need to be vigulant on many of the issues they are considering.  If you have specific concerns with ISAS that you'd like me to champion, or any other issues in the WSCC that concern you commercially/operationally,  please let me know.

FYI, we are planning a Government Affairs meeting on Wednesday August 1, towards the end of the meeting (around 4:30, but I can change the time to better meet your schedule) I was hoping to have an opportunity to meet with yourself, Sean, Bill Williams and anyone else who would be interested in walking through some of the new enhancements that are being developed associated with the NWOASIS.

Kind Regards,

Dave

Hello Dave!

Are you the Enron rep. for the WMIC?  The reason I ask is because at times during the WSCC ISAS meeting which I attend, there are market issues that we can't address due to our scope; reliability.  From what I understood, in the past we didn't have anyone attending, but we may now since there are seams issues due to the RTO.  Even outside of the RTO, I believe we need to attend.  Could you please let me know if you're a regular and how many times the group meets?  

Thanks for your help!!

To All,

Attached to this message is a complete report on issues that are of concern to Enron.  

Below is a highlight version of the key issues contained in the report.  

FERC Seam Technical Conference report by Frank Afranji - Key message - Western RTOs, act now, act responsibly, if you don't FERC will do it for us and impose the PJM model
OASIS Phase II as reported by Jerry Dempsey - Key message - Western entities need to be more pro-active in attending and providing input to the NERC Electronic Scheduling Collaborative otheriwse they run the risk of NERC imposing standards which are not applicable to western RTO development.
Resource Adequacy - aka - Installed Capacity Markets.  NERC is considering California as an example of how the "Market" has failed to provide adequate generating resources to meet the needs of the region.  There are discussions now taking place to consider development of "Resource Adequacy" standards.
RTO Congestion Management Updates - When citing how DSTAR will align closly with RTO West's physical flow-path congestion management paradigm, Jerry Smith of APS publically corrected Mike Raezer and stated that on "Day-One" the DSTAR PTOs are implementing contract path.
West of Hatway - Rating decrease from 2800 to 2200, reasons and remidies along with possible new RAS requirements.
Path Connectivity Map - Does this idea make sense?  What would you like to see added? (Traders input requested)


If you have any questions, concerns or wish to be removed from the distribution list, please contact me.

Kind Regards,

Dave
