Because UBSW Energy will be dedicating a stream of net revenues to the Enron Estate, which still owns the FERC-jurisdictional utility PGE, it appears that the FERC attornies are telling us, out of an abundance of caution,  that we will need to treat PGE as an affiliate and PGE will need to treat UBSW Energy as an affilate.  As far as I know the the proposed affiliate restrictions are similar to those imposed on EPMI and PGE when EPMI got its market based rate certificate.  Recall that recently PGE was denied access to Enron Online and I assume that the same restrictions would continue to apply to PGE and UBSW Energy.

Please review the draft code of conduct, which will be a part of our market based rate (MBR) application, and let me know your concerns.  Now is the time to raise issues as we have not yet filed our MBR application.

Of course, these restrictions will fall away once PGE is sold.
