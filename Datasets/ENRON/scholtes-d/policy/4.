Diana,

As I recall, you are our rep on the ISAS.  I have read the E-Tag document and it looks OK to me.  Are there any problems with the document from your perspective that I should be aware of?  It looks like the new procedure will be in effect within a month or so (I assume after any voting as noted below)  In the meantime, there will be a WMIC meeting on August 23 and 24 that I plan on attending, if there are any issues you have with the linked document below or anything else, please let me know so I can raise the issue at the WMIC.

Thanks,

Dave
