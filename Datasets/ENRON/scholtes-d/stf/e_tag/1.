I think you are right on! In addition, I would like to get a number of the
timing issues resolved prior to implementing "No Tag, No Flow."  The
problems with a non-complete POR/POD list; the lack of closure/agreement on
the Joint owned generators/points,etc.; I believe are going to create huge
problems for everyone involved.
