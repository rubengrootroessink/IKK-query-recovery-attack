Sorry for the late response, I just got it today.  PacifiCorp would be in favor of any move that lessened the amount of time changes that occur each year whether that be to PST or PPT.  The preferential order would be PST for no changes, PPT for one change each year and then dropping it altogether as the last alternative.

It's been brought to my attention that we never resolved the issue of the 
common scheduling time (no Freudian slip on the acronym).  The group agreed 
to a PST value in July, but we wanted to survey the OC and WMIC first before 
going further.  That was to be one of our topic in Vancouver.  Well.... 

So, I'd like to get a feel from the group: the survey leaned toward Pacific 
Prevailing Time as that match up with energy products, so.. continue to go 
forward with PST as in July, modify our suggestion to PPT or drop all 
together and wait to see if NERC is going to come up with something.  If we 
decide to go with either PST or PPT, I will get the OC Steering to help with 
clarification on this as a due process item or an item that can be brought 
to the OC for vote in 2002.  In addition, I would think that most would 
agree that implementation if it takes affect would be favorable at the April 
2002 time change, so that is my suggestion that we use, if ISAS goes forward 
with the request to the OC. 

Please get back with your thought by next Wednesday so I can put together 
something for the upcoming OC meetings.
