Here is my NERC IS 08/22/01-08/24/01 Meeting Report.  
<<NERC IS 08-01 meeting report-LACEN.doc>> 

Major Highlights: 
NERC IS voted against the WSCC's tagging changes to Version 5 of Policy 3: 

?       Add the following to third bullet under Section A2.1 - (Deference to the WSCC where Dynamic Interchange Schedules are of known amounts by the sending and receiving control areas, have existing transmission, and the TP's are aware of the amounts are exempt from being tagged.) 

?       Add the following to the fourth bullet under Section A2.1 - (Deference to the WSCC where existing procedure require notification of bilateral payback to be made via the WSCC Messaging network, amounts are limited to 25 megawatts per hour unless all parties are notified are exempt from being tagged.  Amount in excess of 25 megawatts per hour will be tagged.)  The NERC IS's general consensus is that all schedules should be tagged.

NERC IS accepted the WSCC's Timetable to be included in V5 of policy 3 for 1.7 E-tagging with the TISWG/OSC changes. 

E-Tag Implementation delay to November 13, 2001: 

The primary reason for delaying the implementation of E-Tag 1.7 is the lack of a complete Registry.  This issue has now been raised to the most significant item that must be addressed for the NEW - November 13, 2001 implementation date.
