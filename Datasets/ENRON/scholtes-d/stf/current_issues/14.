Hi Marilyn - 

Thanks for the Vancouver notes.  Regarding the item on POR/PODs - since the
meeting, Mark sent out the Clarification letter of September 24 (attached)
stating we use the WSCC POR/POD acronyms until 1.7 hits the streets.  E-Tag
1.7 will use the POR/PODs that TPs have attempted to register
http://reg.tsin.com/ .  Although not part of the actual meeting, it might be
good to add a reference to the clarification letter so readers can get the
latest and greatest direction concerning POR/PODs usage.
