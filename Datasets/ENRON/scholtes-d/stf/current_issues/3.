 <<Comments on NECR Policy 3.doc>> This document contains narratives for
comments that Kevin Johnson (BPA-PBL) came up with while reviewing the
Official the November 2001 NERC MIC and OC meeting Policy 3 Action Item
Materials.  These comments point out  a couple of places in the WSCC
portions of Policy 3 where the specified timings need to be modified
slightly to make them consistent with all of the related time frames, as
intended by ISAS.  

 <<Appendix3A1v3-WSCC Timing Modifications.doc>> This document  contains the
specific Policy 3 redlines that I interpret as being necessary to implement
these comments.

Per Gordon Scott and Charles Yeung, we did not have to go through motions at
the NERC MIC and OC to get these changes made.  They only asked that we pass
them to ISAS for verification and support prior to NERC IS incorporating
them.

Mark Hackney --

		When I spoke with him about this, Don Lacen agreed to review
and coordinate these comments  with NERC IS.  As ISAS chair, Mark, I ask
your review of and support for these comments and Don's efforts to get them
incorporated.

If anyone has specific questions regarding these comments, please direct
them to Kevin Johnson.

Thanks -

Deanna Phillips (BPA-PBL)

Easy reading and it all fits on one page with a 14 font!  It just says to
align all the timelines with the ones developed by the ISAS.
