PacifiCorp is probably responsible for the onslaught of these Email's.  Mos=
t of PacifiCorp's Merchant tags that moved energy from CA to CA at a genera=
tor bus already used the term "NOR".  In our attempts to improve the checko=
ut process so we could see our Merchant's schedules by tag I requested a so=
ftware change to allow us to start scheduling his tags that contained the A=
Ref value of "NOR" (No Oasis Required).  We then asked him to continue to u=
se it and requested that he inform all those he did business with to also u=
se it on our line so we could schedule against it.  I was not thinking abou=
t nor remembered Business Practice #11 at the time we implemented this and =
didn't realize it would be an issue.  Since the notification, I did some re=
search and found that no standard is being used for the use of "Single Bus"=
.  18 were "single buss", 8 were "single bus", 6 were "singlebus".  I have =
made the attached programming change to comply with Business Practice rule =
and I believe that Mark is going to send a notice to everybody that the rul=
e needs to be followed as written.    I apologize for the inconvenience, it=
 was not intentional.   We will accept all tags that properly use "Single B=
us".   Responses are graciously accepted. =20

Your last paragraph is right on man.  It just the commie business practice=
=20
that bites.=20

Again, my view of the world is that the transmission should be associated=
=20
with the sink control area - they are the one who takes it home.  The sourc=
e=20
control area shouldn't have the fake transmission.=20

Guess part of the problem is due to CAs not registering as TPs which would=
=20
make things much more consistent.=20

PSEI will take NOR, SINGLEBUS, GF (if we're not looking), MIDC-MIDC, and=20
other creative entries for the OASIS number for MIDC-MIDC transactions.=20

Subject: NOR Scheduling

It was requested that ETags that specify an OASIS reservation=20
as 'Single Bus' be treated the same as 'NOR' tags.  I have just=20
released a copy of SCHDOASIS that supports this.  The text=20
must exactly read 'Single Bus' (as stated in the rules).  Let me=20
know of any problems.
