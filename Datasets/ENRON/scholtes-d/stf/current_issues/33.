PacifiCorp Real-Time has recently been requested several times by PSE's to =
use their "Adjust" function for changing schedules.  This has prompted them=
 to ask for a clarification on the Adjust function "rules".  It is Real-Tim=
es belief that the Adjust function is for Control Area use and only for Rel=
iability/Curtailment issues.  If Merchants/PSE's want to change a schedule =
on an existing tag it should be done through the Termination/replaced funct=
ions at their control and not ask C/A's to use their Adjust function.  I ha=
ve found documentation that tells who has control of the Adjust function an=
d how it can be used but cannot find any documentation that specifically pr=
ohibits or limits it's use to C/A and/or their curtailment issues.  Does an=
ybody have any help here??  The main issue is, R/T does not have time to pe=
rform adjust functions for other entities merely at their request.   We can=
 understand doing it when the tag originator has lost control and is unable=
 to terminate a tag but not on a routine basis.
