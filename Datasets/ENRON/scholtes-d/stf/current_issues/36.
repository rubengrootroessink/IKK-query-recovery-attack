Please refer to EPMI tag # 27722.  On this tag I stacked transmission with different transmission providers.  The tag was implemented by each (CA)and (TP).  I recieved a call from PNM'S marketing group requesting that I cancel this implemented tag and re-submit it as 2 tags.  1 for each (TP).   It was actualy PNM's CA area and Trani group that had a problem with the tag.  PNM the marketer agreed that it would be o.k. to leave the tag since it had already been implemented and they would look into the issue further.  After speeking with Don Lacen who I believe represents PNM on the ISAS committe I was told that stacking tags with different trani providers was not industry standard and that they would prefer that I tag them seperatly in the future.  Until, an agreement is reached on this tagging process I agreed to tag seperately for each TP.  Please let me know if you know otherwise.  

Thanks,
