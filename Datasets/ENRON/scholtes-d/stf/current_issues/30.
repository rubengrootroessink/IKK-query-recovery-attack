Good Morning Diana,

I just spoke with Duong and we don't think it will be a huge issue for Enpower.  Here are my thoughts:

1.  Enpower stores dates & times in GMT.
2.  On each schedule strip, we identify the time zone.  Portland users usually select PPT.  Pacific Prevailing Time is smart enough to properly assign either PST or PDT depending on the date.  If the date falls on the long-day or short-day, Enpower will split the strip into 2 strips based on the time the deal flows.
3.  I am assuming that WSCC would standardize on PST.  We would just need to run a mass change SQL statement to convert all the PPT and PDT schedule strips to PST.  

Anyway, I'll be back in Portland on Friday.  Please let me know if you have any available time to discuss further.

Thanks,  David Poston

There's a survey being sent around to the WSCC ISAS group regarding a standardization of time.  The circumstances surrounding this survey involve the Day Ahead Scheduling process, timely Net Interchange checkouts between adjacent Control Areas, E-Tagging timelines for submission and assessment.  It comes back to a common time element for all parties to use in the above process and the elimination of the 23 and 25 hour days on the Daylight Saving changes.  Though the times on clock would change, the scheduling times would not.  It is thought that significant time, manpower and operating expense savings can be achieved by implementing a single scheduling time.  But to achieve this, what are the costs associated with implementation.  The area's obvious to me are 1.  Existing Contracts- How to implement these on a forward basis.  2.  Future EOL confirmation processes  3.  Enpower.  

There are no apparent transition issues for Scheduling.  In fact, this will eliminate some for them.  I need to know whether or not we would support this standardization, what the estimated costs associated with this if we do or don't make the change,  and what the implementation issues would be.  I'm sure I haven't covered some, so please forward this to the appropriate people.
