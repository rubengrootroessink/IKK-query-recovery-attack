All,

It is my understanding that transmission stacking was to be used when
aggregating multiple OASIS reservations from the same transmission provider
on a single tag.  The stacking of OASIS reservations in descending order of
priority works for a single xmn provider, and the tag author's use of the
descending stacking methodology can be verified by that transmission
provider.  Doesn't using multiple xmn providers eliminate this checking
mechanism?  Or is the idea of the transmission provider verifying the stack
order distasteful?

Finally, is allowing xmn stacking with multiple xmn providers the logical
extension of allowing xmn stacking with one provider?

et al:

I have a Preschedule Tag (implemented only for the day) that is raising
some eyebrows that needs to be up for discussion.

No. 14.. Business Practices- "Multiple transmission reservations or
grand fathered transmission contracts may use the "level" capability of
the e-tag.  The PSE should list their stacked transmission segments in
descending order of priority."

The reason this is causing some problems is due to the multiple
transmission providers.  All CA's and TP's approved the tag initially,
but then was rejected as a future tag.  I would propose having the
Business practice amended to allow the tag to display multiple
transmission providers.  On the original tag, the MW break-out was
clearly defined under the Reference field and also on the Comments
field.  It appears that all control areas also should be able to check
out with one another.
