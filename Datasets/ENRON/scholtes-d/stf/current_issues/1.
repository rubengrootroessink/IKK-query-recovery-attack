ISAS Members,

It appears that the first thing we need to do is to get the distribution
lists straightened out. I'll start working on that immediately.

Attached is the meeting information for those of you that didn't receive it.
Please make your hotel reservations prior to 1/25/02 to ensure you get the
room rate we secured.

Thanks.
