Well- Lisa and I finally finish the incorporation of the comments into the
BP document.  That document is the entitled "Majority Accepted BP for
WSCC_with_Comments.doc".  The document with no comments but the comments
incorporated is entitled "Majority Accepted BP for WSCC_Final.doc" and will
be the one submitted for the 30 day posting prior to my request for an OC
vote.  The last document is the "Final" one with the BP # 10 change, and is
to be submitted for 60 day due process.  That will be posted if OC approves
the "Final" documents.

With this all in mind, I am requesting by this email that the voting member
(and that who this email is going to) approve all three document for
disposition as I've described above.  The deadline for vote return will be
by opening of business on July 16, so that I may have a count to report at
the 17th meeting and to get closure.

Thanks in advance for you patience and help in getting this completed.
