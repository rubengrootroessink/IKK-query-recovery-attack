This is a REMINDER that the deadline for public comment to the 2nd
posting is Tuesday July 10, 2001.

June 27, 2001

On May 25, 2001, the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative posted 15
separate business practices documents for public comment.  While the
comments received were helpful, some important questions still remain.
The ESC is soliciting your input on specific questions regarding
business practices that are critical to Electronic Scheduling and OASIS
Phase II.  
This request is in lieu of a second posting of revised business
practices, which the ESC had scheduled for June 26, 2001. The questions
are concise and specific to a few practices; therefore, a more formal
posting is not needed and answers or comments to these questions are
requested by e-mail.  The comment period ends on July 10.  The ESC will
respond "in general" to the comments and post the comments and responses
to the Electronic Scheduling web site.  
The current proposed Business Practices will continue to be posted and
can be reviewed as reference to these questions.  Comments from the May
25, 2001 posting are now posted on the Electronic Scheduling web site.
The ESC is in the process of integrating the business practices into a
business model with rules demonstrating how the model works.  The
business model will be included in the third and final posting of
business practices on July 31, 2001.  The ESC will file business
practices with FERC on August 31, 2001.
Please respond by forwarding e-mail to monica.mulryan@nerc.com
<mailto:monica.mulryan@nerc.com>.  When commenting to this posting
