John,

As far as supplying ENA, there are opportunities to do deals immediately:  ENA continues to supply all of its in-the-money contracts by purchasing energy from counterparties on a pre-pay basis.  The contract is under the WSPP.  Call Mallory (3811) to sell in California, Crandall (3815) or Scholtes (3807) for NW, and Salisbury (3910) for SW.  If you have any legal questions, call Dale Rasmussen (8863).

Best, 

Steve
