Last Friday, Stewart Rosman and I met with Al Paschke, our BPA transmission rep.  During our meeting, Stewart and I discussed some concerns about BPA transmission such as load following service, 10-min dispatch for A/S, how BPA's decremental cost is calculated, control area reserves, and line losses.  He suggested we put together a list of transmission issues/requests for products that he could present to TBL on our behalf.  He said it would be more effective for us to give him a written document, as opposed to just having him relay our oral comments.  

Please send me any suggestions you have for improving TBL's services.  If you will provide me with something to start with, I would be happy to polish it up and include it with the rest of our issues.  

Obviously, TBL moves slowly so it is unlikely that any changes would happen immediately.  However, TBL has a one-year rate case every other year.  Next year is that year, so if we get our ideas in the hopper this year, we might see some of them in TBL's next rate proposal.
