Holli & Diana,

BPA is including Excess Federal Power and or Surplus Firm Power on their confirmations when BPA sells, however BPA is not including the special language that was faxed to us by Holli. Here are the following deal numbers:

EPMI		BPA		Excess Federal Power/Surplus Firm Power
648603		24291		Excess Federal
648423		24297		Excess Federal
654209		24302		Excess Federal
646739		31402		Surplus Firm Power
631718		24247		Excess Federal
644252		24266		Surplus Firm Power
637686		24258		Excess Federal

I have not sent these confirms signed back to BPA yet. Are these confirms o.k. for signature without the language, or do you want me to hold off until the issue is worked out with BPA?

Regards,

Kimberly
