Diana and Sean:

Please note that in addition to the -$870,820.56 prior month adjustments you've agreed in response to my prior email to you on 8/30, you will get +$6,594 for index price true up from deal #607801.  Therefore, the revised total adjustment you shall expect on 8/31/01's P&L is -$864,226.56.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Fran

Attached please find all prior month adjustments we've taken from April up to the end of July.  Please note that normally Risk only makes prior month adjustments at the end of each month, and I have tracked your p&l at the end of April, May, June, and July and all the month-to-date adjustments match what's showing up in the attached speadsheet.

In the mean time I have saved all June's P&L statements in "M:\common\Power\Riskmgmt\west temp" folder.  Please note this folder will be deleted when you are done reviewing, as all the P&L statements are highly confidential.

 

Please also note that although the Modesto annuities were entered in June and July they wouldn't go into your P&L on the dates the annuities were entered because the flow date for those deals were all for prior months (April, May, and June).  In other words, for deals entered with a flow date that's already passed, they will not go into your P&L unless Risk makes manual adjustments.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Fran

Fran,

I'm pretty sure I've already been hit for some of these.  If you could provide me a P&L copy from June 1 thru today (either electronic or paper) I'd appreciate it.

Sean and Diana:

Just wanna give you a heads up.  From Settlements we learned that there will be -$870,820.56 prior month adjustments in your book due to BPA and Modesto related deals .  I have researched on all the items and believe they are valid.  Please take a look and let me know if you have any questions or concerns.  If you don't disagree you shall expect to see this hit in your P&L for 8/31/01.

 << File: STNW PMA 083101.xls >> 

Please also note that there might be other items to come between now and the end of this month.  I will let you know when that happens.

Thanks,
Fran
