 <<10123AA1.doc>>  <<11046.doc>> Steve -- Here is a first cut at (1) an
amendment to the James River Agreement, and (2) the Book-Out Agreement.
These are in draft form and have not yet been reviewed internally, except by
Scott.  Please give me a call after you've had a chance to look these over.
Thanks -- Doug (503-230-3562)
