Diana,

I should have this ready for you sometime next week.  I have not received the appropriate sign-off from our legal department and our testing/mapping contact is out of the office until Monday.  Please feel free to contact me should you need further information.

Thanks,

Chris Walker

Chris,

This language looks good.  Is this going to be available for September 1?
