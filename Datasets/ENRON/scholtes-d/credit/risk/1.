Diana and Sean:

Attached please find the latest prior month adjuments to be entered in your P&L for 11/30/01.  The total amount will be 
-$1,616.76.  The biggest negative item (-$162,309.44) is explained by Settlements as due to "multiple deals DJ index settling" as you can see in the attached detail sheet.  I have asked Settlements to provide more details (deal numbers) so it might better help us understand where this negative adjustment is from.  I will send you the deal numbers as soon as I found out.

Please also note the attached file is preliminary.  There could be more to come from Settlements between now and month-end.  I'll update you if that happens.  Please take a look at the items listed now and let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you,
Fran
