Rick:  I have been working with Eric Gonzales (head of the LNG group) over the past few weeks on the attached comments.  There was a disagreement within the group as to what position to take, which took some time to hash out.  In any event, we are going to ask FERC to maintain jurisdiction and open access requirements with respect to LNG terminals.  The comments are attached, if you want to read them (they're only 2pages).

Lisa:  Attached is a revised draft that hopefully reflects the comments you just passed along.  Do you wish to further expand on the jurisdiction statement?
