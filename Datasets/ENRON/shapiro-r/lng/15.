They're very competitive with Enron.  Apparently Ken Randolph called Akin Gump and threatened to fire them as counsel unless they withdrew from the case.  Peter is full of himself - he fancies himself as being the Rick Shapiro of Dynegy.   No comparison in my opinion.  Not even close.  

My response to Mary was "go ahead - Ferc will see right through your comments and speculation as to the reasons behind our business decisions."  I also told her if she wanted to take the gloves off, be prepared for us to do the same.  And that we'd win.  She's a good enough friend that I could say that.  

I heard through my contacts that, absent someone raising the open access issue, FERC was inclined to grant Dynegy's request.  Our little 2 pager rocked their boat.

Agree- Dynegy is a very petty co.-maybe it's Peter?

Jim told me that Dynegy is peeved about Enron's comments in the LNG case.  They forced Akin Gump to remove their name as our counsel in the case (arguing that AG needed to seek a waiver since we're both clients).  Our comments are brief and as benign as possible.   It shows me that we did the right thing - the reason they are so upset is because they thought they had a done deal.   Their reaction is unprofessional and, frankly, pathetic. 

Mary (in their dc office) threatened to file a response that said " if Enron is so concerned about open access, why did they site their LNG plant in the Bahamas?"
