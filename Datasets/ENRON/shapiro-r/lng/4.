Ken Lay met with the Vice President last week for about 45 minutes to discuss 
the Administration's National Energy Policy.  During the discussion, Ken 
raised the importance of including LNG in its policy.  Ken emphasized that 
any national energy policy should encourage investment in infrastructure for 
natural gas and power, and said that at current gas prices in the US LNG 
imports are financially attractive.  Ken said that Enron is making a 
significant investment in global LNG business and much of this investment 
will be in the US and South America.  The Vice President, while not affirming 
our position, seem very receptive to the message.  As we were departing the 
White House, Ken saw Secretary Colin Powell.  Ken spoke to the Secretary 
about our LNG project and gave our LNG briefing paper to the Secretary.  We 
also followed up his discussion with a letter from Ken to Secretary Powell, 
thanking the Secretary for looking into the Venezuelan LNG project.
