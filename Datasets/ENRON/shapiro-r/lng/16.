Rick:

I wanted to let you know that there have been no protests (to date) in Enron's Calypso filing with FERC to build a pipeline from the Bahamas to Florida.  ETS has been providing regulatory assistance to the development team since this will likely be an ETS project.  I filed an intervention in support of the project on behalf of Enron LNG (a shipper on the system).   

I'll keep you posted.

Lisa
