Rick:

One new projects have been added tot he list of hot deals for June 1st.  
They--and their suggested action times--are as follows:

  Project  Originator  Description   
EWS
  Midway   Dave Duran  Investment in Peaking capacity in Florida ($277 
million).
Suggested Action Item: Communicate with SMontovano, and Marchris findings, 
and compile GA comments for RAC if any.  It is not clear at this stage 
whether this project shall replace Ft. Pierce which also aims at acquiring 
peaking capacity in Florida (same originator).  

Of course, please let me know if you have any question.
