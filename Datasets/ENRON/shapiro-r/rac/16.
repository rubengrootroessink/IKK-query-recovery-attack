Rick:

This is quick note to let you know that I shall work very closely with Lisa 
on Fireball project (see first project below).  While working in her group to 
provide the required regulatory due diligence, we shall also attempt to:  a) 
link the effort to RAC process (mainly through Dave Gorte), b) Find accurate 
measure to reflect the risk the Enron sees for GA reporting purposes (also 
measures for our contribution to the project).

Not only this project is important in terms of size ($750 million), but also 
in its activity (acquisition of coal company); it is an excellent opportunity 
to document the processes followed as they happen.    

I am grateful for Lisa's help and support.

Please let me know if you have any question.
