Attached for your review is the draft of Enron's response to the complaint of 
the National Association of Gas Consumers against "All Sellers of Natural Gas 
in the United States of America in Interstate Commerce".  The NAGC asks FERC 
to set a benchmark price for natural gas in the US of $2.74 with sales above 
that level being subject to refund for 3 years.

The deadline for filing is March 1.  If you have any comments on the draft, 
please respond by e-mail to both me and Leslie Lawner, or call one of us no 
later than 4:00 pm CST tomorrow.  My extension in Houston is 35840, and 
Leslie's phone number is 505-623-6778.
