Bet you  can guess what happened next=01(the Governor=01,s office lied and=
=20
stonewalled until  they couldn=01,t stand the pressure from the media.? So,=
 they=20
hastily prepared 24 of the 45  advisor=01,s statements (some incomplete, so=

very sloppily prepared =01) perjury,  anyone?) and made them available late=
 on=20
Thursday afternoon.?=20
