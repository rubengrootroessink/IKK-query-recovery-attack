Rick, thanks for the note. I will be in touch with you and Stefan Diescher on 
this. The issue I have been faced with, however, is 
simply this: I am covering power and gas for three countries on my own. The 
demands on my time have been enormous and I have given
Viviana as much of my time as possible. Indeed, at the last PRC, there was 
significant pressure to place her in the "has issues" category
and I resisted on the grounds that she needed more time to find her stride. 
We have had a number of long meetings where I have noted
in detail what my expectations are and provided her with suggestions on how 
to improve. This has included helping her outline a research paper
how to write a slide presentation, what research sources to go to, how to 
extract information from people on the phone. In a better world
I would spend more time with her to bring her along, but I am horribly 
stretched and need a researcher who is more effective to help
me get the job done. I have also gotten other feedback (including from the 
head of the Frankfurt office) that has been rather negative.
My view is that rather than prolong the mutual agony, we should begin the 
process of managing her out and helping her secure more
appropriate employment outside the firm. Please let me know what you think.
Thanks, Paul

I heard more about Viviana before I left London last week and apparently her 
concern she was'nt being properly guided or mentored- despite her apparent 
current performance and your  lack of time, I think we do owe her an action 
plan at mid-year at the latest and a decent opportunity to redeem herself. 
Please let me know how I can be of assistance. Thanks.
