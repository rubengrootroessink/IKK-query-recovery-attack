I should add to Paul D's explanation a footnote re help for Alfredo on Italy. 
I have agreed with Alfredo, Paul D, Paul Mead and Eric Shaw that Nailia 
Dindarova will spend approx. 30% of her time between now and the end of this 
year supporting Alfredo on Italian electricity market regulatory work. For 
this purpose Paul Mead will find a desk next to the Italian market traders 
for Nailia, and she will spend up to three days each week in London rather 
than Brussels over the six month period.

Thanks Paul for the feedback, Let's keep looking in the market.

Sounds fine to me.  I've followed up with Alfredo, Peter and Doug, re, David 
Gonzalez.  I think our preference would still be to keep David for another 
six months, while accepting that this does carry some risk in terms of 
employment rights issues.  David fills a valuable hole currently that it 
would be very difficult to plug in the short term.  That said, it will be 
made clear to David that this is a final renewal and that he may want to 
explore opportunities elsewhere within or outside of Enron.  Meanwhile, 
Alfredo is committed to using the six month period to recruiting someone 
permanent to help him out on Spanish and Italian issues.

Regards,

Paul

All,

I have interviewed Esther, twice, and on both occasions reccomended that we 
did not hire, so would not be supportive of moving her into the group as I do 
not believe she has either the capaiblity to communicate effectively in 
English or the business knowledge to make her useful to you.

Regards

Sophie

... I'm pretty clear that you will not have any vacancy suitable for Esther.
