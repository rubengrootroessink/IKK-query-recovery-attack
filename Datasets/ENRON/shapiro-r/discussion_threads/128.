Jim suggested  I provide you   a  brief  heads up  on a project underway for  
the  Enron Networks  group for  developing  a suite of products  called  
Commodity Logic.  Jim Whitehead  is the lead on the project  and  reports to 
Tom Gros.

I am preparing a Competitor Analysis of  135  B2B firms  that  offer already  
or are developing products  that compete with the  Commodity Logic  software  
products.  Our plan is to force  rank them  within  the  four product  
categories in development  by  Enron under the   Commodity Logic  brand.  We 
will analyze the competitors as possible sources of M&A opportunities and  of 
course, tracking the competitors customers gives us  possible  targets for  
the Commodity Logic  software. These products are initially  for the energy 
commodity business  but  are scalable and  for the future  envisioned to be 
applicable to many other commodities.
 The  attached mini-profile  describes  the 4 current  products.  Let me know 
if you have any questions  or need  any more information.
