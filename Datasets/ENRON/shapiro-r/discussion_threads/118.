Attached are the somewhat revised comments we plan to file tomorrow with the 
FERC in the docket revisiting the pipeline marketing affiliate rules.  Unlike 
some other parties, who have taken this opportunity to file very detailed 
comments, we are holding back at this point for several reasons.  This is 
very early on in the process, if the FERC decides more is needed, a NOI or 
NOPR will come out and we will have a lot more opportunity to address 
specific issues.  There is also a chance that the change of guard at FERC 
will kill this whole effort, or at least take in a different direction.   
Finally, we will participate at the conference on 1/31 and can respond the 
the issues and questions there. So look at this attachment and let me know 
what you think.  And Becky, can you add the certificate of service - it only 
needs to go to the Secretary.
