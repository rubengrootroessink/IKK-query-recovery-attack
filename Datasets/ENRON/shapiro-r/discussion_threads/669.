To EPSA's Public Affairs & State Issues Committees:

During our steering committee call this morning on the Powerful Future Media 
Campaign, the group reinforced a desire to move forward expeditiously with 
production of our campaign, while at the same time reaching out to other 
potential stakeholders to join us in some paid media education/advocacy 
regarding the lessons from California.

The group is currently reviewing some initial drafts, and it appears likely 
that we'll be able to take advantage of some already booked studio time next 
Tuesday.

It also was agreed that we shift our approach somewhat - away from targeted 
states and toward targeted markets, supplemented by some placements in 
national regulator/legislator publications to help us cover the loss of a few 
state capitals.

Although, the actual markets and their priority will be determined by the 
"phase two" funders and their available resources, the plan envisions 
placements in east coast markets from at least Boston through Washington, 
D.C., as well Seattle and Portland in the West.  Other markets could also be 
included as we go.  At this point, the group decided against any California 
placements.  The total estimated budget for these buys is similar to that 
previously distributed.

Still plenty of room on the bandwagon, so please give me a call if I can be 
of further assistance, (202) 628-8200, ext. 103.

Regards,
Mark S.
