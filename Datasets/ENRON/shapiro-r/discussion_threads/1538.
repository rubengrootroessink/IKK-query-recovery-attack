Paul - thanks for forwarding.

I don't know if this is material for Steve's meeting, but may be of interest 
to you anyway.
Given our increasing confidence that the Arcos capacity isssue is settled, 
John Sheriff & Michael Brown indicated that they may consider another 
regulatory battle in Europe, possibly on gas, and have asked Paul Hennemeyer 
& me to draw up a list of possible complaints.  As you know, Germany is 
probably our biggest problem area, but that may not mean this is the battle 
we want to fight first.
Significantly, the European Commission is losing patience with Germany.  I 
attended the European Gas Regulatory Forum in Madrid this week (consists of 
delegates from member states gas regulators, ministries, the Commission and 
groups representing Gas Transmission Enterprises, consumer groups, offshore 
gas producers, incumbent suppliers, European Federation of Energy Traders.  
The representative from the German ministry was unbelievably outspoken about 
refusing to agree that consensus had been reached on anything, and supported 
GTE's refusal to publish any information on available capacity, transparent 
terms of access.  They also refused to recognise that the Council of European 
Energy Regulators might have any authority over Germany as they had chosen to 
go down a different route.  Political patience is clearly running out and the 
Commission is considering how they might use powers under Article 86 to 
progress either the proposed acceleratino directive or a new directive on 
information disclosure, in spite of Germany.  (Brendan says they have already 
used these powers in telecomms).

Fighting hard on a number of EU, French, Dutch and Belgian fronts, but no 
definitive victories to report in last week.
