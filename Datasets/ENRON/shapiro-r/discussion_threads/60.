Subject: Re: Draft Questions for Hoecker =20

Tom--[[For your background information for Senator Gordon--you will need to=
=20
edit out the information on the part Enron played, but I thought you would=
=20
want the entire picture]].

 Until the Tennessee Power case issued in March, most utilities considered=
=20
interconnection issues and procedures to be within their discretion.  The=
=20
only FERC approved policies were in PJM and NEPOOL.  These policies are=20
fairly idiosyncratic to those pools.  Since Enron began siting merchant=20
generation with our 1999 peaking plants in TVA, we had told FERC that there=
=20
were problems in getting utilities to be responsive.  The main problem was=
=20
failure to provide study results in a timely manner.

 I think it is important to note that merchant facilities are a fairly new=
=20
idea.  They are not rate-based, and have no guaranteed return paid for=20
directly by retail customers (except perhaps to the extent that a utility=
=20
signs a deal to purchase capacity and/or energy from the merchant.)  Plus, =
I=20
think the utilities are incentivized under the current vertically integrate=
d=20
structure to benefit their own merchant plants or their utility plants (les=
s=20
supply).

? TENNESSEE POWER ORDER ON INTERCONNECTION POLICY -- FERC issued an order o=
n=20
3/15/00 clearly expressing its policy on interconnection issues.  The order=
=20
is significant because it was issued in large part due to the lobbying=20
efforts of EPMI and other generator members through Enron's membership in t=
he=20
Electric Power Supply Association ("EPSA"). =20

In mid-January, EPSA arranged all-day meetings for Sarah Novosel (Enron) an=
d=20
other EPSA members to meet with the FERC Commissioners and staff to discuss=
=20
interconnection issues.  Fourteen EPSA member-companies were represented at=
=20
these meetings, and we expressed to the Commissioners and FERC staff the=20
problems we are facing in our efforts to successfully negotiate=20
interconnection agreements with utilities.  We urged the Commission to, at =
a=20
minimum, develop procedures that will make requesting and negotiating=20
interconnection agreements less time consuming and more even-handed.  The=
=20
Commission had assumed that the procedures laid out in the pro forma tariff=
=20
for requesting transmission service also applied to requests for=20
interconnection, and they were surprised to learn that most utilities do no=
t=20
abide by the procedures for interconnection requests. =20

In the Tenn. Power order (that dealt with a complaint filed by Tennessee=20
Power Co. against Central Illinois, which FERC dismissed), FERC clarifies=
=20
that the pro forma tariff procedures established for transmission requests=
=20
apply equally to interconnection requests.  Furthermore, FERC states that a=
=20
utility may not require a generator to submit a request for transmission=20
service along with its request for interconnection service, stating that=20
these are separate services and should be treated separately by the utility=
. =20
(Many generators have found that utilities are requiring them to submit=20
transmission requests at the time they submit interconnection requests, and=
=20
then the utility insists on performing costly and time-consuming system=20
impact studies for the transmission service, even if the generator does not=
=20
want the transmission service).  By applying the pro forma tariff procedure=
s=20
to interconnection requests and by requiring utilities to accept=20
interconnection requests without transmission service requests, FERC is=20
eliminating many of the roadblocks currently encountered by generators in=
=20
attempting to obtain interconnection from utilities.  FERC also states that=
=20
if the parties to an interconnection agreement fail to agree on the rates,=
=20
terms or conditions of the interconnection, the transmission customer may=
=20
direct the utility to file within 30 days an unexecuted agreement with FERC=
. =20
FERC will then have 60 days to determine the just and reasonable rates, ter=
ms=20
and conditions for the interconnection service. =20

During the FERC agenda meeting on 3/15, Commissioner Massey was very please=
d=20
with the order and congratulated his colleagues on providing the industry=
=20
with needed guidance.  Commissioner Massey then encouraged utilities to eac=
h=20
develop their own standard interconnection agreement that applies to all=20
generators requesting interconnection service, and he also encouraged the=
=20
industry to work together to develop an industry-wide pro forma=20
interconnection agreement.  EPMI has been working with EPSA on a pro forma=
=20
interconnection agreement, so Commissioner Massey's comments could encourag=
e=20
the utility sector to begin negotiating an industry-wide standardized=20
agreement.  However, even without a standardized agreement, we hoped that=
=20
FERC's order will help remove many of the obstacles currently used by=20
utilities to delay (sometimes indefinitely) the citing of new generation.

? TECO HOURLY IMBALANCE FILING -- TECO made a FERC filing to require minute=
=20
by minute balancing for generators that interconnect to the transmission=20
system.  EPMI protested through EPSA and asked for hourly balancing.  Befor=
e=20
an order was issued (somewhat unprecedented behavior before FERC), TECO=20
withdrew its minute filing and refiled for hourly imbalance calculations. =
=20
 At this time, FERC has not accepted requests by EPSA and others to create =
a=20
"standard" generator imbalance schedule for the OATT.  FERC has said it wou=
ld=20
review the filings on a case by case basis.  FERC has not required utilitie=
s=20
to file imbalance schedules -- it "encourages" them to do so.  At this time=
,=20
only Entergy, SOCO, TECO and several other utilities have filed imbalance=
=20
provisions as amendments to their OATTs.  Most utilities require this to be=
=20
"negotiated" (not much room for negotiation) in the interconnection=20
agreements.
 While FERC requires interconnection agreements to be filed at FERC and the=
y=20
can be filed "unsigned," and then protested, this can be an impractical=20
solution when building a peaker in less than one year, such as Enron has=20
done.  A merchant power producer is more likely to move the project to a mo=
re=20
friendly utility forum or accept some provisions that may be somewhat onero=
us=20
in order to site and build the plant for summer start dates.

? ENTERGY INTERCONNECTION FILING =01) On 3/1/00, Entergy filed a proposed=
=20
interconnection policy and procedure at FERC.  EPMI protested various aspec=
ts=20
and we assisted EPSA on its protest.  Before the order was issued (again=20
fairly unprecedented), Entergy agreed to make certain changes to its propos=
ed=20
interconnection procedure and interconnection agreement in response to=20
protests.  (Entergy asked FERC to delay an order until it could make this=
=20
filing.)=20

Entergy agreed to change:

Defines "required" system upgrades as those required to simply interconnect=
. =20
(EPMI and EPSA issue).  ("Required" are those such as resulting from the=20
Short Circuit/Breaker Rating Analysis and Transient Stability Analysis--lik=
e=20
circuit breakers, relaying devices, system protection equipment.)

Customers are not required to supply reactive power except when "in service=
"=20
(did not go as far as EPMI argued -- that we should not be required to=20
provide it or should receive the cost of our liquidated damages if we have =
to=20
cut our deal.  Entergy said it will pass through amounts it receives.)

Adopted EPMI's proposed "Emergency" language that loss of Entergy's=20
generation and inability to meet its load requirements is not an Emergency.

Agreed that Entergy cannot interrupt generator for "non-emergencies" except=
=20
when "complying with reliability protocols or procedures established by NER=
C=20
or SERC or reg. agency (EPMI issue).

Changed force majeure language to match OATT.

Entergy also states that it will not include generators in Short=20
Circuit/Breaker Analysis and Transient Stability Analysis until an=20
interconnection agreement is signed, although the generation projects will=
=20
remain in the queue.  This can cause the costs to vary from the 1st estimat=
e=20
to time of actual interconnection.

On 5/18/00, FERC issued an order accepting Entergy's pro forma=20
interconnection agreement ("IA") and procedures subject to modification.  A=
s=20
I mentioned above, Entergy had adopted some of EPMI's suggestion (in EPMI's=
=20
comments), including limiting emergencies to not include Entergy's loss of=
=20
generation.

All transmission must be separately arranged through OASIS -- it is not=20
included with an interconnection request.
Entergy's interconnection policy will apply to generators that will serve=
=20
wholesale, as well as unbundled retail.
Dismisses EPSA's call for a "model" and approves Entergy's pro forma=20
interconnection agreement, subject to modification.((The Commission stated=
=20
"EPSA, Dynegy, and PG&E argue that the Commission should initiate a generic=
=20
proceeding or industry collaborative to address interconnection=20
concerns....The Commission declines at this time to issue a policy statemen=
t=20
or convene a industry collarboration to establish standardized IPs=20
(Interconnection Procedures) and IAs (Interconnection Agreements).  With=20
respect to IPs, the Commission's recent findings in Tenn. Power amplify the=
=20
Commission's findings in Order No. 888, which established standard procedur=
es=20
for obtaining transmission service.  It is our belief that no additional=20
standardized procedures are necessary at this time.  We do, however,=20
encourage utilities to do as Entergy has done here and revise their OATTs t=
o=20
include procedures for requesting interconnection services and the criteria=
=20
for evaluating those requests.  Because an RTO will administer its pro form=
a=20
tariff, it is our hope that compliance with our RTO rulemaking will elimina=
te=20
concerns about interconnection procedures." at p. 10.)
Agreed with EPMI that billing disputes should be placed in escrow, not paid=
=20
to Entergy subject to refund (FERC said that the IA should conform to other=
=20
aspects of the Order No. 888 tariff--for example, Entergy and customer are=
=20
responsible for their own negligence).
Holds that all other terms of the Order No. 888 pro forma tariff apply to t=
he=20
IA, even if  the IA does not repeat all those provisions.
Clarifies Tenn. Power case that if a generator connects first and another=
=20
generator subsequently connects in the same local area and the grid cannot=
=20
accommodate "receipt" of power without expansion, the new generator must pa=
y=20
costs of expansion.
Entergy is required to revise IA to make distinction as to which provisions=
=20
are pure "interconnection" and which are applicable when=20
transmission/delivery is also requested (on OASIS).
Entergy is required to attempt to complete the interconnection studies in a=
=20
specific timeline (60 days for 1st iteration --system impact), and to provi=
de=20
a statement that Entergy will notify applicant of any delay with an=20
explanation for the delay (Entergy had included no timelines).
If applicant and Entergy cannot agree on IA terms, Entergy must file the=20
unexecuted agreement at FERC for FERC to decide.
Approves Entergy's credits for "optional" upgrades (required to transport=
=20
power away from the plant), but requires Entergy to file an explanation of=
=20
how the credits work.
Entergy will only include prior queued interconnection requests in subseque=
nt=20
studies once they have signed an interconnection agreement (to show more=20
intent to actually complete the project).  This does not mean that failure =
to=20
execute an IA results in removal from the queue, just that the generator ma=
y=20
be subject to different actual interconnection costs when it connects.  Thi=
s=20
is a risk that FERC says is inherent in interconnection.  Entergy will also=
=20
post its queue on OASIS.
Reactive power must only be supplied when generator is operating.
Per EPMI=01,s comments, Entergy cannot keep the initial $10,000 deposit, un=
less=20
actual costs are $10,000 or greater (generator must pay actual costs of=20
studies).
Per EPMI's comments, Entergy must pay for energy taken during an emergency=
=20
(or explain why that is inappropriate).
Per EPMI's comments, Entergy must explain the requirement that the generato=
r=20
pays for subsequent changes to Entergy's transmission system.

 ComEd Interconnection procedures -- On 3/6/00, ComEd filed interconnection=
=20
procedures.  Enron's comments were included in EPSA's protest on the=20
following issues. Proposed procedures:

1.  Submit valid request to interconnect (include # of generating units,=20
proposed max MW capacity and MVA, specific location, operational date).  Da=
te=20
and time of receipt by ComEd establishes queue position.  This info will be=
=20
posted on OASIS within 15 days (without listing the applicant's name).

2.  Within 30 days of the request, LOI will be tendered.  Applicant has 30=
=20
days to respond or lose queue position.  LOI authorizes commencement of=20
engineering work.

3.  Within 45 days of LOI, ComEd will perform an Interconnection Study with=
 a=20
project diagram.  Study assumes interconnection of all "competing" requests=
=20
(that ask for a location that affects your interconnection costs) that have=
=20
prior queue dates.

4.  Within 30 of receiving the interconnection study, Applicant must decide=
=20
whether to proceed.

5.  After Applicant decides to proceed, Applicant may have a maximum of 90=
=20
days for a ROFR against lower priority requests and to begin negotiating an=
=20
Interconnection Agreement.  Although somewhat unclear, if there is a=20
"competing" request, Applicant must exercise its ROFR within 15 days by=20
notifying ComEd of the desire to begin negotiating an interconnection=20
agreement.  If Applicant doesn't negotiate an IA-- lose queue spot.

6.  Once IA negotiations begin, Applicant has 90 days to execute it (or=20
submit dispute to arbitration).

7.  Before ComEd does inititates construction or installation of facilities=
,=20
IA must be executed.  (if generator is to come on line in < 1 year, ComEd=
=20
will negotiate an agreement (with appropriate financial safeguards) to=20
proceed before execution of the IA.)

8.  ComEd will include "reasonable milestones" that must be met in order to=
=20
maintain queue position.

My specific comments for comment:

Some items are unclear.  (1) Whether the "Decision" to proceed is made in=
=20
writing (which it should be); (2) The entire ROFR procedure (does it become=
 a=20
race to see who executes an IA faster?)
The 90 day IA execution period is now inconsistent with FERC's new statemen=
t=20
in Tenn. Power  (30 days).
If ComEd won't start work until after the IA is executed, then the 30 days=
=20
needs to be adhered to (otherwise, the timetable seems too long before work=
=20
begins).
Milestones need to be specified (the current proposal contains "may" includ=
e=20
milestones, and "may" include the following...)  Also, ComEd wants to=20
"reasonably extend" the milestones.  This must be done on a=20
non-discriminatory basis.
ComEd allows itself 45 days to complete the Interconnection Study and this=
=20
can be extended in ComEd's "sole judgment."  I disagree and think it should=
=20
only be extended if ComEd provides a reasonable explanation to FERC (simila=
r=20
to the pro forma procedures now in section 19.3 re: system impact studies).

On 4/26/00, FERC issued an order that again declined to initiate a generic=
=20
interconnection proceeding, but "encouraged" utilities to revise OATTs to=
=20
include interconnection procedures.  FERC also stated that the timelines in=
=20
the OATT for transmission system impact studies (60 days) and facilities=20
studies (60 days) are applicable to interconnection studies and that ComEd =
is=20
required to provide an explanation for any delays past these deadlines.  FE=
RC=20
required ComEd to change some other procedures identified by the EPSA prote=
st.


? FERC ORDER ON AEP=01,S INTERCONNECTION POLICY =01) On 6/29, FERC issued a=
n order=20
on AEP's proposed interconnection procedures.  EPMI participated in comment=
s=20
through EPSA.  While FERC largely reiterated its recent orders on Tenn Powe=
r=20
and Entergy interconnection procedure, there are several items of interest:

AEP said that it had a backlog of interconnection requests and needed more=
=20
than 60 days to complete the System Impact Study.  FERC held that AEP must=
=20
commit to completing the SIS within 60 days (consistent with the pro forma=
=20
tariff), but if AEP determines it needs more than 60 days, it is required t=
o=20
notify the customer with the reasons for the delay.  FERC further stated, "=
We=20
expect AEP to dedicate sufficient resources to these interconnection reques=
ts=20
to eliminate its backlog."

FERC rejected AEP's proposal to only provide transmission credits for "firm=
"=20
transmission (to a customer that is required to pay for system upgrades). =
=20
FERC said credits must apply to firm PTP, non-firm PTP, or network.

Allows AEP discretion on hiring third party contractors (since AEP would ha=
ve=20
to spend time educating the third party contractors); however, FERC=20
reiterates that AEP must eliminate its backlog.


? SPP Interconnection procedures  -- In 7/00, SPP filed clarifications to i=
ts=20
interconnection procedures recently filed at FERC.  EPMI participated in=20
EPSA's protest that the System Impact Study should be completed in 60 days=
=20
(or SPP should provide an explanation for the delay), instead of the 90 day=
s=20
requested by SPP.  SPP has agreed to this change (which is also consistent=
=20
with FERC's recent order on AEP's interconnection procedures.)  Also, it=20
appeared that SPP wanted the Interconnection Agreement to be executed withi=
n=20
15 days, which is close to physically impossible, especially when SPP has n=
o=20
pro forma IA.  SPP agreed to 60 days.

 CP&L interconnection procedures -- Most recently, CP&L filed interconnecti=
on=20
procedures that ask for a 90 day study period despite the FERC orders in AE=
P=20
and SPP stating that the deadlines are 60 days.  EPSA protested with yet=20
another appeal to FERC to standardize these procedures.  FERC has not issue=
d=20
an order. =20

 The lack of standardized procedures has become problematic in just the few=
=20
months since Entergy's procedures were filed.  We are required to constantl=
y=20
monitor the notices for any procedures that have been filed, then check eac=
h=20
one carefully to determine how it deviates from the Commission's orders in=
=20
other cases.  The utilities are not required to point this out in their=20
filings (ie, no redlining from an OATT, which is required in transmission=
=20
OATT changes.)
