You were quite right on the topic of gas prices in California. I looked
through some articles I have been collecting that make reference to an
investigation by the FERC into alleged market manipulation by El Paso Corp
in the context of the price basis between San Juan and Topock. You probably
know all this already, but I attach an article that was in the FT yesterday.
