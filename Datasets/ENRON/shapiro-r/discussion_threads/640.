As mentioned in a separate email, visits to the EJ website peaked last Friday 
at 3,766, the day we placed the Brattle paper on the website. The two 
attached graphs show site visits on a monthly basis and page hits last week. 
The vast majority of visits on Friday were to the Japanese version of the 
Brattle paper.
