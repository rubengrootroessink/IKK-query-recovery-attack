APPROPRIATIONS
With Few Exceptions, House Approps Panels To Follow Bush Lead
   The House Appropriations Committee has developed subcommittee
spending allocations for FY02. While essentially in line with
President Bush's requests, they differ in some cases by billions
of dollars. In allocations being released today, House
appropriators are recommending $3 billion more than Bush wanted
for Labor-HHS, $1.1 billion more for VA-HUD and $1.2 billion more
for Energy and Water.
   The so-called 302(b) allocations, which the Appropriations
Committee should mark up by next week, divide the $661.3 billion
set aside in the budget resolution for total discretionary
appropriations among the 13 Appropriations subcommittees. The
proposed subcommittee allocations in the budget Bush submitted in
April, however, were based on his request that total FY02
spending be kept to $660.6 billion.
   The expected allocations are listed below by subcommittee. All
numbers are expressed in budget authority, followed by the Bush
administration proposal:
   Agriculture: $15.5 billion, compared to the Bush proposal of
$15.4 billion. Commerce-Justice-State: $38.5 billion, compared to
$37.9 billion. Defense: $300.3 billion, $301 billion. District of
Columbia: $380 million, $300 million.
   Energy and Water: $23.7 billion, $22.5 billion. Foreign
Operations: $15.2 billion, the same as Bush proposed. Interior:
$18.9 billion, $18.1 billion. Labor-HHS: $119.7 billion, $116.4
billion.
   Legislative Branch: $2.9 billion, $3 billion. Military
Construction: $10.2 billion, $9.6 billion. Transportation: $14.9
billion, $16.2 billion. Treasury-Postal: $16.9 billion, $16.6
billion. VA-HUD: $84.2 billion, $83.1 billion.
   Meanwhile, on the FY01 front, House Appropriations Chairman
Young and Defense Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Jerry
Lewis, R-Calif., both said Thursday that they intend to stick to
the president's supplemental appropriations recommendation,
despite rumblings from some defense hawks that the Bush
administration's nearly $7 billion FY01 supplemental spending
request shortchanges the military.
   The supplemental would provide a total of  $6.1 billion for
defense, partially offset by $505 million in defense cuts.
   House Armed Services Military Readiness Subcommittee Chairman
Curt Weldon, R-Pa., called the request "totally inadequate,"
saying the needs are at least $10-15 billion.  Congress ought to
provide more money using an emergency designation, he said.
   But constrained by the budget caps and the administration's
admonitions to Congress not to abuse the emergency designation,
Young and Lewis said they plan to keep the supplemental to the
president's requested level.
   "We've got to be in the real world," said Lewis.
   The emergency designation allows money to be appropriated but
not counted against the cap.
   Lewis added that he is aiming for a full committee markup as
early as next week and conference with the Senate by July 4th.
   Should Congress add substantially to the supplemental, Chief
Deputy Majority Whip Roy Blunt, R-Mo., one of the
administration's allies on the Hill, said the president would be
eager to show his commitment to fiscal discipline with a veto.
   "The president won't be hesitant to veto an early bill," Blunt
said. "I think they're looking for an early opportunity to show
their commitment to discipline on spending. I wouldn't be at all
surprised, if we gave them the opportunity with the supplemental,
[to see a veto]."
   In the Senate, where OMB Director Daniels met briefly Thursday
with Appropriations Chairman Byrd and ranking member Ted Stevens,
R-Alaska, a senior Senate aide predicted the Senate also would
stick with the president's overall number on the supplemental.
   Daniels, who has insisted that the FY01 supplemental be kept
to "true current-year needs" and stay within the budget caps,
defended the supplemental as it was submitted to Congress.
   "I think Congress is going to see that these items are about
the right ones," Daniels said. -- By Lisa Caruso

HOUSE LEADERSHIP
Senate Storm Only A Drizzle In House
   Despite Minority Leader Gephardt's plea this week for a new
era of bipartisan collaboration, the Democratic takeover of the
Senate is unlikely to have much impact on partisan relations in
the House, according to House Republican leaders with close ties
to the Bush White House.
   In fact, one key leader, House Chief Deputy Majority Whip Roy
Blunt, R-Mo., said House Republicans feel liberated to pass
legislation more to their liking.
   "Those of us on the House side feel we have an increased
opportunity to get our work done without having to give
overwhelming consideration to how it impacts the Senate," Blunt
said. "Not that we won't be considerate, but there won't be
overwhelming consideration. Previously, we held back on some
things in consideration of Senator Lott's challenges."
   Blunt, who is a key liaison between congressional Republicans
and the White House, said he expected the House to pass an energy
bill, a prescription drug benefit, a campaign finance reform
measure--and perhaps legislation to make permanent this year's
package of tax cuts--all before the August recess.
   "These will all be placed on Mr. Daschle's desk before we go
home for the August break," Blunt said, suggesting the pressure
will be on the Senate Democratic leadership to come to terms with
bills backed by the House and President Bush.
   House Speaker Hastert sketched out a similar agenda for the
balance of the year in an interview Thursday--mentioning energy,
prescription drugs and campaign finance reform as well as a
patients' bill of rights and renewal of presidential trade
negotiating authority as top priorities.
   He also spoke favorably about a cost-of-living increase for
members of Congress, a subject he discussed earlier in the day
with Gephardt. Lawmakers "ought to be able to keep up with the
cost of living so that they can take care of their families and
provide for their families like everybody else does,'' Hastert
said. "I think that's the decent thing to do.''
   Rep. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, who chairs House GOP leadership
meetings, told CongressDaily that the most tangible difference
since Sen. James Jeffords, I-Vt., decided last month to bolt the
Republican Party was "a little more sensitivity by the White
House and our leadership in reaching out to moderates...Where you
might see a little change is the sensitivity to the fact that we
are a diverse party and we need to listen to both wings."
   Gephardt said this week that Jeffords' move could "embolden"
GOP moderates in the House to work with Democrats.
   But Portman, who served in the administration of Bush's father
and has strong ties to the current White House, noted that
moderate GOP Rep. Deborah Pryce of Ohio already serves in the
elected leadership as Conference secretary.  And Rep. Doug Ose,
R-Calif., serves as a liaison from the moderate wing to the GOP
leadership.
   "We've already formalized something that the Senate
[Republicans] are just now formalizing," Portman said in
reference to the appointment of Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., as the
moderates' representative within leadership. Portman did not
indicate that any new approach to the House Democratic leadership
was imminent.
   In the two weeks since Jeffords' switch, House Republican
moderates have praised Hastert's leadership of and played down
any tensions within their Conference.
   Rep. Michael Castle, R-Del., for example, said he thought the
Senate switch ultimately would allow Bush to play to his strength
as a master of compromise--but, in the meantime, expressed
confidence in the way House GOP leaders were handling the agenda.
   "Our moderates went to Jeffords and their message was, `Our
views are being taken into consideration,'" Blunt said, pointing
to efforts by Reps. Christopher Shays and Nancy Johnson of
Connecticut, among others, to persuade Jeffords to stay put.
   Gephardt this week said he stood "with olive branches in both
hands," but that the House Republican leadership has stiff-armed
Democrats at both the leadership and committee levels.
   "Civility has been improved, but we haven't had real
bipartisanship," Gephardt told reporters.
   House Republicans did not exactly thrash Gephardt with those
olive branches, but they did make clear that they have a
different definition of bipartisanship.
   "Look at the number of bipartisan meetings we held over the
first six months [of 2001]," said one White House aide, who noted
that Karl Rove, Bush's top political adviser, has been keeping
score of all the meetings with Democrats. "Clinton's numbers [of
meetings with Republicans] just pale in comparison....We did a
lot to advance bipartisanship over the first six months and we'll
just keep on doing it."
   Portman said: "I don't buy [Gephardt's] premise. The two most
important bills, education and taxes, were not rammed through on
party-line votes."
   But a source close to the Blue Dog Coalition of conservative
House Democrats reiterated that group's complaint that
Republicans have refused to consult with them on the development
of legislation.
   The Blue Dog source said the House GOP leadership already has
made clear that it will not pursue a more cooperative strategy.
   A House Democratic leadership source said: "It's been clear
for a long time that the Republican leadership has never showed
any interest in bipartisan cooperation. It may take them awhile
to come around."
   The source said the problem extended to the other end of
Pennsylvania Avenue, as well, declaring, "The president has given
Democrats and moderates pats on the back and nicknames, and he's
given conservative Republicans a tax cut and the Justice
Department." -- By Charlie Mitchell

HOUSE RACES
Largent Will Resign From House, Calls For Early Special Election
   Setting the stage for the House's seventh special election
this year, Republican Rep. Steve Largent announced Thursday that
he will resign his Tulsa-based 1st District seat in November to
concentrate on his race for Oklahoma governor.
   "It is my opinion that the race for governor will become a
full-time endeavor in the months ahead," Largent said.
"Therefore, today I announce my plan to resign ... on Nov. 29,
exactly seven years to the day I was first sworn into Congress."
   Largent called on the state Legislature and GOP Gov. Frank
Keating to pass a law in the Legislature's upcoming special
session, to schedule a special election before Largent's
effective resignation date.
   "I will make such a request in writing soon to encourage them
to allow the election to take place prior to my actual
resignation, as was done in 1994 with [former Democratic Sen.]
David Boren's departure from the U.S. Senate," Largent said.
   "This action would ensure that the 1st District is never
without representation in Washington," Largent said.
   Largent, formerly a record-setting wide receiver for the
Seattle Seahawks, entered the House when GOP Sen. James Inhofe
resigned the House seat to assume Boren's Senate seat.
   During his tenure, Largent has earned a reputation as a
champion of Christian conservative causes. He has occasionally
bucked his party's leadership and supported the 1997 coup attempt
against former House Speaker Gingrich. He unsuccessfully
challenged House Majority Leader Armey in 1998.
   In his resignation announcement, Largent said he would remain
neutral in the GOP primary, which already has grown contentious
in anticipation of Largent's gubernatorial run.
   The Republican field for Largent's seat includes state Rep.
John Sullivan, state Sen. Scott Pruitt and Oklahoma First Lady
Cathy Keating, the wife of the Republican governor, whose term is
up in 2002.

   National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Tom Davis
of Virginia Thursday called the seat "strongly Republican,"
noting that Largent never had received less than 62 percent of
the vote in the district.
   Nonetheless, at least two Democrats have considered entering
the race.
   Tulsa School Board member Doug Dodd appears to be the likely
Democratic nominee, while former Tulsa County Democratic Party
leader Tim Gilpin does not appear inclined to run.
   Oklahoma Democratic Chairman Jay Parmley said Oklahoma
Democrats would have to work hard to convince national Democrats
they can win the seat, but he was confident about the prospects.
   "That seat is competitive for Democrats," Parmley said. "Make
no mistake about it."
   During the 107th Congress, the deaths of Reps. Julian Dixon,
D-Calif., Norman Sisisky, D-Va., and Joe Moakley, D-Mass., have
necessitated special elections.
   Largent joins former Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Pa., and Rep. Joe
Scarborough, R-Fla., in retirement announcements.
   Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., also is expected to resign his
seat to accept a position in the Bush administration (see related
article, below). -- By Mark Wegner

JUDICIARY
Hutchinson's Promotion May Suspend Liability Legislation
   The impending departure of Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., whose
nomination to head the Drug Enforcement Administration is
expected to be confirmed by the Senate, has left the business
community scrambling to find a new champion for a comprehensive
bill to limit legal liability for business.
   Hutchinson is the chief House sponsor of legislation backed by
the National Federation of Independent Business and the National
Association of Wholesalers. It would cap punitive damages for
small businesses and for product sellers.
   Introduced last month, the bill restricts punitive damages
against businesses with fewer than 25 employees and limits awards
to three times the total amount awarded for economic damages or
$250,000, whichever is less.
   Sens. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., and Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.,
are sponsors of a similar bill in the Senate. However, the loss
of Hutchinson, a high-profile member of the House Judiciary
Committee and a visible spokesman for legal reform, is a blow for
bill proponents, observers said this week.
   And the loss is even more significant, they say, given the
shift in power to Senate Democrats and its likely implications
for legal reform legislation in general.
   The task of gathering the votes to secure cloture for the most
viable of the pending legal reform measures--on product liability
and class action reform--was considered daunting in a closely
divided Senate. But with Democrats controlling the agenda,
numerous sources have surmised that securing either hearing
commitments or floor time in that chamber may be nearly
impossible.
   At the same time, some observers noted, the bipartisan appeal
of the small business community--combined with President Bush's
expected effort later in his term to advance his civil-justice
reform agenda--could help move the ball on some piecemeal
reforms.
   This is not the first time this year that supporters of
product liability legislation have had to hunt for congressional
sponsors: The legislation's sponsors in the past Congress
included former Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif., and former Sens. John
Ashcroft, R-Mo., and Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., all of whom lost
their 2000 re-election bids. -- By Pamela Barnett

LABOR
GOP Praises Chao On Ergonomics Forums; Dems Seek New Rule
   House Education and the Workforce Chairman Boehner and
Workforce Protections Subcommittee Chairman Charlie Norwood, R-
Ga., praised Labor Secretary Chao's decision to hold three public
forums on ergonomics next month and develop a course of action by
September.
   "We know Secretary Chao will use these hearings to search for
a consensus approach that protects workers without jeopardizing
their jobs or placing America's economy in an ill-conceived
regulatory straightjacket," they said in a joint statement.
   "We are bringing everyone to the table to get this important
issue moving forward and resolved," Chao said Thursday.
   But Democrats were more circumspect.
   "We hope this is not just the policy of procrastination--
that's what we want to avoid," said John Lawrence, minority staff
director of the House Education and the Workforce Committee. "If
it's the first step to getting to a rule, then we welcome it."
   Ranking member George Miller, D-Calif., and Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass., sent a letter to Chao in April, urging her to
issue a new rule. But Chao has not committed herself to doing so.
   After Congress voted in March to eviscerate the Clinton
administration ergonomics rules, which would have required
employers to prevent and compensate employees who experienced
problems such as repetitive-stress disorders, Chao promised to
review them and issued a set of guiding principles on the issue.
   The principles that Chao says ergonomics action should be
based on are: prevention, sound science, incentive-driven,
flexibility, feasibility and clarity.
   A strong advocate of the Clinton rule, the AFL-CIO is
"analyzing the recent announcement" and will "respond in the very
near future," said Jay Power, the union's legislative
representative.
   Manufacturers, who opposed the Clinton rule, have said in the
past that they would welcome the opportunity to revisit the
issue.
   The forums will be held in Washington July 16, Illinois July
20 and California July 24. -- By April Fulton

HEALTH
FDA Officials Issue Public Safety Warning On Mailed Drugs
   As legislators in the House and Senate gear up for another
attempt to relax a 1988 law that bars the reimportation of U.S.-
made prescription drugs, federal officials told a House Commerce
subcommittee that the volume of drugs being sent through the mail
has already overwhelmed their ability to ensure the public's
safety.
   "We estimate that approximately two million parcels containing
FDA-regulated products for personal use enter the U.S. each year
through international mail facilities that Customs could set
aside for FDA review for possible violations" of law, FDA Senior
Associate Commissioner for Policy William Hubbard told the House
Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee.
   Because that is far more than FDA officials can inspect,
Hubbard testified, "the tens of thousands of parcels that FDA
does not review are eventually released by Customs and sent on to
their addresses," despite potential risks.
   Hubbard's testimony included the agency's strongest language
yet about what it perceives as the serious public health risk of
individuals using the Internet or other means to purchase
prescription drugs from overseas. Such drugs, he said, "may be
contaminated, subpotent, superpotent or counterfeit."
   "FDA and the public do not have any assurance that unapproved
products are effective or safe, or have been produced under U.S.
good manufacturing practices," he testified. "U.S.-made drugs
that are reimported may not have been stored under proper
conditions, or may not be the real product, because the [United
States] does not regulate foreign distributors or pharmacies."
   In a pilot project in California earlier this year, FDA
examined approximately 1,900 of some 16,000 packages flagged as
suspicious by Customs officials. Hubbard testified that some of
those packages contained drugs that could not be identified,
drugs with labeling only in foreign languages, and drugs that
have been specifically rejected for approval in the United States
by the FDA.
   "Several shipments contained three drugs that were once
approved by FDA but have been withdrawn from the market based on
serious safety concerns," he testified.
   Republicans and Democrats on the subcommittee were united in
their outrage over the situation.
   For sellers of such dangerous products over the Internet, said
Subcommittee Chairman Jim Greenwood, R-Pa., "Their motto might
very well be `there's a sucker logging on every minute.'"
   Last month, Greenwood, subcommittee ranking member Peter
Deutsch, D-Fla., and Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Mich., toured the
international mail facility at Dulles Airport, and "what we found
was truly frightening," Greenwood said, including pills hidden in
carbon paper in a failed attempt to evade detection.
   Energy and Commerce ranking member John Dingell, D-Mich.,
whose investigations as head of the oversight committee led to
the 1988 law making reimportation illegal, said the new
information shows that regulation needs to be tightened rather
than loosened.
   But while Dingell called last year's legislative attempt to
overturn the 1988 law a "misguided effort to attempt to lower
prices by opening up our borders," he said Congress must
recognize that individuals are turning to foreign drugs because
they cannot afford to buy them in the United States. -- By Julie

HEALTH
Bilirakis Panel `Open-Minded' On Addressing Generic Drug Law
   Although some members of Congress and the brand-name
pharmaceutical companies are skeptical, the House Energy and
Commerce Committee is keeping its options open to add drug patent
reform to a Medicare prescription drug bill that it is drafting
as a way to save money.
   "We do feel we should learn enough about them [the generic
drug issues]; that's why we're having the hearing next week,"
said House Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee Chairman
Michael Bilirakis, R-Fla.
   The committee is holding a Wednesday hearing on drug issues
and hopes to have the outline of its prescription drug bill plan
"in the next few days" following the hearing, he said.
   "We're trying to stay open-minded," Bilirakis said.
   But Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., said he worries about opening
up the 1984 drug patent law he wrote with Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-
Utah, particularly in the context of a broader Medicare
prescription drug bill.
   "It's not a natural fit," Waxman said.
   However, Waxman said the law might have some problems that
should be addressed.
   These include a 30-month stay that prevents generic products
from coming to market if a brand-name company claims a patent
infringement, and the 180-day period during which the first
producer of a generic drug on the market can prevent others from
competing with it.
   Hatch and Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., now the chairman of
the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, where the
issue could pop up on the Senate side, have expressed
reservations about opening the bill in the past.
   The brand-name drug industry has not shown much interest in
revamping the Hatch/Waxman law, but the generic drug companies
argue they are being unfairly barred from the market through
patent challenges.
   But brand-name advocates are bracing for a fight against any
such move. A spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America said it "would only jeopardize
prescription drug coverage for seniors."
   Sens. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. and John McCain, R-Ariz., and
Reps. Jo Ann Emerson, R-Mo., and Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, recently
introduced bills to help generic drugs get to market sooner.
   Schumer said this week that prospects for the bills improved
with Democratic control of the Senate, but Senate aides said no
official discussions have taken place since the changeover. -- By

TRADE
EU Officials Worried By Bush Steel Probe, U.S. `Unilateralism'
   Swedish Ambassador to the United States Jan Eliasson and
European Union Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy both said Thursday
that President Bush's decision to launch a Section 201
investigation of steel imports is likely to put a damper on next
week's EU-U.S. summit.
   Eliasson, said the steel decision would be "troublesome" to a
planned discussion on how the world's two largest trading
partners can avoid trade disputes and advance a new trade round.
   Eliasson, who represents all 15 EU member countries while
Sweden holds the group's presidency for the six months ending
June 30, spoke to reporters Thursday at an embassy briefing in
advance of the summit in Gothenberg, Sweden.
   Eliasson also said that developing a joint EU-U.S. statement
on global warming and the future of the Kyoto Protocol is proving
to be the most difficult aspect of pre-summit negotiations.
   Eliasson said the Europeans see "no alternative" to continuing
the Kyoto Protocol talks, which Bush has rejected. Eliasson also
said Bush must expect environmental protesters in Gothenburg.
   Lamy, who was in Washington for meetings on Capitol Hill, told
an Economic Strategy Institute luncheon, "We in Europe do not
accept the assumption that imports are the cause of the [steel]
problem."
   The European Union, he noted, has cut 50 million tons of
capacity and eliminated 750,000 jobs in the steel industry
without introducing import restrictions.
   Lamy said it would serve a purpose "to get the facts of this
troubled world industry out into the open."
   The European Union had proposed to the United States that the
fact finding process take place in the Organization for Economic
Development and Cooperation, Lamy said, but never received a
reply to its suggestion.
   Asked at a news conference after his speech about reports that
Bush initiated the steel action to get votes for trade
negotiating authority and to help launch a new round of trade
talks, Lamy said, "If at the end of the day, the European
steelworkers have to pay this way, I'm not sure the new round
will be very popular in Europe."
   Lamy also said the Europeans "are becoming concerned about
what we feel are growing pressures on this side of the Atlantic
toward unilateralism."
   Responding to speculation that the United States and the
European Union would make an announcement in Gothenburg about
launching a new round, Lamy said that would be "premature."
   Eliasson said Bush and European officials would discuss
foreign policy in the western Balkans, the Middle East and
Russia, the Korean Peninsula, the spread of HIV in Africa, and
the death penalty as well as trade policy and climate change. --

SENATE LEADERSHIP
Senate GOP Offers Plan For Nominees In Organizing Talks
   Senate Republican negotiators have agreed among themselves on
what formal assurances to seek from Democrats that the Senate
will take up President Bush's nominees quickly.
   But they have yet to reach a final agreement with Majority
Leader Daschle on a new organizing resolution for the Senate.
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said Thursday that Republicans were
delivering to Daschle a GOP-drafted document dealing with Bush
nominations. Senators said the document would be the basis for
some sort of memorandum of understanding or other formal
statement about nominees.
   Although Democrats did not have a direct hand in drafting the
statement, the general concepts have been negotiated during two
meetings between Daschle and a five-member GOP negotiating team.
   "The concepts that we've discussed with [Daschle] ... were not
turned down," said Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M.
   Domenici said the two sides were "getting close," and the GOP
proposal was "trying to reflect the views of all of the senators
that we talked to."
   A GOP aide said the goal was to have the Senate pass a new
organizing resolution Tuesday. That would provide time for the
two sides to come to a final agreement that could be vetted by
the entire Democratic Caucus and the GOP Conference, which meet
separately Tuesday.
   Both sides said the process has gone smoothly, a reflection of
a GOP decision to drop threats of a filibuster and demands that
any agreement include a mechanism to guarantee the swift movement
of nominees. -- By Geoff Earle

Bush To Nominate Veteran GOP Aide To Head SSA
   The White House announced Thursday that President Bush intends
to nominate Jo Anne Barnhart to a six-year term as head of the
Social Security Administration--which pumps out $450 billion a
year to 45 million, mainly elderly, pension recipients.
   Barnhart's appointment as Social Security commissioner is
subject to Senate confirmation.
   The commissioner's job is always a sensitive position because
of the vast administrative responsibility to make the checks go
out on time and keep the records straight.  But with the
president and congressional Democrats poised for a possible
battle over his plan to introduce personal stock-market accounts
to the system, the job could be even tougher than normal.
   Barnhart is a veteran GOP administrator of social programs
with strong links to ex-Sen. William Roth, R-Del. She was a
legislative assistant to Roth from 1977-1981 and ran his re-
election campaigns in 1988, 1994 and 2000. She served as
political director of the National Republican Senatorial
Committee during the 1995-96 cycle.
   Barnhart also has held social program positions in the federal
government:  Her highest post was HHS assistant secretary for
children and families 1990-93. Barnhart is currently a member of
the Social Security Advisory Board, which advises the president,
Congress and the commissioner on matters related to Social
Security and Supplemental Security Income.

Census Monitoring Board Study Questions Statistical Sampling
   Republican members of the Census Monitoring Board Thursday
released a report that they say bolsters the accuracy of the 2000
decennial census and questions the methodology of statistical
sampling.
   Board member David Murray questioned the "post-strata"
adjustment factors the bureau was going to use to calculate how
many people live in a specific geographical area.
   "Adjusting data for persons from New York City with data from
persons in Miami and Seattle has troubling implications,
especially when there are important geographic dimensions in the
use of census data," Murray said.
   Sampling means taking a comprehensive survey of the nation's
population and using the common characteristics of people in one
area to extrapolate the likely makeup of other, similar census
blocks.
   Board co-chairman Mark Neuman called the 2000 census "the most
accurate census in history" and said Census Bureau experts were
right to recommend against releasing sampling data for
congressional redistricting.
   Facing a statutory deadline to deliver census data, a special
bureau panel recommended in early March against releasing sampled
data, concluding that it could not endorse sampling as more
accurate than traditional data.
   Democratic supporters of sampling have vigorously argued that
with more time, statisticians might be able to validate the
sampling data.

TRANSPORTATION
Mica Schedules June Hearing To Evaluate Airline Improvements
   House Transportation and Infrastructure Aviation Subcommittee
Chairman John Mica, R-Fla., has scheduled a June 20 hearing to
give legislators the opportunity to evaluate the progress the
airlines are making in improving customer service.
   The hearing was scheduled in the wake of the airlines'
unveiling Thursday of a new series of voluntary commitments to
improve service, along with an agreement to make these service
commitments legally enforceable by including them in customer
contracts.
   The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee approved
legislation earlier this year granting airlines limited antitrust
immunity to discuss and coordinate flight schedules; Mica said he
expected a floor vote during the week of July 9. The House
Judiciary Committee has received a referral on that bill, but the

lands are managed," said Hansen. "The bill gives them that voice.
Under this bill, when a president creates a monument larger than
50,000 acres, he must solicit input from the public and the
affected governor and congressional delegation."
   The bill also gives Congress two years to approve the
monument. After that time, if Congress has not approved the
measure, the president's proclamation sunsets.
   "This means people who don't want a big monument in their
state can talk to their local leaders, their governor or their
congressional delegation," said Hansen.
   At a news conference, Hansen was joined by an original sponsor
of the bill, Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, along with GOP Reps.
George Radanovich of California, Greg Walden of Oregon, Chris
Cannon of Utah, Jim Gibbons of Nevada, Dennis Rehberg of Montana
and Jeff Flake of Arizona.
