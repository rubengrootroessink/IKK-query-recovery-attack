Private message.
Cynthia has dramatically increased her attacks on me in recent days--I've had 
"warnings" from a number of people.
She's openly saying that I have no Hill experience, she has attacked my use 
of outside consultants, she has challenged my handling of the BLM/Forest 
Service issue.
Today I heard about a message she sent to someone outside the company, 
"suggesting" to them that they never meet with me alone, but always have 
Chris Long present, and further that any communications with me in the future 
copy Scott and Donald.  In short, she's now trying to undercut my authority 
not just inside the office, but outside the office as well.
I've requested a meeting Thursday morning with Joe and Cynthia.  My strategy 
will be to say to Cynthia "if there's anything you want to say to me, now is 
the time," and to turn to Joe and say "You supervise both of us and I 
appreciate your being here to help us sort this out."
But my patience is wearing very, very thin.
