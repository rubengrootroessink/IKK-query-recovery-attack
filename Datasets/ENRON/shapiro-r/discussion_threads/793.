The Commission issued a couple of orders in PJM last week:

PJM=01,s Load Response Program:  FERC approved implementation of two load=
=20
response pilot programs proposed by PJM which will be effective June 1, 200=
1=20
through May 31, 2002.  Under the first program, referred to as the =01&Emer=
gency=20
Option,=018 a PJM member may sign up to be a participant in the program and=
 will=20
be paid the higher of the relevant zonal LMP or $500/MWh for the actual kWh=
=20
relief provided when the PJM member nominates load reduction in response to=
 a=20
request from PJM.  Under the second option, referred to as the =01&Economic=
=20
Option,=018 the PJM member will be able to reduce load in response to econo=
mic=20
signals, regardless of whether emergency conditions exist.  PJM will bill t=
he=20
LSE serving the end-use customer the LMP that would have been charged absen=
t=20
the reduction.  PJM will then refund to the LSE the retail generation and=
=20
transmission charges that the LSE would have received had the load not been=
=20
reduced.  The difference between the amount billed and refunded to the LSE=
=20
will be paid to the end-user.

Several customers opposed PJM=01,s programs, particularly the Economic Opti=
on. =20
However, FERC found that both programs allow end use customers to see price=
s=20
and respond to them when it is economically beneficial for them to do so. =
=20
FERC noted that because PJM's current market structure does not communicate=
=20
wholesale prices to retail customers in real time, they have no incentive t=
o=20
reduce demand when prices increase.  FERC finds that PJM's plan will, in=20
part, fix this flaw in its market structure.  PJM is required to file a=20
report with FERC by the end of the year evaluating the effectiveness of the=
=20
program.

Changes to PJM's Reliability Assurance Agreement (RAA):  FERC also approved=
=20
PJM's proposed changes to its RAA, effective June 1.  PJM had requested FER=
C=20
authorization to change the RAA by i) adjusting the time period over which =
an=20
LSE must commit generation resources to PJM to meet its capacity obligation=
s=20
under the RAA, from a daily to a seasonal commitment; ii) adjusting the=20
deficiency charge provisions to provide for a seasonal, rather than a daily=
,=20
penalty for LSEs; and iii) requiring generation owners to commit excess=20
capacity to PJM seasonally, rather than daily, in order to participate in a=
ny=20
distribution of revenues from capacity deficiency charges paid by LSEs.  EP=
MI=20
supported PJM's changes, stating that although the ICAP requirement should =
be=20
eliminated entirely, the proposed changes are a step in the right direction=
=20
in resolving the delisting problem.

In approving the changes, FERC stated that moving from daily to seasonal=20
deficiency charges discourages generators from delisting capacity during th=
e=20
summer and gives LSEs the incentive to meet their capacity obligations,=20
thereby helping PJM to meet its short-term and long-term reliability goals.=
 =20
FERC also said that PJM's Market Monitoring Unit will be able to monitor=20
generator gaming behavior and take appropriate action if necessary.
