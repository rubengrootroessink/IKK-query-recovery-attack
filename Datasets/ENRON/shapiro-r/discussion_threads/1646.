Rick, 

As I understand it, you wanted our wish list of what we would like (within 
the confines of Enron).  Here's my wish list:

1.  The business units within Enron are very segmented and that can prevent 
the cross-pollination of solutions for customers.  For example, if we could 
put together a program that linked commodity sales for a variety of customer 
sizes of load with load control devices and the offering of curtailable 
products, it would create a mechanism to 1) provide savings/income to 
customers during peak periods, 2)make power available to Enron during peak 
periods for resale and 3) help modulate the potential for outages and 
insufficient capacity.   The packaging of other energy efficiency services 
could also be considered in conjunction with this.

2. Coupled with and also apart from suggestion #1 above, Enron should 
increase its marketing of renewable products.  By doing so it would 1)work in 
hand with a curtailable program, by freeing up generation during a hot peak 
day - if photovoltaics are used, 2)enhance Enron's image in the community, 
3)serve a market niche.

3.  Have the opportunity to add two more wishes.

4. Coupled with and apart from suggestions #1 and 2 above, Enron should focus 
more on distributed generation alternatives which can 1) provide significant 
savings to customers since in many states stranded costs are not assessed on 
DG, 2) can be used as a source of energy during a peak period by paying the 
customer a premium to curtail and make the power available to Enron to sell 
on the market 3) help offset the problem of delivering power into a 
constrained control area where there is dg power we can tap into.

5. Create a forum within government affairs to collectively brainstorm and 
develop strategies to implement the needs of Enron's business units.  Clear 
identification of the goals and problem solving not only provide good 
solutions through the contribution of diverse viewpoints, but it is also an 
excellent learning experience for all participants as a clearer understanding 
of the goals emerge.  Also, participants can take with them a better 
understanding of what may be achievable, while others may  pick up ideas that 
can be reshaped and used in their jurisdictions.  

I hope this is in line with what you were looking for.  If not, please let me 
know and I'll ask for three more wishes.
Janine
