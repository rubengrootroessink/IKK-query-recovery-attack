Here is what I have been able to do on the list of accomplishments.  Tim 
Belden said it was impossible to quantify what we had done for the western 
market on a P/L basis for ENA, but that it was very important for creating a 
good market going forward. Nonetheless, he gave me a number (I thought a 
pretty low one)  based on what it would mean for his own P/L. I'm waiting to 
hear something back on one other item from EES.  Basically, most of it is 
pretty impossible to quantify.
