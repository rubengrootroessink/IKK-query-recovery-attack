FYI

May be I was too assertive in the press criticizing the stupidity of revoking 
Annex V and setting caps on spot.  Mr. Mauro Arce got upset, but he realized 
that his proposal to change the rules would face strong opposition, with 
solid arguments. 

In my simple view, he realized that not everyone would stay quiet.

Let's see.

Maurer,

Sorry, I forgot to copy you.
My opinion is that with this presentation and your  letter we are ready to go 
to Pedro Parente.

By the way:
Two non official news, but from reliable sources ( Assad and Fred) ;

NO CAP, MAE PRICE WILL BE 684 REAIS ( COST OF DEFICIT), announced by Mauro 
Arce
SUB-MARKET LIMITS BETWEEN SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST WILL BE SAME USED BY ONS. No 
more Encargos de Servi?os do Sistema being artificially created ( this was a 
condition precedent in our/Abradee's proposal). Fred has the resolution draft.

Let's wait to see the measures published, and celebrate these to small 
victories latter. The big one is Anex V. 

Joao Carlos

Attached document prepared by our guys ( Sergio, Fred, myself, and part of 
Abradee's team ) yesterday night in Brasilia and given to Mauro Arce today by 
Sergio Assad.
It is not perfect, but opportunity sometimes is gold.
Our idea (Orlando) is to go to Pedro Parente and present/discuss it with him.
