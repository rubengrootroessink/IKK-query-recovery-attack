Rick, Steve,

FYI

Last week President Fox invited Jaime Alatorre to his trip to Canada.  At 
some point they discussed energy reform and the need to bring in the private 
sector into the discussion to make sure that the new regulation was 
attractive to investors.

After that conversation President Fox asked Jaime Alatorre to head an effort 
to build consensus in the private sector with respect to energy reform.  He 
met today with Secretary Martens for 90 minutes to discuss strategy and 
implementation.

I am meeting this afternoon with Marten's Chief of Staff,  Mauricio Camps to 
give him materials and to discuss the main issues of the private sector and 
of the energy companies.

I think it will be very important to be very close to Jaime on this in order 
to be able to give him the necessary technical and strategic support that he 
will be needing during this process.  

Probably a way to do it is to congratulate him and to offer help.  We would 
then have to make sure that any of you have a periodical call with him for 
the group to have adequate information on the process and also to be able to 
identify areas of opportunity that will surely appear.

Please let me know how you want me to proceed or the degree of involvement 
that you want me to have on this.

Best,

Ricardo
