Rick --

Attached please find a memo that I intend to distribute to Government Affairs 
regarding assignments to support ENA.  Some of the people in the attached 
file report to you.  I wanted to make sure that these assignments were ok 
with you all before I sent this out.  

Please keep this confidential.  If there are any issues, please call me.  I 
would like to send out on Monday.

Jim
