The Corporate Marketing team along with members of other BU's will be holding 
a mid year off-site on Aug 3. The objectives are to enhance their marketing 
knowledge, refine our strategy, learn more about the resources that exist 
within Enron, and discuss ways in which we can add greater value to the 
business.

Our off-site will be held at the Woodlands Conference Center, and I would 
like to invite you to speak to about (20 to 25 people) for a half an hour on 
Friday morning. I know you live close by, so I hope this won't be an 
inconvience. Since our department fosters entrepreneurial thinking and seeks 
to learn more about new initiatives within Enron, all would benefit from 
hearing from you specifically about the following: The objectives for 
government and regulatory affairs domestically; how California may have 
disrupted Enron's plans; key objectives that need to be achieved, the 
strategies you are employing; and the role that marketing can play (if any) 
in the process. 

Please let me know if you will be available to join us, and we can discuss 
specifics closer to the date. 

Best regards,
Dennis
