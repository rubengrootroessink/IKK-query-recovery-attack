Publisher's Note
================
The EU Member States may disagree about exactly when they will able
to let in the new members from Eastern and Central Europe. But
preparations for their accession continue apace.

The EU's Council of Ministers this week gave the Commission the go-
ahead to negotiate 'framework agreements' with Cyprus, Malta and
Turkey for their early participation in programmes such as the EU's
R&D Programme and education and vocational training programmes. They
will also be able to take part in all the programmes already open to
the candidate countries of central/eastern Europe.

Early participation in EU programmes forms an important part of a pre-
accession strategy already used for central and eastern European
candidates. It provides useful preparation for accession by
familiarising the candidate countries and their citizens with Union
policies and working methods.

1. Agreement reached over EU takeover directive
-----------------------------------------------
The EU has finally agreed the contents of the Takeover Directive
after 12 years of negotiation. The Conciliation deal between the
European Parliament and the Council would force company boards to
inform minority shareholders and workers of their recommendations on
a takeover offer at the same time as the majority shareholders.
Governments would have until 2005 to pass the legislation but with an
extra year's grace to pass a ban on 'poison pill' defences.

2. Irish vote on EU Treaty referendum
-------------------------------------
On Thursday, Ireland became the first and only country to ask its
people to vote on proposals to enlarge the EU. The result of the
referendum on whether to ratify the Nice Treaty was expected by late
afternoon on Friday.

3. EIB signals greater focus on Eastern Europe, research
--------------------------------------------------------
The European Investment Bank, at its annual meeting in Luxembourg,
signalled the Bank's aim of limiting growth of its lending within the
EU member countries in order to give more room for activities in the
candidate countries. The Bank has also called for a capital increase
in 2003.

The EIB and the Commission this week also signed a memorandum for
closer co-operation in the funding of European research.

4. EU warns Germany over gas liberalisation

5. Turkey mulls adopting euro before EU membership: report
----------------------------------------------------------
Turkey could adopt the euro unilaterally before joining the EU,

Times on Monday. Dervis said the move would be possible in five years
if Turkey managed to achieve low inflation - currently at 60 per
cent - and fulfilled other EU membership criteria, the paper said.

'An example of a (first) pan European Certification Services can be
found at www.fp5csp.org which is a certification provider for all who
wish to participate in the 5th Framework Programme for R&D of the
Commission'. (Robbert Fisher, estratconsulting)
'The UK has introduced the Electronic Communications Act, but some EU
members have yet to comply. The UK act gives legal recognition to
electronic signatures and provides an approval scheme for firms
offering cryptography services.' (Charlie Price, LawZONE)

'How can these people talk "making the EU the most competitive
economy in the world by 2010 and the Commission claims that increased
tax co-ordination would help countries meet these objectives"... are
these not effectively the same people who, for example, ever campaign
to extend the same work practices that restrict the rights of
employers (and willing employees) to demand longer working hours etc.
etc ... or have I completely missed the boat here perhaps? Tweaking
tax and cross border issues alone will not bring make this commercial
dream happen ... We compete with completely deregulated markets ...
rather big ones I fear, we lack dynamism, freedom and choice ... "
