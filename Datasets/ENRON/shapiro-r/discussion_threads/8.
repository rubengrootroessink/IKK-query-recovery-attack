This law appears to supercede state laws and allows for electronic 
signatures.  Perhaps this should be circulated to everyone in Rick's group.

This should be of particular interests to the marketers.

Both the NCLC Energy List and NARUC Consumer Affairs folks will be
interested in S. 761 which was enacted by Congress and is awaiting
President's signature.  This legislation creates an "electronic
signature" law and preempts any state law to the contrary.  There is an
exception for a number of written signature requirements and
notification of information in writing, including an exemption for
"cancellation or termination of utlity services (including water, heat
and power)" [Section 103(b)(3)]  Please note the absence of specific
reference to telephone service, but the term "utility service" may
suffice.

My preliminary reading suggests that this statute would preempt a state
law or regulation that requires a customer to enroll with a competitive
supplier with a "wet signature."

This legislation does not require a customer to agree to provide a
signature electronically, but does prevent a state from prohibiting a
commercial entity from seeking an electronic signature as a valid and
legal signature.
