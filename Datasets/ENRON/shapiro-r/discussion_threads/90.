FYI.    This is something we need to keep a close eye on, and I will do so.

Subject: Justice Department Investigation

Louise --

I wanted to make sure you were aware that the Justice Department has launched 
an investigation into the online electronic bond trading site set up by 
Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Chase, and others.   The Justice Department 
said that they are studying the "competitive issues that arise from such 
close cooperation among competitors."

I will monitor this very closely, as I'm sure it will have implications for 
the likes of ICE.

Hope you're doing well.

Lisa
