Kyoto Protocol Becomes New Albatross for Bush Administration=20

By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis=20

[IMAGE]President Bush and European leaders "agreed to disagree" over a glob=
al=20
warming treaty, as the president sought to reassure allies that sharp polic=
y=20
differences would not hamper relations between Europe and the United States=
.=20
During several closed-door sessions, Bush and his European counterparts=20
confronted one of their most contentious areas of disagreement: the=20
president's rejection of the Kyoto Protocol on global warming. "We agreed t=
o=20
disagree," Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson told reporters. "The Europe=
an=20
Union is sticking to the Kyoto Protocol. The United States has chosen anoth=
er=20
policy."=20

Analysis: It is rather amazing how prominently energy issues have factored=
=20
into the first six months of the Bush administration. In contrast to the=20
eight years of the Clinton administration, when energy policy often took a=
=20
backseat to other concerns, President Bush=0F-a result of California blacko=
uts,=20
a national shortage of natural gas, sky-high electricity prices, and a=20
controversial energy task plan=0F-been comparatively consumed by energy iss=
ues.=20
Now, in a political legacy from the previous administration, President Bush=
=20
finds himself grappling with another contentious energy problem that has=20
global ramifications. Departing from what appears to be an international=20
consensus, President Bush has declared the Kyoto Protocol an ineffective=20
treaty and has instead decided to further examine the greenhouse gas proble=
m,=20
which has raised further questions about the president's commitment to=20
environmental issues.=20

First, let me provide some background. The Kyoto Protocol developed out of=
=20
meetings held in December 1997 in Kyoto, Japan, during which time the Unite=
d=20
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change agreed in principle to a=20
series of strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. About 170=20
governments of various countries, including the United States, participated=
=20
in the Protocol and agreed to reduce their aggregate carbon dioxide (CO2)=
=20
equivalent emissions by at least 5 percent below 1990 levels by 2012.=20
Noticeably exempt from the Protocol were developing countries such as China=
=20
and India=0F-of the largest greenhouse gas emitters in the world&#151which=
=20
resisted taking on any sort of formal reduction plan until industrialized=
=20
countries proceeded with their own. This marked the central flaw in the=20
Protocol in that participants such as Europe, Japan and the United States=
=20
argued that it would be impossible to reach the Protocol's goals without th=
e=20
active and controlled participation of developing countries. Consequently,=
=20
the United States could not garner two-thirds support from the Senate, whic=
h=20
would be required to ratify the Protocol, despite endorsement from the=20
Clinton administration. The United States is the largest emitter of CO2,=20
accounting for one-quarter of the world total per year, and thus its=20
participation in the Protocol has been considered essential.=20

The Protocol's emissions targets include all major greenhouse gases: carbon=
=20
dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide (NOx), and greenhouse gases created by=20
industrial processes, which are artificial chemicals called halocarbons=20
(CFCs, HFCs and PFCs) and long-lived gases such as sulphur hexafluoride=20
(SF6). The Protocol requires the main developed countries to reduce their=
=20
emissions of the greenhouse gases by varying amounts: 8 percent for Europea=
n=20
Union countries, 7 percent for the United States and 6 percent for Japan. =
=20

With the onset of his new administration, President Bush announced last Mar=
ch=20
that the United States would not support the Kyoto Protocol, again arguing=
=20
that developing nations were not included and the goals were not realistic.=
=20
Further, Bush has voiced the concern that ratifying the Protocol would=20
severely damage the U.S. economy as it would restrict industrial production=
.=20
The president has also pointed out that, although European nations espouse=
=20
support for the Protocol, none of the EU members has yet to ratify the=20
treaty. Instead, President Bush has adopted a "go-slow" approach toward=20
global warming and has vowed to spend more money to investigate the problem=
=20
and work with other nations to produce a better plan. =20

A new report from the National Academy of Sciences, requested by the Bush=
=20
administration, found that global warming is indeed occurring as the result=
=20
of human activity. Specifically, the report found that the Earth's=20
temperatures could rise between 2.5 and 10.4 degrees Fahrenheit by the end =
of=20
this century. On the other hand, the report could not reliably establish ho=
w=20
much of the warming trends result from natural variations, how fast future=
=20
warming will occur or how corrective actions might correct it. Thus, the=20
president asserted that these unanswered questions warranted further=20
investigation into the greenhouse gas problem. =20

The president has come under fire both domestically and abroad for what is=
=20
perceived as a policy that gives preference to business over the environmen=
t.=20
In addition to his opposition to the Kyoto Protocol, President Bush also=20
announced in March that he opposes any domestic restrictions in CO2 emissio=
ns=20
from the nation's power plants, retracting on a pledge that he had made=20
during his campaign. Carbon dioxide is not classified as a pollutant by the=
=20
Clean Air Act, and thus the White House said that Bush's original promise w=
as=20
a "mistake" inconsistent with the president's broader goal of increasing=20
domestic energy production. Toward that end, the Bush administration has=20
focused on the construction of some 1,900 new power plants across the count=
ry=20
to resolve a growing supply / demand imbalance. On the other hand, business=
=20
groups have applauded the president's approach, echoing his belief that the=
=20
Protocol would harm the nation's economy and that domestic, technology-base=
d=20
solutions represent a better solution.=20

This is obviously a political story packed with passion on both sides of th=
e=20
debate. I won't use this space to criticize or defend President Bush's=20
environmental stand. Instead, I think it will be useful to clearly identify=
=20
the two polarized approaches that world leaders are taking toward the Kyoto=
=20
Protocol. European leaders have vowed to enact the Protocol without the=20
United States, which may not be possible. The Protocol can only be enacted =
if=20
nations that produced 55 percent of the industrialized world's carbon dioxi=
de=20
in 1990 decide to ratify it. Japan could be the wild card in the debate, as=
=20
it is leaning toward the Protocol but has not yet officially ratified it. I=
f=20
Japan does participate, proponents of the Protocol would have 57.5 percent =
of=20
1990 emissions (enough for ratification). =20

Nevertheless, here is how the two approaches shake out:=20

The Bush Approach We were given the best indication of the approach Preside=
nt=20
Bush plans to take in his own environmental proposal (expected some time th=
is=20
summer), in a recent radio address. "With new technology, sound regulation=
=20
and plain good sense, we can expand our energy production while protecting=
=20
the environment," the president said. The Bush administration's previously=
=20
released energy plan is primarily focused on building the nation's energy=
=20
supply through the expedited construction of new generation (including=20
nuclear power plants). Further, the president has said that "energy=20
production and environmental protection are not competing priorities" and c=
an=20
both be achieved with new technology. =20

While the president has not made any specific references to new provisions=
=20
for limiting CO2 emissions from existing or new plants, the new technology =
to=20
which he has referred most likely includes clean-coal technologies that can=
=20
be implemented to reduce emissions from coal-fired plants. As noted in the=
=20
3/27/01 IssueAlert, new, clean-coal technologies are being tested and=20
developed by various companies throughout the United States. One example is=
=20
the integrated gasification-combined cycle (IGCC) technology that first=20
converts coal into a combustible gas, cleans the gas of virtually all=20
pollutants, then burns the gas in a turbine much like natural gas. More tha=
n=20
99 percent of sulfur, nitrogen and particulate pollutants can be removed in=
=20
the process. Three gasification power plants have been built in Florida,=20
Indiana and Nevada. As coal remains the United States' most abundant fuel=
=20
source, constituting 95 percent of our nation's fossil energy reserves, muc=
h=20
of the nation's plan for reducing emissions will focus on coal-fired=20
generation. It is important to note, however, that most of the clean-coal=
=20
technologies currently being developed eliminate SO2 pollutants and NOx, bu=
t=20
may do little to address CO2 emissions, which is the primary focus of the=
=20
Kyoto Protocol.=20

President Bush has also stated that his administration will fully fund high=
=20
priority areas for scientific research into climate change over the next fi=
ve=20
years, and help developing nations such as China and India to match the U.S=
.=20
commitment.=20

The Kyoto Protocol Approach European Commission President Romano Prodi has=
=20
said that the 15 European Union countries will proceed with ratifying the=
=20
Kyoto Protocol. As noted, the participation of another large industrialized=
=20
country such as Japan is needed to officially enact the Protocol. If the=20
Protocol is enacted, an international conference will be held in Bonn,=20
Germany, this July to spell out how the specific goals of the treaty will b=
e=20
reached. Toward this end, French President Jacques Chirac recently commente=
d=20
that, "Now is not the time to conduct new studies. These studies have alrea=
dy=20
been done. We have to set objectives." Specifically, European countries wil=
l=20
proceed with setting specific and targeted cuts in their emission gases suc=
h=20
as CO2 produced by power plants powered by fossil fuels. The EU has said=20
that, if ratified, it will comply with the Protocol's standards for emissio=
ns=20
reduction by 2012 and go "significantly further" to reduce emissions beyond=
=20
that date. Yet, interestingly, across the Continent, nuclear power, which=
=20
produces no CO2 emissions, has undergone a resurgence and presently generat=
es=20
an increasing percentage of the power in countries such as France and=20
Germany. =20

However, we have a good indication of the specific measures from negotiatio=
ns=20
that took place during the Clinton administration. Most of the emissions=20
targets of the participating countries will be reached through=20
emission-trading mechanisms. Trading emission of greenhouse gases allows=20
industrialized countries to buy emissions rights from each other at a price=
=20
commonly agreed. In other words, industrialized countries that do not meet=
=20
emissions targets can strike deals with other industrialized nations that d=
o=20
better than required. This may encourage reductions to be made where they a=
re=20
most needed. However, critics have suggested that the mechanisms amount to=
=20
loopholes that would allow large polluting countries to continue polluting,=
=20
while smaller countries trade credits that do not amount to significant=20
reductions.=20

Moreover, the two approaches being pursued by President Bush and the Europe=
an=20
Union represent inherently different philosophies regarding the urgency of=
=20
emissions control and methods that should be employed to reduce greenhouse=
=20
gases. There is little possibility that President Bush will change his stan=
d=20
and include the United States in the Kyoto Protocol. Without U.S.=20
participation, the Protocol may once again be stalled unless another large=
=20
industrialized country such as Japan decides to join. On his own, President=
=20
Bush now moves forward with constructing a plan for the United States that=
=20
attempts to balance the reduction of emissions while aggressively expanding=
=20
the country's generation supply. This will be a difficult balance to achiev=
e,=20
but the president remains confident that environmental protection and=20
industrial expansion do not need to be mutually exclusive.=20
