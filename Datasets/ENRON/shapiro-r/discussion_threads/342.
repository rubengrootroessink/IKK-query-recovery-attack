FYI  - I think we can make a case that we are still in the running on the 
basis of the highlighted portions.

Mr. Speaker:
This Legislature passed the Energy Competition Act in 1998 to help meet the
province's long-term electricity needs and ensure that Ontarians have a
safe, reliable and affordable supply of power.
When this government came to office in 1995, we had our work cut out for us.
Ontario's electricity sector was failing us.
Consumers and businesses had no choice of who supplied them with power. And
we went from having one of the lowest prices for electricity to the third
highest in Canada.
The monopoly we had come to rely on for safe, reliable and
competitively-priced electricity was no longer working. It had become out of
date, inefficient and too expensive. Something had to be done.
That's why I'm proud to stand up in the Legislature today to announce that:
The government is confident that conditions necessary to open the
electricity market to competition will exist by May 2002. The government is
committed to an open market while guaranteeing a safe, affordable and
reliable supply.
There are some who are fundamentally opposed to opening this market to
competition. Our government believes, however, that open, competitive
markets are beneficial. They keep costs low, encourage innovation and
benefit consumers.
There are others who share our desire to open the market, but who would like
to see it done even sooner. As government, we bear a responsibility to
ensure the opening is done right for all involved. To do this, we are
committed to opening the market at the earliest possible date, while
ensuring all of the conditions required for a smooth transition to
competition are met.
And I'm pleased to tell you, Mr. Speaker, that the four principles guiding
the government's vision have been, or will be met, by May 2002.

First and foremost, protecting consumers and offering more choice. The
overall market design and regulatory framework for introducing competition
puts customers first. Over the long term, a competitive market will lead to
the lowest possible costs and better service for all.
Second, creating a strong business climate with a reliable supply of
electricity. Ontario already has sufficient supply to meet our current
needs. Announcing a firm market opening deadline today provides greater
certainty to potential new investors who have already announced 3 billion
dollars in new generation projects.
Thirdly, we will protect our environment. My colleague, the Minister of the
Environment has announced tough new emission caps for the electricity
sector. They will be among the toughest in North America, matching the
requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
Also today, Minister Witmer is announcing changes to ensure that new
electricity projects are reviewed in a clear and consistent manner under the
province's environmental assessment process.
And fourth, we will encourage new ways of doing business and support the
search for alternative sources of power. For the first time, customers will
be able to make clean air a priority by choosing the type of power they
want, including wind, fuel cells and solar. Giving them choice will help
promote the demand for cleaner, greener electricity.

And so, Mr. Speaker, I am proud to announce that Ontario's electricity
sector will open by May 2002. The government is keeping its promise to
introduce a competitive electricity market. We will do it, and we have put
the principles in place to ensure that we do it right.

Thank you.
