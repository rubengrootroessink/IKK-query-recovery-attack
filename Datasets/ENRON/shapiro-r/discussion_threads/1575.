Joe Allen has requested a $500 PAC contribution for Pat Rosenberg, a 
candidate running for HISD.  She is the wife of an Enron employee.  I have 
not requested contributions in school board races since our PAC funds are 
limited.  (Another Enron employee asked for $1000 PAC contribution for 
someone he was personally supporting for school board.)      

Elizabeth Linnell gathered some historical data regarding PAC contributions 
to education candidates:

 The PAC made contributions to the following organizations in 1997 and 1999 
at $1,000 in each case:
  Houston Citizens for Better Education
  Houston Friends for Better Education
  Houston Parents for Better Education
  Houston Taxpayers for Better Education

 In 1995 the PAC gave $500 to Lori Becker, a school board candidate.

Joe said that Pat Rosenberg has $20,000 in her campaign fund and he is trying 
to help her get more money in, as soon as possible, to get her numbers up.  
What are your thoughts regarding PAC contributions to school board 
candidates?  I asked the same question of Sue Walden several weeks ago, and 
she indicated that she does not get involved in school board races.  Thanks,  
Jean
