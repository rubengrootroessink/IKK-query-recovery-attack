Rick - 

Attached are the monthly reports received from Linda Robertson, Jean Ryall, 
Paul Kaufman and Ricardo Charvel.  The monthly report for Canada is in 
progress but I have confirmed with Aleck that there are no changes to the 
project list he supplied for the Woodlands offsite.

In addition, attached is an updated Resources Report for your review and use.

Please advise of any questions, comments or concerns.

Eric
