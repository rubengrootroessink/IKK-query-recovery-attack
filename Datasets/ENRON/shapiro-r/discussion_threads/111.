Rick - 

Attached is a revised budget spreadsheet for EGA for outside services fixed 
and discretionary and other business expenses.  Information was updated for 
Janine Migden fixed outside services (this is the IL lobbyist issue we 
discussed earlier today).  Please advise if you want me to send this 
spreadsheet to the cost center owners.

Thanks,

Eric
