Dominik,

It was good to speak with you at the EEMF Forum; we all found your 
presentation impressive and the responses to the questions finely tuned to 
leave us thinking that we had been given priviledged access to information 
when in fact we hadn't; what a pro!

As I said, my colleague Rick Shapiro (head of our global public affairs)  was 
impressed and he was serious when he thought of you for our Frankfurt 
office.  I am sure that if you showed interest, things could move quickly (or 
even slowly, if that's what you wanted) and any particular circumstances that 
you had would be taken into account.  I can certainly attest to the welcoming 
nature of Enron.  have a think about it, and if you want to folow up, on a 
completely informal and no commitment basis, let me know.  Even if you do not 
want to leave, it's good to know what your market worth is!!

Lunch some time? 

Brendam
