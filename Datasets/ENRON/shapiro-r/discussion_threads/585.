Reliant Energy Urges Governor Davis to Trade Political Fingerpointing for 
Solutions

HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 17, 2001--Reliant Energy strongly disagrees 
with California Governor Gray Davis' recent characterization of the company 
as being ``obstructionist'' and opposing court orders.

Reliant Energy believes that these accusations are politically motivated 
attempts to demonize Reliant Energy as an outsider responsible for causing 
the state's energy crisis. The accusations are simply not based on fact. More 
importantly, the governor's attacks have done nothing to increase the state's 
supply of electricity or prevent the blackouts expected this summer. If 
anything, the comments have fostered an atmosphere of distrust and 
uncertainty that have further destabilized the market.

``Reliant hopes the governor and others will stop these baseless accusations 
and focus on true solutions to California's energy shortage,'' said Joe Bob 
Perkins, president and chief operating officer, Reliant Energy Wholesale 
Group. ``We are now being singled out because we believe in an open market, 
not government control of power generation, and we have offered solutions 
that do not jibe with the governor's political agenda. Contrary to the 
perception Governor Davis is attempting to promote, we have been focused on 
providing solutions that are fair to all parties in California since the 
outset of this crisis. In fact, earlier this week we provided the governor's 
office with an outline of a series of emergency measures that, if pursued 
quickly, could help mitigate the power crisis this summer. We are still 
waiting on a response.''

Perkins pointed out many of the steps Reliant Energy has taken to keep the 
lights on in California, disputing the accusation of being ``obstructionist'':

Reliant Energy has run its 30-to-50-year-old plants at the highest levels 
since their purchase in 1998. In 2000, Reliant nearly doubled the output from 
these plants to meet the needs of Californians -- running them at levels far 
exceeding the prior owner, Southern California Edison.

Reliant Energy invested $80 million dollars in 2000 alone to upgrade plants 
to make sure the most power possible is available during peak times. In 
addition, the company improved emissions levels to clean up the environment 
and keep costs for emission credits to a minimum.

For the last two years, Reliant has encouraged the Investor Owned Utilities 
and the state to invest in long-term contracts to stabilize rates instead of 
relying on the spot market. In particular, Reliant Energy offered to sell 
power at two cents per kilowatt-hour if the buyer would purchase the natural 
gas required to generate the power, ensuring a transparent cost of power.

Reliant Energy has never shut down generation despite the prevalent concerns 
that continue to exist over credit issues. In contrast, just last week a 
major out-of-state supplier refused to continue to sell to California unless 
payment was forthcoming.

Reliant Energy has created an aggressive curtailment plan to encourage 
businesses to ``sell back'' power voluntarily to add more power to the 
Western power grid. The company has met with many leaders in Western states 
to introduce the program, yet California officials will not even engage in a 
dialogue on the program.

``We welcome the opportunity to discuss these issues one-on-one with the 
governor,'' Perkins said. ``Unfortunately, he has repeatedly refused this 
request over the past year. Last week's meeting with generators was the first 
time the group was allowed to speak with him directly, and obviously the 
purpose of that meeting was political grandstanding.''

Perkins added that the governor's accusations of opposing court orders are 
unfounded. ``We have always worked within the law and are proud of our 
commitment to keeping the lights on. We have followed all court orders and 
worked closely with the FERC and others to cooperate fully with all 
investigations. When necessary, we have filed court challenges to orders that 
we believe violate our rights -- hardly an illegal action.''
