Rick - 

Attached is a Resources Spreadsheet for our meeting tomorrow afternoon.  The 
spreadsheet is broken out by Cost Center and lists employee name, project the 
employee is working on, and the business unit affected (if known).  There is 
also a column for prob. of success that I thought would be filled out at the 
meeting.  The information on this spreadsheet is taken from the monthly 
reports (that I have worked on or have received) and the old IRTF report 
submitted.  I also spoke to Ricardo who gave me his projects.  I've worked 
with Jim Steffes, Sue Nord, and Lisa Yoho on the preparation of their monthly 
reports.  I know that Jim's report went out yesterday but I haven't seen the 
final version.  You should receive the final report for Sue and Lisa this 
week.  Please advise if the information on the attached spreadsheet meets our 
needs for tomorrow.  I can make changes in the morning.  I've got to work on 
Lisa's report in the morning and finalize the presentation for Friday.  I 
think Lisa left you a voice mail about the training program.  The slides are 
done for the presentation and I need to write what I'm going to say.  I think 
that's it for now.  Sorry if this rambles.

Eric
