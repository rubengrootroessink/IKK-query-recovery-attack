HOLLINGS FAVORS SMALLER COMMERCE COMMITTEE;
INOUYE SET TO RETAKE COMMUNICATIONS GAVEL

It's still too early in the Senate transition game to tell which
issues -- telecom related or not -- will come to a head under a
Democratic-led Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee.
But incoming Chairman Ernest F. Hollings (D., S.C.) already has
singled out one item for immediate attention -- downsizing the
Commerce Committee.

The panel gained two seats for a total of 22 at the outset of the
107th Congress.  Under a Senate "power-sharing" pact that went
into effect last January, all the committees were drawn up to
reflect the Senate's 50-50 split between Democrats and
Republicans (TR, Jan. 15).

But with Sen. James Jeffords's (R., Vt.) departure from the GOP
expected to take effect this week, Democrats are pushing a new
reorganization plan that would give them a one-seat advantage on
each committee.  For the Commerce Committee, Sen. Hollings
prefers trimming a Republican from the panel rather than adding a
Democrat, his spokesman said.

"He feels the Commerce Committee is starting to get too large and
plans to work with [incoming Majority Leader Thomas A.] Daschle
[D., S.D.] to come up with a final determination," the spokesman
told TR today.

It is too early to discuss specific Commerce Committee agenda
items for the remainder of the year, the Hollings spokesman said.
But before he begins pushing an agenda, Sen. Hollings will confer
with current Commerce Committee Chairman John McCain (R., Ariz.),
he added.

"While the committee's priorities have yet to be determined, the
style in which they work won't be changing," the spokesman said.
"Clearly, Sens. McCain and Hollings have a long-standing, working
relationship. . .and cover issues that transcend party lines.
They pride themselves on moving things out of that committee in
bipartisan fashion, and that isn't going to change," he added.

On the telecom front, Sen. Hollings is in line to become chairman
of the communications subcommittee, but he's not expected to
assume that post.  Instead, the subcommittee's gavel likely will
return to Sen. Daniel K. Inouye (Hawaii), who last held the top
spot there in 1994.

A Hollings-Inouye pairing would be good news for those who don't
want Congress to overhaul the Telecommunications Act of 1996.
Earlier this year, Sens. Inouye and Hollings were two of four
senators who called on FCC Chairman Michael K. Powell to maintain
the "strict adherence and strong enforcement" of the local
market-opening mandates spelled out in sections 251 and 271 of
the Act (TR, April 30).

Sen. Inouye also has pressed the FCC for quick action on
Northpoint Technologies Ltd.'s applications to operate in the Ku-
band (TR, May 28), and he was an original cosponsor to a bill, S
414, to set up a new telecom program to be administered by the
Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and Information
Administration (TR, March 5).

For current communications subcommittee Chairman Conrad Burns
(R., Mont.), the loss of the gavel shouldn't disrupt the rollout
of his "tech seven" agenda of telecom and Internet issues, his
spokeswoman said.  "It's still his top priority," she said.  Sen.
Burns "enjoys a good working relationship with [Sen.] Hollings
and feels they'll move the tech seven agenda."

TECH COALITION BACKS BUSH's CALL
TO EXTEND CHINA's TRADE STATUS

A coalition of groups representing telecom equipment and high-
tech companies today said Congress should extend normal trade
relations (NTR) status with China for another year.  The U.S.
High-Tech Industry Coalition said it "strongly endorsed"
President Bush's call for such an extension.

Extending China's normal trade status would "protect current U.S.
high-tech investments and businesses in China, thus enhancing
opportunities for increased market access once China formally
joins the World Trade Organization," the coalition said.  China
is "moving toward completing" all of its accession procedures for
joining the WTO, it added.

The coalition includes the AeA (formerly the American Electronics
Association), the Computer & Communications Industry Association,
Information Technology Association of America, Information
Technology Industry Council, and the Telecommunications Industry
Association.


***************************************************************
HEALTH RESEARCHERS TO SETTLE LAWSUIT OVER USE OF PRIVATE
CELLPHONE RECORDS

The group that led a six-year, $27 million industry-funded effort
to study the health effects of mobile phones has agreed to settle
a class-action lawsuit.  The suit was filed in 1995 on behalf of
mobile phone users who claimed their privacy was invaded.  Their
phone records were reviewed without their permission as part of
the research project, the plaintiffs said.

Wireless Technology Research LLC has agreed to turn over the
remaining $1.4 million of a $2 million insurance policy that the
wireless industry purchased for it in the wake of the litigation.
As part of the settlement agreement, $250,000 of those funds will
be set aside to fund a voluntary, surveillance registry to assess
whether there is a link between mobile phone use and illnesses.

The registry will be run by WTR Chairman George L. Carlo, who had
a falling out with the wireless industry after he accused it of
failing to act on research that he said indicated a link between
mobile phone use and adverse health effects.  The settlement also
reserves $150,000 for future legal expenses of Mr. Carlo and WTR.

In addition, mobile phone subscribers included in the class would
get a 50% discount on a book Mr. Carlo co-authored last year,
"Cell Phones: Invisible Hazards in the Wireless Age."

Attorneys for the plaintiffs in "Jerald P. Busse et al. v.
Motorola, Inc. et al." (case no. 95 CH 10332) have asked the Cook
County, Ill., Circuit Court to hold a hearing Thursday on the
proposed settlement.  If the court approves the agreement, WTR
would be dropped from the lawsuit, but other defendants from the
wireless industry would remain.

An aide for Mr. Carlo told TR today he couldn't discuss the
settlement until it is finalized.  Michael F. Altschul, senior
vice president-policy and administration and general counsel for
the Cellular Telecommunications & Internet Association, which is
a defendant in the case, also declined to comment, saying
industry attorneys were reviewing the proposed settlement.

CLEC ASKS FCC TO STAY RECIPROCAL COMPENSATION ORDER

Competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC) Core Communications,
Inc. (CoreTel) has asked the FCC to stay the effectiveness of a
recent order overhauling reciprocal compensation rules.  The new
rules are designed to phase out payments received by carriers for
connecting calls to Internet service providers (ISPs).  CoreTel
said the order could force it to abandon some of its markets.

CoreTel took issue with two provisions of the order in Common
Carrier dockets 96-98 and 99-68 (TR, April 23).  One is the ban
on carriers' receiving reciprocal compensation for terminating
calls to ISPs in any new markets entered after the adoption of
the order.  The other is the "growth cap" provision, which limits
annual increases in a carrier's reciprocal compensation revenue.

The order allows CLECs that already are operating in a particular
geographic area to continue receiving reciprocal compensation
revenues up to the limit set by the growth cap, while hampering
new CLECs, CoreTel noted.  That situation puts new CLECs entering
those markets at an "extreme competitive disadvantage," it said.

"The business that CoreTel will lose as a result of these new
rules and the competitive advantage they confer on established
CLECs is incalculable and irremediable at some later date,"
CoreTel said.  It will suffer "irreparable harm" if the
provisions aren't stayed pending judicial review, the company
added.
