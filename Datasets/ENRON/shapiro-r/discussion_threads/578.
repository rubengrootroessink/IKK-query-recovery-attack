Hi Lisa:

Nice talking to you. Attached is the list of country that we expect to 
generate deals from:

China
Hong Kong
Taiwan
Indonesia
India
Pakistan
Bangladesh
Sri Lanka
Japan
Korea
Australia
New Zealand
Vietnam
Philippines
Thailand
Singapore
Malayasia
Middle East Regions

The countries are not ranked. We are looking to learn more about the 
government regulations for both export and import or wastepaper, pulp and 
newsprint to and from these countries. Hope it helps in streamlining the deal 
approval process before the transaction volume picks up.

Attached please also find the latest sales territory allocation for EIM Asia

I look forward to working with you and your team.
