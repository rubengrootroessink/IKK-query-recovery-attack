And 5 for continental gas, C&EE, Climate Change Levy

1. Block attempts by GTE (association of European gas transportation 
companies) to establish unacceptable common standards in interconnection and 
interoperability / promote more pro-competitive standards
2. (With Paul Hennemeyer) Promote rTPA to gas pipelines in Germany.
3. Clarification of Climate Change Levy to fit with EES model on outsourcing
4. Cross-border power trades from Czech/Poland into Germany
5. Greek electricity supply licence and access to capacity in Greece-Italy

It's late (even in Houston!) but here are five for the Brussels office, plus 
Continental Power,  plus France, Belgium and NL:
 1. Arcos gas TPA (anti-trust angles).
 2. Cross border power transmission CWE - eliminating transaction based 
tariffs and achieving transparency/ non discrimination in allocation of ATC.
 3. Freeing up more power export transmission capacity from, and optimising 
forthcoming auction of virtual generating capacity inside, France.
 4. Resolving restrictions on availability to new entrants of power import 
transmission capacity into NL.
 5. Achieving power transit without additional tariff through, and wholesale 
power TPA inside, Belgium.

Subject: European Priorities

Could each of you get me by next Friday( May 18,2001) a list of the top 5 
priorities for each of your respective areas....and, if, possible, a 
consensus document reflecting the top 8-10 priorities for the entire group? A 
brief description of each of the priorities would be appreciated with an 
attempt to quantify, where possible, the value associated with each of the 
priorities( either value potentially created or loss of value avoided). 
Thanks.
