FYI, I talked to Johnny Hayes yesterday, and he advised me that he has a 
strong relationship with Baxter. Baxter and he have supposedly already spoken.

Regards,

Ben

We understand President Bush intends to appoint Bill Baxter of Tennessee to 
fill a vacancy on the TVA board.  Our firm has represented Mr Baxter's 
company, Holston Gases.

The following is an article from NashvillePost.com, a local internet news 
service.

Former State ECD Head Gets Bush's TVA Nod

by Nicki Pendleton Wood

Wednesday, 7/11/2001 4:12 pm -

The White House today announced that President George W. Bush intends to 
nominate Knoxville businessman Bill Baxter to the board of Tennessee Valley 
Authority to serve out the remainder of Craven Crowell's term. His term will 
expire on May 18, 2002.

Mr. Baxter served as commissioner of the Tennessee Department of
Economic and Community Development after being appointed in 1997 by
Gov. Don Sundquist. He announced his resignation in December 2000.

He is chairman of Holston Gases, Inc., in Knoxville. Holston Gases sells
industrial and medical gases, propane, and welding supplies in seven cities
across the state.

Mr. Baxter has degrees from the University of Tennessee Law School and
Duke University.

Mr. Baxter has been an active donor to Republican causes. He gave $2000
to Bush for President in 1999; $2000 to Friends of Zach Wamp in 1997;
$1000 to Van Hilleary for Congress in 1997 and $500 to Van Hilleary for
Congress in 1998; $2000 to Frist 2000, Inc. in 1997; $1,000 to Rudolph
Giuliani's exploratory bid for New York senatorial seat (against Hillary
Clinton); and $2,499 to KOMPAC (Keep Our Majority Political Action) in
two separate gifts this year.
