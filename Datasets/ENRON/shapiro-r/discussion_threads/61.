Finally, the H-1B visa increase has passed the House and Senate and is on i=

way to the President for his signature.  Jane Allen reviewed the provisions=

of the legislation which meet Enron's requirements.  Enron has been a part =

legislation.

Thanks to Allison Navin and Amy Fabian for great support on this issue. =20

House Passes H-1B Visas; Bill Now Awaits Clinton's Signature
In a strangely abrupt end to the protracted and often rocky debate on H-1B=

visa increase legislation, the House late Tuesday approved a Senate-passed=

bill by voice vote, and sent the measure to the White House for President=

Clinton's signature.=20
The bill is largely designed to increase the number of skilled foreign=20
workers who can be hired by high technology companies, and Clinton has=20
pledged to sign it.=20
House Republican leaders made the decision late Tuesday to bring the H-1B=
=20
visa increase legislation up for debate and vote under a suspension of the=
=20
rules, just hours after the Senate had approved the identical legislation i=
n=20
a 96-1 vote. House leadership made the call after most members already had=
=20
left for the day--a move that invited criticism from some Democratic=20
legislators who complained about being caught off guard.=20
Democratic leaders were informed about an hour beforehand that floor debate=
=20
on the measure would begin. After a brief debate, the bill was approved by=

voice vote--even though House Republican leaders had initially said that th=

intended to bring the measure for a roll call vote today. The decision to=

second private meeting held among Majority Leader Armey, Rules Chairman=20

"I don't think there was much talk, if any, across the aisle," said one hig=

Smith was likewise displeased, although for different reasons. The Senate=

bill differs sharply from Smith's own version of the legislation, which was=

congratulated Dreier, but insisted there was "no credible study" showing a=

Said a Smith aide: "Time ...has overtaken [efforts] to produce a balanced=

Lofgren, who said she had to be summoned back to Capitol Hill for Tuesday's=

Dreier acknowledged that debate on the bill had taken the two parties down =
