Rick - FYI - I was responsible for bring this company to David Cox and 
setting up the meeting referenced in the proposal attached.  At that meeting 
Cox basically offered UT&S a 10% commission if they could bring a cutomer to 
EBS.  Based on conversations that I have had with John DiDario, he has 
several customers to bring.  Revenues on 1 customer, on a 5 year deal exceeds 
$150 million.  I am concerned about feedback that I am getting about our 
"network".  I will discuss with you when I get back from vacation.
 On a related note, I am in the process of setting up a meeting between EBS 
and Global One (France Telecom).  GLobal One has indicated that they are 
interested in "all the bandwidth capacity" that we have to offer.  
I hope one or both of these close!
Steve
