Although Ken did not have an opportunity to raise steel directly with the 
Vice President because of time constraints, Ken did take an opportunity to 
speak with Bob Zoellick directly and at length about steel.  We ran into 
Zoellick in the West Wing as we were departing.  Zoellick told Ken that he 
understood our position.  He indicated general agreement with us, but did say 
that if he is able to "trade" steel for a larger political deal on fast track 
or something of that level, he would entertain putting steel into play.  
Zoellick indicated that he would glad to have his senior staff visit with us 
further on the issue.  Zoellick did not want to meet officially with us, 
given his former role as a Member of Enron's Advisory Committee.
