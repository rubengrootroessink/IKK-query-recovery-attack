At about the same time the National Association of Gas Consumers filed their 
complaint calling for a nationwide benchmark price for natural gas sales, the 
Los Angeles Department of Water and Power filed a petition for reimposition 
of the price cap on short-term capacity release and pipeline capacity 
transactions.  LADWP's petition was basically the same as the request for 
emergency relief filed by San Diego Gas & Electric in December, which FERC is 
still considering.  We have answered LADWP's petition incorporating our 
comments in San Diego and have asked that the two proceedings be consolidated 
since the issues are the same and parties have already expended a lot of time 
and effort in providing data to FERC in San Diego.

We did not receive FERC's notice on the LADWP petition that was issued Monday 
until yesterday, and responses are due today, so we did not have enough time 
to circulate our attached filing for review and comments.
