Einstein dies and goes to heaven. At the Pearly

> Einstein ponders for a few seconds and asks, "Could

> Saint Peter snaps his fingers and a blackboard and

> Saint Peter is suitably impressed. "You really ARE

> "Welcome to heaven!"
> 
> The next to arrive is Picasso. Once again, Saint

> Picasso asks, "Mind if I use that blackboard and

> 
> Saint Peter says, "Go ahead."
> 
> Picasso erases Einstein's equations and sketches a

> Saint Peter claps. "Surely you are the great artist

> Then Saint Peter looks up and sees George W. Bush.
> Saint Peter

> George W. looks bewildered and says, "Who are

> Saint Peter sighs and says, "Come on in, George."
