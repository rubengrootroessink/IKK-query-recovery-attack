FYI : this is the pack for the revised CE2 forecast for Gov Affairs.  It 
shows an 18% reduction on the original budget from $13.5m to $11.2m.  (CE1 
Forecast was $11.8m) . For rest of year, we merely scaled down T&E on the 
basis of the reduced headcount that had been given back in the CE1 forecast.  
(Forecast headcount to end of year is 25 vs 32 in original budget).  There 
may still be opportunities in Audit & Legal / Consultancy combined once we 
begin to review the contracts.
In Q2 we came in  $1.3m under the previous forecast, but we've just rephased 
that to the end of the year and kept it in the forecast on the basis that 
there may still be bills to come through.  Stephen Wood thinks that Michael 
may get tough and challenge why we can't release the underspend, but I think 
he ought to be sympathetic to our discussions on the possibility of a bigger 
regulatory battle later in the year and keep it in for that reason.

Doug, I know you just got back from leave, are you happy for Stephen to give 
this pack to Michael today/tomorrow?

Do you want to discuss or are you content to run with this? 
(the forecast is the same as when left to go on leave - I have just added 
some commentary).
thanks
Greg
