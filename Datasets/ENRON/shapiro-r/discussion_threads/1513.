Jeff --

A few other things that may be helpful. 

1. Mwhrs Sold and Total Revenues by Month (would be nice to have hourly 
info).  The Judge threw out a point that maybe the right answer was just 20% 
to Total Revenues.  I think that this would be horrible.

2. Reliant is providing to all other Sellers a Hourly Power Price using the 
March 9 FERC order.  Question - Can we determine from Oct 2000 - May 2001 the 
implications from this re-stating of prices?  Similar to the analysis last 
night, just different prices.

Thanks,

Jim
