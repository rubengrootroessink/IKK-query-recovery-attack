Rick - 

 I've printed the budget report for your cost center.  

The cost center report indicates that the budget for outside services if 
8,685,000 so we will need to talk to Elizabeth or someone in accounting why 
that number is not 9,000,000.  

The cost center report indicates that we have spent 1,137,638.34 for outside 
services which leaves a variance to budget of 7,547,361.66 available.  

The RCR Budget Report indicates that we have approved 2,235,071 year to 
date.  If you take the amount spent for outside services plus the amount 
approved to date for RCR's the total equals 3,372,709.34.  If you take the 
3,372,709.34 less budget the variance is 5,312,290.66 available.  That 
assumes that the approved to date RCR will all be spent in 2001 and does not 
account for what has been spent to date for RCR costs.

The budget report for your cost center indicates that actuals year to date 
equal 4,951,697.40 compared to an annual budget of 21,437,591 leaves a 
variance of 16,485,893.60 available for the year.

 I hope this information is helpful and is what you needed.  Call with any 
questions, comments or concerns.

Eric

Rick - I'm running the SAP report for March for your cost center and that 
will confirm the budget number and let you know how much was 
charged/coded/paid to date for outside services; the total budget for outside 
services is 9 million; I'll send another email with the budget information as 
soon as the reports print; the RCR budget report shows the variance between 
amount approved and budget but does not show the amount charged to date 
against those RCR's but I can run a report with that information; let me 
know; thanks - Eric

Rick - 

attached for your review and information is a quick spreadsheet that let's 
you know where we are on the RCR budget as of today.  Please advise if you 
would like this report sent to the other members of the RCR Committee. 



=================================

also - I have monthly reports for all except Jean Ryall and Aleck Dadson; I 
talked to Jean yesterday and she is working on the report and should have 
something to me by noon today; I talked to Aleck and he said that he has a 
new assistant and is working on the report but that the list of projects he 
provided for the direct reports meeting is still accurate and there are no 
changes; I'll send the resources report and the monthly reports received 
since my last email to your attention later today; call with any questions or 
if you need the information sooner than this afternoon

Eric
