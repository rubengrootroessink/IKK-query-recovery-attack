kitchen cabinet/advisory team, etc.

Greenberg Traurig, on january 1.  richards was just named lawyer of the year
by the American lawyer while abramoff is arguably the most influential and
effective gop lobbyist in congress.  i share several clients with him and
have yet to see him lose a battle.  he also is very close to Delay and could
help enormously on that front.  raised $ for bush.  until december 31 he can
be reached at 202-661-3851.  he assistant is Susan Ralston.
