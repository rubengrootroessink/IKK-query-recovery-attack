Rick,

Both CPUC draft decisions accept AReM's case -- 3 cent surcharge should NOT 
apply to DA.  Good for retail market. May be bad for UC/CSU case unless we 
keep them whole. By the way, I was the one who pushed AReM to get involved -- 
even though they hadn't been.  I got them to jump in a few days before 
testimony was due.
