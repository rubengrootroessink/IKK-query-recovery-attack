President Bush Reverses Position on CO2 Emissions

by Will McNamara=20
Director, Electric Industry Analysis

[News Item from The Washington Post, March 14] President Bush has decided n=
ot=20
to seek reductions in the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of the nation's=20
power plants, reversing himself on a campaign pledge after encountering=20
strong resistance from the coal and oil industries and from Republican alli=
es=20
on Capitol Hill. In a letter to four Republican senators, Bush cited a rece=
nt=20
Energy Department study showing that restrictions on CO2 emissions would=20
result in a shift from coal to natural gas and lead to higher energy costs.=
=20
"I do not believe=01(that the government should impose on power plants mand=
atory=20
emissions for carbon dioxide," Bush said.=20

Analysis: The sudden change in President Bush's position on CO2 emissions=
=20
naturally has elicited strong reactions from both sides of the debate. The=
=20
extent to which CO2 contributes to the nation's pollution, and whether or n=
ot=20
the government should take an active role in restricting CO2 emissions, has=
=20
become an intensely politicized issue. Democrats and environmental groups=
=20
responded with outrage to what they perceive as a betrayal by the president=
,=20
while coal and oil industry officials believe that Bush's decision will=20
ensure a more balanced energy and environmental policy.=20

I won't attempt to debate the political aspects of the president's decision=
.=20
Rather, I will analyze Bush's current position impacts the energy industry,=
=20
and whether or not the lifting of CO2restrictions does indeed contribute to=
 a=20
sound energy policy. =20

It is true that during his campaign, the president made promises to limit C=
O2=20
emissions. In a speech in late September, Bush said, "With the help of=20
Congress, environmental groups and industry, we will require all power plan=
ts=20
to meet clean air standards in order to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide,=
=20
nitrogen oxide, mercury and carbon dioxide within a reasonable period of=20
time." Yet, while many critics have claimed that Bush's refusal to place=20
limits on CO2 is a philosophical turnabout, White House spokesman Scott=20
McClellan said that carbon dioxide "should not have been included as a=20
pollutant" in Bush's campaign position because it is not classified as one =
in=20
the Clean Air Act. Further, the White House has said that Bush's original=
=20
promise was a "mistake" inconsistent with the president's broader goal of=
=20
increasing domestic energy production.=20

In fact, although many scientists believe that CO2 is a key contributor to=
=20
global warming, it has not been proven to have any direct effect on human=
=20
health. Consequently, CO2 has never been classified as a pollutant under th=
e=20
Clean Air Act because, in the eyes of those determining Clean Air=20
classifications, it has no detrimental human health or environmental impact=
,=20
except as it applies to concerns about global warming. In his decision to=
=20
abstain from placing any restrictions on CO2 emissions, Bush noted "the=20
incomplete state of scientific knowledge of the causes of, and solutions to=
,=20
global climate change and the lack of commercially available technologies f=
or=20
removing and storing carbon dioxide." The president maintains that he is=20
committed to an energy policy that would seek to improve air quality=20
emissions of NOx, SO2 and mercury, which are already regulated as pollutant=
s,=20
but not CO2. Bush also said that he would work with Congress to reduce=20
emissions from power plants specifically, but that any such strategy would=
=20
include phased-in reductions and market-based incentives to help the indust=
ry=20
meet the targets. =20

Moreover, the president apparently cannot reconcile any possible restrictio=
ns=20
on CO2 emissions with ramifications that the restrictions might have on=20
domestic power supply. Clearly, any limits on CO2 emissions would have=20
tremendous impact on coal-burning power plants. By some estimates, coal, a=
=20
relatively cheap and plentiful fuel which accounts for more than 50 percent=
=20
of the electricity generated in the United States, produces about 40 percen=
t=20
of the nation's CO2 output (more than any other fuel). Yet, industry=20
officials have warned the president that any effort to restrict CO2 emissio=
ns=20
would compromise efforts to increase domestic energy production. Since Bush=
=20
took office as president in January, it has become increasingly clear that =
a=20
major component of the president's imminent energy plan will be efforts to=
=20
increase domestic power supply through a diverse fuel mix that includes coa=
l,=20
natural gas and nuclear. The president has maintained that he sees a=20
supplemental role for renewable energies such as wind and solar. However,=
=20
according to reports out earlier this week, Bush is proposing to cut the=20
DOE's renewable fuels and energy efficiency budget by 30 to 40 percent. In=
=20
any case, establishing this diverse fuel mix will take time, and the=20
president realizes that the country faces an immediate energy crisis=20
resulting from a growing supply / demand imbalance. =20

Aside from power supply concerns, the president also acknowledged the curre=
nt=20
high prices for natural gas, and how a reduction in coal-fired generation=
=20
would most likely keep prices at their high levels. In fact, the president=
=20
said that conclusions made in a recent DOE report led to his decision to ba=
ck=20
away from CO2 restrictions, more than any pressure he might have received=
=20
from oil and coal lobbying groups, as has been reported in many recent news=
=20
articles. Bush noted that the DOE study had concluded that regulating CO2=
=20
emissions would have led to "significantly higher electricity prices." The=
=20
translation of this is that, if restrictions were to be placed on=20
coal-burning plants, many power suppliers would turn to natural-gas=20
production as an alternative. Natural-gas supplies are already compromised =
in=20
this country due to increasing demand, which has driven prices up to=20
unprecedented levels. Bush's decision reflects the concern that, if power=
=20
suppliers begin turning from coal to natural gas in larger numbers, this wi=
ll=20
continue to exacerbate the supply shortage and keep prices alarmingly high.=
=20
"This is important new information that warrants a re-evaluation, especiall=
y=20
at a time of rising energy prices and a serious energy shortage," President=
=20
Bush said. =20

The DOE report also indicated that because coal-fired power plants are the=
=20
major power sector emitters of CO2, compliance with the emission caps would=
=20
be expected to have a major impact on coal consumption and production, both=
=20
nationally and regionally. If CO2caps were to be put into place, substantia=
l=20
reductions in coal consumption would result, according to the DOE, with=20
corresponding drops in the projections for coal production. Further, becaus=
e=20
coal has a carbon content more than 70 percent higher per Btu than that of=
=20
natural gas, the DOE report said that the carbon allowance fees related to=
=20
CO2 caps would make the continued operation of many existing coal plants=20
uneconomical.=20

In addition to the DOE report, Bush continues to be counseled by an energy=
=20
advisory team, including Vice President Cheney and Energy Secretary Spencer=
=20
Abraham, as well as having the ear of other members of the Republican Party=
.=20
Many Republican senators, including Jesse Helms (North Carolina) and Chuck=
=20
Hagel (Nebraska) expressed alarm over Bush's campaign promises to reduce CO=
2=20
emissions out of concern that the promises were a step closer to ratifying =
an=20
international treaty regarding pollution control. The Kyoto Protocol,=20
negotiated and signed by the Clinton administration but still not ratified,=
=20
would commit 38 industrialized countries to ongoing cuts in CO2 (along with=
=20
SO2 and NOx) emissions. Negotiations over the Protocol broke down last=20
November, but are expected to resume this July. If ratified, the Protocol=
=20
would limit CO2 emissions below 1990 levels. Currently, CO2 emissions in th=
e=20
United States are about 12 percent over 1990 levels. Reportedly, Sens. Helm=
s=20
and Hagel oppose ratification of the Kyoto Protocol because they believe it=
=20
could adversely impact the economy and allow American energy policy to be=
=20
directed by an international treaty. =20

It is important to note how the president's new stand on CO2 emissions=20
relates to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Just two weeks ago, t=
he=20
U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the EPA has the power to issue new standards=
=20
designed to reduce the levels of smog and soot in the air. However, the EPA=
=20
does not currently regulate CO2 emissions. EPA Administrator Christine=20
Whitman, in a series of public statements, had vehemently defended and=20
supported President Bush's previously espoused commitment to controlling CO=
2=20
emissions. =20

Meanwhile, the president's change in policy precedes several bi-partisan=20
bills that are expected to be introduced in the House and Senate this week.=
=20
The measures reportedly will provide incentives and set requirements to=20
modernize power plants and reduce emissions of CO2, SO2 and NOx. Given the=
=20
president's new stance, however, the prospects for these bills gaining much=
=20
momentum may diminish.=20

In summary, President Bush apparently felt the need to give priority to=20
short-term resolutions to the nation's energy crisis over long-term=20
environmental concerns. Given the fact that coal presently generates more=
=20
than half of the nation's energy needs, the fossil fuel=01*despite its deba=
ted=20
environmental impacts=01*is a critical component of the U.S. energy supply.=
=20
Realizing that growing demand continues to compromise the country's power=
=20
supply, it appears that Bush made the unpopular decision to allow the heavy=
=20
reliance on coal to continue, at least for the near term. While some will=
=20
continue to say that the president reneged on his original campaign promise=
s=20
and was unduly influenced by oil and gas lobbyists, an argument can be made=
=20
that the nation's supply problems have worsened since last fall when the=20
president was campaigning. After examining the mix of current factors=01*
including consistently high natural-gas prices, demand that remains on the=
=20
rise and a continued reliance on coal, which remains comparatively=20
inexpensive=01*it is understandable that the president would take this posi=
tion.=20
However, the general consensus among scientists is that CO2 emissions=20
contribute to global warming, and that a long-term solution to curb CO2=20
emissions must be enacted.  As President Bush unveils his energy plan over=
=20
the next few weeks, it will be interesting to see how or if he addresses th=
e=20
issue of CO2 emissions from a long-term perspective. =20
