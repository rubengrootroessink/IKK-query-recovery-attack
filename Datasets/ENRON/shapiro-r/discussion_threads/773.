I've arranged 2 meeting in Paris on with EFET- France re gas issues. The 
agenda will include our take on what is going on in the US and French Gas 
issues. I have a feeling unfortunately that this meeting will not be well 
attended as we set it up farley late. Caroline Lambinon from Dalkia (French 
ESP with EDF, Vivendli ownership) is the only person that has responded. 

The second meeting is with the French regulator. Again the opportunity to 
meet with them is based on the Cal experience. Michel Massoni will be present 
with others yet to be determined.   Massoni is the director for the 
department in charge of  relations with Third Parties. I will forward you 
more information on the French market. I will also be present at the meeting 
on Tuesday at the EU.
