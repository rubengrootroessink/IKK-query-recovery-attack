Eva,

No problem, as well as general European scen it may be topical to pick up on 
a couple of issues re' "Benelux" namely recent price spikes and actions that 
need to be taken to improve working of Dutch market (transparency on cross 
border, market power etc)  AND (linked) proposal by Electrabel to combine the 
Dutch and Belgium grids ie nice idea, devil in the detail such that need to 
solve causes of price spike issue before or as a condition of linking the 2 
grids.

Obviously Peter would need to present things a little more elegantly but that 
would be key messages.

Ross

Ross, Julie,

There are a few Brussels-based corerspondents we haven't dealt with yet with 
whom we would like to start building a relationship.  In general, we pitch 
for one-to-one media briefings with Peter Styles that cover general EU energy 
issues with sometimes a bit of a national angle.

Would the time be right at the moment to do this with some of the Dutch and 
Spanish correspondents or are there any sensitivities that we need to keep in 
mind? Ross, I already checked with Teun who said that he did not see any 
problems with this.

Please advise because we would like to get on with our "pan-European PR 
programme".

Many thanks
Eva
