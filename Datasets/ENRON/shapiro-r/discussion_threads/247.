RE: FERC Orders Issued April 6th (1) CalPX Chargebacks;
(2)CalPX  Rate Recalculations; and (3) Kern River
Certificate

We want to inform you of three significant orders FERC issued today, two 
relating to the California Power Exchange (CalPX), and the third concerning a 
pipeline project from Wyoming to California.

(1) Pacific Gas & Electric Company v. California Power Exchange Corporation, 
et al. (Docket Nos. EL01-29/33/36/37/43-000) "Order on Complaints Concerning 
Use of Chargebacks and Liquidation of Collateral"
In this order, the Commission addressed five complaints against the CalPx 
concerning its response to alleged defaults by Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) 
and Southern California Edison Company (SoCal Edison).  Among other things, 
the Commission determined that "the chargeback provision in the PX tariff was 
not designed to address default of this magnitude and, thus, its application 
in these circumstances is unjust and unreasonable."  Accordingly, the 
Commission directed the CalPX to rescind all prior chargeback actions and 
refrain from any future chargeback actions relating to PG&E and SoCal 
Edison's liabilities, subject to further Commission action in accordance with 
the order.
Regarding the ultimate question of how the PX should account for the 
nonpayments by SoCal Edison and PG&E, the Commission deferred further action 
pending the outcome of SoCal Edison's State Court Complaint, as well as the 
Government Claims Board Complaint.  Finally, with respect to the PX's 
bankruptcy proceeding, the Commission concluded that section 362(b)(4) of the 
Bankruptcy Code allowed it to lawfully exercise its regulatory power under 
sections 205 and 206 of the Federal Power Act, so long as it did not threaten 
the bankruptcy court's control over the property of the bankruptcy estate.

(2) San Diego Gas & Electric Company v. Sellers of Energy and Ancillary 
Services (Docket Nos. EL00-95-015/016 and Docket Nos. EL00-98-014/015) "Order 
Dismissing Rehearing, Accepting Compliance Filing, and Directing the 
Recalculation of Lower Wholesale Rates"
In this order, the Commission dismissed the CalPX's request for rehearing of 
the Commission's January 29, 2001 order, which found that the CalPX had 
violated the Commission's December 15, 2000 order and the Federal Power Act.  
The December 15 order required the CalPX to pay suppliers in the CalPX 
markets their as-bid price above the $150/MWh breakpoint.  Additionally, the 
Commission accepted the PX's compliance filing and provided guidance to the 
PX on an acceptable methodology so that the PX may implement the $150/MWh 
breakpoint for its January 1, 2001 invoices.  Additionally, as in the 
chargeback case, the Commission determined that its action in the instant 
case was exempt from the automatic stay provision of the Bankruptcy Code.

(3) Kern River Gas Transmission Company (Docket No. CP01-106-000) "Order 
Issuing Certificate"
Pursuant to section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act, the Commission denied the 
protests that had been filed and issued a certificate of public convenience 
and necessity to Kern River authorizing it to construct and operate its 
California Action Project, subject to resolution of the proceeding pending in 
Docket No. CP01-61-000.  However, the Commission rejected Kern River's 
proposal to utilize a return on equity for this project of 15.25 percent.  
Instead, the Commission directed Kern River to file a revised incremental 
rate to reflect a return on equity of 13.25 percent at least 30 days prior to 
commencing service.  Finally, the Commission conditioned the certificate on 
Kern River's compliance with the environmental conditions set forth in 
Appendix C to the order.
