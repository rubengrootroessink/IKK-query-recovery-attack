Rick, I attach a copy of a report the regulatory group prepared for John=20
Sherriff on EPower's projects.=20

The conclusions reached are consistent with our initial estimates. EPower h=
as=20
adopted best case scenario timelines for their projects. The likely scenari=
o=20
is that unless there are significant and immediate changes to the current=
=20
regime for power plant development in Japan, EPower's greenfields projects=
=20
may not come on line before 2011. The brownfields sites avoid some of the p=
re=20
development issues, but in other respects are no less problematic.
The paper sets out 9 possible steps to assist EPower to reduce the time and=
=20
costs associated with the approval process and transmission access.
The first is one previously mentioned  - leverage existing relationships=20
within METI, with local Governors and within senior levels of the LDP to fo=
rm=20
a central organization with responsibility for coordinating and streamlinin=
g=20
the regulatory process for new entrants. We would anticipate that the centr=
al=20
organization would have delegated representatives in local METI branches an=
d=20
prefectural governments.
Others include lobbying for equal status for independent power projects und=

the Electricity Law and looking at the possibility of inviting utilities to=

participate as project equity partners in some or all of EPower=01,s projec=
