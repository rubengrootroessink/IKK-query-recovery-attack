This is the latest version of a presentation Jan and Mike are working on for 
Anthony Duenner's off-site next week.  They give a good overview of 
regulatory issues in the region.  Also, Jan, Mike and I have a call scheduled 
for 7:30 Thursday morning to go over these in more detail.  You're welcome to 
join us if your schedule permits.

Choon-Boon,

Please find enclosed the result of our common effort. 
Mike an I will share the presentation on regulatory affairs.

Mike:
I tried to put most of your latest stuff in this version and I trust you are 
fine with it.
If not, please let Appolina know by Monday, midday. I will have no more input 
although I think Taiwan would need some more attention.

Appol:   If there is nothing more coming from Mike, could you please print 
them out  (20 issues) and put them in binders ?
Thanks.
