Rick/Mark:

Thought you might want to see the concept board that SSK came up with.  
Please see note below, which SSK sent to a Constellation employee who 
couldn't attend the meeting last week.

lindy:

thanks for the input.

also, per your request from yesterday, attached please find a PDF file with 
the visual concept board that was presented at last friday's meeting.  again, 
as we discussed, this is NOT an ad, and it's not intended to be presented as 
an ad, despite the fact that it very much looks like an ad.  rather, it's an 
illustration of how the research-based strategic insights to this complex 
issue can be distilled down to a single-minded concept with an easy visual 
read.  as i mentioned yesterday, i am concerned that anyone who will view 
this ad out of context could misconstrue what it is and what its purpose is.

thanks again,

jonathan
