		 Subject: Lay/Lavorato Meetings - June 19th

We now have confirmed the following meetings for Lay and Lavorato: a) Wilson, 
Purchase and Hubert at 2:15 pm  ( Minister's Boardroom is booked  so location 
yet to be determined, but likely in Macdonald Block)  and b) Premier Harris  
and staff at 3:45 pm ( Premier's Office, 6th Floor, Whitney Block).   
Macdonald and Whitney Blocks about a two minute walk apart.   We will likely 
be out of the Premier's Office by 4:30 pm.  As I mentioned in an earlier 
e-mail, the only other meeting I would suggest, if you think there is time,  
would be with Floyd Laughren, chair of the OEB.   Our collective opinion of 
Laughren may not be high but he is obviously a key player in the  ultimate 
decision to move forward.  Let me know whether you want me to try to arrange 
that meeting or whether you think the other two meetings are sufficient.
