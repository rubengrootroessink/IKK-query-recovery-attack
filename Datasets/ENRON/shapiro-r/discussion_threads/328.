Mark Weinberger, Assistant Secretary of Treasury of Tax Policy, stated this 
morning that the Treasury Department will release it no-rule policy on 
synthetic fuels to the Federal Register this afternoon.  We will get you more 
information immediately, but the preliminary information is that this will 
allow the IRS to again issues Private Letter Rulings (PLR) on synthetic fuels.
