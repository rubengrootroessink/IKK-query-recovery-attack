I have forwarded separately GA top 10 goals for EES.  While there will be 
need for refinement and additional discussion, I would like to see us start 
now to develop strategies for these goals.  Below I've suggested people in 
our organization who could serve as "issue leaders"  who could take on the 
task of more fully defining the goal, developing the strategy, and developing 
the metric by which performance is measured.  I would work with these people 
and do whatever necessary to coordinate, direct, etc. 

Are you ok with this approach and with the designated leads?  (Suggested 
leads are shown on the last page)  I think many of these goals are also good 
categories to state previous results.



For example, one of the goals we should move on quickly (which you have 
mentioned to me) and which is listed as #10 is the "improve communication".  
We could do this initially through the monthly newsletter and perhaps a 
client survey which measures EES Mgmt.'s satisfaction with GA.  I would think 
and like if someone with some PR pizazz could take these and run with them.  
The newsletter should look professional and, I think, be a joint publication 
with EES (which I've talked to Peggy Mahoney about). It would be great if the 
first edition could be out in a couple ow weeks.

All of the other goals pretty much have a similar story - some immediate need 
which needs a lot of attention.  I think we would be most effective enlisting 
the right people to champion each of these.
