After our discussion at lunch last Thursday, I think I need more advice from 
you on how to deal with the sort of intervention you can see below!! I tried 
really hard to cover all the bases on this initiative, nearly all face to 
face. Then Paul H didn't turn up at the staff meeting on Monday and I get the 
e-mailed questions you see below (when he could have come to chat to me about 
it.) I will of course try to smooth over things verbally with Paul, but if 
this is what happens when I "give up" 30% of the time of a direct report to 
benefit her career development and the company's biz. priorities, you will 
understand some frustration on my part at our current arrangements!!

Subject: Nailia's opportunity to work more on the trading floor  

I have made no formal request to HR for housing, Paul. As you know, I have 
agreed with Eric Shaw, Paul Mead, Paul Dawson and Alfredo Huertas that Nailia 
will spend c. 30% of her time in the next six months working on Italian reg. 
issues, and that to facilitate that role and to help her get better exposure 
to commercial teams on EU issues too, she will spend on average three days a 
week over that period on the trading floor, next to the Italian team. (We 
announced all of this in the staff meeting yesterday.)  

Her travel to London tends to be weekly already, and is done on a very 
reasonable Eurostar youth fare basis. I think the budget question then is 
simply: Is it more efficient for the company to pay for a hotel room two, 
three or four nights a week or to allow Nailia to take a cheap flat share? 
The latter may well work out better, especially taking into account the 
flexibility it will allow. I am told Tara Rozen has a suggestion. Let's see 
the comparison; then I agree the four of us should judge together. I'll keep 
you informed. Give me a call if you have any other concerns about any aspect 
of the arrangements.

Peter.

Peter

I understand from Sophie Kingsley that a request has been placed with her to 
secure housing for
Nailia in London for a few days each week for the next several months. I have 
discussed this with Doug and Paul.
We would like to discuss this with you to understand the thinking behind this 
as well as the expense. It seems reasonable
in these days of cost cutting that we make these decisions jointly. Thanks

Paul
