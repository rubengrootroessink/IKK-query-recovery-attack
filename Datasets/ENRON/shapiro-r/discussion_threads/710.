Carin / Tom,

Please find following document containing main suggested briefing points re 
Polish energy market for GW's visit in June, prepared by Doug with input from 
the rest of the Polish team.

If you have any further questions, it would probably be best to 'reply all' 
and the relevant expert will contact you.

Kind regards

Andrew
