From my "now Californian" sister-in-law.   How quickly she forgets where she
came from.  Nevermind that I guess the rest of the country can keep all the
subsidy money we give California to pay for all the things listed
below....or maybe we should send California a bill for all the insurance and
reinsurance and federal money that has to pay all the clean up after
California experiences an earthquake.

Thought you'd enjoy...

   America has engaged in some finger wagging lately because

   California doesn't have enough electricity to meet its needs.  The

   rest of the country (including George W. Bush's energy secretary

   Spencer Abraham, who wants Californians to suffer through

   blackouts as justification for drilling for oil in Alaska's Arctic

   National Wildlife Refuge) seems to be just fine with letting

   Californians dangle in the breeze without enough power to meet

   their needs.  They laugh at Californians' frivolity.



   Here's how it really is:



   California ranks 48th in the nation in power consumed per person.

   California grows more than half the nation's fruit, nuts and vegetables.

   We're keeping them.  We need something to eat when the power

   goes out.  We grow 99 percent or more of the nation's almonds,

   artichokes, dates, figs, kiwifruit, olives, persimmons, pistachios,

   prunes, raisins and walnuts.



   Hope you won't miss them.



   California is the nation's number one dairy state.  We're keeping our

   dairy products.  We'll need plenty of fresh ones since our refrigerators

   can't be relied upon.  Got milk?



   We Californians are gonna keep all our high-tech software in state.

   Silicon Valley is ours, after all.  Without enough electricity, which

   you're apparently keeping for yourselves, we just plain don't have enough

   software to spare.

   We're keeping all our airplanes.  California builds a good percentage of
   the
   commercial airliners available to fly you people to where you want to go.
   When yours wear out, you'd better hope Boeing's Washington plant can keep
   you supplied.  There isn't enough electricity here to allow us to export
   any more
   planes than we need ourselves.  And while we're at it, we're keeping all
our

   high-tech aerospace stuff, too, like the sophisticated weapons systems

   that let you sleep at night, not worried you might wake up under

   the rule of some foreign kook.



   Oh, yeah, and if you want to make a long-distance call, remember

   where the satellite components and tracking systems come from.

   Maybe you could get back in the habit of writing letters.



   Want to see a blockbuster movie this weekend?  Come to California.

   We make them here. Since we'll now have to make them with our own

   electricity, we're keeping them.  Even if we shot them somewhere

   else, the labs, printing facilities, editing facilities, and sound

   facilities are all here.



   Want some nice domestic wine?  We produce over 17 million gallons

   per year.  We'll need all of it to drown our sorrows when we think

   about the fact that no matter how many California products we export to

   make the rest of America's lives better, America can't see its way

   clear to help us out with a little electricity.  You can no longer have
any
   of

   our wine.



   You all complain that we don't build enough power plants.  Well,

   you don't grow enough food, write enough software, make enough movies,

   build enough airplanes and defense systems or make enough wine.



   This is your last warning, America.  Lighten (us) up before it's

   too late.



   Love,

   The Californians
