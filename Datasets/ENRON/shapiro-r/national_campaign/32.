Local Public radio over the weekend had a story that Gov Davis, once seen for 
dead on the national front, has risen from the dead now that he has gone on 
the attack against Bush's energy plan -- I don't agree that he has riden yet, 
but that is certainly his plan.

Link is for an Orange County register article that discusses his Gore hires 
and notes his Washington strategy.
