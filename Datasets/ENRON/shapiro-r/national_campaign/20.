here's juleanna's take on the nyt quote, fyi.  i wouldn't press them on the
correction.  (and didn't think it would hurt to share her extraneous comment
with my client, either!) best, ed g.

i'll make sure the people that matter know the quote was wrong.  no need to
publicly clarify, unless it is mandatory from the client's perspective.

i'd love to see you some day soon, too.  you're really relied upon around
here ... hear your name all the time in connection w. tough issues, but you
know that already.
