There are two open Republican seats on the CFTC.  The White House is interviewing prospective candidates.  The leading candidates are:  Walt Luken, Professional Staff Member on the Senate Agriculture Minority Staff; Ryan Weston, Professional Staff on the House Agriculture Majority Staff; and Sharon Brown-Hruska, an economist with the Mercatur Center and friend of Wendy Gramm's.

I have been asked by Walt Luken to be a reference for his candidacy.  Walt was instrumental in the CFMA, especially on the energy/metals exemption and is a pro-market supporter.  Linda and I know Walt well and believe he would be a good candidate.  Lisa has met with Walt.  We know his philosophical background and he is a friend of Enron.  I would like to be able to help him by being a reference.

Ryan Weston is also a friend of Enron and is pro-market.  His somewhat less experienced that Walt, but would be a good choice as well..

We do not know much about Sharon Brown-Hruska expect she worked at the CFTC from 1990-1995 and holds a PhD in Finance.  Steve and Rick - Could you find out if we have made a commitment to Wendy Gramm on Brown-Hruska.  

An ideal combination for the CFTC, would be to have Walt and/or Ryan.  However, there is some consensus that a Commissioner with a strong financial background would be beneficial.  

Please advise.
