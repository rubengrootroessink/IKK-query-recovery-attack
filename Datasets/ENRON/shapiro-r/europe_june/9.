Background

The Continental European electricity market is developing from an integrate=
d=20
monopoly business to a competitive market. A segment of electricity users n=
ow=20
have the right to choose their supplier from a range of marketers. The=20
emergence of new marketers and generators has created the demand for price=
=20
risk management solutions and has encouraged the development of a traded=20
wholesale market. Following the adoption of the EU Electricity Directive in=
=20
December 1996, member states were obliged to transpose the directive into=
=20
national legislation opening electricity markets to competition by February=
=20
1999.

The directive sets out a three-tiered approach to the liberalisation of=20
electricity supply markets. Stage one entered into effect on 19 February=20
1997, and calls for the opening of 22% of national markets, based on the=20
average community share of electricity consumed by end customers using more=
=20
than 40 GWh per year. The degree of opening will increase over six years by=
=20
lowering the community consumption threshold to 20 GWh in 2000 (27% market=
=20
opening) and to 9 GWh in 2003 (32-33% market opening). Distributor access i=
s=20
a matter for each member state. The implementation of a new directive,=20
expected in 2002, will improve the conditions for a liberalized market.

At present, the level of compliance with the directive varies between membe=
r=20
states. The EU countries farthest along the process of liberalisation are=
=20
Germany, Austria, Spain and the Netherlands. Switzerland, although it is no=
t=20
an EU member state, is integral to market developments. France, although=20
having chosen to comply with the minimum requirements of the directive, has=
=20
proven to open up their market more than expected.   =20

Current Market

EDF is the dominant electricity producer in France, the largest power=20
producer in the world with 475TWh generated in 2000,  and the largest=20
exporter in Europe (net exports reached 71 TWh in 2000).  Power generation =
in=20
France is mainly nuclear (70%), but also hydro (20%), while conventional=20
thermal generation represents 10%. EDF is a vertically integrated company=
=20
with services and products in generation (92%), supply (?%), transmission a=
nd=20
distribution (95%). Finally, this historical supplier is a State Entity; th=
e=20
French State owns EDF=01,s capital.  A few Independent Power Producers (IPP=
) are=20
also active in the market, such as Snet (6.4TWh, coal-fired), and CNR (16TW=
h,=20
hydro). Other smaller IPPs are commercially active but most must sell their=
=20
production to EDF under a regulated tariff.=20

More than 100 distribution companies are active through a concession regime=
=20
in their local distribution area. Few, however, are of a significant size=
=20
(less than a dozen have sales of over 400 GWhs), or have eligible customers=
=20
in their concession areas.

The French System Operator (RTE) was created on 1 July 2000 and is a=20
sub-division of EDF, although it is unbundled in terms of management and=20
accounting. A postage stamp tariff has been implemented under the=20
transitional regime, which varies according to the voltage used and is base=
d=20
on a matrix (Summer/Winter, Peak/Off-Peak). Users have to contract for thei=
r=20
maximum transmission capacity. Imbalances are settled under a published=20
tariff, which introduces high charges for imbalances beyond a 10% tolerance=
=20
level and 5MW.=20

A three-year framework contract (e.g., by way of a Master Agreement with a=
=20
minimum term of three years) is required for eligible customers, but=20
eligibles are free to deal for shorter maturity transactions within such a=
=20
three-year contractual framework. =20

Although the criteria for eligibility is per site, and eligible customers=
=20
have to contract transmission for each site, RTE has created balancing=20
responsibility contracts (contrats de Responsable d'Equilibre) which compel=
s=20
the aggregation of imbalance charges for different eligible sites within an=
=20
equilibrium perimeter defined with RTE. Imbalances are settled under a=20
published tariff which charges a heavy penalty for any imbalance beyond a 1=
0%=20
tolerance level or 5MW.=20

Even though we are currently under a transitional regime in France, the=20
ability to trade power already exists. Optimisation can be found through=20
real-time arbitrage offered by the flexibility of the industrial process, t=
he=20
availability of market prices and optional structures. The establishment of=
=20
balancing responsibility contracts has created the basic conditions for an=
=20
effective power trading market in France, and this through the exchange of=
=20
blocks from one perimeter to another. Blocs are only exchangeable on=20
day-ahead bases but intra-day procedures are expected to be implemented. Al=
l=20
transactions are currently based on bilateral physical contracts.=20

The establishment of this framework has contributed to an increasing number=
=20
of players for trading, imports, exports and transit; we are confident that=
=20
the French power market will develop rapidly.     Enron Capital & Trade=20
Resources Limited ("ECTRL") is a balancing responsible actor in France and=
=20
closed the first physical power transaction in France early 2000, and was t=
he=20
very first new entrant to trade power (buy/sell) in France late 2000.   =20

Future Developments

France's size and geographical position will make it a natural hub for=20
trading on the Continent. It is Europe's second largest electricity market,=
=20
with net consumption (including industrial on-site consumption) totalling=
=20
over 400 TWh in 1999. The increase of physical trading, envisaged capacity=
=20
release by EDF, and creation of future market mechanism will contribute to=
=20
the further development of the market.

Both a balancing market and a spot exchange market are expected to be=20
implemented by end 2001. Players in the balancing market will propose put a=
nd=20
call options, exercised by RTE according to its own portfolio of contacts=
=20
(producer, consumer) and providing it with physical balancing capacity. The=
=20
balancing market will also show referenced market prices for balancing=20
services.
=20
Some of the spot market volume is expected to be operated by ParisBourse.=
=20
However, due to the dominant position of EDF, the limited number of active=
=20
IPPs, existing restrictions for trading for authorised producers in France,=
=20
and the lack of transparency with regard to current rules for allocation of=
=20
cross-border capacity and attribution of congestion costs, we believe that=
=20
the conditions for the creation of an effective spot power market in France=
=20
are not yet fully met.=20

Recently, the European Commission has asked EDF to auction 6,000MW of virtu=
al=20
capacity through VPP auctions starting in September 2001, representing abou=
t=20
30% of the market for French eligible industrials This will further=20
contribute to increase liquidity.=20

Regulatory Environment

The goal of Directive 96/92/EC concerning the internal market in electricit=
y=20
is to obtain a cheaper but secure electricity supply by introducing and=20
gradually expanding competition while maintaining industry competitiveness =
in=20
the face of price decreases. France has transposed the directive, however=
=20
certain imperfection with regards to non-discriminatory access and the leve=
l=20
of liberalisation still exist.=20

The French Electricity law was passed on 10 February 2000, a year later  th=
an=20
required by the EU, establishing a transitional regime for third party acce=
ss=20
(TPA). Several application decrees still have to be passed, including=20
transportation tariffs on the electric grid to eligible customers. The=20
current threshold for eligibility is 16GWh (net of auto-consumption) per ye=
ar=20
and per site, and represents about 600 eligible clients and 1,200 sites.=20
Eligibility for distribution companies is currently limited to the eligible=
=20
consumption of customers located in their concession areas. The French powe=
r=20
market is effectively open to some competition, and about 60 eligible=20
industrials have so far switched totally or partly from the historical=20
supplier. The eligibility threshold will be reduced to 9GWh per site by=20
direct application of the EU Directive by Feb. 2003, as the French governme=
nt=20
declined a quicker opening of the power market.

The two main authorities, which oversee the industry, are the CRE (Commissi=
on=20
de Regulation de l'Electricit,) is the official regulatory body and the=20
ministry of industry. The CRE is responsible to insure that RTE provides fo=
r=20
non-discriminatory access on to the grid and will be issuing transportation=
=20
tariffs.  The Ministry is responsible for providing generation licenses for=
=20
IPPs and for determining eligibility issues.      =20

RTE is implementing new capacity allocation procedures on the UK, Italy and=
=20
Spain interconnectors. On the remaining borders, capacity is currently=20
allocated on a first-come-first served basis rule, and congestion fees are=
=20
levied at the margin, which favours long-term contracts and historical=20
players. In addition, there is currently some lack of transparency with=20
regards to RTE real-time data on the capacity available/used for exports an=
d=20
imports. However an intra-day market is now effective for transits, imports=
=20
and exports.  The first come first serve allocation rule on border capacity=
=20
is likely to be changed by end 2001. In addition, the CRE is likely to=20
request RTE to release additional data in the months to come.  =20

New IPPs have to be authorised through auctions or through direct decision =
of=20
the Ministry of Industry, the main route for authorisation. Authorised IPPs=
=20
in France are limited by Decree to buying for resale to eligible customers =
a=20
maximum of buy for resale to eligible customers a volume equivalent to 20% =
of=20
the installed capacity, including long term contracts. Although the=20
interpretation of this law is unclear, a recent statement by M. Tuot,=20
Director General of the CRE, implies that these restrictions only apply to=
=20
French authorised producers and thus not to foreign-based energy companies =
or=20
other non-producing entities. Thus, these restrictions do not apply to ECTR=
L,=20
as we are not registered in France.  In addition, French IPPs are free to=
=20
sell and export their production.

Eligible customers, who are physically connected to the Grid, have to=20
contract for transmission vis-.-vis RTE (Contrat Made). Traders, such as=20
ECTRL, are not required to have such a transmission contract, as they do no=
t=20
consume the power they purchase. Only a balancing responsibility contract=
=20
coupled with grid access contracts (import, export, and/or transit) are=20
required by RTE. =20

A new Decree is expected to be passed by Summer 2001, setting up new=20
conditions for transmission, transits and exports under a permanent regime.=
=20
Imports, which are allocated on a pro-rata basis, are free of transmission=
=20

A network code is currently under discussion between market players and=20
RTE.      =20

Market Conventions

A range of wholesale electricity products are currently traded in France. =
=20
Peak and baseload day-ahead, week-ahead, monthly, quaterly, and yearly=20
products are traded.  Peak products follow the German convention (12 hour=

Other: The Gas Market

A transitional regime was implemented on 10 August 2000 by direct applicati=
on=20
of the EU Directive, thus establishing regulated TPA for sites whose=20
consumption is over 25 million cubic meters p.a. The eligibility threshold=
=20
will be reduced to 15million cubic meters in 2003, and 5 million cubic mete=

in 2008. No gas law has been passed yet (forecasted for mid 2002), and it i=
s=20
expected that the transitional regime for gas in France will last until end=
=20
2002. A zonal/distance-related tariff was published on 13 July 2000 by=20
GdF-Transportation. A permanent entry/exit tariff structure is likely to be=
=20
developed for 2003. Charges for imbalances are expensive and access to=20
storage is restricted. GdF-Trading, however, has published conditions for=
=20
balancing services.=20
There is only one trading Hub for France located at the French/Belgian bord=

Updated May 2001.

1)Background

France is the second largest country in Europe with 58 million inhabitants.=
=20
EdF, who was the monopolistic producer, is the largest power producer in th=
e=20
world with 475TWh generated in 2000, thanks to nuclear production. The=20
historical supplier, who is at the same time the largest exporter of power =
in=20
Europe (net exports reached 71TWh in 2000), is a direct emanation from the=
=20
French State, who owns EdF capital. Power generation in France is mainly=20
nuclear (70%), but also hydro (20%), while conventional thermal generation=
=20
represents 10%. EdF owns 92% of power generation, and 95% of distribution.=
=20

A few Independent Power Producers (IPP) are also active in the market, such=
=20
as Snet (6.4TWh, coal-fired), and CNR (16TWh, hydro). Other small IPPs sell=
=20
their production to EdF under a regulated tariff. There has been significan=
t=20
development of cogeneration projects since 1997. There is now 3,500MW of=20
installed capacity, thanks to the legal obligation for EdF to purchase powe=
r=20
generated from cogeneration units at a preferable (is "preferable" the=20
correct word??)   tariff. In the view of the transposition of  the EU=20
Electricity Directive into French law, this purchase obligation ceased to=
=20
apply for new large projects (over 12MW) from 1st Jan. 1999.
More than 100 distribution companies are active through a concession regime=
=20
in their local distribution area. Few, however, are of a significant size=
=20
(less than a dozen have sales of over 400 GWhs), or have eligible customers=
=20
in their concession area.

2) Regulatory Environment

The French Electricity law was passed on 10 February 2000, implementing=20
regulated third party access (TPA) in France under a transitional regime. T=
he=20
law was approved one year late, failing to meet the required EU deadline.=
=20
Dozens  ["Dozens"  - I would replace this with "Several")  of application=
=20
decrees still have to be passed, including tariffs to eligible industrials.=
=20
The French power market is open to competition, however. About 60 eligible=
=20
industrials have so far switched totally or partly from the historical=20
supplier. Current threshold for eligibility is 16GWh (net of=20
auto-consumption) per year and per site, representing about 600 eligible=20
clients and 1,200 sites. The eligibility threshold will be reduced to 9GWh=
=20
per site by direct application of the EU Directive in Feb. 2003, as the=20
French government declined a quicker opening of the power market.

Eligibility of distribution companies is limited to the eligible consumptio=
n=20
of customers located in their concession area. =20
A three-year framework contract ( e.g., by way of a Master Agreement with a=
=20
minimum term of three years) is required for eligible customers, but=20
eligibles are free to deal for shorter maturity transactions within such a=
=20
three year contractual framework. =20

New IPPs have to be authorised through auctions or through direct decision=
=20
from the Ministry of Industry, which is the main route for authorisation.=
=20
Authorised IPPs in France are limited by Decree to trading buy for resale t=
o=20
eligible customers a volume equivalent to 20% of the installed capacity,=20
including long term contracts. Trading is currently defined as the conditio=
ns=20
of power purchase for resale to eligible customers. These Trading=20
restrictions, however, do not apply to ECTRL, as we are not registered in=
=20
France. IPPs are free to sell and export power.

The French System Operator (RTE) was created on 1 July 2000 and is a=20
sub-division of EdF, although it is unbundled in terms of management and=20
accounting. A postage stamp tariff was implemented under the transitional=
=20
regime, which varies according to the voltage used,and which is based on a=
=20
matrix (Summer/Winter, Peak/OffPeak). Users have to contract transmission u=
p=20
to the maximum capacity that they will use. RTE purchases excess capacity=
=20
available through transmission contracts at fixed prices, which represents=
=20
about half of the market price. Imbalances are settled under a published=20
tariff, which introduces high charges for imbalances beyond a 10% tolerance=
=20
level and 5MW. Although the criteria for eligibility is per site, and=20
eligible customers have to contract transmission for each site, RTE has=20
created programme responsible contracts (contrats de Responsable=20
d'Equilibre), which allow the aggregation of imbalance charges for differen=
t=20
eligible sites within an equilibrium perimeter defined with RTE.

Eligible customers, who are physically connected to the Grid, have to=20
contract for transmission vis-.-vis RTE (Contrat Made). Traders, such as=20
ECTRL, are not required to have such a transmission contract, as they do no=
t=20
consume the power they purchase. Only a programme responsible contract=20
coupled with grid access contracts (import, export, and/or transit) are=20
required by RTE. =20

A new Decree is expected to be passed by Summer 2001, setting up new=20
conditions for transmission, transits and exports under a permanent regime.=
=20
It is likely that this new tariff will implement a 1/3 injection-2/3 delive=
ry=20
calculation factor. Imports, which are allocated on a pro-rata basis, are=
=20
free of transmission charges. =20

Programme responsible contracts have established the basis of trading in=20
France through the exchange of blocs from one perimeter to another.  Enron=
=20
Capital & Trade Resources Limited ("ECTRL")  is programme responsible in=20
France. Cross border capacity is currently allocated on a first-come-first=
=20
served basis rule by RTE, and congestion fees are levied at the margin, whi=
ch=20
favours long term contracts and does not give equal treatment to all player=
s.=20
In addition, there is currently some lack of transparency with regards to R=
TE=20
real-time data on the capacity available/used for exports and imports. This=
=20
allocation rule is likely to change by end 2001. In addition, the CRE is=20
likely to request RTE to release additional data in the months to come.  =
=20

The CRE (Commission de Regulation de l'Electricite) is the offical regulato=
ry=20
body, which mainly covers TPA and tariff issues, while IPP licenses and=20
eligibility issues are covered by the Ministry of Industry.      =20
      =20
3) Business Opportunity

Although we are currently under a transitional regime in France, the abilit=
y=20
to trade power already exists. Optimisation can be found through real-time=
=20
arbitrage between the flexibility of the industrial process, market prices=
=20
and optional structures. The establishment of programme responsible contrac=
ts=20
has created the basic conditions for an effective power trading market in=
=20
France. ECTRL closed the first physical power transaction in France early=
=20
2000, and was the very first new entrant to trade power (buy/sell) in Franc=
e=20
late 2000. =20

An intraday market is now effective for transits, imports and exports, and =
is=20
expected to soon be extended to exchange of blocs in France.=20
Liquidity has been dramatically increasing (although the market remains=20
dominated by the historical player) thanks to RTE capacity auctions for=20

A network code is currently under discussion between market players and=20
RTE.      =20

4) Future Development=20

It is forecasted that both balancing market and spot exchange market will b=
e=20
implemented by end 2001. Players in the balancing market will propose put a=
nd=20
call options, which will be exercised by RTE according to its own portfolio=
=20
of contacts (producer,consumer), thus providing RTE with physical balancing=
=20
capacity. The balancing market will also show referenced market prices for=
=20
balancing services.=20

The Some of the spot market volume is expected to be run by ParisBourse.=20
However, due to the dominant position of EdF, the limited number of active=
=20
IPPs, existing restrictions for trading for authorised producers in France,=
=20
and the lack of transparency with regard to current rules for allocation of=
=20
cross-border capacity and attribution of congestion costs, we believe that=
=20
the conditions for the creation of an effective spot power market in France=
=20
are not yet fully met. ECTRL has actively been lobbying in order to have fa=
ir=20
and transparent rules implemented for every player in the market and has=20
actively contributed for a spot market to take place.

However, thanks to an increasing number of players in France for trading,=
=20
imports, exports and transit, we are confident that the French power market=
=20
will develop rapidly.        =20

5) The Gas Market Situation

A transitional regime was implemented on 10 August 2000 by direct applicati=
on=20
of the EU Directive, thus establishing regulated TPA for sites whose=20
consumption is over 25 million cubic meters p.a. The eligibility threshold=
=20
will be reduced to 15million cubic meters in 2003, and 5 million cubic mete=
rs=20
in 2008. No gas law has been passed yet (forecasted mid 2002), and its is=
=20
expected that the transitional regime for gas in France will last until end=
=20
2002. A zonal/distance-related tariff was disclosed published on 13 July 20=
00=20
by GdF-Transportation. A permanent entry/exit tariff structure is likely to=
=20
be developed for 2003.  Charges  for imbalances are expensive, and access t=
o=20
storage is restricted. GdF-Trading, however, has published conditions for=
=20
balancing services.=20
There is only one trading Hub for France located at the French/Belgian bord=
er=20
(Blaregnies/TaisniSres). Due to the distance-related nature of the=20
transportation tariff, competitive TPA is limited to eligible sites which a=
re=20
located not too far (less than about 250Km) from the French/Belgian border.=
=20
The main imports into France are for high cal gas, and GdF has published th=
e=20
conditions for high cal/low cal gas swaps.
As there is not yet a  [new??] gas law in France ( a Projet de Loi was=20
approved on 17th May 2000) transposing the EU Gas Directive into domestic=
=20
legislation, the Regulatory Commission has not been appointed to-date , and=
