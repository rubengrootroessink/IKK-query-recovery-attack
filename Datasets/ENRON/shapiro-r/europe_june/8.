Philip

Attached the relevant sections of a paper produced by EFET (largely by us) on 
TPA in the French gas market and Enron comments to the EU on TPA issues. Note 
that these papers were produced in December of 2000 and mid-Feb 2001 
respectively. Notable changes since then include.

A relatively competitively priced conversion service (H-Cal to L-Cal gas) at 
TaiseniSres has been but in place 
The balancing regime has been improved and penalties are now indexed to 
Zeebrugge (x 1.5 or x -0.5)
Access conditions to LNG have been published
Flexibility services are offered by GdF- Supply. The terms and conditions up 
to now had been onerous. Recent talks between Didier and a customer suggest 
that they have been wildly improved but this still needs to analysed by us.
Transit tariffs have been published but is also restricted to a  year-long. 
The regulator is seriously considering changing the tariff structure from a 
distance related structure to a entry/exit type structure.
The first hearing on the law (directive transposition) at the parliament has 
been delayed from spring 2001 to summer 2002. Regulated tariffs will not 
likely be put in place until 2003.

Let me know if you need more information.
