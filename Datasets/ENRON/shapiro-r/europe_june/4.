Take a look at attachment below for guidance in any discussion with Ristori 
next Wednesday re Bush energy policy statement and comparative aspects of EC 
green paper on sec. of supply. To remind you of what Loyola said on CNN 
yesterday:
 - Agrees with need to re-evaluate role of nuclear plus future investment in 
it .
 - Disagrees with weight given to supply side and indigenous sources, 
compared with demand side and fuel diversity (also from external sources?)
 - Disagrees with exclusion of climate change considerations.

Jan, please find a revised draft of the SoS paper following discussions with
Peter. I would be grateful if you could circulate it to the members of the
electricity working group for comment by 30th April. Likewise could you also
forward it to Ian Wood.
(See attached file: efetsos.doc)



Thanks Brian
