Hi Ben,

Attached is an analysis of the regulatory rules and requirements relative to 
merchant power plants in Florida and Indiana.



I will be happy to answer any questions you may have.
 
Regards,
Gloria.

Bob:

Sounds like a good start. What I'm interested in is the timing and risk 
associated with obtaining a CCN, and whether there have been any other EWGs 
which have set a precedent.

I look forward to reviewing the memo.

Thanks,

Ben

Ben, Harry Kingerski shared with me your message to Rick Shapiro relative to 
your need for regulatory assistance on projects located in various 
jurisdictions.  
I have been assisting other ENA people on similar issues and now offer to 
assume responsibility for putting together a matrix of the various rules that 
apply to your projects.  The primary issues that I see are as follows:

 (1) whether new generation projects require a certificate of need or similar 
grant of authority from state authorities, and if so, what is entailed in 
obtaining  such authority ;

 (2) the degree to which, if any, the owners of such projects fall within the 
regulatory jurisdiction of state PUCs (as a public utility or otherwise);

 (3) whether there are state siting requirements (and if so, what are they); 
and 

 (4) an assessment of local zoning requirements.

Obviously, there may also be environmental permitting issues as well - is 
that something you are looking for a state-by-state assessment of as well?

I will send to you a memo that was prepared recently for ENA/Pulp & Paper 
relative to a small generation project in Wisconsin.  The purpose of sending 
you the memo is to determine whether the issues analyzed in that context are 
similar to those you are confronting.  I will need more information about the 
projects to get started.  Please call me when you have a chance to discuss 
this matter.  -Bob (3-3180)
