I had a conference call with Michael Guerriero, Juli?n Poole and Andrea Calo 
regarding the information Enron must submit to ACEERA, the power marketers 
association, next Monday morning, to be included in ACEERA's presentation to 
the Secretariat of Energy.
I will make the first draft of the information we will submit next Monday 
morning, that will cover points 9 to 13 below. My draft must be ready 
tomorrow afternoon.
In order to do it, I will apreciate if you could give material to support the 
following main guidelines (in blue) we would follow.
The material could include papers, letters, documents, and international 
examples I could mention, explaining the benefits of following these criteria 
and how should they be implemented.

9. Criteria for the treatment of Marketers' activities.
They are not a public service
Marketers should daily declare their offered prices (as gencos) for their 
forcasted firm supply to be included in the determination of daily dispatch 
and spot prices. This could reduce the supply concentration.
Warranties required to Marketers. All players in the spot market should 
present similar warranties.
Right to interrupt the service for customer default. How can this be 
implemented?
It should be allowed to act as both marketers or brokers.

10. Criteria for the treatment of large users.
All gencos, marketers, distcos and large users must be authorized to be both 
the buyer and seller in the foward contracts market

11. Criteria for the treatment of supply contracts.

12.  Criteria for transferring to end users market prices.
Possibility to include in the pass through the cost of hedging products. Did 
we get this approved anywhere in USA? Where? How is the pass through done 
(procedure)?
Full unbundling is better than pass through, since prices can be determined 
by supply and demand

13.  Criteria for  functioning of the forward market.
All gencos, marketers, distcos and large users must be authorized to be both 
the buyer and seller in the foward contracts market
Elimination of minimum terms and volumes in this market
Free prices and conditions
Forward market contracts do not require former aproval to be executed. 
Only LDC's contracts to be included in the pass through to rates should be 
subject to regulation.

And any other point you consider relevant to make related to these subjects

I will appreciate any information you could give me as soon as possible.
Regards
GC

Colleagues:

After a discussion with Michael and Julian, they see that it is more 
effective to concentrate our efforts on providing comments (and language if 
possible) to the points highlighted in Red below.  They also agreed in 
interpreting the term "Criteria" as "Is the suggested language in the 
reglemento is in favour of our generation and marketing activity? If not what 
is the suggested alternative".  

He shall contact you shortly to confirm this message and agree on the time 
framework which is likely be this coming Monday.

Please let me know if you have any question taking into consideration that I 
can provide examples from CA systems.
