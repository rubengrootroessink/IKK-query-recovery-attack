Just for your information

Again, one issue which is key for Enron.  In my view, It took too much time=
=20
for us to put a stick on the ground. Back in April, Regulatory Affairs=20
identified all the riks, opportunities and key success factors one should=
=20
face in the rationing.  Now distributors have [finally] agreed that Annex V=
=20
is key. The Government proposal to kill Annex V is obscene.=20

Debora

Good points.

Economic Equilibrium. You are right. We can claim it. However, it may be=20
virtually impossible to claim the opportunity cost of a foregone long=20
position. I would not take this risk.

Your statement that ANEEL has no power to change Annex V makes me feel more=
=20
confortable. It makes me believe that the right way of approaching the issu=
e=20
is to prepare a position paper on Monday and to deliver/explain it directly=
=20
to Minister Pedro Parente. No need to spend time on consensus building on=
=20
issues which are "zero sum game" by nature (two years of COEX have taught m=
e=20
this lesson).  Let's preempt the issue by being  faster and smarter.=20

Maurer,

This is a very important issue. Although in case of loss to Elektro, we wou=
ld=20
always be eligible to claim for the reestablishment of the economic-financi=
al=20
balancing of the concession agreements, we would be, with no doubt, in a=20
better position in case we can maintain the Annex V.

Regarding the ANNEL sympathy towards generator=01,s pressure, I don't belie=
ve=20
ANEEL has the authority to interfere in a duly executed agreement, as it is=
 a=20
perfect legal act ("ato jur?dico perfeito"). Only the Union is competent to=
=20
intervene in such acts, based on the public interest and the social well=20
being.

I will work hard on the analysis of the matter and come back with further=
=20
comments.

Thanks,
D,bora

Subject: Generators want to kill Annex V

The rumor mill says that generators want to revoke Annex V. No surprise. Th=
e=20
bad news is that it seems that Aneel likes the idea.

This may represent a US$ 60 million loss to Elektro, only in 2001.=20

Distribution companies are [aparently] against this measure. However, D/Cs =
is=20
short position will [likely] applaud the idea (to avoid costly exposures in=
=20
the MAE)

An Abradee group was created to think about the issue. Joao and Fred will=
=20
participate tomorrow.

A few supporting arguments.

1) Contract sanctity. Why changing the rules in the middle of the game if=
=20
Annex V was designed specifically to deal with rationing conditions?=20

2) More subtle argument. The risk of  being exposed is the only economic=20
incentive  for a D/C to reduce its load. Otherwise, we will have a classica=
l=20
"free ride" problem: D/Cs will not put any effort to reduce their=20
loads/revenues and will advocate for an ex-post adjustment on ICs based on=
=20
verified load reduction. We can build a case that in the absence of this=20
exposure, D/Cs will have no incentives to work hand in hand with their=20
clients to foster load reduction and the whole program will fail.

Debora is working on the legal aspects of Annex V, taking into account the=
=20
new MP. Sergio has talked to a few lawyers to get their views/written=20
opinions.

What about writing a letter to Pedro Parente as Enron, exploring those issu=
es=20
and explaining why Annex V is so important to the success of the whole=20
program? (the free ride issue)
