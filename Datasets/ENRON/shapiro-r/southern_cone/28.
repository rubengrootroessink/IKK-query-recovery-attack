I think there is only one point of view. We should defend Annex V. We want =

Luiz Travesso (AES) was quite aggressive last Saturday in trying to convinc=

My view was to defend contract sanctity, which for him is a [minor] detail.=
=20
He screamed loudly and swore to God he was not going to pay if Tiete gets=

killing the messenger.

Demostenes (AES) defended the idea that ANNEX V is a risk sharing mechanism=
=20
between Gs and Ds and because of this those should sit down again and agree=
=20
on a new risk allocation mechanism. This is wrong.  I helped design Annex V=

The only reason why ANNEX V is there is to mitigate the isk for generators,=
=20
not distributors. (statistically, a generator will not able to deliver its=
=20

The argument that rules are being changed is weak. No rules are being=20
