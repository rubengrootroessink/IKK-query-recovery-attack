Subject:	Shell Mediation

Connie - looks like Jim Hughes is going to Enron's senior management rep for resolving the dispute we have with Shell.

The mediation is scheduled for Nov 5 through 7.  Location not yet confirmed.  Please let me know if Jim is available on those dates.

We also need 4 hours of Jim's time on two seperate days, preferrably days that are adjacent to each other.  Is he available on October 30 and 31 - the morning of each day would be best.  This time will be used for Preperatory Work for the Shell Mediation.  Please confirm.

Jose - we could use your help on this one, Laine - you are in the starting lineup.  Steve - you too. 

I am going to recruit Rick Lammers.

Yvette - please confirm and get the dates on my calendar.

Pete
