I have been called by Simon Rosenberg at the NDN.  He said that things are 
deteriorating for many of his members who want to take a balanced approach on 
the crisis.  He said their internal polling have energy issues and their 
impact on the environment on thee top of the priority list in the New Dem 
districts.  Simon reported the surge in interest in energy is shocking.  He 
said Lieberman may have come out early in support of price caps and 
investigations...but others may follow.  

Chuck Alston with the DLC called the same day to tell me that they are 
hearing similar concerns from several New Democrats and Chuck said they may 
be pushed into supporting cost-of-service-based rate making.  He and Will 
Marshall REALLY do not want to do this. I told him that we would oppose this 
and that we wanted to work with them to find other solutions.

Note that the NDN is hosting an energy event in late June where we will be 
listed as co-host as an executive committee member.  I told Megan that making 
it a fundraiser was not a good idea, instead make it a membership recruitment 
event.

NDN is planning an energy industry breakfast for June 21st at the AGA.  We
have several Members of Congress on board and are pushing to get at least
one Senator.  There has been some debate on how to do this event.  We're
wavering between couching it as a NDN members only event (hence making it a
fundraiser) or we can open it to all energy companies (hence making it a
prospecting event.)  I thought I would run this by you and get your thoughts
on it.  Any feedback you can give would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!
