The IRS issued an update to their synfuels ruling.  It is attached.  They 
change the size of the coal from no larger than 1/8 inch to no larger than 
3/8 inch.  It also lists the type of mixture and heating that is required and 
how the feedstock is to be subjected to elevated temperature and pressure.
