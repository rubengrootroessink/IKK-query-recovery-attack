Ginger --

Linda thought she had sent this DRAFT letter  (from Ken Lay to Clay Johnson 
re: Glenn McCullough's interest in serving as the Chairman of the TVA) to 
Rick -- but I could not locate it under "SENT" documents in her Lotus Notes 
file.

(Hope you had a good weekend.  This was really the first "summer" weekend 
we've had and it was glorious.  I suspect you are already familiar with 
"summer" in Houston!)
