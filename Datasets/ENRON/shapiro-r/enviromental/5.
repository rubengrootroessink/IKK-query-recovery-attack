Re: Voluntary Approaches to Climate Change - Action in Congress & the=20
Administration

Date:   April 30, 2001

In the current debate over how the U.S. should approach domestic and=20
international climate change issues, focus has increased lately on explorin=
g=20
=01&voluntary=018 approaches to reduce greenhouse gases.  President Bush=01=
,s=20
statements that the U.S. would not impose mandatory CO2 reductions on power=
=20
plants as part of a multipollutant bill and his position that the U.S. shou=
ld=20
not move forward with work on the Kyoto Protocol (which contains actual=20
commitments on emission reductions) have driven the discussion about=20
voluntary programs and whether such programs can achieve significant result=
s.

Two articles (attached) appeared in the Washington Post over the weekend. =
=20
The first, reported on an interview with Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle=
=20
(D-S.D.) where he said that he and other Democrats would be open to new=20
approaches to address climate change, including voluntary compliance with=
=20
greenhouse gas emission reduction goals.  In response to strong criticism b=
y=20
environmentalists, a second article appeared on Sunday that backs away from=

those remarks and re-states his support for =01&binding measures=018 to red=
uce=20

Both the Bush Administration and leaders on Capitol Hill are seeking Enron=
=01,s=20
input on the structure and potential effectiveness of voluntary programs.  =
=20
As the Administration=01,s Climate Change Task Force is preparing its=20
recommendations for a new U.S. proposal, our input is needed in the next fe=
w=20
weeks.
Experience with Voluntary Approaches - Back to the Future?
The U.S. and other developed nations have acknowledged that significantly=
=20
reducing greenhouse gas emissions will be extremely difficult through=20
voluntary measures alone.  It is not yet known whether the Bush=20
Administration will propose a climate change plan that will result in lower=
=20
atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases.  However, it is unlikely th=
at=20
a U.S. proposal that calls for only voluntary measures will carry any=20
credibility in the international debate. =20
Clearly, industry opponents to carbon regulation do not seek a strong=20
program, but as recent weeks suggest, Administration officials have differi=
ng=20
views on objectives and approaches.    Below are some recent examples of wh=
y=20
voluntary plans in the past have not provided the desired results:
1) Under the Framework Convention on Climate Change, signed by former=20
President Bush and subsequently ratified by the U.S. Senate, developed=20
countries voluntarily agreed to return their greenhouse gas emissions to 19=
90=20
levels by the year 2000.  By 1995, industrialized countries acknowledged th=
at=20
they were not on track to meet the voluntary goal, and initiated negotiatio=
ns=20
to adopt binding and quantifiable emissions reduction commitments.  These=
=20
negotiations resulted in the Kyoto Protocol=01,s targets and timetables, wh=
ere=20
industrialized nations committed to reduce their aggregate emissions to abo=
ut=20
5 percent below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012 and the U.S. agreed to a=
=20
reduction of 7 percent below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012.=20

2) On the domestic level, the 1992 Energy Policy Act directed DOE to develo=
p=20
a voluntary reporting program to collect information on activities to reduc=
e=20
greenhouse gas emissions.  The aim of the =01&1605b=018 program is to encou=
rage=20
voluntary emissions reductions.  While some companies participate in the=20
program, it has not yielded significant emissions reductions.  Companies=20
participate mostly to receive positive pubic relations benefits and to gain=
=20
experience with inventories, reporting and verification.  Many hope to be=
=20
rewarded with credits for their voluntary action under a potential mandator=
y=20
program.  To encourage participation, 1605b provides wide flexibility on=20
setting a baseline.  It also allows for dual reporting of emissions=20
reductions, self-certification of reductions and permits the entity to deci=
de=20
the level of reporting it undertakes.

A 1998 GAO study said that EIA and other organizations agreed that many of=

Opportunities for Enron

Through our ongoing advocacy on domestic multipollutant strategies and our=

role as a respected source for information on how to structure market-based=

systems for emissions reductions, Enron is well situated to provide=20
high-level input to the Administration and Congress toward developing=20
credible energy and climate change proposals.  In particular, we have a rea=
l=20
opportunity to promote ideas that benefit Enron businesses - new generation=
,=20
gas, energy efficiency, emissions trading and risk management - while handi=
ng=20
the White House some ways to restore its credibility on climate issues.

Enron=01,s input should continue to focus on mechanisms that will result in=
 real=20
reductions of greenhouse gas emissions, while providing full flexibility fo=
r=20
companies and others to meet clear goals.  We have already indicated to the=
=20
Administration and others in initial discussions that voluntary measures=20
could fit into a comprehensive package, but will likely fall short of=20
environmental and international expectations. =20

The Senate will be conducting several hearings in the coming weeks, and the=
=20
White House=01,s Task Force will continue to meet and prepare its climate c=
hange=20
proposal.  Jeff and I will develop specific recommendations for the White=

groups.  We will also incorporate discussion of these issues in an Enron-wi=

strategy meeting on emissions issues we are planning in May.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.
