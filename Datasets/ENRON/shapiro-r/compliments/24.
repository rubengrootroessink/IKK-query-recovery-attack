Rick:

The California team has been working tirelessly for months on end to protect Enron's business interests and good name under tremendously challenging circumstances.  As a shareholder, I appreciate the team's individual and collective efforts.  Your message is obviously heart-felt, and appropriately recognizes the important work that has been (and continues to be) done.  That kind of recognition is what inspires people to keep on keeping on.  

Lisa
