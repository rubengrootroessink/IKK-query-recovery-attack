Rick:  I don't usually do stuff like this, but I really wanted to send him this after all of the whining we heard this morning ("why doesn't Enron pay for eye surgery", etc).  Please do not share this with anyone else.

First of all, welcome back!  I have always been proud to be part of the "Ken Lay team."  

I felt compelled to write this note to you after listening to the questions you received at this morning's meeting.  I have worked for the FERC and several large energy companies, and, in my opinion, none of these companies treat their employees as well as Enron.   All in all, we have it very good here at Enron.

I agree that we have outstanding leadership talent at Enron.  I report directly to Rick Shapiro, and I have never had a boss that I respect more than Rick.  He embraces the visions and values that you talked about this morning.

Thank you for your loyalty to our company, and to its employees.   

Best regards,

Lisa
