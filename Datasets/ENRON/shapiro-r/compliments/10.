Thanks.
 
By the way, thank you also for the message you sent to the group about yesterday's events.  One person in our group remarked to me that getting that message was like getting a "much needed hug". 
 
Jennifer

Don't worry about it -I'm still exploring what we can do ( before Chris Called)...Don't want to get your hopes up, but we'll see over the next few weeks.I like Chris alot, even more now, knowing he initiated this on his own.

Rick:
 
I understand that Chris Calger called you the other day.  Betweeen you and me, I wanted to let you know that neither my husband nor I was aware that he was going to call you.  I hope it did not put you in an awkward position.
 
Thanks, 
 
Jennifer
