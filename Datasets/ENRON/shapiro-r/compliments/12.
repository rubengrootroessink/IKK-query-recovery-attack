I really appreciate your note.  Beth continues to have concerns with the no=
tion of me getting on an airplane ... a fact that comes out in interesting =
ways during the day.  Thank you for giving us an opportunity to let the dis=
comfort pass or lessen. =20

It's always been hard to determine what is essential vs. nonessential trave=
l.  Our jobs involve personal touch and contact.  We can't stay off of airp=
lanes for very long without compromising some of our effectiveness.  On the=
 positive side, very few of our elected friends outside of California are e=
ven thinking about energy issues.

I've done a good job of clearing the calendar for the next two weeks, but I=
'm already booking trips the first week of October.  Hopefully the world wi=
ll be calm during the interim and we can all get back to some semblance of =
normalcy. =20

Paul

Subject:=09The aftermath of September 11th -- Enron Government Affairs


    The events of September 11th are still very much with us and will conti=
nue to be for some time, perhaps for as long as we live. For those who have=
 not heard me say this regarding air travel,individuals should avail themse=
lves of the travel services the company is offering in the way of guidance =
for those that are traveling and only travel by air for essential matters( =
until further notice). In addition, anyone who is currently  uncomfortable =
with the notion of air travel  need not do so...we will work around this fo=
r as long as the need exists. The company has also provided information on =
the availability of counseling services should anyone have the need- please=
 contact HR or the Benefits Group for further information.
     A final couple of notes: If there is a silver lining in the events of =
September 11th, it is the kindness, generosity, and humanity it brings out =
in the rest of us...I have seen this play out in untold ways in our "group"=
,both in London and at home,  over the last nine days , including( to a per=
son) the absence of any hint of bias being shown towards the individual in =
our group who is an "Arab American" and a Muslim, Amr Ibrahim. My high rega=
rd and respect for the Government Affairs group and for each individual  ha=
s been validated many times over  during the past nine days. Thank you very=
 much.--- Rick Shapiro
