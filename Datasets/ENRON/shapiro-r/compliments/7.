I'm not sure I said it at all, but clearly did'nt say it often enough...each of you and many others around you do a remarkable job under difficult and demanding circumstances. With each trip to Brazil, I gain more respect for each of you and the personal and professional sacrifices you make...more than ever should have to be demanded. Your respective commitments to Enron are quite amazing. The best part about Brazil has been getting to know each of you and thinking of each of you, not only as professional colleagues, but also as friends.
    With your continuing efforts, I am quite confident that the company will ultimately be far better off because  of your presence and  respective efforts. While my contributions over the the last two years to Enron South America are few and pale in comparison to each of yours, I want to be of assistance where I can- please feel free to call upon me whenever I can be of help. Thanks again for for great work and efforts. See you again soon.
