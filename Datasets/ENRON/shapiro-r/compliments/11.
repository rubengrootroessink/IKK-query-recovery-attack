I wanted to let you know how much your note to all of us meant to me.  I shared it with my husband and his response was "What a mensch!"  That was perfect.  You are that.  I was horrified to hear from Ginger today that your wife was also away from home.  I can't imagine that -- I would have been terrorized. It's good to hear she may be getting home today.  I hope you're doing OK.  We look forward to your safe return.
