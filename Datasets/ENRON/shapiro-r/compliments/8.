Hi Rick,

Thanks for your kind note.  I know I really appreciated it, and I'm sure ev=
eryone else does, too.

I just talked with Ginger and she mentioned that Amy is travelling this wee=
k, too, and won't be able to get home from Pittsburgh until Friday.  I'm su=
re it must be hard for both of you to be away from the boys at this time.  =
Eric is planning to call your house to see if there's anything we can do to=
 help while you're away.  Our kids would love to have Ben and Jonathan over=
 to play any time.  Please encourage your mother-in-law and your au pair to=
 let us know if there's anything we can do to help.

Take care,

Sue

 to extend your stays as necessary until you are comfortable returning home=
