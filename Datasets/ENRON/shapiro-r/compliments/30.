A follow-on to Janel's comments: I wanted to comment a bit on the " Califor=
nia campaign", our group's(internal and external) individual and collective=
 efforts, and the work that continues: While I may be properly, and not sur=
prisingly, characterized as "non-practicing"(in a formal religious sense), =
I do believe quite firmly that what we do in life( and how we do it) echoes=
 through eternity...it is the effort and the quality of the effort in all t=
hat we do in our lives that both matters and echoes...While we engage in wo=
rk that cannot be equated with the work of people, past and present, such a=
s Mother Teresa, the work we do is good, very good in fact, and makes a sig=
nificant difference to the 18,000 Enron employees and their families...Each=
 of you, in the context of the broad "campaign" to communicate the rightnes=
s of our perspective and to protect the good name of the company and indivi=
duals within the company, has put forth a great effort that has been perfor=
med with excellence and that has made a significant and positive difference=
....and that has succeeded in many respects thus far....I understand the ef=
fort continues, but each of you should feel very proud now.... about what w=
e have done and how we have done it. Thanks very much.
