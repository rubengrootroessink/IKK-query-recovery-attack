I am pleased to announce that effective July 1st the following individuals =
have been promoted from Director to Senior Director. =20

Dan Allegretti - Dan has been a leader on both retail and wholesale electri=
city issues in New England for the past several years with Enron, resulting=
 in Dan currently serving as Chair of the New England Power Pool Participan=
ts Committee.  Dan, more importantly, has been very active, both in the pas=
t and during the course of this year, in ensuring that transactional opport=
unities in the New England region are fully exploited by both Enron Wholesa=
le Services and Enron Energy Services.  Dan's participation in the United I=
lluminating deal has been mentioned many times, but Dan has also played a c=
ritical role in working with Enron Energy Services this year in helping to =
develop a national business plan for creating value through the delivery of=
 retail services in partnership with municipal and privately owned utilitie=
s.

Robert Hemstock - Rob's participation in the development of Alberta's compe=
titive electricity market and the ensuing PPA project, that has produced co=
nsiderable value for Enron and Enron Canada has been quite notable.  Rob ha=
s been a leader, not only with policy makers, but also with his commercial =
counterparts in ensuring that the PPA transaction was brought to fruition l=
ast year.  Rob has also played a critical role in preserving the value embe=
dded in that deal throughout the course of this year.  Rob's knowledge of b=
oth wholesale and retail issues in both the natural gas and electricity ind=
ustries in Western Canada is unparalleled. =20

Sue Mara - Sue is a warrior.  Sue has fought endlessly and courageously dur=
ing her years with Enron in trying to ensure, against all odds, that retail=
 and wholesale electricity markets work as effectively as possible in Calif=
ornia while also protecting Enron's interests in that very challenging stat=
e.  Sue is a passionate believer in the efficacy of markets, and fights tir=
elessly for both the issues as well as the well-being of the company in Cal=
ifornia.

Please join me in congratulating each of these individuals on their signifi=
cant accomplishments.
