to get home- Please  feel free to utilize all reasonable and safe ways to r=
eturn home...you will be reimbursed for such efforts. Please also feel free=
 to extend your stays as necessary until you are comfortable returning home=
. There isn't much more to say about yesterday's events that hasn't already=
