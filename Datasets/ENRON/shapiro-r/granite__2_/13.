Paul --  please see the following comments on the schedule.
	  1.  October 8 - change entry to "draft expert testimony"
	  2.  add new entry -- Oct. 16 - "draft FERC filing"
	  3.  FERC has a public meeting scheduled for October 11 (usually
meetings are Wednesday, but this month it is                  Thursday).
Therefore we need to move the prefiling meeting with FERC staff to Friday,
October 11.

Subject: Regulatory timeline


Attached is a draft regulatory timeline for the transaction--assuming a
September 10 rollout.   Note that the timeline does not include dates
for the Washington UTC or the SEC.   Joanne, please add your thoughts to
the document and send comments back to me. 

NNG agreed to the proposed "all hands" meetings in Portland.  Joanne and
Adam, please put these dates on your calendars.  

In our meeting with NW today, they made clear that they have not yet
hired local counsel.  Apparently their counsel of choice has a potential
conflict.  They are willing to seek a waiver, but that raises
confidentiality issues.  

Re:  FERC counsel, we provided two names for their consideration and
emphasized the importance of getting counsel on board quickly.  We made
the same point re:  a market power consultant.  They are willing to
retain Hieronymous.  I'll forward the retainer letter to Mark Dodson
this evening.  

Re:  the rollout plan. We have NNG's agreement on the basics of the
rollout plan, but NNG wanted to play with it a little.  They will send
back a final copy of the document.  I'll circulate it once I receive the
document.
