My proposed response:  

"Jason:

From Enron and Dynegy's standpoint, there is a binding contract between NWN and Enron for the sale of PGE.  There is only one suitor.  Dynegy remains committed to the transaction.  At this juncture, Dynegy is analyzing Oregon law to determine how it applies to them ... so it's premature to discuss 511.  

To use your analogy--"there's no reason to be envious, you picked the best the bride."

We hope that everyone can stay focused on the NWN transaction--at this point it is the only proposal for the acquisition of PGE pending before the OPUC.  

Hope you are well.  Give me a call if you have any questions.
