Wade:

Two of the issues that I was looking forward to discuss with you in Houston 
were as follows:
The opinion of the GA - Washington Team of the outstanding Government Affairs 
issues that need to be taken care of in the coming period, and
How can Houston G&Reg. Affairs help you during Ken Ley expected visit to 
India.
 
Washington Team informed me that  they shall continue providing their support 
on as-needed basis.  Their understanding is that these needs  will be 
determined by you directly, as Jane was not directly involved in determining 
these needs.   They shall accommodate any changes in the personnel structure, 
if it happens, and will work accordingly.  In the same context, their 
evaluation at this time is that GoI is not ready to take a decision soon on 
DPC issue.  Furthermore, they even doubt any discussion that purports that 
GoI is deliberately ignoring the issues so that to create a form-of-a-crisis, 
then step forward to solve it and seek a quid-pro-quo from the US Gov.; 
Coalition governments are rarely that organized.  It follows, they continue, 
Dr. Ley's visit is unlikely to be effective, and very possibly, we are 
spending our "golden bullet" a bit too early.  

In reference to Ken Ley visit, I was trying to consolidate your team by 
asking Rick Shapiro to be in the same time in India.  The objectives are: a)  
introduce the entire Team in India (government, and regulatory, also 
commercial, and legal) to him so that he can rally all support your needs in 
a cost-effective, and continuous,  manner from Houston at this important 
juncture, and b) ensure that all resources from Washington are properly 
mobilized during this visit.   Please,  let me know what you think of this 
idea.

Finally, I am still working on EBS needs and shall keep you posted shortly.
