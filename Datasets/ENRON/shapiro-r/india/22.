	USG has now met after the PM Visit and its strategy is for OPIC to go to Delhi the week after next (Dec 4-5) and meet with GOI to underscore the fact that a private equity sale will not take care of the project and that the GOI has only several weeks to address and dispose of the issue before the Dabhol problem becomes the subject of formal bilateral negotiations in which OPIC moves across the table.  Accordingly OPIC is expecting that out of next week's meetings will come a decision to file a claim, which they will not contest.
	I am meeting with OPIC management fri AM to discuss specific message so any additional points I would appreciate before then.

	Also, FYI,   OPIC is going to India from Turkey where they are negotiating a resolution to the foreign exchange issue on Trakya.  OPIC senior management is spending the bulk of its time on Enron issues, including Electrobolt and Cuiaba.
