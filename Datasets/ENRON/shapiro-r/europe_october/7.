The "what" has already taken some shape during the strategic review element of the restructuring process. I would expect the outcomes of the prioritisation exercise to be:

a regularly updated progress document for consumption by John and Michael;
regular prioritisation meetings with our key clients (Richard, Eric, Gregor, Paul Mead et al) to identify the trade offs and direct resource allocation

I'm away next week following my house move, but will be keeping in regular contact with the office at the very least to manage the transition for those that will not be staying with the team.  I will then be meeting the remaining team the following week to kick start the prioritisation process.

I have already discussed this with Jan bilaterally.

Paul

What ( and when) are your plans for the prioritization exercise you mentioned in the e-mail to Jan?

Jan,

Sounds like a great idea!  At the moment, the focus has clearly had to be on managing the restructuring process.  However, clearly, going forward we will need to sit down as a group and define our priorities going forward.  I'm away next week, but will be setting something up for the following week to begin this process.  I'm also happy to meet bilaterally and will arrange this also.

Paul

Paul,

Since the broadband venture of Enron is about to come to an end, I would like to meet up with you and set new priorities for the coming 6 months. As of 1 November, I will be fully available for other business units. Currently, I bill about 33 % of my time on Germany, mostly for the ongoing cartel procedures and some tax related issues.

Since I am some sort of versatile guy with some language capacities, I could take over some responsibilities in following continental markets (Germany
Austria, Switzerland, BeNeLux, or  France). I also could assist Peter Styles in some Brussels related matters, since after 5 years of professional activity there, I have a good apprehension of how the European Institution system works.

I am in principle open for any suggestion, as long as it gives me a clearly defined area of responsibility and a good learning experience.  The current downsize of our group should leave some vacant areas to pick up. I would also expect some priority setting. Let me know when it is convenient for you to meet. 

Thanks

Jan

A rather interesting article about the fate of EBS appears in today's BMR.  Please open the attachment.
