Just to keep you in the loop. I have myself spoken to Brendan a couple of times since he left, and have seen him once. 
In his synopsis of areas of activity for DG TREN, "new gas legislation" means Member State implementing legislation. "Gas market regulatory issues" could include a yet to be drafted EU cross border gas transmission/ trading regulation.
Paul H is meeting him and Klaus Geil in Brussels on Monday to talk prinipally about German gas.
