Thanks for the thoughts. Sharing frustrations certainly makes me feel better, even if it isn't changing the course of events and your assistance going forward once we're over the immediate problems will be invaluable.

Cheers

Paul

Good talking to you today...I didn't intend to send your way my own personal frustrations with the budget process on both sides of the ocean...you're doing a great job dealing with these issues and have the right attitude about moving on with what you have available in the way of resources...I hope I can be of some small assistance in figuring how we continue to have an impact with less. As to my next visit, I've tentatively slotted the week of December 10th. Talk to you soon. Cheers.
