FYI - we did not intervene in the GFU because of commercial sensitivities about damaging our relationships with them.  Peter has painted this to me - and I therefore assume others - as an area where Doug has let the ball drop.  This is highly misleading since Doug was very much on top of the issues, but resisted action because of the commercial drivers.

I am just about to leave for Dulles airport, Steve, but let me give you a few headline notes, further to our discussion on Wednesday afternoon.

VPP capacity auctions France
What they are: Virtual gencap. auctioned from 9/01 by EdF onward to market entrants, one product mimicking baseload, another peaking capacity; 6000 MW for five years extendable (= c. 10% of French peak demand or c. 7% of capacity used in France inc. for exports.)
How we got them: I wrote submission with Brattle and Linklaters at interim stage of EC investigation into EdF's takeover of EnBW in Germany; presented idea at Hearing; persuaded E.On and RWE to support the remedy (though initially they were sceptical/ didn't understand.)

Break-up of GFU and intro. of TPA regime to Norwegian North Sea
What this means: No more cartellised selling of Norwegian gas at continental terminals; access for new entrants to supplies either at those terminals or at platforms when TPA regime sorted out with Norwegian gov.
How we got this: EC investigation into GFU with co-op of EFTA Surveillance Authority; cartel is suspended but further remedies against participants still pending; we have not intervened pro-actively; still a chance to do so or use threat of doing so as commercial lever; also a great opportunity to tell the Norwegian gov. how to organise their TPA regime (also no intervention so far).

Investigation of German long distance gas transmission TPA terms
What's happening: Pressure by EC on Ruhrgas, Thyssengas and BEB to yield better terms. Enquiry stemming from original '94 Marathon complaint (also root of GFU investigation); revived this year.
What have we done: Very little (though EC aware of parallel EFET effort under German NTPA discussions), except answer questionnaires sent earlier this year about EU-wide terms of access and a more recent questionnaire (at least under EFET umbrella) about concessions offered by Thyssengas. Now stepping up effort using external counsel in Brussels and engaging German country manager.
