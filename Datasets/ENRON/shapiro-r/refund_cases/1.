Great.  Per yesterday's conference call, we (DC) talked to Bob today about our "media" outreach early next week.  Pat Shortridge is coordinating with Bob.

Summary - Final day of PNW hearings: 

- Very limited cross-examination of our witnesses (only one worth mentioning is PacifiCorp on definition of spot market)

- Extensive argument over admissibility of evidence concerning pre-12/25/00 events - ALJ ultimately allowed most of our evidence into the record but excluded the claimants' attempt to put in Kahn/Joskow study regarding  summer "00 CAISO prices.  

- TGF lawyers very effectively cross-examined staff witness who advocates defining spot market as including transactions of up to 1 year.


Briefs are due on 9/14 along with proposed findings of fact and rulings of law.  If you have any other questions, I'll be back in Houston tomorrow around noon.
