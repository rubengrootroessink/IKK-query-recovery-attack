FERC and California ISO Move Closer to Decision on Refund Issue=20

[News item from Reuters] U.S. regulators met with California state energy o=
fficials on Sept. 24 as part of ongoing mediation efforts to determine pote=
ntial refunds in the Western power market, a spokeswoman for the Federal En=
ergy Regulatory Commission (FERC) said. Separately, a House of Representati=
ves panel signaled a possible probe into alleged price manipulation by two =
government-controlled California bodies that buy power for the state, accor=
ding to a memo obtained by Reuters. FERC will facilitate meetings with the =
California Independent System Operator (ISO), the California Department of =
Water Resources-the state's main power buyer-seven private energy firms, an=
d the state's investor-owned utilities. FERC is concerned that "reliability=
 is being compromised" on the California power grid, Andrea Wolfman, a lawy=
er in FERC's enforcement office, wrote in a letter dated Sept. 17 obtained =
by Reuters.=20

Analysis: In one of the lingering issues of the California energy crisis th=
at has yet to be resolved, FERC, California officials and representatives f=
rom out-of-state power generators seem only incrementally closer to reachin=
g a consensus on the refund issue, which has been under debate for most of =
this year. Two months ago, with California and power generators already loc=
ked in a stalemate over the state's demand for $8.9 billion in wholesale el=
ectricity refunds, FERC Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner halted negot=
iations on July 9 and declared that he would draft a refund plan. At that t=
ime, Judge Wagner made it clear that, while he had not calculated the amoun=
t, refunds would be returned to California and that the vast majority of th=
e methodology presented by the California delegation would be adopted in hi=
s recommendation. Nevertheless, the issue still remains unresolved and now =
faces a new wrinkle: alleged market manipulation on the part of the Califor=
nia ISO and Department of Water Resources, the two state agencies with the =
biggest hand in wholesale transactions in California.=20

It is also important to note at the onset that Judge Wagner disclosed on Ju=
ly 9 that power generators had offered a settlement of $716 million, which =
California officials flatly refused. Of that amount, reportedly $510 millio=
n was offered by the five biggest generators-Duke, Dynegy, Mirant, Reliant,=
 and Williams. California's rejection of the offer signaled the end of the =
negotiations. In any case, the general message from Judge Wagner was one of=
 support for the generators and a belief that any possible refunds would fa=
ll closer to a $1-billion level rather than $9 billion. Nevertheless, now t=
hat Judge Wagner has made his recommendations to FERC, he has apparently st=
epped out of these negotiations.=20

In addition to the California ISO and the three California IOUs (Pacific Ga=
s & Electric Co., Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric),=
 the seven out-of-state energy companies that are participating in the nego=
tiations on refunds are: Calpine (NYSE: CPN), Duke Energy (DUK), Dynegy (DY=
N), Enron (ENE), Reliant (REI), Mirant (MIR), and Williams (WMB). All of th=
ese companies are subject to potential refunds and as a result have seen th=
eir stocks fluctuate on the basis of positive or negative projections. In a=
 nutshell, negotiations among the various parties stalled due to quantitati=
ve dispute over the amount of money that is owed to California. Gov. Gray D=
avis won't budge regarding his claim that generators owe the state nearly $=
9 billion. Most of the generators have consented to paying some amount of r=
efund, but claim that the figure should be no more than $1 billion as a who=
le, adding that any amount above this figure would be unjustified. The wide=
 range between the two amounts is what caused the negotiations to hit a bri=
ck wall and caused Judge Wagner to assume responsibility for a final recomm=
endation to FERC. The stakes in this decision are huge, as Judge Wagner's r=
efund plan (and FERC's subsequent ruling based on its own conclusions) will=
 undoubtedly set a precedent for how wholesale power is bought and sold in =
U.S. markets that are subsequently deregulated.=20

The other point of contention for the out-of-state generators is that the C=
alifornia ISO has reportedly not yet provided any detailed breakdown of dat=
a related to energy consumption by the California IOUs. With what they deem=
 as insufficient data in hand, the generating companies are reticent to mak=
e any further refunds related to what they may or may not owe the state. Al=
so at issue is whether or not previous refund demands made by the state of =
California included transactions that were manually completed or transactio=
ns that were in the process of being filled, the omissions of which could h=
ave artificially inflated the actual refund amount. Further, the generators=
 maintain that their prices only reflected market conditions and that they =
are still owed billions from the state of California.=20

In fairness, the actual dollar amount that the state of California may have=
 been overcharged remains ambiguous because, up to this point, power genera=
tors have also refused to provide data showing their actual cost of produci=
ng power, as this represents competitive information. Rather, all of the pa=
rties involved in the negotiations have made presentations to Judge Wagner,=
 and naturally have made the best case to support their various positions. =
This could all change if the dispute makes its way to a full-blown federal =
trial, as power generators (and state officials, for that matter) might be =
forced to turn over proprietary operational data.=20

Moreover, out-of-state power generators have long been accused of price man=
ipulation by Gov. Davis. Now, however, the new claims are being leveled aga=
inst the California ISO and the Department of Water Resources. As a reminde=
r, the California ISO manages the state's power grid with a mission to ensu=
re that the grid is safe and reliable and that there is a competitive marke=
t for electricity in California. The Department of Water Resources assumed =
the unprecedented role of California's main power purchaser in January 2001=
 when the creditworthy status of the three IOUs became questionable. Specif=
ically (according to the Reuters report), FERC is concerned that "reliabili=
ty is being compromised" on the California power grid by the scheduling and=
 dispatch procedures of the California ISO.=20

In addition, the buying practices of the Department of Water Resources have=
 also been brought into question. The accusation waged against the two agen=
cies is essentially that the Department of Water Resources has spent an exo=
rbitant amount of money for power through long-term contracts that it estab=
lished when electricity prices soared from an average of $30/MWh to over $1=
,000/MWh earlier this year. Prices have now fallen to about $50/MWh due to =
cooler weather trends and reduced demand. FERC's concern, according to the =
memo obtained by Reuters, is that the California ISO is now purchasing surp=
lus power from the Department of Water Resources at high prices to protect =
Gov. Davis from embarrassment related to the high price that the state is s=
till paying for power. These accusations may fall under the investigation o=
f the U.S. House Committee on Government Reform, but at least in this inter=
im period are another sticking point for FERC in the refund negotiations.=
=20

However, from my perspective, these new accusations against the California =
ISO and Department of Water Resources do represent an entirely separate iss=
ue from the refund-from-generators issue. Apart from everything else, the t=
imeframe for which the refunds are being assessed is limited to October 200=
0 through May 2001. This time period may or may not overlap with any allege=
d market manipulation on the part of the two California state agencies. In =
any case, this issue will likely be sorted out through legislative interven=
tion and will probably be kept separate from the refund issue.=20

Although much of this case still remains in contention, some key factors ar=
e fairly undisputed. For instance, FERC has established that it is only see=
king to establish a ruling based on three key areas: refunds of overcharges=
, long-term power contracts, and debts owed to generators by California uti=
lities. Also, as noted, it is clear that the time period for which power ge=
nerators may ultimately have to issue refunds is October 2000 through May 2=
001. Any overcharging that might have occurred outside of this timeframe is=
 beyond the scope of this investigation and would not be included in any re=
funds made by the generators. It is also important to note that, according =
to a report issued by the California Energy Commission, other companies suc=
h as Destec and NRG also participate as non-utility generators in the Calif=
ornia market and are presumably also under investigation. However, both of =
these companies have partnerships with Dynegy, which may have had the more =
active role in determining wholesale prices in the state. In addition, FERC=
 has previously stated that it would be using its new price methodology as =
a basis to determine any potential refunds. The price control methodology, =
issued in June 2001, set an initial price ceiling of $107.9/MWh for wholesa=
le power sales, which is considerably lower than the average price screen p=
ut into place by FERC's original order. Power generators will not be permit=
ted to sell above the mitigated prices in the Western markets.=20

Regarding the refund dispute, Gov. Davis maintains that the $8.9 billion in=
 refunds, a figure that was calculated by the California ISO, is an accurat=
e amount and one that is non-negotiable. Davis acknowledges that the figure=
 includes potential overcharges from government-run operations such as the =
Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) and BC Hydro, which FERC =
does not regulate. If the municipal utilities are not included in the equat=
ion, California officials allege that the power generators listed above col=
lectively owe the state around $6 billion. Yet, when considering other West=
ern states besides California that may also seek refunds from the power gen=
erators, the potential refund claimed by the states could reach as high as =
$15 billion. Records provided to Judge Wagner by California officials indic=
ate that in January 2001, the first month in which the Department of Water =
Resources started to serve as the state's power purchaser, California spent=
 about $332 per megawatt-hour for power on the wholesale spot market.=20

Typically, the contracts already signed by the governor are in place for 10=
 years and were based on higher-than-cost-to-service rates. Some reports ha=
ve indicated that the long-term contracts make the state liable for $43 bil=
lion in power payments over the next decade. At the time the contracts were=
 signed, Davis felt pressure to ensure that California had a reliable suppl=
y of power, but he reportedly has been criticized for locking the state int=
o expensive, long-term agreements and is eager to renegotiate them. While D=
avis is flexible on the various forms that the refunds could take, he has s=
aid, "they have to net out close to $8.9 billion." However, some of the pow=
er generators that established contracts with the state say re-negotiation =
is not possible as they have already locked themselves into deals with natu=
ral-gas suppliers.=20
