Hello! Rick,
 
Today Dr. Jaime Alatorre told me about an Energy Convention in Mexico, where Enron is going to be a Gold sponsor. After this I spoke by telephone with Carlos Camacho who is Director of CRG, the company that is organizing this event.
 
Attached below please find the contract for the sponsorship. The contract is in Spanish, if you like I could get it translated. Carlos has told me that the contract should be signed in Spanish. You will sign two contracts one for you and the other for CRG Consultores.
 
In this contract the information that is missing from Enron is:
 
- Principal address, where they can send notifications
- The name of the person, who will sign this contract  
- Legal representative, in their case, Jose Diego Palafox, who is their legal representative, is going to sign the contract on behalf of CRG Consultores.
- Our legal name (Enron Corp or just Enron ?)
 
Carlos is preparing a file for you with the sponsorship contract, brochures and information related to the event, he will send this information to you. 
 
Regards,
 
Kikumi
