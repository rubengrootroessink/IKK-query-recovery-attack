Rick,

Fernando Alonso is the person from the Ministry of Energy that visited with 
us in Houston and whom we saw in his office in Mexico City.  Fernando as you 
know has been very supportive of all our initiatives and has been an ally 
since he took charge of his office.

He has referred Carlos Lara to me.  He asks that if possible we get him a job 
interview at Enron.  From what I can see, Carlos is a highly qualified 
professional.  Fernando strictly asked for an interview as a personal favor 
from me and in no way has been even close to making an improper request.

Please take a look a t his resum, and  tell me how you want to go on this one.

Best,

Ricardo
