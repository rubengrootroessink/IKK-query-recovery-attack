I'm leaving at 1 o'clock- I don't know if that works or not.

Rick --

I am working with Chris, Mark Taylor and others to pull together the agenda 
and materials for Newsome's visit to Enron on March 6th.  Do you want to host 
Newsome?  Mark Taylor has offered to be the host if you're not available.

Let me know.

Lisa
