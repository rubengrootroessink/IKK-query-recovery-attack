One additional point I should have mentioned on last e-mail...While it was 
good to spend this visit exclusively in the office, I want to find additional 
ways to contribute to the group during my future stays in the London office. 
If there are meetings outside the office, with regulators or others, where I 
could be of value, please let me know. I will try to give as much advance 
notice as possible of future stays in Europe. I'm feeling my way through this 
new role  and will be looking to the four of you for guidance, both as to 
where I can contribute and where I can't. Thanks.
