I think part of the issue is how the allocations are classified within the 
Europe analysis spreadsheet.  Asset Ops EHS and Reg Tech Analysis are 
classified as Asset Management, which doesn't seem to be an issue.  However, 
Chief Environmental Officer is classified by Europe as Public Relations, and 
Environment and Environmental Policy and Compliance are classified as Gov't 
Affairs.  We need to address whether these need to be consolidated as a 
separate category of EHS to include all of these cost center allocations.

This is the first time I've seen this spreadsheet, but I'm happy to work with 
Stephen to work out how to better reflect the categorization - this year if 
possible, and definately for next year.  This may be more at a policy level, 
however, so we may need further involvement of the budget owners.

Is this a 2001 question?  If so it seems to me we shouldn't bother with it.  
If this is a 2002 question, then let;s discuss

I frankly don't see Enron Europe getting $12,000 per month value from 
"Environment" nor "Environmental policy and compliance". I have raised with 
the Washington office why someone there is apparently following European 
environmental legislation and policy, when such things can only directly 
affect Enron Europe's business. I see that PR get hit with more than twice 
this amount to pay for our "Chief Environmental Officer". By copy I'm asking 
RIck Shapiro's view; we could obviously take the question up direct with 
Steve Kean.

Doug may wish to comment on the international project finance allocation, 
also from Washington.

We need to schedule a review with you of the May indicative expenditure 
report. Would late pm on 29th be convenient?

Subject: Corporate Allocations April 2001

All, please review the below Corporate allocations for April.  Total 
allocations for the month are below plan by $1.1m.  Congratulations to HR who 
managed to get a net credit from Corp of $165k.  If you have any questions 
please get back to your management accountant or myself.



regards,
