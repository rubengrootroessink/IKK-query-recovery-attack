Rick - 

Attached is the January 2001 variance report for your review and files.  The 
individual cost centers have some coding issues which need to be resolved but 
overall your group is under budget $828,597 for the month.  There are some 
coding issues within your cost center that we should discuss.

Call with any questions, comments or concerns.

Eric
