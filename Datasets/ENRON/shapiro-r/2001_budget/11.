Rick - 

Attached is the headcount information you requested for the meeting on 
Wednesday (4/11/01) for your review and information.  In addition, I have 
attached excel spreadsheets for each cost center that indicate headcount 
information at the end of 2000, current (2001), anticipated (2002 and 2003).

Please advise if any additional information is needed for Wednesday's meeting.

Eric
