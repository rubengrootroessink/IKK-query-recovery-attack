After talking briefly this morning to Paul D and Doug, I suggest the 
following agenda for our discussion:
 1. Brown/ Sherriff announcement and accompanying "organisation chart"
  - mistakes 
  - other opinions (lack of consultation), optimising efficiency
  - geographic v. business v. functional division of responsibilities
  - business and functional reporting lines
  - further communication with other team members in London
 2. Practical day to day/ week to week matters
  - budget (review planned for early May)
  - existing and potential recruitment 
  - Kean weekly call participation 
  - Sherriff weekly meeting participation
  - London staff meetings
  - Enron Europe weekly report 
  - other intra-group and business communication needs
I have invited Jan to join the call, since the announcement did not call for 
him to report to any of those of us located in London/ Brussels/ Frankfurt.
