Please see attached weekly report from our department that was discussed in 
the meeting, would you like this to be sent to you every Monday before the 
staff meeting?  Also I just talked to Greg McMahon and he is sending you the  
budget spreadsheet shortly he is just doing the finishing touches.

Regards

Merle
