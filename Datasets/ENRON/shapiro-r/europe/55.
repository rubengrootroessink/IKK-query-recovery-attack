Rick: Here's the "draft" Eurelectric report (never saw final, but don't think 
it's materially different.) 

Would be good if whoever is updating Jim Steffes slides from 29/3 could take 
a steer from the issues the report concentrates on, and either endorse/ 
explain them, or rebut/ disentangle them. Also we should bear in mind theme 
of Madrid conferenc is convergence of power and gas markets/ regulation, so 
gas market aspects for Western Area will be of partic. interest. Items to 
de-emphasise in very short slot available may be workings of PX and NOx 
credits trading. 

For potential lessons of relevance to Europe, I think Steve should 
concentrate on dangers in: decoupling of wholesale and retail market, 
attempted upfront guaranteed benefits to smaller consumers, and absence of 
adequate demand side, and generation investment, signals.

Alfredo, Teun, Paul and Paul: As mentioned in staff meeting yesterday, would 
appreciate your one or two slides each of bullet points on lessons for/ 
reassurance of irrelevance to (as the case may be!) your markets by end this 
week. Steve is away, so Rick and I will take a look at pulling this together 
intitially.
