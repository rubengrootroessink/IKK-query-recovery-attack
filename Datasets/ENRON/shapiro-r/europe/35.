Nailia and I are taking care of circulation of relevant material from Energy 
Council of Mon. and Tue. this week. She is also following the EU-Russia 
energy dialogue. 
Would either of you like to flip through the 135 page Competition Report and 
let others in the group know your conclusions (in less than one side A4!!)? 
By the way, you should meet each other, as soon as Brendan makes it to London 
or when Jan next comes to Brussels.

Dear Nailia,

Please find attached the first conclusions of the Energy Council which took
place yesterday. You will note that the Council intends to take a position
on the proposals for the opening of the energy internal market by the
Barcelone Council in spring 2002. We will contact several permanent
representations and the Presidency of the Council to ask about Member
States' positions on this issue.

Attached you will also find the agenda for the EU-Russia summit on 17 May.

I also include the 30th Annual Report on Competition Policy which deals with
the competition policy in general and by sectors, issued today by the
Commission. The report states that competition in the energy markets will be
introduced if the following  conditions are met:
* suppliers are free to compete for customers;
* customers are free to change suppliers;
* an effective, non-discriminatory and cost reflective TPA regime is
introduced and maintained.
The report also deals with the proposal for a new Regulation dealing with
articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty, setting out the competition rules
applicable to restrictive agreements, decisions and concerted practices, and
abuses of dominant positions.

Would you require further information, please do not hesitate to contact us.
Regards,

Amaia
