EUROPEAN ENERGY MARKET LIBERALIZATION: GATHERING PACE

The European Commission has issued two new documents aimed at furthering
liberalization of the European energy market in the second half of the deca=
de.
The Commission has set both quantitative and qualitative objectives for gas=
=20
and
power. France=01,s opposition to the proposals will delay the implementatio=
n of
market opening as envisaged by the Commission. However, in CERA=01,s view t=
he
rejection of the Commission=01,s draft documents is only a temporary slow d=
own in
the process. Liberalization remains a widely shared objective among member
states and is only gathering pace. CERA expects four principal outcomes fro=
m
the ongoing discussions:

* The pace of market opening will accelerate despite French opposition.

* The scope of unbundling will be extended to include separate ownership.

* A unified European approach for grid regulation will emerge.

* Public service obligation will be institutionalized.
