Title: Broadening the Search for Opportunities: Status of Retail Markets in 
the European Union
URL: http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2330


INCREASING IMPORTANCE OF EUROPEAN RETAIL MARKET OPPORTUNITIES FOR NOTRH 
AMERICAN PLAYERS
As the movement toward competition in North American retail markets remains 
uncertain, it is important to consider how opportunities may be evolving in 
Europe.

* European Union Directives will eventually make the electric and gas markets 
more integrated and open, creating a single market comparable to North 
America.

* Significant restructuring of assets and processes is mirroring US 
restructuring activity at the wholesale and retail levels, and in some areas 
moving faster.

* Currently, the only robust competitive retail gas and power market is in 
the United Kingdom, although other countries are technically open with some 
customer switching and still others are soon to follow.
