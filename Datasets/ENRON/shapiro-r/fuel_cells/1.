Below is a list of companies that compose the Fuel Cells Advocate group.  It 
is an ad hoc group that meets on a bi-monthly basis to pursue legislative 
proposals that will further the commercialization of the technology.  The 
$1000 per kilowatt tax credit is only one avenue they are pursuing.  
Membership in the group allows you to participate in the formulating of 
policy and policy papers.  There is NO cost to join, but they occasionally 
ask for contributions for printing materials.  The y are very interested in 
having Enron lend its name and active participation.

Do you want Enron to participate?
