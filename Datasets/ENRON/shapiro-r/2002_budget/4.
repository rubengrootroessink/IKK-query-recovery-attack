Thanks.  This is helpful to us in articulating the role of Govt Affairs here as our approach and initiatives are similar. 

In case you want to include something on Europe, I attach extracts from the presentation that Rob Bradley and I prepared for Ken Lay's speech in Davos last January.  This may be relevant as there's a strong belief in some quarters that continental Europe will contribute significantly to Enron's growth next year, which underestimates the strength of political opposition to liberalisation in a number of countries. So there might be value in sowing the message that there are still major hurdles to overcome in Europe.

If you need more (e.g. a description of some of the initiatives) let me know.

D.

Doug:

As pre the discussion with Rick, please find attached the draft presentation that he intends to use next week.  It is a draft, and at least one iteration is still needed.  Furthermore, the figures related to the retail positions (in the last slides) are being compiled for the last day of the month of August (i.e., today) to make the presentation as up to date as possible.  

Please advise if you intend to add a slide, or two, in reference to Europe.  Finally, please let me know if you have any question.

Rick:

In case that Doug is considering adding  a couple of slides in reference to Europe, then may be an additional two slides for the rest of the assets world wide would be needed.  Please advise if you see it this way too.
