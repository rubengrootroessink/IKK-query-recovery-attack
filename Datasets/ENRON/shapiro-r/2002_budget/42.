We have two.  I have approved RCRs through November.

Edelman -- PR firm -- for about $2400/month.  The current retainer is due on Nov 15. AReM voted last week not to renew this retainer, so Enron's last payment will be for Nov.

AReM Lobbyist -- Norm Plotkin -- for $500/month.  This arrangement also comes due in Nov. AReM voted last week to continue this retainer on a month-to-month basis.
