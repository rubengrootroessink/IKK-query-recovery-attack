Rick, Ginger:

This is the email forwarded to Elizabeth on October 2nd, 2001. The outside services for Risk Analytics are indeed minimal.

Please let me know if you have any question.

Elizabeth:

I do not have access to the spreadsheets.  Kindly consider $50K as a base case, $40K as conservative, and $30K is absolute minimum.  I hope that this is fine with you.  I am more than happy to populate the spreadsheet as soon as I get it.

Many thank
