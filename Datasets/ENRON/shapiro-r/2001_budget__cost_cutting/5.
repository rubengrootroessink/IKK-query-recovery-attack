Rick - below are Harry's proposed budget savings; let me know if you need any 
additional information; I plan to go back and revise the individual budget 
sheets and once we get to an appropriate number I can have the overall budget 
numbers reduced with accounting; I'm not sure if you were planning to give 
money back now or later; let me know; thanks and have a good trip - Eric

Eric - my budget suggestion is this - I had RCR money for $350,000 related to 
Illinois (Com Ed) case.  I suggest cutting this back to $150,000 for now, for 
a savings of $200,000 of budget money.

I didn't have any other specifics.  Thanks.
