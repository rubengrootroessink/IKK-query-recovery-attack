Jim/Rick:

We have revised the draft paper on market objectives and attributes in
response to Jim's comments. This is attached. Much of the material is the
same but there were a few key items that needed clearing up.

The question of how short-term balancing and spot markets should be
organized is so critical (and potentially requiring a significant policy
shift) that we are writing a (much shorter) separate piece on this subject.
Should be ready late this afternoon for discussion on tomorrow's call.

Subject: MY REPLY TO SEABRON





Here are my thoughts (in redline) for Seabron to consider. ?On alot of
this, I don't have a strong opinion. ?Seabron, please beef up the analysis
related to the cost/benefit of the dispatcher running the spot market.

Thanks,

Jim
