Jim/Rick/Steve:

Please see the attached draft. I think I have everything in there we
discussed. Sorry I this has been slower than planned -as I mentioned before
I have been facing a family medical problem.

I will be out of the office for much of the next two days. I can be reached
at (617) 513-5904 (cellphone) or via email. I should be back in the office
full-time from Thursday a.m.

Cheers



Seabron
