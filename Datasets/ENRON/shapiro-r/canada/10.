 FYI - a  joint letter from the IMO and OEB confirming their intention to 
proceed with market readiness by the Fall of 2001.                          
As I indicated earlier to Richard, I have been invited to a meeting with 
several people from the Premier's office on Wednesday  May 2  to discuss the 
announcement ( I have asked Paul Devries to accompany me; representatives 
from Centrica, Toronto Hydro and Enersource/Mississauga Hydro will be there 
as well).                                        I had dinner with Judy 
Hubert (Asst Deputy Minister of Energy whom John met at Ken Lay's speech) on 
Thursday evening: she was aware of the pending meeting between Premier Harris 
and Mr. Lay  and was enquiring about what Mr. Lay wanted to address - I 
indicated that Mr. Lay would want to make the case for opening the market in 
the Fall of 2001(as set out in his speech) and to share with the Premier some 
proposals for moving the matter forward. I also indicated that Mr. Lay would 
be able to provide the Premier with a useful  and honest perspective on the 
events in California and that hopefully , on a going forward basis, the 
Premier would see Mr. Lay as someone he could phone and talk to about those 
issues.  I will sketch out a draft of the proposed speaking points early next 
week.
