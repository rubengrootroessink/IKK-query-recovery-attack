Attached is the draft retainer for Sasha Jacob's new firm.  I think the retainer is a bit rich.  I would suggest cuttimg it to  CAN $10,000-$15,000 per month and shortening the length of the contract to 6 months.

Aleck,

Ginger provided us with Enron's standard retainer earlier this week.  We
have made a few tweaks and I am waiting to hear from Sasha (who is currently
touring Sonoma) so I can bounce a few last minute touches off him.

In any event, we anticipate getting the agreement to you by the close of
business today (provided I hear from our wine-tasting friend) or Tuesday am
at the latest.  The effective start date of the relationship will be
September 4, 2001.

Please call or reply if you need anything else.
