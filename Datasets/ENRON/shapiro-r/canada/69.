Subject:=09Supply Proposal to Premier Harris

Attached is the revised letter and simplified term sheet for the proposed o=
ffer of 500 MW on peak power to Ontario. With respect to the letter, please=
 note as follows: a) It is important for the letter to set out the full con=
text in which the offer is made, because the letter will likely be consider=
ed and reviewed by the Premier's staff and by Ministry of Energy et al staf=
f rather than by the Premier himself. Accordingly, I think that it is advis=
able that the letter make reference to the meetings and the discussions the=
rein and that it be copied to the senior Ministry of Energy people. (Lisa A=
ssaf can provide your assistant with the addresses for Wilson, Purchase and=
 Hubert);  and b) The rationale for making the offer has changed because of=
 the OEB's recent determination that 88 of the 92 distributors are not read=
y, because of systems development and implementation issues,  for a Fall 20=
01 opening but should be ready for an opening in early 2002 (March 1 or Apr=
il 1). Accordingly, the letter presents the proposed arrangement as a way i=
n which the government can overcome the uncertainty regarding the return of=
 Pickering A  and commit to a firm date for market opening in early 2002. =
