This is an ad created for use in the Ontario market and would include the 
logos of the signatory companies (rather than individual signatures).Aleck 
Dadson worked with GPC on its creation.  It is part of the total plan, which 
includes Ken Lay's visit to Toronto April 4 to meet with media and government 
leaders.

Give me your thoughts.

Eric
