FYI - two small articles in the Toronto newspapers  (and WSJ) got us in some hot water with the Minister's office. Seems okay now. 	Hope you are still coming on the 24th.  We should talk before you come about Canadian perspectives on the events of this week.  My own observation is that the events and the aftermath have highlighted how closely tied Canada is to the US and, in particular,  how closely tied Toronto is to New York City.

sasha, attached is a letter that Milnthorp is sending to Wilson today.  It could have been a lot stronger - Rob and Eric Thode (who was on the call) tell me that it was the reporter who got on the interview saying that a date had been set and seeking our reaction; when Rob said he didn't think a date had been set, the  DJ reporter insisted that one had in fact been set.
