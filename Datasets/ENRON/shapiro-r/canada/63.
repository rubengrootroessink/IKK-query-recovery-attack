=09
With respect to point 1 in your  memo, my sense is that the counterparty wo=
uld have to be either OPG or OEFC.  In my view, the concept would not/could=
 not  go forward and be implemented unless it had the support of OPG.  The =
question we should talk through  is how do we best try to get that support =
from OPG. =09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=
=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09With respect to point=
 2, I think we should be careful about being  too encouraged by Wilson's /P=
urchase's comments  to Lay/Lavorato on June 19 that if positive reports are=
 delivered by the IMO and OEB in September, the gov't  will be hard pressed=
 not to move forward.  My concern is that Wilson and Purchase may feel comf=
ortable saying this precisely because they are expecting a negative report =
from the OEB (or at least one that they can interpret as being negative). I=
 agree with you that the likelihood of the IMO delivering a positive report=
 is very good. The likelihood of a positive report from the OEB is far less=
 certain. The key issues  at the OEB/retail level are EBT, LDC access to th=
e data they need from HydroOne, completion of LDC CIS systems,  the gov't's=
 interest in an industry resolution of  customer duplications prior to mark=
et opening in order to avoid mass confusion in the initial period of the ma=
rket, the  state of customer education, and a contingency plan to accommoda=
te those who are not ready.  =09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=
=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09- with respect to EBT, I think=
 the best we can do is get onside quickly with our  EBT hub of choice  and =
work with them on perceived difficulties =09=09with LDCs, etc.  Ellis, Marr=
yott and I are going to make a recommendation to Paul next week on our pref=
erred EBT hub.  =09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=
=09=09=09=09=09-with respect to the info from HydroOne, I  have already rai=
sed this issue with the OEB and the IMO. The OEB and the IMO subsequently m=
et with =09=09HydroOne and the MEA in an effort to resolve this issue.  My =
understanding, until yesterday's discussion with Conway, was that the issue=
 was resolved =09and the information was now flowing to the LDCs. Paul, Gar=
rett  and I are meeting senior HydroOne execs (including Rod Taylor) on Mon=
day re     =09=09resource adequacy issues and we can press this with them a=
s well. =09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=
=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09- with respect to the CIS issue, there is not much =
we can do since most  LDCs already have a CIS vendor; but my understanding =
is that at least =09=09one CIS vendor has backed out of its commitments to =
a number of LDCs recently (per David MacFadden) and perhaps we can get a ve=
ndor =09=09to move in quickly to fill that gap. I will raise this with Marr=
yott to see what may be feasible at this stage. =09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=
=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09- with respect to the cu=
stomer duplication issue, I have already met with the senior people at Dire=
ct (last week)  to discuss this issue with them and to =09propose a resolut=
ion that would see the retailers involved retaining a third party  (such as=
 E&Y)  to assess the degree of overlap and whether =09=09there was an accep=
table solution to any problem. Direct is convinced that the degree of dupli=
cation is not high.  Direct is talking to Onsource =09=09and Toronto about =
this. =09I am checking with our staff in the UK about whether there was a s=
imilar issue when the UK market opened and, if so, how it was =09resolved. =

 I and Dick Perdue (Direct's advisor) have contacted TransAlta, OPG, HydroO=
ne, Onsource, Enersource, =09=09and Toronto about funding a  Province- wide=
 consumer education initiative over the summer.  We are meeting next week t=
o discuss this idea =09=09 further.  This could require a financial commitm=
ent from Enron of  up to $200,000. =09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=
=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09- with respect to the conti=
ngency plan to deal with those LDCs who are not ready, the OEB is already o=
n side in recognizing the need for a contingency =09plan - it will likely b=
e very simple: the IMO  would send a bill to the LDC each month and the LDC=
 would bill customers at some fixed rate, with a deferral =09account). The =
key  issue will be how many LDCs (in terms of numbers and size)  are not re=
ady and what is the minimum number of LDCs that =09=09the OEB/gov't is look=
ing for to be ready. This is an issue we will have to talk to the MEST abou=
t as well as the OEB=09, since ultimately the =09=09=09decision of whether =
enough LDCs are ready will be a political one.=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=

Garrett/Paul - Can you guys work with the North East desk to price out a 50=
0MW option at the New York/Ontario intertie as an insurance policy for the =
Ontario government re market opening. You will recall that this was somethi=
ng we had suggested a while back and didnt receive much support. However, f=
ollowing Lavorato's meeting with Harris, Lavo is adamant that we send a ter=
m sheet to Harris directly outlining both an call option structure and a sw=
ap structure.=20

Second, it is quite apparant to me that everything hinges on the September =
readiness report. If its favorable, I think there is a good chance of a fal=
l market opening. With that said however, we are in the hands of the IMO an=
d the OEB. I'm comfortable that we can continue to influence the IMO to pro=
duce a favorable announcement but I dont know what we can do to ensure that=
 the OEB says its ready. Any suggestions, comments? I dont want to be in a =
position that one LDC  could halt market opening.=20

Rob
