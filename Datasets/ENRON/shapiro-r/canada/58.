																				Rick, I attach drafts of letters to Harris and Wilson.  The revised letter to Harris refers to the letter that Lavorato may send re the hedge proposal.  That added language will obviously have to come out if Lavo decides not to send his letter or if, by the time Lay's letter is to go, it is still uncertain whther Lavo will make his proposal.   Address for copy  of Wilson's letter to Purchase is  Bryne Purchase, Deputy Minister, Ministry of Energy Science &Technology, Hearst Block, 4th Floor, 900 Bay Street, Toronto, Ontario, M7A 2E1; Address for copy of Wilson's letter  to Judy Hubert is Judy Hubert, Assistant Deputy Minister, Energy Policy, Ministry of Energy Science &Technology, 3rd Floor, 880 Bay Street, Toronto, Ontario M7A 2C1.
