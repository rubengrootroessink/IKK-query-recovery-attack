The OEB announced earlier this week that they were  proposing to delay the deadline for the second stage of distributor self-certification re market readiness from August 10 to December 14.  The proposal is evidently based on the reports that the distributors filed on the first stage of self-certification on July 6.  Those reports have not been made public, so it is virtually impossible for stakeholders to comment on the need for or the propriety of the proposed delay.  I attach for your interest a copy of the Board's letter and a copy of my submissions to the Board re the proposal.  For what it is worth, the Minister's Office has told me that they are very "displeased" with the OEB because the OEB gave them no advance warning that a delay of the length proposed was being contemplated.
