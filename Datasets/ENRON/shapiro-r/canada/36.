JL took his own cut at the speaking notes (my "clean up" of same is

Here are the revised speaking points.  I have added several bullets  in Part 
2 re the decision to be made in September after receipt of the OEB/IMO 
reports .  I have also added several "notes to the reader" to explain 
certain  the points in the text.
