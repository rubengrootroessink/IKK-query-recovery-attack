Eric, I spoke today with Peter Varley and Tom McLaren re a more proactive media relations/advocacy effort in Ontario re market opening, that would include, among other initiatives,  meetings by Rick and myself  with the major regional papers/ news outlets outside Toronto - i.e. Hamilton, London, Windsor, Ottawa, Kingston, Sudbury , etc. I have asked Peter to prepare a plan and forward it to both of us next week  for our review upon my return after Labour Day.  Regards, Aleck
