Attached is the document from GPC - it is not quite what I asked for.  I would suggest that we ask them to focus on items 5 (Liberals), 7, 8 and 9. Would appreciate your thoughts.

Aleck, I trust you had a good holiday. Enclosed as promissed is a more
detailed outline of our proposed program for Enron Canada in support of the
Ontario Market Opening. I propose that you, me, Peter and Michael meet this
week to go over this in greater detail and to schedule our various
activities.

All the best
