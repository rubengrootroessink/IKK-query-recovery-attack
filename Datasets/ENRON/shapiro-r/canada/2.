Subject: NGX et al Litigation Settlement - Press Release

The following message is to go to everyone in Calgary and Toronto ASAP.

We have settled our lawsuit with NGX, Canadian Enerdata, OM Gruppen and 
Richard Zarzeczny, regarding the compilation and methodology for calculating 
the Alberta natural gas price indices published by the Canadian Gas Price 
Reporter.  By the terms of the settlement there will be a joint press release 
issued this morning regarding the settlement, which is to be the only public 
communication regarding the matter unless agreed to by all parties.  A copy 
of the press release is attached below.  Otherwise the settlement is 
confidential to the parties.  Accordingly, there is to be no formal or 
informal discussion with media, colleagues, competitors, counterparties or 
otherwise.  If you receive  request, simply reply that you understand that 
the matter is confidential, but the request can be referred either to Rob 
Milnthorp or me and we will respond as appropriate.

If you have any questions, please speak to Rob or me.

Peter Keohane.
