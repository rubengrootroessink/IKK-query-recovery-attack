Rick, I spoke to Rob Milnthorp about this and he indicated that one of the purposes of the email was to simply disclose the key commercial and commercial support contacts and that he appreciated both the legal and government affairs individuals described are not members of EES Canada but are rather members of their respective groups.  It was clear Rob felt the memo was appropriate and I frankly didn't choose to engage him in any further discussion/argument about how it could have been written so as to more accurately describe how members of the Government Affairs Group in Calgary and Toronto will provide Government Affairs support to EES Canada.
