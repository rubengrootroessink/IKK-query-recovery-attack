Attached is the link to a very good article that appeared in the National 
Post this morning.  The author, Terry Corcoran, is Canada's senior business 
writer and interviewed Ken Lay when he was here. You will see the references 
to Ken Lay and Enron.  Terry phoned me yesterday to indicate he had decided 
against running the piece today,  after a discussion with Dave Goulding, CEO 
of the IMO.   Goulding had evidently told him that there was no immediate 
urgency to  the gov't announcing a date.  Dave's concern is that if we press 
for a date now we may get the one we don't want (i.e. Spring 2002 rather than 
November 2001).  I told Corcoran that I understood Dave's concern but that 
there was a need for an early indication from the gov't  that they were 
targeting November in order that we maintain momentum among those bodies 
(primarily the distributors) which bear the primary responsibility to get the 
needed systems in place.  Eric Thode is forwarding a copy to John L.
