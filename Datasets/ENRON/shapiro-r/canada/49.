Met with GPC today re development of a regional media campaign and a program focused on keeping the Liberals on side (in addition to  our continuing efforts with the Government).  Can Ginger set aside a week of your time for a visit to Toronto and environs for that purpose -  sometime in October?  Once we get confirmation of your availability, we can proceed to schedule the events.  Thanks, Aleck -    P.S.           In any event, the President of GPC - Herschel Ezrin  (a very well connected Liberal)  - would like to invite you or Rob Milnthorp to the Prime Minister's Dinner (the major Liberal Party fundraiser) on Monday, September 24th.  Herschell has committed to introducing you or Rob on that occasion to senior federal cabinet ministers and key Ontario Liberal Party folks. Are you interested.  If you came on that occasion we would try to couple it with a meeting with Dalton McGuinty, Ontario Liberal Leader.
