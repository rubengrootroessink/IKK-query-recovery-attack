Rick, this idea of a 500MW option  was first raised by me in February as a solution to the concern about the availability of the first Pickering A unit (515MW) during the Winter 2001-2002.  It was dismissed summarily at that time.

Garrett/Paul - Can you guys work with the North East desk to price out a 500MW option at the New York/Ontario intertie as an insurance policy for the Ontario government re market opening. You will recall that this was something we had suggested a while back and didnt receive much support. However, following Lavorato's meeting with Harris, Lavo is adamant that we send a term sheet to Harris directly outlining both an call option structure and a swap structure. 

Second, it is quite apparant to me that everything hinges on the September readiness report. If its favorable, I think there is a good chance of a fall market opening. With that said however, we are in the hands of the IMO and the OEB. I'm comfortable that we can continue to influence the IMO to produce a favorable announcement but I dont know what we can do to ensure that the OEB says its ready. Any suggestions, comments? I dont want to be in a position that one LDC  could halt market opening. 

Regards
Rob
