We have intervened in Georgia Power's rate case.  Bob Frank will be our counsel and any issues regarding external communication about this case should be directed through him.  

We plan to address 3 issues: 1) GP's proposal for weather-related revenue sharing proposal (we'd like to see use of weather risk management; 2) support for GP's proposed capacity cost recovery rider, under certain conditions, and 3) reflection of risk reduction these first 2 issues would allow in GP's authorized ROE  (we will not address the underlying ROE).

Donald Lassere, Stella Chan and I will be working with Andy Anderson in URM and the weather desk (through Lisa Yoho)to develop our positions and testimony.
