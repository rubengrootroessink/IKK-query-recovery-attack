Thanks Ryan -- I hope that you will not hold it against me that I pulled you guys into the Illinois market!  On the other hand, and in my defense, I kept you out of South Dakota.

It looks excellent.   I vote to increase all numbers by 50%!

Joking aside, you have provided REAL educational and strategic value that I cannot put a price on.  The sucess of our standard products owe their winning structure, in large part, to you.  They are the only products/deals we are currently closing, and that says something.  You trained 3 brand new employees (me, Jeff, and Marc) in 6 weeks and prepared us to launch a value proposition that is currently the only value prop that is making $ in Illinois.

Thanks for your patience and continued support.

Hello All -- It's that time of year again where I am asked to list my accomplishments and provide some sense of whether such efforts were valuable.  Attached is a draft document I have created from a form used in Government Affairs and have provided some valuations in each of the main accomplishment areas.  I have tried to be fair but have undoubtedly provided inaccurate estimates of valuation.  Please take a moment to open the document and provide me with feedback regarding estimating value for services I have provided beginning November 2000 through April 2001.  Again, I do not seek to claim unfair recognition but also my efforts are justified in part by the value I bring to Enron and its business units.  This document will be revised and submitted prior to June 6, so please get back to me at you earliest convenience.  Thank you.
