Rick - Over the weekend we agreed to terms with PSE&G on a gas case 
requestiung the transfer of pipeline capacity contracts.  In return for our 
support, we obtained the following:
 Two three year gas storage deals with ENA;
 Three year Capacity Management, when Residential customers move to market 
prices, (probably within two-three years);
 5% Basic Generation Service when BGS market opens 8/02.

ENA is currently valueing the gas deals, however, my guess is they are worth 
approximately $3-5 million.  The cap mgt deal will be worth approximately 
$25-30 million, whiule the BGS will be a liitle difficullt to quantify at 
this point.  There was also a general understanding with Steve Teitleman, 
President PSEG Genco, to increase the business between ENA and PS, both in 
power and gas.  

I will forward the LOI when it is signed, probably within a few days.  As 
always please call if you wish to discuss the details.
