FYI, JDS Uniphase Corporation was one of the 150 California companies that 
received our direct access letter.  Please see the attached letter that they 
sent to the CPUC commissioners.

Thank you Mr. Pietrelli.  Your letter is straightforward, honest, and such an 
important part of the process.  I'll foward your letter to Chairman Lay 
immediately.  Thank you again for your interest in the issue and for taking 
time to contact the CPUC.

Subject:  JDS Uniphase Corporation Strongly Supports
      Retention of Direct Access and asks for CPUC Support

Dear Commissioner Geoffrey F. Brown:

My name is Kenneth D. Pietrelli, Vice President of Corporate Services for the
Thin Film Products Group(formerly OCLI and Flex Products) of JDS Uniphase in
Santa Rosa, California.  I am asking for your support to retain Direct Access 
as
an option for industrial energy customers such as JDS Uniphase.  Electricity 
and
natural gas are critical infrastructural requirements for our manufacturing
processes.  Without access to reliable sources, at high quality and 
competitive
prices we cannot satisfy our customers needs and be a viable business in
California.  We fear loss of direct access will have a material, adverse 
effect
on our business in California where we currently employ approximately 5,000
employees. JDS Uniphase is made up of such diverse groups as the original
Uniphase Commercial Lasers Group in San Jose and Manteca, the E-Tek Dynamics
Company in San Jose, SDLI in San Jose and Santa Clara and OCLI and Flex 
Products
in Santa Rosa.  The corporation has over 20,000 employees in over 20 
countries.
Of all the sites in California only the Santa Rosa site has direct access, 
which
is due to various historical and operational reasons.  We own a 22Mw 
substation
located on our 75 acre plant site and are considered a grid level customer.  
Up
to now we have enjoyed high quality, reliable electrical energy.  In the mid
1990's we began contracting directly for natural gas from other than PG& E and
are currently sourcing gas from Pan Canadian Energy via a single point gas 
meter
for the site.  In 1998 we entered into a 5 year direct access electricity
contract with PG& E Energy Services.  In 2000 this contract was assigned by 
PG&E
Energy Services to Enron and is valid through June 30, 2003.   Because of the
importance of energy availability, quality and price to our manufacturing
operations we have made business decisions on where capital investments have
been made and where redundant operations would be consolidated.  We are in the
process of a global re-alignment program that is consolidating numerous
activities to Santa Rosa, CA for a variety of reasons, to include our direct
access to energy.

 If direct access is eliminated in California, JDS Uniphase management will 
have
to re-assess and re-consider actions currently underway to consolidate
manufacturing from Rochester, NY; Ottawa, Canada; Dunfermline Fife, Scotland;
and San Jose, Ca to the Santa Rosa, CA site. Other locations on the East Coast
of the U.S., China, UK, etc. would have to be re-considered for these
consolidation activities.  Selfishly, we are asking you to retain direct 
access
to keep jobs in California.  Philosophically, we believe the "right to choose"
is an American tradition and anyone concerned with the long-term health and
viability of the California economy would want to retain the direct access
option for California customers.   Thanks for your time and support.
