I've still got considerable work to do, but wanted to make sure all had a 
chance to review and comment well in advance of finalizing.  I'm giving a 
talk at Exnet on Monday about California.  Attached is a draft of the 
slides.  All comments welcome and appreciated.  I'm continuing to work on 
it.  Thanks very much.

Best,
Jeff
