Rick:

I have attached the first "Solutions Document" we developed several weeks ago 
in advance of a trip Ken was making to CA. 

Below is a message with links to the more recent documents Ken used. 

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Jennifer

On the call on Friday, Linda asked if we could distribute materials 
developed/used recently in California regarding the crisis and solutions to 
try to resolve it.  Attached are:

A "backgrounder" provided to the business leaders that Ken Lay met with last 
week
A power point presentation that is a "higher level" discussion of the more 
detailed "backgrounder."

If I missed anyone, please forward along.  If anyone has any questions, give 
me a call at 415.782.7822.

Best,
Jeff
