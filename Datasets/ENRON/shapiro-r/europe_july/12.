Thanks for documenting the proposed expenditure, James.

I will swallow the rental on the new circuit because it is essential in ord=
er=20
to support three or four (rather than two) users in the Brussels office. An=
d=20
the other equipment quotes look OK. So please go ahead and place orders; as=
=20
you know, the lack of capacity on the current link has become insupportable=
 -=20
we are experiencing constant crashes, application impairments and=20
disconnections. I should add that when the time comes for installation we=
=20
will require hardware and software support and training.  And as you know, =
a=20
full Brussels hardware audit, completion of Outlook migration and completio=
n=20
of Windows 2000 migration are outstanding.

What I feel I cannot accept is a continuing charge to my cost centre for th=
e=20
entire old bandwidth contract with Equant, which you have not been able to=
=20
re-negotiate nor terminate. Frankly, the incompetent negotiation of the thr=
ee=20
year fixed capacity link deal by one of your predecessors in 1999, apparent=
ly=20
permitting no amendment during the term, should not become my budget proble=
m=20
in 2001-2. It was clear from the outset with this office that future=20
expansion and/or future closure would be just as likely as perfect stabilit=
y=20
of numbers. (Indeed who would ever want to predict three year stability for=
=20
any aspect of our Enron Europe operations?!) If you do not have the authori=
ty=20
to re-absorb the cost into an IT overhead, then we will have to refer the=
=20
question to Mark Pickering.=20

I am copying my four colleagues because they share with me elements of=20
budgetary reponsibility.=20
