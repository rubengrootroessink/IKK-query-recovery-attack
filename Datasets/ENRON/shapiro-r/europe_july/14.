Eva,
=01;
Is this the story that we were previously contacted about by the NRC?
=01;
I have not read it in detail but it clearly fingers (part) of the blame at=
=20
"producers" withholding capacity including some such as Enron! which=20
supposedly purchased old capacity (I am not aware that we did).
=01;
I am concerned about this story on 2 levels :-

1. It contains factual errors but suggests that lessons should be learnt by=
=20
Dutch regulators to avoid problem ie could lead to anti-liberalisation=20
backlash=01;and re-regulation (eg bring back the Protocol!).=01;=20
2. We, along with other=01; market parties, are currently encouraging=20
authorities in NL to tackle market power of the producers ie Electrabel,=20
Reliant etc.=01; Surprisingly, Reliant is NOT mentioned in respect of Calif=
ornia=20
price spikes but Enron is.=01; Whilst not a directly comparable situation, =
the=20
question over whether or not certain players have abused=01;market power=01=
;is=20
common.=01; I do not want Enron=01;"tarred with the wrong brush" in these=
=20
discussions, especially since Reliant (which is a producer in California!) =
is=20
getting away with it in NL!

Obviously, we do not want necessarilly want to stir up the hornet's nest on=
=20
this BUT also do not want incorrect statements; especially=01;about Enron a=
nd=20
California and especially where these can undermine our credibility/infleun=

in Netherlands.=01; Hence, should we ask NRC to correct...
=01;
Lets discuss.

See below attached news article. It describes a view on the Californian=20
