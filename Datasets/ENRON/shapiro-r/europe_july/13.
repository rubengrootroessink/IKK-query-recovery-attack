Thanks Neven. Please keep my four colleagues copied as we go forward on thi=

You will have seen that DG COMP are keen to find a reason to force EdF to=

criteria. If notification were to the Italian competition authority, remedi=

Definitely...I read through few research reports and finally managed to=20
understand who has placed what in Italenergia. Fiat has contributed its 600=
=20
MW of generation capacity and 3,000 MW of developable brownfield sites for=
=20
capacity. If one was to price the assets using the prices paid in the most=
=20
recent trade sales of comparable assets the value assigned should have been=

urrent=20
price and Fiat's stake in Italenegia (and consequently Montedison) is =14 ?=
1,200=20
million. Pretty valuable "Italian goodwill"

I have compiled a very summary of the most recent developments:

So....our speculation yesterday that, because of Agnelli family influence,=
