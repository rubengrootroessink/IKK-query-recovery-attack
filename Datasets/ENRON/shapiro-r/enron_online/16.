Rick:

Attached is the new draft of EOL / Energy Trading Q&A.   I have put this together for internal use only - so we're all on the same page in answering questions from regulators, legislators, the press, etc.    Mark Taylor has reviewed this document and provided comments, which I have incorporated in this draft.   

I would like to provide this to Mark Palmer and the DC office once you're comfortable with it.

Thanks,

Lisa
