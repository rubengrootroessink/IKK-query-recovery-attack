Steve:

ICE's execution engine is quasi-regulated by the CFTC as an "exempt commerc=
ial market" since they are a many-to-many platform.  We are comfortable tha=
t we can convince the CFTC that our new function (enhanced limit order)does=
 not change our status as a one-to-many platform. =20

ICE is a regulated clearing entity.  Although the clearing function that EO=
L will be providing is quite similar to the clearing function provided by I=
CE, it is a minor activity performed by our platform.  Moreover, we are sti=
ll a counterparty to every transaction - which is not the case with ICE.

Also, I wanted to let you know that Mark Taylor instructed Ken Raisler (our=
 outside CFTC counsel) to notify the CFTC that we will be offering enhanced=
 limit orders.   Ken has done so (by phone).

I hope this helps to clarify the distinctions between EOL and ICE.  Let me =
know if you need further information.

Lisa

Does this present the same regulatory issue we were facing with EOL?

Global-Energy: ICE to Offer Clearing for Oil, NatGas=20

Online commodities trading market IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) announced =
on 29 August that the London Clearing House (LCH) would provide clearing se=
rvices for over-the-counter transactions of WTI crude and Henry Hub natural=
 gas once the Commodity Futures Trading Commission grants regulatory approv=
al, which is not expected before October.  LCH was the clearing house for I=
nternational Petroleum Exchange (IPE), which ICE recently bought.  Jeff Spr=
echer, ICE Chief Executive, said the clearing services could "open up new t=
rading opportunities, increase the velocity of trading, and increase compan=
ies' ability to take on new risk," according to Reuters.  A broker told Dow=
 Jones that the move by ICE was "the 'shot fired across the bow' of its lar=
ger-volume competitor NYMEX...[and] will allow ICE and IPE to compete direc=
tly with NYMEX for Brent-WTI arbitrage business," as NYMEX will begin offer=
ing Brent crude contracts on 5 September.  NYMEX also intends to launch its=
 online trading system, eNYMEX, within four to eight months.  <font color=
=3D"#0084A5">ANALYSIS:  Any trading market lives or dies on the quality of =
its clearance processes.  ICE, as one of the largest electronic trading for=
ums, is under constant pressure to offer new services, as it attempts to pu=
ll potential traders from other online ventures and traditional floor excha=
nges.  CEO Sprecher said ICE's goal was to "plug into (the already existing=
 futures market) infrastructure and develop a new paradigm for the OTC mark=
ets on some way of clearing, settling or netting," according to <i>Platts</=
i>.  NYMEX's electronic trading efforts are consistently delayed.</font>
