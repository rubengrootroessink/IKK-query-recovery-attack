We do not seem to be answering the questions and the format makes it pretty=
=20
difficult to understand where we are answering each question.  Is this a=20
style we use with FERC?  If so, fine.  But if not, here's my attempt, I hav=
e=20
changed quite a few answers too.

Question1: In providing an answer to our questions regarding risk assessmen=
t=20
or management, would you please provide an explanation to the following?  W=
e=20
understand that EOL requires that a counter party, before accessing EOL to =
do=20
business with Enron North America, must undergo a credit worthiness=20
evaluation.   When a counter party executes or clicks on a price, EOL does =
an=20
instant credit check before confirming the transaction.
However, Enron may not only buy from a counter party, it may sell.  What so=
rt=20
of creditworthiness standards must Enron provide to a counter party utilizi=
ng=20
EOL to purchase from Enron?
Are there industry standard creditworthiness agreements regarding counter=
=20
party credit risk that Enron uses?  If yes, may we have copies?  If Enron=
=20
utilizes its own agreements, please provide us with a copy.

All counterparties are assessed by our credit department prior to any=20
transaction being entered into by Enron whether the transaction is being=20
conducted over the phone or through EnronOnline.  Enron, as the principal t=
o=20
all purchases and sales on EnronOnline and when completing transactions on=
=20
the telephone or in writing, requires counterparties to be creditworthy.  I=
n=20
addition, Enron=01,s risk management process is required to be approved by =
the=20
Enron Board of Directors, according to Securities Exchange Act regulations =
as=20
a publicly held company.  Enron=01,s risk policies are provided in Enron=01=
,s=20
publicly available [[10-Q??]]_______ audited financial statements filed on =
a=20
quarterly and annual basis with the SEC.  Enron maintains a separate risk=
=20
management group that has oversight over all transactions done by all Enron=
=20
trading units and that ensures compliance with the risk management policies=
. =20
This group has a separate reporting line directly to the office of the=20
Chairman of Enron Corp. and has the authority to instruct the suspension of=
=20
transactions in order to ensure that trading limits are not exceeded.  In=
=20
addition, every counterparty of Enron has to clear a credit check before th=
ey=20
can transact through EnronOnline.  The Credit Risk Management group approve=
s=20
a counterparty for a specific credit limit and tenor limit which are embedd=
ed=20
within the EnronOnline database.    Every transaction is passed through an=
=20
electronic credit check to assure that the credit limits and tenor limits a=
re=20
not violated prior to Enron accepting the counterparty=01,s bid or offer vi=
a=20
EnronOnline, such credit checks are done automatically and there is no huma=
n=20
intervention.  As with all Enron transactions, the credit limit checks=20
utilize a potential exposure calculation to take into account future price=
=20
volatility.  The Credit Risk Management group monitors transaction flow on=
=20
all Enron transactions including EnronOnline continually.   EnronOnline doe=
s=20
provide CRM with electronic alerts when customers approach credit limits or=
=20
breach credit limits.  No further transactions are executed unless CRM is=
=20
sufficiently satisfied that the credit position has been mitigated such tha=
t=20
credit limit is still available.

EnronOnline uses the same credit policy as other transactions Enron enters=
=20
into, whether we are buying or selling.  The transactions entered into on=
=20
EnronOnline are all governed by either a Master Agreement or the General=20
Terms and Conditions (which are a shorter form of contract and differ for=
=20
each commodity, these are all available on the web-site).  A Master Agreeme=
nt=20
is negotiated with the Counterparty offline and includes negotiated bilater=
al=20
credit terms and these terms govern any transactions entered into on=20
EnronOnline.  The General Terms and Conditions which will apply to=20
EnronOnline transactions if there is no Master Agreement in place between=
=20
Enron and the counterparty include industry standard credit requirements=20
which the counterparty chooses to accept or not online, should the=20
counterparty not want to accept to language in the contract (for credit or=
=20
other reasons), the Helpdesk for EnronOnline will facilitate contact betwee=
n=20
the Enron Credit group or Enron Legal group with the counterparty allowing=
=20
the Counterparty to negotiate terms which may be more appropriate to them.

Question 2:    I understood Dave Forster to state that EOL does not collect=
=20
data regarding where a customer's mouse is moving on the system.  However,=
=20
does EOL require customers to have cookies enabled?   If yes, does EOL=20
collect, use or manage data regarding cookies?

It is correct that Enron does not collect data regarding where a customer's=
=20
mouse is moving on the system.  It is also correct to note that we have no=
=20
capability of knowing where the customer's mouse is. =20

EnronOnline does not require customers to have cookies enabled. =20

Question 3: Also, why doesn't EOL publish a "ticker" of completed trades=20
showing prices and quantities?  Does EOL have any plans to start publishing=
=20
such data?  If yes, when?

There are now several options for viewing historical pricing/transaction da=
ta=20
from EnronOnline.  Reuters recently began showing quotes from EnronOnline=
=20
(http://about.reuters.com/enrononlinequotes/), which also provides customer=
s=20
with the ability to reference historical prices from the date at which they=
=20
acquire access.  In addition, EnronOnline provides a number of online chart=
s=20
for products, which graphically depict historical transaction prices. =20
Customers can also run reports to see their own transactions and download t=
he=20
results into an Excel spreadsheet on EnronOnline  The system also allows fo=
r=20
administrative users, thereby allowing the back offices of counterparties t=
o=20
monitor the trading activity and deal with it appropriately in line with=20
their own systems.

Enron does not publish transactions completed via EnronOnline however Enron=
=20
will provide information on such transactions in order to ensure market=20
activity is being correctly reflected in the approriate market indices. For=
=20
example, Enron does provide EnronOnline transaction data to the Natural Gas=
=20
Exchange in Calgary in order to ensure that indices produced by Canadian=20
Enerdata accuately reflect the activity in the market place (this will=20
commence on July 1, 2001).  At the end of each day, EnronOnline makes=20
available to all customers through EnronOnline the weighted average price o=
f=20
that day's transactions.  The data associated with US Natural Gas is sent i=
n=20
this format to Gas Daily for inclusion in their automated exchange index.

Question 4:  In addition, how does the data collection from EOL/Enron=20
Networks flow to the risk management groups?  How is the information used?

EnronOnline transactions are sent to different risk management groups=20
depending on the type of commodity transacted.  For example, the group that=
=20
handles U.S. gas settlements is not the same group as the one handling=20
Australian Power.  The transactions are transmitted to the appropriate back=
=20
office utilizing a =01&bridge=018:  a process that is capable of communicat=
ing=20
transaction information into the variety of systems that Enron operates. Th=
e=20
potential for manual input error is thereby removed providing Enron and the=
=20
customer with more efficient recording of the transaction. The back office=
=20
systems at Enron use transaction information as an input into various=20
functions, such as invoicing, preparation of financial statements, risk=20
management and credit.  These back office systems are used to track=20
transactions from all sources, including EnronOnline, the telephone, other=
=20
trading systems, etc.  Information is maintained on these systems according=
=20
to accounting and regulatory rules, regardless of the source of the=20
transaction.

The Enron commercial employee, who is offering to buy or to sell through=20
EnronOnline, does so through a price management software application, this=
=20
notifies him immediately that a transaction is completed.  The counterparty=
,=20
the Enron commercial employee and the risk management groups are all notifi=
ed=20
by the system at the same time. =20

The data from an EnronOnline transaction is used in exactly the same way as=
=20
information is used from any transaction completed by Enron. When a=20
transaction is completed, EnronOnline serves purely as a deal capture syste=
m=20
that captures the data necessary to feed to our risk management system. =20
Enron Online does not feed settlement systems or credit systems.  It does,=
=20
however, automate our deal capture system, which improves the data feeds to=
=20
our settlement and credit systems.

Question 5: Also, we assume that data regarding each trade is maintained by=
=20
EOL.  If yes, in what form and for how long?

EnronOnline transactions are captured in the EnronOnline database.  The=20
transactions are 'bridged' (duplicated) onto the various systems (databases=
)=20
managing the underlying commodity (the risk system associated with the=20
commodity).  We currently intend to store the data for a period of six year=
s=20
post a transaction completing (for example, deliveries finishing) and this =
is=20
policy across all databases.

In general, EnronOnline is an electronic trading platform that offers free,=
=20
real-time pricing information for approximately 1,800 products for 13=20
commodities, including electricity and natural gas.  EnronOnline utilizes=
=20
e-commerce and Internet technology to conduct trading business that=20
previously took place on the telephone and by fax.   EnronOnline is a=20
proprietary, or =01&one-to-many=018 trading platform. On a =01&one-to-many=
=018 platform,=20
one entity, such as Enron, is the principal to every trade (unlike a =01&br=
oker=018=20
type platform). =20

EnronOnline allows buyers and sellers to act on prices that can change by t=
he=20
second.  Buyers or sellers can also see real-time price spreads of both the=
=20
sell price and the buy price.  For example, on the telephone, a buyer=20
previously would call to ask about gas prices for each of the next six=20
months, but by the time the trader finished reciting the prices, some price=
s=20
could have changed.  EnronOnline allows counterparties to see the =01+bid a=
nd=20
offer prices=018 all the time to make more informed decisions.

The energy products offered on EnronOnline are subject to federal oversight=
=20
as follows:   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (=01&CFTC=018) has=
=20
enforcement authority over physical transactions on EnronOnline to police f=
or=20
potential manipulation.  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has=20
regulatory authority over physical natural gas and electricity sales for=20
resale. =20

The CFTC has anti-fraud and anti-manipulation enforcement jurisdiction over=
=20
financially settled derivatives (swaps and options).  Moreover, pursuant to=
=20
the Commodity Exchange Act (=01&CEA=018), Enron can only trade derivatives =
with=20
counterparties that qualify as sophisticated according to such rules.  Such=
=20
transactions are permitted as long as both parties are Eligible Contract=20
Participants (=01&ECPs=018)(generally, corporations, partnerships and other=
=20
entities that meet net worth or asset tests). =20

EnronOnline is a proprietary, bilateral trading platform on which Enron is =
a=20
principal to every trade.  As such, EnronOnline is not a =01&trading facili=
ty=018=20
as defined under the CFMA.  As a proprietary platform, EnronOnline uses=20
Internet technology to provide another method of communication between Enro=
n=20
and its customers. =20
