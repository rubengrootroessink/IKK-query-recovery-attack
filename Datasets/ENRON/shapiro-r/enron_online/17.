Attached are answers to commonly raised questions regarding EOL and energy trading.  I prepared this to ensure that we are all working from the same page in answering legislative / regulatory / press questions.

This document is for internal use only (ie, not for distribution), and has been reviewed and approved by Mark Taylor and Rick Shapiro.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks.

Lisa
