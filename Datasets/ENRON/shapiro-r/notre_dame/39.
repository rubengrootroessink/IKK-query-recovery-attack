=09Are there any plans for either Enron or Dynegy (or both) to initiate inf=
ormation dissemination to Capitol Hill, as is usually
=09done in these situations?  This is what I have experienced when on the H=
ill and when representing companies either
=09being acquired or doing the merger/acquisition.  Our friends on the Hill=
 will wonder where we and they have been,
=09particularly if, as is likely, we may need them later on.  Better to get=
 in with them on the ground floor.  I know there is a
=09lot going on, but it would be beneficial to the merger approval process =
to at least have informal contacts starting this week
=09before they leave for Thanksgiving.

=09Thanks for the conference calls to keep us up to date and for being cand=
id in doing so.

=09John
