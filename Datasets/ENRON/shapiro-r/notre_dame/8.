If Notre Dame is brought to closure( my hope is that it will), once that oc=
curs, I'd like to figure out with you, or whomever you deem appropriate fro=
m Dynegy a couple of things: 1) We currently have 65 government affairs pro=
fessionals at Enron around the globe( 55 in North America, including the Wa=
shington office)..I anticipate making significant job cuts early in the tra=
nsition and would like to make sure that the cuts are being done with the m=
erged company fully in mind; 2) As you have seen from our disclosures, we h=
ave many more regulatory approvals associated with the Enron Assets as comp=
ared to Dynegy's- I'd like to work with you or whomever you designate to de=
termine  the most efficient way to process these filings through to approva=
l. My intent with this e-mail is not to further burden the next couple of c=
ritical days, but merely to raise the issues so we're in a position to talk=
 and meet soon thereafter. I think you will find in the government affairs =
professionals here the same commitment to excellence and integrity which ch=
aracterizes the folks I've come into contact with at Dynegy. I'll wait to h=
ear from you. Good luck in the next few days.
