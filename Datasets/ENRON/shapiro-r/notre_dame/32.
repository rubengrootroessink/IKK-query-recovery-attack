Attached is a rough draft for our PUCT filing.  Initial review (subject to
check with Enron) is that the combined parties generation in the ERCOT
region will exceed the 1% review threshold but be far below the 20% action
level.  I roughed out the elements of a filing based on the Dynegy/Illinova
docket from two years ago.  I have a meeting scheduled with Chairman
Yzaguirre tomorrow afternoon--thought I might provide him with the table on
generation interests within ERCOT and alert him to the pending request.
