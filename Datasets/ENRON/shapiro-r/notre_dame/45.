Thanks for the input.  Attached is the current version of the data to
support the PUCT filing.  I have had a couple conversations with Richard
Greffe of PUCT staff regarding the requirements of 25.401 and plan to walk
him thru the backup workpapers by the end of the month to get any
suggestions.  I did mention to Chairman Yzaguirre at a meeting earlier this
week that we might be bringing a filing to the Commission but that it was
just at the notice threshold--will  mention, as well,  to the other two
Commissioners in meetings next week.  While we could possibly play with the
numbers and/or timing of the filing to get below the 1% threshold, my
inclination is to make a simple informational filing out of an abundance of
caution and to create good will.
