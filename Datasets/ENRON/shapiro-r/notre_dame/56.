Peter Esposito just called to report on his discussions with the OPUC Commissioners.  He stated that discussions were cordial and friendly--even to the point of sharing a laugh or two with Joan Smith.   Not much of note in any of the conversations.  Chr. Hemingway stated that Dynegy would have to file under 757.511.  Comm'r Smith stated that they would see what could be done about expediting consideration of the application.  In the context of the comment on timing, Comm'r Smith told Peter to "be straight with the Commission."  The Commissioners all asked when to expect the NWN filing.
