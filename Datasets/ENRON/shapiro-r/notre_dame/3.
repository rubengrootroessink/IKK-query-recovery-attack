1.	Dynegy vs. ComEd at FERC

Dynegy filed a complaint at FERC that tries to disallow Firm LD from being used by marketers under the ComEd Network Service.  IP claims that is losing $ MM because customers are not paying for Capacity.  This will impact our ability to "go physical" starting next year.

2.	MISO vs. ARTO

IP is a member of the ARTO.  EPMI continues to try and establish only one RTO in the region.  I think this is why Dynegy won't state very clearly that 4 RTOs makes sense.  No $ impact, although this decision may impact our ability to "go physical" starting next year in Illinois.

3.	CTC Bet in ComEd

My recollection (talking with Harry K.) is that we pre-sold a CTC roll-off in ComEd that could cost our business around $10 MM if it doesn't happen.  Most talk in Illinois is that CTC should end early for big customers, so not sure if this is an issue.

4.	Delivery Service Tariff Litigation

ComEd and IP have filed to increase their rates on Delivery Service Tariffs (but not on Bundled customers because there is a statutory rate cap).  EES told us originally that this could cost as much as $50MM, but current estimates are closer to $10MM for ComEd and $2MM for IP.

5.	PPO (Power Purchase Option) Termination

ComEd is pushing to end the PPO service.  PPO provides a re-sell service to marketers while sharing the Mitigation Factor with customers.  It is the service we use to "deliver" today in ComEd.  IP will probably terminate this service because their stranded costs are expected to end sooner, hence, not a major issue for IP?

6.	Relative Size of Current EES Book

ComEd	=	7.8 MM Mwh (extends through 2010)
IP	=	1.3 MM Mwh (extends through 2008)

Hope this helps.  Data will improve with more time.
