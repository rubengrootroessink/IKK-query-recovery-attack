Rick -- In our experience, it is generally helpful to send a letter to a foreign leader before a telephone call or meeting -- it helps frame the meeting and permit the leader to brief himself on the relevant issues, and therefore generally makes the meeting more productive.

That's why I suggested that Neal put together the substance of a letter (which I would anticipate would strongly set forth the equities in favor of the Jose project) that we could then have in the can for use when time comes to request a phone call/meeting.

I'll be traveling Thursday and Friday, but Stephen Donehoo and Gary Falle will be available and will know how to reach me if needed.

Nelson
