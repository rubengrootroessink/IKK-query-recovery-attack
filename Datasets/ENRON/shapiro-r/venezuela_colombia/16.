Keith,
Thanks a lot for your help. Please let me coordinate with Emilio. 

Rick,
Diosdado Cabello is the Minister of Information, and very close to Chavez. We have met before and he is one of the most progressive members of his cabinet. He was responsible for the hihgly praised opening of the Telecom sector in Venezuela. Regards,
ALF

Alberto:  Joe Duggan, who is advising Amb. Arcaya as a consultant, has offered to convey a message to the Chief of Staff regarding Jose.  I told him that I'm not the responsible person on the project, but that I would share his kind offer with the appropriate person in Enron.  Keith
