I am attaching the presentation from the May 7th EGM all-employee meeting.   
Due to time constraints, the meeting covered only four of the EGM markets:   
coal, LNG, weather and crude/products.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Lisa

Cathy -

Do you have an electronic copy of the presentations that were made on May

Thanks.
