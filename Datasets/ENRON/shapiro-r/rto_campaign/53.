We'll have both Facts about FERC's RTO Order talking points and the Bare Essentials piece to distribute during the joint meeting of the Electricity and ERE committees' discussion of the draft on Monday morning.  I think that should cover our bases.  If you have any edits to the documents, let me know.

Are you sure?  It seems to us that what you mentioned to Lynne is closer
to Section V, C, 3.  What section of IV is the problem?  We'll have all
of our recent RTO handouts at NARUC to distribute.

Rick, what section of the draft specifically is it that you spoke with
Lynne about?  I'll see if we can come up with some alternative language.
