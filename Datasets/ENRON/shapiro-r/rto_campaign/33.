Virtually everyone wants us to move forward, define some market rules, define some new tariff rules, so that a little guy, a trader in Arkansas that wants to trade in Maine, can do so easily without having to understand rules for 17 different RTOs.

We're going to move quickly." - FERC Commissioner William Massey on RTO week.
