RTO Week

Day 2 -- October 16, 2001

Congestion Management and Transmission Rights

The morning panel discussed congestion management.  The panelists were:  Na=
ncy Brockway, Commissioner New Hampshire PSC; Reem Fahey, Edison Mission; C=
arol Guthrie, Chevron/Texaco; Shmuel Oren, University of California - Berkl=
ey and advises Texas PUC; Andy Ott, PJM; Michael Schnitzer, NorthBridge Gro=
up.

General Observations

The Commissioners were again all present (Wood left mid-morning to give tes=
timony on Capitol Hill).  Today, however, FERC Staff was much more active i=
n the discussion and the commissioners asked very few questions.  The topic=
s are so interrelated that many of the same issues already discussed are be=
ing rehashed again.  This will probably continue for the rest of the week. =
 What I have found most encouraging so far has been the widespread support =
for some of the basic concepts, most notably the need for a real time energ=
y market based using LMP.  Very few panelists have opposed this; at most, a=
 couple of panelists have argued that the real time market should not be st=
andardized -- basically conceding that PJM's system is not going to change =
in the Northeast but urging that it not be mandated everywhere else.   =20

Opening Statements

Nancy Brockway:  focus on two topics:  1) flowgate vs. LMP; and 2) relation=
ship between congestion management (CM) and resource planning.  She support=
s LMP and standard market design in New England.  Flowgate rights are cumbe=
rsome, create unnecessary uplift costs - freezing power distribution factor=
s is bad and could result in some free rides.  She is a Hogan follower, and=
 Hogan says flowgates can be done but are too difficult.  With regard to th=
e relationship between CM and resource planning, transmission is a monopoly=
, and the CM principle is that entrepreneurs make a decision - decide where=
 to site generation or transmission and take a risk.  FERC should not overr=
ide that principle.  Proposals for transmission expansion can undercut cong=
estion management.

Reem Fahey:  RTO needs to be the grid operator and the market operator.  Ca=
nnot use different bid stacks for balancing and congestion.  CM should have=
 a bid-based structure with LMP.  Design of CM should allow flexibility for=
 market participants to be in the spot and forward markets.  Transmission r=
ights - must be financial and not physical and must allow for financial hed=
ging in real time.  FERC should work towards the creation of trading hubs a=
nd market participants should have rights from hub to hub and hub to load. =
 These rights should not interfere with real time dispatch of the system.

Carol Guthrie:  Her company has diverse interests in electricity market - o=
ver 4,000 service locations, over 150 suppliers, more than 15 sites where t=
hey have industrial generation serving own load (500 MW). =20

Shmuel Oren:  Advocates minimal ISOs, direct assignment of congestion costs=
 in real time, flowgate rights proposal because it requires less centralize=
d coordination and supports forward rights.  Does not support "one size fit=
s all."  Need to understand gaming, modes of market failure.  Problems in T=
exas - people scheduled to cause congestion and then were paid to relieve t=
he congestion.  Need to charge for true congestion when it is predictable.

Andy Ott:  There is consensus in the industry that locational pricing works=
.  It's an operational tool used to manage reliability of the gird during c=
onstraints.  PJM has been using nodal pricing since 1998.  Utilities have r=
un their system on this approach for years - economic dispatch to meet dema=
nd.  Cannot do balancing and CM separately -- does not work.  Transmission =
rights must be financial.  Spot market is physical.  Financial model is the=
 hedging.  You need this separation because it allows players to do bilater=
als or buy or sell from the spot market.  Also allows FTRs to be traded and=
 used to protect from congestion. =20

Michael Schnitzer:  There is a preferred method of CM - the LMP based CM sy=
stem with financial rights.  DAM and RT bid-based security constrained loca=
tional pricing markets.  Bilateral transactions are allowed.  Transmission =
rights must be financial, not physical.  Allows transmission users to hedge=
 congestion costs.  Why is CM so important?  Need to get the prices right t=
o give the right signals to the market.  Three goals:  1) get dispatch righ=
t - show bilateral contracts and load the right price signal so they can re=
spond accordingly; 2) price signals to generation for location purposes - c=
larifies responsibility and risk allocations; 3) market signals for when to=
 expand the grid - LMP gives economic price signal and property right in FT=
Rs.

Locational Marginal Pricing

The panelists all agreed that LMP in the real time market is necessary (Sch=
muel Oren does not oppose it).  Most of the panelists think this needs to b=
e standardized across RTOs.  Andy Ott says the seams will remain a problem =
and a barrier to trading if the real time market is not standardized.   Car=
ol Guthrie does not favor standardization and urged FERC to not standardize=
 the PJM system throughout the eastern interconnect.  She said FERC should =
try a couple of different systems and see what works. =20

FTRs versus Flowgates

The panelists agreed that transmission rights should be financial, not phys=
ical.  Schmuel conceded this point for the discussion but this may not be h=
is preference - unclear.  Most of the panelists, including the PSC commissi=
oner, prefer FTRs rather than flowgates.  Schmuel is a flowgate advocate.  =
After some discussion, the panelists agreed that FTRs and flowgates could w=
ork together, provided that the definition of flowgate is understood.  Andy=
 Ott said flowgates could work with FTRs if the purpose of having flowgates=
 is the same purpose of having hubs (liquidity, standard product), and if a=
 flowgate is defined as a grouping of point-to-point rights, then FTRs and =
flowgates can coexist.  If a flowgate is a hub for transmission rights, it'=
s okay.  However, if flowgate is defined as a physical boundary requiring s=
cheduling, the two cannot coexist.  Schmuel seemed to agree with this premi=
se, although this is not his preference.  He seems to prefer only flowgates=
 without FTRs.   Brockway seems to prefer FTRs rather than flowgates for fe=
ar that flowgates will result in excess socialization of costs.

The panelists also agreed generally that revenues generated from FTRs or fl=
owgates should be allocated to load, but the method of allocation was not a=
greed upon.

FERC staff asked the panelists to discuss commercially significant flowgate=
s.  Many of the panelists discussed the problem with deciding what constitu=
tes a commercially significant flowgate, and what happens when circumstance=
s change over time, resulting in different flowgates being commercially sig=
nificant.  Schmuel said you could use either a system that relies only on c=
ommercially significant flowgates or one that uses all flowgates, but if pa=
rticipants are willing to accept a system where they are not perfectly hedg=
ed, use of commercially significant flowgates is acceptable.  The panelists=
 agreed that these financial rights (either FTRs or flowgates) should be tr=
adable in the secondary market.  The panelists disagreed on whether FTRs or=
 flowgates are actually more tradable.  Andy thinks FTRs are more tradable;=
 Schmuel thinks flowgates are more tradable.

 Options versus Obligations

The panelists discussed the benefits of having FTRs be options but also dis=
cussed the additional problems presented to the system operator if FTRs are=
 only options and the FTR holder is not required to flow or pay if it does =
not flow.  Andy Ott said options will most likely result in fewer FTRs bein=
g allocated.  Schnitzer says the issue must be resolved up front. =20

The afternoon panel was on Transmission Planning and Expansion.  Steve Walt=
on was a panelist and will be providing a summary of the discussion shortly=
. =20

 Let me know if you have any questions.
