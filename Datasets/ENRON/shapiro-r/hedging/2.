All--earlier this week the Minnesota PUC and the Department of Commerce 
jointly hosted a workshop on on "LDC RIsk Management".  There was a 
presentation by Ken Costello from NRRI based on a paper that he has written; 
a panel consisting of reps from Reliant Minnegasco, Xcel, UtiliCorp, Alliant 
and MDU Resources (Great Plains); and a presentation from Blake Herndon of 
Williams Energy.  The discussion focused exclusively on natural gas--nothing 
on power. Two of the five Commissioners sat in on parts of the presentation 
along with a number of staffers.

There was (as always seems to be the case) no clear indication from the 
workshop what actions would take place as a result of the discussion.  My 
sense would be that there may be an investigatory or study docket opened, but 
not a formal proceeding that would lead to any meaningful policy 
implementation requiring risk management to be utilitzed. I think that the 
PUC is open to approving modest plans that the LDC might bring before them, 
but they are not willing to be proactive.

Although it was not stated publically, in my private conversations with the 
utilities I got a strong sense that Xcel would be coming with some type of 
proposal--possibly a request for pass thru on limited premium costs.  Alliant 
and MDU will not, and I think Utilicorp will do something along the lines of 
filing for a fixed price option that will be offered to their residential 
customers. As  I had indicated in a previous e mail, Reliant has already 
gotten approval for pass thru of call option premiums and I think that they 
are also petitioning for a fixed price option for residential customers.

Call if you have any questions--#612-339-4599-- or would like copies of any 
materials.
