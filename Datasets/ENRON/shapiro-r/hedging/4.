Below are 3 presentations......
the first is the presentation from the MACRUC conference, the second is what I presented to the NYPSC, and the third is the backbone presentation I use for utilities regarding hedging and risk management.  They are all similiar with different twists to meet the audiences' needs, although without some verbal description, they probably won't make a lot of sense.  Call me if you have questions! 

Janine...look these over and see if this is what you had in mind for Indiana....If it is, I'll have to chat with Dave Duran ....just to make sure that this is an initiative he would like me to take

Dave -- I wanted to give you some great feedback I got on Janelle's hedging presentation at the NARUC conference.  Herb Tate, a former NJ commissioner, said that Janelle "knocked em dead."  Herb is now serving as the FERC judge's consultant for the "one" Southeast RTO mediation for the next month.

To the extent that our GA people think it makes sense, Janelle could meet with some of the PUCs in the South.  Many of them are attending the FERC mediation and some have expressed their thoughts that RTOs may not be necessary or helpful.  Thanks.
