Hi Steve,

The reason that I've used "DC Office" is that Linda has indicated that she 
wants to distinguish between your assignments and Allison's assignments.  I'm 
not sure if she's done this yet and I didn't want to presume anything.  If it 
works better to list your names individually I am happy to do that.  To be 
honest, though, I don't think Rick would be likely to interpret this to mean 
that your role is simply administrative.

Are you around at the end of the day today?  I have a meeting from 2:00-4:00, 
but maybe we could talk afterward about the other issues you raise.  Thanks,

Sue

Hi Sue:

This may be a function of the Washington office/EBS Government Affairs 
differing reporting relationships, but...

With the "DC office" appearing only in supporting roles on reports like 
these, Rick and Steve Kean are going to continue to have the impression that 
we exist to schedule meetings and execute plans formulated by others.  You 
know this is a sensitive point for me personally, but beyond that, it is 
important to my career development that I be seen as taking more of a lead.  
I suppose Allison would feel the same way once she becomes more comfortable 
and familiar with the issues.

Therefore, two requests.  

Would you consider listing Allison and me as individuals, not as "DC Office"?

Also -- and here I may be pushing it --  as you and I have discussed a couple 
of times, am I taking the lead in the cable issue?  What about the BLM 
issue?  I always appear to Rick and Steve to be supporting Scott on these 
initiatives.  In my own twisted mind, I think of myself as having more of a 
leadership role.

Sorry to continue to be ultra sensitive about this.  But frankly (just 
between the two of us, please) since we've just brought on 2 new Senior 
Directors in the past month (knocking me a couple of rungs down the seniority 
ladder in one fell swoop), I am trying to increase my visibility ... and 
maybe claim a little more credit for issues that I have before.

Happy as always to discuss.

Muchas gracias,
Steve
