It was supposed to have been happening ever since Andy has been in our group.  I don't have a cost center for Lloyd.  His HR rep is Kim Melodick.  Thanks

Christi - I don't think this is happening at this point (and confirmed with our HR rep).  Do we have a company/cost center for Lloyd?  We'll do the split through the timekeeping.

Thanks,
Elizabeth

We are good for continuation of the Andy 50-50 with Lloyd.  Lloyd said that we do not need to do anything and his payment will continue.
