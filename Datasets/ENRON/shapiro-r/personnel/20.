Janine, Here is my schedule

April 16th through May 18th -- vacation/leave of absence
May 21st - check in with you -- at that time if I have decided against making 
the change, we will begin to discuss reshaping my responsibilities.  
Otherwise, we will proceed with the following.
May 21st through June 21st - work part-time with Friday's and part of 
Monday's in the office.  Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday work from Cleveland. ( 
I would expect to be open to do some limited travel -- it would depend on the 
attendance policies of the professors) 
June 21st - sometime in July or August -- full-time in Columbus office.

Thanks!
