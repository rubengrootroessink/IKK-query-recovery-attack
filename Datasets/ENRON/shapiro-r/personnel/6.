Richard S. Shapiro
Managing Director & Senior Vice President
Government Affairs - The Americas
Enron Corp.
1400 Smith Street
Houston, TX 77002-7361

Dear Richard:

Thanks again for taking the time for our telephone call last Wednesday. I
thoroughly enjoyed our talk. As per your request, I've attached a copy of my
CV for your review.

What I hope and believe you will realize as you review my qualifications is
that my skills, experience, problem-solving capability and drive to succeed
uniquely position me to make an immediate and lasting positive contribution
to Enron's government relations and public affairs activities at many
levels.

Firstly, my experience within the Ontario government and the network of
contacts I've developed as a result would be of immediate value to Enron. We
both know that an intense, coordinated and targeted effort will be required
from now to beyond the next provincial election to ensure that the Ontario
market opens successfully and remains open. My unique understanding of the
key players and issues involved in the opening of the Ontario market could
be of significant value to your company through this period.

Secondly, even as local market-opening events play themselves out in
Ontario, a broader set of potential opportunities is appearing for Enron
continentally, with the Bush administration's push for a hemispheric energy
policy. The unveiling of the proposed package by the President has ignited a
continent-wide debate that will have significant impact on the shape and
substance of the policies finally adopted by governments across the
hemisphere. Clearly, it is in Enron's interest to participate in and shape
this debate, to ensure that the final policy packages enhance your economic
interests. To meet this goal, a clear set of objectives must be identified,
an effective strategy to accomplish them developed and a coordinated,
sustained campaign planned and executed. My understanding of the varied
issues and actors at play in this debate, coupled with my understanding of
how to strategically plan and manage persuasion campaigns would be of
significant value to Enron as you prepare to meet this goal on a continental
basis.

Lastly, in addition to providing value to Enron both locally and
continentally in the specific ways described above, I would appreciate most
the opportunity to provide value to your company at a truly macro level, by
helping you participate and succeed in the ongoing global debate on the
ideology of open markets, entrepreneurial activity and free trade. The
ideological conflict between advocates of the state and champions of
individual freedoms and choice can be seen at the heart of all of Enron's
challenges, be they in Ontario, India or elsewhere, and the debate - with
its' significant global implications - is far from over. History clearly
demonstrates that opening markets and freeing entrepreneurial and consumer
activity is the key to enhancing the quality of life for individuals across
the globe. By pursuing these noble goals, companies like Enron are
performing a global public good. Putting my skills to work for Enron in this
global debate would truly be my pleasure.

Once again, I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss with you my
qualifications and how I can assist Enron in achieving your government
relations and public affairs goals. Please feel free to contact me at your
convenience.

Yours truly,



Bill Hawkins
