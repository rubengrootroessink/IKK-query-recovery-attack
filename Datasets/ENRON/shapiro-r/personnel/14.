Rick, Jim: 

In a nutshell, an intelligent and bright achiever who can be of use to GA in 
many areas; global assets, EBS, and environmental come to mind very clearly.  
Her politeness, friendless, and actually openness,  indicate that she could 
be a very good team player.   She perceives her  experience in Enron as "very 
positive" and "constructive"; she worked on contractual issues related to 
Thermofloris, and Colombia-Panama Pipeline.

Risk Analytics is not her forte area, and a learning curve is needed.  
However, her abilities-clearly from the resume and from the way she explained 
the details of her experience--indicate that this curve may not be a steep 
one.  Actually, she would be a good addition to a well established Team in 
Risk Analytics in the future when legal issues and their associated risks are 
dealt with.   

I shall take the liberty to communicate with Amy again after she finishes her 
exams in the 3 weeks time and learn more about her points of strength and 
potential areas of contribution.

Of course, I shall keep you posted.
