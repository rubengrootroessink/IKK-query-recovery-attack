Dear all -- I have put together a script and a Q&A document for Rick's use in communicating to his group his business objectives over the next few weeks for reducing expenses.  Please review and provide your comments, questions and/or concerns.  I apologize for the very short turnaround, but Rick's employee tele-conference is scheduled for Friday morning at 10:30 a.m. so we'll need to finalize the script no later than EOB tomorrow.

In addition, I've included a Q&A document that we should deliver to employees immediately after the meeting.  There are a couple of the questions we need to finalize.  For time's sake tonight, I've not included the answers to some of the benefits questions; however, those answers are already defined and not negotiable, so I just need to cut and paste them into the document.  Please review this to ensure I've covered most questions that may come up, and provide your feedback on those questions that still need to be finalized.

Rick, can we meet late Thursday to review the documents and any feedback that Sharon and Sheila provides?  I'm available any time 2:00 or later?

 

Thanks for your quick review of this information.  Please give me a call with any questions, etc.
Thanks.
Jo Ann
