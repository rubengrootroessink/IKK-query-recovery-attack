Rick

I was in Zurich on Friday and had an interesting discussion with Mauro 
Renggli - head of our office there. The discussion and
suggestions (below) were wholly at Mauro's instigation.

Over the past several months, Viviana has been tracking development in the 
Swiss market and providing updates etc. to Mauro and his 
team. He seems quite pleased with the work she is performing for him and has 
asked if I would be supportive of Viviana transferring to 
the Zurich office for 3+ months to work with his team. I told him I would 
think about it. From my perspective, this may be a very useful
step: 1) It allows her to get closer to a market she is already tracking for 
reg. affairs and which is headed for some important developments
ove the coming 6 months, 2) she is already a known and appreciated quantity 
there, and 3) most importantly, she would be able to 
work more closely with the small team there and perhaps get some of the 
additional support and guidance that I have not been able to 
provide.  Viviana has apprarently already voiced her interest in working in 
Switzerland.

Can you please call me before you speak to Viviana. Would welcome your take 
on this.

Thanks, Paul
