Rick:

Hope it is not getting too hot. I actually hadn't received anything to date in the way of basic package and therefore hadn't 
gotten back to you or Jaime. If something was sent that I missed, please re-send it.  I will give you a call tomorrow afternoon (Thursday) if that works for you. The atmosphere at Enron Europe (incl. reg. affairs) is pretty poor these days as the axe falls. It is genuinely unfortunate that we are getting hit as hard as we are and are really losing some good people. I trust you guys will  be spared. Take care

Hasta manana, 
Paul

I sent an email to Madeline Fox in London to enlist her help with a relo package.  In addition, I talked to Susan Helton who kind of oversees the payroll accounting function.  She suggested that Tim Callahan put Paul in touch with the consultants we use in Mexico regarding tax questions.  I have a call into Tim as well.  Both know that we are shooting for an 11/16/01 effective date.

Kim Melodick's group will help in preparing the final offer letter and coordinating everything with Paul as they are the liaisons with the folks in Monterrey.
I'll followup with both today/tomorrow.
Thanks.
Jo Ann

Rick -- Here are a couple of documents for your review for the potential transfer of Paul to Mexico.  I have a call in to Kim Melodick, in particular regarding the paragraph on Christmas Bonus and vacation premium.  In addition, I have a call in to Tim Callahan to discuss the transition process from an legal perspective -- VISA requirements, work permits, etc.

I'll keep you posted on the results of our discussions.
Thanks.
Jo Ann
