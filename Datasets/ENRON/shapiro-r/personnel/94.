As you have been notified, your last day at work will be 11/30/01.  However, the terms of your separation agreement remain in effect and your actual termination date will be the date listed in your document.   You will still be noted as an "employee" and continue to have access to email and voicemail remotely; however, for all intents, you will no longer be conducting business activities.    

In addition, Sonja Galloway will be contacting you to schedule a telephone exit interview sometime during the week of November 26th.  During this session, we will review your exit package, including benefits, etc., and will discuss arrangements to turn in all Enron assets (i.e., AMEX cards, calling cards, building badge, parking cards, etc.).  Also, please start preparing a final expense report so we will be able to close out any remaining expenses you may have.  We will be going over your entire exit package, so please review prior to the exit interview so any questions you may have can be resolved.

Again, I will be out of the office next week, but will be available by cell phone --> 713-503-5046.  Also, Sonja Galloway will be in the office Monday and Tuesday and would be able to assist you.

I wish you a very happy Thanksgiving holiday.  
Jo Ann
