Rick, Schnichels is positive, but has concern about timing (not now, but in 6 
months) and also, exactly what would he do? I said that we could arrange for 
him to meet the right people, but the ball is in his court for the moment; he 
wants to speak to his wife. Definately wants to moe to Frankfurt. Brendan
