FYI:

On Friday, the Maryland Public Service Commission issued a "Notice of Retail Gas Market Conference" scheduled for September 25.  They are looking for public input on the following issues:

*     what lessons did we learn from last winter (we could talk all day...)?
*     what new initiatives are needed to promote choice in gas?
*     what issues are raised by defaulting gas suppliers?
*     how do the LDCs plan to participate in the retail market in the future? (staff tells me that the Commission is interested in hearing what we think the future role of the LDC should be)

Comments are due on September 11th. 

Lisa
