Rick - Just a quick note on Tom and Frank. On Thursday 10/4/01, Tom testified before the MD PSC with respect to the NE RTO and Frank testified before the NJ BPU with respect to the future Basic Generation Service (Default Service).  Based on feeedback that I've received from outside sources, both Tom and Frank did an Excellent job.  SM
