I have spoken to LY regarding this already.  I've asked Lisa, given her 
relationship to sit down with Calvin and I and get a "lay of the land" to set 
a strategy to go forward.  This issue is coming up throughout the region, NJ, 
NY MD etc.  I have been discussing various strategies with Jeff Ader (EES) 
and Frank Vickers (ENA) to prepare for these cases.  I will advise. Questions 
give me a call.

Rick: 

I'm forwarding this email to you for a couple of reasons.  By way of 
background, Calvin is the most senior staffer at the Maryland PSC on energy 
matters.   First, I thought you'd be interested to know that Kathleen has 
tried to hire him.  Second, and more importantly, the Maryland Commission is 
beginning to look into default service for gas.    This may be a good 
opportunity for Enron to advocate our positions on the appropriate role for 
LDCs with respect to the merchant function (and provider of risk management 
services).   While we don't have a lot of business in Maryland, we may have a 
better chance at setting good precedent with Maryland than with some of the 
other states.   Just a suggestion.
   
Let me know if you want more info.  

Best,

Lisa

Saw someone on the street yesterday that could have been your near twin
sister, so I remembered I haven't emailed lately. Kathleen wanted be to be
the regional regulatory person for New Power. Her phone message wasn't
quite so blatent, but Susan Covino made it clear. I thought about it for
awhile, but decided I wouldn't want to drive to Harrisburg alot - and I'm
sure there would be a fair amount of driving to Richmond in the near future
too.

The main electric excitement is still the universal service disaster. That
obviously doesn't have much to do with electric choice, but there hasn't
been a dull moment all year and it is unlikely things will be running
smoothly any time soon. We have three big cases working during the summer
and fall. Constellation is doing their retail/wholesale separation into two
separate companies. Pepco and Conectiv are merging. Pepco's divestiture
sharing will be much messier than we thought because we believe they are
overcounting their transition cost (which subtracts from the share of the
plant sale proceeds going to customers) by quite a few millions of dollars.
All that and the ongoing workgroup process I need to get going on universal
service and other low-income issues will keep us busy. We're also going to
have a Commission "public meeting" on gas choice and default service that
may or may not lead to some policy change for our gas programs.

You should already be enjoying the Houston summer. The nice part is it
lasts soooooo long.
