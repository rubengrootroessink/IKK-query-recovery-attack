Please see attached research memo that I have received from Bracewell.  I would like to share this with the general counsel of the business group that is doing this transaction.  Which group is that?

Elizabeth - Hope all is well.  Have you come to any conclusions regarding the above referenced proposed power project. As you may recall this project involves US Congressman Grucci, (NY).  His family owns the land that the plant would be developed on.  Whne we last spoke you wanted some time to research whta type, if any disclosure we would have to make regarding this project.  Please page me to discuss further, as it appears that we have an agreement with Grucci's family.  Pager # 888 916-7186, cell phone 973 714-4630.  Thanks SM
