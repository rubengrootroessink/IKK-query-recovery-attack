We need to talk further.  As I discussed yesterday, our concern goes well b=
eyond the limited question of NSR.  I did not even raise a concern about ho=
w this representation might impact the multi-pollutant legislation, althoug=
h I believe Jeff Keeler may have raised this issue in his conversation with=
 Scott.  My concern is that Bracewell's representation of this coalition cr=
eates a real and, at a minimum, practical conflict with Enron's interest in=
 electric transmission access and the full range of topics we have worked o=
n under Enron's retainer.  All of our electric power and, for that matter, =
naural gas legislative and FERC issues are in direct conflict with EEI and =
Southern Co.  I readily foresee a scenario where Enron's issues are in the =
very same legislative negotiations as NSR.  I also am uncomfortable that du=
ring our strategy sessions we constantly discuss global energy (thus enviro=
nmental) strategy in conflict with Southern.  Thus, at present, I do not se=
e how a "Chinese Wall" or any other conflict-related strategy can adequatel=
y protect Enron.  Thanks for looking into this.  Please let me know how we =
should resolve this to everyone's satisfaction.  =20
