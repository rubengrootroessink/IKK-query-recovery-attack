Sue --

Earlier this week, you received an email from the PEP team which included the Performance Evaluations of your employees, both Exempt and Non-Exempt.  Please remember that the final Performance Evaluations should be completed with your employees, forms signed and returned to me at EB1665B no later than Friday, August 17th.  I will be preparing a report for your use noting the final ratings of your Exempt employees from the PRC meetings and distribute that within the next week.

For your Non-Exempt employees, I have listed below all eligible employees for whom you should complete a Performance Evaluation.  However, I need the rating for each employee so it may be input into the PEP system.  The descriptions for Non-Exempt ratings are defined as:

1 - Consistently performs above expectations
2 - Meets expectations
3 - Does not meet expectations

Please indicate the ratings for each of your non-exempt employees below and return to me no later than Wednesday, July 11, 2001.  

NAME		TITLE		SUPERVISOR		DEPARTMENT		HIRE DATE	MY2001 RATING

Perez, Carmen	Sr Admin Asst	Bonnie SUE Nord	Government Affairs	1/16/1987	______________

If you have any questions or need any additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Thanks for your prompt attention to this matter.
