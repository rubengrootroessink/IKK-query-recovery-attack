I will only make this pitch once, but did want to pass along some thoughts =
after reflecting on what I understand to be Jan's rating at yesterday's fun=
ctional PRC.  First, I have no issue with the criticism of his behaviours a=
nd interpersonal skills.  I have sent him several notes of coaching/admonis=
hment when he copied me on e-mails that were too strongly worded.  While so=
me account should be taken of his being "Bavarian", I do not think that is =
an excuse or cover for what is clearly an area for improvement.  Having sai=
d that, I would add the following:

1  This is his first rating with the company, I think.  After the 6-8 month=
s he has just turned in, I think a rating of 4, which is what I understand =
he got, is going to be a bit demoralising.  In additon, people rarely move =
up two notches between periods.  If he is rated a 3, and fixes his behaviou=
rs, there is no doubt he would be a 2 at year-end, if he continued to perfo=
rm substantively as he has.  If he is rated 3 now, and continues to behave =
as he has, he can go down to a 4, and suffer the financial penalties associ=
ated with that.

2  Jan has had a half-year of results that most people hope for. He fixed a=
 number of erroneous license applications initiated by Donald Lassere, and =
in so doing, secured licenses for EBS Europe in Germany, France, Belgium, T=
he Netherlands, and Spain, I think (and I think all or most were from about=
 mid-December onwards). =20

3  BIG WIN:  After much to'ing and fro'ing, Jan (not Tax, not Legal, not ou=
tside counsel, not Accounting) came up with the business structure for trad=
ing bandwidth in the Far East.  The first deal done there, before Jan's app=
roach, required 6 contracts with multiple entities.  It may now seem obviou=
s, but Jan came up with the idea that each of the national telco's trades i=
n its own name, across borders, securing licenses in the name of the same e=
ntity in each country, so why not EBS Asia.  This was a huge breakthrough f=
or EBS Asia.

4  Jan helped secure the Pioneer Tax Status (zero corporate tax for at leas=
t 5 years, maybe ten) in Singapore, thus helping to secure Singapore as our=
 Asian location of choice (as opposed to more expensive Hong Kong), along w=
ith the big success noted in my item 5, below.

5  Jan secured the necessary clarifications on the license fee assessed in =
Singapore to make Singapore our location, and EBS Asia, licensed in Singapo=
re, our vehicle, for Asian bandwidth trading.  There was initially a clear =
and justified concern that we would be charged 1% on gross turnover.  This =
has now been reduced to 1% of the fees associated with Singapore traffic (p=
hysical, not financial) only.  The repeated exchanges between Jan, Tax (Way=
ne Gardner), and Fred Cohagan did get snippy, so I would not be surprised i=
f this elicited bad feedback.  My explanation (not an excuse) is that Jan a=
sked for "final" issues/questions several times, and after each clarificati=
on from Singapore regulator (IDA), he got a barrage of questions internally=
, and had to go back to IDA.  Some of the questions were legitimate, some s=
hould have been thought of earlier, so Jan's frustration was partly underst=
andable, partly not.  Second, I think Jan got all the clarification he coul=
d in a farely opaque regulatory regime (at least on the license fee questio=
n; remember, IDA was not too sure what we were up to, and what they were op=
ining on).  I think Jan, and me, recognised that regulation is not always a=
s transparent in Europe and Asia as in the US.  Conversely, you had a trade=
r (Fred), who I think has not had a big trading responsibility before, and =
he was seeking transparancy that simply was not going to happen.  Jan told =
him so, again, after a few tries, perhaps too abruptly.

6  As a team player, Jan made the effort to support the Asian effort (long,=
 hard travel), including going out to interview the EBS regulatory affairs =
candidates (we ended up with two qualified candidates, even if we have now =
chosen to go with yet another/third candidate).  His willingness to help/be=
 a team player seems completely overlooked in focussing on his other behavi=
ours.

7  Finally, Jan's biggest problem, is also his biggest asset.  There is no =
doubt in my mind that he knows more about the telecomms industry, technical=
ly as well as the substance of regulation, than anyone else in the Company.=
  He does not suffer those who know less than him very easily.  This is wro=
ng, and needs to be addressed, but I am concerned that he is effectively be=
ing taken down two notches for his interpersonal skills.  It seems the mess=
age we are sending is that we are, in effect, valuing good interpersonal sk=
ills over results.  A commercial person who has a big year, but acts out of=
 line (gee, can we think of any?!), would not get a rating below acceptable=
 for being abrasive.  It seems to me too harsh to rate Jan below acceptable=
 for being abrasive, if we also consider his "Bavarian" background, and, as=
 I have shared with Rick, the fact that Jan got a heightened sense of urgen=
cy from Jim Fallon that I think made Jan think his (Jan's) behaviour was ac=
ceptable, if all that mattered was getting results, "yesterday" as Fallon p=
ut it. =20

Enough said.  Thanks for considering my views.   mcs
