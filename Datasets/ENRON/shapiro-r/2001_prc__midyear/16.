Rick - MR brought this deal to EES and has worked hard on navigating it through EES. It looks like a win! Steve

Marchris,
Small note to thank you for your tireless efforts in assisting
Pennzoil-Quaker State Company in their pursuit to have a centralized energy
management program.  The attentiveness and dedication you have shown us has
been instrumental in my staff's education in the complex markets of Natural
Gas and Electricity.

Pennzoil-Quaker State is in the final stages of negotiations with Enron on
managing its energy needs for the state of Texas.  Additionally, we are
waiting on the Enron analysis for the other deregulated state which we have
assets in.  I am very confident that Pennzoil-Quaker State and Enron will
expand its current relation (Jiffy Lube) into a great long term partnership
with Energy Services, Broadband Services, and Media Services.  

Again, thank you for listening to our needs and communicating them to the
appropriate Enron personnel.   

Warm Regards,

Paul Stach
Sr. Strategic Sourcing Manager
