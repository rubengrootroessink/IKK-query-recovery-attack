Dear Rick,

In September, I started a new job with another electric cooperative in North
Alabama near Decatur and Huntsville. It is Joe Wheeler EMC, a TVA
distributor. We have about 39,000 customers in 2 counties south of
Huntsville. This had been a troubled cooperative and had seen a huge
management and board shake-up. I hope that between my efforts and having a
few new board members that things will smooth out here.

I am sure saddened to see all of the stuff hit the fan at Enron. I had
actually bought more stock several weeks ago in the belief that this whole
thing was a fluke. I like many others are reminded that the market is a very
fickle animal indeed. I hope that you and the old group are being seen as
part of the core business. I don't think that anyone would say that ENE did
not have an effective government relations group.

Best Wishes,
George Kitchens
