Rick - I know I don't leave until the end of the week, but I'm feeling cont=
emplative and wanted to take a moment and thank you for all the opportunity=
 and support you have given me over the years.  Although I wish I was leavi=
ng the company better than when I found it, I can't help but feel grateful =
all the same for the experiences and friendships I have made here.  I look =
over the past 3 1/2 years with amazement over the things and people I was e=
xposed to -   the political conventions, the group off-sites, the trip to I=
ndia, the Inauguration (okay, I could have lived without the Inauguration).=
  But all of these things I would never have had a chance to experience wit=
hout Enron and the encouragement of you.  I learned so much here that I wil=
l have to draw upon for the rest of my life.  And the friends I have made a=
nd colleagues I have known have all had a tremendous impact on me.  I have =
never worked in an environment that had such high-quality people.  I owe yo=
u a lot, and I hope you know that no matter how hard things may have gotten=
, or how difficult some decisions may have been for you, you have never let=
 me down and I have always held you in the highest regard.

I have wrapped up about all that I can here and had my exit interview today=
.  I will be taking finals next week and then spend some much needed time w=
ith my family.  But I'm definitely here for you if you need anything, and I=
 am hoping for the best for Enron and its people.

Best Regards, Scott
