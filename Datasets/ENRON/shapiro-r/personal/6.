 Hello, Richard.

Thanks for making Classmates such a success! If you haven't visited us 
recently, please  check out our new Web site, now featuring easier 
navigation, faster download times, and more communication tools. The response 
has been terrific and more people than ever are reconnecting with old 
friends. Last month alone we added more than 1 million new members!

And that's 1 million new reasons to upgrade to a Gold membership! Classmates 
Gold members can directly contact any of our more than 17 million friends, 
including 1765 alumni from Newington. Gold members can send Hi Notes, post 
messages on the Internet's liveliest alumni boards, or strike up a 
conversation in the Newington chat room! To take advantage of all that 
Classmates has to offer,  upgrade your membership now!

Once again, thanks for being part of Classmates.

With kind regards,

The Staff at Classmates
