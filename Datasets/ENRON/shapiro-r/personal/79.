Thank you for the note below. =20

You've taken the brunt of this since the first inkling of bad news.  I unde=
rstand that on the call last Friday, the group thanked you for keeping us a=
ll informed and together.  I wish that I could have been on the call to joi=
n with the rest of the group in expressing those thanks to you.

Enron has been, and for some hopefully will continue to be, a wild ride.  B=
eing part of your group has made the ride really, really, fun and rewarding=
. =20

Beth, Lily and I hope you and your family enjoy the holiday.   We'll be ove=
r the mountains at our house in Black Butte.  We're out of pager range, but=
 the cell phone works fine if you need to reach me re:  anything Dynegy or =
PGE. =20

Take care. =20

Subject:=09American Thanksgiving
Importance:=09High



A few months ago, I sent a note to the North American Government Affairs gr=
oup commemorating a bit of an end point in our efforts relative to Californ=
ia.  In that memo, I included a quote that went as follows ? "What we do in=
 life echoes through eternity".  I think of these words often and believe t=
hem more than ever, particularly after the events, both external and intern=
al to Enron, of the last few months.  I do not know for sure what the next =
few weeks or months will bring for any of us, but I do know that what we've=
 done here at Enron in Government Affairs over the last several years, whet=
her in Houston, Washington, London, Brussels, Sao Paulo, etc. was very good=
 and will be remembered for the positive difference that we have all made i=
n the industries in which we have worked and for each other.  We even had a=
 good time doing it.  The good work we do will go on for many, if not, all =
of us . . . for some, here; for others, elsewhere. =20

Regardless of what the future holds, we should all be quite proud of what w=
e have accomplished here and how it has been accomplished.  My personal app=
reciation for all that you have done as well as at having had the opportuni=
ty to be part of a group that, unfortunately, will be inalterably impacted =
and changed over the next few weeks, is boundless.  Irrespective of where t=
hese changes may take any one of us, I will continue to do all I can to ear=
n your trust and respect. =20

On a more holiday-related note, for those in the U.S., who are working this=
 week, please feel free to leave as early as possible on Wednesday in advan=
ce of Thanksgiving to spend time with your families or loved ones.  For tho=
se not celebrating the American Thanksgiving, you too should try and take s=
ome additional time for yourself and families over the next few days, work =
and business demands permitting.

Thank you.
