Thanks again for taking the time to meet with me today. I enjoyed our visit and remain very interested in the opportunity at El Paso. I believe I can make a difference and build a merchant regulatory function that will add value and be respected in the industry. Feel free to call Steve Kean at 713-853-1586. I'd also be happy to give you some additional names. Thanks again.
