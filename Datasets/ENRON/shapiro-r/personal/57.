Hi Rick,

I'm responding to your very nice voicemail message in writing because I seem to have less control over my emotions these days than I would like.  I cannot tell you how much I appreciate everything you have done for me.  I continue to hold you in the very highest regard professionally and as a friend.  I can honestly say that I have no regrets over the decisions that I have made.  Working with you (and for Enron) has given me opportunities to expand professionally and personally that I never would have had otherwise.  Also, the move to Texas has opened new horizons for my family and taught us that we can be happy in settings very different from what we had known before.

Like you, I wish with all my heart that things had worked out differently.  It would be wonderful to continue to work with you--here or elsewhere.  Whatever comes, I'm greatful for all of the good things that have come my way so far.  Thanks again for everything.  You are an amazing person and an amazing friend.

Sue
