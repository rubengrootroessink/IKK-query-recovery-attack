Thanks a lot Rick. Those words were really encouraging and I hope my survival instincts give me all the courage to face the future !!!. Read your mail on the California Campaign Closeout. Felt very nice on reading it. Gives me a very good feeling for being a part of the team and for being able to contribute in whatever small way I could.

Rick,

Just to keep you informed. The first batch of 23 folks have received severances and the next list is expected around mid- to  end-September. I am still around !!!!! Working with and keeping Amr posted with developments here.

I hope things are going fine in California. Keep on reading the news articles and so feverishly hope a long lasting and mutually beneficial solution would emerge for the Company.

Regards
Ban
