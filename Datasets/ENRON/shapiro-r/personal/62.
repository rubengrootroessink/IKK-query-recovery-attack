Rick:  I don't even know if I can say goodbye to you.  I know you're not supposed to admit these kinds of things, but I'm not sure I can say goodbye without getting emotional.  I truly care about you, and I will watch your back wherever I am.

Lisa

Lisa:Ditto..I'll say my proper goodbyes before the week's out. You're also quite welcome...it's the least I(we) could do.

Rick, et al:

Thank you so much for such a special evening.  I really enjoyed dinner, and the rare occasion to catch up with all of you.  It meant a lot to me that you were willing to give up an evening with your family to wish me well.  

It has truly been a privilege to work with such talented colleagues (as Amr would say).  I will miss working with you, and I will miss your friendship.  

Thanks again.

Lisa
