Rick - Thanks for the note. The reduction in budget to $9.4 million is
indeed dramatic, but appears to be necessary under the circumstances. We
continure to be optimistic also, but I certainly understand the need to be
realistic. Hope you have gotten some rest and I look forward to speaking
with you next week. Ken (P.S. you and Steve Kean and the rest of your
government affairs team can be proud of all you have accomplished in
advocating deregulation in natural gas and power markets in the US and
abroad!)
