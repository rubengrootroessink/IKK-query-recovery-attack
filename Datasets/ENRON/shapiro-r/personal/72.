Hello Rick.  I didn't get a chance to tell you in person - Thank You.  It meant alot to me and I'm sure everyone else on how you handled Enron's "issues" and the Sept. 11th event.  I think this showed to me your true compassion and explains the loyalty that your employees have for you.  

When I grow up, I want to be just like you.  :-)  

Again, Thanks and it was very much appreciated.

Melinda
