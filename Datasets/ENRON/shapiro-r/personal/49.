HI Rick. Hadn't seen this before I talked to you this morning.  I would sen=
d the same message back to you---I and I think many of my colleagues apprec=
iate your support and honesty and loyalty to us as we go along as well.

Have fun with your kids tonight--I am going to a party at my god daughters =
house.  It's been a tradition for about  5 years now---the kids go out in t=
he neighborhood and all of the assorted grandparents/parents/friends have a=
 big chili dinner and drink lots of wine and cider while we wait for them t=
o come back with big candy loot.  It's tons of fun, but everybody ends up w=
ith either a major sugar high or tipsy!
