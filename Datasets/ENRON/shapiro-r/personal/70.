Hi Rick:

Thank you for the kind message that you left on my voicemail on Friday 
evening.  I apologize that I got choked up when I was leaving.  Saying 
goodbye to good friends is not easy.

This is my new personal email address.  Please drop me a line every now and 
then to let me know how you're doing.

I hope to see you soon.

Lisa
