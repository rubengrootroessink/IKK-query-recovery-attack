TRIBUTE TO THE UNITED STATES

This, from a Canadian newspaper, is worth sharing. America: The Good 
Neighbor.  

Widespread but only partial news coverage was given recently to a remarkable 
editorial broadcast from Toronto by Gordon Sinclair, a Canadian television 
commentator. What follows is the full text of his trenchant remarks as 
printed in the Congressional Record.

The comments at the end are not mine but I agree with them wholeheartedly.

"This Canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the Americans as the most 
generous and possibly the least appreciated people on all the earth.  

Germany, Japan and, to a lesser extent, Britain and Italy were lifted out of 
the debris of war by the Americans who poured in billions of dollars and 
forgave other billions in debts. None of these countries is today paying even 
the interest on its remaining debts to the United States.

When France was in danger of collapsing in 1956, it was the Americans who 
propped it up, and their reward was to be insulted and swindled on the 
streets of Paris. I was there. I saw it.

When earthquakes hit distant cities, it is the United States that hurries in 
to help.

This spring, 59 American communities were flattened by tornadoes. Nobody 
helped.

The Marshall Plan and the Truman Policy pumped billions of dollars into 
discouraged countries. Now newspapers in those countries are writing about 
the decadent, warmongering Americans. I'd like to see just one of those 
countries that is gloating over the erosion of the United States dollar build 
its own airplane. Does any other country in the world have a plane to equal 
the Boeing Jumbo Jet, the Lockheed Tri-Star, or the Douglas DC10? If so, why 
don't they fly them?  Why do all the International lines except Russia fly 
American Planes? 

Why does no other land on earth even consider putting a man or woman on the 
moon?

You talk about Japanese technocracy, and you get radios.

You talk about German technocracy, and you get automobiles. 

You talk about American technocracy, and you find men on the moon - not once, 
but several times - and safely home again. 

You talk about scandals, and the Americans put theirs right in the store 
window for everybody to look at.  Even their draft-dodgers are not pursued 
and hounded. They are here on our streets, and most of them, unless they are 
breaking Canadian laws, are getting America dollars from ma and pa at home to 
spend here. 

When the railways of France, Germany and India were breaking down through 
age, it was the Americans who rebuilt them. When the Pennsylvania Railroad 
and the New York Central went broke, nobody loaned them an old caboose. Both 
are still broke.

I can name you 5000 times when the Americans raced to the help of other 
people in trouble. Can you name me even one time when someone else raced to 
the Americans in trouble? I don't think there was outside help even during 
the San Francisco earthquake. 

Our neighbors have faced it alone, and I'm one Canadian who is damned tired 
of hearing them get kicked around.

They will come out of this thing with their flag high. And when they do, they 
are entitled to thumb their nose at the lands that are gloating over their 
present troubles. I hope Canada is not one of those. 

Stand proud, America! Wear it proudly!!"

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
This is one of the best editorials that I have ever read regarding the United 
States. It is nice that one man realizes it. I only wish that the rest of the 
world would realize it. We are always blamed for everything, and never even 
get a thank you for the things we do. I would hope that each of you would 
send this to as many people as you can and  emphasize that they should send 
it to as many of their friends until this letter is sent to every person on 
the web. I am just a single American that has read this, I SURE HOPE THAT A 
LOT MORE READ IT SOON.
