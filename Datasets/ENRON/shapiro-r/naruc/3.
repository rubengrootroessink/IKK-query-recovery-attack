Dear Interested Parties: 

Please find attached the final draft of NARUC's National Electricity Policy. We are providing you with this document as a courtesy. Our goal is to
review and debate the policy at the NARUC Annual Meeting in Philadelphia and to approve a policy that provides members of Congress and other federal policy makers a summary of NARUC's position on federal energy policy and legislation. We look forward to a lively debate in Philadelphia. 

Sincerely, 
Judy Jones, Co-chair 
Edward Garvey, Co-chair 
NARUC's National Energy Policy Committee
