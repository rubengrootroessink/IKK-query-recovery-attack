Rick, I want to compliment you on this well-written and information-packed 
announcement.  It's got to make employees in your group feel proud to be on 
your team.  It's also the kind of message (friendly, congratulatory, 
celebratory) that would make anyone feel good about working here.  Others 
should follow your example. 

Mary
