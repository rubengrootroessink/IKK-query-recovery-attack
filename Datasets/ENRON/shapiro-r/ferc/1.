It has been announced among the staff at FERC that Nora Brownell has chosen some of her personal office staff.

Jamie Simler - has electric, gas and oil background at OMTR (as well as, she is expected to be an technical advisor on electric matters
Mary Morton - has been working most recently on Calif. electric matters in OGC, she is expected to be a legal advisor on electric matters.

Those are the two announced staff but there is strong rumor that Jim Petersen will be the third member of Commissioner Brownell's staff.  His background is mostly gas rates in OMTR, but he is also an attorney.

Lisa Yoho has told me that the staff will not be specifically assigned to electric or gas, but rather will divide work by cases.

No more news on Chairman Woods' specific office staff.  Of course, he has already been joined by Allison Silverstein from Texas and she is acting as a chief of staff.
