When he took on Stand Up for Steel as a client, he checked with us.  We gave 
him a client waiver.

Administration's Stance On Steel Imports Seen As Protectionist.  The Wall 
Street Journal (6/7, Phillips, Wonacott) reports, "For all his talk about 
free trade, President Bush's step toward blocking some steel imports signals 
that the Republicans will be every bit as protectionist as the Democrats, 
trade analysts said.  U.S. Trade Rep. Robert Zoellick, usually a classic 
free-trader, said Wednesday -- while in China preaching the benefits of 
opening markets -- that foreign steelmakers were selling their products below 
cost to gain market share in the U.S.  The administration, nonetheless, acted 
under a trade law that doesn't require it to prove such dumping took place.'  
At a time of economic slowdown in all our countries, there are going to be 
increasing pressures' for protectionism, Mr. Zoellick acknowledged.  In 
keeping with World Trade Organization rules, he said, 'the U.S. will act to 
safeguard and protect its own economic interests.'"  The Journal adds that 
"trade analysts and foreign steel producers said the decision proves that 
domestic politics always trumps free-market philosophy." 
 
       Steel State Senators Pleased By Bush Action.  The Charleston Daily 
Mail (6/7, Fischer) reports, "In pressing for an investigation that could 
result in restrictions in steel imports, President George Bush kept a 
campaign promise but could curiously counter his reputation as a free trader 
just as he prepares his first trip to Europe."  The Daily Mail adds, "A group 
of steel-state senators were pleased Tuesday afternoon, but quickly and 
soberly acknowledged that initiation of the trade case is only the 
beginning."  The senators included Jay Rockefeller, Arlen Specter, and Robert 
Byrd. 

       Gillespie, Weber Lobbying Seen As Key To US Steel Companies' Victory.  
The Washington Post (6/7, E1, Edsall, Blustein) Reports, "In persuading 
President Bush, a self-proclaimed free trader, to take steps this week aimed 
at restricting imports of steel, lobbyists for the U.S. steel industry used 
the threat that thousands of retired steelworkers in key states would lose 
their health insurance if their companies closed.  The specter of an uprising 
by steel retirees, who substantially outnumber active steelworkers, provided 
a potent political argument for the industry's case that Bush should take 
drastic action to protect U.S. steel companies from a worldwide glut even at 
the cost of tarnishing his free-trade image.  The argument was advanced by 
two top Republican lobbyists, Edward W. Gillespie and Vin Weber, each of whom 
has been receiving $45,000 a month from an industry-union coalition called 
Stand Up for Steel.  The coalition scored a smashing victory Tuesday, when 
Bush announced that his administration will file a case with the U.S. 
International Trade Commission seeking to win authority to set quotas on 
steel imports.  And although many factors went into the White House's 
decision, industry sources and other participants pointed to the concerns 
raised by Gillespie and Weber as a classic demonstration of how a highly 
motivated constituency can sway an administration that barely won the 
electoral college and lost the popular vote."
