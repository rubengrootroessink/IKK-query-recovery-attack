Rick - FYI.  I wanted you to know that we're working with the London EIM team 
to provide information on regulatory / trade issues.   Thanks.

Masha, 

I hope the meetings in DC went well.  As we briefly discussed, I am a member 
of the EIM team here in Europe.  Although the group size is up to about 30 
now, we are still trying to develop the infrastructure, including those who 
deal specifically with regulatory requirements.  Consequently, I have been 
referred to you.  However, if there is someone else with whom I should speak, 
please let me know and I will be happy to do so.

Given that you and Lisa are probably the best suited to help us, I will 
outline for you what information/ analysis we are looking to find.  
Basically, we would greatly appreciate a similar profile/ excel sheets on 
anti-dumping, country profiles and countervailing and antidumping targets 
(country and producers) that you provided for the US team (see attached)


 - margins.xls, Anti dumping into Europe   - STEEL PROFILES.doc    - 
Hot-Rolled Memo.doc


We would be looking at these components as they relate to Europe 
(particularly the EU 15).  However, as major trade flows are intra EU 15 
south to north (particular focus on Spain, Italy, Germany, France and UK) AND 
other Europe and CIS to EU 15 and the rest of the world, the relationship of 
nations such as Turkey, Russia, Ukraine, Bulgaria, etc. are  very important.

As we try to piece together and execute a strategy for steel transactions in 
Europe, any insight your team can provide would be greatly appreciated.  
Please feel free to give me a call and we can discuss this in greater 
detail.  Thank you in advance for your help.

Kind Regards,
