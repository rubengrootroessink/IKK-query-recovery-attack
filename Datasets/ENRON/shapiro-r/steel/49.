ITC today published a schedule of hearings on the injury phase of section 201 investigation.  Five public hearings were scheduled in Washington, DC, and one additional hearing will be conducted in Merillville, Indiana, located south of Gary.  The field hearing will address general conditions in the domestic steel industry and is likely to attract a lot of union labor.  The DC hearings will focus on the broad product categories with 45 minutes allotted to each specific product group (e.g., hot-rolled sheet, strip, and coils).

The schedule of the hearings is the following:

?	September 20 - carbon and alloy flat products; Washington, DC
?	September 24 - carbon and alloy long products and stainless and tool products, Washington, DC
?	September 25 - carbon and alloy long product and stainless and tool products, Washington, DC
?	September 28 - stainless and tool products, Washington, DC
?	October 1 - carbon and alloy tubular products, Washington, DC
?	October 5 - general hearing in Merillville, Indiana 

Despite the requests by Canadian and Mexican embassies to conduct a separate hearing on imports from NAFTA, the Commission declined the request for a separate hearing.  Both Canadians and Mexicans are concerned that NAFTA issues will be buried in the general injury testimonies as Canadian producers, for example, would have to testify in hearings for 22 product categories.

If you have any additional questions, please let me know.
