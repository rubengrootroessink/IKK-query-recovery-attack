I've attached a summary of recently proposed NETA modifications.  The BSC 
Panel has recommended the Authority reject Mod P9.  The other mods will be 
considered by the BSC Panel for the first time on May 31st, a meeting which 
Paul and I will attend.  Proposed mods normally then go through a 
consultation and assessment/reporting phase before a decision is made.

Enron has an opinion on three of the mods: P12 (oppose), P15 (support with 
modified timing) and P18 (support option 1).  Elexon recommends P15 and P18 
be treated as urgent, which means the consultation and decision process will 
progress very rapidly.

Regards
Nick
