Pat Wood may be at FERC in about three weeks.  He will be in Washington next 
week and confirmation may take place two to three weeks from today. 

At the PUCT - still no selection of commissioners - at the top of list is 
Steve Barron from the Attorney General's office. (Pat Wood thinks he will be 
a good commissioner.) 

Gov. Perry's appointment person, Dealy Herndon, is pushing Suzie McClellan.  
Suzie has been at OPUC for the last couple of years.  She has never been 
pro-competition (quite the contrary).  However, she is the daughter-in-law of 
Carol Keeton- Rylander. I heard Gov. Perry and other have rejected her, but 
Dealy keeps pushing.  I don't think she will make it.

Gov. Perry wants to select someone he personally knows and trusts, that also 
has experience.  He has rejected the "short list" a couple of times.  Diana 
Liebman is still in the running.  Although many have said that Stephanie 
Kroger is conflicted out, I heard she may still be considered (Pat Wood 
really likes her).  Other names floating around include Julie Parsley and 
Scott Sherman.
