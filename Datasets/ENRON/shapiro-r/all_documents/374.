		 Subject: Market Opening Position 

Eric, we are pretty sure the announcement will be that they will open the 
market by May 2002.  Today, senior political and bureaucratic staff in the 
Ministry of Energy have gone out of their way to stress that the announcement 
is designed to leave open the  real possibility of an earlier opening (i.e. 
in November 2001) if that is feasible.   As matters stand, I think that our 
response should be: a) We are pleased by the reaffirmation of the gov'ts 
intention to move forward with competition in the Ontario power market; b) 
our understanding of the position is that it leaves open the  real 
possibility of opening the market earlier, such as of November 1, 2001;  c) 
we continue to believe that an opening in November  2001 is feasible and in 
the best interests of Ontario (for the reasons set forth in Ken Lay's speech) 
; and  d) accordingly, we will continue to work towards a November opening 
and we encourage all others in the market  to do the 
same.                      Peter Varley of GPC is going to give you a call.
