Yes.  We talked this morning, and I am pleased with the results.  We talked 
about integrating our offices fully.  We agreed that I would put together an 
office seat assignment chart, which would move John and his folks into our 
section of the office.  This will allow  us to more fully integrate our 
activities on a daily if not hourly means.  We also talked about how John and 
Tom should think about our involvement on international issues.  Our basic 
framework, which will need further definition, is to consolidate Joe Hillings 
activities into John's  and Tom's portfolios.  By that I see John handling 
project based activity and Tom predominantly handling international 
legislative issues.  There will of course be overlap but I think the friction 
we have seen in the office to date should be mitigated with this approach.  
Tom has a very full plate, and even with our new hires, I do not see Tom's 
domestic (such as energy and commodities) activities dropping off that much.  
This too should lessen friction.  John and I also talked about consolidating 
our budgets.  I explained to him how that has worked to date with Joe 
Hartsoe's group.  John and I also discussed our outside counsel in the 
international arena, including McLarty.  John thought Mac could be very 
helpful to us and that we can better focus Mac's assignments.   We also 
discussed that I planned to end or multilaterize the Hills Co. engagement at 
the end of March.  I am prepared to recommend that we either terminate the 
engagement or ask other members of the coaltion to pay an equal share of the 
cost, thus potentially our cost to a $2/3K level per month from its current 
level of $20K.  I doubt members will be willing to give up their free ride, 
so my guess is that we will be terminating the contract.

Ginger --

I checked with Helen Rizzo this morning and she said there has been no final 
word about their status.
I would suggest that Rick and/or other principals discuss and get back to 
John Hardy -- when and if they make a decision
about incorporating that group into Federal Government Affairs.

That's all I know!

Best.

Lora
