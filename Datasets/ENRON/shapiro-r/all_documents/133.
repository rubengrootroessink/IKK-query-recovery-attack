Rick - 

I wasn't sure if you wanted to discuss 2000 budget in tomorrow's meeting but 
I wanted to give you some information on how the cost centers are doing as of 
the end of November:

Cost Center Number - Name - Owner	Year to Date Available
100042 - Enron Wash - Robertson	1,034,272.38
100059 - Fed Reg Affairs - Hartsoe	(40,965.92)
100062 - Dir Govt Affairs - Shapiro	4,427,058.18
100072 - ST G Aff-TX/OkAr - Ryall	(36,951.75)
100085 - St Gv Aff-Cal - Kaufman	(553.90)
100086 - St Gv Aff-Can - Dadson	239,757.92
100087 - St G Af-Md Atl - Montovano	(153,952.78)
100088 - St Gv Aff-MW - Migden	(107,315.96)
100100 - Gvt. Aff-Mex - Charvel	115,083.49
100108 - Reg Env/Implmnt - Steffes	84,032.05
TOTAL =	5,560,463.71

Beginning in January appropriate costs should be charged to the new cost 
centers for Sue Nord, Harry Kingerski and Lisa Yoho.  I'm working on putting 
together a variance report which I will forward to you for your review and 
comment.  With your permission I will work with Ginger to send out an e-mail 
to the assistants letting them know how things should be coded for 2001.  I 
assume that for 2001 the cost center owners will need to report monthly if 
they are over year to date.

Eric
