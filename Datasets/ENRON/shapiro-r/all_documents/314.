Sorry you didn't get this yesterday.  Can you have Ginger fax me a final copy 
of the letter for safekeeping.

Chris,

I think the letter looks fine.  I just made some very minor typo/cosmetic 
changes.  I guess the biggest remaining issue is the identity of the 
addressee?  To whom should Ken send this letter?

Thanks,
Mark

After a thorough internal review of Jim Doty's nomination, there seems to be 
unanimous support for the nomination of Jim Doty.  This has been confirmed 
after receiving input from Enron management in legal, commercial, and 
government affairs. 

One concern was that a future PGE sale would be in some way be impacted if 
Jim Doty were to recuse himself given his relationship with Enron. All agree 
he would recuse himself, which we knew when he was retained, and that the 
impact would be minimal.  Another concern, was the Washington media reported 
that Doty had in some way alienated Sen. or Mrs. Gramm, it was reported back 
to me that is not the case and the Gramm's do not oppose the Doty nomination.

The SEC nomination process is still moving rather slow and that no candidate 
has pulled in front, according to our DC consultants. 

The letter states Enron's broad support for Doty's nomination. It does not 
advocate any particular policy position or issue.
