Caroline -- Thanks for your help.  I would like to get the ball rolling with 
Asia Partnership asap Tuesday morning.  Perhaps you and I could talk this 
afternoon so I can provide you with additional details regarding the 
parameters of the search.  I am in the Singapore office (numbers listed 
below) -- please give me a call when you have a minute.  Thanks.

Anthony,
I will be contacting Asia Partnership regarding Regulatory Recruiting for EBS 
in Singapore on Tuesday when they return from Easter holiday.  As I 
understand from Nick, you have two finalist candidates but would like to see 
if AP can produce anyone quickly for you.  Asia Partnership will most likely 
ask you for a retainer for this search (30 - 40% of total expected fee), but 
I will find out how soon they would expect to have candidates ready for 
interview before I tell them that we're 100% interested in moving forward.  
Lilian/Chor Lim, 
I'm going to hand this over to you to manage with Lucy Marshall of AP once I 
speak with her next week.  Lets plan on introduction via telephone Tuesday or 
Wednesday depending on how quickly they can produce for us.  I'm working to 
negotiate a preferred provider agreement, but have not yet managed to get any 
fee discounts.
Thanks,
Caroline
