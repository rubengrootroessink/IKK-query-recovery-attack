Rick,

Unfortunately, contrary to the performance management system's reply (see 
below), performance reviews are not confidential in the DC office as the 
office manager has access to the passwords of some of the Vice Presidents.  

I would like to comply with your request to give a performance review for 
Cynthia Sandherr, but unless I can send it to you in a confidential envelope 
I have no guarantee it will not be seen at some point by my colleagues.  
(Your are listed as her supervisor according to the PEP system.)  This poses 
a problem for me.

Your advice is welcome.

The review will have to be done on the system, it will however remail 
confidential.
