Rick - Here is a final copy of the NJN LOI  that was executed ie fuel cells.  
I'm excited about this because although NJN is a smaller LDC , this deal was 
cut at the highest levels (Pres/CFO) of their organization and has solidified 
an already solid regulatory relationship.  Larry Downes has all but assured 
me that  the gas asset deal is next!   Hope all is well.  See u Thursday.

Great trip back.  I spent yesterday in Clarksdale Mississippi.  Don't make a 
point of spending your vacation there!

Can you email me Glenn's info so I can send him the hard copy?

I enjoyed our time together, and look forward to more adventures.

Kay
