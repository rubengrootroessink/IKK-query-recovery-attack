Rick:

I have a large set of comments on the full paper from Christi Nicollay (who
has been corrdinating this), plus the others. We will make changes as
appropriate. Sabine and I have also started a bit on the shorter version
just so we will be ready ont hat front.

At some point I guess we still need to have the conversation with Steve
(Maureen is trying to get a new date). From my perspective it would also be
useful if you and I could have a quick chat sometime. Otherwise I think we
risk losing the plot due to the elapsed time.

I will be in Toronto and DC for much of the week but you can try me on my
cellphone number (617) 513-5904.
