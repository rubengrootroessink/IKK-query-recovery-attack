		 Subject: Ken Lay/John Lavorato Briefing Material

 I have attached the following: a) a high level outline of the speaking 
points for Ken Lay and John Lavorato for their meetings with Premier Harris 
and, I hope, Wilson, Purchase and Hubert;  and  b) a more detailed briefing 
note which outlines:   i) key developments since April 4 ,   ii) our position 
re market opening and the key issues that have been raised against opening 
the market this Fall, iii) differences between California and Ontario; and 
iv) Enron's assessment of the possible difficulties in NYC this Summer.  I am 
awaiting material from Houston to complete the piece on 
NYC.                         One piece that I think needs to be added to the 
detailed briefing note is an overview of Enron's current commercial position 
in Ontario - i.e. the renegotiation of the BE contract and the likelihood of 
pursuing a retail initiative.  You will see where I have left space for that 
piece, hoping that you could draft it.                     I have endeavoured 
in the outline of the speaking points to focus on what we know the key 
issues/concerns for  the government are at this stage.                      I 
have asked Sasha Jacob to provide us with profiles of Harris, Wilson, 
Purchase and Hubert to include in the final briefing package.                 
       I have prepared the material on the assumption that the best use of 
the meeting time (likely 45 minutes with Harris and 60 minutes with Wilson et 
al)  is: a)  to make  the  case for proceeding with market opening this Fall 
if the IMO and OEB reports re market readiness are positive;  b) to provide 
Harris et al with our perspective on developments in the U.S. (particularly 
New York and California) about which the government may have continuing 
concerns; and c) to ask Harris what we can do to help the gov't move forward 
to a market opening this year.                              Rick Shapiro left 
me a voice mail indicating that Lavorato and he had spoken about the visit 
and the supporting material. The agreement  between the two of them is 
evidently  that  Rob, you and I are  all to be comfortable with the briefing 
material before sending it to John, who will then review it and propose any 
changes he feels are necessary before it is forwarded to Ken 
Lay.                                 I would appreciate your questions, 
comments and suggested revisions.
