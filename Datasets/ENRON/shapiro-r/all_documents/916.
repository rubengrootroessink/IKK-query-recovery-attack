Why don't I send it out to all of the group for East and West.  I don't think 
we need to discuss East or West group leads since that may be switching 
around once we hire a new person for the NE.  In addition, I think this 
appropriately emphasizes that everyone needs to be coordinating with all 
others, rather than placing that on a group lead.  If you agree, I'll send it 
out today.

Here are my thoughts.  Should this come from you or me?  Do we want to 
highlight Steve Walton and Ron M?  Should this be East only?  Pls respond.
