FYI.  While Steve got it wrong, I think that it doesn't hurt for Sarah and 
Linda to know Dan Clearfield.  He was the attorney that helped negotiate the 
PA settlements.

Jim, Steve Huntoon indicated that you are now in charge of federal lobbying 
(lucky you!)  I wanted to touch base and see if you thought that I might be 
of some service in light of Nora ascension.  One idea I had is some task 
force or other group (funded primarily by Enron) in support of state market 
opening steps.  The purpose of the task force is to push the FERC to take 
actions that help the states to continue to move to open markets and/or to 
oppose steps that aren't pro-competition.  I don't know whether this idea has 
any legs or not.  Or, perhaps we could participate on behalf of Enron at FERC 
on specific issues that fall into this category.  Just a thought. Hope all is 
well with you and your family.
