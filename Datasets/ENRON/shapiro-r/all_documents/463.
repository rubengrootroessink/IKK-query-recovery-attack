Rick,

Jackie Gentle has asked me to investigate the costs for subscriptions to some 
of our most relevant European trade journals for you. I have listed below the 
costs for on-line or hard copy subscriptions (this should include postage to 
the USA) and I have also included details of how to subscribe.
Jackie also wanted me to remind you of the site details for FT Energy Online:

Please let me know if you would like any further information.

Thanks
Iona
