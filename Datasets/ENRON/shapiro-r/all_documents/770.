Hi Rick,

As you can see, I'm not really the one driving this process.  What do I need 
to do to coordinate with the hiring committee?

Sue and Marla

Anthony Duenner, Fred Cohagan and the EBS team in Singapore have interviewed 
this candidate , Maurice Nunas/ Motorola and found him suitable. We  would 
like to have both of you interview him on 29 May 8pm Houston time. (Sue, I 
believe Anthony's secretary, Apple has already sent you an email on this too).

I have attached Maurice's resume for your review. I would be grateful if both 
of you could interview together so that we could proceed to work on 
remuneration package if you are OK with him. Given his current remuneration, 
we are looking in bring him in at Senior Director level.

Pls feel free to call me at my cellphone 65-967 888 42 if you have any 
questions.

regards,
chor-lim
