Rick requested I send notice that budget savings submitted for consideration 
have been approved.  Rick advised that dollars relating to RCR or 
discretionary funds were not considered.

It is my understanding that Rick will be discussing the total cost savings 
and its impact at the next direct reports meeting scheduled for this Thursday.

The policy regarding travel and cell phone use will be distributed to all G/A 
employees later this week.

Please advise of any questions, comments or concerns.

Eric
