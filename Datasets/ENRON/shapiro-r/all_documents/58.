Dan:  Tom Briggs and I wanted to work with you to get the document in a more 
"Hill" friendly style.  For us to use it on the Hill, some of the legal ease 
needs to be further refined.  We think the document is almost there....I 
thought Tom had shared some of his comments with Sarah yesterday.  ....This 
is why I've been calling you but understand why you and I have been missing 
each other's phone calls.  Tom is out of the office today so perhaps we can 
all talk tomorrow.  What are you hearing from Linda Stuntz?  The bill 
currently is not gaining traction on the Hill.  You saw where Chairman Barton 
(per my conversation with him) gave the press the story of his continued 
opposition to a stand-alone reliability bill.

Is the written opposition that I prepared being used?  Is there anything more 
that you need from me, Cynthia?

We need to be doing everything we can to make sure this doesn't pass this
Congress.

been asked to pass the attached information on to the MAPP members and
