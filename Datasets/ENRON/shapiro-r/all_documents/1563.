As folks know, I am sending our suggested legislative language to DOE this 
afternoon,  The package you were asked to review contained legislative 
language making RTO participation mandatory.  After further discussions with 
Tom Briggs, I am not sending the mandatory RTO language as a part of our 
package.  My concern with sending it as legislative language is that this 
would muddy the waters on our open access rulemaking (a draft of which we are 
getting this Friday from Watkiss and which we plan to transmit to DOE next 
week).  FERC has existing authority to make RTO participation mandatory.  
Thus, instead of fighting out the issue in the legislative sphere, we should 
reserve it for a possible rulemaking in open access.  We decided not to two 
track open access, so I don't think we want to two track mandatory RTOs.  If 
anyone disagrees with this strategy, we can send it first thing Thursday in 
legislative form to DOE.

Mr. Kean, 

Please review the final versions of the attached documents and make any 
comments directly to Linda,  ASAP.  Please note that we are revising the 
interconnect language. Donna Bobbish at V&E will soon submit the changes.
