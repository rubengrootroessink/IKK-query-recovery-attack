Sergio:

Attached are a few documents that set out Enron's position on governance 
issues.  Each document is somewhat case specific (eg. GridFlorida focuses on 
the governance problems in  Florida, etc) but you will see our general 
position from each document.  As you will see in the GridFlorida pleading, we 
urge FERC to order Florida to implement a governance structure similar to 
that in PJM, which has worked quite well over the past couple of years.  In 
the California White Paper, we focus on the problems with the stakeholder 
board which has since been disbanded and replaced with a board chosen by the 
California government.  In the last California protest, we focus on the 
problems with the California government putting in their own board.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if you need other documents.

Sarah
