> Dems Ask Burton To Investigate Cheney's Energy Task Force
>    House Government Reform Committee Democrats Tuesday wrote
> Government Reform Chairman Burton to urge him to look into Vice
> President Cheney's energy task force, which met privately with
> major Republican donors in formulating the Bush administration's
> energy policy, the Associated Press reported. Government Reform
> ranking member Henry Waxman, D-Calif., asked Burton to conduct a
> hearing on what took place at the Cheney group's secret meetings
> and the identities of all participants. "The Cheney task force
> has conducted its meetings in private, and reportedly has
> obtained input from private citizens and groups, including
> political contributors," Waxman wrote in the letter. The AP
> reported last month that GOP contributors - including executives
> from power wholesaler Enron and the Edison Electric Institute,
> the utility industry lobbying group - had met with Cheney to
> discuss energy policy. A committee spokesman said the Republican
> staff has not had a chance to discuss the letter with Burton.
