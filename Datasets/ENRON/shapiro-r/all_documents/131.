Cynthia:

Here's a memo Scott Bolton put together which reflects his thoughts on a 
broad EBS Washington strategy for next year.  I commented on it before it 
went out.  It's still a work in progress.

Item 3 in particular might be of interest tomorrow when you participate in 
Pres-elect Bush's Commerce Department transition team meeting.  

We would propose consolidating the funding of high-cost telecommunications 
infrastructure within NTIA at Commerce.  This idea was floated a few weeks 
ago by industry, but received luke warm support.  It would serve our 
interests well in moving toward a coordinated federal broadband strategy, 
which we could more effectively target and influence.

Thanks, and good luck.

Steve
