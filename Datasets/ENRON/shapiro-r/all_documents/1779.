Tks for the interest. Here it goes.

As I said, this is an interesting and important case study to follow. I 
personally do not believe that the association of distributors is going to 
strongly stand against this decline in Initial Contracts. Afterall, there are 
a monopsony for this "cheap" energy, totally creating a non level playing 
field after 2003.  Please keep in mind that 2003 is one of our hopes to have 
a decent business in Brazil.

Some good news. Kish is getting more involved. Orlando more confident to 
express our (Enron's views).
Those letters are just the tip of the iceberg, though.

Another  good subject for us to follow up closely is the Bill of Law 2905. It 
proposes several changes to the electric sector. Inter alia, there is a 
proposal to keep bulk energy prices regulated after 2003, when the initial 
contracts start expiring. This is detrimental to Enron as it t will delay the 
implementation of a real wholesale market. Keeping most of the energy 
regulated will certainly have spillover effects on the unregulated business. 
We have already discussed this subject internally. We all agree that this 
proposal is bad for Enron. However, it may be good for Abradee, as the 
distribution companies will be the only buyers of the cheap, regulated energy 
after 2003. Needless to say, they will likely support it.

Some of our collegues are anxious and screaming that Enron should put a stick 
on the ground. Right before I left, I prepared a simple "white paper" to us 
to use internally and externally. It shows that maintaining energy regulated 
is bad for competition and for expansion. Enron has been silent on this 
issue.  If necessary, I can get this translated, It is really important. My 
concern is that Enron will try to look for consensus and we will not be as 
assertive as we should.



You may want to probe this issue with our top managers in South America,  at 
some points in the future.

We already have another letter about "A" consumers. I believe that we'd 
better have each subject in a different letter. 
The letter about "A" consumers is attached. I have not recieved feedbacks on 
it.

My "two cents":

I would add Remi's concepts to the bottom of Fred's letter.  We shold say 
something like we believe in the "A" market and applaud the governments 
efforts to date, but we remain frustrated by what we view as unnecessary 
restrictions on purchase and sale of certificates.  We shold then list the 
changes we would make.

Then we should go on to state that we are puzzled as to the difference 
between energy represented by certificates and energy produced by 
Eletrobolt.  After all, an electron is an electron.  Why not collapse the 
markets together?  Certifcates can settle at the MAE and merchant plants can 
sell industrials the power they need above their meta on bilateral basis.

Starting with Eletrobolt, adding "A" market, and poining out how similar they 
truly are produces what I think is a great flow and a great argument.

Thanks,

Kish
