Dear Mr Shapiro 

I'm e-mailing you at the suggestion of Paul Dawson in London. My colleague 
Ian Fletcher has discussed with Mark Schroeder and Paul the possibility of 
arranging a secondment to Enron from my current post at the UK Government's 
Department of Trade & Industry (DTI). 

I am hoping to arrange a suitable posting to start late September 2001 and to 
last around two years. I would optimally like to be based in or around Los 
Angeles (so that I can live with my wife who will be in LA for the next two 
years) but understand that for Enron San Francisco is likely to be the 
closest location with any openings.

I attach a copy of my CV which outlines my experience, skills and 
achievements to date. You will see that I have already established a 
successful and varied career in the public sector - most recently in the 
energy sector. At this point I am looking for an opportunity to acquire real 
commercial experience using the skills I've already proved, whilst building 
up new ones. 

My colleague Maureen Verrall +44 (0) 20 7215 8022 manages the DTI's 
secondment team and would be able to talk through the practical and financial 
details.

Would it be possible for us to have a phone conversation at some point in the 
next few days? My direct office number is +44 (0) 20 7215 0237 or I could 
call you if that would be more convenient.

Yours sincerely, 

Edward Barker
