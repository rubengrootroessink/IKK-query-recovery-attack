The Honorable Orrin G. Hatch
Chairman, Trade Subcommittee
Finance Committee
United States Senate
Washington, DC 20510

Dear Senator Hatch:

President Bush has asked me to respond to your recent letter regarding the
troubling developments in the U.S. steel industry. The Administration is
very concerned about the issues you have raised.

This Administration is committed to the swift and strong enforcement of the
trade laws. There are currently more than 150 anti-dumping and
countervailing duty actions in effect or under investigation relating to
steel products. In addition, the steel industry is currently receiving
import relief under Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 for line pipe and
steel wire rod products.

However, despite the measures that are currently in place, we continue to be
concerned about the health of the steel industry. I and other senior
Administration officials have begun meeting with representatives of the
steel industry to determine what additional actions are needed. We are
carefully considering all options, including further action under Section
201 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended.

We will continue to monitor conditions in the industry and will take
additional actions as needed to strengthen the future for U.S. steel
workers, their employers and our nation's economy.

Sincerely,

Robert B. Zoellick
