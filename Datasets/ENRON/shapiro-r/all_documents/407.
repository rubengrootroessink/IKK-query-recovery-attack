Rick --

Amr makes some good points.  Specifically, I think that having Amr report t=
o=20
you directly would allow his "audit" function to receive the necessary=20
independence and support.  More importantly, I think that you could use Amr=
=20
as a "test" whenever confronted with large differences.  Finally, his=20
reporting to you gives you a very valuable resource to use as you see fit=
=20
across the organization.

Let's talk.
