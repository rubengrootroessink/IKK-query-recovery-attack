This transaction was a real pleasure to work on.  It is a 12 month 
all-requirements contract with Central Maine Power Company for their 
medium-sized commercial customers.

Once again the model of a cross-functional team was successfully employed.  
John Llodra was the lead originator with support from George Wood 
(mid-market), Janice Moore (legal) and myself.  The four of us participated 
in numerous meetings with both the counterparty and with the regulatory 
commission overseeing the procurement process with the ultimate result of 
having our contract approved and executed the same day.  I am told the deal 
booked $10m for ENA.

Subject: Congrats!

Contratulations on the execution of the Central Maine SOS deal! This is 
another great example of what we can do when everyone comes together to get 
something done. This transaction brings both strategic value to the business, 
nice positions for the book and quite a nice chunk of change as well! 

Great job guys!

(Hey Dana, are you paying for the celebration dinner?!)
