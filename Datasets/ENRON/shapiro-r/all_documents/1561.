Rick, just giving myself a pat on the back for convincing FERC staff to 
release all of our wind generation projects from the FERC reporting 
requirements relating to monitoring of CA plant outages.  Regards,  Ray

I think this e-mail from FERC staff finalizes the matter, and we need not 
report the information sought in the FERC letters of May 1 and May 18 for the 
Green Power Project or any of our other wind power projects.  I would advise 
that we all keep a record of these e-mail exchanges, in the event a question 
ever arises.  Regards,  Ray

Dear Mr. Alvarez:
 
I apologize for not getting back to you sooner.  Enron does not have to 
report outages for its Green Power Project because it is a small wind unit.  
 
Sincerely,

Dear Mr. Fischer:

The Green Power Project is 16.5 mW. Enron Wind Corp. never shuts this plant
off; wind turbines are maintained individually. The plant has a 95%
availability, which means that only 5% of the turbines should be off line
for maintenance at any given time.

Very truly yours,

Enron Power Marketing, Inc.

Dear Mr. Fischer:

This letter is written to summarize our telephone conversation this
afternoon regarding the captioned matter, and with reference to the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission's letter dated May 18, 2001, sent under your
signature to Enron Power Marketing, Inc.  I am also forwarding an e-mail
previously sent to Mr. John Robinson of your office describing the wind
generation facilities owned and operated by Enron Wind Corp. in California.

From our conversation, it is my understanding that you are not interested
in obtaining the information requested in your May 1 and May 18 letters for
any wind generation project (including the Green Power Project), save for
the name of a contact person.  Please confirm this understanding by return
e-mail.

The name of the contact person you seek appears below.

Very truly yours,

Enron Power Marketing, Inc.

Subject:  Monitoring of California Plant Outages

Dear Mr. Robinson:

Reference is made to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC)
letter dated May 1, 2001, directed to Enron Power Marketing, Inc. (EPMI),
relating to the above captioned subject.

The letter seeks outage information (the information) about generation
units in the State of California owned and/or operated by EPMI or any of
its affiliates.  As discussed in our recent telephone conversations,  Enron
Wind Corp., an affiliate of EPMI and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Enron
Corp., owns and operates various wind generation units in the state.  All
of these units, save for one, are QF's, and it is my understanding that you
are not be seeking the information on such units since their power is
subject to bilateral contracts with IOU's.  The remaining unit is the Green
Power Project in Palm Springs.  Enron Wind Corp. has a bilateral contract
with EPMI on the Green Power Project.

As regards the Green Power Project, the name of the contact person you
request is:

Mr. Tom Biernet
Vice President- Operations
Enron Wind Corp.
(661) 823-6750

A review of our files indicates that no outage reports or notices have been
sent to the CAISO or CPUC as of May 1, 2001, relating to the Green Power
Project.  Should any such notice or report be generated in the future, it
will be forwarded to your attention.

Should you have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to
contact me at (202) 464-9170.

Very truly yours,

Enron Power Marketing, Inc.
