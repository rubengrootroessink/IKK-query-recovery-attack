Hi Rick,

I don't know.   Steve never did call that afternoon to discuss the leadership 
issue.  (My comment to him will be that I would welcome him stepping into a 
leadership role on these issues, but that he needs to step up to the plate.  
This means being able to do Hill meetings on his own, being willing to step 
back and re-evaluate our strategies from time to time, and looking beyond 
Scott for policy and technical guidance).

I'm also planning to make some general comments to the group as a whole at 
our EBS GA meeting in Colorado next week.  I think I need to talk about 
individual versus group efforts.  The issues circling in my mind at the 
moment are:

People need to realize that individual success does not happen independently 
of the success of our group as a whole.
This means that every person in our group needs to be able and willing to 
work constructively will every other individual in our group.  No exceptions.
Decisions about who attends meetings, whether with the FCC, Congressional 
members and staff, or EBS executives will be determined according to  the 
nature and purpose of the meeting.  That means that sometimes I step aside 
for you or Linda or Steve Kean, and that sometimes one person in my group 
steps aside for another.  Individual success in not measured by the meetings 
that you attend.  It's measured by our effectiveness in achieving our agenda.
 Anything else you can suggest that will help make clear to people that they 
are focusing on the wrong issues and that this will have a serious negative 
impact on their performance reviews.

I really would like to get beyond this point as quickly as possible.  Please 
let me know if you ever think I'm wasting too much of your time with these 
petty issues.

How's London?  Wayne and Zal have had a series of travel complications, so 
I'm the only one in Argentina so far.  I had a very good day of meetings with 
our lawyer yesterday.  We've rescheduled meetings with the Argentine 
regulators for Wednesday afternoon, so that Wayne and Zal will be able to 
make them.  This means only one day in Sao Paolo and one day in Brasilia, but 
from all that  I've heard that's not a bad thing.

Talk to you soon.

Sue

Hi Steve,

The reason that I've used "DC Office" is that Linda has indicated that she 
wants to distinguish between your assignments and Allison's assignments.  I'm 
not sure if she's done this yet and I didn't want to presume anything.  If it 
works better to list your names individually I am happy to do that.  To be 
honest, though, I don't think Rick would be likely to interpret this to mean 
that your role is simply administrative.

Are you around at the end of the day today?  I have a meeting from 2:00-4:00, 
but maybe we could talk afterward about the other issues you raise.  Thanks,

Sue

Hi Sue:

This may be a function of the Washington office/EBS Government Affairs 
differing reporting relationships, but...

With the "DC office" appearing only in supporting roles on reports like 
these, Rick and Steve Kean are going to continue to have the impression that 
we exist to schedule meetings and execute plans formulated by others.  You 
know this is a sensitive point for me personally, but beyond that, it is 
important to my career development that I be seen as taking more of a lead.  
I suppose Allison would feel the same way once she becomes more comfortable 
and familiar with the issues.

Therefore, two requests.  

Would you consider listing Allison and me as individuals, not as "DC Office"?

Also -- and here I may be pushing it --  as you and I have discussed a couple 
of times, am I taking the lead in the cable issue?  What about the BLM 
issue?  I always appear to Rick and Steve to be supporting Scott on these 
initiatives.  In my own twisted mind, I think of myself as having more of a 
leadership role.

Sorry to continue to be ultra sensitive about this.  But frankly (just 
between the two of us, please) since we've just brought on 2 new Senior 
Directors in the past month (knocking me a couple of rungs down the seniority 
ladder in one fell swoop), I am trying to increase my visibility ... and 
maybe claim a little more credit for issues that I have before.

Happy as always to discuss.

Muchas gracias,
Steve
