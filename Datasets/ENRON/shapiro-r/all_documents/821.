Ozzie -
Here is an article talking about Reliant's effort to do what we were=20
discussing last week, regarding negawatts - getting wholesalers to pay for=
=20
them like they were actual generated power instead of the absence of.

FT Energy Article


By Rick Stouffer
rstouffer@ftenergy.com
The electricity supply-demand equation is simple: Match supply to demand an=
d=20
things are dandy. Demand overwhelms supply: build more supply.

Throughout the country, but particularly in California, there is no questio=
n=20
more supply is mandated=01*NIMBY (not in my backyard) be hanged. But what a=
bout=20
the demand side of the issue? What about getting customers involved in the=
=20
solution by allowing them to sell their excess power back into the system?=
=20

'Negawatts' nothing new
Granted, the concept of negawatts is nothing new; it was coined roughly a=
=20
quarter-century ago by the founder of the Boulder-based consulting firm E=
=20
Source: Amory Lovins. Many utilities today use customer curtailment to get=
=20
them through wattage rough spots from time to time.=20

All the existing independent system operators have actively considered=20
demand-side bids at one time or another, according to Richard Rudden,=20
president of the consulting firm R.J. Rudden Associates in Hauppauge, N.Y.=
=20

But what about a negawatt program serving the entire Western Interconnectio=
n?=20
Rather than a supply exchange, aka an independent system operator, put in=
=20
place a "demand exchange" where customers could make a choice: Do I produce=
=20
widgets, run my milling machines, build product or take the power I would=
=20
have used, bid it out and see what happens?=20

Just such a demand exchange within the Western Interconnection is being=20
championed by an unlikely proponent: Reliant Energy Inc.=20

The Houston-based energy giant already has testified in Washington, D.C.,=
=20
concerning the proposal, has had meetings with key Western state government=
=20
leadership and pitched its idea to trade associations and environmental=20
groups.=20

The scorecard: Thus far, no one has laughed, no one has walked away from th=
e=20
conversations=01*no one has said "no," according to Reliant's John H. Stout=
,=20
senior vice president of asset commercialization.=20

"You're taking forced, rotating outages and prioritizing the interruption,=
=20
with the customer (that) can take the outage doing so," said Stout.=20

Much of what Reliant proposes is included in Texas Republican Congressman J=
oe=20
Barton's Electricity Emergency Assistance bill, but no big generator is=20
pushing from the industry side like Reliant.=20

A demand exchange
Like generators, including Reliant, bidding load into the independent syste=
m=20
operator pool, a demand exchange allows retail customers to determine what=
=20
they could spare and bid in a specific load and acceptable price.=20

The negawatt dispatch clearinghouse would develop a bid stack and make it=
=20
available throughout the Western Systems Coordinating Council (WSCC). If a=
=20
particular system needed more power, it would contact the clearinghouse,=20
which would match the least cost set of bids that could be shipped, keeping=
=20
in mind additional transmission charges.=20

Once the bids were identified, the clearinghouse would contact the customer=
=20
and its local control area. The customer would interrupt and the host utili=
ty=20
would move the curtailed megawatts onto an export schedule.=20

One key to the program's success is that no one loses money. The customer=
=20
that gave up its designated electrons would continue to pay its retail=20
supplier for what it didn't actually use, and the customer would receive it=
s=20
bid price, times the megawatts curtailed, minus its regular retail charges,=
=20
plus any payment to the transmission provider.=20

"The key is it gets the incentives right at the margin," said William Hogan=
,=20
a professor at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government.=
=20

Another key to the Reliant-championed negawatt program is that it is not=20
seasonal; it doesn't lock a potential megawatt-shedder into a long-term=20
contract.=20

"You can bid into the market every day," said Stout.=20

"It offers a tremendous advantage in that it allows distributive decisions =
to=20
be made, how much a customer is willing to take for an energy entitlement,"=
=20
said Richard Tabors, president of the Cambridge, Mass.-based energy=20
consulting firm Tabors, Carmanis & Associates.=20
As Tabors points out, customers who sell back into the market obviously are=
=20
doing so to play the margin, to make money. But their efforts also will hav=
e=20
a serious impact on the spot market price.=20

"Every megawatt not consumed is a megawatt which doesn't have to be=20
produced," Tabors reasoned. "That lowers the marginal cost, the spot market=
=20
cost. It really comes down to what (specific megawatts) are worth to someon=
e=20
and not worth to me."=20

Heavy users thrilled
Heavy industrial users already are thrilled with the regional negawatt=20
proposal. "We think it is a well thought-out program. We feel customers hav=
e=20
the right to buy power, they should have the right to sell power and ought =
to=20
be compensated like the generators," said John Anderson, executive director=
=20
of ELCON, the Electricity Consumers Resource Council, which represents larg=
e=20
industrial users from nearly every manufacturing sector.=20

Anderson favors this particular plan because it gives the customer choice=
=01*
sound familiar?=01*allowing it to determine when it shuts down or gives up =
its=20
power.=20

"This is voluntary. You know when you will be shut down and thus you won't=
=20
incur any damages," said Anderson. "Many proposals tell the customer to cut=
=20
usage, but it costs money for industrial users to just shut down. Command a=
nd=20
control proposals treat everyone alike=01*and they're not."=20

Stout said at least two vendors have expressed interest in taking part in t=
he=20
Reliant proposal, with discussions already taking place with Automated Powe=
r=20
Exchange Inc. (APX).=20

"We have had discussions with Reliant; we're in the business of working wit=
h=20
generators," said John Melby, vice president for North American marketing f=
or=20
Santa Clara, Calif.-based APX.=20

According to Melby, APX represents more than half the demand response in th=
e=20
California ISO. He said the company could utilize key computer programs and=
=20
systems previously developed to get the region-wide negawatt program up and=
=20
running.=20

The down side
There could be a number of problems in moving forward with such a large pla=
n.=20
Consultant Tabors, for example, pointed to the White House and the Bush=20
administration's seeming preoccupation with supply.=20

Harvard's Hogan said having the power available when needed was key, while=
=20
Reliant's Stout said the biggest hurdle was that many states prohibit retai=
l=20
customers from selling load back into the wholesale market. An obvious=20
solution to that would be passage of the Barton bill; however, nothing is=
=20
certain in such a divided Congress.=20

Thus, Stout continues to travel the West pushing the negawatt program.=20
California Gov. Gray Davis was briefed on the plan some two weeks ago when =
he=20
called a meeting of all California's generators.=20

"We thought he (Davis) generally liked the idea," Stout said.=20

Next up on Reliant's hit list is S. David Freeman, former head of the Los=
=20
Angeles Department of Water and Power and now Davis' California energy=20
conservation "czar."=20

"We've already raised the issue with him (Freeman), but we're looking to pl=
ug=20
him in," Stout said.=20
