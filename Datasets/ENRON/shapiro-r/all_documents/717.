This confirms our discussion re:  staffing issues in San Francisco:

(1) I will contact Chris Calger when he returns to Portland next week and get 
his support for the change in Sandy's reporting relationship.  I will also 
contact Jeff Dasovich and Susan Mara.  

(2) I will contact H.R. to confirm our messaging for the PRC process and the 
lattitude I have in delivering the mid-term review.  

(3) I will deliver the change in reporting relationships for Sandy so that it 
coincides with the mid-year break in the legislative cycle.

(4) We will delay any other reporting changes in the West until after the 
mid-year PRC process.
