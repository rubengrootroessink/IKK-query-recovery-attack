Rick -

I hope everything is going well for you.

Whenever you have time, I'd appreciate very much your candid comments and
suggestions on our new on-line energy publication, Energy Business Watch,
which you can access by clicking on www.energybusinesswatch.com.

Our goal in launching Energy Business Watch is to take maximum advantage of
the speed and power of the internet to deliver the energy-related
information you need each day within minutes after breaking developments
occur.

To accomplish this goal, Energy Business Watch provides a unique combination
of news coverage and selected links to other resources not currently
available on any other site. These features include:

o Exclusive in-depth reporting on breaking news by one of the strongest
reporting teams in the business

o Exclusive expert commentary

o Links e-mailed directly to you each morning with important, interesting
stories from other sources that you're not likely to have time to search out
on your own

o News flashes during the course of each day on important breaking
developments

o Continuously updated links to important decisions and reports, such as
the California ISO's assessment of the likelihood of rolling black-outs in
California this summer

o Live stock quotes, spot market prices for electricity, natural gas and
other fuels and day ahead prices for electricity in each region of the
country

o Special reports, not found in any other publication, on business
developments affecting the energy industry and emerging new technologies
that in coming years could reshape the industry.

Over the next few months, we plan to add other features, including live
streaming video coverage of important developments, conferences, special
research reports and other specialized information services not currently
available from any other source.

Our goal is to become your best source for the specialized,
industry-specific information you need each day to excel in your work. To
achieve this goal, however, we need your help -- both now and in coming
months -- by sharing with us your advice and feedback regarding the
information services that will best serve your needs.

We'd appreciate, therefore, your taking the time to check out our site by
clicking on the attached link and signing up for a free two-week trial
subscription. After you've had a chance to see what we're doing, please use
the "Feedback" button to give us your comments and suggestions regarding
what we've done thus far and the features and services you'd like to see us
add in coming months.

We'd also appreciate your passing along the link to our site to others who
might be interested in what we're doing.

We're excited about this new venture and appreciate very much your taking
the time to visit our site.
