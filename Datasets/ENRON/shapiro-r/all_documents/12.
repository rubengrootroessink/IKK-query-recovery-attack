Yes Rick asked me to look at it - and I will get back to everyone with more 
information.  From what I know at this point, there is a lot of confusion 
over the relationship between the new federal law and state efforts to enact 
the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act ('UETA"). (There are some very 
complex and unanswered preemption issues that remain).  I would not take UETA 
off of our state legislative agenda yet.

Bob--rumor has it  (I think that rumor started with Rick mentioning it to 
me!) that you are putting together an analysis of this bill?  Just wanted to 
save Mr. Burns some time if that is the case.  COuld you please make sure 
that the folks on this e mail get a copy of your analysis.  Thanks.

Thanks. Enacting electronic signature bills was one of our top ten priorities 
for 2000, so if we could get them all in one swoop, what a nice way to take 
credit!!!!!

Subject: electronic signature legislation

Steve/Chris--I've been working on putting together a compilation of the 
individual state legislation that passed this year for the midwest region on 
electronic signature authorization.  I saw a blurb in the paper yesterday 
that Congress passed a bill this week out of the House on the same issue.  
Could you give me some insight as to whether the federal legislation is 
comprehensive and will it trump the state legislation or does it granfather 
state legislation.
