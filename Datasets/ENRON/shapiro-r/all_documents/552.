Rick,

I have spoken with Jeff's office and he will be in Houston on May 30th.  At 
the moment he has an 8:30-9:30, 9:45 "E-Speak" appointment and a 3:00-4:00pm 
floor meeting.  Joannie also mentioned that PR is trying to schedule some 
interviews and May 30th is one of several days they are looking at.  Joannie 
will check with PR and get back with me later today as to a possible meeting 
time.

I will ask my assistant to check on Jeff's schedule and try to be there 
myself that day. ( If not Jeff, I'll aim for Greg Whalley). Thanks.

Subject: Visit of Lord Mayor Sir David Howard, Request to visit Enron Tra 
ding Floor at 3 PM Wed 30 May


Dear all -- Please accept my apologies, but I have clearly caused some 
confusion regarding the venue for the Mayor's visit to Enron.  The Mayor and  
his entourage will be visiting the US in May and therefore they are seeking 
to take a tour of our trading floor in the Houston office, not London.   

In terms of who the Mayor should meet with while he is in Houston, I feel we 
should ask a senior representative of the company to host him on a tour of 
the trading floor.  Also, if he is available and willing, perhaps we should 
see if Jeff Skilling could meet with the group for a few minutes?  FG

**************************************

FYI -- Please see the request below regarding a proposed visit to Enron's 
trading floor at the end of May by the Lord Mayor of the City of London, 
which has come in to Carrie Robert from the British Consulate in Houston.   I 
would see this particular request as warranting a high level of attention and 
would welcome your views on who would be the best host for the meeting/tour, 
before I respond to Carrie.

Many thanks,
Fiona

Hi Fiona - Below is information on another request to visit Enron.  Please 
let me know if this is high level enough and the benefit for Enron if we 
accomodate their request.

Thank so much for your assistance.
Carrie
