Rick, I am happy top take over the responsibility to sign the DASH. However, 
I query what a signature from the regulatory group implies given that the 
DASH does not include a regulatory risk assessment.

kind regards

As I am no longer responsible for regulatory affairs in Japan, I will not be 
signing off on this.  It should either be Nicholas o'day in Tokyo, or Richard 
Shapiro in Houston.   thanks  mcs
