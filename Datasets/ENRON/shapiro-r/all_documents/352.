Rick - 

based on our meeting last week and budget savings information received so far 
attached is the revised headcount information for your review and comment

I have budget savings information from everyone except Jean Ryall and hope to 
get that information tonight; once I have all the numbers I'll send something 
to you

I hope to meet with Sue Nord today to talk to her about the cost savings for 
EBS G/A to make sure I understand what numbers she is offering


also - I asked Ginger to put me on your calendar for Friday afternoon 
(4:30-5:00) to go over headcount, travel policy, phone policy, budget 
savings, etc.; would you like me to work on the Europe, Asia and Australia 
budgets since those are now under your control; if so, are we looking for 
savings opportunities there as well

Thanks,

Eric
