Two weeks ago, Phil Harris sent a letter to the CEOs of PJM member-companies 
urging them to designate a representative to participate in PJM's 
Communications Group.  The initial step would be to highlight the four years 
of success in the PJM wholesale market and enhance the public's confidence in 
the value of competitive electric markets.  

Since Enron has already committed money to EPSA's multi-state communications 
effort as well as an aggressive communications plan in NY, I thought it would 
be useful to meet with PJM's manager of communications to try and get a 
better idea of what they are trying to achieve.  

On Friday, June 1st, I met with Beth Foley -- PJM's Manager of 
Communications.  Beth is new to PJM.  The bottom line is that PJM has never 
had a communications office.  Press inquiries and other external 
communications have been handled from PJM's customer care center.  This year, 
PJM decided it needed to create a new division to deal soley with 
communications/pr issues.

As of last week, 35 member companies had responded to the letter from Phil 
Harris.  The next step is likely to be a meeting of all the interested 
companies in PA.  

They're starting from ground zero, so I shared some of Enron's experiences in 
NY and DC with her:

Research is useful in order to define message points, and keep the effort 
focused
Many companies are being asked to fund various "communications plans" as a 
result of the CA fallout.  These companies (including Enron) expect their 
dollars to create value for them, and if the communications efforts are 
repetitive or not providing value then the efforts aren't worth funding.
External assistance in the development of a pr plan are extremely useful and 
necessary for comprehensive efforts.
Buy-in from member companies on the message points will be a critical first 
step and will require a good amount of time in the early stages.
Need to identify the overall goal and time-frame for achieving them.  (PJM is 
not really attempting to do a "summer crisis" effort.  Their's is much more 
long-term focused.

Tom Hoatson and I are on PJM's list as contacts for this effort.  And I 
expect to hear back from PJM in the near future regarding a meeting of all 
the interested parties.

Please call if you have questions.
