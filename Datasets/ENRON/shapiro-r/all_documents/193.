In yesterday's prepared testimony before Barton's subcommittee, Chairman 
Hebert stated:  "Finally, I emphasize that the Commission's open access 
program for natural gas transportation has resulted in a vibrant, 
transparent, liquid competitive market for natural gas.  It is critical that 
we continue to develop the same type of competitive, comparable markets for 
electric energy and transmission as well, and to do so as expeditiously as 
possible."
