As discussed, please find attached a description of the NETA rules.  There is 
also a plethora of other documents going into the policy background etc on 
the regulator Ofgem's website at www.ofgem.gov.uk.  Daily statistics are also 
available at http://www.bmreports.com.

Rick - it would be good to chat further next week.  One of the things I'm 
particularly interested in is how they've addressed the issue of ancillary 
services in California and elsewhere in the States.  One of the clear 
problems emerging with NETA is half-hourly energy prices being driven by 
frequency response etc.

In the meantime, if you need anything further please let me know.

Regards,

Paul
