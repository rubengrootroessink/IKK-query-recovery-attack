Sorry.  Don't know how we left you off the final distribution.



As for Ader, yes he is making progress.  We have three good opportunities in 
NEPOOL, one in PJM and are travelling next week to TN.  Also, Illinois looks 
very promising.  The main challenge for Jeff at the moment is getting staffed 
up to pursue all the opportunities we are uncovering.  I am helping Jeff on 
each of the leads, working with the appropriate regional people in our group 
to get plugged in.  I know you are probably buried but I would love to catch 
you for 10 minutes some time and bring you up to date in a little more 
detail.  I will call Ginger and see if she set something up.

            -Dan

Do you have e-mail version of business plan given to Delainey? If so, please 
forward. Hope all is well- I'd be interested to hear if Ader is making any 
progress. Take care & thanks.
