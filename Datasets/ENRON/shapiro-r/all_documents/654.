Would consider it if the Republicans were not so wrong on the social issues I 
care about (personally).

The DNC is on its way to causing irreparable harm with the energy industry.  
I think they have grossly over estimated the political gain in slamming the 
oil and gas industry.  We will see.

I think Steve's meeting with Rep. Adam Smith and your meeting with the DLC 
are evident in the New Dem approach.   They are only my last hope.

Please see the attached New Democrat Coalition Energy Policy outline.  While 
not a comprehensive document, it does NOT call for price caps.  The New Dem 
plan does call for the development of national interconnection, as well as a 
creation of an Energy Reliability Organization to help facilitate the role of 
RTOs.  

This is in stark comparison to the DNC and Democratic Policy Committees 
approach.
