The material re the hedge proposal has gone to Milnthorp and will go from Rob 
to Lavorato presumably today.  Our expectation is that there will be some 
discussion about the term sheet, prices, and letter early next week.  I would 
suggest that we get the Lay letters out early next week, without the 
reference to the hedge, because I suspect that the resolution of the hedging 
issue  by Lavorato , at al. etc. (particularly with respect to pricing)  will 
take another week.  I would rather not have that process further delay 
sending Lay's letters to Harris and Wilson.

Are you going to talk to Lavorato re:  letter  to Wilson ... before we 
proceed any further?

Subject: Draft of Lay letters to Harris and Wilson

                    Rick, I attach drafts of letters to Harris and Wilson.  
The revised letter to Harris refers to the letter that Lavorato may send re 
the hedge proposal.  That added language will obviously have to come out if 
Lavo decides not to send his letter or if, by the time Lay's letter is to go, 
it is still uncertain whther Lavo will make his proposal.   Address for copy  
of Wilson's letter to Purchase is  Bryne Purchase, Deputy Minister, Ministry 
of Energy Science &Technology, Hearst Block, 4th Floor, 900 Bay Street, 
Toronto, Ontario, M7A 2E1; Address for copy of Wilson's letter  to Judy 
Hubert is Judy Hubert, Assistant Deputy Minister, Energy Policy, Ministry of 
Energy Science &Technology, 3rd Floor, 880 Bay Street, Toronto, Ontario M7A 
2C1.
