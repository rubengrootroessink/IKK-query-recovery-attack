Cindy and Richard,
I promise not to send any more resumes.

However, this woman is a very, very bright first-year MBA
seeking a SUMMER internship. For an MBA, she has a
nontraditional background. But she is serious about
business and awfully smart. Also personable and mature.

Please feel free to contact me about her.

Hope all's well.

Best,
Sandy
