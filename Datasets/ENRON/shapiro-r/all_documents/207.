Rick -- I couldn't remember if I forwarded this to you.   It is a really good 
summary of EGM's business activities (Steve Kean had asked for an electronic 
copy, but let me know if you want a hard copy).

Thanks,

Lisa

This is a fantastic help!  I have shared it with others in DC, for our 
education.
