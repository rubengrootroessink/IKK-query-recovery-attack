Rick, this idea of a 500MW option  was first raised by me in February as a 
solution to the concern about the availability of the first Pickering A unit 
(515MW) during the Winter 2001-2002.  It was dismissed summarily at that 
time.

Garrett/Paul - Can you guys work with the North East desk to price out a 
500MW option at the New York/Ontario intertie as an insurance policy for the 
Ontario government re market opening. You will recall that this was something 
we had suggested a while back and didnt receive much support. However, 
following Lavorato's meeting with Harris, Lavo is adamant that we send a term 
sheet to Harris directly outlining both an call option structure and a swap 
structure. 

Second, it is quite apparant to me that everything hinges on the September 
readiness report. If its favorable, I think there is a good chance of a fall 
market opening. With that said however, we are in the hands of the IMO and 
the OEB. I'm comfortable that we can continue to influence the IMO to produce 
a favorable announcement but I dont know what we can do to ensure that the 
OEB says its ready. Any suggestions, comments? I dont want to be in a 
position that one LDC  could halt market opening. 

Regards
Rob
