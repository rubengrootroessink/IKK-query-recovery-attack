		 Subject: FYI:  TWO PRESS RELEASES TODAY FROM GOVERNOR DAVIS...


FYI, more of the same from the Governor's office.  Also, I have received a
couple of calls about whether it is true that Senator Dunn rescheduled the
generator hearing this week that had previously been cancelled.  The rumor
is true, but it is my understanding that the discussion has been occurring
directly between Dunn's office and individual lawyers for involved
generators, so I can't really add anything substantive to the mix.

OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR 
PR01:308
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
06/27/2001 
GOVERNOR DAVIS SWITCHES ON NEW ERA IN CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY HISTORY 
Governor Opens First Major Power Plant in CA Since '88 
KERN COUNTY 
With the flick of a switch, Governor Gray Davis launched on a new era in
California's energy history by ceremoniously switching on the 320 megawatt
Sunrise Power Project in Kern County. Sunrise is the first major power plant
to come on line in California since 1988. 
"We are taking control of our energy destiny," Governor Davis said. "This is
the first major power plant built in California since 1988. It's clean,
efficient and it was built in record time."
The Sunrise Power Project is jointly owned by Edison Mission Energy and
Texaco Power and Gasification. Edison Mission Energy has agreed to sell the
power generated at the Sunrise plant to California's Department of Water
Resources under a long-term contract at a reasonable rate. By the summer of
2003, the plant is expected to produce 585 megawatts.
"We're building more new power plants than at any other time in our
history," Governor Davis said. "Next week, I will be cutting the ribbon on
the 500 megawatt Sutter power plant near Yuba City. It will be the largest
gas-fired power plant built in California in a generation. Over the next two
weeks, we'll be bringing a combined total of more than 1,300 MW on line -
enough to power the entire city of San Jose." 
In the 12 years before Governor Davis took office, not a single major power
plant was licensed in California. Under Governor Davis' leadership,
California has licensed 16 major power plants and 10 "peaker" plants.
Sunrise is the first of four scheduled to come on line this summer. 
The combination of these new power plants, with additional renewables,
distributed generation, and re-rates of existing power plants, will bring
more than 4,000 new megawatts online by the end of September. At no other
time in the history of California have so many new power plants been under
construction and in the pipeline.
Construction began on the Sunrise Power Project on December 7, 2000, making
it operational in a record 6 and a half months. The construction force
worked 18 hour days, six days a week, and the plant was brought on 32 days
ahead of schedule. Because the plant was completed before July 1, it is
eligible for more than $1 million in construction incentive payments under
the Governor's Executive Order (D-32). 
"None of this would have been possible without the commitment of Edison
Mission Energy, Texaco, and a dedicated construction force," Governor Davis
said. "I would like to commend Black and Veatch, ARB and the State Building
and Construction Trades Council for moving heaven and earth to bring this
project on line ahead of schedule. If not for your Herculean efforts, we
would not be here today."
