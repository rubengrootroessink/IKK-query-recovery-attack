Rick,

Jane Wilson leaving is a loss to us professionally as well as to me 
personally. I will really miss Jane. I would like to speak with you about 
regulatory coverage. One relatively quick thing I would like to have happen 
is to get Amr Ibrahim out here for a few weeks. I'm thinking about perhaps 
overlapping with Jane for one full week before she leaves (he would be here 
on Monday, June 11) and have him remain for 2 full weeks after Jane is gone.  
Primary purpose in having Amr here is to oversee transition from Jane to our 
local team on the ground, who Jane has trained. Plus Amr can evaluate our 
regulatory needs and ensure that we have the right quality and number of 
people. Obviously, we are in a wind-down mode in India, but this will take 
several months (perhaps up to a year), and there will be a number of 
legal/regulatory matters to deal with. Finally, I would feel comfortable if 
you had someone on ground here, such as Amr,  for a while serving as your 
eyes and ears, so that you can be comfortable that regulatory affairs are 
being handled properly.

I suggest Amr because he is well known out here, he has done a very good job 
and is well respected. If you would prefer someone else come out in this 
interim period, let's discuss that. I will admit that I do not have any idea 
what Amr is working on right now so I don't know his time availability.

I recommend we speak on Thursday or Friday morning. I have phone calls on 
Thursday from about 8:30am Houston time until 10:30 am Houston time. On 
Friday, I have calls from 8:30 am to 9:30 am. If we could speak either before 
this or after that, that would be fine.
  
Please either send me an e-mail and a phone number where I can reach you, or 
you can call me in the office at 91-22-653-4034, or cell phone at 
9198200-20090.

Thanks,
Wade

Ditto. Jane will indeed be missed....She's done a great job in India and in 
everything else she's done for Enron. I'll work with Wade to ensure the 
regulatory coverage  transition is a smooth one .

Jane,

Well, this ranks high amongst all of the bad news of late.  The company will 
lose a valuable contributor when you leave as well as a role model for the 
young women here at Enron.  Your willingness to dive in and work the hard 
issues is one of your strengths and I know that you will be greatly missed.  
Best of luck, I hope you will stay in touch, I know that I will miss hearing 
about your adventures.

Best Regards,
Rebecca

Subject: Notice

After almost 13 years with Enron, I've decided to pursue other opportunities 
outside of the company.  While the problems in India remain challenging and I 
have enjoyed my tenure here, the job I've been offered is really too good to 
pass up.  Thus, please consider this e:mail as formal notice of my intention 
to resign from the company, effective close of business June 16, 2001.
