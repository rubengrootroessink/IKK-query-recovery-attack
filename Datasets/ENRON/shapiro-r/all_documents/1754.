Sue --

Earlier this week, you received an email from the PEP team which included the 
Performance Evaluations of your employees, both Exempt and Non-Exempt.  
Please remember that the final Performance Evaluations should be completed 
with your employees, forms signed and returned to me at EB1665B no later than 
Friday, August 17th.  I will be preparing a report for your use noting the 
final ratings of your Exempt employees from the PRC meetings and distribute 
that within the next week.

For your Non-Exempt employees, I have listed below all eligible employees for 
whom you should complete a Performance Evaluation.  However, I need the 
rating for each employee so it may be input into the PEP system.  The 
descriptions for Non-Exempt ratings are defined as:

1 - Consistently performs above expectations
2 - Meets expectations
3 - Does not meet expectations

Please indicate the ratings for each of your non-exempt employees below and 
return to me no later than Wednesday, July 11, 2001.
