Hello All -- Just and update on the Chicago Deal.  
 The ordinance which would permit the City to enter into a multi-year 
agreement was introduced in the City Council yesterday and the Mayor held a 
post-Council press conference with our deal being the first issue addressed 
(and the only one to have a nice graphic showing its benefits).  Several 
high-profile issues were also on the agenda (racial profiling, redistricting, 
legal representations for aldermen re: school locations, school board CEO 
Paul Vallas' future, Gery Chico's replacement, etc.) so the press spent 
several minutes questioning both the Mayor and City Commissioner Bill Abolt 
on our issue.  Abolt did a masterful job of handling the issue with his point 
being that the City has lived up to its commitment to 1) develop a 
competitive market, 2) reduce costs while, 3) promoting green power 
(renewables).  The press focused on whether ComEd was resentful that 60% of 
the City's requirements will be covered by this agreement to which Mr. Dwyer, 
of ComEd, after the press conference stated that they viewed the deal as a 
win because ComEd got the green component of the City's business.  Peggy 
Mahoney also made a post conference statement and was welcomed by the press 
and was given a favorable treatment by the press (Dick Kay, Andy Shaw and 
Mike Flannery).  
 On balance, I think that the press did not know what to make of this deal 
but knew that this is an appropriate response to the drubbing the Mayor has 
received in the past for putting all of the City's energy needs in one basket 
laid at the feet of ComEd.  As you know, this is only the introduction of our 
deal to the City Council and it has not been approved yet.  We expect that 
that will occur either later in June or certainly by the end of July.  The 
actual contract will be finalized and signed at that time.  In the mean time, 
I expect that the press will have more questions as this matter moves forward 
and it goes to the Council's Energy Committee.  The City is doing the heavy 
lifting and it is best that Enron not take an over large profile -- but we 
also cannot become invisible either.  Julie Starsiak of Ronan & Potts and 
Peggy Mahoney are very much involved.

Attached is the "final" form of the EESI - City of Chicago Agreement that we
forwarded to the City this evening.  It is anticipated that this form of the
Agreement will be attached to the Ordinance that will be introduced at the
City Council meeting tomorrow.  As you know, the actual Agreement will be
finalized 24 hours prior to execution.

As always, please feel free to call with any questions.
