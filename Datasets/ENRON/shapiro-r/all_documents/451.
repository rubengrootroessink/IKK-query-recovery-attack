FYI - This is something a little different for me.  I discussed these 
opportunities to Duran last month and they appear to have some juice.  Tony 
Ravosa is a contact of mine who has had me in front of Gov Rowland on a 
regular basis, which led to the Conn. sites.  The NY site however is the most 
attractive.  I will keep you posted as to the outcome. Steve

Tony -

Thank you for spending so much time with me the last several days.  Driving 
out to Brookhaven, LI, to meet with Steve and me was really beyond the call 
of duty.  Your efforts there and in Connecticut gave me a very good initial 
idea of the opportunities we may have in these two locations.

My first pass look at the New Britain and Waterbury sites in Connecticut 
suggest that they will certainly be permittable.  The support from the local 
municipalities and the Governor which you described is encouraging.  My next 
step on these sites is to get an indication internally as to how interested 
Enron is, strategically and financially, in Connecticut power.  I know that 
you want a statement of interest fairly quickly from us, so you can offer the 
opportunities to other developers if we decline.

The Brookhaven site on Long Island also looks interesting, and we have 
already stated our interest in New York power.  The good news and the bad 
news of this site is that AEP controls a 20-acre site a half mile away from 
it.  The good part  is that AEP has already initially identified the gas, 
power, and water interconnections for this area, and shown that a power plant 
is environmentally low impact here.  The bad news is that a second plant now 
might exceed LIPA's and the local communities capacity for power.  My next 
steps are to informally identify the transmission constraints.  I have 
already talked to Dan Staines about this, and Monday we tentatively decided 
to seek a meeting with Steve's contact at KeySpan the week of May 16th when 
I'm back in New York.

Finally, we discussed hypothetically what The Vince Group's interest would be 
in these sites, should we decide to pursue any of them.  You would be most 
interested in being retained as the local facilitator for these projects, 
which Steve agrees you are very capable of doing, with a success payment to 
you upon deal closure, to reimburse you for bringing these sites to us.  I 
will investigate internally if this is workable.

Tony, thank you again for your time and interest.  I will get back to you as 
I complete my initial investigations in the next two weeks on these three 
sites.

Rick
