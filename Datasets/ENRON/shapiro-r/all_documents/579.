Thanks Rick.
I will call her later and suggest:
 1. Get face to face with Paul (difficult because his appearances in 
Frankfurt office have been rare last six months, and when he is there she 
complains of little communication, virtually no involvement.)
 2. Speak Stephan Diescher, Frankfurt HR. (I have been advised by London HR 
not to offer myself on a continuing basis as "confidante", since this may 
encourage her to avoid confronting Paul as her direct supervisor with her 
grievances.)
 3. Avail herself of your offer.

Tell Viviana that I am prepared to be of assistance here if she so desires. 
Thanks.

I will do my best, Viviana. Sorry our discussion had to be cut short last 
week. I have meetings this morning and am travelling to Brussels this 
afternoon. Would you like to talk to someone in HR too, or have you already 
done so?
Peter.

Subject: Follow up last week meeting

Hello Peter, 

hope you're fine. 

I'm wondering whether it would be possible for you to call me today, because 
I would like to continue with you the discussion we started last week when I 
was in London.

I have to admit that I'm quite worried and I do not know what to expect. 

Thank you very much in advance. 

Viviana
