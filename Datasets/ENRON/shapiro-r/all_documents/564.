Aleck & Richard:

Just a quick update following my meetings yesterday in the Premier's Office.

Without question, the majority of decision-makers were leaning strongly
towards announcing a firm Spring 2002 opening date.

It has been conveyed to me that our (Enron/GPC) efforts prior to the
announcement by the Minister made a significant impact on the softening of
the announcement, making May 2002 a deadline and leaving the possibility for
a November opening.  While other stakeholders were advocating a November
opening (also largely thanks to the Enron/GPC effort, e.g. Board of Trade),
their arguments did not provide the same technical persuasiveness (with
concerns such as those regarding supply) as the Enron effort.  This
expertise coupled with sensitivity towards the political needs and pressures
resulted in an argument that surpassed those being made by some of the
industrials.

Recent comments by the Minister and others also suggest that the
government's message may change to "working towards November".  The
Lay/Harris meeting, our ongoing efforts to mitigate the influence of market
opening opponents, and our efforts to persuade decision-makers that the four
conditions have been met should help us meet our objectives.
