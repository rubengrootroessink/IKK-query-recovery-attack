Here's a summary:

? WGU focuses on "competency-based education"--apparently it gives credit for 
job experience, etc.  
? Degrees offered include:  AS, BS, MS in Learning and Technology, Graduate 
Certificates in Technology and Instructional Design, and an Undergraduate 
Certificate.  Focus is teaching and information technology.
? They appear to offer course-work as an employee-benefit and the potential 
to earn a college degree through "distance learning"--like University of 
Phoenix.
? On 11.27.00, WGU received "Candidate For Accreditation" status by the 
Inter-Regional Accrediting Committee (IRAC).  
? WGU partners with AT&T, Cisco Systems, Novell, Sun Microsystems, and 3Com.

implementation.  The NAB consists of AOL, Apple, AT&T, Cisco Systems, 
Convergys, Drake International, IBM, ITP, KPMG Consulting, Micron, Microsoft,
