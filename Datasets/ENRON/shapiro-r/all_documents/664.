Chris:  Following up on my earlier email which reported on the comment made 
by IPSCO's CEO at the steel conference that "traders should be held legally 
responsible for what's going on"......it appears that there is a push by the 
domestics to change the trade laws to "obtain relief from injury caused by 
traders who facilitate dumping."   In a speech to the Steel Caucus last fall, 
LTV's Chairman stated that " International steel traders and foreign steel 
producers are becoming ever more sophisticated -- and brazen -- in their 
evasion and circumvention of U.S. trade laws."  

We need to keep a close eye on their lobbying efforts in Washington.   I am 
especially concerned about this in light of Nucor's comment to Jeff McMahon 
that Enron's activities may be "illegal."   [FYI, I have discussed this with 
Julia Murray and Betsy Hafner (PGFM), and they don't agree with Nucor's 
allegation.]   Having said that, they are totally paranoid about Enron's 
entry into the steel market, and I want to make certain that we're not the 
subject of an unfair trade investigation.

Let's get together with Betsy to discuss as soon as she returns from India.   
Thanks.

Lisa

		 Subject: Statement at AISI conference

Lisa,
 
Andy asked me to investigate the statement at the AISI conference regarding
traders.  I have attached an AISI policy statement calling on Congress to
enact reforms to U.S. trade law and listing, as one example, reforms that
would make it possible to  obtain relief from injury caused by traders who
facilitate dumping (number "(5)" under "Positive trade law provisions").
Thus, it appears that AISI is advocating for a change in U.S. trade law as
opposed to claiming that traders are subject to anti-dumping duties under
existing law.  I have also attached a statement by the AISI Vice-Chairman
referring to injury caused by traders (fifth paragraph and first bullet
point of the ninth paragraph). 
 
Thank you,
Leslie
