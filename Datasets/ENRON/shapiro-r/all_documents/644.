Steve and Rick - In response to your question regarding the European 
allocation, here are responses on the Keeler and Worthen allocations.  These 
were the only two that Europe had required backup on when receiving the 
allocation.  Mike - By copy of this note, can you provide backup on the 
Europe allocation for your cost center, Henry's, and Marc's?  Thanks!

Elizabeth,
My group's support services are more global in nature, rather than providing 
services to any one unit.  Services include the administration of the 
corporate EHS web site and regulatory subcsriptions, risk assessment of 
acquisitions, divestitures  & major capital projects, corprate responsibility 
initiatives, & performance reporting.  I divided the business unit 
allocations based on 2001 business growth, maturity of their EHS management 
systems, and historical use.

Please let me know if any additional questions arise.

Thanks,
SW

Allocation to Enron Europe reflects an estimated 7.5% use of our group's time 
for FY2001 (revised dollar amount of $75,965).    As directed by Mike Terraso 
and Steve Kean, we expect to increase our commercial support focus in 2001 
towards European and other international wholesale and retail markets, and 
will be hiring additional staff to focus in this area.   We expect our 
current North American activities to expand to Europe and other global 
markets, including:

Providing competitive intelligence (timely information and analysis) to 
commercial units based on environmental policy/regulation in Europe and 
worldwide.  Assist commercial groups with analysis of impacts on business and 
identify business opportunities related to environmental policies.  Subjects 
include:
Global Climate Change -- carbon dioxide/greenhouse gas emission regulation
Air quality regulation -- SO2/Acid Rain, NOx, mercury, particulate matter
Renewable Energy & Energy Efficiency - renewable mandates, credit/offset 
trading, environmental disclosure/labeling
Industrial/Global Markets - environmental issues facing new Enron markets, 
i.e. pulp & paper, steel, or existing markets, i.e emissions, coal, weather.

Coordinate advocacy on environmental policy issues worldwide, working closely 
with government affairs & public affairs units.     Maintain ongoing 
relationships with key environmental policy makers and build effective 
coalitions with industry organizations, NGOs, and other stakeholders on 
behalf of Enron businesses.

If you have any questions or require additional information, please let me 
know.
