Connell: Power cost twice Davis' figure 
July 6, 2001 
By JOHN HOWARD
The Orange County Register 
SACRAMENTO -- The average cost of electricity purchased under $43 billion of 
worth of state contracts is actually more than double the amount reported by 
Gov. Gray Davis' administration, state Controller Kathleen Connell said 
Thursday. 
Connell said her staff's analysis put the per-megawatt average at $170, 
compared with $69 to $79 estimated by Davis. 
Connell stopped short of suggesting that the higher cost could drive another 
increase in rates, although consumer groups said the higher amount likely 
would require some future increase. 
The controller, who writes the state's checks, said her figures assume fixed 
prices for natural gas over the duration of the contracts, which range from a 
few months to 20 years. 
The administration, noting that nearly half its contracts are pegged to the 
fluctuating market price of natural gas, said costs on many of the contracts 
would decline over time. 
Consumer groups were skeptical of the administration's numbers. 
"You could cut these numbers in various ways and make different averages, 
long-range or short-range contracts, peak power or nonpeak, and probably 
either average could be defended mathematically," said Nettie Hoge of The 
Utility Reform Network. "We can't tell you whether it's $69 or $170 - the 
contracts are very convoluted and complex."
