Marty - here are two versions of direct access legislation that will get some 
attention next week.  The first is the current version of the Bowen bill. The 
second is a retail coalition bill that will be introduced next week.  Primary 
differences are this:

The Bowen bill gives more latitude to the PUC to determine whether retail 
customers can participate in direct access.  The Coalition bill gives a much 
more prescriptive description on how the exit fee should be calculated.

In the Coalition bill, there are two components to the exit fee:
a backward looking part to cover DWR costs since Jan 17
a forward looking part to cover unavoidable future costs, which does not 
apply if 
  - for res and small commercial customers, DA load is less than 5% of total 
res and small commercial load
  - for large customers, total DA load is less than the "net short"
  - for self gen customers, the customer has given 180 days prior notification

Both have a re-entry fee for return to utility service.

Harry,
Thanks. 
Can you get me whatever has been written concerning the proposed exit fees 
for customers that contemplate using a direct access provider in the future?
