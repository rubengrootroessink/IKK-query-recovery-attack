RE:  Denmark Approves Ratification of the Kyoto Protocol
DATE: May 30, 2001
______________________________________________________________________________
_________
Yesterday, the Danish Parliament passed a resolution approving the Kyoto 
Protocol, allowing Denmark to ratify the treaty jointly with other EU member 
states.  Denmark is the first EU member to take such strong government action 
related to ratification of the Kyoto Protocol.  Currently, Romania is the 
only industrialized nation to have ratified the treaty.  
While Denmark's action is largely symbolic, it puts pressure on the U.S. and 
other EU members to keep the international negotiations on track and puts 
mild pressure on other EU members to approve the treaty in preparation for 
joint ratification.
Please see Dow Jones article below.
Background
The Bush Administration is currently reviewing U.S. climate change policy 
with the aim of releasing an alternative approach to the Kyoto Protocol in 
late June.  The international climate change negotiations are scheduled to 
resume in mid-July in Bonn, Germany, but could be postponed based on the 
substance of the U.S. plan or a lack of progress during informal Ministerial 
meetings in late June.  
EU Ministers have publicly endorsed a EU ratification strategy by 2002; 
however, U.S. opposition to the treaty could delay or shift this approach.
Environmental Strategies is providing input to the Bush Administration and 
Congress on cost-effective, market-based approaches to address climate change.
Remarks by Danish Energy Minister
Danish Energy Minister Svend Auken made these remarks about ratification:
"Denmark is sending a strong signal that we still support the Kyoto Protocol, 
affirming our active contribution to protecting the environment we live in."
"It is even more important in light of the American rejection," he continued, 
"for countries that support the Kyoto Protocol to show clearly that the Kyoto 
process is continuing." 
I will keep you posted on new developments.  Please let me know if you have 
any questions.

Denmark Approves Ratification Of Kyoto Climate Treaty

05/30/2001

COPENHAGEN (AP)--The Danish parliament has approved the 1997 Kyoto
global warming treaty in a move the environment minister called a strong
signal to the U.S. administration that the ratification process will
continue despite rejection by President George W. Bush.

In an 88-9 vote late Tuesday, the parliament in Copenhagen gave its
go-ahead for European Union member Denmark to ratify the protocol when
all 15 E.U. members jointly will sign the document. No date for the
common ratification has been set.

"In light of the American government's rejection of the Kyoto agreement,
it's even more important that the countries that support it clearly
demonstrate that the Kyoto process continues," Environment Minister
Svend Auken said Wednesday by telephone.

The U.S. has been heavily criticized for its environmental policies
after Bush rejected the Kyoto treaty in March, saying the mandatory
pollution reductions would harm American economic interests and
promising to offer alternative measures.

In Kyoto, Japan, the industrialized countries agreed to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions by an average 5.2% by 2012 from 1990 levels.

Auken stressed the importance of maintaining a dialogue with the U.S. -
the world's biggest polluter - on environmental matters.

"The way forward is not to take a defensive position but to show
leadership," he said. "Without the E.U. it is difficult to imagine a
successful global climate policy that will really make a real difference
to the environment."

E.U. leaders have pledged to go forward with the ratification process
despite the U.S. rejection and say it's possible to get the necessary
approval from 55 countries.

World delegations will reconvene in Bonn, Germany, in July for another
attempt to draft details of the treaty.
