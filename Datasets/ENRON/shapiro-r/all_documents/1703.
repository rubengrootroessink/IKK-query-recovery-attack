		 Subject: Re: FW: Investor Memo - Timetable Update


Bill, the only date I have heard for issuance of a decision is July 12.  As
for the effective date, I wrote to Ann Watson and Linda Serizawa pointing
out that a retroactive suspension of DA would be extremely problematical to
ESPs and probably cause complaints to be filed by customers who had signed
in good faith.  It was then suggested that the effective date should be
subsequent to whatever date a decision is issued.  Watson responded
indicating agreement but pointing out that it was Wood, not Bilas, who was
suspending DA and that Serizawa needed to respond.  Serizawa's only response
was to remind me that the email was an ex parte contact and needed to be
filed, which I already knew, of course.  However, she did not respond on the
issue (why am I not surprised?).

By the way, the memo you discuss in your email was not attached to the
version I received.
