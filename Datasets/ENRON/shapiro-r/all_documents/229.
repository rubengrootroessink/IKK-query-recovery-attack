Kimberley, this is the material that is going to come in hard copies 
tomorrow.   I received a draft of Mr. Lay's speech today and I am now engaged 
in a substantial rewriting to include much  more Ontario content.   Final 
briefing material, to come next week, will also include  the outline of the 
speech, the final itinerary and profiles of the individuals that Messrs. Lay 
and Lavorato will be meeting in 
Toronto.
