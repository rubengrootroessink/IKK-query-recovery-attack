Rick, I am attaching a bio on Glen.  He is Trent Lott and Thad
Cochrans appointee and has done a great job at TVA.  TVA is now
without a chairman.  It is my opinion that things will move much
slower if President Bush does not appoint a chairman.  Mcculough
is the right person.  He has told me that if the president wants
to put another person as chairman after he or she is cleared
through the process then he will step down.  This process will
take six month or more.  I am told that there might have been an
offer for acting Chairman, but this would not be a good idea.  I
would appreciate any help.  Please keep me informed.  Johnny
