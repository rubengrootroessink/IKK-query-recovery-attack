Word on the street is that Becky Armendariz has her name in for PUCT 
Commissioner, again.  She currently is a consultant with KPMG with a contract 
through June that she will have to terminate.  An announcement is expected 
very soon.

Judy Walsh will be the Vice President of Regulatory Affairs at SBC.  She said 
that her goal is to make them understand that open markets work.

Jimmy Glotfelty from Calpine (formerly Gov Bush's Energy Policy Director) is 
coming closer to a decision to accept a position at DOE as Senior Electric 
Policy Advisor for Sec. Spencer Abraham.  If he accepts their offer, he will 
handle all of the electric issues throughout the U.S. for the Secretary.  
(The first stop California.)  Vice President Cheney is trying to get the 
energy policy out of the White House and  center it at DOE, EPA, and 
Department of Interior.  The report will be unveiled next Thursday.  The 
President will be briefed on Wednesday.  They are unveiling the energy policy 
plan to the public in Minnesota, Iowa and Pennsylvania.   You may already 
know most of this, but thought I would pass it on anyway.
