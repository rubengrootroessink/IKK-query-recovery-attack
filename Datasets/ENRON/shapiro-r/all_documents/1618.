You may find this interesting. A framework on the "virtuous circle" of 
contracting. It may not be very applicable to the Anglo-Saxon culture. 
However, honoring contracts should not be taken for granted in other 
geographies. There is an underlying message for the Government: if one is to 
be serious and alleviate the rationing crisis, let's start honoring contracts 
and creating a responsible contracting mindset.
