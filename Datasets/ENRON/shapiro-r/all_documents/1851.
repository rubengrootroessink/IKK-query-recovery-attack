I am pleased to announce that effective July 1st the following individuals 
have been promoted from Director to Senior Director.  

Dan Allegretti - Dan has been a leader on both retail and wholesale 
electricity issues in New England for the past several years with Enron, 
resulting in Dan currently serving as Chair of the New England Power Pool 
Participants Committee.  Dan, more importantly, has been very active, both in 
the past and during the course of this year, in ensuring that transactional 
opportunities in the New England region are fully exploited by both Enron 
Wholesale Services and Enron Energy Services.  Dan's participation in the 
United Illuminating deal has been mentioned many times, but Dan has also 
played a critical role in working with Enron Energy Services this year in 
helping to develop a national business plan for creating value through the 
delivery of retail services in partnership with municipal and privately owned 
utilities.

Robert Hemstock - Rob's participation in the development of Alberta's 
competitive electricity market and the ensuing PPA project, that has produced 
considerable value for Enron and Enron Canada has been quite notable.  Rob 
has been a leader, not only with policy makers, but also with his commercial 
counterparts in ensuring that the PPA transaction was brought to fruition 
last year.  Rob has also played a critical role in preserving the value 
embedded in that deal throughout the course of this year.  Rob's knowledge of 
both wholesale and retail issues in both the natural gas and electricity 
industries in Western Canada is unparalleled.  

Sue Mara - Sue is a warrior.  Sue has fought endlessly and courageously 
during her years with Enron in trying to ensure, against all odds, that 
retail and wholesale electricity markets work as effectively as possible in 
California while also protecting Enron's interests in that very challenging 
state.  Sue is a passionate believer in the efficacy of markets, and fights 
tirelessly for both the issues as well as the well-being of the company in 
California.

Please join me in congratulating each of these individuals on their 
significant accomplishments.
