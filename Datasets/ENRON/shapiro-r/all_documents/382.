Attached is a spreadsheets with duty rates for select countries.  The list 
contains duties for hot-rolled, cold-rolled, plate, and corrosion-resistant 
products.  The list is by no means exhaustive.  Please contact Lisa Yoho 
(5-3837) or Masha Arefieva (3-00613)in regard to the application of duties 
for specific products.  The regulatory group will continue to periodically 
update the list with products and duties currently in effect.
