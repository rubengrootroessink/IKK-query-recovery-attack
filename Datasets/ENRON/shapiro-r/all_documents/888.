All

I talked to the Trustee late Friday. They are reluctant and not intending to 
meet with anyone. The want to keep their independence although they did say 
that at this point the process has been one sided. They are, however, very 
interested in getting as much information as possible for us and others. We 
should provide them copies of all the letters that we have sent to the MTF, 
EdF,  and PWC as they have not received any of that information as of yet. 
With that we should include a cover note and points on the PIM that we have 
not covered. 

When questioned on what their role was, they explained that it was to monitor 
the execution of EdF's responsibilities, set up the auction process and 
perform the auction. They must insure that the product offered by EDF is 
reasonably coherent with the conditions agreed to with the MTF, and finally 
they must insure transparency.

On the possibilities to changes certain terms conditions in the decision. 
Their role is to ensure that the remedy as agreed is followed through (they 
have no power to ensure that the greater purpose of the remedy - i.e. promote 
competition is fulfilled). Thus any fundamental changes on conditions that 
were precisely stated in the remedy (i.e. noon notification and price level - 
stated in the confidential version of the decision) will unlikely be changed, 
on these issues we can give it a go, but I see very little probability for 
success. Other issues that have not been well defined such as the schedule, 
type of  auction (SMP vs PAB) could possibly be influenced.

Bruno,

Let's send before meeting with the Trustee a letter similar to EdF and PWC  
letters, but incorporating comments on the PIM.

Let's prepare a draft tomorrow, that we will circulate within the group.

Thanks

Pierre
