The problems I see are as follows:
1) most of the people in the room are technical people (ISO focused) and not 
familiar with PR efforts/plans.  Some have brought PR people on board, but it 
was late in the process.

2) Edison Mission, Keyspan and Morgan Stanley have always had reservations 
from day one.  All for different reasons.  Others have joined 
them...Constellation, Aquila (i'm not sure why).  

3) Some of the companies are saying different things:  Constellation on the 
one hand wants to be in "everyone's rolodex as the coalition that the press 
calls for information regarding competitive market structure in NY"  and then 
they say they don't want anyone to know they're in the coalition.  ????

4) Mirant wants to lop onto what IPPNY is doing (very small, cheap effort 
targeted at Albany and bringing on new supply).

5) Dynegy wants (given the situation) for SSK to give us messge points and 
then assignments for all of us to go meet with people as individual companies 
not as a coaltion.  (this is where I think we waste our money)

6) Budget has always been an issue if we do the SSK plan -- it's not cheap 
but it gets us the traction we're looking for.  

7) I don't think it's falling apart in the 11th hour as much as I think 
people have always had reservations and/or different views of how we would 
exist and maybe we were miscommunicating the whole time (although based on 
the materials, I thought it was pretty straightforward what we were 
considering doing all along".  

8) Maybe Howard can give you something else that I'm missing.  

9) I'll keep y ou posted.

Why the hesitation on the part of coalition members( some or all?) at the 
11th hour?
