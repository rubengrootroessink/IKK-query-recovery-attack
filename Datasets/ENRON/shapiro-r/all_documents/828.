Rick / Maureen,


Here are  additional two papers on California which could be of interest. The 
first one has been drafted by EFET (European Federation of Energy Traders, 
which we are founding members of and where Peter is the Chairman of 
Electricity Working Group). The second has been prepared by the Electricity 
Association in the UK.
