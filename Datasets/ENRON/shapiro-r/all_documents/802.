Here is the latest version of the Q&A. There are two separate documents: one 
for the customer service representatives and one for the press.  These 
documents have been reviewed and approved by Vicki, outside council, and 
others.  I have sent the customer representative Q&A under separate cover to 
Diann Huddleson and Kevin Keeney, so there is no confusion with the media Q&A.
