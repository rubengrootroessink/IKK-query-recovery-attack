Report: CA Energy Crisis Overshadows Success Of PJM 
While some may argue that California's energy woes offer a prime reason for 
placing the electric competition genie firmly back in its bottle, a recent 
case study by a global consulting group asserts that California's energy 
difficulties mask the fact that other power markets in the United States are 
not only surviving, but thriving, with the PJM market serving as the perfect 
example. 
The report by PA Consulting, "PJM - Electric Power Competition That Works," 
notes that in the wake of California's energy crisis, the future of electric 
power restructuring and deregulation in the United States is increasingly 
being called into question. The growing national debate over the fate of 
electric power restructuring is couched more and more in stark terms of "to 
be, or not to be." But PA Consulting argues that this "simplistic debate" 
presents the nation with the choice of either pushing ahead with 
restructuring and potentially facing California-like difficulties in other 
parts of the country or reverting back to a more intrusive, 
command-and-control regulatory system. 
In PA Consulting's view, limiting the national debate to these two extremes 
ignores the fact that California is not the typical model for competitive 
wholesale electricity markets. "Indeed, there are several competitive 
wholesale markets at work in the United States that differ significantly from 
California's in both structure and results." One of the most "dynamic, robust 
and successful" of these other regional wholesale electricity markets is the 
Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) market in the mid-Atlantic region, the 
study asserts. "Understanding why the PJM model has succeeded in many areas 
where the California model has failed may provide regulators, legislators and 
other interested groups with a powerful reference point in the growing debate 
concerning whether continued market reform in the electric power industry is 
in our future." 
The report notes that PJM offers an interesting example for a competitive 
market case study because it is similar in size to the California market and 
has a longer track record of spot market operations. While there are 
similarities in market size and spot market longevity, significant 
differences exist between PJM and California in terms of regulatory 
jurisdiction and market composition, according to PA Consulting. 
More specifically, the study points out that in terms of regulatory 
authority, the PJM market -- unlike California's -- overlaps the jurisdiction 
of five states and the District of Columbia. In some ways, the multiple 
regulatory jurisdictions within PJM have allowed the market and market 
operator to remain largely independent of any one regulatory authority. In 
contrast, single-state markets such as California and New York have state 
regulators and legislatures that wield considerable influence and a stronger 
sense of ownership of the market and its actions, the study adds. Some have 
argued that this control has been exerted to the detriment of market function 
and independence, while FERC has been troubled by single-state control, the 
study went on to say. 
By way of comparison, the PJM experience illustrates that, in a market 
operating across multiple jurisdictions, no single state can dictate 
conditions. In such an environment, the wholesale market will be regulated 
primarily by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, reducing the influence 
of state politics and allowing the market to adopt a broader regional 
perspective, the study notes. 
"This case study provides a powerful counterpoint to those who would like to 
turn back the clock on electric power competition," said Phillip Harris, CEO 
of PJM. "Our market model provides a blueprint for a working competitive 
marketplace that has been refined during four years of successful operation."
