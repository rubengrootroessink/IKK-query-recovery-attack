George Strong's contract with Enron expires on June 30, 2001.  Do I need to 
draft a letter thanking him for his service to Enron?  Or, should someone 
else send a letter?  Is it better to merely allow the contract to expire?  
Please advise.  

Joe is planning to attend NCSL in San Antonio in August.  He indicated today 
that he wants to attend the Southern Legislative Conference in Georgia in 
July .  I am planning to attend both of these conferences.   What are your 
thoughts?  Is it proper for me to approve reasonable travel for him, or would 
you prefer to discuss in advance?

Should we organize some type of lunch or celebration for Joe's retirement or 
transition to consultant?  

Thanks, Jean
