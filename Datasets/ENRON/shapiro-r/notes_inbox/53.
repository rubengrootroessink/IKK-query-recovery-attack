Rick,

Thanks for the note.  At this point we are "fully subscribed" on interns for 
the summer, but if your team wants to interview her and bring her on, we'll 
help make it happen.  I'll ask Traci follow up with you.

Regards,
Billy

Cindy and Richard,
I promise not to send any more resumes.

However, this woman is a very, very bright first-year MBA
seeking a SUMMER internship. For an MBA, she has a
nontraditional background. But she is serious about
business and awfully smart. Also personable and mature.

Please feel free to contact me about her.

Hope all's well.

Best,
Sandy
