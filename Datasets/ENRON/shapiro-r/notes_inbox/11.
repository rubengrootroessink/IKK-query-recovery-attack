NGA Corporate  Fellows
News from the National Governors Association's  Corporate Fellows Program


Make Your Voice Heard; Respond To NGA Survey 

June 8, 2001  

Hello, Corporate Fellows! June 1 has come and gone and we have only  received 
three responses to the survey. Many thanks to Pete Poynter of  BellSouth, 
Molly Phillips of Feld Entertainment and John Riggen of Agilent  Technologies 
for completing theirs on time. In order for us to respond  to your interests 
and to effect change in the program, we need to hear  from all of you. Again, 
I ask that you review the survey,  and a letter  and memo from  Ray that 
describes upcoming events and program improvements. Return the  survey to my 
attention no later than June 27. Our goal is to get  100 percent 
participation, so please take approximately 15 minutes and  complete the 
survey.  

On a separate note, June 15 is fast approaching. For those of  you interested 
in nominating yourselves or other Corporate Fellows for  the Steering Group, 
please do so as soon as possible. Again, complete  the nomin ation  form and 
return it to my attention. Also, if you haven't already done  so, take a look 
at the criteria for selection to determine eligibility.  

The Springtime in Washington reception was a big success. Sorry some  of you 
were not able to attend. You missed a wonderful evening of great  
conversation, good food and wonderful music - not to mention the location,  
which was one of the best. My sincere thanks to all of you who helped  make 
it a success. We could not have done it without your support. The  reception 
provided a great opportunity for our new intern, Brett Rosenberg,  to meet 
Corporate Fellows, Governors Washington Representatives, and NGA  staff. 
Brett will be with us until August 15 conducting research on a  wide variety 
of issues (including energy) that are important to the Corporate  Fellows.  

Hope all is well and that the approaching end of the legislative season  will 
find you all in good spirits.  

Regards, 
Lynn  

Annual Meeting in Providence, Rhode  Island 

As a reminder, the Annual Meeting will take place from August 4-7.  I have 
confirmed plans with my colleagues John Thomasian and Peter Wiley  to have 
the Corporate Fellows luncheon include governors chiefs of staff  and policy 
advisors. Again, I have only received one recommendation for  a luncheon 
speaker. Please complete the luncheon  speaker form with your suggestion(s) 
and return it to me as soon  as possible but no later than June 15.  

Please watch for news regarding registration for the Annual Meeting.  
Registrations this year will be done online only. The website should be  live 
on June 18. This year we will have two roundtables/task force  meetings, one 
on E-governance and the other on Growth and Quality of Life,  the chairman's 
initiative. Thom Rubel and Joel Hirschhorn respectively  will contact you 
directly regarding Corporate Fellows executives' participation  in the 
roundtables. Also, the Natural Resources Committee is planning  to have a 
discussion on biotechnology. Diane Shea, committee director,  and I will be 
working together to identify Corporate Fellows to participate  in this 
committee meeting.

Corporate Fellow Participation in Recent  NGA Meetings  

Coinciding with the unveiling of the President's energy policy report,  NGA 
sponsored an all-day Energy Policy Forum on Friday, May 18,  to inform and 
educate state representatives and other interested parties.  

Panel discussions and presentations covered a range of perspectives on  a 
number of critical and timely issues, including:  

the states and energy policy;
crafting a comprehensive energy policy;
fuel sources and production infrastructure;
energy delivery;
demand management: efficiency, conservation and price responsiveness;  and
regulating the nation's energy markets: federal and state roles.

Corporate Fellow panelists included American Electric Power (AEP), Dupont,  
Enron and ExxonMobil. Other Energy Policy Forum panelists included 
representatives  from state organizations, electric utilities, energy 
conservation and  environmental advocacy and research organizations, several 
energy-related  trade associations and a commissioner of the Federal Energy 
Regulatory  Commission (FERC). The forum presented several points of view 
related  to current and projected domestic energy supply and demand, 
deregulation,  environmental concerns, the roles of federal and state 
governments, and  anticipated effects of new energy policies on states and 
consumers. 

We appreciate the time that AEP, Dupont, Enron and ExxonMobil took to  
participate to ensure the success of the Energy Policy Forum. Many, many  
thanks. 

We further appreciate the participation of Blue Cross Blue Shield in  our May 
24 meeting titled "Making Healthcare More Affordable and Accessible  for 
Small Businesses."

Estate Tax Provision Hits State Budgets Hard 
On the heels of the Senate passing the $1.35  trillion tax cut bill, state 
officials throughout the nation geared up  to oppose the ill-timed inclusion 
of a provision in the Senate bill that  would cut states' share of revenues 
from the estate tax at a time when  most state revenue pictures are filled 
with budget cuts. Read  press release.

On July 18, NGA will host the second in a series on privacy. The  topics for
