Hello! Rick,

Last year, I worked closely with Ricardo on the reorganization of the 
electric industry, with the electricity transition team (Fox's group) and 
with regulatory summaries of various countries. 

Since February, I have been working very closely with Jos, Antonio Aguilar 
(Director EBS Mexico),  in the concession granting process, visiting 
companies and all the telecommunication companies in Mexico ( data centers, 
local loop and long haul providers, etc).  Mexico is the second largest 
telecommunications market for the United States after Canada, this represents 
a big opportunity for EBS. and Jos, Antonio has proposed me to work a 100% 
with EBS, and I would like to know how do you see this.  I already spoke 
about this with Ricardo and he told me to discuss it with you. 

On the other hand, about the Government Affairs meeting in Denver I would 
like to ask you if I should go.

Best regards, Kikumi
