Here is the Seetin e-mail.  This is actually complaining about the "Fair=20

The Hertzberg memo and a Dow Jones story are included in this memo.? A=20
summary of the primary terms of Hertzberg/Edison=01,s plan is as follows:

o???????? =01&Large=018 users of electricity (500 kw and up) would have dir=

o???????? The state created California Power Exchange was mandatory for the=

Hertzberg/Edison Plan

A Fair Plan for California

Assembly Democratic Caucus

?

What the California public believes about the energy crisis:

?

Utilities are to blame.
Out-of-state generators have made huge profits.
We need to build more power plants to keep up with demand.
Deregulation is a failure.
The economy of the state is at risk.

?

What the public wants in a solution to the energy crisis:

?

Re-regulation (restore balance to system).
Very small, if any, rate increases.
Reliability of supply (no more blackouts).
No permanent damage to environment, more emphasis on renewable sources.
Penalties for those who gouged the state.
Guarantee this won=01,t happen again.

?

Themes of the Fair Plan:

?

Federal role:? The feds have refused to obey the law to maintain fair &=20
reasonable rates.
Restore fairness:? Solutions must protect residential and small business=20
users.
Re-regulation:? Reassert our authority over California=01,s energy destiny.
Stability & Reliability:? Increase supply and keep a lid on rates.

?

?

Goals of the Fair Plan:

?

Provide customers with reliable power and stable rates.
Restore regulated utilities to credit-worthiness to enable them to resume=
=20
role of energy supplier.
Ensure that mega-users of electricity have direct access to independent=20
electricity providers to protect California=01,s economy.

?

?

Many elements of the proposed Edison MOU remain unchanged, except for:
Option to purchase the transmission system.
Re-regulates service for all residential and small business consumers.
Provides direct access to providers for mega-users above 500 kW.
Mega-users pay DRC to cover SCE debt.

?

Added elements to the MOU
Transmission option at book value.
Federal tax refund must be applied to debt.
SCE purchases net short only for residences and small businesses, if=20
necessary.
PUC retains jurisdiction over rates.
EIX provides assurance to keep SCE creditworthy.

?

?

Residential & Small Protection Plan=20
Protects 99.9% of all customers (those who never peak above 500 kilowatts)=
=20
who utilize 81.5 % of load???????????=20
Will be served by SCE through native generation, bilateral contracts=20
(including QFs) and Sunrise
Present average PUC bundled rate =3D 15.7 cents per KW hour=20
Under Fair Plan, average rate would be 14 cents per KW hour including AB1X=
=20
payments

?

Mega-Users Direct Access Plan
Mega-users peak demand 500 KW or more represent 3,600 SCE customers and 18.=
5%=20
of total load
Mega-users would gain direct access to the wholesale market

?

Mega-Users Direct Access Plan (continued)

Current average PUC rate =3D 12.98 cents/KW hour

Fair Plan average wholesale price in 2003 =3D 12 cents per KW hour

Mega-users would pay SCE=01,s $3.5 billion debt minus $400 million+ dollars=
 tax=20
refund from EIX
DRC for debt and cost of electricity fits within existing PUC rates
