VERIZON PLANS PENNSYLVANIA InterLATA BID
THIS MONTH AFTER PUC GIVES CONDITIONAL SUPPORT

Verizon Pennsylvania, Inc., plans to accept conditions that the
Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission imposed today on its
support for the company's planned application to provide
interLATA (local access and transport area) services in the
state.   The company expects to file its application later this
month with the FCC, which, under the Telecommunications Act of
1996, will consult with the U.S. Department of Justice and the
relevant state regulators before issuing a decision.  The state
regulators' role is to advise the FCC on whether a Bell company
has complied with the local exchange market-opening mandates of
the Act.

In a 3-2 vote, the PUC told Verizon that it must agree to a
permanent performance assurance plan with "self-executing"
remedies based on the New York model already accepted by the FCC.
The company also must withdraw its pending judicial challenge of
the PUC's authority to impose remedies aimed at preventing
backsliding on local exchange market-opening commitments.  The
PUC said the company must agree to increase certain penalties
from $5,000 to $25,000.  And the commission said Verizon must
agree to increase remedies for failing to provide accurate
electronic billing to competitors; the company could face
payments as high as $100,000 per affected competitive local
exchange carrier for missing an electronic billing standard.

Commissioners Nora Mead Brownell and Terrance J. Fitzpatrick
dissented.  Commissioner Brownell said, "I cannot, in good
conscience, affirm that these markets are open as envisioned
under the Act."  Both dissenting commissioners listed several
areas in which Verizon had failed to show that local markets are
open to competition.  But Colleen McCloskey, senior vice
president-state government relations and external affairs at
Verizon, said she believed those concerns were addressed by the
conditions the PUC laid out.

Ms. McCloskey noted that New York, Massachusetts, and
Pennsylvania comprise the lion's share of Verizon Communications,
Inc.'s access lines.  Verizon already is providing interLATA
service in New York and Massachusetts.  Winning approval in
Pennsylvania would mean the company is making substantial
progress toward meeting an FCC requirement for Verizon's
regaining control of Internet backbone service provider Genuity,
Inc.  Verizon spun that unit off last year as a condition of the
FCC's approval of a merger of Bell Atlantic Corp. and GTE Corp.,
which formed Verizon.

A WorldCom, Inc., spokesman told TR, "We agree with the [PUC]
dissenters.  We hope the FCC will recognize that problems still
exist and force Verizon to fix them prior to allowing it to offer
long distance."

NEW COMMISSIONER ABERNATHY SEEKS MEETINGS WITH LAWMAKERS

FCC Commissioner Kathleen Q. Abernathy, still in her first week
on the job, already is sending letters to members of Congress
seeking meetings to discuss the Commission's work.  In an
interview today with TR, she said she viewed her new role as an
interpreter of Congress's statutory mandate.  The public never
has a chance to vote for FCC Commissioners, unlike members of
Congress, she noted.

Many of the predictions and assumptions made about the pace of
technological and market change when the Telecommunications Act
of 1996 was passed were wrong, Ms. Abernathy said.  But that
doesn't mean the Act has been a failure, she added.  She cited
increasing choices for consumers as one of the positive gains
made since 1996.

The commissioner, who was director-government affairs at
Broadband Office, Inc., emphasized the importance of information
provided by Congress, industry officials, consumer groups, and
state regulators.  Despite her experience in various industry
segments, she's "not an engineer or an economist," she said.  She
appreciates organized presentations and creative ideas, she
added.

TWO ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS CHALLENGE FCC's ANTENNA LICENSING
PROCEDURES

Two environmental groups have launched an attack on the FCC's
antenna licensing process, saying the agency should assess the
"direct, indirect, and cumulative effects" before issuing new
licenses.  Friends of the Earth and the Forest Conservation
Council issued their appeal in petitions asking the FCC to deny
33 antenna license applications.

The groups say the environmental assessments prepared for those
projects fail to include the information and analysis mandated by
the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), Council of Envi-
ronmental Quality regulations, and FCC rules.  In addition,
applicants failed to meet the requirements of the Endangered
Species Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Migratory Bird Treaty
Act, the groups allege.

The companies seeking permission to build the new antennas
dismiss the charges.  They say their applications fully comply
with applicable regulations.  The environmental groups fail to
provide any specific justification or evidence against their
projects and lack standing in the proceeding, the companies say.
The groups' challenge should be raised in a formal rulemaking
proceeding, they add.

"Of course the Commission must consider and evaluate good-faith
challenges to environmental compliance," American Tower L.P. said
in defense of its plans for a Maryland antenna tower.
"Complaints as vague, insubstantial, and deficient as those in
the present petition, however, are unfair, waste already strained
compliance resources of both Commission and applicants, and can
cause serious harm to a given tower project or even to [the]
overall industry, through unnecessary construction delay and
regulatory uncertainty."

A spokeswoman for the FCC's Wireless Telecommunications Bureau
said today that agency officials were reviewing the environmental
groups' petitions.

TIA PARTNERS WITH USAID TO BOOST OVERSEAS TELECOM SALES

The Telecommunications Industry Association has signed a
memorandum of understanding with the U.S. Agency for
International Development (USAID) to help U.S. telecom equipment
vendors increase sales in developing countries.  USAID will
provide access to its "global technology network" (GTN), which
assists U.S. small and midsize companies by matching prospective
buyers and sellers.

TIA said the agreement should increase the volume of new business
leads and deals in emerging markets.  "TIA and GTN share the
common goals of promoting economic development through business
enterprise," said TIA President Matthew Flanigan.

FCC OPENS AUCTION OF VHF, LMS LICENSES

An FCC auction of 16 VHF (very high frequency) public coast
licenses and 241 location and monitoring service (LMS) licenses
opened today.  Net bids totaled $284,805 by the time bidding was
done for the day after the fourth round.  There are seven
eligible bidders in the sale.

Telesaurus Holdings GB LLC was the top bidder for in the LMS
auction, offering $158,535 for 106 licenses.  SMR Systems, Inc.,
led in the public coast auction, bidding $17,550 for six
licenses.  The licenses were unsold at two auctions in 1998 and
1999 (TR, Dec. 21, 1998, and March 8, 1999).

The technology industry last year experienced its slowest growth
rate since 1994-1995, according to a report released today by AeA
(formerly the American Electronics Association).  The
"Cyberstates 2001" report "confirms that the current high-tech
slowdown began in 2000," AeA President William T. Archey said.
"And many current indicators point to a continued slowing of
growth for 2001.  Yet despite the present economic uncertainty,
some states have flourished," he said.  The 160-page report found
that all states, except for West Virginia, experienced growth in
high-tech employment between 1999 and 2000.  For more
information, go to AeA's Web site, http://www.aeanet.org, or call
