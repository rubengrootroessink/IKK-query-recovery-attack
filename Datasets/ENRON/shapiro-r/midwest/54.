Eric and Tim -- This is a note to bring you up to date on my attempts to re=
solve the ISU/IP issue.  As you are aware, IP has threatened to impose a re=
troactive standby charge to Illinois State University, our customers, if it=
 uses its on site generation for peak shaving purposes this summer.  When I=
SU was an IP customer, the utility did not impose such charges, but noe tha=
t they have lost their PPO and have reverted to SC21 this was made an issue=
.

I spoke with Kathy Patton last week and told her the situation.  She respon=
ded to me today and indicated that a final answer cannot be given until ear=
ly next week because the VP over major accounts is out of the office.  She =
indicated that her peole said that ISU never used on-site generation for pe=
ak shaving purposesand instead used them only for back-up, hence no standby=
 service was required previously.  I told her that that was not accurate an=
d that this is a new and unwarranted change in requirements that is not sup=
ported by IP's tariffs.  I also informed her that the units are electricall=
y isolated from IP's system through a make-and-break switch system and coul=
d obviously not be served by two power sources. Further, since ISU has abou=
t 25 of these small units scattered around its campus in Normal, Illinois, =
the likelihood that a significant percentage of these units would fail and =
require IP to standby is virtually zero.  I also told her that she was in t=
he middle of this and that I did not believe that she was getting the full =
story from her people but that I was not interested in playing a blame game=
, but rather wish to avoid an unnecessary confrontation that serves nobody.=
  She agreed and indicated that she would call me Tuesday, July 3 and give =
me IP's position.  I have positioned this as a misunderstanding on the part=
 of IP's account representative.
