Below is a Motion I prepared and filed for EES to get a waiver from the PUCO limiting small commercial contracts to a 2 year term.  If granted, this will allow Enron Direct to blitz the market.  The plan is that for the first 25 MW of load that Rogers Herndon's group tries to do on a physical delivery basis in the Cinergy teritory, that the customers be the small commercial ones marketed by Enron Direct.  (The value proposition on a two year deal is very thin but four years works).
 
A similar motion filed by Strategic Energy was denied last year.  Prior to filing, I talked with several commissioners and Staff and I think our chances are reasonable (60% chance of success).  I'll keep you posted.
