Probably right, but I'm working on it.  We may be able to make an argument for pass thru to all customers which would neutralize the impact on new business and we may be able to do it without a huge effort.

Not sure I understand what you mean.  Are you referring to what ComEd is proposing or our ability to affect a change?

I am as much, if not more,  skeptical of this potential endeavor than Guy.

Janine:

Can you make sure that this increase will really only impact unbundled customers.  Since transmission prices are regulated by FERC I would think that all customers, bundled or unbundled, would be subject to any increase.

Also, can you give a time when FERC is due to rule on this issue and how long it will be, if ComEd's proposed impact passes, before transmission rates might be affected.

I would also like to know how ComEd is justifying this increase and what Enron's counter position and arguments are.

Thanks,

Guy

ComEd has filed to increase its revenue requirements from $170 mil. to $340 which will have an adverse impact on EES's book of business.  From an EPMI standpoint, they are somewhat indifferent to the increase as long as all entities are treated the same and pay the same price.  

Guy Sharfman is going to analyse the impact on our books to determine our business interest.
Donna Fulton is going to check into the time frame for the proceeding at FERC.  We have already filed an intervention.

The problem in Illinois is that we may face the same problem on transmission that we face with distribution where unbundled customers could pay more for these services than bundled customers.  Thus, in addition to being concerned about our current book, this could adversely affect our ability to attract customers with our new product.  While we do not take on the transmission risk, we still would not be competitive if our transmission rate is higher than what a bundled customer faces. 

Will keep you posted to discuss decisions and strategy once the fact gathering is completed.
