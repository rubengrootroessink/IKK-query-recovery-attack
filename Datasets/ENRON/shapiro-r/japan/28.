Rick -

	Attached for reference are two documents circulated by the APEC Energy Working Group in the run-up to the APEC leader's meeting in Shanghai.

	The first, a draft report on the Implementation of Energy Initiatives, pays lip service to member economies' progress toward the goals of enacting principles that support competitive energy markets.

	The second outlines the efforts EWG plans to take to enhance energy security in the region.  Although nothing happens quickly with this group, the plan focuses on measures to ensure the flow of oil in the region. 
	
	Short term issues include increasing the availability of oil trade data, re-evaluating oil stock piles, and examining sea lane security.  EWG's concrete plans for dealing with these are to schedule some meetings over the next year.  

	I'll continue to monitor this kind of information as it appears for action that could affect Enron's business.

Mike
