Rick, 

	For reference during our phone call, I attach the slides Mark & I used in our discussions with Joe Hirl.  Joe's preference is that the costs in the budget I forwarded separately should be split 50/50 between Enron Japan, which reports to Mike McConnell, and EPower, which belongs to John Sherriff.  

	Accordingly, the last slide in the presentation is intended to show how Mark and I will coordinate our experience on a case by case basis to address to support both operations.  The rest of the slides give a summary of the A/P environment.

	In addition to the budget and the general plan for support out here, I'd like to raise the following issues:

1.  Personnel in the region

2.  Plans for maintaining contact with regulatory personnel in Houston


Talk to you in the morning/evening.

Mike
