Om,

	Attached is a summary of the challenges to physically delivering forest products in Japan.  Briefly, its a cumbersome process complicated by the inter-relationship between industry, government, and quasi-government entities -- like most things in Japan.  

	In short, it would be possible, but time consuming for Enron to manage physical deliveries in Japan.  Let me know if you would like any more work on this issue, and I hope we'll be in touch before long.

Mike
