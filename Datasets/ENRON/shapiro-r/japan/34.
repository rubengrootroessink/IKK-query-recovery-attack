Thanks, Rick.  

	I really appreciate the time and effort you have spent keeping everyone informed,  and I'll try to catch up with you in person next Monday or Tuesday instead of bugging you on the phone now.  Unfortunately, I'll be in the air during your next scheduled call.

	Your news is not surprising, and we probably can't expect any firm direction until some bigger decisions are taken.

	There hasn't been any information available here about whether Japan is core, either.  

	In the mean time, EPower is taking a lot of Mark's time as they try to figure out how to move their generating plant projects forward.  The EGM activity has slowed down considerably, and Project Sato is stalled until they hear a good explanation, so we are also focusing on the now developing Japanese emissions policy, and finalizing some work for EIM/Forest Products.

Mike

Very little clarity from Ken Randolph and probably won't come for some time...not good from the perspective of planning or certainty. I can expand upon if you wish to call. Thanks.
