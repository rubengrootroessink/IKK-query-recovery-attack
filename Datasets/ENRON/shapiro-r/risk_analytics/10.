Colleagues:

The meeting went very well indeed, and I would like to thank the whole team very much for your support.

Here are the action items agreed upon for completion by the next proposed meeting on November 1st. 

1.	Communicate to Marchris and Paul and ask them to compile information on the three listed projects below through their contacts with the originator.  These purpose of the compiled information is to determine which project should on the tope of the list to provide regulatory coverage.  The compiled information may include the following: 
a)	Determine the nature of the generation asset (e.g., acquisition, new?etc.),.
b)	Determine the nature of the Customer (e.g. transmission customer, distribution customer, PPA)
c)	Determine the coverage of the regulatory coverage needed (which jurisdiction the transaction is subject to).
d)	Determine the different market components on which the transaction is dependent upon (e.g., which ISO, transmission system, which distribution system).
Amr and Alberto are made available to Marchris and Paul as work resource, if needed.  These information are kindly requested by October 31st, so that be subject of discussion in the Nov. 1st meeting.
