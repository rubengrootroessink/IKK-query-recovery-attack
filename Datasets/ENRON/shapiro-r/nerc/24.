Christi ,

 I  completely agree with Dave .In addition to the levels of redundancy he =
states  it is important to note that the Central Control Centers are more o=
f a communication and dispatch hub but the actual control of  the circuit b=
reakers , transformers, phase angle regulators and  voltage control devices=
(the reliability backbone) resides within the "sub control centers " of the=
 Transmission Operators like Con Edison, Florida Power &Light  etc etc..The=
 destruction of one of the major RTO control centers will not shut down tra=
nsmission lines or trip generators off line .There would be loss of communi=
cation to the region or local control centers and there may be some out of =
merit generation moves but it would not be a disaster . With the  redundanc=
y of control centers, computers ,communications and data acquisition along =
with the proper protocols and procedures the loss should  not severely effe=
ct the security or reliability of the transmission grid .This redundancy wi=
ll be an important part of the RTO development but there is no valid reason=
 to slow up the present pace of progress because of this issue.

I believe there are much more vulnerable areas within the Transmission grid=
 that NERC should be concerned about and address . I am open to continue th=
is discussion off line .   Dan =20

Christi,

The NERC statements clearly seem to indicate they feel threatened by the RT=
O formation process and EISB.

Frankly, nothing stated anywhere in the attachments hasn't already been tho=
ught out and handled by the three ISOs in the East and the CAISO as well.  =
All four of these entities have fully functional back-up facilities in othe=
r parts of their regions and NERC is fully aware of them.  I would assume E=
RCOT also has a fully functional, redundant control scheme in place as well=
.

In the case of NY there is another site physically apart from the main cont=
rol center which has a fully redundant computer and communications system. =
 They have (or used to have) plans which in the event neither center is ava=
ilable, can revert control back to the TOs (heaven forbid)  until ISO perso=
nnel can resume control of the grid.  So they have 3 sets of redundancy, in=
 addition to radio and satellite communications if necessary.

Earlier RTO West discussions all contained similar concerns and plans for r=
edundancy and the DSTAR preliminary design documents also plan on redundanc=
y.  NERCs assertion that they would "slow-down" the RTO formation process i=
s absurd (geez, it's going too slow now!!!).=20

Running distributed, synchronized computer networks is not rocket science..=
.how do the folks at NERC explain the NYSE quick recovery from a ground zer=
o attack?  There was no report of crippling loss of financial information..=
.at least that I am aware of.  Even a small operation like APX operates the=
ir systems using distributed computing and synchronized data.

For NERC to use the NIMDA virus as a specific attack on the electrical grid=
 operation and the compromising of reliability is preposterous and the resu=
lting "service denials" cited are probably refusal(s) of tags, which from w=
hat I understand, the utilities probably cause much more self-inflicted hav=
oc than this virus!

The press release you refer to just confirms NERC's position of maintaining=
 status quo.  Should we "call" NERC on these statements?  The remarks made =
in these public statements seem irresponsible.

Kind Regards,

Dave=20

Our NERC folks should be able to shed more light on why NERC is making stat=
ements that on their face look anti-large RTO (the other emails and comment=
s in these document look more like "this should be reviewed".)
Do we (and other market participants) need to have a computer systems group=
 perform a study that includes redunancy issues, etc. to counter this?  Cer=
tainly, Pat Wood and Nora Brownell's testimony to Congress indicate that th=
ey believe that large RTOs will bring more security and reliability (we hav=
e included this in our SE RTO mediation comments.)

RE: NERC Statements on Impact of Security Threats on RTOs

The attached e-mail in Microsoft Word form contains statements that NERC ma=
de during a recent meeting with members of the national press.  The stateme=
nts concern NERC's view of the implications of terrorist threats for FERC's=
 " Four RTO policy" set forth in its July 12th Order.  The statements also =
may bear upon the effort to establish a new standards setting organization,=
 particularly the possibility that NERC's responsibilities could be shifted=
 to EISB.  Also attached is an article containing the views of R.J. Rudden =
Associates, Inc. that discusses the risks associated with centralizing cont=
rol center operations.

Specifically, NERC representatives informed the press that on September 11 =
"the grid was the target of an insidious cyber attack that shut down some f=
acilities...from an information administration standpoint."  They noted tha=
t this resulted in service denials, although it is not clear whether they i=
ndicated where or how much.  This event was attributed to the so-called "NI=
MBA virus".

NERC's statements suggest a new strategy to preserve the role they've playe=
d not only in security matters, but possibly other aspects pertaining to "r=
eliability standards."  They warn against any immediate transition to fewer=
 RTOs as envisioned in FERC's July 12th Order.  Moreover, it is likely that=
 NERC will argue that, given its expertise and experience, recent events ma=
ke transitioning to a new standards organization (EISB?) ill advised. =20

It is unclear what, if any, impact all this may have on RTO development, th=
e legislative effort to establish a new reliability standards body or the N=
ERC Board's consideration of pending reform proposals at its October meetin=
g.  However, we can expect security related issues to be included in future=
 discussions of these matters.=20

Please provide your reactions to the NERC statements to Mark Bennett at 202=
-628-8200 or mbennett@epsa.org
