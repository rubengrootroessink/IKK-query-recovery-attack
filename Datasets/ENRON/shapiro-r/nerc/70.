Its my turn, sorry I havent jumped in til now, computer problems.

At a EPSA sponsored meeting on Aug 9, the GISB Chair and Rae McQuade sat do=
wn and we went through what it takes to get EISB rolling and how they would=
 tackle the tough issues at NERC.

I beleive the EPSA folks in the room, Mirant, Dynegy, Ontario Power Gen, En=
ron, Exelon, Calpine  and ELCON all felt that there shouls be one organizat=
ion setting standards because of the inherent risks of assuming reliability=
 and commercial issues can be sleanly separated.  We came away from the mee=
ting with a comfort level that the GISB process will provide the right mech=
anism to resolve this age old debate - I don't care what kind of standard y=
ou call it - if you write it - it must be put through the GISB/EISB wringer=
.  GISB recommended that perhaps what we know as NERC today could be given =
a segment in the energy quadrant.
=20
Also to respond to Sarah's note about support for an SRO - no entity in the=
 room supported that FERC give deference to ANY standards organization - no=
t NERC, NAERO, GISB or RTOs.  So I think we need to hold tight to this issu=
e and we will be able to rally support for it.

I will speak at the GISB conference next Wed, Aug 15 at DOE.  I am working =
with Mark Bennett and other EPSA folks on key principles of what EPSA wants=
 from the EISB Strawman.

I have attached notes I put together that will evolve into the statements I=
 will make on behalf of EPSA.

Please proviede me your thoughts.

Also - I agree with Dick, today, NERC is 12.5 million dollars annually, and=
 mostly utility dollars.  If we are going to push for a EISB, we have to pr=
ovide some carrot for these utilities to agree to let EISB do this.  NERC (=
and their supporters) will fall on their sword on funding and the reult wil=
l be we have 2 organizations setting standards if NERC cannot agree to beco=
me a part of the EISB process. =20

And one more thing, I don't know how much commitment Jeff Skilling feels he=
 has to the Independent Baord members, many of which he helped get seated. =
 But pushing for EISB and perhaps wrapping NERC into it as the reliability =
piece (GISB's suggestion) - may render the Independents obsolete.  I don't =
know if are wedded to them.

When all is said and done money rules and this means that the source of the=

I agree with Steve although I've articulated a different point of view at t=
imes in the recent past. The CAISO experience is the most compelling argume=
nt of all. Let's make sure this is our position...but, if there are still d=
issenting points of view, we should hear them out....But,We do need to reso=
lve this quickly. A final thought: this perspective puts us in between the =
NERC and PJM views..perhaps in an advantageous position to broker a legisla=
tive compromise.

After reading the FTC document, I am concerned that we are loosing sight of=
 the fact that the RTO is first and foremost a provider of transmission ser=
vice.  It will decide who uses the system, how it will be used, what schedu=
les will be accepted, etc.  Do we really want it to set the standards by it=
s performance is to be judged by others?  There are two tendencies to guard=
 against.  (1)  Most of these organizations are going to be not-for-profit =
ISOs in form.  There may be a tendency to use very stringent rules to minim=
ize outage risk and criticism of the RTO's management.  This could require =
the construction of facilities when they are not completly necessary.  (2) =
The opposite possiblity exists, namely, that they will adjust rules to cove=
r their own mistakes.  I think the former problem is the most likely. =20

If the RTOs take over the NERC role as suggested, then the reliability rule=
s would have to become part of the FERC tariff.  In order to judge the vali=
dity of the "reliability provisions" of the tariffs the FERC will be requir=
ed to develop expertise it does not have.  In practice NERC doesn't have th=
e expertise either.  It really resides in the members of the committees and=
 is thus derived from the industry.  By having a separate Standards Setting=
 Organization, the rules can still be established using the expertise of th=
e industry.  The SSO would propose rules which FERC would accept subject to=
 complaint.  The SSO's governance has to be fair, but I am not personally c=
oncerned about it being indepenent as long as FERC has oversight. It is the=
 service provider (the RTO) that needs to be independent.  The standards in=
 most industries are set in this way.  The power of the state to enforce th=
e rules come from commissions of various types.  For instance, the National=
 Electric Code is developed by the industry, but its enforcement is accompl=
ished by adopting it into building codes, state liscensing requirements, et=
c.  In the same way, the SSO can develop the reliability rules which are in=
corporated in FERC's requirement imposed on the RTO.  The RTO's tariff woul=
d incorporate them by reference.  If the RTOs performance violates the rule=
s or if a generator doesn't hold up its requirements, then ADR/FERC action =
can be taken to enforce.

My reason for this long message is to draw attention to the fact that the m=
ajor function of the RTO is provision of transmission service.  It should n=
ot see itself as a regulator.  The case of the CAISO is instructive, since =
they think they are above compliance with rules since the believe they are =
the guardians of the public interest.  When the service provider thinks it =
regulates to comes to believe it has a right to decide who "should" have tr=
ansmission service rather than get on with providing it.=20

Charles,

=09Attached to this message is the results of a study completed by the FTC =
at DOE's request relating to NERC and open access, dated Jan 4, 2001.  I be=
lieve this document is significant and should be considered in our ongoing =
quest for a truly independent "standards" organization.  I would point you =
to page 10, the last sentence which states, "To the extent that RTOs are im=
plemented in all areas of the country and have large geographic scope (or t=
hat FERC causes RTOs to coordinate their policies and rates that affect rel=
iability within each of the three transmission Interconnects), the need for=
 a separate reliability organization with mandatory rules may be greatly  e=
duced or eliminated.",  Interesting.....

=09=09Subject:=09Update - NERC Version of Legislation

=09=09Rick

=09=09The following discussion is to bring you up to date on the latest NER=
C activities on reliability legislation that was a subject on the weekly EN=
RON-NERC team conference call.

=09=09John Shelk explained that NERC has significantly reduced the length o=
f its proposed "Title on Reliability" so as to look more like the PJM appro=
ach.  Fundamentally, there are still major differences.  NERC continues to =
push for the embodiment of deference by FERC to the "SRO" in the legislatio=
n. =20

=09=09Given the conference call last week with John Q Anderson, Dave Cook a=
nd Jeff Skilling, we were concerned how the upcoming meeting on Aug 9 by NE=
RC stakeholders to "finalize" the NERC version would impact Jeff's request =
to speak with the Independent Board members before accepting any form of de=
ference to NERC to become the SRO (or the term we prefer Standards Setting =
Organization - SSO).

=09=09The meeting on the 9th should not interfere with Jeff's ability to pr=
esent issues to the Board.  We don't think Jeff needs to contact John Q And=
erson or any NERC members about the Aug 9 meeting.  However, for the discus=
sions with NERC, John Shelk plans to "stay the line" on the Enron position =
of keeping authority to defer to any SSO with FERC and to keep any language=
 that defers to the SSO out of the legislation. =20

=09=09Jeff should still be able to argue for key Board action items, and if=
 Enron is appeased, deference to NERC could still be given - but not throug=
h legislation, rather through FERC "comfort" that the SSO is doing a good j=
ob.  By knowing that FERC can "pull the plug" on the SSO if it is not satis=
fied, this will provide the correct incentive for the SSO to ensure that no=
 industry segment dominates the standards setting process.

=09=09I am completing a draft of issues that we want the Independents to re=
solve/address for Jeff Skilling to take to the Board.
=09=09Additionally, Andy Rodriquez and I will develop a summary of examples=
 of why NERC, in its current form, is not able to develop consensus rules t=
hat all its members are willing to comply with.  These examples should be p=
owerful arguments for John Shelk to leverage in arguments for FERC authorit=
y in the legislation. =20

=09=09We also discussed the need to shop our reliability legislation princi=
ples with Pat Wood and perhaps DOE.
