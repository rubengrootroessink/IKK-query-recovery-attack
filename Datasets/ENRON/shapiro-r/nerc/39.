Jim, 

I've tried to give you some language addressing Enron's support for other security measures and differentiating the pipeline and electric gird cases.  We can tighten up the wording later, if needed.  Hope this is helpful.  Cheers.

What security measures with regard to the electric grid does Enron support?

NERC remains in Full Alert Status.  Per the Electricity Sector Information Sharing and Ananlysis Center (ES-ISAC), suggested actions at Full Alert may include:  selected maintenance curtailment; selected additional generation reserves in various states of readiness; staffing of backup control facilities; examination of connections of computers to outside communications, including the Internet and modems; and maintenance of close coordination with first responders, local law enforcement, and the local FBI.  In case of a specific threat to the grid, operators are prepared to shut down the interface to maintain local control of transmission and to change generation dispatch patterns.  ENRON SUPPORTS ALL OF THESE ACTIONS, AS APPROPRIATE.

Does Enron's position on information flow about electric grids contradict its stance on restricting certain information about gas pipeline operations for security reasons?  

No.  Certain pipeline information that could be used to identify the physical location of assets has been restricted to those within the industry.  Pipeline information important for the operation of gas markets remains available to market participants.  The NERC action, however, restricts electric gird information even to market participants who need it in order to ensure the efficient operation of the wholesale electricity market.
