After reading the FTC document, I am concerned that we are loosing sight of=
 the fact that the RTO is first and foremost a provider of transmission ser=
vice.  It will decide who uses the system, how it will be used, what schedu=
les will be accepted, etc.  Do we really want it to set the standards by it=
s performance is to be judged by others?  There are two tendencies to guard=
 against.  (1)  Most of these organizations are going to be not-for-profit =
ISOs in form.  There may be a tendency to use very stringent rules to minim=
ize outage risk and criticism of the RTO's management.  This could require =
the construction of facilities when they are not completly necessary.  (2) =
The opposite possiblity exists, namely, that they will adjust rules to cove=
r their own mistakes.  I think the former problem is the most likely. =20

If the RTOs take over the NERC role as suggested, then the reliability rule=
s would have to become part of the FERC tariff.  In order to judge the vali=
dity of the "reliability provisions" of the tariffs the FERC will be requir=
ed to develop expertise it does not have.  In practice NERC doesn't have th=
e expertise either.  It really resides in the members of the committees and=
 is thus derived from the industry.  By having a separate Standards Setting=
 Organization, the rules can still be established using the expertise of th=
e industry.  The SSO would propose rules which FERC would accept subject to=
 complaint.  The SSO's governance has to be fair, but I am not personally c=
oncerned about it being indepenent as long as FERC has oversight. It is the=
 service provider (the RTO) that needs to be independent.  The standards in=
 most industries are set in this way.  The power of the state to enforce th=
e rules come from commissions of various types.  For instance, the National=
 Electric Code is developed by the industry, but its enforcement is accompl=
ished by adopting it into building codes, state liscensing requirements, et=
c.  In the same way, the SSO can develop the reliability rules which are in=
corporated in FERC's requirement imposed on the RTO.  The RTO's tariff woul=
d incorporate them by reference.  If the RTOs performance violates the rule=
s or if a generator doesn't hold up its requirements, then ADR/FERC action =
can be taken to enforce.

My reason for this long message is to draw attention to the fact that the m=
ajor function of the RTO is provision of transmission service.  It should n=
ot see itself as a regulator.  The case of the CAISO is instructive, since =
they think they are above compliance with rules since the believe they are =
the guardians of the public interest.  When the service provider thinks it =
regulates to comes to believe it has a right to decide who "should" have tr=
ansmission service rather than get on with providing it.=20

Charles,

Attached to this message is the results of a study completed by the FTC at =
DOE's request relating to NERC and open access, dated Jan 4, 2001.  I belie=
ve this document is significant and should be considered in our ongoing que=
st for a truly independent "standards" organization.  I would point you to =
page 10, the last sentence which states, "To the extent that RTOs are imple=
mented in all areas of the country and have large geographic scope (or that=
 FERC causes RTOs to coordinate their policies and rates that affect reliab=
ility within each of the three transmission Interconnects), the need for a =
separate reliability organization with mandatory rules may be greatly  educ=
ed or eliminated.",  Interesting.....

Kind Regards,

Dave

Subject:=09Update - NERC Version of Legislation

Rick

The following discussion is to bring you up to date on the latest NERC acti=
vities on reliability legislation that was a subject on the weekly ENRON-NE=
RC team conference call.

John Shelk explained that NERC has significantly reduced the length of its =
proposed "Title on Reliability" so as to look more like the PJM approach.  =
Fundamentally, there are still major differences.  NERC continues to push f=
or the embodiment of deference by FERC to the "SRO" in the legislation. =20

Given the conference call last week with John Q Anderson, Dave Cook and Jef=
f Skilling, we were concerned how the upcoming meeting on Aug 9 by NERC sta=
keholders to "finalize" the NERC version would impact Jeff's request to spe=
ak with the Independent Board members before accepting any form of deferenc=
e to NERC to become the SRO (or the term we prefer Standards Setting Organi=
zation - SSO).

The meeting on the 9th should not interfere with Jeff's ability to present =
issues to the Board.  We don't think Jeff needs to contact John Q Anderson =
or any NERC members about the Aug 9 meeting.  However, for the discussions =
with NERC, John Shelk plans to "stay the line" on the Enron position of kee=
ping authority to defer to any SSO with FERC and to keep any language that =
defers to the SSO out of the legislation. =20

Jeff should still be able to argue for key Board action items, and if Enron=
 is appeased, deference to NERC could still be given - but not through legi=
slation, rather through FERC "comfort" that the SSO is doing a good job.  B=
y knowing that FERC can "pull the plug" on the SSO if it is not satisfied, =
this will provide the correct incentive for the SSO to ensure that no indus=
try segment dominates the standards setting process.

I am completing a draft of issues that we want the Independents to resolve/=
address for Jeff Skilling to take to the Board.
Additionally, Andy Rodriquez and I will develop a summary of examples of wh=
y NERC, in its current form, is not able to develop consensus rules that al=
l its members are willing to comply with.  These examples should be powerfu=
l arguments for John Shelk to leverage in arguments for FERC authority in t=
he legislation. =20

We also discussed the need to shop our reliability legislation principles w=
ith Pat Wood and perhaps DOE.
