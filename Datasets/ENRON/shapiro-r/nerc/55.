This document, although lengthy, contains insight to what NERC's BOT may be asked to endorse as far as establishment of a NERC position on reliabilty standards and market practices.  It also has implications on how to split the baby between NERC and GISB.

I suggest all to review this draft and be ready to provide the MIC feedback when it appears on their agenda.  I am unsure if it will show up in the July meeting, perhaps Terry Lane of Dynegy, who is on the subcommittee that put this together can provide us with more info.

Mark, please forward this to the EPSA-NAERO group list.

Thank You
Charles Yeung

Subject:	Partial Draft of Paper for Friday's Conference Call


Attached is a partial draft of a MIPS paper addressing the process for MI and Commercial practices.  It got a little more complicated than I anticipated so it is not finished.  However, I did outline the unfinished sections so you can get an idea of how it is supposed to finish.  I will try to get it completed before the call so you can see the whole paper.  I would appreciate your comments on the call.

For the additional items that the MIPS is presenting to the MIC, please refer to Agenda Item 7 in the MIC package.  The MIC package is at following URL:  http://www.nerc.com/~filez/micmin.html
