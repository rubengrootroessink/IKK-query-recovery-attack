RE: National Energy Policy Issues

We received the attached document from Scott Miller on the OMTR staff at 
FERC.  Scott is concerned that the current discussion of a national energy 
strategy does not include a meaningful focus on critical electric issues.  
Both at FERC and with lawmakers, Scott is encouraging people to stress the 
issues identified in this paper in an effort to focus decision-makers on the 
needs of the electric industry in the current debate.  If you have any 
questions, please contact Julie Simon at EPSA, 202-628-8200 or 
jsimon@epsa.org.
