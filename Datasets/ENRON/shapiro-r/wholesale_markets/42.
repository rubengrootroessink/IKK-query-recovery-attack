The Southeast RTO:=20
The "Backstory" Behind the Press Release=20

By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis=20

[IMAGE]Owners of transmission systems across Alabama, Florida, Georgia,=20
Mississippi, and South Carolina have announced the signing of a memorandum =
of=20
understanding (MOU) to develop a regional transmission organization (RTO) f=
or=20
the Southeast. A full list of the Southeast RTO members appears at the end =
of=20
this article. Two of the largest members of this new organization are=20
Southern Company (NYSE: SO) and Santee Cooper. If the transmission owners=
=20
prove successful in their efforts to develop this transmission entity, the=
=20
RTO would be one of the nation's largest, covering more than 39,000 miles o=
f=20
transmission with an investment in assets in excess of $6 billion.=20

Analysis: The dynamics behind this announcement create a backstory that is=
=20
not readily available in the press materials being circulated by Southern=
=20
Company. However, the development of this much-anticipated RTO illustrates=
=20
how transmission infrastructure in the Southeast is assimilating, answers=
=20
questions about how Southern Company will comply with federal directives, a=
nd=20
raises speculation about possible impact on the region's already-establishe=
d=20
RTO, GridSouth. Further, as FERC has encouraged RTOs to form across the=20
country, much of the commission's focus has been placed on the Southeastern=
=20
United States (along with the West). The Southeast is dominated by large IO=
Us=20
that control massive transmission assets. Thus, seeing that Southeastern=20
transmission systems are ultimately conjoined has been a key priority for=
=20
FERC.=20

You may recall that a few months ago Southern Company applied to FERC to fo=
rm=20
its own RTO (the organization that will manage a transmission network withi=
n=20
a particular region). FERC rejected the SeTrans Gridco concept because=20
Southern Company planned to funnel certain rate incentives to companies oth=
er=20
than the RTO operator, which violated FERC policy. In addition, it is FERC'=
s=20
general policy to consolidate operating RTOs across the country, and the=20
commission was concerned that Southern Company would remain too autonomous =
if=20
it was the only utility involved in a transmission entity. Thus, FERC=20
unequivocally told Southern Company to not re-apply for RTO status until it=
=20
had explored joining forces with neighboring companies.=20

Simultaneously, FERC gave conditional approval to GridSouth, an RTO formed =
by=20
Carolina Power & Light, Duke Energy and South Carolina Electric & Gas=20
(SCANA), Southern Company's neighbors to the north. The conditional approva=
l=20
came with the instruction that GridSouth should engage in dialogue with the=
=20
SeTrans Gridco, Santee Cooper and Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) about=20
joining GridSouth. Again, FERC sent the message that it ultimately hopes to=
=20
see a single, large RTO serving the entire Southeast region.=20

Nevertheless, now Southern Company and Santee Cooper have joined forces wit=
h=20
seven other companies to form a new RTO that will be a completely separate=
=20
entity from GridSouth. I contacted GridSouth for a response regarding what=
=20
impact (if any) the formation of the new Southeast RTO might have on=20
GridSouth. However, as of press time, representatives for GridSouth had not=
=20
prepared a public statement regarding the proposed transmission entity. =20

I spoke with John Sell, a Southern Company spokesperson on June 19. Sell=20
informed me that Southern Company had indeed engaged in negotiations with=
=20
GridSouth upon FERC's directive, but determined that GridSouth was "too far=
=20
down the road" in terms of its development, and that Southern Company plann=
ed=20
on taking a different approach toward its transmission assets. For instance=
,=20
while both entities are for-profit operations, the new Southeast RTO plans =
to=20
hire an independent third party to oversee its operations. Further, althoug=
h=20
the term "Southeast RTO" is being used in the press release, Sell told me=
=20
that among the companies involved the RTO is actually being referred to as=
=20
SeTrans (the name of Southern Company's rejected entity). Sell stressed tha=
t=20
the name SeTrans was chosen only because it had been previously established=
=20
by Southern Company and should not be seen as any indication that Southern=
=20
has majority power over the RTO. In fact, the name will be changed to=20
something else later this year.=20

On a related note, one statement that I found particularly interesting in t=
he=20
press release about the new RTO is that "the companies have also made it=20
clear that the process is not being controlled by any individual transmissi=
on=20
owner, but rather all participants will help establish the rules by which=
=20
they will operate and make decisions." This is clearly a veiled reference t=
o=20
Southern Company, which was criticized by FERC for being too autonomous in=
=20
its original RTO filing. When I spoke with John Sell, he volunteered that=
=20
Southern "is not the driver behind this RTO."=20

Santee Cooper's involvement in the SeTrans RTO also came about in a somewha=
t=20
precarious fashion. As noted, FERC specifically asked GridSouth to find a w=
ay=20
to incorporate Santee Cooper, a state-owned utility located in South=20
Carolina, into its RTO. As Santee Cooper controls about 4,200 miles of=20
transmission lines covering 75 percent of South Carolina, it is no wonder=
=20
that the commission would want to make sure that the public utility was=20
conjoined in some way to developing RTOs. There was just one problem with=
=20
this plan: the South Carolina constitution prohibits Santee Cooper from=20
joining for-profit enterprises. =20

The case was closely followed throughout the energy industry as other publi=
c=20
power agencies across the country are also involved in pending negotiations=
=20
to join RTOs. New reports indicate that, if the SeTrans RTO is approved by=
=20
FERC, it will be the largest RTO in the country to include a public power=
=20
entity. However, it is important to note that Desert Star, an RTO based in=
=20
Phoenix that connects transmission assets of seven Western states, includes=
=20
the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA), which owns about one-third of=
=20
the transmission system that serves Colorado and provides power to 28 of 29=
=20
of the state's municipal electric systems. =20

Naturally, as the SeTrans RTO is also classified as a for-profit entity, th=
e=20
question has been raised of how Santee Cooper will be allowed to join as a=
=20
member given the South Carolina law. I spoke with Stephen Pelcher, associat=
e=20
general counsel of rates and regulations for Santee Cooper, about this=20
conundrum. There is an important distinction that should be understood.=20
GridSouth is a wholly owned company under its three utility parents (Caroli=
na=20
Power & Light, Duke and SCANA). The obstacle facing Santee Cooper's=20
participation in GridSouth was that the company could not be a shareholder =
in=20
a private corporation. Under the SeTrans RTO, in which Santee Cooper is now=
 a=20
participant, none of the participating companies will have ownership over t=
he=20
transmission entity. As noted, this was one of Southern Company's main=20
interests in forming its own RTO as the company intends to hire an=20
independent third party to oversee its operations. Pelcher told me that the=
=20
SeTrans RTO is still in a "preliminary stage" and thus it appears at this=
=20
time that participants in the SeTrans RTO will retain ownership of their=20
transmission assets and only turn over operational control to the independe=
nt=20
third party. Interestingly, Pelcher also told me that Santee Cooper (and, b=
y=20
extension, the SeTrans RTO) remains in consultation with GridSouth for a=20
"coordination and implementation service agreement" that would in some way=
=20
interconnect the two entities.=20

One issue that will continue to impact RTOs throughout the country is how=
=20
electricity will be transported across independent transmission systems.=20
Specifically, FERC has been concerned about how power will be traded from o=
ne=20
RTO to another and the possibility that boundaries between two separate RTO=
s=20
could become "speed bumps" in the flow of electricity. In fact, the=20
commission met this week on the issue and continues to formulate policy=20
related to these "seam issues." Part of the reason that Southern Company's=
=20
original, independent RTO plan was rejected was FERC's concern that the=20
utility was resisting efforts to form a cohesive, interconnected system in=
=20
the region. At this point, it appears that FERC favors standardization in h=
ow=20
adjacent RTOs will relate to each other, and thus has instructed developing=
=20
RTOs to consult with each other on seam agreements. FERC reportedly is=20
planning to have a formal policy on the subject ready by the end of this=20
year. Related to the development of this policy is the debate over whether =
or=20
not FERC should take a more active role in forcing consolidation among=20
developing RTOs so that only a limited number of separate entities exist.=
=20

Thus, as the SeTrans RTO continues to grow, it will need to determine how i=
t=20
will be connected to GridSouth and GridFlorida (and any other adjacent RTOs=
).=20
In addition, Southern Company's John Sell disclosed to me that the SeTrans=
=20
RTO has formed an MOU with TVA for a seam agreement. At this point, TVA has=
=20
made no announcement that it is planning to join the new Southeast RTO and =
in=20
fact, as a federal agency, is under no obligation to join an RTO.=20

The SeTrans RTO plans to file an application with FERC and is preparing for=
=20
the commission's deadline of being formed by Dec. 15 of this year. If the=
=20
SeTrans RTO (or whatever it is ultimately called) gains FERC's approval, it=
=20
will represent a significant part of the Southeast's development into a=20
functionally competitive electric market. If FERC's stated policy of=20
consolidating RTOs is effectively applied, ultimately we could see that=20
GridSouth becomes conjoined to this new RTO, which now includes Southern=20
Company, Santee Cooper and (through a seam agreement) TVA. Moreover, the=20
development of the new Southeastern RTO illustrates the complexities of=20
conjoining companies that transcend federal, state and municipal levels,=20
along with the challenges of ensuring that adjacent RTOs form synergistic=
=20
policies regarding the flow of power.=20
