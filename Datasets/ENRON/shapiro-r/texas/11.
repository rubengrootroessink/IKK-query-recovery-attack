Christi, Doug and Jean

Attached is Brad Jones' final version of the ERCOT Filing (the one labeled 
v.3).  I have also attached the copy that I sent Brad with my comments.  I 
think he did a pretty good job of incorporating my concerns. As I said on the 
reply to Thane I think we would be conspicuous in our absence from this 
filing if we don't sign on.  So far 11 entities have signaled there desire to 
sign on.  Does anybody know how many signed on to the first filing on this 
matter?  Christi, I have the instructions from Brad about where to fax the 
signature sheet - he needs it by 3:00 Friday.   What I am trying to do is to 
get the PUC Staff to understand that there is a fundamental difference 
between the way they (and us) are looking at an electricity market (ie with 
PJM glasses on) and the way that the market designers viewed things.  It has 
been clear throughout my discussions with them regarding congestion 
management that they don't understand the difference - not yet anyway, but 
they are getting better.  Once they do get a clearer picture of the 
differences they will better understand our arguments against balanced 
schedules.  With this in mind wherever possible I try to get John Meyer, Brad 
Jones, Barry Huddleston et al to articulate their philosophy more clearly - 
and the more they do that the greater our chances are.  Because, as Hogan so 
succinctly stated, their model doesn't work.  If it does...well...great.  
Anyway my recommendation is that we sign on.  Doug, although I would have 
written it differently,  I don't think the tone of the final version is 
overly critical or whining.

Please let me know what you think.  I won't be able to communicate much 
today...I'm presenting at a meeting on congestion management in SPP here in 
Dallas.

Regards, Ron
