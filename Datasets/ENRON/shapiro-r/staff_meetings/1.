This would be a good presentation for one of our quarterly meetings.  Maybe 
Lloyd or Tom would want to come to Colorado!

Christi,

Thanks for your help.  The whole services team appreciates all of your 
efforts.  I would be happy to give a brief presentation on what the Services 
Desk is doing when the regulatory group is in town for a get together.

Thanks again,

Tom.

Subject: Gov't Affairs bringing in Deals

Ginger -- Can you please forward to our North America group.  Thanks.





Some originators today reiterated how valuable Gov't Affairs can be in 
bringing deals (citing Tom Chapman -- Alamac and Dan Allegretti -UI).  The 
new East power services desk (headed by Lloyd Will and Tom May) is taking off 
and very interested in muni, industrial on-site generation purchases, 
scheduling, etc.  Origination (EPMI and EES) are interested in structured 
deals -- all requirements, tolling, etc.  Thanks for keeping this in mind 
while out there in the trenches!

Christi N.
