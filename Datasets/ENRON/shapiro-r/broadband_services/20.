Attached please find a copy of the Initial Comments that we filed last Friday 
in response to the FCC's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to create a secondary 
market for spectrum.  The attachment referenced at the end of the document 
included copies of sample Master Purchase and Sale Agreements for electricity 
and natural gas that I obtained from our in-house counsel.  

If you have any questions or concerns, please let me know.

Regards,

Lara
