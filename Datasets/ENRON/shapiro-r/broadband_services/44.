Below is a reactive statement which should help you deal with external discussions and enquiries given the decision for EBS to not have a presence in Europe going forward.


"In common with other companies operating in the broadband market, Enron Broadband Services is taking further steps to consolidate its business to match the size of the foreseeable business opportunity. 

Poor demand for broadband services is being exacerbated by falling prices, requiring Enron to consider the best options for managing its global broadband business. 

During the next six months the European operations of EBS will be transferred from London to Enron's headquarters in Houston, where the company is well placed to manage the on-going requirements of customers around the world."
