Re:        Enhancing the Leadership  
Rick, 
I have prepared the attached as possibly helpful to  "enhancing the 
leadership." 
I am sorry this was so long in coming -  I dropped the ball on this before I 
took vacation  - then discovered my  error when I returned. 
I'll call to follow up. 
Thanks.
