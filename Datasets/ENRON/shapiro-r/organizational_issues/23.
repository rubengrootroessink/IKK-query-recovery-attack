The Government Affairs group communicates Enron's interests to government 
officials and policymakers in multiple countries throughout the world and at 
all levels of government - multinational, federal, state, and local.  
Our mission is four-fold:  
(1) advocate through administrative, political, and regulatory channels 
Enron's vision for competitive and open markets in the energy and 
telecommunications industries, 
(2) support deal teams in securing the necessary regulatory approvals and 
permission for complex transactions, 
(3) manage all global regulatory risk inherent within our business dealings, 
and 
(4) develop innovative opportunities for Enron's businesses.
