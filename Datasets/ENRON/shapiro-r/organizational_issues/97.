FYI.  It looks like we can move ahead with Karen in a temporary assignment,=
 without her losing anything in the transition package offered by EBS.  How=
ever ... it may be more difficult to move her to the analyst position than =
we thought.  She is listed in peoplefinder as a senior admin., but she is a=
ctually a number of pay levels below that ... .

Paul -- please review and let me know if you'd like to make any revisions. =

Karen -- as you are aware, your current position as Administrative Assistan=
t to Scott Bolton will be ending as of Monday, October 1st, at which time y=
ou are scheduled for 45 days of redeployment.  As an alternative, the follo=
wing option is being proposed:

Due to the resignation of the Administrative Assistant in the Portland Gove=
rnment Affairs office, Paul Kaufman and Alan Comnes have an immediate need =
for an Administrative Assistant.  We are also aware of your desire to advan=
ce into a professional level position within the Government Affairs group. =
 In order to meet the objectives of both the office and your goals, we woul=
d like to extend you the opportunity to work as the administrative assistan=
t in the group for an initial 31-day assignment.  During this period (Octob=
er 1-31), you will fill the administrative needs of the department in addit=
ion in allowing Paul to perform an evaluation of your skills and growth pot=
ential into a professional role in Goverment Affairs.  At the conclusion of=
 this assignment, if there is not a continued opportunity for you to contin=
ue to work in the administrative assistant's role with the potential of fut=
ure growth into a professional level position, you will then be allowed to =
enter into your 45-day redeployment period. =20

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding this option or would=
 like to discuss further.  I can be reached at
713-853-0363.  Please let me know your decision no later than _____________=
