Rick - here goes for a draft announcement.  I've written it as coming from Michael, but it should be easily amended if the sender differs.

"I am pleased to announce some organisational changes to the European Government and Regulatory Affairs Group.  Paul Dawson will become head of the group taking responsibility for government and regulatory affairs across continental Europe in addition to his current UK responibilities.   Paul will report directly to myself and will be strongly supported by the other senior members of the team: Doug Wood (Continental Gas), Peter Styles (EU and Continental Power) and Paul Hennemeyer (German speaking countries).  Richard Lewis and Eric Shaw will continue to work closely with the group with Rick Shapiro continuing to provide the team with strategic guidance to ensure that the European Government Affairs group is fully integrated within the global government affairs function.

I believe these changes will enable us to maintain Enron's leadership in regulatory efforts to broaden the markets available to us, to capitalise on regulatory changes and to continue the group's major contribution to our commercial success in the UK and Continental Europe

etc

Michael Brown"

Hope this is OK for a general announcement - not sure there is much more to say to the wider audience without dwelling on justifications and the finer points of how the respective responsibilities will pan out.  Clearly, however, a bit more explanation will be required for some individuals and the team as a whole.

Let know if you manage to get hold of Michael, re, my telling Doug.  If possible, I'd like to be able to discuss this with him sooner rather than later.

Paul
