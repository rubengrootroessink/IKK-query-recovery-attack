Subject: Changes at EBS

Date:  July 12, 2001

Since its inception, EBS has seen dramatic changes in the communications=20
industry.  The growth and opportunity anticipated in this industry two year=
s=20
ago has significantly changed in the past nine months.  While Enron remains=
=20
committed to extending our business model into telecom, we need to quickly=
=20
respond to these changes in the market to achieve our objectives.

The Enron Corp. earnings release issued today states that we will be=20
adjusting the EBS business to better match the revenue opportunities.  This=
=20
means that we must reduce our overall cost structure and better focus our=
=20
commercial efforts.

To achieve this, we will take the following steps:

EBS will become a business unit within Enron Wholesale Services.  This will=
=20
involve the integration of all EBS commercial support functions into those=
=20
units within EWS, and will enable us to better manage the resources and cos=
ts=20
of the support functions.

All EBS commercial functions will be consolidated into the following units:

Europe =01) headed by Matthew Scrimshaw
Asia =01) headed by Anthony Duenner
Americas =01) headed by Rich DiMichele
We will consolidate the North American EBS origination teams into one group=
,=20
led by Stewart Seeligson. =20
North American trading and risk management will continue to report to Paul=
=20
Racicot.  Paul will also oversee the global portfolio from a risk managemen=
t=20
perspective.

Global Network Operations will continue to report to the EBS Office of the=
=20
Chairman.

All EBS asset positions will continue to be reviewed and repositioned to mo=
st=20
effectively meet the future needs of EBS.

The Portland office will be closed by October 1.  Portland employees will b=
e=20
advised by their supervisors of their relocation or redeployment status by=
=20
July 27.

These changes will affect many EBS employees through relocation,=20
redeployment, severance or movement to another part of Enron.  We have not=
=20
yet worked out all of the details of these changes, but your supervisor wil=
l=20
apprise you of how this affects you as soon as possible, and no later than=
