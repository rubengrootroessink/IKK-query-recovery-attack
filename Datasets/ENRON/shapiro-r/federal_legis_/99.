Yesterday I spent about 45 minutes with the three key energy staff to the H=
ouse Energy and Commerce Committee -- Andy Black (for Barton) and Sean Cunn=
ingham and Jason Bentley (the energy counsels to the full committee).  We m=
et at my request to discuss Barton RTO draft.  (The group EPSA meeting with=
 Chairman Barton that was to have been yesterday afternoon has been resched=
uled for next Tuesday.)
=20
Key points from the meeting --
=20
1.  They do not expect the Barton Subcommittee to mark up the electricity l=
egislation this year.  Time is running out and Members of the subcommittee =
are not focused on the issue.  Instead, they plan to continue working on th=
e issue at the staff level.  Probably will be another draft version circula=
ted and then a version will be introduced by Barton as a formal bill by the=
 end of the year. The earliest they see any kind of vote is late Jan. or ea=
rly February.
=20
2.   Barton feels strongly that FERC should not be the "tail wagging the do=
g" on RTO policy.
=20
3.   On particulars of the bill, they are clearly reconsidering the 40,000 =
MW minimum threshold for the size of an RTO.  They are getting pulled in bo=
th directions, they say, and are inclined to drop the 40,000 MW number -- p=
ossibly leaving it to FERC to set a number.  They conceded that the mechani=
cs of the draft make it unlikely that the 18 month "deadline" for all trans=
mission owners to get into an approved RTO would stick.  They consciously c=
hanged the normal judicial standard of review for FERC actions from "arbitr=
ary and capricious" to "preponderance of the evidence" because they think o=
therwise the courts will rubber stamp FERC.  Spent a lot of time on how the=
 draft would aid and abet the recalcitrant utilities and that the overall n=
ature of the draft assumes there are only two parties to this -- FERC and t=
he transmission owners -- while the rest of those truly affected -- from us=
 to others -- are left out.  Sean said we could still intervene, but I said=
 that was the truly pro forma aspect of their process since FERC's hands an=
d our's would be tied by the "rights" given to transmission owners to drag =
their feet.
=20
Bottom line -- FERC has a window until next Spring without likely congressi=
onal interference, at least not of the formal, legislative variety, to both=
 move on RTOs and improve its relations with Congress.  FERC staff has been=
 pushing the committee staff on concerns similar to our concerns.
