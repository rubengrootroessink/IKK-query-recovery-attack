Steve and Rick:  I attempted to strengthen the latest draft of the 
Stakeholder letter per your instructions on our most recent conference call.  
Unfortunately, we have pushed to the point that APPA, the consumer groups and 
most utilities will no longer sign the letter per their e-mail below.  It now 
looks like no letter will be sent.  If you would like, Enron, EPSA, ELCON and 
ACC only can send a revised stronger letter or alternatively, just bag the 
idea.  The utilities are split not wishing to let APPA appear more reliable 
then them.  I will forward the MidAmerican letter for your files which does 
support our position per my request.  I feel it is unfortunate that now APPA 
will send a strong support letter instead of signing our modified version.   
Per his request, I will meet with Congressman Wynn's Chief of Staff next week 
upon his return from vacation to discuss their strategy.   thanks.

Subject: Stakeholder Reliability Letter


While we have been actively involved in the editing process for a
stakeholder letter on reliability, I am writing to let you know of growing
concern among APPA's membership that the draft stakeholder reliability
letter still does not go far enough in representing our association's
position in support of stand-alone reliability legislation in the absence of
a comprehensive restructuring measure.  While we know the draft was intended
only to be kept in our "back pocket" for use if needed later in the session,
we would not be able to endorse sending the letter in any event unless it
was substantially strengthened to directly indicate support for a
stand-alone reliability measure.  Because it has become clear during the
editing process that the group cannot arrive at consensus on that point, we
would like to suggest that the group opt not to send such a letter, but
instead have our individual organizations write their own letters that more
accurately reflect their support or opposition on the question of
stand-alone reliability.  Thank you for your consideration.  Jane.
