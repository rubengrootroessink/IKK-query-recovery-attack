Re-read your reply.   Just wondering what it means to possibly add a provision, which I understand is a "may" -- dealing with FERC's authority to change existing RTOs.  Depending on what that means, it could seriously hamstring FERC's efforts for a 4-5 RTO model as sought and we support, by not letting FERC change "existing RTOs" (particularly if that includes pending, but not approved) to change.  For example, would the language under consideration block a Northeast RTO of PJM, NY and NE since PJM is "existing" and NY has filed?  What would be the rationale for such a serious limitation on FERC's authority?  Thanks.

He spoke yesterday to that group.  I do expect participation in an RTO to be mandatory, but there may be provisions dealing with FERC authority to change existing RTOs.

Ran into a fellow Texas company lobbyist who said that the Chairman 
today is speaking to EEI CEO Conference you mentioned and he was going 
to release the bill or at least say the bill would include mandatory 
RTOs.  Just checking out the rumor.  Thanks.
