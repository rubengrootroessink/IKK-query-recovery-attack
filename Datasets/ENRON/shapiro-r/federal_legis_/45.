See e-mail exchange between Andy Black of Barton staff and me (below).  Seems to confirm what he told me a few weeks ago -- and rumor that Barton told EEI yesterday at their CEO conference -- that his draft will make RTOs mandatory.

He spoke yesterday to that group.  I do expect participation in an RTO to be mandatory, but there may be provisions dealing with FERC authority to change existing RTOs.

Ran into a fellow Texas company lobbyist who said that the Chairman 
today is speaking to EEI CEO Conference you mentioned and he was going 
to release the bill or at least say the bill would include mandatory 
RTOs.  Just checking out the rumor.  Thanks.
