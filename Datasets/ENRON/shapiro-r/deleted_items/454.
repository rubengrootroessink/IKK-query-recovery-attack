Rick:  If the business guys are keen on cutting costs, this may be one area of discussion.  Maggy and I have met cordially with Competitive Analysis on several occasions, and asked that we avoid duplication of efforts.  I know this group has its own sources, and have been a good "data point."  However, these types of summaries clearly fall within GA, and having a special "source" is of no value (especially since I sent Maggy to the vote at the ITC).  I get the feeling that  they are more interested in "scooping" us than adding value in ways that we cannot.
