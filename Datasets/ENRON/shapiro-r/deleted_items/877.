TELECOM REGULATION
************************************************************
IXCs, BUSINESS USERS TEAM
ON PLAN FOR USF COLLECTIONS

AT&T Corp., WorldCom, Inc., and two groups representing business
users of telecom services have submitted a proposal to overhaul
the "broken and unsustainable" system governing how carriers
recover Universal Service Fund contributions from their custom-
ers.  But the proposal for a flat USF fee on every telecom
connection is likely to face opposition from incumbent local
exchange carriers and others.

Earlier this year, the FCC began looking at a variety of possible
changes to the way it collects USF contributions.  Among the
possibilities raised in the Common Carrier docket 96-45 proceed-
ing was whether contributions should be collected through flat
fees on customer bills rather than through fees based on inter-
state revenues.

The proposal now being floated by AT&T, WorldCom, the eCommerce
Telecommunications Users Group, and the Ad Hoc Telecommunications
Users Group would allow for collection of USF contributions
through flat fees on customers' bills.  Residential and single-
line business customers for wireline services would pay $1 per
month per line; residential and business wireless customers also
would pay $1 per month.  Assessments for pagers would be 25 cents
per month.  

Multi-line business customers would cover the remaining USF
needs.  Under an "interim step" proposed to take effect Jan. 1,
2002, those needs would be calculated by taking the estimated USF
funding required for 2002 and removing the amount covered by the
other line charges.  The remainder would be recovered from multi-
line businesses with a per-line charge.  

A "permanent solution" that would take effect one year later
would create three levels of per-line fees for multi-line busi-
ness customers.  Customers with a facility capacity of less than
1.544 megabits per second would pay the "level-1" USF charge,
customers with a capacity of between 1.544 Mbps and 45 Mbps would
pay five times that amount, and customers with higher capacity
facilities would pay 40 times the level-1 charge.  

The basic level-1 charge would be set at the appropriate level to
cover the remaining funding needs of the USF.  The group said the
one-year interim period would allow carriers to develop the
systems they need to develop the "capacity-based assessments" on
multi-line business customers.

During a conference call with reporters this afternoon, Joel
Lubin, AT&T vice president-federal government affairs, said the
current system was not competitively neutral.  Customers of long
distance carriers pay for about 75% of the USF, he said, while
customers of local telephone companies and wireless carriers pay
dramatically less.  With USF funding needs increasing and long
distance revenues lagging, the current system can't be sustained,
Mr. Lubin said.  So long distance carriers want the system to be
based on "connections, not customers," he said.

The proposal is similar to one submitted by WorldCom in its
initial comments in the proceeding.  The groups represented in
the current coalition came together after the comments were filed
with the FCC in June and they submitted their proposal to the FCC
earlier this month.

Incumbent LECs have opposed flat-fee proposals in the past.  This
proposal appears to be no exception.  Lawrence E. Sarjeant, VP-
regulatory affairs and general counsel at the U.S. Telecom
Association, said a per-line charge was an "an unlawful way to
collect carriers' contributions" to the USF.  "It fails to
satisfy the requirement for a competitively neutral support
mechanism," he said.

"Every service provider benefits from the fund and every provider
should share the responsibility for contributing to the fund,"
Mr. Sarjeant said.  "The large IXCs' effort to change the univer-
sal service contribution mechanism is simply an attempt to fatten
their bottom lines at the expense of other telecommunications
carriers." -- Brian Hammond, bhammond@tr.com

SBC's InterLATA BID WINS APPROVAL
BUT RAISES QUESTIONS ON DSL RESALE

SBC Communications, Inc., has won the FCC's approval to offer in-
region interLATA (local access and transport area) services in
Missouri and Arkansas, although questions raised about SBC's DSL
(digital subscriber line) service resale efforts have prompted
the Commission to promise a new proceeding to look at unresolved
DSL resale issues.

SBC now has authorization to offer in-region interLATA services
in each of its original five states -- Arkansas, Missouri, Texas,
Oklahoma, and Kansas.  The FCC found that it had met the 14-point
"competitive checklist" of market-opening steps outlined in
section 271 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.  Bell operat-
ing companies must meet those requirements before being cleared
to offer in-region interLATA services.

One area of controversy in the proceeding involved SBC's compli-
ance with one of those 14 points -- provision of wholesale
services to resellers.  Section 251(c)(4) of the 1996 Act re-
quires incumbent local exchange carriers to provide services at
wholesale rates to resellers.  The services subject to the resale
mandate are telecom services that an incumbent provides at retail
and to subscribers that aren't telecom carriers.

Some commenters told the FCC that SBC had failed to comply with
the resale mandate as it pertained to DSL services.  They said
SBC, in combination with its Internet service provider affiliate,
offered DSL service on the retail market and, therefore, should
make the underlying DSL transport component available to competi-
tive local exchange carriers (CLECs) for resale.

The FCC, however, said "neither the Act nor Commission precedent
explicitly addresses the unique facts or legal issues raised in
the case."  The FCC hasn't addressed a situation in which an
incumbent only offers DSL as part of an Internet access service
rather than as a standalone retail product, it said.

"We expect that how we decide questions about the regulatory
treatment of the underlying transmission facilities provided by
incumbent LECs to their affiliate information service providers
could have far-reaching implications for a wide range of issues
that would be more appropriately handled separately," the FCC
said.

"Accordingly, because Commission precedent does not address the
specific facts or legal issues raised here, we decline to reach a
conclusion in the context of this section 271 proceeding," it
said.  Instead, the FCC said it would initiate a proceeding by
year-end and would "endeavor to complete the proceeding as soon
as possible next year."

Some Commissioners appear to be leaning SBC's way on the issue. 
Commissioner Kathleen Q. Abernathy wrote separately to address
the "difficult and complex questions" regarding SBC's DSL resale
obligations.  She said the FCC "appropriately concludes" that the
FCC can't find SBC in violation of the resale requirement because
it has "never held that an incumbent LEC's DSL Internet access
service -- as opposed to a distinct end-user DSL transport serv-
ice -- is subject" to the resale obligation.

Based on the "current record and existing precedent, it appears
that SBC's end-user Internet access service does not entail
provision of a telecommunications service at retail and, there-
fore, that SBC is not required to make that service available for
resale under section 251(c)(4)," she wrote.  "I note that my
analysis of this question is not free from doubt, and both I and
the Commission may adopt a different approach in the future based
on a fully developed record."

FCC Commissioner Kevin J. Martin made similar comments in his
separate statement.  "While the Commission may ultimately address
this issue in more detail, those who argue that this high-speed
Internet access service provided to end users should be subject
to section 251(c)(4) must show how, in light of [Commission
precedent], this is a `telecommunications service' being offered
at retail," he wrote.

FCC Commissioner Michael J. Copps called the ruling the "closest
of close calls."  He said the DSL resale proceeding "could
conceivably lead to changes in the implementation of the majority
decision to authorize SBC to provide" interLATA services in
Missouri and Arkansas.

"I am seriously troubled that, for small business and residential
customers, SBC does not make available for resale pursuant to
section 251(c)(4) any DSL service offerings," Mr. Copps said. 
"The need to resolve these issues soon in the separate proceeding
is made even starker when one considers the harmful impact of the
failure to provide such an offering."  He worried that ILECs
could use the "loophole" to limit the availability of other
services for resale

Meanwhile, Qwest Communications International, Inc., chimed in to
say that its wholesale service performance is "comparable or
better on key performance measures" than SBC.  Steven Davis, Qw-
est's senior vice president-policy and law, said his company's
"overall level of performance is already as good or better in our
14-state region. . .than SBC's successful filings."  That shows
that "we're close to successfully reentering the long distance
business in our region," Mr. Davis said. -- Brian Hammond,

INDUSTRY COALITION PROPOSES
ULTRAWIDEBAND REGULATORY REGIME

An industry coalition has proposed a regime it says the FCC
should use for regulating ultrawideband (UWB) devices.  The
proposal includes prohibiting commercial UWB devices between 1
and 6 gigahertz.

In a Nov. 15 letter to FCC Chairman Michael K. Powell, the group
suggests that the Commission regulate UWB devices using the
following categories:  ground-penetrating radars, automotive
collision radars, communications devices, experimental devices,
and future categories of devices.

The letter was sent on behalf of 22 aviation, wireless, satel-
lite, and Global Positioning System companies and trade groups,
including the Air Transport Association of America, American
Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, Lockheed Martin
Corp., U.S. GPS Industry Council, Nokia, QUALCOMM, Inc.,
WorldCom, Inc., Sirius Satellite Radio, and XM Satellite Radio.

The coalition proposed that the FCC (1) permit UWB ground-pene-
trating radar applications below 1 GHz, (2) permit UWB communica-
tions devices between 6 and 12 GHz and automotive collision radar
devices between 17 and 24 GHz, (3) prohibit commercial UWB
devices between 1 and 6 GHz, (4) limit out-of-band emissions so
UWB devices don't interfere with incumbent systems, (5) develop
an "expedited" UWB licensing scheme, (6) seek public comment
before adopting new regulations, and (7) permit experimental UWB
device use under the FCC's current rules.

The coalition also renewed its call for the FCC to adopt a
further notice of proposed rulemaking in its proceeding in
Engineering and Technology docket 98-153.  UWB companies say a
further notice is unnecessary.  FCC officials have said they plan
to take action in the proceeding by year-end.

UWB companies have maintained that the devices would be able to
operate between 1 and 6 GHz without causing harmful interference
to existing systems.  But UWB marketers have expressed some
willingness to compromise to address the concerns of other
spectrum users.  For example, in a Nov. 16 ex parte filing, one
such company, Time Domain Corp., said it would support restrict-
ing the eligibility of operators of outdoor tracking and radar
below 6 GHz in an effort to reduce the number of users. -- Paul

`C' BLOCK AUCTION BIDDER
MAY CHALLENGE NextWave DEAL

A company that participated in the 1996 "C" block auction involv-
ing NextWave Telecom, Inc., said today it might file a court
challenge to the settlement involving NextWave, the U.S. govern-
ment, and other carriers.

Will Yandell, chief executive officer of Memphis, Tenn.-based
Eldorado Communications LLC, complained that the settlement
"effectively undercuts the integrity of the Commission's auction
process and the evenhanded application of the FCC rules." 
Stephen Roberts, Eldorado's managing director, told TRDaily the
company could challenge the settlement in court.  "We think there
can and should be remedies for the guys who follow the rules," he
said.

Eldorado won three licenses at the C block auction but later
returned them because it said NextWave had pushed the prices for
the spectrum up too high.  On Nov. 7, the company filed an
emergency petition with the FCC asking the agency to halt all
private settlement negotiations (TR, Nov. 12).  It argued that
the negotiations violated FCC rules, the Administrative Procedure
Act, and constitutional due process guarantees.

On Nov. 16, the company filed a Freedom of Information Act
request seeking all documents and data related to the FCC's
participation in the settlement.

Under the settlement announced Friday, the U.S. government would
get about $10 billion, NextWave would walk away with about $5
billion, and carriers that bid on NextWave's licenses at an
auction earlier this year would get the spectrum (TR, Nov. 19). 
The parties are seeking legislation that would codify the agree-
ment and direct courts to handle any challenges in an expedited
manner. -- Paul Kirby, pkirby@tr.com

TELECOM BUSINESS 
************************************************************
GLOBAL CROSSING WILL GET $360M
FROM SALE OF IPC TRADING SYSTEMS

Global Crossing Ltd. bought IPC Communications, Inc., last year
because it needed customers.  It now is selling a large piece of
IPC because it needs cash.  But the $360 million generated by the
sale of IPC Trading Systems won't even fund Global Crossing
through 2002, according to one financial analyst.

Bermuda-based Global Crossing needs to collect $400 million
through the sale of "noncore" assets just to get through next
year, said Frank J. Governali of Goldman Sachs.  "Asset sales may
get Global Crossing through 2002, but under our revised assump-
tions the company will be in breach of its existing bank cove-
nants. . .The company is currently in discussions with the banks
to work out new covenant terms.  This is a critical piece of the
puzzle for Global Crossings's survival."

An investment group led by Goldman Sachs Capital Partners 2000
has agreed to pay cash for IPC Trading Systems, which provides
desktop units used by securities traders.  Global Crossing paid
$2.1 billion in stock for IPC in mid-2000.  The trading system
part of the business at that time was generating more than half
of IPC's revenue.  The remainder came from IPC's private networks
and Web-hosting operations.

Global Crossing acquired IPC to gain applications and users for
its global wholesale network.  IPC and its IXnet, Inc., subsid-
iary had a large customer base in the financial services market,
which was one of the vertical markets that Global Crossing was
targeting.

Included in the sale of IPC Trading Systems are its Asia-Pacific
assets, which Global Crossing transferred in July to its affili-
ate, Asia Global Crossing Ltd.  Global Crossing and Asia Global
Crossing will remain the preferred provider for IPC Trading
Systems's telecom needs, the companies said.  They didn't dis-
close how much revenue that business might generate for Global
Crossing.

Global Crossing also is attempting to sell Global Marine Systems,
an undersea cable construction business that it bought from Cable
& Wireless plc in 1999 for $885 million in cash and assumed debt. 
"The divestiture of IPC, as well as other noncore assets such as
Global Marine Systems, will strengthen our focus on becoming one
of the world's leading telecommunications service providers and,
at the same time, improve our company's cash position," said John
Legere, chief executive officer of Global Crossing and Asia
Global Crossing. -- Tom Leithauser, tleithauser@tr.com.

MOTOROLA OFFERS $260M FOR OPTICAL GEAR MAKER -- 
Motorola, Inc., has agreed to pay $260 million in stock for
Synchronous, Inc., a developer of optical networking equipment. 
Motorola said the acquisition would bolster its suite of products
for cable TV system operators.  Synchronous offers products that
"greatly increase the efficiency, quality, and distance of
signals sent over fiber-optic cable," Motorola said.  Synchro-
nous, of San Jose, Calif., will become part of Motorola's broad-
band transmission network systems unit.  The companies expect to
complete the transaction in late 2001 or early 2002.

CYGNAL TECH. 3rd QTR REVENUES UP, TO $44.4M -- 
Cygnal Technologies Corp., which designs and manages broadband
and telecom networks, posted third quarter revenues of $44.4
million versus $31.6 million in the year-ago quarter.  Net income
for the most recent period also grew to $1.1 million from
$389,000 last year. 

BARAK 3rd QTR REVENUES UP, TO $40.7M -- 
Barak I.T.C., an Israel-based international telecom services
provider, generated $40.7 million of revenue for the third
quarter, up from $27.2 million in last year's comparable quarter. 
EBITDA (earning before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amorti-
zation) grew to $7.5 million in the most recent quarter from $0.9
million last year.

I-LINK 3rd QTR REVENUES UP, TO $27.1M -- 
I-Link, a provider of Internet telephony, said third quarter
revenues grew to $27.1 million from $5.5 million in the compara-
ble quarter last year.  Net loss for the most recent period shot
up to $20.5 million from $6.8 million last year. 

AVERY COMM. 3rd QTR REVENUES UP, TO $12.4M -- 
Avery Communications, Inc., a provider of billing and customer
care services for telecom service providers, reported third
quarter revenues of $12.4 million, up from $9.6 million in the
comparable period last year.  Net losses after write-offs for the
most recent quarter were $1.9 million versus a profit of $149,000
last year.

MOBILE PHONE SHIPMENTS DOWN 9% IN 3rd QTR -- 
Worldwide mobile phone shipments in the third quarter of this
year fell 9% from last year's comparable period, according to new
figures from Dataquest, Inc.  The research firm blamed the
widespread economic slowdown and delays in the availability of
GPRS (general packet radio service) terminals for the drop in
shipments.  Nokia accounted for 33.4% of the 94.4 million phones
shipped in the third quarter.  Of the top-five producers of
mobile phones, Nokia, Motorola, and Samsung managed to improve
market share year-over-year.  Ericsson and Siemens lost market
share during the period.

BT GROUP COMPLETES mm02 SPIN-OFF -- 
British Telecommunications plc announced completion of the spin-
off of its mm02 plc mobile phone unit, and stocks of the two
firms began trading independently.  In late afternoon trading on
Monday, mm02 shares were trading at $11.95 each, and BT shares
were at $42.28, up $3.06 on the day.

BRIGHTSTAR FORMS WIRELESS DATA UNIT -- 
Miami-based Brightstar Corp. has formed a Global Wireless Data
division.  It will be headed by John Althoff, a former vice
president at Ericsson Mobile Phones.

TELECOM MAKES TOP-10 CONSUMER GRIPE LIST -- 
Consumer complaints about telecom companies and other utilities
landed on the top-10 list of the National Association of Consumer
Agency Administrators and the Consumer Federation of America's
10th annual survey.  Appearing on top-10 list for the first time
were consumer complaints about the Internet.  NACAA member
agencies said the biggest increase in complaints in 2000 were
about utilities (with an average increase of 52%) and the Inter-
net (with an average increase of 128%).  Among the specific
Internet complaints, problems with Internet service providers
(ISPs) came in third, just behind problems with merchandise and
auctions.  Several NACAA members called for additional enforce-
ment in the area of telecommunications.  They offered the follow-
ing suggestions: (1) Give consumer protection agencies more
authority to prosecute providers of wireless and wireline tele-
phony and cable TV service for unfair business practices; (2)
Adjust regulations to level the playing field between incumbent
local exchange carriers and new entrants; and (3) Provide for
state and local regulation of cell phone providers.

VERIZON FILES FOR $5B DEBT SALE,
ON HEELS OF HOT AT&T DEBT OFFERING

Verizon Communications, Inc., today filed papers with the Securi-
ties and Exchange Commission for a proposed offering of up to $5
billion of debt securities.  Verizon's latest funding move came
on the heels of a hugely successful debt offering last week by
AT&T Corp., rock-bottom interest rates, and a deep list of
Verizon funding needs stretching into 2002. 

Today's SEC filing by Verizon and its Verizon Global Funding
Corp. unit were for a debt shelf offering of up to $5 billion. 
Once approved by the SEC, some or all of that amount of securi-
ties can be sold by the company on an ongoing basis.  According
to the SEC filing, Verizon may use proceeds from a sale to repay
short-term debt and for unspecified "general corporate purposes."

As for market demand, Verizon's timing hardly could be better. 
Last week, AT&T Corp. went to market looking to peddle a $5
billion debt offering and came back with proceeds of $10.1
billion on big demand from both sides of the Atlantic.

Under current conditions, Verizon should receive at least as warm
a reception, bond traders told TRDaily.  "Any good paper at all
is going to get bought up," commented one trader, who explained
that continuing woes in the high-yield corporate bond market and
a recent tightening of spreads on U.S. Treasury debt has created
demand for higher-grade corporate debt.

AT&T, which has an "A-3" long-term credit rating from Moody's
Investors Service, priced its recent debt sale at between 2.5 and
2.9 percentage points above comparable-maturity Treasury yields. 
The 30-year Treasury note as of Friday carried a yield of around
5.22% and the 10-year bill was yielding about 4.77%.

Should Verizon go forward with the debt sale, proceeds could be
directed toward any number of pressing financing needs.  Near the
top of the list would be $7 billion due on the $8.8 billion
purchase of spectrum licenses from bankrupt NextWave Telecom.

Earlier this month, Verizon Wireless filed an updated SEC filing
for its proposed initial public offering of common stock, which
has a hypothetical value of $5 billion.  Proceeds from that
offering, expected by the middle of next year, would be directed
toward repaying debt to Verizon Communications, buying spectrum
licenses, and funding capital expenditures. 

In its quarterly report filed with the SEC last week, Verizon
Communications said it had devoted $12.4 billion to capital
spending for the first nine months of this year.  It expects to
shell out up to $4.7 billion for capital expenditures in the
fourth quarter.

Refunding of debt with shorter-term maturities also looms large. 
At Sept. 30, Verizon listed on its books $18.8 billion of debt
maturing within one year, in addition to $45 billion of long-term
debt.  The company had $1.3 billion of cash and $5.9 billion of
unused bank credit at the end of the third quarter. -- John
