Subject:	A quote from Massey

Virtually everyone wants us to move forward, define some market rules, define some new tariff rules, so that a little guy, a trader in Arkansas that wants to trade in Maine, can do so easily without having to understand rules for 17 different RTOs. I think this is a banner week for RTO policy. I think we finally have political will for bold, decisive action. We've got a head of steam up. We're going to move quickly." - FERC Commissioner William Massey on RTO week.

Rick:  now will you quit picking on poor bill?
