Rick

Thanks again for taking the time to chat last night. I just got back from Zurich and will call Jaime this evening.
I will sort of lay out my thought process and commit to a hard deadline of November 16th as you 
and I agreed. 

Unfortunately the phone connection was - at times - poor and it was tough to hear. However, I understood that you 
were prepared to cover 50% of my flight to Brazil so that I can meet with Sergio, Orlando, etc on the 12th. 
I have a quote for a discounted ticket of  ? 1485 plus tax which works out to US$ 2,153 at the current exchange rate. Does
splitting this work for you (i.e US$ 1,075) ? 

Sophie Kingsley promised to get back to me by Monday next week with news on a contract renewal, so that
- hopefully - will be another gap filled. 

Thanks again. 
Cheers, Paul
