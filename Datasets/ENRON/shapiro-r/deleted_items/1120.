The CDC has recommended new updated guidelines for facilities receiving mail from the Brentwood facility since October 11.  Individuals in private facilities receiving incoming mail from the Brentwood facility are recommended to receive a 10 day course for prophylaxis with doxycycline.  This should include all permanent employees in the Enron Washington office and possibly other visiting Enron employees to the Washington office who have had possible contact with mail coming from the Brentwood facility.  The final recommendations regarding the completion of the full 60 day prophlyaxis will be based on further information from the CDC.  These are the current recommendations as of October 27 and are subject to change pending recommendations by the CDC.
 
The CDC has recommended doxycycline for use for prophlyaxis.  Presently, there is no indication that the anthrax is resistant to any antibiotics.  Doxycycline is just as effective as Ciprofloxacin for prophylaxis.  doxycycline is a tetracycline drug and should not be used in anyone who is allergic to tetracycline.  Women who are pregnant should check with their Ob-Gyn physician prior to taking tetracycline.
 
All ENRON EMPLOYEES are encouraged to take the flu shot this year.  Since it is difficult to distinguish the symptoms of anthrax from the flu, the CDC has recommended that everyone have a flu shot.  All Enron employees from the Washington D.C. office and those who have visited the Washington D.C. office since October 11, should see their personal physician, if they develop any symptoms such as mild fever, muscle aches, malaise, shortness of breath and headaches.  These can be symptoms of the flu.  However, they also can be symptoms of inhalation anthrax.  If any such symptoms should occur, the employees should see their personal physician right away.  The employee should inform the physician where they work and what their exposure could possibly be from mail coming from the Brentwood station.
