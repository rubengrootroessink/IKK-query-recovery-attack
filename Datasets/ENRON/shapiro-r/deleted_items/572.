Hi Rick,

I would like to put together some quick guidelines for external communications for our group.   Because it's been a while since we did our media training, I think it would be useful to give people some general guidelines.  I spoke with Meredith Philipp about this yesterday, and she said she would pull something together.  Also, I would like to flesh out the issue that I raised last week about our tone/approach.  I think this is a particularly good time to think about these issues in light of the serious credibility issues currently facing the company.  I would like to get a draft document to you by the end of the week.  That way, if you think it's useful, you can mention it on the department call Friday afternoon.

Let me know your thoughts.  Thanks,

Sue

PS  How's DC?  Try not to breathe near post offices or congressional offices.
