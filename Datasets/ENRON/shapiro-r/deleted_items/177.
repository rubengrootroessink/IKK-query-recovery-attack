TOP STORY

HARD TIMES AT MICROSOFT?
Is Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) ready to fly again? Backing out a 
$1.2 billion hit in its investment portfolio, the software titan 
reported profits of $0.43 a share. That was three cents better 
than analysts were expecting as sales grew by 6% to $6.1 billion. 

>>FULL STORY: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=522447

NEWS TO GO
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Pass the sun block. Sun Microsystems (Nasdaq: SUNW) is reporting 
a nickel a share loss for its fiscal first-quarter on a steep 
decline in revenue. The top-line sank to $2.9 billion from a 
$5.1 billion showing a year ago. Sun's set came as no surprise 
since the network computing specialist had warned investors 
earlier this month. The California company expects to return to 
profitability by the June quarter. 

Holy Beanie Babies, eBay (Nasdaq: EBAY) is still hot. The online 
auctioneer trounced expectations and bid up its fourth-quarter 
prospects. Quarterly earnings came in at $0.12 a share on a 71% 
surge in sales to $194.4 million. It's also raising the ante for 
the current period. While the company was originally expecting 
December-quarter revenue to come in between $195 million and 
$205 million, it is now hiking up both ends of the range by an 
extra $5 million. The strong showing and bar raising is an 
impressive feat as the company is a month into its 100-day 
Auction for America in which it is waiving its fees for 
charitable listings.

There's no business like e-business for PeopleSoft (Nasdaq: 
PSFT) as the enterprise software maker reported earnings from 
recurring operations of $0.15 a share, three cents ahead of Wall 
Street's projection. Thanks to a growth in license revenue for 
its flagship PeopleSoft 8 -- an excellent name for a B-movie if 
there ever was one -- sales topped the half-billion dollar mark. 

No one is putting struggling cow-patched computer maker Gateway 
(NYSE: GTW) out to pasture just yet. While the company's 
third-quarter loss was in line with already lowered 
expectations, Gateway sees shipments picking back up in the 
current quarter. Excluding charges, the company lost $0.17 a 
share on revenue of $1.4 billion. The company managed to grow 
its domestic market share in the consumer and education segments 
and is expecting to report a quarterly profit to close out the 
year. 

Last doughnuts with the Fool 
Finally, it's true. Come next week you will have to enjoy your 
Krispy Kreme (NYSE: KKD) glazed doughnut and your Starbucks 
(Nasdaq: SBUX) double latte without the company of your 
Breakfast With the Fool. It was September 21, 1998, when Yi-Hsin 
Chang and Brian Bauer rolled out our first morning plateful. The 
Nasdaq Composite stood at 1663.77 back then. It's at 1652.72 
this morning. Not a lot has changed. Everything has changed. As 
we refocus our efforts towards enhancing many of our existing 
features and rolling out new ones, we want to thank you for 
being part of our community and appreciate your patience as we 
evolve in order to serve you. Hey. You still have some of that 
doughnut glaze on your chin. So, onward and forward. Like 
Wendy's (NYSE: WEN), we just don't do breakfast anymore.

POST OF THE DAY
-----------------------------------------------------------------

APPLE Q4 - THE GOOD WITH THE BAD
"Now, we have Apple rather coyly dangling the idea of a brand 
new non-Mac device to wow the audience. At the same time, 
revenue projections are extremely conservative, at $1.4B for 
Christmas. Given the continuous stream of revenue 
over-estimation coming from Apple over the last 12 months, we 
have to assume that even Apple doesn't expect its special 
surprise to help Q4's results."
