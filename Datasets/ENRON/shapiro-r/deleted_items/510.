As you are aware, over the past several weeks the VP/MD PRC Committee has been challenged with making necessary refinements to the performance management process at Enron. We had hoped to have clarification from the Committee by our scheduled meeting on 25 October, but, we have not yet received the Committee's input.
 
As a result, we would like to reschedule the second Employee Focus Group to a later date so that we can more accurately inform you as to where Enron is in the process of implementing changes and recommendations for the Year End 2001 Performance Management Process.
 
We apologize for any inconvenience.
 
Thank you,
Gina Corteselli
Director, Global Performance Management
