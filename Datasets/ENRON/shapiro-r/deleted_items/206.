Sue, et.al.,
  =20
    The Washington Office may have more detail, but based on a little readi=
ng I did this morning, I think the answers to Sue's questions are as follow=
s:

DOE has commissioned a study (NTGS 2001) as part of addressing the transmis=
sion issues raised in the National Energy Policy (NEP) released in May, "On=
e of the recommendations directed to the Secretary of Energy to examine the=
 benefits of establishing a national electrical grid, identifying major tra=
nsmission bottlenecks and remedies to remove them."  It is not clear from m=
y reading whether the study team is internal to DOE or if a contractor is i=
nvolved; I suspect a combination.  The workshops are scheduled to collect c=
omments from industry, state government, environmental groups, etc. (the ub=
iquitous stakeholders).
The NTGS 2001 is accepting both oral and written statements, with a comment=
 portal on their website with recommendations and comments received through=
 October 10, 2001.  A transcript of the proceedings of the workshops is to =
be published.  No other documents are mentioned on the website, however, I =
expect that a final report to "...recommend regulatory and market based app=
roaches that will stimulate new investment in our interstate bulk power tra=
nsmission system".
The goal of the study is for the respond to the NEP directive so the Secret=
ary of Energy is the apparent decision maker.
The NTGS will no doubt identify much the same information as that done for =
the Western Governor's Association (WGA) during the past summer.  The major=
 physical constraints in the systems are well known, so the key questions a=
re: (1) how is investment to be made going forward and (2) what will be don=
e to facilitate siting of needed transmission.  The first of these question=
s cannot be fully resolved until the future structure of the industry is kn=
own.  This in turn means the RTO debate must be resolved.  The NTGS's goals=
 are best served by RTO formation -- the larger the better-- so RTOs format=
ion should be boosted by this effort. At the same time, many states are res=
isting the Big 5 RTO vision of West, Midwest, NE, SE & Texas RTOs covering =
the whole country.  The states also care deeply about the second issue, nam=
ely should the siting become a Federal responsibility as it is in gas pipel=
ines or should regional process be developed by the states?  I think most s=
tates acknowledge (I know they do in the West) that transmission siting nee=
ds to look beyond state borders, but governors and legislatures are loathe =
to cede this authority to Washington DC.

Linda, Ray or Sarah, if you have better information please correct my suppo=
sitions.  We also ought to discuss the positions we should take on these ma=
tters in making comments at the workshops.  I am attaching the information =
I submitted for the WGA study.  They do not address exactly the same points=
 as DOE's study issues, but perhaps they can serve as a possible starting p=
oint for discussion. =20

Sounds good.  Please let me know if we can help coordinate the preparation =
of our written and/or oral statements responding to the NTGS questions.  Al=
so, I have a few questions about the meetings:
=20

Who is the NTGS?=20
Will they produce a document/recommendation based on the upcoming meetings?=
=20
Who are the decisionmakers for that document/recommendation?=20
Where do you expect that document/recommendation will fit into the overall =
discussions around RTOs?

It would seem that Enron would want to participate in these workshops for t=
he National Transmission Grid Study 2001 (if RTO policy group, Janel/Sue th=
inks it makes sense).  I think Mike Roan would go to Detroit, Mike or I wou=
ld go to Atanta and Steve W, Dave P. or Alan would go to Phoenix.

Sue:


Not sure who would be interested in these workshops from the RTO group (if =
they are not already aware of these).  Note that these workshops will inclu=
de discussion on RTOs and are taking place at the end of this month in thre=
e cities.  More info. is at <http://tis.eh.doe.gov/ntgs/workshops.html>


NGI's Power Market Today=20

National Transmission Grid Workshops Planned=20


When President Bush unveiled his National Energy Policy (NEP) in May, the p=
lethora of recommendations included a proposal to establish a national elec=
tricity grid. Now, as the plan moves forward, three workshops are scheduled=
 this month to give all stakeholders a chance to participate in the Nationa=
l Transmission Grid Study 2001 (NTGS). The workshops, set for Detroit on Se=
pt. 24, Atlanta on Sept. 26 and Phoenix on Sept. 28, are expected to lay th=
e foundation for a proposed transmission super highway.=20

As the NTGS sees it, wholesale electricity market competition has changed t=
he way the U.S. electric grids are used. Transmission systems that historic=
ally were used to move power within small utility service territories are n=
ow frequently "stressed to their limits" as large blocks of power are moved=
 on a regional basis. The new patterns of power flow, higher electricity de=
mand and a lack of investment has led to major transmission congestion acro=
ss the country.=20

"Transmission investments go far beyond acquiring rights-of-way and buildin=
g new power lines," according to the NTGS. "State-of-the-art metering and t=
elemetry, upgrading the control centers computing capabilities and installi=
ng new technology will also be necessary if consumers are to fully realize =
the efficiency gains from competitive wholesale electric markets."=20

Could the entire U.S. electricity grid be operated as one integrated whole =
or a few large integrated markets? If it was an integrated whole or a few l=
arge markets, how could officials assure the reliability of a national grid=
? Those are just a couple of the questions participants will attempt to ans=
wer during the workshop sessions.=20

"Removing major transmission bottlenecks will help unleash the economic ben=
efits that are achieved through efficient and competitive electricity marke=
ts," according to the NTGS. But how to remove the bottlenecks still remains=
 the biggest dilemma of all. Investment barriers, seen as keys to the puzzl=
e, include a lack of regional integrated planning, difficulty in siting, an=
d uncertainty regarding investment risks and returns.=20

Basically, the NTGS has identified several issues that will be covered in t=
he all-day workshops including: transmission planning and new capacity need=
s; transmission siting and permitting; business models for transmission inv=
estment and operation; operation of interconnected transmission systems; re=
liability management and oversight; and new transmission technologies.=20

Within the transmission planning issue, participants will discuss appropria=
te measures and consideration of reliability and commerce along with siting=
 and environmental effects. Other planning issues include integration of pl=
anning for transmission, generation and demand-side management programs and=
 the role of new technologies to reduce the need for large facilities. Plan=
ning how new transmission facilities affect the ability of some generators =
to artificially raise market prices for energy also will be discussed.=20

Siting and permitting issues will include input on options to establish reg=
ional or federal siting institutions with the authority to obtain rights-of=
-way for new projects as well as the options to improve existing state-base=
d regimes. Business model issues will include the political feasibility of =
choices for Regional Transmission Organizations as well as their effects on=
 market efficiency, system reliability, operational efficiency, transmissio=
n access and interconnection policies, investment and innovation and regula=
tory oversight.=20

Workshop participants also will discuss who should make the decisions about=
 reliability and the technical and economic bases for making decisions, alo=
ng with who should take the risks. "The restructured industry will require =
a more open and inclusive process for establishing mandatory standards and =
monitoring and enforcing compliance," according to the NTGS.=20

One way to solve many of the problems will be through new transmission tech=
nologies. A major part of the workshops will be to learn the capability and=
 cost of new technologies that could improve the operation of the transmiss=
ion system, along with options available to support the development and dep=
loyment of new technologies in the current restructuring period.=20

The Detroit workshop, set for Sept. 24, will be held at the Detroit Marriot=
t Romulus at Metro Airport, 30559 Flynn Dr., Romulus. The Atlanta workshop,=
 set for Sept. 26, will be held at the Hyatt Regency, 265 Peachtree St. NE.=
 The Phoenix workshop will be Sept. 28 at the Phoenix Airport Marriott. All=
 three workshops will begin at 9 a.m. and adjourn by 4 p.m.=20

For those unable to participate in a workshop session, the NTGS also will o=
ffer an opportunity for non-registrants to make recommendations, with a tra=
nscript of the proceedings for each workshop available. Recommendations and=
 comments also will be accepted through Oct. 10 by the NTGS.=20

d at (202) 586-2577 or by e-mail at zead.haddad@hd.doe.gov. For technical q=
uestions about the study, contact Paul Carrier at (202) 586-5659 or send an=
