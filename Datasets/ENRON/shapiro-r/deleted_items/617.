Rick,
I thought you might be interested to know that the NY PSC approved the joint settlement proposal in Central Hudson's Rate Case.  I'm working with Amr and relevant people within EES to quantify the overall benefits.  I will send you a memo once we have determined the positive impacts on the IBM deal.  In the meantime, if you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.  
Thanks,
Kathleen
