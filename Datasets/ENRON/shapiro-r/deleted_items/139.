Caminus and Altra Energy Partner to Create
Full-Service Trading Software Provider=20



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis=20


  <http://secure.scientech.com/rci/wsimages/will100border_copy.jpg>

[News item from Reuters] Software company Caminus Corp. (Nasdaq: CAMZ) anno=
unced it would buy the software operations of privately held Altra Energy C=
orp. Caminus said it would swap 1.975 shares of its stock and pay $30 milli=
on cash for Altra's software business. That values the deal at about $62 mi=
llion, based on Caminus' closing price of $16.05 on Oct. 12.=20

Analysis: The announcement that Caminus and Altra Energy are joining forces=
 represents major news for the energy industry, particularly impacting thos=
e companies that are involved in the trading sector. On their own, both com=
panies have ascended in the trading space by focusing on a particular niche=
. Now that Caminus is acquiring Altra's software suite, which is primarily =
focused on the natural-gas trading sector, the synergy between the two comp=
anies creates a fuller package of offerings for companies that are involved=
 in energy trading. Essentially, Altra has two core businesses-an energy tr=
ading exchange and a software business. Caminus has entered into an agreeme=
nt process to purchase only the software side of Altra. Altra has a highly =
regarded portfolio of software systems and consultant services primarily fo=
cused on the automation of gas transaction management and pipeline operatio=
ns. Together, the synergy of the two companies is intended to enable greate=
r participation for traders in existing online energy trading exchanges.=20

Let's first establish the business models of these two companies so that we=
 can fully appreciate the synergies that the new partnership will create. U=
p to the point of this partnership, Caminus and Altra were not considered d=
irect-line competitors, as Caminus' business model focused on risk manageme=
nt while Altra focused on the actual energy transactions. However, there we=
re components of the companies' businesses that certainly overlapped. Camin=
us Corp. has created a software suite that helps utilities and gas producer=
s trade energy commodities in exchanges such as EnronOnline, TradeSpark, Ho=
ustonStreet, etc. Altra's software, which is used in the same energy tradin=
g portals, focuses on natural-gas transactions.=20

Headquartered in New York, Caminus, which went public a year ago, is a prov=
ider of software solutions (and consulting services) that help a wide range=
 of participants in the energy market to manage their risk factors associat=
ed with energy trading. Toward that end, the company offers two software pa=
ckages:


Zai*Net software solutions, which "enables energy organizations to effectiv=
ely trade and manage energy transactions." Zai*Net has been designed to add=
ress a wide range of energy commodities, traded instruments and associated =
risks and was designed to interface with both proprietary and third-party s=
ystems.


Nucleus software systems, which were designed specifically to meet the trad=
ing, risk management, scheduling, and accounting needs of utilities, genera=
ting companies, power pools, gas and oil producers, processors, pipelines, =
and other energy market participants. In other words, the Caminus Nucleus s=
ystem provides a tool for energy traders to organize, track and manage thei=
r various energy transactions from generation to end-user delivery. One of =
the advantages to the Nucleus software is that users can evaluate assets an=
d market positions in real-time and consequently determine acceptable risk =
levels.=20

Recently, Caminus added the Storefront product, which is a Web-based tradin=
g application that helps customers to increase trading volume and reduce tr=
ansaction costs by publishing bids and offers on the Internet. Also, just t=
his week at the Power Mart conference in Houston, Caminus unveiled a new so=
ftware product known as FrontOffice?, which gives traders of energy physica=
ls and traded instruments the ability to see how a potential deal will affe=
ct a portfolio before committing to the transaction. According to company r=
eports, approximately 80 percent of Caminus' revenue comes from software li=
cense sales. In addition, Caminus also has a consulting service that focuse=
s on risk management services for energy clients.=20

One reason that Caminus has gotten a good share of industry attention latel=
y is its efforts, along with other software companies, to establish a commo=
n standard for moving transaction data from energy trading platforms to tra=
nsaction / risk management systems. A few months ago, Caminus established t=
he Energy Trading Standards Group with HoustonStreet, and has since generat=
ed interest in some 30 companies to participate and help create universal s=
tandards for energy trading. One of the key objectives of the Standards Gro=
up is to help determine which technology should be used as the standard pro=
tocol for energy trading platforms. The technology committee is reportedly =
working on a beta version of XML standard for physical power transactions.=
=20

In September, Caminus formed a strategic partnership with Lodestar Corp., w=
hich primarily provides billing software and load forecasting solutions. Un=
der the partnership, Caminus and Lodestar will work to integrate and jointl=
y market their respective wholesale and retail energy billing, transaction,=
 trading, and risk management systems to create what they are calling a "St=
raight-Through Processing (STP)" environment for vertically integrated ener=
gy companies.=20

By comparison, Altra Energy is a private company located in Houston that pr=
ovides software systems primarily focused on managing the transactions and =
physical movement of the gas and pipeline segment of the industry. Altra re=
portedly has the largest base of systems in the gas segment of the market. =
Some of the specific features of the Altra software include scheduling of d=
irect access load, generation dispatch, regional transmission organization =
(RTO) connectivity, integrated OASIS reservations, and North American Elect=
ric Reliability Council (NERC) checkout and billing. Altra boasts a custome=
r list of about 100 clients, mostly in the gas sector but also including po=
wer and multi-fuel companies. Altra's software product suite includes trans=
action management tools known as Altra Gas, Altra Power, Altra Pipeline and=
 Altra Web, which all facilitate the exchange of a particular commodity.=20

According to Caminus, the value of acquiring Altra's software suite is to c=
reate an offering of integrated applications that can be applied to both ga=
s and power traders. Further, the exchange of customers should benefit both=
 companies. Caminus will have the opportunity to sell its risk management s=
ervices to Altra's customer base, and in turn gain the opportunity to sell =
Altra's new generation of systems to Caminus customers.=20

The European market is arguably the top focus of Caminus Corp. In fact, Cam=
inus believes that the global market for energy trading is presently "explo=
ding." According to Caminus CEO David Stoner, the global market for wholesa=
le energy trading, which consists of the European market, is six to eight t=
imes the size of retail markets. Consequently, a typical therm gets traded =
a number of times in Europe before it actually gets sold to an end user. In=
terestingly, about 30 to 40 percent of the companies to which Caminus has p=
rovided risk management consulting services are U.S. companies attempting t=
o expand in the European wholesale trading market. Caminus consultants help=
ed write the New Electricity Trading Arrangements (NETA) for the British go=
vernment, due to be implemented by the end of 2001 or early 2002. Although =
smaller than the U.S. market, Britain has been experiencing privatization a=
nd various levels of deregulation since 1983, providing valuable experience=
 and depth. Besides the U.K., Caminus has been active throughout Europe in =
Italy, Spain, Holland, Belgium, Germany, and the Nordic countries through N=
ORDPOOL.=20

Earnings for Caminus have been fairly strong up until recently, when fallou=
t from the events of Sept. 11 began to impact the company's business. For 2=
Q 2001, Caminus reported that its total revenues increased 58 percent to $1=
7.7 million, compared to $11.2 million for 2Q 2000. Specifically, revenues =
from the company's software license fees increased 61 percent to $7.5 milli=
on during the same quarter. However, for 3Q 2001, Caminus lost $369,000, or=
 2 cents a share, on revenue of $14.7 million, due primarily to the fact so=
me license sales that were expected to close did not. Specifically, Caminus=
 says that much of the revenue from its license sales is booked during the =
last month of each quarter. Given the impact that the events of Sept. 11 ha=
d on many companies, a large part of this anticipated revenue was not booke=
d as scheduled.=20

Moving forward, Caminus says that the addition of Altra's software should r=
esult in an increase of its 2002 revenue guidance by about 40 percent. Cami=
nus also expects the partnership with Altra to increase its 4Q earnings to =
27 cents a share, compared with a previous estimate of 23 cents a share, al=
though analysts are still projecting 19 cents a share for the fourth quarte=
r.=20

Deregulation has opened up many new opportunities for generation companies =
to trade and market power in new regions. However, with these opportunities=
 come considerable risks. Hence, creating this balance between risk and opp=
ortunity in the energy trading space is the market niche in which Caminus a=
nd Altra operate. However, the software market in the energy trading space =
is becoming increasingly competitive. Every month, new competitors in this =
space emerge, so it is difficult to offer a comprehensive list. However, so=
me competitors that also seek market share in the niche now occupied by Cam=
inus / Altra are Allegro Development, KWI and SolArc (to name just a few).=
=20

Moreover, competition in wholesale trading should continue to gain momentum=
, regardless of the status of deregulation in a particular state. The whole=
sale market is without question far more attractive to traders than the ret=
ail market, and as I mentioned power is often traded many times on the whol=
esale market before it reaches the end user. Thus, consolidation within the=
 energy-trading software space should continue, and I would expect Caminus =
to proceed with further acquisitions once it integrates the Altra software =
into its service offerings.=20

Clarification Statement to 10/16/01 IssueAlert on Dynegy: In its 3Q 2001 ea=
rnings statement, Dynegy reported that net income of its transmission and d=
istribution company Illinois Power was $26 million, versus $27 million in 3=
Q 2000. In the 10/16 column, we incorrectly stated that Illinois Power had =
taken a loss of $15 million. The loss of $15 million was reported by Dynegy=
's telecommunications segment, which was duly noted in the article. We apol=
ogize for any confusion this error might have caused.=20
