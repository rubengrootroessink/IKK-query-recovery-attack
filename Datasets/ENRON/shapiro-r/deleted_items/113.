FYI, I think Robert has some very useful skills, particularly on the gas side.  I think Jim's suggestion of moving him to Leslie's group is a good one.  He could also continue to help with the LNG group's "nuts and bolts" issues (I don't recommend using him on their policy issues).  

He may be a volunteer.
