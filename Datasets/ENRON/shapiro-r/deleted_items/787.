Rick, the Rainbow Coalition is holding an energy congress at the Hyatt on November 11-13.  We are on a panel on "Strategic Partnership for Inclusion" on November 13, and they have also asked us to participate in the Congressional Black Caucus Roundtable on Monday November 12.

I am sending you info on who will be there (several members of Congress including everyone's favorite, Sheila Jackson Lee), and wonder if you would like to send anyone.  Please let me know.  Thanks.
