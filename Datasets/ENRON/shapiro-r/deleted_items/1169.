Rick,

Please find attached the Budget 2002 pack we will be discussing with Michael Brown tomorrow at 6pm.
NB: There is some confidential salary information attached.

(Just press print - there are some hidden sheets)

Any questions please let myself or Paul know (Paul has asked me to forward a copy to you).
 


Thanks
Greg
