ber 21, 2001     Enron Continues to Implode;  Will the Dynegy Deal Proceed?=
  By Will McNamara Director, Electric Industry Analysis    [News item from =
Reuters] Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE) shares fell sharply in opening trade on No=
v. 20 after the humbled energy giant warned it could be forced to pay by ne=
xt week $690 million in debt triggered by a credit downgrade last week. The=
 shares were down $1.16, or 12.8 percent, to just over $7.00 in early morni=
ng trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock was the biggest loser by=
 percentage change and the second-most active stock on the NYSE. As of earl=
y morning trading on Nov. 21, Enron shares were priced at $4.85, reportedly=
 their lowest level in nearly 10 years.   Analysis: To paraphrase Shakespea=
re, "Oh, what a tangled web they weave when first they attempt to?" Wait, I=
 better stop. When speaking about Enron, I am not prepared to finish that s=
entence, at least at this point. Enron has been accused of a lot of things =
over the last few weeks, but at this juncture an ongoing Securities and Exc=
hange Commission (SEC) investigation has yet to reach any conclusion regard=
ing deceptive financial reporting on the part of the Houston trader. Enron =
itself has admitted that its financial records from 1997 through the first =
half of 2001 "should not be relied upon." Nevertheless, perception is reali=
ty and the perception currently in the industry is that Enron is now taking=
 a fall after getting caught following years of skirting the truth. While n=
egative perception continues to cause damage to Enron's stock, perhaps of m=
ore current interest are the developments that are more grounded in reality=
. We know Enron has just lowered its third-quarter earnings, faces a stiff =
payment of $690 million (due within a week, in fact) and has cast doubt ove=
r its 4Q earnings potential. The question of the hour is whether these new =
financial hits will represent a "material adverse change" in the eyes of Dy=
negy, which still aims to buy Enron but wisely included an exit clause in i=
ts purchase contract. The other question is, what happens to Enron if Dyneg=
y leaves it standing at the altar? A terminated marriage agreement would su=
rely cause further reductions to Enron's already-weak credit standing, and =
it is unknown how the company could recover from another blow to its reputa=
tion.   As has been the case since the first of October, the ongoing "fall =
of Enron" story is changing by the day. For background on Dynegy's proposed=
 acquisition of Enron, and Enron's financial problems that precipitated the=
 proposal, please see my 11/12/01 IssueAlert (available at  www.scientech.c=
om/rci << File: http://secure.scientech.com/issuealert/article.asp?id=3D987=
 >> ). In the interest of time, let me summarize what is happening at this =
moment. Dynegy rode in as Enron's white knight and plopped down a $9-billio=
n offer ($10 a share) to buy the company, which at the time represented a s=
teal of a price considering that Enron was priced at almost $90 a share lit=
tle more than a year ago. To some extent, this seemed like the final chapte=
r in the Enron saga. In other words, the company had gone through a tumultu=
ous year, hit its "rock bottom" but still planned to live happily ever afte=
r as part of Dynegy, Inc., its much-smaller rival.    The developments just=
 this week amount to a screeching brake that may in fact interrupt the nupt=
ials between the two companies. For starters, on Monday (Nov. 19), Enron su=
bmitted its 10-Q report to the SEC (which was five days late, by the way). =
In the report, Enron dropped what have turned out to be several bombshells.=
 First, Enron disclosed that, due to recent downgrades of its credit rating=
 by agencies such as Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch, it has to pay of=
f or refinance by Nov. 26 debt it owes to a third party with which it has a=
 partnership, or face nearly $4 billion in additional payments. Enron also =
has the option of finding new collateral to guarantee the debt. Enron would=
 not disclose who owns the note, but we know that the limited partnership i=
ncludes holdings in C.E.G. Rio, a Brazilian natural gas-company that Enron =
had planned to sell to raise about $250 million in cash. Note that just las=
t week, various credit services lowered Enron's senior unsecured debt to on=
e notch above junk status and warned that further downgrades may occur, whi=
ch apparently prompted the call for the debt payment. Reportedly, if Enron =
does not make the $690-million payment by Nov. 27, investors will gain the =
right to immediately begin liquidating the asset for an amount equal to the=
 note payable. Enron is presently scrambling to establish a "mutually accep=
table" amendment with lenders to avoid having to issue payment on the debt.=
 Along with the acknowledgement of the imminent payment of $690 million, En=
ron said that any further drop in its credit rating might necessitate furth=
er payments of $3.9 billion to other partnerships, the bulk of that figure =
going to Osprey Trust and Marlin Water Trust.    Also in the new SEC filing=
, Enron increased its 3Q 2001 loss by 3 cents a share to 87 cents. Enron or=
iginally reported a 3Q loss of $618 million, but has now raised that figure=
 to $664 million. As a minor bright side, Enron did increase reported earni=
ngs for the first nine months of 2001 by a penny to 20 cents a share, attri=
buted to adjustments made after the quarter's end. However, looking forward=
, Enron warned that continuing credit worries and a decline in the value of=
 some of its assets could take a further toll on fourth-quarter earnings. E=
nron also claims that, even still, the numbers contained in the 10-Q report=
 are not necessarily final as they have not been reviewed by Arthur Anderse=
n, the company's external auditor. Thus, further revision of the numbers co=
uld take place.    Interestingly, there does not seem to be a big question =
about whether or not Enron can pay the $690-million debt obligation. Enron =
apparently has secured an additional $2 billion in loans from J.P. Morgan C=
hase and Citigroup in the last week. In fact, within the current SEC filing=
, Enron says that is has $1.2 billion of domestic cash consisting of the li=
nes of credit and net collections. Thus, some investors are reassured by th=
e belief that Enron has the cash on hand to make the $690-million payment i=
f it is unable to renegotiate terms with lenders. According to the SEC fili=
ng, Enron also intends to sell off $8 billion in non-core businesses that a=
re performing "below acceptable rates" and would use the proceeds to pay of=
f debts, although this money would probably not be immediately available.  =
 Again, however, there is a perception element to this development that sho=
uld be noted. Enron has been accused of financing partnerships in the past =
in such a way as to keep them off the company's balance sheets. Apparently,=
 this non-disclosure was done so that Enron could grow quickly without addi=
ng too much debt to its own books or diluting the value of its stock. As ha=
s been well documented, Enron is already in the midst of an intense SEC inv=
estigation regarding potential conflict-of-issues involving its former CFO.=
 News about other financial deals that may not have been fully disclosed is=
 clearly making investors even more nervous about Enron's stock.     As I s=
aid, the question of the hour is whether or not Enron's new problems will c=
ause Dynegy to reconsider its offer. As usual, the answer all depends on wh=
o you ask. Dynegy is remaining mum and referring all questions about Enron'=
s financial status to Enron. Investors are rather mixed on the question. So=
me say that the facts disclosed in the 10-Q report do not dramatically chan=
ge Enron's position from what it was when Dynegy launched its acquisition a=
nd that the current drop in Enron's stock is just a knee-jerk response to t=
he media hype surrounding the story. Further, those who diminish any potent=
ial impact say that Enron is still a liquid company and has money coming in=
 from various sources. Thus, it should have no trouble making the $690-mill=
ion payment. From a broad perspective, so one theory goes, Dynegy is still =
getting a great deal in Enron due to its staggering drop in stock price, an=
d the acquisition remains valuable to Dynegy as it will position the combin=
ed company as North America's biggest marketer and trader of natural gas an=
d electricity.   In contrast, other investors point to the fact that since =
the purchase agreement was signed, Enron's stock has fallen an additional 3=
2.5 percent, which weakens the original acquisition agreement. In addition,=
 if Enron follows through with the $690-million payment next week or secure=
s additional financing to front this cost, both options alter the company's=
 financial position from when Dynegy made its original offer, which could b=
e construed as a "material adverse change."   Another interesting developme=
nt indicates that Enron may no longer be the company that Dynegy agreed to =
purchase. New reports indicate many energy trading companies are now unwill=
ing to sell power or natural gas to Enron for fear about the company's cred=
it concerns. Such companies are now particularly reticent to sell power to =
Enron for next-day delivery. What this means in practical terms is that oth=
er trading companies may be gaining Enron's market share, which could dimin=
ish the value in the trading market that had attracted Dynegy to Enron in t=
he first place. In addition, Enron's once-stellar energy trading business c=
ould now become reduced or collapse altogether.   Questions have been raise=
d why Dynegy is not doing more at this time to help Enron out of its financ=
ial mess. Of course, under the acquisition agreement Dynegy already committ=
ed to providing an immediate $1.5-billion asset-backed equity infusion into=
 Enron to help the company with its current financial woes, which will be f=
ollowed by an additional infusion of $2.5 billion into the combined company=
 by ChevronTexaco, which owns 27 percent of Dynegy. However, some traders a=
pparently have wondered why Dynegy has not done anything about Enron's dimi=
nishing ability to secure power on the open market. Traders claim that Dyne=
gy could step in and buy power from sellers on the behalf of Enron, in a st=
rategy known as "sleeving." The fact that Dynegy has not chosen to take thi=
s step has been an indication to some observers that it is only willing to =
go so far in its pursuit of Enron.   In addition, Enron shareholders launch=
ed a lawsuit on Nov. 12 in state court in Houston to prevent the merger wit=
h Dynegy from happening. The petition reportedly alleges that Enron directo=
rs breached their fiduciary duties by agreeing to sell the company at too l=
ow a price and without adequate consideration of other alternatives. Enron =
said it will defend its decision in court.    Moreover, Dynegy was smart to=
 include an exit clause in the acquisition agreement. The clause reportedly=
 allows Dynegy to walk away from Enron if any material adverse change occur=
s related to the outcome of the SEC investigation, possible litigation agai=
nst Enron, balance sheet strengths, and earnings forecasts. Certainly the l=
atest developments disclosed in Enron's 10-Q filing with the SEC impact the=
 company's balance sheet strengths and earnings forecasts, so a case could =
be made that Dynegy would have grounds to terminate the acquisition. Clearl=
y, this pending deal hinges on the developments that will take place over t=
he next few weeks. Dynegy ultimately will have to weigh the pros and cons o=
f its acquisition offer for Enron and determine if the once-golden company =
still represents a great deal, or if pursuing the purchase would cause more=
 trouble than it is worth.    An archive list of previous IssueAlert articl=
