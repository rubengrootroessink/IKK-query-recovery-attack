I will be more than willing to help.

I will prepare a draft presentation for the 11:15- 12:15 slot. What I need =
from you is the following:

a) List of journalists to attend (names and organizations)
b) The complete schedule for the day. Who will be presenting what, in which=
 sequence. This will help me fine tune the presentation
c) Two or three key messages you would like me to convey.=20
d) Languages (e.g. presentation in Portuguese, slides in English, or both i=
n English, etc.)


Regarding item "c" , one of my favorite messages, on a high road approach, =
is what I call the " virtuous circle of contracting". In very simple words,=
 I try to convey the message that regulatory reform has several elements, i=
nvolving legal, technical, commercial and regulatory per se. Some of them m=
ore visible than others. In the reform of the energy sector in Brazil some =
of them have been taking care while others need further elaboration. Howeve=
r, there is an important, oftentimes  negleted cornerstone, which is contra=
ct sancity. In the Anglo-Saxon culture, this sounds very obvious. However, =
it is not so obvious when we start developing businesses overseas. Just to =
illustrate this point, I am attaching a presentation recently delivered in =
Brazil, which was very well received by Minister Parente, the energy czar. =
It basically states that if Brazil wants to be serious about privatization,=
 electric reform and sector expansion, we have to respect contracts. The go=
vernment should walk this talk. Most of the issues we are currently facing =
in Brazil right now (Annex V, Wholesale Agreement, MAE price, Itaipu Excess=
 Energy, Spot price calculation, " Parcela A" pass-through, and many others=
) fit perfectly within this overall umbrella message.=20

A subsequent presentation, more focused on Brazil versus California Crisis =
is also attached. Several Journalists in Brazil tend to jum to conclusions =
by saying that because of the failure of the California experiment, we shou=
ld stop ongoing reforms.=20

We may prepare a completely different one, but I think it is worth emphazin=
g the concept of contract sanctity and how it has been systematically viola=
ted.

 =20
Please let me know what the next steps should be

Luiz,
International Public Relations is sponsoring a visit from a group of Brazil=
ian Journalists from leading Brazilian Business Journals on Friday, October=
 4.  We would like someone from Government Affairs to speak to them concern=
ing regulatory reform.  Keith Miceli suggested we contact you.

Enron Brazil is working hard to bring about regulatory reform in Brazil so =
its trading and origination businesses can profitably operate.  The Brazili=
an media is an important opinion maker in the public policy debates on issu=
es of interest to Enron.  The purpose of sponsoring the visit of these Braz=
ilian journalists is to increase rapport with key media representatives, bu=
ild greater their understanding of the energy sector and foster news storie=
s that are supportive and objective.

We have a time slot available from 11:15 am until 12:15 am.  This time slot=
 is flexible.  Please let me know if you or someone from your group will be=
 available for this.

Thank you.
Jennifer
