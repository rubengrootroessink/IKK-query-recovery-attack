Rob--are you working on a speech/panel discussion that Ken Lay is supposed to be involved in November 7-8 in New York CIty sponsored by FOrtune Magazine and hosted by Mayor Guiliani?  If Mr. Lay is still intending to participate, I need a bit more information to be able to leverage the work that we have been doing in New York.
