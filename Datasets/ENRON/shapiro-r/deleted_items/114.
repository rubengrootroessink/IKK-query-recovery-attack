It appears that U.S. and Canadian officials responsible for softwood lumber=
 negotiations have agreed to "a framework for a deal, not a final deal."  I=
n our last update, we relayed an unconfirmed source report that a political=
 deal had been worked out on softwood lumber between the US and Canada.  Ef=
forts to confirm this information were conducted, and our results refute th=
e existence of a firm deal.  There is, however, a new political climate in =
wake of September 11th, and both Ottawa and Washington would like to resolv=
e the lumber dispute rather than have it continue on their radar screen now=
 that they have other more urgent priorities.  Deputy USTR Mary Ryckman has=
 been quoted as saying "We are looking to an alternative to litigation."  T=
o that end, Washington has appointed former Montana governor Marc Racicot a=
s 'envoy' for the US in negotiations.  Thus, it appears that both countries=
 have agreed in principle that a deal is preferable to litigation, though n=
o specific deal has been made and the litigation process will continue for =
now from both sides (the US petitions and the Canadian WTO actions).  We wi=
ll continue to make appropriate inquiries on the negotiation process and re=
port information as it is received. Meanwhile, the following reminders and =
updates:
Bilateral talks are in progress this week in Vancouver, BC, though initial =
reports indicate that things are going slowly.  Discussions center on BC's =
proposal for a new forest management policy (the details of which remain va=
gue).=20
The DOC's preliminary determination on AD has been postponed to October 30t=
h; there will be no further delays.=20
Bush's desire for a Free Trade Agreement in the Americas would be a trade a=
genda priority for which Canadian support would be important when the prese=
nt crisis eases, providing further incentive for the US to negotiate.
