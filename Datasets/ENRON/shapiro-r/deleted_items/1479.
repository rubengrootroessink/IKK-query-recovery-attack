Rick,

FYI.  I was asked to put this together for Jim Fallon by Scott Manuel, Frank McGuiness and Rus Woody.  I am providing the same analysis to Kay Mann, et. al., for purposes of PROJECT THUNDERDOME.  This is a strategic reassessment of where new EBS businesses should reside relative to existing (i.e. content and network).  I am happy to give you a briefing on this if you desire.  I have schedule time to discuss with you next week.  Thanks.

Mona
