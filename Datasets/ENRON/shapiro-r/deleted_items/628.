Barbara: Contrary to what I might have said yesterday, I would not limit my search to the Energy industry. My skills are entirely transferable and I'm a quick study. I appreciate your help. Enron was a godsend for me and allowed me to fulfill my potential...I am very confident I can do what I"ve done at Enron again.
