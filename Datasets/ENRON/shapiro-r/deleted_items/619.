Just wanted to let you know that Linda gave an outstanding talk today at the Alliance to Save Energy Associates' summit.  The talk was on "Forging New Markets for Energy Efficiency".  She quickly grasped and relayed (in plain English -- not a small feat!) the description of Tradable Efficiency Certificates (negawatts) derived from energy efficiency.  She BY FAR had the most people gathered around wanting to learn more!   Thought you'd like to have some GOOD news!
 
Cheers,
