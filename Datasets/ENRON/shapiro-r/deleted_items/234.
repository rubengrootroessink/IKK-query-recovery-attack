Hi Rick

A few things:

1. Attached is a more detailed exercise I went through at Paul's request to provide him
with more of the information he needs in the negotiations with Michael. Some of the material
will be familiar to you. Let me know if you have any questions or comments. 

2. Had my PRC with Shaw. It went well. Amber has faxed in through to you.

3. Mexico: Spent a good hour on the phone with Jaime Williams. Very helpful in better understanding the 
opportunity. He will be in touch with you to outline the basics of a package. I am in "deep deliberation" mode  and will get back to you and Jaime before the end of the week. 

4. Brazil: Have been trying to reach Orlando but with no success. Could you please prompt him on this.
I assume that the deadline on decision about Brazil is not quite so binding?

Thanks, Paul
