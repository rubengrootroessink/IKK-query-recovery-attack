RE: DRAFT Leave-Behinds for RTO Week
      -Conference Call FRIDAY, October 12th, 11:00 a.m. EDT

Based on discussions last week, several members suggested that EPSA create "big picture" leave-behinds for RTO Week at FERC.  EPSA has drafted bullet points for the leave-behinds, designed to follow the workshop agenda for the week.  

We will be holding a conference call on Friday, October 12th, at 11:00 a.m. EDT to prepare for RTO week and discuss the draft leave-behinds.  To access the call, dial 1-800-937-6563 and ask for the Julie Simon/EPSA call.   If you have any questions, comments or suggestions, please contact Julie Simon at 202-628-8200 or jsimon@epsa.org.
