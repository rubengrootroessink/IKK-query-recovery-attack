Rick:

I hope that I am not exceeding my authority from Risk Analytics perspective by seeking your permission to comment on the suggested new structure of the Department.  If you think that this is not necessary at this stage, I would like to communicate the following points:

The concern of risk analytics is to ensure the following:
1.	The different business activities, and the different regions are well identified and covered, yet not isolated from each other to negatively impact synergy.  
2.	The suggested structure clearly identifies lines of responsibility, and accountability.
3.	The above lines of responsibility, and accountability, pass through your primary support direct system (i.e., Jim Steffes); this is at least as far as the "regulatory-intensive" functions.    
4.	Ensure that support functions (e.g. database management, regulatory research) are well connected to the different components of the Department.

I am confident that you had addressed these issues, however, and  to stop beating around the bush, I  just want to discuss further point 3 above for its relative importance in the coming period.  

I look forward for any question or comment
