;  Will the Dynegy Deal Proceed?  By Will McNamara Director, Electric Indus=
try Analysis    [News item from Reuters] Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE) shares fel=
l sharply in opening trade on Nov. 20 after the humbled energy giant warned=
 it could be forced to pay by next week $690 million in debt triggered by a=
 credit downgrade last week. The shares were down $1.16, or 12.8 percent, t=
o just over $7.00 in early morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Th=
e stock was the biggest loser by percentage change and the second-most acti=
ve stock on the NYSE. As of early morning trading on Nov. 21, Enron shares =
were priced at $4.85, reportedly their lowest level in nearly 10 years.   A=
nalysis: To paraphrase Shakespeare, "Oh, what a tangled web they weave when=
 first they attempt to?" Wait, I better stop. When speaking about Enron, I =
am not prepared to finish that sentence, at least at this point. Enron has =
been accused of a lot of things over the last few weeks, but at this junctu=
re an ongoing Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation has ye=
t to reach any conclusion regarding deceptive financial reporting on the pa=
rt of the Houston trader. Enron itself has admitted that its financial reco=
rds from 1997 through the first half of 2001 "should not be relied upon." N=
evertheless, perception is reality and the perception currently in the indu=
stry is that Enron is now taking a fall after getting caught following year=
s of skirting the truth. While negative perception continues to cause damag=
e to Enron's stock, perhaps of more current interest are the developments t=
hat are more grounded in reality. We know Enron has just lowered its third-=
quarter earnings, faces a stiff payment of $690 million (due within a week,=
 in fact) and has cast doubt over its 4Q earnings potential. The question o=
f the hour is whether these new financial hits will represent a "material a=
dverse change" in the eyes of Dynegy, which still aims to buy Enron but wis=
ely included an exit clause in its purchase contract. The other question is=
, what happens to Enron if Dynegy leaves it standing at the altar? A termin=
ated marriage agreement would surely cause further reductions to Enron's al=
ready-weak credit standing, and it is unknown how the company could recover=
 from another blow to its reputation.   As has been the case since the firs=
t of October, the ongoing "fall of Enron" story is changing by the day. For=
 background on Dynegy's proposed acquisition of Enron, and Enron's financia=
l problems that precipitated the proposal, please see my 11/12/01 IssueAler=
t (available at  www.scientech.com/rci ). In the interest of time, let me s=
ummarize what is happening at this moment. Dynegy rode in as Enron's white =
knight and plopped down a $9-billion offer ($10 a share) to buy the company=
, which at the time represented a steal of a price considering that Enron w=
as priced at almost $90 a share little more than a year ago. To some extent=
, this seemed like the final chapter in the Enron saga. In other words, the=
 company had gone through a tumultuous year, hit its "rock bottom" but stil=
l planned to live happily ever after as part of Dynegy, Inc., its much-smal=
ler rival.    The developments just this week amount to a screeching brake =
that may in fact interrupt the nuptials between the two companies. For star=
ters, on Monday (Nov. 19), Enron submitted its 10-Q report to the SEC (whic=
h was five days late, by the way). In the report, Enron dropped what have t=
urned out to be several bombshells. First, Enron disclosed that, due to rec=
ent downgrades of its credit rating by agencies such as Moody's, Standard &=
 Poor's and Fitch, it has to pay off or refinance by Nov. 26 debt it owes t=
o a third party with which it has a partnership, or face nearly $4 billion =
in additional payments. Enron also has the option of finding new collateral=
 to guarantee the debt. Enron would not disclose who owns the note, but we =
know that the limited partnership includes holdings in C.E.G. Rio, a Brazil=
ian natural gas-company that Enron had planned to sell to raise about $250 =
million in cash. Note that just last week, various credit services lowered =
Enron's senior unsecured debt to one notch above junk status and warned tha=
t further downgrades may occur, which apparently prompted the call for the =
debt payment. Reportedly, if Enron does not make the $690-million payment b=
y Nov. 27, investors will gain the right to immediately begin liquidating t=
he asset for an amount equal to the note payable. Enron is presently scramb=
ling to establish a "mutually acceptable" amendment with lenders to avoid h=
aving to issue payment on the debt. Along with the acknowledgement of the i=
mminent payment of $690 million, Enron said that any further drop in its cr=
edit rating might necessitate further payments of $3.9 billion to other par=
tnerships, the bulk of that figure going to Osprey Trust and Marlin Water T=
rust.    Also in the new SEC filing, Enron increased its 3Q 2001 loss by 3 =
cents a share to 87 cents. Enron originally reported a 3Q loss of $618 mill=
ion, but has now raised that figure to $664 million. As a minor bright side=
, Enron did increase reported earnings for the first nine months of 2001 by=
 a penny to 20 cents a share, attributed to adjustments made after the quar=
ter's end. However, looking forward, Enron warned that continuing credit wo=
rries and a decline in the value of some of its assets could take a further=
 toll on fourth-quarter earnings. Enron also claims that, even still, the n=
umbers contained in the 10-Q report are not necessarily final as they have =
not been reviewed by Arthur Andersen, the company's external auditor. Thus,=
 further revision of the numbers could take place.    Interestingly, there =
does not seem to be a big question about whether or not Enron can pay the $=
690-million debt obligation. Enron apparently has secured an additional $2 =
billion in loans from J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup in the last week. In =
fact, within the current SEC filing, Enron says that is has $1.2 billion of=
 domestic cash consisting of the lines of credit and net collections. Thus,=
 some investors are reassured by the belief that Enron has the cash on hand=
 to make the $690-million payment if it is unable to renegotiate terms with=
 lenders. According to the SEC filing, Enron also intends to sell off $8 bi=
llion in non-core businesses that are performing "below acceptable rates" a=
nd would use the proceeds to pay off debts, although this money would proba=
bly not be immediately available.   Again, however, there is a perception e=
lement to this development that should be noted. Enron has been accused of =
financing partnerships in the past in such a way as to keep them off the co=
mpany's balance sheets. Apparently, this non-disclosure was done so that En=
ron could grow quickly without adding too much debt to its own books or dil=
uting the value of its stock. As has been well documented, Enron is already=
 in the midst of an intense SEC investigation regarding potential conflict-=
of-issues involving its former CFO. News about other financial deals that m=
ay not have been fully disclosed is clearly making investors even more nerv=
ous about Enron's stock.     As I said, the question of the hour is whether=
 or not Enron's new problems will cause Dynegy to reconsider its offer. As =
usual, the answer all depends on who you ask. Dynegy is remaining mum and r=
eferring all questions about Enron's financial status to Enron. Investors a=
re rather mixed on the question. Some say that the facts disclosed in the 1=
0-Q report do not dramatically change Enron's position from what it was whe=
n Dynegy launched its acquisition and that the current drop in Enron's stoc=
k is just a knee-jerk response to the media hype surrounding the story. Fur=
ther, those who diminish any potential impact say that Enron is still a liq=
uid company and has money coming in from various sources. Thus, it should h=
ave no trouble making the $690-million payment. From a broad perspective, s=
o one theory goes, Dynegy is still getting a great deal in Enron due to its=
 staggering drop in stock price, and the acquisition remains valuable to Dy=
negy as it will position the combined company as North America's biggest ma=
rketer and trader of natural gas and electricity.   In contrast, other inve=
stors point to the fact that since the purchase agreement was signed, Enron=
's stock has fallen an additional 32.5 percent, which weakens the original =
acquisition agreement. In addition, if Enron follows through with the $690-=
million payment next week or secures additional financing to front this cos=
t, both options alter the company's financial position from when Dynegy mad=
e its original offer, which could be construed as a "material adverse chang=
e."   Another interesting development indicates that Enron may no longer be=
 the company that Dynegy agreed to purchase. New reports indicate many ener=
gy trading companies are now unwilling to sell power or natural gas to Enro=
n for fear about the company's credit concerns. Such companies are now part=
icularly reticent to sell power to Enron for next-day delivery. What this m=
eans in practical terms is that other trading companies may be gaining Enro=
n's market share, which could diminish the value in the trading market that=
 had attracted Dynegy to Enron in the first place. In addition, Enron's onc=
e-stellar energy trading business could now become reduced or collapse alto=
gether.   Questions have been raised why Dynegy is not doing more at this t=
ime to help Enron out of its financial mess. Of course, under the acquisiti=
on agreement Dynegy already committed to providing an immediate $1.5-billio=
n asset-backed equity infusion into Enron to help the company with its curr=
ent financial woes, which will be followed by an additional infusion of $2.=
5 billion into the combined company by ChevronTexaco, which owns 27 percent=
 of Dynegy. However, some traders apparently have wondered why Dynegy has n=
ot done anything about Enron's diminishing ability to secure power on the o=
pen market. Traders claim that Dynegy could step in and buy power from sell=
ers on the behalf of Enron, in a strategy known as "sleeving." The fact tha=
t Dynegy has not chosen to take this step has been an indication to some ob=
servers that it is only willing to go so far in its pursuit of Enron.   In =
addition, Enron shareholders launched a lawsuit on Nov. 12 in state court i=
n Houston to prevent the merger with Dynegy from happening. The petition re=
portedly alleges that Enron directors breached their fiduciary duties by ag=
reeing to sell the company at too low a price and without adequate consider=
ation of other alternatives. Enron said it will defend its decision in cour=
t.    Moreover, Dynegy was smart to include an exit clause in the acquisiti=
on agreement. The clause reportedly allows Dynegy to walk away from Enron i=
f any material adverse change occurs related to the outcome of the SEC inve=
stigation, possible litigation against Enron, balance sheet strengths, and =
earnings forecasts. Certainly the latest developments disclosed in Enron's =
10-Q filing with the SEC impact the company's balance sheet strengths and e=
arnings forecasts, so a case could be made that Dynegy would have grounds t=
o terminate the acquisition. Clearly, this pending deal hinges on the devel=
opments that will take place over the next few weeks. Dynegy ultimately wil=
l have to weigh the pros and cons of its acquisition offer for Enron and de=
termine if the once-golden company still represents a great deal, or if pur=
suing the purchase would cause more trouble than it is worth.    An archive=
