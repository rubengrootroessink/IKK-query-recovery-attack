Hey Rick.  I am sorry that it won't work on your calendar.  I think Paul and I are going to go ahead and meet with him...we're concerned that his attentions are going to get very focused on the Olympics by the end of November and that we need to have a sit down with him to make sure that he is reminded about our positions now.

Rick/Paul---just got a call back from Max Farbman and he has been able to find another time on Governor Mike Leavitt's calendar for us to go see him in Salt Lake--Monday, Nov 5 from 3:00 to 4:00 pm.
 
Please let me know as soon as practical if you can/will attend.  Thanks.
