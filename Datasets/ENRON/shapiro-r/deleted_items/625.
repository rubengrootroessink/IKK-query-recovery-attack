Publisher's Note
================
Companies looking for even small amounts of risk capital know 
how difficult things are at the moment. Well, Europe's risk 
capital industry is likely to fall even further behind that of 
the United States without continued reform to improve investment 
and create an integrated cross-border market. The warning is 
contained in a review of the Risk Capital Action Plan (RCAP) 
just published by the Commission. Internal Market Commissioner 
Frits Bolkestein urges EU countries to press ahead with 
implementing the RCAP which is supposed to facilitate investment 
and stimulate risk capital.

The review highlights the slow headway being made by EU 
proposals such as those on an EU patent and on supplementary 
pension funds. It also shows that, while venture capital funds 
raised in Europe nearly doubled last year, investment by VCs in 
the US was four times larger than that in Europe. And corporate 
venturing - an increasingly important source of financing for 
entrepreneurs - remains only 20-25% of the level in the USA. We 
can only hope that Mr Bolkestein's confidence that "the European 
venture capital industry will emerge stronger and more 
competitive from the current cyclical downturn" is well placed.

1. European airlines say transatlantic traffic down by 36.2 pct
---------------------------------------------------------------
European airlines have seen a fall of 36.2 per cent in traffic 
over the North Atlantic since the September 11 attacks in the 
United States and a 9.6 per cent drop in traffic on European 
routes, says the Association of European Airlines. The 
association said that in the five weeks since the attacks the 
market had stabilised on transatlantic routes at about one third 
lower than the figure for the same period last year.

2. EU summit backs US in war aims, sees room for rate cuts
----------------------------------------------------------
At their second summit since the attacks on the US, EU leaders 
at the weekend reiterated their "staunchest" support for America 
in its military strikes on Afghanistan and labelled the 
elimination of the al-Qaeda network the legitimate and primary 
aim of the attacks.
Full story: http://www.eubusiness.com/item/60992 
The EU and the European Central Bank also found common ground on 
the possibility of an interest rate cut under the current 
economic trends.

3. MEPs overturn compromise on employee consultation
----------------------------------------------------
The European Parliament has backed tough amendments to a draft 
Directive requiring companies with at least 50 employees to 
consult them on changes in work organisation. MEPs are now 
likely to negotiate with the Council of Ministers to seek 
agreement on a final text. The vote rejected a compromise that 
would have allowed small companies in the UK and other countries 
with no such domestic legislation up to seven years to implement 
the measure.

4. EU candidates gain symbolic victory on cigarette taxes
---------------------------------------------------------
The Commission is to allow candidate countries to delay imposing 
high excise duties on cigarettes after enlargement. Tuesday's 
decision is important in that it marks the first time the EU has 
permitted candidate countries to deviate from EU norms -- albeit 
for a limited period of time -- in the key internal market 
sector.

5. Poland makes accession progress
----------------------------------
Poland wants to take part in the debate on the future of the EU 
on the same level as member countries, new Prime Minister Leszek 
Miller said on Thursday - a week after his ex-communist 
Democratic Left Alliance-led government was sworn into office.

Miller this week held talks with German Chancellor Gerhard 
Schroeder in a bid to reinvigorate moves towards Polish 
membership of the EU...

6. EU says Santa suit claim is so much Ho! Ho! Ho!
--------------------------------------------------
The Commission has rejected claims by British retailer 
Woolworths that it must sell Mother Christmas outfits because of 
EU law as "a marketing prank." "EU rules aim to prevent 
discrimination against female employees at work, and have 
nothing at all to do with the characteristics of goods sold in 
shops," said a Commission spokesman. In a press release Tuesday, 
Woolworths said "politically correct (gender) legislation from 
Brussels means that Woolworths stores are being made to 
stock 'Mother Christmas' outfits along with Father Christmas 
outfits."
