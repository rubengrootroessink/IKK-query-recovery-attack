Republican Gubernatorial candidate Bret Schundler again refused to come 
clean on his tax record with his latest duck and cover today during the 
Gubernatorial debate on WNBC-TV's Gabe Pressman Show.

Jim McGreevey pointed out that the average municipal property tax bill for a 
Jersey City home is $1,785, which means that one homeowner in Jersey City 
pays more than what two homeowners pay in Woodbridge, where the average 
municipal property tax bill is $771.  But, when given a chance to come clean 
on his true record, Schundler pleaded "not guilty."

Schundler's record on taxes speaks for itself.  He imposed an illegal 
payroll tax and raised property taxes five times while mayor of Jersey City. 
 Even though Schundler claims that he cut taxes while mayor of Jersey City, 
major news organizations, including the Bergen Record, the Associated Press, 
the New York Times and the Jersey Journal, say otherwise, exposing his true 
tax record.

* Payroll Tax:
Schundler actually created a brand-new tax while mayor of Jersey City - a 
payroll tax that was later ruled illegal.

- Schundler signed an ordinance to enact a payroll tax on Jersey City 
businesses.
"On December 6, 1995, the Council adopted Ordinance 95-117 imposing a 1% tax 
on certain payrolls... Acting under the authority of this ordinance, the 
Mayor has directed the Finance Department to collect the tax." [Source: 
letter to employers from the city Director of Finance, dated 3/20/96]

- Schundler said the city would need the revenues from the payroll tax for 
16 years.
"'We think we will have the tax refunds for the over-assessments paid in 
five years and then we can reduce the payroll tax to one-half percent.  The 
tax can be phased out completely by 2011,' Schundler said.'" [The Jersey 
Journal, 12/6/95]

Republicans joined Democrats to block Schundler's payroll tax, and Jim 
McGreevey voted against it. Schundler's payroll tax was ultimately ruled 
illegal, and a judge forced the city to return $2.85 million that was 
collected.
"Jersey City's retroactive payroll tax was declared illegal yesterday and 
thrown out by Superior Court judge who ordered the city to refund businesses 
the $2.85 million it had collected so far, plus interest." [Source: Jersey 
Journal, 5/18/96, article on Superior Court ruling]

* Property Taxes:
Bret Schundler raised Jersey City municipal property taxes by $181 for the 
average homeowner.
