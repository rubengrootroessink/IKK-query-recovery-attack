You mentioned the other week that there may be opportunities for Mustafa in North America - Canada specifically.  I have discussed the voluntary redundancy option with Mustafa in addition to possibilities elsewhere including the US and UK renewables commercial.  (The latter would be a particularly good transition in terms of not losing his experience to date to EEL)  I have, however, managed his expectations with respect to the likelihood of these possibilities for fear of offering false hope. His CV is attached below.

Will you be free later - it would be worth catching up on progress this week.

Regards

Paul
