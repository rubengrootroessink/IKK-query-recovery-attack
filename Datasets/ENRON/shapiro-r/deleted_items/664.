 Quote Of The Week <http://g.fool.com/art/email/subheaders/419x40QOTD.gif>	
"Smaller companies tend to be less widely followed on Wall Street, and many institutional investors simply don't bother to research investment opportunities presented by smaller companies. The smaller the pool of investors watching a particular company increases the likelihood of market inefficiencies, and market inefficiencies create golden investment opportunities for those who do their research." 
Paul Larson, "Eight Reasons to Love Small Caps" ? <http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=528418>

How to Be the Ideal You 
(financially speaking, that is)

Believe it or not, out of the hundreds of financial tasks out there, you are only a few steps away from your Ideal You. Run through the list below and check off each item that you've taken care of. Ultimately, this list will not only provide you with your own scorecard, but also the action steps to add that coveted checkmark.

1. 
Financial goals and a plan to reach them <http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=528419>You've certainly got things you want to accomplish in the future, right? College for the kids? A vacation home? An artfully sculpted septum? You won't get there dependably without a plan. Everything begins with a plan.

2. Debt reduction plan  <http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=528420>(if you are in debt)
There's no getting ahead with double-digit debt hanging over you. While you're not likely to pay it off all at once, you should at least have a plan of attack and a debt-free date set.

3. 
Three-month cash cushion <http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=528421>This protects both your budget and your stock portfolio should you be hit by unexpected big-ticket expenses -- or find yourself without a paycheck.

4. 
Life insurance <http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=528422>If other people -- like children, a spouse, or an elderly parent -- are counting on your future paychecks to make ends meet, get term (not whole or universal) life insurance. 

5. 
Disability insurance <http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=528423>You are far more likely to become disabled than to die during your working lifetime. Keep the paychecks coming in, even when you can't work.

Co-founders Tom and David Gardner outline the complete list of ten in their upcoming "What to Do Now" online seminar. The seminar also includes five investment ideas for the future and much more. Go here <http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=528424> for all the details.
