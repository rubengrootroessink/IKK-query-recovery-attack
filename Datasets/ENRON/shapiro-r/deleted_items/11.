FYI

Karen forwarded to me a voicemail from the Fort-Worth reporter listing the amounts that are being reported as returned:
- $20K from the RNC
- $60K from RGA

I haven't yet seen the checks, nor have I heard anything internally about their return.  Also, I checked SAP and the checks haven't been credited into the system.

I'll let you know when I learn anything further.
