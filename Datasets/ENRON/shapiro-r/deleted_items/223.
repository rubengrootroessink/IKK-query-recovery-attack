Briggs!!

FYI - I am off on vacation from the 1st to the 15th of September and then come back to a major
storm of work in Berlin in the run up to the Energy Act revision. 

Could we perhaps talk tomorrow to see where we stand on various pending items with Eon:

1. KY issues and whether we have a chance to intervene in the rate case.
2. VA intervention
3. Pol Action program being put together by Russ Kean
4. Reg Action program being put together by you and Robin N.
5. USTR - scope for "the squeeze" there and getting Zelig's staff engaged on this one.
6. Follow up (if any) with FERC
7. My next visit to the US - which will probably be early October (and what I should do)


It would be good to get Thompson on the line with us to discuss this

Also, what about costs (your time, Russ', and Akin Gumps) I would like
to free ride as much as possible.

When are you coming back to visit??
Take care

Hennemeyer
