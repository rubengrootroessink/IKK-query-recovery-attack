Hi Rick,

Sorry I wasn't able to get draft documents to you yesterday.  Meredith is waiting for one more piece from Quinn Gillespie, but hopes to have it shortly.  In the meantime, I put together a couple of very brief additions to the Q&A that went out Monday for her to look at.  As you know, she's swamped right now, and she hasn't been able to get back to me.  I'll still try to have something to you before the call tomorrow.

Sue
