It looks like the date of August 22 will no longer work.  Rick has received new budget dates and we need to hold this meeting earlier.  See below for new dates and let me how many of the dates will work for you.  Also, the rough draft information re: Proposed Budgets & Priorities that Rick requested will now be due on Wednesday, August 1st. (below are a few notes that I jotted down during the call)
______________________________________________________
Budgets - rough drafts of proposed budgets & priorities 

Personnel Issues- firmly identify head count for upcoming year; are folks fully utilized; in the right place; is it better to move if not in the right place; do you need more; do we have our best people focused on the high priorities?
______________________________________________________

Please look at the dates below and let me know ASAP which one's are best for you.

Dates:
August 8, 9, 10, 14, 15, 16 & 17.

Thanks and please call if you have any questions.
