I forgot to forward this to you yesterday--sorry!  


Success on many of our issues depends on the interplay of multiple political and regulatory institutions at both the federal and state levels.  Building on the success of our closely coordinated efforts in the California campaign, I am formalizing a new issue strategy group.  The purpose of the issue strategy group is (1) to work with individuals across government affairs to develop issue strategies that fully integrate our efforts in a variety of arenas;and (2) to assist with the implementation of those strategies.
