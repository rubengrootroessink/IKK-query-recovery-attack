Hi Cindy.  I got a call on Friday afternoon from Utah Governor Leavitt's office asking if Mr. Lay would be willing to participate in a reception in Houston in early December for the Olympic torch relay.  They are also looking for names of other people in Enron management that should be invited. I seem to recall that Ken and/or Enron has been involved in some fashion with the Olympics in the past, and I thought you'd be the person that would know--hence this e mail.  I'd like to talk to you before I call them back.

I'll give you a call tomorrow to give you more details or feel free to buzz me if you have time.  #612-339-4599  thanks.
