We have not been able to reach anyone on Capitol Hill since Wednesday, as the Senate and House offices are all shut down.  Consequently, the Hill meetings we were working on for your visit next week are still very much up in the air.  We hope to lock this down once folks return to the Senate on Monday and the House on Tuesday.  Thanks for your indulgence.
