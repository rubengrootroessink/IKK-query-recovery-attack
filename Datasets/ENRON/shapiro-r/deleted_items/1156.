Attached is the revised Corporate Allocation worksheet.  Corporate cost center budgets will be reviewed with senior management on Tuesday, Sept. 11.  We do not expect significant changes to the allocations, and any additional changes will be communicated to you for inclusion in your business unit's plan.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
