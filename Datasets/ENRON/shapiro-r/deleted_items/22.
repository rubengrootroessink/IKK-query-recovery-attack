Gentlemen: . While I'm still at Enron( one of the few), I am diligently
developing future opportunities for myself in the wake of the
unfortunate events at Enron. Since I can't help but read great things
about your company, I thought I would send you a short note to determine
if Anadarko  might have any interest in someone with a strong
government/regulatory affairs background. While I'm assessing a few
offers at the moment, they are out of Texas and would require
relocation. My desire is to stay here. I'm good at what I do; my style
at Enron was very different from the reputation of the company( low key,
but effective); and the idea of applying my skills in a new setting is
quite appealing. I know Anadarko  has constant interaction with varrious
facets of government, but I don't fully know how you currently staff
those needs and whether someone with my background could be of
use...Thus my note. Below are various ways to contact me if there is any
interest. Thanks for taking the time to consider this note and Happy
Holidays...Rick Shapiro
