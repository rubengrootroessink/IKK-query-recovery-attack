Thank you, Rick.  I asked you by e-mail instead of calling you since I know how very busy your schedule is at this time.

Hi Rick:

During our conversation, you offered to write a letter of recommendation.  I would like to ask if you could please do that for me.  It would be very much appreciated.

Thank you.
