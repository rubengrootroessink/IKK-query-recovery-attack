Sergio. 

Now we need to research how lasting this effect will be (given that the Congress is unlikely to pass this into a permanent law). In other words, the defenses against potential challenges.

Current Scenario. The MP will have to be reissued every month

New Scenario.- The MP has to be passed into law within (90-120 days?). No extensions

The key question -- From the auditors perspective, will this be considered a reliablle solution?

Jose

The Federal Government  just  issue  Medida Provisoria no. 2227 (  it has law effects) creating a legal environment  to allow  tracking account  to cover costs included in Parcel A  (non controllable costs).  ANEEL is in charge of  to rule  all details of this recent mesure.

It  represents  a reward to our efforts.    LET's celebrate!
