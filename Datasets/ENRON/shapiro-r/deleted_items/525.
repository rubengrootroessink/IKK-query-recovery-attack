Hi Rick,

I just met with Meredith Philipp about our external communcations.  She has given me some draft documents for the group that I'll review today.  We'll try to get a final version to you by the end of the day.  They will address various settings, such as panels and roundtable discussions, as well as media.  I think the timing is great, as we are currently the subject of so much interest.  It's feeling like we've moved into a period of crisis management, and people in our group may be put on the spot.  These documents don't go to the issues of the day--just general guidelines for our interactions wherever they may be.

I also mentioned to her that people in our group could use a plain-english briefing on what's going on with investors right now, so that they don't sound uninformed when people ask them about it.  She agreed that it would be good to give people a briefing, and suggested that maybe Mark or Karen could participate in your call on Friday to do that.  Let me know what you think.

Hope DC is more pleasant than 1400 Smith St. is today.  Take care,

Sue
