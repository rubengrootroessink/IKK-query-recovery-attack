 INDUSTRY BRIEFS 		 
Education & Government
Despite the economic downturn and the flat job market in North America, the employment outlook in Education & Government remains strong. Some highlights:

Education: In light of the current economic situation, many recent college graduates are opting to go back to graduate school rather than face the job market. In addition, many professionals -- some left jobless after the technology fall out -- are reassessing their priorities and going back to school to pursue interests that had been put on hold during the get-rich-quick late-90s. Both groups are banking on an economic turnaround by graduation time. In the meantime, their renewed interest in school means continued opportunities in the Education marketplace. 

Government: Due to the Bush administration's policies and the war on terrorism, there has been an increase in defense and security funding, and the job market in both sectors should remain strong in the coming months.

Association & Non-Profit
There has been such an outpouring of donations for victims of the terrorist attacks that many associations and non-profits have redoubled their fundraising efforts to compete. Afraid to come off as insensitive or unpatriotic, many organizations encourage donations to the various September 11 funds while asking for continued support to their funds. To compound the situation, the investment portfolios of many organizations have taken a pounding because of the decline in equity markets. 

 NEWS & VIEWS 		 
Thinking About an MBA? 
Going back to school. The thought conjures up serene campuses, summer vacations and a laid-back lifestyle. After several years of 60-hour workweeks, heading back to class might sound like a much-needed two-year break. And, hey, MBA grads can command six-figure salaries. But are you really ready to exchange your salary and briefcase for a backpack and student loans? Here's what to consider when thinking about going back to school.
