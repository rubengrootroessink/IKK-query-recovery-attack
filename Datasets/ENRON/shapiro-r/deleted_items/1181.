Rick:

Please find attached the first cut of the suggested structure.  Honestly, this was a surprisingly difficult task. 

The first cut, page one, is close to what is currently on the ground making the regions reporting to the head of the "Electricity & Gas".  The regions shall be divided-temporarily-into "wholesale" and "retail" by ISO regions.  This is because the skill set between "wholesale", and "retail" are different, and some time is required for them to converge (perhaps, 6 to 9 months) into one group.   


 
However, this suggestion does not address two concerns, namely,:
1.	How to bring Federal Government Affairs to focus on Electricity & Gas needs (mainly FERC).
2.	How to address the regional needs of Global Markets and EBS.

The second suggestion, addresses the first point by dividing Federal Government Affairs into two sections.  One section-mainly political relationship management-remains as suggested in slide one, taking FERC Government Affairs and put it under "Energy Business".  This avoids "dotting reporting lines" phenomenon which-in my opinion- is less effective.  

 Of course, Energy Business can bring the suggested components into one block of skill pool very similar to a consultancy model.  In which case, the entire group, as in slide three, will be inside one box, possibly making the implementation easier among the whole group.  The components of the box (i.e., the skill set required), however, will be the same as in slide 2.  The consulting structure can also address the regional needs of Global Markets and EBS, which are not envisaged to be substantial.

I would like to discuss this further with you and take it from there. 
Kindly advise.
