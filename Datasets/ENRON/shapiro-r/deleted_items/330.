US crude oil inventory information is compiled by API and by the US EIA DOE.  Both utilize information collected from company surveys along with their own estimation methodologies.  A recent EIA DOE report (attached) lists the information forms from which the EIA DOE collects data.  A summary of API sources of data, collecting and auditing procedures, and estimation methodology utilized in publishing the API Weekly Statistical Bulletin can be obtained from API for $52.  Please advise if you wish to obtain this API report.
