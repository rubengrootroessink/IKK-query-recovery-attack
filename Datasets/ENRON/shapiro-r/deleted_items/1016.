Hi Rick.  Are you going to Colorado Springs for Thanksgiving?  I am going to Boulder.  My godson is in his senior year, so a few of us are heading out to have him serve us some turkey....then attending the Nebraska/Colorado game.  Should be some fun. I thought if you were traveling in that direction I might see you in the airport!
