Attached is EPSA's motion to intervene and protest in the TRANSLink ITC filing (Docket Nos. ER01-3154-000 and EC01-156-000).  The draft primarily focuses on independence and governance issues, but also highlights the TRANSLink tariff, congestion management, and planning and expansion aspects of the filing.

We'll also discuss the draft on a conference call scheduled for Tuesday, November 27th, at 11:30 A.M. (EST).  To access the call, dial 1-800-937-6563.  Ask for the Erin Perrigo/EPSA Call.
