Rober, Rick, Paul:

Belden's asked me to prepare a presentation early next week on the merger to the Portland staff re: the merger.

If you have any charts/timelines that list the approvals needed and any codes of conduct that will be in place during the transition (e.g. the "don't" list), I would appreciate getting a copy.   

Thank you,

Alan Comnes
