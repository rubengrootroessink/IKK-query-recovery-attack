Effective today, I am designating Janel Guerrero as the primary point person for Enron's comprehensive RTO efforts.  In this capacity, she will be coordinating all of the advocacy functions outside of the FERC mediation process. This effort is absolutely of the highest priority for the company. Please cooperate with Janel to the fullest and coordinate with her  on all of your strategic efforts and communications that are related to the RTO effort.
 
Thanks very much.
 
Additional details regarding our RTO campaign will be emailed to you later today.
