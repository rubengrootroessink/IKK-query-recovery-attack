Rick,
 
I'm sending you an initial list of observations/frustrations related to the RTO effort that are going to need to be addressed very soon if we're going to be successful.
 

Public Affairs needs to get engaged in this effort.  Jim and Christi have set high expectations for how we deal with RTOs in the media.  Mark has designated Meredith P as the point person in Houston.  She is interested and getting up to speed.  Pat - while probably very capable - is slow to respond to deliverables and his prep work isn't up to par.  My gut feeling is to designate Meredith and let me and Sue work directly with her on this.  I need someone who is consistently available and who will meet the deadlines I set.
The Northeast group needs to engage.  I have no idea what meetings have been set up with regulators or what feedback people are hearing.  Everyone else (Dan Staines, Marchris, John Shelk, Sue Landwehr, Janine, Christi, Sarah, are all totally engaged).  The Northeast needs to be more of a team player in this effort.
RTO Database - Amr is in charge of the technical aspect of the database, but I've explained to Elizabeth that I want ALL RTO information (technical and otherwise) in one place....we decided LIVELINK would be the best place for this.  It doesn't seem to be moving however.  I've asked for updates/timeframe when we can get LIVELINK up and running for our RTO effort (I want an RTO calendar, a place for internal and external documents, filings, etc) and am not sure what's going on with it.  The database is really important because there is SOOOO much information out there that we need to keep tabs on.  Getting an RTO LIVELINK effort up and running is something that needs to happen soon.
