Orlando. I will participate in an energy panel. See the text below for the messages and let me know if there is some else that you woulf like me to stress.

 

I decided to keep it at a high level, discuss the key root causes, and ask "what next'"?

The main theme is trade issues "Brazil, the US. and FTAA. Energy is a subtopic.

Francisco Gros is exepect to participate in the panel via videoconfernce.

Jose
