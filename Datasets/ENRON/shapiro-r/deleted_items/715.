NEW JERSEY NEWSPAPERS:
McGREEVEY CLEAR CHOICE FOR GOVERNOR

Every major newspaper in the New Jersey area, including the Newark 
Star-Ledger, the Bergen Record, the New York Times and the Philadelphia 
Inquirer, have endorsed Jim McGreevey for Governor. The papers said 
McGreevey's responsible approach for improving public schools, tackling auto 
insurance rates and making sure state government is managed well make him 
the right choice to lead New Jersey during the next four years.

The papers also drew the stark contrast between McGreevey and Bret Schundler 
on major issues of concern to New Jersey's families - fighting for public 
schools vs. abandoning them with a reckless private school voucher scheme; 
fighting for good drivers vs. letting auto insurance companies decide rates; 
protecting a woman's right to choose vs. making abortion illegal even in the 
cases of rape and incest, and; protecting New Jersey's tough gun laws vs. 
allowing people to carry concealed weapons.

"The endorsements of every major newspaper show that Jim McGreevey is the 
only candidate for Governor who will fight for New Jersey's families, and 
that he shares their values on critical issues - improving public schools, 
fighting for drivers not auto insurance companies, making sure that 
government lives within its means, protecting a woman's right to choose and 
keeping concealed guns out of our communities," said Steve DeMicco, 
McGreevey for Governor campaign director.
