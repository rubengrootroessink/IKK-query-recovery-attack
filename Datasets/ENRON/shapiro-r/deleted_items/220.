Stephanie - I've been talking with Carol Carter in EWS Accounting and coordinating with Rick Shapiro on the Public Affairs side regarding Rebecca Cantrell and Melinda Pharms.

Rick understood that when Rebecca and Melinda moved to the 47th floor was that EWS had budgeted for them for 2001, that they would remain in that existing EWS cost center through 2001, and would then move to our corporate cost center in 2002.

Rebecca and Melinda have provided and continue to provide a vital service.  Assuming that the associated budget would have been eliminated when they moved, does that also mean they would have been terminated?

As a compromise, Rick has agreed to the suggestion of moving Rebecca and Melinda (and their associated expenses) into the corporate cost center effective 10/1/01 instead of 01/01/02, with the understanding that the $281K that's been incurred so far remains with EWS.

I'd be happy to provide any further information that might be helpful, and to take care of any details involved in moving them to Corp.

Regards,
Elizabeth Linnell
