Ana - Thanks for keeping me updated on the $ moves.  I've been working with HR to have Rebeccan and Melinda moved to another cost center effective 10/1, so that should be taken care of.
Thanks,
Elizabeth

Thanks Elizabeth.  I will let you know how much I am moving over into your cost center.  Also, before October payroll runs, I need to work with you or whomever to make sure that the employees in that cost center are moved over to 0011/100108.

Thanks
Ana

Carol - After exchanging lots of e-mails, and Rick speaking with Julie Gomez, it's been agreed that the costs applied to 413/106799 should be moved to 0011/100108.

Please let me know if you need any further information.

Thanks!
