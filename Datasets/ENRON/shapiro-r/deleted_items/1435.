On my last visit to London, I met with John Sherriff & Richard Lewis separa=
tely and discussed the possibility of naming a team leader within the Enron=
 Europe Government Affairs group.  The purpose of naming a team leader woul=
d be to provide more consistent leadership for the group on a day-to-day ba=
sis, principally on personnel issues, but also to ensure that a consistent =
policy approach is being taken across the Government Affairs group on issue=
s that affect the company.  I know that John is ambivalent about naming suc=
h a team leader, but I thought that I would make the case once again, and, =
hopefully in a more compelling manner so we can move forward with this idea=
.

First, it is important to say what the designation of a team leader would n=
ot do.  It would not, in my estimation, change the nature of the reporting =
relationships that we currently have relative to Eric Shaw, Richard Lewis a=
nd myself.  Peter Styles and Paul Hennemeyer will continue to report to Eri=
c Shaw and myself, and Paul Dawson and Doug Wood would continue to report t=
o Richard Lewis and myself.   Second, as the unchanged nature of the report=
ing relationships indicate, this change is in no way intended to diminish t=
he role of Eric and/or Richard relative to the management of the Government=
 Affairs group, but merely to ensure that someone is tending to personnel, =
administrative and group management issues on a daily basis.  Third, by nam=
ing a team leader within the Government Affairs group, I am not attempting,=
 in any way, to step back from the role that I personally have taken on rel=
ative to the group - I will continue to provide strategic guidance (where I=
 can) and also will continue to ensure that the Enron Europe Government Aff=
airs group is fully integrated within the global government affairs functio=
n so that the Europe group is the beneficiary of knowledge and information =
that is developed around the world within the government affairs function.

The intent of designating a team leader, as already stated, is merely to en=
sure that issues related to the administration of the group, consistency of=
 external advocacy, and personnel issues are handled on a timely and effect=
ive basis.  While I believe there have been many benefits from the current =
organizational structure, one of the significant and increasingly more noti=
ceable negatives has been that there has not always been a consistent and f=
air approach to the handling of personnel issues within the group (notwiths=
tanding my best efforts to deal with these issues from a distance).  This h=
as resulted in, what I consider to be, the sub-optimal handling of at least=
 one employee who is in the process of being terminated, as well as inconsi=
stent messaging to many of the junior people within the group in terms of w=
hat their career opportunities are within the larger government affairs fun=
ction in Europe (which, in turn, has created issues of morale).  These issu=
es, in my mind, are of sufficient concern that, if left unaddressed, the gr=
oup's ability to sustain a record of providing excellent support throughout=
 the organization may, in time, be in jeopardy.  I am confident that, by na=
ming a team leader, we will retain virtually all of the benefits of the col=
lective leadership approach that are embodied in the current structure, chi=
ef among them,  greater participation from both Eric and Richard on an ongo=
ing basis.  What we will gain, however, by the designation of a team leader=
, is increased and sustained attention to the issues that I have already me=
ntioned. =20

The person that I believe is best suited for this team leadership role is P=
aul Dawson. =20
My observations, relative to Paul, are that he understands the needs of the=
 individuals within the group and will do everything that he can to ensure =
that personnel issues are handled in a fair and expeditious manner.  In add=
ition, Paul has a very sound grasp of many, if not all, of the issues facin=
g Enron Europe and will provide, I believe, consistent leadership on substa=
nce as well as on personnel and administrative issues.  It is also my expec=
tation that Doug Wood, who has assumed many of the administrative responsib=
ilities, e.g., budget, will continue to assist Paul in that capacity and th=
at both Peter Styles and Paul Hennemeyer will also continue to participate =
in a leadership role along with Paul Dawson and Doug.

I believe that this is the right approach to take and it is my hope that on=
 my next trip to London, in mid September, that I would be able to sit down=
 with Paul Dawson, Paul Hennemeyer, Peter Styles and Doug Wood with any com=
bination of yourselves, and lay out the modest organizational change embodi=
ed within this memorandum.  If you have any questions, please feel free to =
contact me.

Thanks
