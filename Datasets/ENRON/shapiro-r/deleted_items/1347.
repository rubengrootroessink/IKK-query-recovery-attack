Subject:=09The aftermath of September 11th -- Enron Government Affairs


    The events of September 11th are still very much with us and will conti=
nue to be for some time, perhaps for as long as we live. For those who have=
 not heard me say this regarding air travel,individuals should avail themse=
lves of the travel services the company is offering in the way of guidance =
for those that are traveling and only travel by air for essential matters( =
until further notice). In addition, anyone who is currently  uncomfortable =
with the notion of air travel  need not do so...we will work around this fo=
r as long as the need exists. The company has also provided information on =
the availability of counseling services should anyone have the need- please=
 contact HR or the Benefits Group for further information.
     A final couple of notes: If there is a silver lining in the events of =
September 11th, it is the kindness, generosity, and humanity it brings out =
in the rest of us...I have seen this play out in untold ways in our "group"=
,both in London and at home,  over the last nine days , including( to a per=
son) the absence of any hint of bias being shown towards the individual in =
our group who is an "Arab American" and a Muslim, Amr Ibrahim. My high rega=
rd and respect for the Government Affairs group and for each individual  ha=
s been validated many times over  during the past nine days. Thank you very=
 much.--- Rick Shapiro

I really appreciate your note.  Beth continues to have concerns with the no=
tion of me getting on an airplane ... a fact that comes out in interesting =
ways during the day.  Thank you for giving us an opportunity to let the dis=
comfort pass or lessen. =20

It's always been hard to determine what is essential vs. nonessential trave=
l.  Our jobs involve personal touch and contact.  We can't stay off of airp=
lanes for very long without compromising some of our effectiveness.  On the=
 positive side, very few of our elected friends outside of California are e=
ven thinking about energy issues.

I've done a good job of clearing the calendar for the next two weeks, but I=
'm already booking trips the first week of October.  Hopefully the world wi=
ll be calm during the interim and we can all get back to some semblance of =
normalcy. =20

Dear Rick,
 I understand that this is a very sad time for You (and for us) all and I
imagine that there can't be only work to talk about; however I want to than=
k
You all for the attentions You paid to me; I had a big chance to understand
(of course broadly) your business as a trader; what I learned will help me
greatly in managing the task of I'm facing in my position here at the
Acquirente Unico.
I really appreciate your hospitality; I knew Enron was the best company in
energy trading, but now I'm impressed in finding out that the Enron people
are not only skilled and cleaver but so kind and friendly too. I want You t=
o
know that Vinio (he is a very good guy, and I'm so happy I met him), Alfred=
o
(words are not needed about Alfredo), Ginger especially (You're very lucky
having an assistant as Ginger, but what about the luck of them all in havin=
g
a boss like You are?) and, needless to say, everybody made me understand wh=
y
Enron is one of the best company to work for.

I'm looking forward to see You in Italy

Best regards

Federico
