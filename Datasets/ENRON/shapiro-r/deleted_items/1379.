Rick

Unfortunately, as  consequence of Enron problems,  today we just start a headcount reduction in Sao Paulo office.  Our  regulatory  team will be composed by myself, Fred Sampaio and Luiz Baccaro, dealing with Enron Merchant interests and Elektro also.  Jos? Lucio will  work us  until completion Cuiaba (aprox more 1 or 2 month).

I know you are facing same difficult in Houston, so hope everything is OK with your team and you also!  

Thanks
