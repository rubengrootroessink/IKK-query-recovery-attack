A few months ago, I sent a note to the North American Government Affairs gr=
oup commemorating a bit of an end point in our efforts relative to Californ=
ia.  In that memo, I included a quote that went as follows ? "What we do in=
 life echoes through eternity".  I think of these words often and believe t=
hem more than ever, particularly after the events, both external and intern=
al to Enron, of the last few months.  I do not know for sure what the next =
few weeks or months will bring for any of us, but I do know that what we've=
 done here at Enron in Government Affairs over the last several years, whet=
her in Houston, Washington, London, Brussels, Sao Paulo, etc. was very good=
 and will be remembered for the positive difference that we have all made i=
n the industries in which we have worked and for each other.  We even had a=
 good time doing it.  The good work we do will go on for many, if not, all =
of us . . . for some, here; for others, elsewhere. =20

Regardless of what the future holds, we should all be quite proud of what w=
e have accomplished here and how it has been accomplished.  My personal app=
reciation for all that you have done as well as at having had the opportuni=
ty to be part of a group that, unfortunately, will be inalterably impacted =
and changed over the next few weeks, is boundless.  Irrespective of where t=
hese changes may take any one of us, I will continue to do all I can to ear=
n your trust and respect. =20

On a more holiday-related note, for those in the U.S., who are working this=
 week, please feel free to leave as early as possible on Wednesday in advan=
ce of Thanksgiving to spend time with your families or loved ones.  For tho=
se not celebrating the American Thanksgiving, you too should try and take s=
ome additional time for yourself and families over the next few days, work =
and business demands permitting.

Thank you.

Hello Rick.  I didn't get a chance to tell you in person - Thank You.  It m=
eant alot to me and I'm sure everyone else on how you handled Enron's "issu=
es" and the Sept. 11th event.  I think this showed to me your true compassi=
on and explains the loyalty that your employees have for you. =20

When I grow up, I want to be just like you.  :-) =20

Again, Thanks and it was very much appreciated.

Dear Rick,

In September, I started a new job with another electric cooperative in Nort=
h
Alabama near Decatur and Huntsville. It is Joe Wheeler EMC, a TVA
distributor. We have about 39,000 customers in 2 counties south of
Huntsville. This had been a troubled cooperative and had seen a huge
management and board shake-up. I hope that between my efforts and having a
few new board members that things will smooth out here.

I am sure saddened to see all of the stuff hit the fan at Enron. I had
actually bought more stock several weeks ago in the belief that this whole
thing was a fluke. I like many others are reminded that the market is a ver=
y
fickle animal indeed. I hope that you and the old group are being seen as
part of the core business. I don't think that anyone would say that ENE did
not have an effective government relations group.

Best Wishes,
George Kitchens

Hi Rick:

Thank you for the kind message that you left on my voicemail on Friday=20
evening.  I apologize that I got choked up when I was leaving.  Saying=20
goodbye to good friends is not easy.

This is my new personal email address.  Please drop me a line every now and=
=20
then to let me know how you're doing.

I hope to see you soon.

Lisa

I just wanted to convey my thanks for your keeping us updated through this =
tough time.  Although the news often wasn't good, it was helpful to hear.  =
I can't tell you how much I appreciate the level of communication to our gr=
oup - many friends and colleagues throughout the company truly had no idea =
what was going on because their superiors were not keeping them informed. =
=20

Again, thanks very much.  I hope we have much brighter days ahead.

We have never met, but I currently head up Government Affairs on a global b=
asis for Enron, whose news I'm sure each of you have heard about in recent =
days. Naturally, I am reassessing the future and believe my deep understand=
ing of the energy industry and the governmental/regulatory landscape that s=
urrounds that industry could be quite helpful to UBS Warburg in being bette=
r able to serve your clients by better understanding the energy equities. I=
 know this is a stretch, but talk to me, meet me...I know I can convince yo=
u of my value. I can be reached at 713-853-3407 in addition to e-mail. Than=
ks for your time and consideration.
