NGA Outlines Vision For 2001-2002=20

"The dawning of this new century and the convergence of globalization, tech=
nology, and deregulation have forced governors to ask important questions a=
bout the best way to govern. We are discovering the answers. In the 21st ce=
ntury, state leadership will be decisive."

Michigan Governor John Engler
NGA Chairman, 2001-2002

In response to recent challenges, state leadership is already rethinking go=
vernment and implementing the following strategies:

Regarding families, the states are making strategic investments in the basi=
c unit of society. These include providing lifelong learning opportunities =
and incentives for personal responsibility and self-sufficiency. NGA's stra=
tegies nurture civil society and encourage the kind of social and intellect=
ual infrastructure needed for the 21st century.

NGA activities to support this legislative agenda include:

State Roundtables
Capitol Hill Forums
Site Visit Program
NGA Policy


Regarding the economy, the states are strengthening American competitive ad=
vantage in the world. By reshaping each state's economic environment to enc=
ourage clusters of innovation, governors are building a stronger national e=
conomy and states are prospering in the global marketplace.

NGA will support this competitiveness initiative through:

Policy Briefs
Clusters of Innovation Conference
Regional Forums


Regarding government, the states are reengineering the public sector to be =
more flexible, adaptable, customer-oriented, and performance driven. This m=
eans focusing on results, decentralizing decision making, and using technol=
ogy to improve services.

As a Corporate Fellow, your organization will have a unique opportunity to =
participate and share in the dialogue that emerges from NGA's vision for 20=
01-2002. Through briefings with NGA senior staff, participation in Corporat=
e Fellow advisory groups, and attendance at the NGA's Winter and Annual Mee=
tings, your organization can share with the NGA in the fulfillment of its v=
ision and contribute to better government.

Corporate Fellows Advisory Groups=20

With the support and involvement of the Corporate Fellows, the NGA Center f=

ssons can be learned from others grappling with similar problems and issues=
. These advisory groups (education, eGovernance, employment & social servic=
es, health and natural resources) meet during the Winter and Annual Meeting=
s to discuss the year's work-plan and the role of Corporate Fellows; regula=
r meetings of the Corporate Fellows' advisory groups take place throughout =
the year. If your organization is not involved in an advisory group and wou=
ld like to join one, please contact Denise Harrison <mailto:dharrison@nga.o=
