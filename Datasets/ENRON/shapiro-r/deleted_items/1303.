TELECOM REGULATION
************************************************************
VERIZON SEEKS FCC APPROVAL
FOR RHODE ISLAND InterLATA BID

Verizon Communications, Inc., has asked the FCC to allow it to
offer in-region interLATA (local access and transport area)
services in Rhode Island -- the fifth state for which Verizon has
sought such approval.  Its previous four applications, covering
New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania, received
the FCC's OK.

The Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission endorsed Verizon's
application earlier this month.  The FCC must consider the views
of the PUC and the U.S. Department of Justice as it evaluates
whether Verizon should be cleared to offer in-region interLATA
services.  Section 271 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996
allows Bell operating companies to offer in-region interLATA
services in a state once the FCC finds they've met a 14-point
"competitive checklist" of market-opening requirements.

Verizon said KPMG Consulting had found that the telephone
company's operation support systems (OSSs) in Rhode Island were
the same as those it used in Massachusetts.  The FCC already has
found Verizon's OSS in Massachusetts acceptable in a previous
section 271 application.  Competing carriers serve more than
120,000 local phone lines in Rhode Island, Verizon said.

The FCC said it would hold ex parte meetings related to comments
on Verizon's petition on Dec. 12 and 13.  Comments from interest-
ed parties and the Rhode Island PUC in the Common Carrier docket
01-324 proceeding will be due Dec. 17.  Justice's evaluation is
due Jan. 4, 2002.  Ex parte meetings related to reply comments
will be held Jan. 7 and 8, 2002, and replies will be due Jan. 10,
2002.  The FCC's statutory deadline for acting on the application
is Feb. 24, 2002. -- Brian Hammond, bhammond@tr.com

FURTHER TELECOM LIBERALIZATION SET FOR 2003, 
SLOVAKIA PROCEEDS TOWARD EU ACCESSION

The Slovak Republic has made big strides in transforming to a
market economy over the last six years, according to a World
Trade Organization trade policy review body.  "Slovakia's accel-
erated economic transition has intensified its preparations for
EU [European Union] accession.  This will provide renewed oppor-
tunities and benefits to Slovakia and its trading partners," the
TPRB said.

Slovakia is gearing up for accession to the European Union in
2004.  To more closely match with EU policies, Slovakia has
increasingly liberalized its trade and investment policies, the
review body said.  It found that foreign investment increased to
10% of gross domestic product in 2000, up from 3.5% of GDP in
1999.  The TPRB periodically reviews members' implementation of
WTO trade policy objectives with input from the WTO secretariat
and the member government's own policy statement.  Slovakia's
second TPRB review was completed Nov. 23.

"The private sector now accounts for 80% of GDP and has become
the main source of growth for Slovakia," the report said. 
Regulatory authorities are being established in key services to
facilitate privatization, and safeguard competition, it noted. 
Slovakia Telecom recently divested 51% of its ownership overseas,
and the republic created a Telecommunications Office in July
2000, the body noted.

"The sector is to be further liberalized from 2003 when the state
monopoly over basic telecommunications using the public fixed
network is due to end.  The Telecommunications Act of 2000
provides licensed entrants from 2003 with non-discriminatory
access to the public network within a reasonable time at a price
based on justified costs," the body said.  Slovakia also is set
to implement universal service mechanisms, it added.

Slovakia also is crafting competition legislation along EU lines
with greater independence given to its antimonopoly office. 
Price fixing is banned, as is abuse of dominant market power by
companies not subject to "substantial" competition, it said. 
Slovak law prohibits mergers if they create or strengthen a
firm's dominant market position in a way that reduces competi-
tion, according to the report.

Privatization remains a key policy objective for the Slovak
Republic.  Since 1999, the privatization initiative has been
revitalized and made more transparent, the report noted.  State-
owned monopolies are no longer excluded from privatization but
private ownership limits apply to a few state-owned enterprises,
such as 34% in telecommunication, banking, and insurance markets,
the report said. -- Ed Rovetto, erovetto@tr.com

CompTel ASKS FCC TO SET GUIDELINES 
FOR TRIENNIAL UNE REVIEW

The FCC said in a 1999 order that it would review its rules on
unbundled network elements (UNEs) every three years.  Now, the
Competitive Telecommunications Association wants the FCC to
establish "procompetitive procedures and standards" for conduct-
ing such reviews.

CompTel President H. Russell Frisby Jr. said carriers have
"wasted vast amounts of time and resources fighting premature
attempts" by incumbent local exchange carriers to convince the
FCC to eliminate some elements from the national list of UNEs
that ILECs must offer to competitors.

CompTel recommended that the FCC establish May 18, 2003 as the
"earliest date upon which any party could file a petition to have
a UNE removed from the mandatory list."  It also recommended the
FCC convene a federal-state joint conference to get feedback from
the states on UNE issues.  

CompTel added that the FCC should "clarify that the three-year
UNE review is not an inquiry into all national UNEs, so any party
seeking to scale back or remove a UNE" from the FCC's mandated
list "bears the burden of proof."  Finally, it asked the FCC to
announce that it would "not consider removing or scaling back"
the availability of a UNE "if the requesting ILEC has not com-
plied with its obligation to provide the UNE for a commercially
reasonable period of time." -- Brian Hammond, bhammond@tr.com

Z-TEL STUDY: FCC RULES LIMIT COMPETITION -- 
Z-Tel Communications, Inc., says that if FCC restrictions on the
availability of unbundled local switching were not in place,
competitive local exchange carriers could serve 60% more mass-
market customers.  That was one of the conclusions in an economic
study that Z-Tel filed with the FCC Nov. 21 in Common Carrier
docket 96-98 aiming to demonstrate the need to eliminate the
restrictions on unbundled local switching.  The rules under
attack by Z-Tel state that incumbent local exchange carriers
don't have to provide unbundled local switching to competing
carriers for use in serving customers (1) with three or more
lines and (2) located in the top-50 U.S. markets.  The study is
available at Z-Tel's Web site at www.ztel.com.

DEC. 19 DEADLINE FOR NTIA BROADBAND COMMENTS -- 
The deadline for submitting comments to the National Telecommuni-
cations and Information Administration on broadband deployment in
the U.S. is Dec. 19, not Dec. 14 as published in the Nov. 19
edition of the "Federal Register."  NTIA has asked for comments
on several issues, including supply and demand for broadband
services and the technical, economic, or regulatory barriers to
broadband deployment.  Filings should reference docket 011109273-
1273-01.

TELECOM STOCKS BOUNCE BACK IN EUROPE,
BUT DON'T EXPECT SAME IN U.S., ANALYSTS SAY

A recent rally in the stocks of European telecom carriers isn't
likely to spread to this side of the Atlantic, analysts from
Goldman, Sachs & Co. said today.  Several factors in the past
four to six weeks have improved investor sentiment toward Europe-
an carriers, but a different set of forces is at work in the
U.S., analysts said today during a conference call with clients.

For example, competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs) have all
but disappeared in Europe, leaving incumbents stronger.  Despite
the decline of CLECs in the U.S., that sector remains a competi-
tive threat to incumbents, analyst Frank J. Governali said. 
"CLECs still are playing a role here."

Investor sentiment in Europe also has been buoyed by carriers'
debt-reduction efforts, Goldman Sachs analyst James Sawtell said. 
KPN NV, for example, last week launched plans to raise about $4.5
billion for debt reduction through the sale of stock (TRDaily,
Nov. 21).  Sonera recently made similar moves.  While many U.S.
carriers have large debt loads, the problem was more acute in
Europe, where carriers paid dearly for licenses to offer third-
generation wireless services.

U.S. carriers continue to suffer from factors that are less
evident in Europe, such as service cannibalization, Mr. Governali
asserted.  In the U.S., a significant number of younger consumers
are using wireless service rather than wireline service when they
establish a new household, he said.  In Europe, however, wireless
service generally is more expensive than in the U.S., and wire-
line service is less costly.  That dampens the effects of canni-
balization, he said.

But some analysts think European wireless rates are due to fall. 
With several new entrants lined up to launch service in some
countries, competition could lead to a price war.  Mr. Sawtell
suggested that some smaller operators might launch aggressive
pricing plans "as a last roll of the dice" if other tactics
failed to generate market share for them.

At the same time, he said, many smaller operators don't have the
financial resources or confidence for a sustained price war. 
"They run the risk of debasing the market to everyone's detri-
ment, including their own," he said.

While European carriers bask in a renewal of investor confidence,
the U.S. telecom sector still faces a potential restructuring
that will involve one or more mergers between Bell companies and
large interexchange carriers, Mr. Governali said.  He once
thought such mergers might begin next year but now thinks merger
mania won't resume until 2003.  "I don't think this will happen
as quickly as we hoped." -- Tom Leithauser, tleithauser@tr.com

NTELOS MULLS OPTIONS AFTER RIVAL SUITOR
MAKES SUPERIOR OFFER FOR CONESTOGA

NTELOS, Inc., hasn't indicated whether it will sweeten its offer
for Conestoga Enterprises, Inc., or let a rival suitor merge with
Conestoga.  The NTELOS/Conestoga agreement was disrupted last
week by D&E Communications, Inc., and NTELOS has until late next
week to make a counterbid and win back the support of Conestoga's
board.

NTELOS, a competitive local exchange carrier and wireless service
provider based in Waynesboro, Va., agreed last July to pay $408
million in cash, stock and assumed debt for Conestoga, a rural
incumbent local exchange carrier based in Birdsboro, Pa.
(TRDaily, July 25).  But last month D&E made an unsolicited bid
that the Conestoga board decided was superior.  The companies
unveiled a merger agreement last Wednesday.

D&E is offering $33 in cash and stock for each Conestoga share. 
The NTELOS bid originally was worth $40 per share, but recent
declines in NTELOS's stock have devalued the agreement to less
than $30 per Conestoga share.  If Conestoga breaks the merger
agreement, NTELOS will receive a $10 million breakup fee. -- Tom
Leithauser, tleithauser@tr.com

COM DEV TO DIVEST WIRELESS UNIT, REPORTS LOSS -- 
COM DEV International Ltd., based in Cambridge, Ontario, an-
nounced on Friday that it would divest its wireless division and
instead concentrate on its space hardware business.  The company
gave few details on the planned divestment but said it expected
to complete the move by early next year.  As a result, COM DEV
took a $36.1 million write-down for its fiscal year ended Oct. 31
and will account for the wireless division as discontinued
operations.  Its decision to sell the assets leaves COM DEV in
violation of financial covenants under its bank credit facility. 
It has received a waiver from the banks through year-end.  For
the full year ended Oct. 31 and excluding the wireless division
operations, COM DEV posted revenue of $76.9 million, up from
$62.9 million in the prior year.  The net loss excluding charges
was $64.9 million compared with a net loss of $2.6 million in the
prior year. 

COUNSEL CORP. 3rd QTR REVS UP, TO $36.5M -- 
Counsel Corp., an Internet telephony provider headquartered in
Toronto, said third quarter revenues grew to $36.5 million from
$9.0 million in the year-ago quarter.  After taking $16 million
in goodwill and other charges, Counsel posted a net loss of $17.2
million in the most recent quarter compared with a profit of
$27.1 million in the comparable quarter last year.  Counsel's
year-over-year revenue improvement reflects the March 2001
acquisition of a controlling interest in I-Link, Inc., and other
assets.  "Counsel was able to acquire communications assets at a
significant discount to replacement cost because of the addition-
al effort and capital required to make them profitable," comment-
ed Allan Silber, chief executive officer.  "We are well on our
way to achieving this objective," he said. 

GLENTEL 3rd QTR REVENUES UP, TO $8.2M -- 
Glentel, Inc., a British Columbia-based wireless service provid-
er, posted third quarter revenue of $8.2 million versus $7.3
million in the comparable quarter last year.  The firm also
reported bottom-line improvement; the net loss was $147,500 for
the most recent quarter compared with a net loss of $937,000 last
year.

TRW GETS $1.3B MILITARY CONTRACT -- 
TRW, Inc., says it has won a $1.3 billion contract to provide the
"communications payload" for the Defense Department's Advanced
Extremely High Frequency system.  That system is the military's
next generation of highly secure communications satellites and
ground systems, TRW said.

KOREA THRUNET CONFIRMS MERGER TALKS -- 
Korea Thrunet, Korea's largest cable modem service provider,
confirmed that it has had "general discussions" regarding a
possible merger with Hanaro Telecom.  Those talks, the company
said, have been "based on the mutual understanding that consoli-
dation in the Korean broadband Internet market would be benefi-
cial for the entire market in the long run."  Korea Thrunet said,
however, that no detailed merger talks were in the works.

NORTEL SEES ASSET SALE CLOSING THIS WEEK -- 
Nortel Networks Corp. said it was planning a Nov. 28 closing date
for the sale of its Clarify assets to Amdocs Ltd. following
receipt of regulatory approvals.  The sale price is approximately
$200 million.

TELECOMS GAIN ON TECH STRENGTH;
TRDaily TELECOM INDEX UP 1.9%

A basket of big telecom stocks blew past modest gains posted by
most broader equities market averages on Monday, fueled by
renewed investor confidence in tech stocks with telecom exposure.
The TRDaily Telecom Index of 90 larger cap telecom service
provider and equipment supplier stocks tacked on 21.5 points, or
1.95%, to close at 1,127. 

By contrast, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 23 points, or
0.23%, to close at 9,982.  The S&P 500 average went up 7 points,
or 0.6%, to finish at 1,157.  The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite
average powered ahead 38 points, or 2.0%, to end the day at
1,941.

Market sentiment on Monday took an early hit on a pronouncement
from the National Bureau of Economic Research that the U.S.
economy officially entered a recession last March.  But by the
end of the day, the focus shifted to the same group's estimate
that an economic recovery could be underway by next summer.

In the telecom arena, tech-related telecom stocks ruled the day. 
Prominent among price gainers were ONI Systems, which gained
$1.38 per share to close at $10.11.  Broadcom Corp. added $3.54
per share to finish at $49.99, while Amdocs tacked on $2.35 per
share for a final price of $34.75.  Selected service providers
also fared well, with Broadwing up $1.19 per share to $10.76 and
Sprint PCS gaining $1.60 per share to end the day at $27.00. 

Individual stock price losses in the sector were fairly mild. 
Lucent Technologies tailed off $0.35 to $8.04 per share after
downgrades on the stock were issued by Morgan Stanley and ABN
AMRO.  Telephone & Data Systems fell $0.50 per share to $91.50 on
news that the firm planned to sell $250 million of bonds. -- John

LORAL UNIT LAUNCHES DEBT EXCHANGE OFFER
AFTER MARKET WARMS TO RECENT BUYBACKS

Loral CyberStar, Inc., a unit of Loral Space & Communications
Ltd., today kicked off an offer to swap $927 million of poorly-
rated junk bonds for $675 million of new bonds backed by the
financial muscle of its parent company.  If the recent success of
similar buyback offers by other telecom sector players is any
guide, today's bid ought to receive a warm reception from the
still-struggling junk bond market.

The offer calls for Loral CyberStar to trade $675 million of new
10% senior notes due 2006 for $927 million of outstanding bonds
bearing interest rates ranging from 11.25% to 12.5% and maturing
in 2007.  Bondholders who tender in the exchange offer would also
get warrants to purchase 6.7 million shares of Loral Space common
stock, representing less than a 2% equity stake in the parent
company.

In exchange for taking a 27% haircut on the principal amount of
the bonds, holders of the new debt will be able to rely on the
financial backing of Loral Space.  The Loral CyberStar bonds now
outstanding are non-recourse to the parent company.  For its
part, the combined Loral enterprise will be able to cut $252
million from its roughly $3.2 billion of long-term debt outstand-
ing at Sept. 30 and save $43 million in annual cash interest
payments.  Bondholders who don't tender in the exchange offer can
keep their bonds but will lose the covenant protections that now
cover the securities.

According to bond market sources, the Loral CyberStar senior
notes covered under the exchange offer are now bid at about 50
cents on the dollar in the market and carry a "Ca" rating from
Moody's Investors Service.  Loral says holders of more than half
of the bonds have agreed to accept the offer.  The bid is condi-
tioned upon 85% of bonds being tendered.

Large-scale buyback offers for distressed-priced junk bonds have
met with a high degree of success in recent weeks.  Earlier this
month, Liberty Media closed on the repurchase of $1.5 billion
face amount of United Pan-Europe Communications NV bonds at
prices ranging from 6 cents to 19 cents on the dollar.  Likewise,
Level 3 Communications, Inc., last month picked up $1.7 billion
face amount of its outstanding bonds at between 15 cents and 48
cents on the dollar. -- John Curran, jcurran@tr.com

TDS PLANS $250M NOTE OFFERING -- 
Telephone & Data Systems, Inc., plans to sell $250 million of
unsecured notes maturing in 2041 under a $1 billion shelf offer-
ing filed last month with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Proceeds are slated to repay short-term debt and for other
corporate purposes. 

VIMPEL PLANS BOND SALE NEXT YEAR -- 
Russian telecom service provider Vimpel-Communications said it
would sell bonds in international markets during the first half
of 2002, subject to market and other conditions.  The firm did
not say how it would use the proceeds from any such sale or
provide other specifics of the transaction.

INFOWAVE SYSTEMS RAISES $13.1M -- 
Infowave Systems, a maker of wireless access software based in
Vancouver, British Columbia, closed on a private sale of common
stock purchase warrants for total proceeds of $13.1 million.
