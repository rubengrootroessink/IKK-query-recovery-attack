Hi Ginger,

I have been working on what I can do for you if you have to cancel your
meeting in December. If you have to cancel, I will have to bill you for 100%
of the amount due. Once payment is received, I will credit 50% of that
revenue to a deposit for a future program to be held within the first
quarter of 2002. The revenue credit must be used by 03/31/2002 or it will be
lost.

I will call you later this morning to discuss.

Thanks,

Coleman
