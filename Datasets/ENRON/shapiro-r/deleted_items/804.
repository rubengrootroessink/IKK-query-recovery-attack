Dear RICK SHAPIRO: 

The tax rebate check you received recently was just the beginning. To get the additional tax savings you're entitled to under the new tax laws, this is one year you're going to want the most authoritative guidance you can get.

That's why you need TurboTax Deluxe.
Completely updated to help you optimize
tax savings under the new tax laws.

TurboTax Deluxe for Tax Year 2001 is designed to help you maximize tax savings under the new tax law changes - and streamline tax preparation. Recently, we mailed you a special announcement about all the tax-saving features included in this year's TurboTax Deluxe.
