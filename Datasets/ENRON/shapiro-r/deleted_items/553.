Tonight at 7pm, Jim McGreevey will show, once again, why is he the right 
change for New Jersey.

Be sure to tune into WABC-New York (Channel 7) or WPVI-Philadelphia (Channel 
6) to catch Jim going head to head with Bret Schundler in the fourth of five 
live gubernatorial debates.

In the previous three debates, Jim has confidently laid out his plans to 
fight for New Jersey's middle and working class, while Bret's words only 
served to re-enforce his out-of-touch, extremist views.

Time and time again, when confronted with the fact that his platform is 
simply not resonating with the voters of New Jersey, Bret Schundler has 
resorted to petty name-calling.  And, by all means, this is not a new 
phenomenon.

In fact, during the Republican primary, Schundler succeeded in alienating a 
large bloc of moderate Republicans by referring to Acting Governor 
DiFrancesco as a "moron" and Congressman Franks as a "liar."

As more and more voters agree with Jim McGreevey's positions on education, 
auto insurance, property taxes and the environment, the Schundler Campaign 
has gotten more and more desperate.

These next four years are going to be for the hard working people and 
families of New Jersey who deserve a government - and a governor - who works 
for them.

So, tune in tonight at 7pm to watch our next Governor, Jim McGreevey, show 
everyone why he is the right change for New Jersey.
