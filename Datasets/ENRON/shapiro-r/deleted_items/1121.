I wish I could be the bearer of good news about the opportunities here in the future, but as the saga unfolds, the picture is less optimistic. I can't offer any encouragement about Houston opportunities  as much as I'd like to. You're a good man ...you will do well, I'm certain. Anything I can do to help I will..I'd be happy to serve as a reference, for example. Hang in there and keep me apprised of developments.

Rick:

Its been a long time and things are coming to their logical end. I thought I would briefly update you on developments here. We are all eagerly awaiting the 19th of November when in all likelihood we would be serving the Termination  Notice (TN) to the state government. Thereafter the assets would be transfered to the State Utility and we would want to proceed to London for international arbitration. There may be a few hurdles in the sense that we already have some cases lined against us in various Indian courts. Its not clear if we can proceed as smoothly as the way I have described in the initial lines.

We had an all employee meeting , a few days back, and Wade informed us of the recent developments. Post that he did indicate in no uncertain terms the future of all the employees here. Give and take I expect that our services here would be required at max till the time the TN is served, post that our contracts could be severed. Some relocations and some severances have already started and its a matter of time before my turn arrives.

I would like to explore possible future employment opportunities under you, in Houston. It would give me immense pleasure if I could in any way continue to contribute to the activities of the division. 

Any advice from you would boost my morale

Warm Regards
Ban
