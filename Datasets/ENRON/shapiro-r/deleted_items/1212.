Hi Stuart nice hearing from you. Life here has been tough from day 1, as I was involved with the USS Cole! Would be nice to stay in touch. I'm leaving the State Dept 15 Dec and returning to Navy active duty in Pensacola FL. I've been in contact with your mom and it sounds as if she is having an impossible time dealing with life and like you dad is in rough shape. Would love to have emails too for Ricky and Michael. We have a small family and would be a shame to let it remain to be so scattered. Would love to hear what you are up to. Best regards, Jesse

Jesse:   Mom forwarded your photo.   You are looking good.   How are you doing?  How has Yemen been since Sept. 11?   
Take care, Stuart
