Hello! Rick,

Yesterday, we received a call from the AMEE ( Mexican Association of Electric Power), where Ricardo is the Vice-president of de-regulation and open access, regarding to the six-month?s payment to the AMEE. This payment is for $900 dollars or $9000 pesos.   I just wanted to ask you if we should continue or not our relationship with the AMEE. Last Friday we were invited by the AMME to a working breakfast with Senator Genaro Borrego, where he explained to us his proposal related to the energy sector reform.  

Below you will find a brief description of the AMEE.
The AMEE was created on February of 1999, after President Ernesto Zedillo sent an initiative to Congress for the restructuring of the Electric Industry. From that moment the intention of the AMEE has been to actively participate in the discussions and of course in the opening of the electric market for the private investment. 

This association allows the participation of all of the members of the industry that have interest in promoting the AMEE?s ideas and are willing to contribute with their ideas to the opening of the energy industry. The AMEE is an organism that has had access to privilege information for its analyses from the government authorities and the Congress. In fact, the AMEE is negotiating the best conditions for the opening and de-regulation of the market with them. The AMEE has work teams with the CFE, the CRE (regulatory entity), Pemex, the Secretariat of Energy and with the National Commission for energy savings.

The AMEE has organized working breakfasts with members of the Congress, and co-organizing events like the Power-Mex 2001, co-generation seminars and specialized conferences related to the energy area, etc.

Regards,

Kikumi
