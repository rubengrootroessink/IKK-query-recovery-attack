We have never met, but I currently head up Government Affairs on a global basis for Enron, whose news I'm sure each of you have heard about in recent days. Naturally, I am reassessing the future and believe my deep understanding of the energy industry and the governmental/regulatory landscape that surrounds that industry could be quite helpful to UBS Warburg in being better able to serve your clients by better understanding the energy equities. I know this is a stretch, but talk to me, meet me...I know I can convince you of my value. I can be reached at 713-853-3407 in addition to e-mail. Thanks for your time and consideration.

Thanks again for taking the time to meet with me today. I enjoyed our visit and remain very interested in the opportunity at El Paso. I believe I can make a difference and build a merchant regulatory function that will add value and be respected in the industry. Feel free to call Steve Kean at 713-853-1586. I'd also be happy to give you some additional names. Thanks again.

Rick:
It's hard to articulate, so I'll just say that you're doing a phenomenal job.  Whatever happens, you have an incredible amount to proud of, not the least of which is how you've handled things during these very tough times.  Please remember that there's alot of folks out there that appreciate what you're doing and care about you alot.  And then there's your family, which is the most important thing.  Thanks again for your efforts.  Talk to you soon.  Keep hanging in there.

Best,
Jeff
