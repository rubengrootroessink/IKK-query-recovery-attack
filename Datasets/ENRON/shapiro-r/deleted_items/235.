 Dear Mr. Shapiro:

            I am a Master's student at Texas A&M University.  I met with Paula Rieker of Investor Relations at Enron last Wednesday during the presentation she gave in the College of Business at Texas A&M.  I have been interested in Enron for some time, and Ms. Rieker's presentation impressed me even further.  

I spoke with Ms. Rieker after her presentation about my interest in working in the Government Relations Department at Enron.  She was kind enough to provide me with your name and phone number as a contact person.  I have a Bachelor's degree in Government from The University of Texas at Austin.  I feel that the combination of my undergraduate government degree and the graduate degree in marketing that I am currently pursuing, makes government relations an ideal area for me.  I am interested in a summer internship beginning in June 2002, which could possibly lead to full-time employment upon completion of my graduate degree in December 2002.  I am attaching m! y resume for your review.   

Thank you for your time, Mr. Shapiro.  I look forward to hearing from you concerning my interest in working at Enron.

 

                                                                                    Sincerely,

                                                                                    Whitney Bessler
