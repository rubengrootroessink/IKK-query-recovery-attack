For what is worth I just wanted to let you guys know that my thoughts and
prayers are with you.  I know that times are pretty tough right now, but you
guys are some of the brightest and most intelligent that I have had the
pleasure of working with and knowing.  I am sure that you will get through
this and the company will, as always, be indebted to you.  Take care and if
there is anything that I can do to help, please feel free to let me know.
