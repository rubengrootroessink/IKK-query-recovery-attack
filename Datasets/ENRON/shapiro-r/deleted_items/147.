Any flexibility to move it up to November 1?   If there's no flexibility, that's fine.

Are you kidding?.......if not. I would suggest November 12, the day we are likely to use on a uniform basis.

Rick:  I forgot to ask you about my last day when we talked this morning.  I was hoping that it could be next Friday?   Is that possible?

Thanks,
