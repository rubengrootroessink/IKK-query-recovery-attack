Elizabeth .  This response will be too late for your needs. I am assuming that the scope of the survey is to look at information technology tools that would enhance our effectiveness. If so, there are some tools that we used in South America and I do not know if we have an equivalent here.

a) Itinerary Lotus Notes data base. -  Very convenient. It lists every one with the contact information and the latest itinerary. It allows people on the road to make last minute changes.  

b) Project document data base.-  This is in the Lotus Notes data base environment. It is a convenient place to find all related documents associated with a given project. (i.e. development of a power plant , or   a regulatory filing). Access is granted to those that need access to the "project documents"

c) Project task status.- My personal favorite.- It allows people cooperating on a project to communicate and keep track on related activities. Good tool for weekly to-do-list.  Access is given to those that are working on the project. Lotus Notes environment.  Example - NERC related tasks.

Ginger - Please forward to Gov't Affairs group.  Thanks!

We're trying to identify information needs - both specific and general.  Many of these are already provided, and response to this survey will help in identifying new services and prioritizing/improving existing offerings.  Depending on the response to each offering, most will likely be made available.  For this effort, please rank up to five choices in the list below (1=highest).  We'll tally the results, identify which items will have priority and communicate back how those needs will direct implementation efforts.  Please note that items marked with (*) would require your input.  Please click on Forward for this message to allow you to type in your ranking numbers, and send the response to Rita Hartfield by Wednesday, October 17.

Thanks!
Elizabeth
