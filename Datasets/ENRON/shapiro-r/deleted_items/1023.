  As  the  timing to process filings that are necessary  to obtain regulatory    approvals for our merger with Dynegy approaches, 
 many of you have received, or will receive in the next few days, requests for information that is necessary for  these  regulatory filings . Rick Shapiro is coordinating this effort for Enron and is working very closely with his counterparts at Dynegy  We recognize that each of you are facing many demands at this time ,    but  providing this information in the most accurate and expeditious manner possible is of the highest priority.  Y our cooperation  is very much appreciated.
