FYI - this is the briefing that has now been shared with the team.  In accordance with HR advice, they are also aware that the likely reduction is also in the order of 50 per cent.  Note the time line, clearly we need to close down the remaining uncertainties in the near future.

Greg should also be sending you the budget numbers which I'm due to discuss with Michael on Thursday evening.  I'm also available for the meeting Maureen is arranging with Kean, Brown, Sherriff and us for Friday.

Regards,

Paul

All,

I have meetings scheduled with most of you for Monday, and for those of you I don't I would really appreciate getting 1/2 hour to go through next steps with following the Voluntary Redundancy Programme. Rachel will call you.

Please find attached the following information I need to talk you through:


Bu Briefing Document. ( Clearly we need to make sure we are consistent across the Organisation )

 

Q&A Crib Sheet.

 
Draft Timeline.

 

Selection Criteria.  As you know it is imperative from a legal perspective that we document fully our selection criteria for both voluntary and if necessary, compulsory redundancy and our assessment of employees against those criteria . This information will be vital if we have to defend a claim on the basis of the fairness of our selection process.   

 

Finally for those who have remote offices, we need to decide a plan of action / timelines / legal implications etc.  Please note, these documents are still subject to final approval so I will bring any amendments when I see you.

Monday is going to be hectic, so if you need me call my mobile on 07818 077104.

Regards

Sophie
