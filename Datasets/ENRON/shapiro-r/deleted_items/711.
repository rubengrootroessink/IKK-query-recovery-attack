NEW JERSEY DEMOCRATS WIN SUPPORT OF MILLION MOM MARCH:
NJ CHAPTER OF GUN SAFETY GROUP ENDORSES
80 DEMOCRATIC LEGISLATIVE CANDIDATES

The New Jersey Chapter of the Million Mom March, a grassroots organization 
that promotes gun safety, announced its endorsement of 80 Democratic 
legislative candidates running in this year's election.

Democrats know that key ways to increase public safety are to ensure the 
vigorous enforcement of New Jersey's existing gun laws and keep firearms out 
of the hands of criminals. Democrats also oppose any law that would legalize 
the carrying of a concealed weapon, support the manufacturing of child-proof 
handguns and will preserve the assault-weapons ban to keep weapons off New 
Jersey's streets.

"This year, the Republican ticket has stated it would sign laws making it 
legal to carry concealed weapons and has expressed opposition to the 
licensing and registration of handguns," stated Assembly Democratic Leader, 
Joe Doria, (D-Hudson).  "It's no wonder that, out of 100 endorsees, 80 of 
them were Democrats.  The Democratic Party has been, and will continue to 
be, a strong supporter of laws that will keep dangerous weapons out of our 
communities."

The selection process was based on incumbents' voting records and 
candidates' answers to a survey asking their positions on three issues: 
maintaining current laws regarding the carrying of concealed weapons, 
supporting childproof handgun legislation currently pending in the 
Legislature and maintaining New Jersey's Assault Weapons Ban passed in 1990.

Senate Democratic leader, Dick Codey (D-Essex), is a prime sponsor of the 
"Childproof Handgun Bill" which would require the sale of personalized 
handguns, also known as childproof handguns. However, due to Republican 
infighting, the Speaker of the Assembly has refused to post this legislation 
for a vote.

"As a prime sponsor of the Childproof Handgun Bill, I realize that the only 
way we can get this important legislation signed into law is to have 
Democratic majorities in the Senate and Assembly," stated Senator Codey. 
"Rather than doing what is right for the people of New Jersey, Republicans 
are holding this bill hostage because of internal politics. That isn't real 
leadership.  It's time for a change."
