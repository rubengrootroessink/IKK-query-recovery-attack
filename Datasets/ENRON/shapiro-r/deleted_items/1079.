Buckle up and hold tight.  Like I said before, you've got an immense amount=
 of support and respect from your group, irrespective of the outcome.  Man,=
 who ever woulda thunk...

FYI:  Calger came down from Portland to talk to the troops--he was pretty d=
arn tough on his criticism of old management (the one's who have left) and =
said the new team is pushing hard to clean things up and right the ship---h=
e did a pretty good job.  Guess the question remains, Is the mess too big t=
o clean up?

Also, touch based with Jim when you get a minute re: meeting today with Edi=
son to try to get our money back.  Edison is being an absolute *$#-hole.  T=
heir bottom line, if you can believe it, is that WE OWE THEM money.  The ar=
rogance is astounding. We're contemplating as an option recommending to you=
 and management that we join with others and threaten to take Edison in inv=
oluntarily---just contemplating at this point, though. ??If you have any qu=
estions, just let me know.  But essentially, the meeting followed along the=
 outlines of the note I sent out a couple of days ago outlining Edison's po=
sition (which I'm re-attaching).??Best,?Jeff?? -----Original Message-----?F=

 talking about charging us (through a reduced PX credit) for our "share" of=
 the undercollection.?Our "share" would be paid down through a reduction in=
 the PX credit over the life of the settlement (presumably about 2-3 years)=
.?In short, with one hand Edison would pay us what they owe us; with the ot=

base the amount of the undercollection owed by DA customers on the percenta=

 pay for 10% of the undercollection).?We had a very "animated" discussion t=

gross misunderstanding since his proposal simply doesn't track.?Fielder sai=
d that they believe their argument is solid.?Here's how we left it--he's go=
