I'm not sure there's a lot we can offer, but maybe we can talk about this when you get back in town?

Sue,

As you no doubt are aware, my days in EBS-A/P are very likely coming to an end very soon, along with most of the rest of us in Asia.  I wrote Mona, hoping to get some help finding a job, perhaps back in Houston or elsewhere in Asia, but her prognosis was not good.

I am a  distinct disadvantage here, as I am so new to Enron.  you are one of the few that knows who I am and what my capabilities and qualifications are.

Please do what you can to help me find a new position in Enron.  Here is my updated CV and a companion paper.

Thanks,
