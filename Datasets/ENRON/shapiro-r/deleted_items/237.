Richard,

Agree completely.  Actually I thought we might want to take the opportunity to put Paul on an Exec agreement.  He currently only has 3 months notice!  I am in the middle of getting some market data so will send something accross.

I had a very productive meeting with Paul D yesterday and we agreed some next steps - I have not yet met with Paul H but will update you as soon as I have.

Regards

Sophie

One thing I didn't mention was that Michael Brown  and I agreed a base compensation increase for Paul Dawson was in order...we didn't agree on a number..so you might want to follow up with Michael. Thanks.
