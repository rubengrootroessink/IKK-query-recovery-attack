.. somewhat dependent on who leaves and what gaps are created, but some suggestions -

RTO/wholesale market development, although that area already seems crowded. 
transmission rate issues, either from policy perspective (develop in-house talent to displace some of the $500/hr vultures we use) or for specific risk mgmt. needs that are coming up (e.g., Com Ed transmission rate case at FERC and other similar cases we can expect in the future))
specific rate proceedings that need attention (NY unbundling, or types of cases that I've poked around with recently - Georgia Power, Gulf Power, Com Ed  - as they come up)
regional support - like Texas retail regulatory issues in support of Jean, if Pat ends up focusing more on other Western states.

I think he could work into any of these areas.

An aside - Alberto and I talked to Frederico Haesler at San Juan gas today and he did say they have made some positive changes in the last year - eliminating some rate classifications and minimizing some rate discounting, which were things recommended before.  He also committed to provide new information to us that would help us help them.  So this is good, although I still would not have us throw a whole lot of time into this.

Thoughts as to nature of defined role?

One thing you said yesterday lingered with me, about Alberto ...
I think his skills should put him on the roster somewhere (ahead of some others mentioned on Monday, including some in my own group that I defended), so I'm lobbying on his behalf.  But on the other hand, I think it makes sense to bring him into a well defined role ...
So my lobbying is for the sake of getting him in the Govt Affairs group, well placed.
