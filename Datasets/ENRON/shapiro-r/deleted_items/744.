Hey there Rick.  Have you spoken to Jo Ann Hill yet in regards to the length of my stay?  Am I staying until the end of the year or the end of the week?  I'm working on a few things and I'm trying to make sure they are complete before I leave.  This helps me better with the  way I schedule my activities.

Thanks,

Melinda
