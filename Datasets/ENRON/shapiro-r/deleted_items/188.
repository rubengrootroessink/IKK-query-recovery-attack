We filed the attached protest in the ITC proceeding requesting approval of its termination with ARTO and joining MISO.  The ITC-MISO Agreement would allow ITC to retain a separate "alternative" OATT from the MISO OATT, giving ITC the authority to propose new transmission products and services for its International zone.  We protested asking the Commission to first take up EPMI's request to order with specific guidance a single Midwest RTO.  We further argued that multiple transmission tariffs in the Midwest would balkanize the market and allow continuation of discriminatory practices.
