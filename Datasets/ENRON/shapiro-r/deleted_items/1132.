What do you think about something like this in response to the layoff question?  It could become our new "standard corporate policy."

Karen -- 

Here's the safest statement I know for our situation as it relates to employment:

"We do not speculate about future employment levels.  If and when we have ever have changes affecting employees, we tell them first."

(Of course, we'll need to pretend that we didn't break the Europe layoff on Dow Jones!)
