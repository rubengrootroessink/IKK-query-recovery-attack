Read below- I couldn't agree more and from a fellow liberal Democrat(a grou=
p never exactly known for flag-waving) America is indeed the world's best h=
ope in so many ways, including the fight against the evil  we face today.

Americans Blaming America

The traumatic events of September 11 provided something of a=20
moral Rorschach Test for Americans.  The vast majority of our=20
people -- and indeed, the vast majority of people around the=20
world -- immediately and instinctively saw the terrorist attacks=20
as an unmitigated act of evil, whatever their views on American=20
policies at home or abroad. =20

But on the political fringes of our country, there were some who=20
just as instinctively reached for explanations in which Americans,=20
in the end, were at least partly responsible for our own tragic=20
misfortune. =20

In the current issue of The Nation, Robert Fisk deplores the=20
terrorist attacks, but then all but equates them to a variety of U.S.=20
and Israeli actions: "the sanctions that have destroyed the lives=20
of perhaps half a million children in Iraq," the "17,500 civilians=20
killed in Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon," etc., etc.  No, says=20
Fisk, you can't blame anyone else for the September 11 attacks,=20
but "the malign influence of history and our share in its burden=20
must surely stand in the dark with the suicide bombers."  This=20
slippery line of reasoning is, of course, being echoed on television=20
each night by a variety of "Middle East experts" who begin by=20
deploring the terrorists, but who eventually get around to blaming=20
America for not forcing Israel to cave into Palestinian demands,=20
thus "angering" public opinion in Arab and other Islamic countries. =20

On the Right, there was a breathtaking example of "blame=20
America" opinion from none other than the Reverends Jerry=20
Falwell and Pat Robertson, on the latter's Christian Broadcasting=20
Network.  Quoth Falwell: "I really believe that the pagans and the=20
abortionists and the feminists and the gays and the lesbians who=20
are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle, the ACLU=20
and the People for the American Way -- all of them who have=20
tried to secularize America -- I point the finger in their face and=20
say, 'You helped this happen.'=05  God continues to lift the curtain=20
and allow the enemies of America to give us probably what we=20
deserve."  Robertson quickly replied, "Jerry, that's my feeling." =20
Perhaps the dozens of conservative politicians and commentators=20
who last year vilified Senator John McCain for calling Falwell and=20
Robertson "extremists" owe the Arizona Senator an apology. =20

These sporadic expressions of "blame America" sentiment have=20
been relatively rare.  But they are eerily congruent with the rhetoric=20
of terrorists aflame at the alleged arrogance or wickedness of=20
America.  Those on the Left who demonize our Middle East=20
policies or our support for economic globalization, and those on=20
the Right who are convinced that our culture is fatally decadent,=20
should prayerfully reflect on this congruence.  Perhaps then they=20
can begin to share the moral clarity of most of their fellow-citizens. =20
America is hardly perfect, but in this fight against terrorism, it's=20
the best hope for good in the face of evil.=20
