Late last week, the NYISO distributed a set of General Principles for Installed Capacity (ICAP) and draft Regional ICAP Validation Procedures that were developed by staff's of the three northeast ISOs. (I have already  circulated these within Enron for review, but don't see serious problems with them, given that the principles simply attempt to harmonize the treatment of ICAP transactions between the three ISOs.) The NYISO has contacted me, as Chairman of the ICAP working group, and requested to include the attached quote from me in a press release they plan to issue announcing the release of the draft principles. I have no problem with the quote, but wanted to know whether we have any sensitivity to being part of any press releases at this time, either because of  our current situation, or because we continue to oppose ICAP? I'd appreciate it if you could get back to me today so that I can let the NYISO know where we stand. Thanks. Howard

Howard,

Can you stand behind this statement?....I tried to keep it as innocent as
possible yet to get the point across that the NYISO collaborative process
really works for all Market Participants.
