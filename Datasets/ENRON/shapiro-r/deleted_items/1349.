Rick:  I don't even know if I can say goodbye to you.  I know you're not supposed to admit these kinds of things, but I'm not sure I can say goodbye without getting emotional.  I truly care about you, and I will watch your back wherever I am.

Rick, et al:

Thank you so much for such a special evening.  I really enjoyed dinner, and the rare occasion to catch up with all of you.  It meant a lot to me that you were willing to give up an evening with your family to wish me well.  

It has truly been a privilege to work with such talented colleagues (as Amr would say).  I will miss working with you, and I will miss your friendship.  

Thanks again.

Lisa

Gentlemen. I am writing to let you know that I have recently been appointed
as president and COO of all of GPC's operations ouside of Canada and the US.
So please let me know if I can help in any foreign markets at all. You will
recall my/GPC's work for Enron on Project Stanley here in Canada.

On another matter, If in anyway we can help you on the current situation
regarding market confidence let me know. I would be more than willing to put
together of our  best people in GPC Fleishman Hillard or Omnicom to come
down and brain storm about media relations, investor communications or
anything else.

Good luck.

Hi Rick,

I'm responding to your very nice voicemail message in writing because I seem to have less control over my emotions these days than I would like.  I cannot tell you how much I appreciate everything you have done for me.  I continue to hold you in the very highest regard professionally and as a friend.  I can honestly say that I have no regrets over the decisions that I have made.  Working with you (and for Enron) has given me opportunities to expand professionally and personally that I never would have had otherwise.  Also, the move to Texas has opened new horizons for my family and taught us that we can be happy in settings very different from what we had known before.

Like you, I wish with all my heart that things had worked out differently.  It would be wonderful to continue to work with you--here or elsewhere.  Whatever comes, I'm greatful for all of the good things that have come my way so far.  Thanks again for everything.  You are an amazing person and an amazing friend.

Sue
