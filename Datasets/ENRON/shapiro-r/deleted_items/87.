Rick--I forgot to thank you for the great job you did in briefing the Calvert people last week.  They want to hear our honest comments about the issue and not fluff.  I could tell they were fascinated, particularly the energy policy analyst who had raised the issue.

I appreciate your doing this on short notice and it was a big help.  Kelly.
