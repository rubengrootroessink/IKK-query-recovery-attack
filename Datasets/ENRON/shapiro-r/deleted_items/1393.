Lee Sachs was contacted for a second interview by Girth.  Lee concluded fro=
m this interview that Girth is going down the "Enron influence" path.  Girt=
h did not probe the question of whether derivatives drive the physical comm=
odity market, which as noted below was a big part of the first interview.  =
Girth asked Lee extensive questions about Enron's involvement in the legisl=
ation and who talked to whom and when.  Girth said that he had talked to th=
e CFTC who said they got steamrolled on the energy exemption by the Hill.  =
Lee reminded Girth how the CFTC got themselves into this bind when they fir=
st issued the "Concept Release" paper, which the President's working group =
immediately denounced.  Lee said that the Working Group constantly told the=
 CFTC that they should work out the issue with the Hill and to do so quickl=
y because the CFTC had made a massive mistake with the Concept Release docu=
ment.  Lee reminded Girth that while the Working group did not get into the=
 specifics of the energy exemption, that in fact energy was already exempte=
d prior to reauthorization and that it continued to meet the criteria laid =
out in the President's report.  I can go into that part of the discussion m=
ore thoroughly, but just suffice it to say Lee meticulously walked Girth th=
rough the safe harbor test and the background of the issue.  Girth asked Le=
e if I had talked to Lee about the issue after leaving Treasury, to which L=
ee said we talked but not about this subject and that he instead talked to =
Chris Long.  Girth asked if Ken Lay had talked to either Summers or Phil Gr=
amm.  Lee said he did not think Ken talked to Summers about the CFTC reauth=
orization (but mentioned Ken's very constructive engagement on the Calif en=
ergy talks) and that as far as Ken talking to Gramm, Lee had no idea but as=
sumed two Republican Texans would have lots of reasons to talk to each othe=
r.  Girth told Lee he would soon go on vacation and that they story would c=
ome after Labor Day. =20

As I mentioned earlier to Mark, Jeff Girth of the NYT again today contacted=
 Lee Sachs about Enron.  You recall Lee was Asst Secretary of Treasury for =
Financial Markets during the Clinton Administration.  From his conversation=
, Lee reports the following items were raised by Girth:  a) the state of en=
ergy trading products and investment climate; b)  Enron's role in this mark=
et; c) whether and how financial energy products drive pricing and supply o=
f physical energy products (Lee told him emphatically no); and, c) whether =
government regulators understand these issues.  Lee said this is clearly an=
 Enron specific story.  Lee thinks Girth came away from the conversation wi=
th more of a right perspective (namely that these are important markets and=
 that we play a vital role).  Lee said that Girth was less focussed on pass=
age of the CEA and the politics than Girth had been in an earlier conversat=
ion; almost all  of today's conversation was forward looking.  Girth told L=
ee that he had not told Lee "all" that is behind this story, but did say th=
at there is an interesting twist (Lee thinks Girth perhaps something specif=
ic either on a document front or source).   Lee gave Girth a list of expert=
s to talk to who are unbiased but clearly right thinking on the subject.  L=
ee suggested that Girth to:  Pat Parkinson at the Fed (the godfather of the=
 "hands off" regulatory perspective for the OTC market), Bill Rainer, and E=
d Rosen (a prominent attorney in NY).  Lee expects Girth to keep calling hi=
m.
