Everyone here recently received an email from the Office of the Chairman indicating that reductions in businesses will happen from next week.  Our situation here in Japan is precisely how Nick and I outlined during our floor meeting Monday morning.  This was further confirmed in a conversation I had with Mike McConnell this morning.  As discussed, we are currently looking for outside investors to support Enron's businesses in Japan.  We will keep you abreast of our progress.
 
Joe
