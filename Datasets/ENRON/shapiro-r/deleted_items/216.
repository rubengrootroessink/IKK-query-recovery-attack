This is the presentation we spoke about a month ago. Please take a look if you have chance. Feel free to add, particularly if you see any sensitive issues.

Please note that the presentation is a one way street. It is not a comparison between Brazil and California, but the lessons the former could extract from the latter.

The purpose of the presentation is to create awareness about the benefits of competition, customer response and how bad price controls are

In the very end, I quoted two guys from the Cato institute. If there are any sensisitve issues, I will eliminate the paragraph.

To play safe, I did not put the Enron logo. This gives me the possibility of opening by saying that the ideas are the one of the author. If you do not oppose, I can include the Enron logo.

Tks
