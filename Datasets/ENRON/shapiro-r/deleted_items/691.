U.S. REACHES SETTLEMENT WITH NextWave;
McCain WARNS AGAINST `SHORTCHANGING' TAXPAYERS

A settlement to resolve the dispute over NextWave Telecom, Inc.'s
"C" and "F" block PCS (personal communications service) licenses is
complete, sources told TRDaily today.  Over the weekend, FCC
staffers intend to brief key congressional aides on the accord with
an eye toward having everyone on board for an announcement early
next week, sources said.

But a top senator today raised concerns that a settlement with
NextWave could "shortchange" U.S. taxpayers.  "What troubles me is
that spectrum auction revenues are being lost just when they are
most needed," said Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.), the ranking member
on the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, in
a letter to Senate Majority Leader Thomas A. Daschle (D., S.D.) and
Minority Leader Trent Lott (R., Miss.).

Sen. McCain noted the numerous demands on the U.S. budget due to
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, including funding the war,
rebuilding damaged infrastructure, and propping up weakened
industries.

"Since revenues are essential to each of these vital tasks, I
believe that the government can no longer afford to simply `pay
off' a company whose only contribution to the American economy has
been to manipulate, for private gain, the results of an improperly
designed auction of a valuable public good," Sen. McCain added.

Sen. McCain noted NextWave reportedly would walk away with $5
billion in a settlement, and the U.S. Treasury would get about $11
billion.  By contrast, the government would have received $15.85
billion for NextWave's spectrum if an appeals court hadn't ruled
that the FCC illegally reclaimed the carrier's licenses.  A
reauction earlier this year of NextWave's licenses netted a total
of $16.8 billion, including licenses that didn't belong to
NextWave.

The senator also noted that Verizon Wireless reportedly had asked
to delay until May 2002 paying the balance of what it would owe on
the licenses it bid on at the reauction.

"What assurances will the American taxpayer have that the federal
government will receive the billions owed to them from the January
reauction?" Sen. McCain asked.  "The taxpayers of this country
deserve an agreement that properly ensures that settlement funds
are paid in full before the American taxpayer is asked to
participate in any settlement.

"The expected $17 billion. . .in receipts from January's reauction
would have provided revenue desperately needed to address the
recent terrorist attacks upon this country, and I am disturbed that
an American company would force American taxpayers to forgo some of
that money by exploiting legal technicalities," he added.  "But if
this does happen, then this Congress must use its oversight
authority to ensure that this matter is resolved upon terms that
protect the American people from being shortchanged once again."

Lawmakers' endorsement of any NextWave settlement is crucial;
Congress would be asked to approve legislation that would codify
the accord, sources said.

BUSH ADMINISTRATION SAYS IT OPPOSES
NORTHPOINT'S EFFORTS TO AVOID AUCTIONS

Northpoint Technology, Inc.'s attempt to gain access to Ku-band
spectrum for free has suffered a major setback.  The Bush
administration has weighed in against the company, saying it
opposes any efforts to restrict the FCC's ability to assign
terrestrial licenses by competitive bidding.

The development represents a victory for the direct broadcast
satellite (DBS) and terrestrial wireless industries, which have
fought Northpoint on the issue.

Sources have said that Northpoint was attempting to get senators to
tack a "rider" onto a fiscal year 2002 appropriations bill that
would prohibit the FCC from auctioning spectrum to terrestrial
wireless providers if those frequencies were licensed to satellite
services without such competitive bidding (TR, Oct 22).

The FCC last year said that terrestrial wireless systems can share
the Ku-band with DBS providers and it is now considering technical
and service rules for licensing Northpoint, including whether to
auction the spectrum (TR, Dec. 4, 2000).

In an Oct. 25 statement regarding the Senate agriculture
appropriations bill, the White House's Office of Management and
Budget said the Bush administration "would strongly oppose any
amendment that would restrict the FCC's ability to assign, via
competitive bidding, spectrum licenses that could be used by
terrestrial (i.e., non-satellite) services.

"Such a provision would interfere with the efficient allocation of
federal spectrum licenses, provide a windfall to certain users, and
reduce federal revenues," OMB added.

The Satellite Broadcasting and Communications Association, which
represents DBS providers, praised the Bush administration's
position.  "There is no public policy or legal justification for
Congress to accept Northpoint's outrageous proposal to change
current law and give Northpoint the use of this spectrum for free,"
said Andy Wright, SBCA's acting president.

But Antoinette Cook Bush, Northpoint's executive vice president,
responded, "It is very hypocritical for SBCA to urge auctions for
our company, when its members such as Hughes [Electronics Corp.]
successfully urged Congress to enact legislation last year to
exempt themselves from auctions while their applications were
pending to share spectrum with Northpoint."

She added that Northpoint "only seeks fair and equal treatment with
other companies seeking to use the same spectrum. . .The existing
statutory exemption plainly gives satellites an enormous
competitive advantage over us and we're simply asking the Congress
and the administration to restore a technologically neutral
regulatory process."

COMMISSIONERS:  BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT SUFFERS
FROM UNCERTAINTY, SLOW REGULATORY PROCESSES

FCC Commissioners today disputed that there's a "broadband crisis"
in the U.S.  Broadband deployment is occurring "on a reasonable and
timely basis" compared with the pace of earlier technologies, Com-
missioner Kathleen Q. Abernathy said.

She and Commissioners Michael J. Copps and Kevin J. Martin shared
their ideas for spurring the deployment of advanced services today
at a national broadband summit in Arlington, Va.  Sponsors of the
summit included the National Association of Regulatory Utility
Commissioners and the National Exchange Carrier Association, Inc.

Commissioner Copps called broadband a "precious right" for all
Americans but said it was "too early to say we have a `broadband
divide.'"  Commissioner Martin said the country should focus on
broadband as a "fundamental national priority."

"We need to change the way government taxes broadband services and
[creates] regulatory financial disincentives," he said.  He
specifically singled out state and local government burdens such as
franchise fees, right-of-way fees, and permitting processes.

"We need more strict enforcement of the collocation rules,
additional performance measures [on unbundled network elements],
and the FCC should reconsider which elements should be made
available," he said.  Regulators also need to remove the
"regulatory underbrush" of federal, state, and local rules, he
said.

The FCC should move expeditiously on the cable open access pro-
ceeding and perhaps create a "rocket docket" to resolve complaints
filed with the Enforcement Bureau, he said.  According to one
source, there are thousands of pending Internet service provider
complaints.

Commissioner Abernathy said the FCC should look at what it could do
to encourage investment in telecom facilities.  "We need to look at
the decision and rulemaking processes and address issues sooner,"
she said.  "We are behind the curve on technology advances."

Mr. Copps said the current pessimism regarding broadband deployment
was misguided.  Broadband can revitalize the economy, he said.  But
the FCC "gets in trouble when it doesn't look at the supply-and-de-
mand issues for a service and sets policies to encourage certain
services."  He cited third-generation wireless services and digital
TV as examples where expectations hadn't been met.

"The train can't carry freight until the tracks are laid," he said.=20
The FCC's role is to eliminate barriers, regulate with clarity and
transparency, and speed decision making, he added.

****************************************************************
ERICSSON FOCUSES ON COST-CUTTING
AS MOBILE GEAR MARKET RECEDES

As its customers pause to consider how and when to deploy third-
generation (3G) wireless services, Telefon AB LM Ericsson is
counting on deeper cost-cutting to combat slower sales.  The
"efficiency program," as the cost-reduction effort is known, "is
ahead of schedule," President and Chief Executive Officer Kurt
Hellstrom said today.

The company cut 2.5 billion Swedish kronor ($236 million) in the
quarter that ended Sept. 30 and will save 7 billion kronor ($660.7
million) by year-end, he said.  It reduced headcount by 5,500
employees during the quarter, bringing its headcount cuts to 6,800
so far this year.

The Swedish telecom equipment maker lent more weight to its cost-
cutting prospects by announcing that Michael Treschow would become
chairman, effective March 2002.  He will resign as president and
CEO of Electrolux and will succeed Lars Ramqvist as Ericsson's
chairman.

Mr. Treschow "is known for his effective cost-cutting management
skills at Electrolux and Atlas Copco and we believe he is just what
Ericsson needs in this difficult operating environment," said
Adnaan Ahmad of Merrill Lynch & Co.

Ericsson's third quarter results fell short of expectations.  The
company recorded sales of 54.6 billion kronor ($5.2 billion), a 19%
drop from a year ago.  Net losses totaled 4 billion kronor ($377.5
million) versus a net gain of 4.4 billion kronor ($415.3 million)
a year ago.

The outlook for the rest of this year and 2002 isn't particularly
bright.  The company revised its prediction that sales for the
entire mobile systems industry would remain flat or show modest
growth next year.  It now expects the market to be down as much as
10%.  Its own sales will track that industry trend, it said.

The company's third quarter results were "weaker than
expectations," and its fourth quarter guidance was "disappointing,"
said Jeffrey Schlesinger of UBS Warburg LLC.  Moody's Investors
Service, meanwhile, downgraded the company's long-term debt rating
to "Baa-1" from "A-3."

"There are still no signs of a recovery in the demand for mobile
phone equipment," Moody's said.  "On the contrary, Moody's expects
more carriers to defer upgrades to the GPRS [general packet radio
service] standard, to postpone installations of 3G networks, or to
agree with partners on network sharing."

"The rating downgrade is based on Ericsson's increasing reliance on
wireless infrastructure equipment and on the anticipated further
slowdown and heightened price competition in this segment as
wireless operators are very carefully considering their complicated
technology migration strategies," Moody's said.

JDS UNIPHASE SEES DEMAND FALLING FURTHER,
AFTER FIRST QUARTER SALES DROPPED 45%

JDS Uniphase Corp., a bellwether in the optical networking
equipment sector, late Thursday said it still couldn't see the bot-
tom of the demand slump that sequentially trimmed its revenues by
nearly half in the firm's fiscal first quarter ending Sept. 29.

JDS's revenues in the quarter fell to $329 million, 45% below the
$601 million reported for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 ending
June 30.  During the first quarter of fiscal 2000, JDS racked up
$786 million of revenues.  The latest quarter was accompanied by a=20
$260 million net loss excluding some downsizing and other charges
versus a $177 million profit in the year-ago quarter.

"Our industry continues to be affected by declining carrier capital
spending and a weak overall economic environment," commented Jozef
Straus, co-chairman, president, and chief executive officer.   In
the short term at least, JDS executives expect neither of those
trends to abate.

"The company anticipates sales for the second quarter will be
approximately 10%-15% below the first quarter as the downturn in
the company's markets continues," JDS said in its earnings release
late yesterday.  Excluding charges related to cost-cutting
measures, JDS expects to report a small net loss for the second
quarter.  The firm declined to offer any financial performance
guidance beyond then.

In the meantime, JDS said it would continue to reduce expenses
while funding development of new products.  "We believe these next-
generation systems will be part of a future industry recovery and
that we are well positioned to help our company and our customers
return to growth," the firm said.

JDS's cost-cutting measures thus far have produced $600 million of
annual savings, with another $200 million of savings targeted.=20
Included in the downsizing have been substantial layoffs and
closure of 17 manufacturing facilities.  The cuts in operating
expenses have not come cheaply.  Through the end of September, JDS
took $778 million of charges related to cost saving efforts.  It
expects up to $172 million in additional charges to complete the
program.

MOODY's DOWNGRADES AT&T's DEBT RATINGS

Moody's Investors Service reduced AT&T Corp.'s debt ratings and
said it might issue further downgrades.  The core telephony unit
was downgraded to "A-3" from "A-2" and the less creditworthy
broadband cable TV division was lowered to "Baa-1" from "A-3."  The
ratings on AT&T's short-term debt were lowered from "prime-1," the
highest rating on such debt, to "prime-2."

Moody's new ratings on AT&T are roughly equivalent to those of
another big rating agency, Fitch.  But they are one notch below
where Standard & Poor's rates the company.  AT&T's ratings are
under review at S&P and might be lowered in the near future.  The
downgrades can add to AT&T's cost of raising funds in the debt
market, but AT&T's debt securities still are considered "investment
grade."

Moody's said its downgrade reflected "the deterioration in the
prospective performance of the company's telephony operations and
concerns that debt reduction efforts from the sale or monetization
of noncore assets are likely to fall short of previous
expectations."

"Moody's expects profitability to decline over the intermediate
term as [Bell companies] are permitted to enter the long distance
business in more and more states," the rating agency said.  "There
is not, at this time, a clear-cut growth area to offset this
decline."

Bear, Stearns & Co. debt-market analyst Marion Boucher Soper said
"the downgrade should not come as a surprise given that [AT&T's]
ratings have been under review for downgrade since the announcement
of its restructuring" a year ago.

The federal government's process for allocating spectrum is
inefficient, with too many frequencies reserved for low-value uses
and too few dedicated to high-value purposes, according to an
analysis funded by the wireless industry.  "The bottom line is that
inefficient spectrum allocation imposes costs on the economy by
discouraging innovation, raising costs to consumers, and otherwise
reducing the benefits that consumers and businesses would have
obtained from new wireless technologies," said the analysis, which
was commissioned by the Cellular Telecommunications & Internet
Association and prepared by Sebago Associates, Inc., an economic
policy consulting firm.  More spectrum should be allocated for
commercial wireless services, and the FCC should permit licensees
to trade spectrum in secondary markets, the analysis said.  Among
the authors of the study was Martin N. Baily, a senior fellow at
