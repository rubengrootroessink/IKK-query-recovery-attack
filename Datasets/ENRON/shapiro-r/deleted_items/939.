I am flying to Pensacola late this afternoon.  My contact info (in addition to my cellphone and blackberry) is 850-916-9332, through Saturday.    

If there is any update, I am reachable until about 4 today (EST).  I am reachable in Pensacola all of tomorrow too.   If we don't talk, please have a great time in the Big Easy and lots of good Turkey cheer!
