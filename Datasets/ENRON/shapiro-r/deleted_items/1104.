	Hi, Richard!

We've improved the Classmates newsletter!

Now the Classmates newsletter is better than ever. Every issue has a customized listing of all your friends and classmates who have recently registered with Classmates. That means finding your friends is as easy as checking your email. Here's a sneak peek:

Newington High School <http://www.classmates.com/go/e/114313611/MSA111401B/CM08/1550>
133 new classmates have joined.
View these classmates now! <http://www.classmates.com/go/e/114313611/MSA111401B/CM08/1550>

Celebrate the Holidays with Classmates

Another new feature is our Holiday HQ <http://www.classmates.com/go/e/114313611/MSA111401B/CM134H> where you can get tips on preparing a tasty turkey, post your own holiday photos (as a Gold member), and get amazing deals for holiday shopping.

We hope you enjoy these exciting improvements. Visit Classmates today <http://www.classmates.com/go/e/114313611/MSA111401B/CM19H> and see what's new for you!
