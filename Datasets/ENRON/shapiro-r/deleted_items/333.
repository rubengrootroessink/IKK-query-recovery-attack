Rick, I'm following up on our earlier conversation about Enron's leadership role in our committees.  I need to give the Public Affairs slot to another company, in order to spread the wealth around.  Things are still in flux but I'm proposing to the Exec Committee that Jeff Keeler take over the Environmental Committee.  That is obviously becoming an increasingly important committee as Congress and the Administration look at air pollutant regulation changes, and I know Enron is taking an activist role.  Do you have a problem with this?  Lynne
