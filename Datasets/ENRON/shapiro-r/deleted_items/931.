Rick

Thanks for your encouraging words during the last few days. I have to say t=
hat despite all the difficulties we have had to endure over the past few mo=
nths, Enron remains the best place I have ever worked.This is due, in no sm=
all part, to the great people I share this place with.=20

I also owe you an overdue e-mail on the Mexico matter. As I had indicated, =
I have decided not to take the offer. I have spoken to a number of friends =
and associates who live in Monterrey and their views are pretty unanimous: =
Monterrey is a great place to live if one is already settled with a family,=
 but it is altogther different and more difficult for a  single man. Theref=
ore, despite the professional opportunity to work with a great team, I have=
 decided not accept the offer.=20

Many thanks for keeping me  in mind, being patient, and moving things along=
. I will be in touch in the next couple of days. Enjoy your holiday.=20

Best regards,=20
Paul

=09Subject:=09American Thanksgiving
=09Importance:=09High



=09A few months ago, I sent a note to the North American Government Affairs=
 group commemorating a bit of an end point in our efforts relative to Calif=
ornia.  In that memo, I included a quote that went as follows ? "What we do=
 in life echoes through eternity".  I think of these words often and believ=
e them more than ever, particularly after the events, both external and int=
ernal to Enron, of the last few months.  I do not know for sure what the ne=
xt few weeks or months will bring for any of us, but I do know that what we=
've done here at Enron in Government Affairs over the last several years, w=
hether in Houston, Washington, London, Brussels, Sao Paulo, etc. was very g=
ood and will be remembered for the positive difference that we have all mad=
e in the industries in which we have worked and for each other.  We even ha=
d a good time doing it.  The good work we do will go on for many, if not, a=
ll of us . . . for some, here; for others, elsewhere. =20

=09Regardless of what the future holds, we should all be quite proud of wha=
t we have accomplished here and how it has been accomplished.  My personal =
appreciation for all that you have done as well as at having had the opport=
unity to be part of a group that, unfortunately, will be inalterably impact=
ed and changed over the next few weeks, is boundless.  Irrespective of wher=
e these changes may take any one of us, I will continue to do all I can to =
earn your trust and respect. =20

=09On a more holiday-related note, for those in the U.S., who are working t=
his week, please feel free to leave as early as possible on Wednesday in ad=
vance of Thanksgiving to spend time with your families or loved ones.  For =
those not celebrating the American Thanksgiving, you too should try and tak=
e some additional time for yourself and families over the next few days, wo=
rk and business demands permitting.

=09Thank you.
