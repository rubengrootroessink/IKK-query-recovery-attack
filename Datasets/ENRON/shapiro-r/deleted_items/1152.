Please add a note to fill out the spreadsheet in the electronic file and e-mail it back to me (Elizabeth).

Thanks.

I'll be talking about this more on Monday's Direct Reports call, but I need your help( each of you) in completing the attachment, which consists of three separate spreadsheets( three scenarios), by COB Wednesday, October 3 ,2001..... pertaining to all outside services for 2002( "identified" costs and "anticipated" costs-RCR"S). Thanks in advance for your timely help.Also. feel free to call me if you have any questions.


 

You might want to mention in your note that there is a spreadsheet for each scenario.
