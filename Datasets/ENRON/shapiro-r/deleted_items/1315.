  <http://ww3.weatherbug.com/email_drops/servicemagic/email_sm_people2.gif>  <http://ww3.weatherbug.com/email_drops/servicemagic/clear.gif>I just have to say how AWESOME your company has been! In just 24 hours, you have managed to provide us with three referrals as well as keep us informed throughout the entire process! You are too good to be true!! I know why your name is Service "Magic" - you are just that!
Tina L. - Denver, CO

Your service is great. I had been asking my husband to find someone to fix our fence for months. I told him that we should contact ServiceMagic and in two days we had someone to do the job and in three days it was complete. What a relief. You have a permanent customer with us. Thanks again.
Deborah F. - Cerritos, CA

I am so happy to have found you! I am a single mom, I live on a corner lot, and every year I seem to be able to only invest in small projects. I am excited to save time - I won't have to use the phone book anymore! Again, your site has become my knight in shining armor. Thank you.
Terri T. - Ogden, Utah

We look forward to working for you,

Mike Beaudoin & Rodney Rice
