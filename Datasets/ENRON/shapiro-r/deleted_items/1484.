Hi Rick,

Thanks for your kind note.  I know I really appreciated it, and I'm sure ev=
eryone else does, too.

I just talked with Ginger and she mentioned that Amy is travelling this wee=
k, too, and won't be able to get home from Pittsburgh until Friday.  I'm su=
re it must be hard for both of you to be away from the boys at this time.  =
Eric is planning to call your house to see if there's anything we can do to=
 help while you're away.  Our kids would love to have Ben and Jonathan over=
 to play any time.  Please encourage your mother-in-law and your au pair to=
 let us know if there's anything we can do to help.

Take care,

Sue

 each of you and the personal and professional sacrifices you make...more t=

    With your continuing efforts, I am quite confident that the company wil=

First of all, welcome back!  I have always been proud to be part of the "Ke=

I felt compelled to write this note to you after listening to the questions=

I agree that we have outstanding leadership talent at Enron.  I report dire=

Rick.  He embraces the visions and values that you talked about this mornin=

Thank you for your loyalty to our company, and to its employees.  =20
