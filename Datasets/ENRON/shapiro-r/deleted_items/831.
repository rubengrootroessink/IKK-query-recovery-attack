Clark:   In a change of plans, I will be in the office through Wednesday
if any of those days  were to work. Otherwise, I'll look forward to
hearing from you next week to arrange a continuation of our discussions.
Thanks and have a great holiday if we don't hook up before then.    Rick

Thanks again for taking the time to meet with me today. I enjoyed our
visit and remain very interested in the opportunity at El Paso. I
believe I can make a difference and build a merchant regulatory function
that will add value and be respected in the industry. Feel free to call
Steve Kean at 713-853-1586. I'd also be happy to give you some
additional names. Thanks again.
