They are separate reports that cover the same time period.  API is put out by the American Petroleum Institute and is issued on Tuesday afternoon.  EIA puts out their numbers on Wednesday.  The weekly numbers reported in the two reports often vary and sometimes this variance is significant but over time the numbers in the two reports fall back in-line with one another.

US crude oil inventory information is compiled by API and by the US EIA DOE.  Both utilize information collected from company surveys along with their own estimation methodologies.  A recent EIA DOE report (attached) lists the information forms from which the EIA DOE collects data.  A summary of API sources of data, collecting and auditing procedures, and estimation methodology utilized in publishing the API Weekly Statistical Bulletin can be obtained from API for $52.  Please advise if you wish to obtain this API report.
