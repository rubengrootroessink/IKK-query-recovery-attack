Amr - 
 
Per your request, attached is an excel spreadsheet that lists all 2001 RCRs sorted by type and department head.
 
There are a number of RCRs that have multiple types (e.g. - Advocacy / Deal Support / Origination / Risk Management) and I have put those types of RCRs together.
 
There are totals for amount requested, amount approved and amount spent to date for each type with a grand total for all types.
 
Please advise of any questions, comments or concerns.
 
Eric
