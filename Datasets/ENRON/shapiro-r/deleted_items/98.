Dear Richard,

Thank you for choosing WorldCom Conferencing for your virtual meeting needs. I'm sending this message as a follow-up to the conference call you held with WorldCom in the last few weeks. With our conferencing services, you now have the flexibility to conduct meetings anytime, anywhere. We can help you maximize your productivity, communicate more swiftly and drive cost savings straight to your bottom line. 

You can create meetings to match your precise business needs by choosing from our wide variety of conferencing features and service levels. For example, if you request a question and answer session, you will need the assistance of a conference coordinator and our Premier Service. 

The following service levels are available: 


Premier Service: Ideal for planning high-visibility meetings, presentations to large groups or any other event that requires a dedicated meeting manager and operator to handle your call from start to finish.

Standard Service: Ideal for planning meetings for medium-sized groups, such as staff, training or project management meetings. 

Unattended Service: Ideal for small internal meetings not requiring operator assistance. 

Instant Meeting: Reservationless conferencing allows you to hold meetings at any time, without reservations and without operator assistance.

Enhance your next meeting with Net Conferencing services. Participants can view meeting materials over the Internet while they attend meetings on the telephone. Enhanced features now allow you to conduct online polls, respond to questions, and chat interactively with other participants, all via the Internet.

You may also be interested in our monthly Meeting Matters email newsletter, which features current news on leveraging conferencing for business success. You can sign up to receive it every month via email by visiting <http://www.e-meetings.wcom.com>

Please feel free to contact me if you have questions. I can be reached at 800-480-3600. If you need to reserve your next conference, simply call us at 800-475-5000 or reserve your conference online via e-Scheduling.

Sincerely,

Rich Christiansen 
WorldCom Conferencing
