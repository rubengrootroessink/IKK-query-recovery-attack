It has come to my attention that our mailings for the Energy Subcommittee
have not arrived in your hands due to delayed mail.  Please let me know if
you need an agenda and if you will be attending the meeting.  The meeting is
scheduled for Friday, Nov. 9 at the Austin Renaissance Hotel in Austin, TX.
From 8-5pm.  The meeting will be followed by the Environmental Health
Academy kick-off dinner Friday evening.

I have RSVP's from:
Walt Buccholtz
Bill Rozett
Rep. Joe Green
Rep. Jim Ports
Rep. Cheryl Chase
  

This is unusually low....and does not constitute a quorum.
