Montana Power:=20
Problems Continue to Overshadow Transformation Into Touch America



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis


[News item from CBS MarketWatch] Montana Power shares fell on Nov. 16, a da=
y after the utility posted a loss for its third quarter, citing the slowdow=
n in the economy and the company's transition from a diversified energy com=
pany to a stand-alone telecommunications firm. The stock fell to a 52-week =
low of $4.05 earlier in the session. It closed Nov. 16 at $4.18, down 52 ce=
nts. As of early morning trading on Nov. 19, Montana Power shares remained =
at $4.18.=20

Analysis: There is little doubt that Montana Power currently finds itself a=
t a challenging crossroads. The company remains in the midst of becoming so=
lely a telecommunications operation, having sold off much of its utility ho=
ldings. However, the process has hit several snags, including an incomplete=
 transfer of its transmission and distribution unit to Northwestern Corp. C=
ompounding Montana Power's current problems is a weakened financial perform=
ance, which continues to worsen and also leaves little capital to build the=
 telecom business. In addition, the company faces a host of related challen=
ges, including uncertainty about the final regulatory approval needed for t=
he asset sale to Northwestern, requests for rate increases to fund the purc=
hase of power that Montana Power must buy on the wholesale market, and insp=
ection of the long-term power-purchase contracts that the company has forme=
d with various suppliers. The question that investors should be asking with=
 regard to Montana Power's current plight is whether or not the financial l=
osses and resulting drop in stock price represent a temporary setback or so=
me larger indication of doubt about the company's viability as a telecom op=
eration.=20

For its third quarter 2001, Montana Power posted a loss of $27.5 million, o=
r 26 cents a share, representing a $57.3-million swing from its 3Q 2000 pro=
fit of $30.4 million, or 29 cents a share. During the third quarter of 2000=
, Montana Power had reported a net income of $31.3 million. Montana Power h=
as noted that the losses in the current quarter were not solely related to =
Touch America, but also included a $14.8-million pre-tax write-down of inve=
stments in two other telecommunications companies. One had filed for bankru=
ptcy and the other defaulted on loans that Montana Power had helped guarant=
ee. In addition, company officials have attributed the loss to price decrea=
ses and the slowing economy. However, note that the current third-quarter l=
osses followed losses in the second quarter as well. Specifically, the comp=
any reported a net loss of $10.9 million, or 11 cents a share, in the 2Q 20=
01, compared with net income of $35.5 million, or 34 cents a share, in the =
second quarter of 2000. The company also previously reduced its expectation=
s of revenue growth in 2001 to 10 percent from 25 percent. According to Mon=
tana Power's CEO Bob Gannon, the company is merely experiencing a "short-te=
rm liquidity problem."=20

Nevertheless, to say that Montana Power is having some growing pains is an =
understatement. Since March 2000, it has been Montana Power's goal to total=
ly divest all of its energy assets and re-emerge as a debt-free communicati=
ons company, operating under the name of Touch America (presently the compa=
ny's telecom subsidiary), with zero debt, $350 million in cash and 26,000 m=
iles of fiber communications lines. CEO Gannon originally envisioned, and c=
ontinues to see, Touch America as one of the largest broadband companies in=
 the country and a more lucrative business model than the formerly integrat=
ed Montana Power. Much of the transition has already taken place, consideri=
ng that Montana Power has successfully divested its oil and gas, coal and i=
ndependent power production businesses. As noted, the last piece of the puz=
zle is the sale of its electric and natural-gas utility operations to North=
western Corp., a provider of electricity, natural-gas and communications se=
rvices to Midwestern customers. This is a big piece of the puzzle, however,=
 as Touch America is counting on proceeds from the distribution sale to sup=
port continued growth.=20

Therein lies one of the main challenges for Montana Power. The Montana Publ=
ic Service Commission is the last regulatory agency that needs to approve t=
he sale of these assets. Some analysts have suggested that Montana Power's =
financial problems can be resolved only if the Montana Public Service Commi=
ssion approves the sale of the electric and natural-gas distribution system=
s, which could inject some $460 million in Touch America's operations. Yet,=
 state regulators are ensuring that the state consumer counsel's office, wh=
ich represents ratepayers in utility cases, and a group of large industrial=
 electricity users also have an opportunity to raise any concerns about the=
 proposed sale of the assets. The less time provided for equal-opportunity =
review and comment could increase the likelihood that the sale could be cha=
llenged down the line.=20

After some early deliberation, the Montana Public Service Commission has no=
w agreed to review the $1.1-billion proposed sale of the assets to Northwes=
tern Corp. by Jan. 31, 2002, although lawyers for Montana Power are still l=
obbying to have this review moved up to December. Part of the pressure for =
the review, the company's attorneys have argued, is that if the sale is not=
 approved by the end of the year, investors and lenders may lose patience r=
egarding the uncertainty of the deal and refuse to provide any further capi=
tal support into the growing Touch America. Furthermore, the viability of t=
he entire business plan for Touch America could be brought into question if=
 this asset sale is not approved by state regulators, considering that Mont=
ana Power is counting on proceeds from the sale to support growth of the ne=
w telecom company. The sales agreement between Montana Power and Northweste=
rn Corp. expires March 31, 2002, so time is also a factor.=20

Another issue that has yet to be resolved is Montana Power's intent to rais=
e rates to support purchases of wholesale power. In other words, as a tange=
ntial issue related to the sale of its assets, state regulators also questi=
on how Montana Power will recover certain power-supply costs as it continue=
s to morph into a telecom business. The company has established that it exp=
ects to pay nearly $2 billion over the next 30 years for wholesale power pu=
rchases that have been necessitated by its transition to a telecom company =
from a utility holding company, and hopes to increase electric rates by 20 =
percent to support these expenses. Montana Power is still considered the de=
fault provider to about 288,000 customers, and needs an average of 670 MW f=
or its customers. However, the company also needs to keep a total of 1,050 =
MW as a peak load during the winter months and aims to keep 100 MW of reser=
ve power.=20

Since the company voluntarily divested its own generation facilities to PPL=
 Corp., it must procure its entire load on the open market at rates set by =
the Montana Public Service Commission. The 20-percent rate increase reporte=
dly would increase residential electricity rates by about $2.00 a month sta=
rting in July 2002, making the average bill about $64 per month. In additio=
n to the projected 20-percent increase for residential customers, Montana P=
ower estimated that small businesses could see their rates increase by 21 p=
ercent and medium industrial customers could see a 36-percent increase. It =
is important to note that a recent survey by the Great Falls Tribune conclu=
ded that, the increase in Montana Power's rates would produce some of the h=
ighest residential electric rates in the Northwest.=20

Montana Power is attempting to establish long-term power contracts with sup=
pliers to meet its entire load requirements. For instance, Montana Power fo=
rmed a buy-back agreement with PPL as a condition of the generation sale tw=
o years ago. This contract expires July 1, 2002. Beyond that date, Montana =
Power announced that it signed a one-year contract to buy 111 MW from Duke =
Energy at an undisclosed price. PPL also has formed a new contract to provi=
de 450 MW to Montana Power over a five-year period after its current contra=
ct expires. Northwestern Power, the purchaser of Montana Power's distributi=
on system, has said that it wants Montana Power to assemble a diverse packa=
ge of power-purchase deals (instead of buying all its load from one source)=
 to encourage the development of new generation sources in the region. Mont=
ana Power has reportedly submitted a portfolio of power-purchase deals to t=
he Montana Public Service Commission to determine the inclusion of those de=
als within the rate structure, and the portfolio contains about three-fourt=
hs of the 1,129 MW that Montana Power will need to cover its peak demand of=
 customers and maintain an adequate reserve. The company will probably purc=
hase the balance of its requirements on the short-term market.=20

Also, on the legal front, Montana Power continues to navigate through at le=
ast two litigious proceedings. First, in August, a group of Montana Power s=
hareholders initiated a lawsuit against the utility, claiming the company's=
 effort to get out of the electricity business was illegal and cost them $3=
 billion in lost stock value. The complaint, filed in the District Court at=
 Butte, said the sale of Montana Power generation plants to PPL Montana in =
December 1999 was done without the required shareholder approval and should=
 be overturned. The suit also asks for a court order putting the plants and=
 an estimated $100 million in profits realized by PPL from operating the pl=
ants into a trust until the case is resolved. What this means is that the s=
ale of Montana Power's generation assets are in a state of litigation, even=
 though the sale of the generation assets was completed two years ago. Anot=
her lawsuit is related to Montana Power's $200-million purchase last year o=
f Qwest Communications' long-distance and other telephone businesses within=
 a 14-state service area. Essentially, Montana Power has launched a suit ag=
ainst Qwest, alleging that Qwest has violated anti-trust laws and constrain=
ed competition in the long-distance and voice and data market.=20

Consequently, as Montana Power closes out the year and hits the two-year ma=
rk in its transformation into Touch America, the future for the company loo=
ks rather questionable. Although there are market doubts about the future o=
f the telecom sector, Montana Power remains confident that its long-term pr=
ospects as a telecom company remain very strong. Nevertheless, the current =
question for investors is how quickly and how successfully Montana can comp=
lete its transformation into Touch America. In other words, what Montana Po=
wer sees on the horizon may not be so easily reached. The path to the compa=
ny's final destination is obviously marked by several financial and legal o=
bstacles.=20
