Hi Paul,

These documents reflect the collective edits of Sarah, Rick and myself.  Please let me know if you have any additional suggestions.  I hope you're feeling better,

Sue


Rick and Sarah:  I don't have the list of Enron affiliates affected by the prohibition on trading with the utilities or the list of Enron affiliates with market-based rate authority.  Where can I get that?  Thanks.
