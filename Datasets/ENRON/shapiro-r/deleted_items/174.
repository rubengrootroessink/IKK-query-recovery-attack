I recall your reluctance to prepay too much stuff in 2002.  Do you want to pay WPTF this year?

Every year we've tried to pre-pay some bills.  Or make sure the Dec bills come in in time to get paid in Dec.  Do we want to do that this year as well?  I'm thinking of bills like the WPTF $15,000 to be on the Board.
