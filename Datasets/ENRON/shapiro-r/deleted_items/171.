Lisa - as you probably know, the Pitt seam is characterised by a few domina=
nt players, most notably Consol and RAG.  Consol, especially, is resistant =
to our business model (transparency, liquidity).  We have heard that they a=
re putting clauses into contracts that prohibit the resale of their coal, b=
y their utility customers.  I used to know more about this area of the law,=
 but isn't this impermissible?  If so, (but don't do this, yet), is it poss=
ible to give DOJ a "heads up", so they could send appropriate demands for i=
nformation?  We definitely would not want our fingerprints on this.  Policy=
makers should be on our side, as a matter of energy policy, because in time=
s like these, when coal supplies are still tight, you want free movement of=
 the commodity to where it is needed, when it is needed, rather than creati=
ng artificial shortages because someone long Pitt seam coal cannot re-sell =
it.  Also, such restrictions are likely to inhibit development of effective=
 risk management mechanisms, like the Northerern App. contract that Alleghe=
ny has been talking about (and which I understand we might put on EOL, if/w=
hen the contract is developed).  Your thoughts?   thanks  mcs
