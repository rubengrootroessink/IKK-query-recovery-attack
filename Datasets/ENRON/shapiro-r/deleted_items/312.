McGreevey Again Shows That He's the Right Choice for New Jersey


Jim McGreevey tonight exposed Bret Schundler's shell game on education and 
his plan to drain money from the public schools in order to subsidize a 
handful of private school students.  McGreevey also exposed Schundler's 
duplicity on gun control issues and his answers on the Christian Coalition 
questionnaire.

McGreevey again laid out the clearest argument why he shares the mainstream 
values of New Jersey's working class families and will bring the right kind 
of leadership and vision to the state.

He detailed his plans to improve New Jersey's public schools, not abandon 
them.  He showed his commitment to put good drivers before auto insurance 
companies, rather than allowing them to set their own rates and write their 
own rules.  He made it clear that he will veto any attempt to weaken the 
state's strong gun control laws and bring the right kind of leadership to 
ensure the safety and security of New Jersey's families.

On issue after issue, the stark contrast between the two candidates was 
clear.  Jim McGreevey showed he will be a Governor who will provide real 
property tax relief and fight for middle class New Jersey families.  He 
demonstrated that he will tackle waste and mismanagement and force 
government to live within its means.  He made it clear that he is the only 
candidate for Governor who will protect a woman's right to choose.

Mayor McGreevey's opponent on the other hand continued to run away from and 
blur his own unpopular positions on the key issues in this campaign.  He 
soft-peddled his opposition to a woman's right to choose. He also once again 
contradicted his previous promise that he would sign a new law to allow 
people to carry concealed weapons, and he contradicted his own stated 
opposition to licensing and registration of handguns.

Mr. Schundler also acknowledged his private school voucher program would 
drain nearly $600 million from our public schools.

The choice for Governor of New Jersey is clear.  Jim McGreevey is the only 
candidate for Governor who will put New Jersey's working families first by 
fighting for issues that matter most too them.  He will give this state the 
leadership it deserves and he will make sure government works for the right 
change.
