FYI.  El Paso Merchant is advocating the gathering of financial information 
on the gas markets.  As Leslie says, this may be their quiet method of 
highlighting the role of Enron in the market.

Maybe this is how they think they will turn the attention to Enron.

		 Subject: El Paso Merchant Comments on Reporting Requirements

El Paso Merchant filed comments yesterday in the Reporting Requirements 
docket.  They did not argue against the collection of the new proposed data, 
but rather argued that the Commission needed to add to the information to be 
gathered to include financial market data.  El Paso states that the financial 
market is believed to be ten times as large as the physical market.  El Paso 
suggests the following information be collected:
the name of the counter party to the financial trade
the quantitiy of gas underlying the financial trade
all the pricing terms of the trade stated in price per MMBtu
the time period of the trade, including starting and ending dates
the date on which the deal was entered into
the type of trade

El Paso Merchant also argues for confidential treatment and a sunset date for 
the collection of the data (tied to when EIA finds supply and demand in 
California in balance.)

I have a fax of the comments, but do not yet have them electronically.  Let 
me know if you want a copy faxed.
