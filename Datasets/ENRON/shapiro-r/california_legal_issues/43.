This is potentially important.  If FERC were to grant Puget's request to 
dismiss and withdraw its complaint, it could undercut the suggestion made to 
Ray A. by a FERC staffer at a recent meeting that FERC could potentially 
order WSCC refunds prior to the July 2, 2001 refund effective date 
established in the June 19 Order (which FERC could attempt to do by revising 
its previous dismissal of Puget's complaint on rehearing, which is pending.)

My guess is that FERC will not wish to give up the leverage that it has on 
this front, and thus will sit on Puget's motion to withdrawal for the time 
being while the settlement efforts are ongoing.

Attached is Puget's 06/22/2001Motion to dismiss & notice of withdrawal of 
pleadings of Puget Sound Energy, Inc re all jurisdictional sellers of energy 
and/or capacity at wholesale into electric energy and/or capacity markets in 
the Pacific Northwest etc, EL01-10.

FERC acceptance of this withdrawal would resolve the concern about the 
potential for an earlier refund effective date for prices charged in the WSCC.
