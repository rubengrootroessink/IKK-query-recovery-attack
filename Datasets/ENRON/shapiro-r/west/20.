Our efforts with the Governors have been productive from a GA standpoint and may be prove fruitful from a business develop standpoint as well.  Given FERC's issuance of their price cap order, Sue, Scott and I have been reviewing various options for staying relevant to the Governors.  

We submit that we can stay relevant to the Governors and continue to provide positive value to our national efforts by moving our message from "neither price caps nor balkanization shall you support," to 

?	we need RTO West and Desert Star now--i.e., set some deadlines FERC
?	long-term portfolio management is a good thing
?	core/noncore is a reasonable risk management tool
?	there are certain provisions of the "Democratic" energy plan and the Bush plan that we can all support--see below.

We've scheduled meetings with Gov. Leavitt's office in mid-July and will begin our outreach to Gov. Kitzhapper and Gov. Locke after we discuss the above.    If interested, I'll ask Lysa to set up a conference call to discuss.

Per our conversation this morning, here are a program and messages for our western democratic governor friends:

Open Access to transmission in the West / creation of Western RTO
Double the Administration's  LIHEAP and weatherization program budgets 
Streamline FERC's permitting process for approval of new pipeline siting and construction.
"EXCEED" Tax Credit: 10% investment tax credit for the cost of clean air control technology for utilities that lead a power plant to exceed mandatory emissions reduction levels for pollutants regulated under Title I of the Clean Air Act, or for significant early compliance with clean air emissions reduction target dates.  This credit would be applied on a sliding scale and public utilities and coops would be permitted to trade the credits or use them as offsets against debt or obligation in lieu of tax credits
CARE Fund: "Conservation And Renewable Energy" Public Benefits Fund.  To provide grants and flexible financing for rapid development of renewable energy generation and to maximize energy conservation and efficiency.  

These are a few programs that I think we could find agreement on.  Let me know if I'm on the right track or not.  Thanks.
