Here's the draft letter for Locke and a summary of the bill (FYI).   The 
pertinent section of the bill is section 3--although other sections of the 
bill may provide opportunities for:

 EES:  state agencies and school districts are required to complete energy 
audits and implement cost-effective conservation, with performance contracts 
being the preferred method; and
ENA:  utilities (both COUs and IOUs) must offer renewable energy products to 
customers.

We need to get our letter in the hopper ASAP.  Please ask Ginger to fed ex 
the signed letter to our lobbyist Mark Greenberg so Mark can deliver it to 
the Governor's office.    Mark's address is 

2205 East Bay Drive
Olympia, Washington 98506
360.786.9600

(Have fed ex leave it at Mark's door if he isn't there.)



There is some concern that Locke will line item veto portions of the bill as 
it was a last-minute compromise.    However, his support appears to be 
holding for the entire package.  

I'm in the office tomorrow (Weds) and in Sacto on Thursday.  Give me a call 
if you have any questions.
