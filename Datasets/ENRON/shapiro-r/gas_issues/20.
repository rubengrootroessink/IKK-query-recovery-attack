Please see the attached memo from INGAA regarding a meeting they and Joe 
Hartsoe had with Dan Larcamp as a follow up to the meeting Rick, Linda and I 
had with Dan Larcamp a couple of weeks ago.  INGAA asks that we not circulate 
the memo widely.  

We need to discuss what, if any, response ENA needs to make.  Donna and I 
have been talking about this and we will set up a conference call with the 
gas group to discuss further.  Please let us know if you have any questions 
or comments.

Sarah
