We are long and short varying mws under different desks tomorrow at different 
prices...  All deals need to be made per instructions.

First:
ST-CALI
We are short 100 mws for HE 7 in SP-15 at $220.  Please make the Enpower as a 
buy from counterparty under ST-Cali.  We will then need to zero out a 
imbalance purchase under ST-Cali and then zero out the short in ST-Cali in 
SP-15 in CAPS.
We are long 25 mws for HE 7-22 in NP-15 at $290.  We can move this out using 
Turlock, Modesto or Dynegy.  The account numbers are in the sheet.  The 
newest account is Turlock to SNPD #790617.  All deals need to be under 
ST-CALI.  Again we need to zero out the imbalance sale, so that we are flat.

WEST SERVICES
We are short 8 mws in SP-15 for HE 7-22 at $171.  The service desk has put in 
a purchase from the imbalance (Enpower #579037).  We need to zero this out, 
make a purchase from a counterparty under our book (ST-Whourly), then make a 
sale to the services book in SP-15.

ST_WBOM
We are long 20 mws at MEAD 230 from the services desk tomorrow HE 11-16.  We 
need to submit the transmission request to NEVP(services has already made the 
enpower), then we need to either input the power and use NCPA to run it 
across the path or sell it outright.  We are long at $150.  The Epmicalpoos 
and the sales need to be under ST-WBOM.

Any questions...please give me a call.  503-887-3449.

Thanks in advance.
Bill
