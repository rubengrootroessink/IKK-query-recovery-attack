The latest version of the SAP GUI 4.6D will be available after 5:30 pm today 
(4/6/01).  This version of the GUI resolves some compatibility problems and 
enables some functionality for H/R and A/P Workflow users.  

The next time you access SAP by clicking Start -------> Programs -------> 
Business Applications -------> SAPlogon, the install of the latest version of 
the SAP GUI will occur.  This will take several minutes.  After the install 
is complete, you will be instructed to re-boot your computer.  Once the 
re-boot is done, you can access SAP by clicking Start -------> Programs 
-------> Business Applications -------> SAPlogon.

If you have an existing SAPlogon icon on your desktop, it will no longer use 
the most recent SAP GUI script.
