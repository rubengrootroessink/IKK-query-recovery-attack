for us to have a successful Walk this Saturday!

What time does the Walk begin and how far is it?
The Walk begins at 9:00 am =01) rain or shine!  You can elect to walk in th=
e 5K=20
or 10K =01) no decision or commitment needs to be made; just decide the day=

ng=20
your own pooper-scoopers for this purpose.=20

Where do I meet up with TEAM ENRON?
TEAM ENRON walkers will meet around 8:30 am near Salmon Street Springs =01)=
 look=20
for the TEAM ENRON sign.  There will be lots of activity and people in this=
=20
area, so plan ahead to meet up with your fellow TEAM ENRON walkers no later=
=20
than 8:45 am. =20

I haven=01,t received my TEAM ENRON t-shirt =01) what do I do?
Because of the number of TEAM ENRON registrants and the various locations o=
f=20
our TEAM walkers, it may not be possible to deliver t-shirts to each walker=
. =20
Therefore, if you HAVE NOT received your TEAM ENRON t-shirt by the end of t=
he=20
work day on Friday, April 20, please plan on picking up your t-shirt betwee=
n=20
8:00-8:30 am on Walk Day.  Pick-up location will be at One World Trade Cent=
er=20
on the Bridge Level (at the top of the escalators).  T-shirts will be=20
distributed at this location from 8:00-8:30 am  ONLY..

Am I suppose to wear my TEAM ENRON t-shirt at the Walk?
Yes, yes, yes!  As the title sponsor of this year=01,s Walk for the state o=
f=20
Oregon, we want to show off our name and support for this great cause! =20

What if I have NOT turned in my pledge form to a Team Captain before the Wa=
lk?
No problem.  We encourage you to turn in your pledges at the MS registratio=
n=20
tables at Two World Trade Center prior to the Walk that morning.  Most of y=
ou=20
have received the yellow notice and white envelope in the mail from the MS=
=20
Society.  This envelope is to be used to put your pledge form and collected=

dollars/checks in.  If you did NOT receive the yellow notice and white=20

e=20
an MS walk t-shirt.  (For those that have already turned in their pledges=
=20
prior to Saturday, the MS Walk t-shirt will be delivered or sent to you.)

I thought I was pre-registered and the pledges would be picked up prior to=
=20
the Walk.
Again, because of the various locations for our Walkers, it may not be=20
possible to pick up all pledges.   If your pledge form is NOT picked up pri=
or=20
to the end of the work day this Friday, you will need to do the following:

form. (You will only receive your MS Walk t-shirt once your pledge forms ha=

er=20
the day of event?
Absolutely.  Send that friend to the =01&Walk On=01,s=018 table in the Regi=
stration=20

=20
contributions.  If you have not completed a matching form, please contact=
=20
your team captain.  These employee contributions are matched 100% and adds =
up=20
easily.

Is this tax-deductible and how are receipts given?
You bet it is tax-deductible.  If a pledge is $75 or greater, a=20
tax-deductible receipt will be sent directly from the MS Society.  However,=
=20
if the pledge is less than $75 and a receipt is requested, a receipt needs =
to=20
be provided by the Walker.  You can pick these receipts up at the MS=20
Registration Table or contact Judy Timson, 503/886-0501 or email her at=20
judy_timson@enron.net.

How does this work for TEAM ENRON prizes IF my pledge form does not get=20

round-trip airline tickets on Continental Airlines. In order to be eligible=

=20

Are TEAM ENRON walkers to meet after the Walk?
No, due to participating in the 5K or 10K and due to people=01,s own walkin=
g=20
times, it would be difficult to hold a gathering afterwards.  However, we=
=20
encourage all TEAM ENRON walkers to enjoy the activities, booths, music,=20
refreshments, food, etc., that will be provided at the end of the Walk.
