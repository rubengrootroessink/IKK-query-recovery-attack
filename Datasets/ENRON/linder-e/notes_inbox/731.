Over the last couple of years we have had numerous social events including 
holiday parties, company-sponsored outings to Edgefield, post-quarterly 
meeting outings, and going away parties.  While I hope that people thoroughly 
enjoy themselves, I ask that you keep in mind that we all have to act 
professionally and responsibly during and after these events.  I have been 
working with Chris Calger and Amy Fitzpatrick to put together some guidelines 
for company-sponsored social events:

The company will provide soft drinks, beer, and wine.  You may choose to 
order other beverages at your expense.
Functions will run for a specified period of time.  If there is an open bar, 
we will establish a time certain after which Enron will not pay for any 
additional drinks.
If you require assisance getting home, please contact a taxi and submit the 
fare for expense reimbursement with no questions asked.  The last thing in 
the world we want is to have people break the law or put their safety and the 
safety of others in jeopardy.

Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks for your cooperation.
