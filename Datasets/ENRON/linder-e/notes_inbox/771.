We will have the phones for this weekend for Enron Canada.  We will get the 
phones at 6 on Friday (or thereabouts) and will have them till 6 on Sunday 
morning (or thereaboot).  Same as before.  We need to update the calgary log 
on explorer and the written log (in the white Canada binder) if there are any 
rerates.  Please contact Bill Greenizian, John Zufferli or myself with 
questions.

I will be in Las Vegas through Sunday but will be reachable on my cell at 
503-887-3449 to answer any questions.

Thanks,
Bill
