View your SAP Inbox directly in Outlook! Introducing the SAP Office=20
Connector!=20
The SAP Office Connector is a piece of software that seamlessly displays yo=
ur=20
SAP Office folders as Outlook folders. You already have the SAP Office=20
Connector if you have the new SAPGUI 4.6D installed. If you are an SAP user=
,=20
there are several reasons why you might receive an SAP Office message:=20
? You are the agent for an SAP workflow item=20
? An error has occurred for which you are the person responsible=20
? Someone (or some process) just sent you SAP mail
You can launch attached links to SAP transactions directly from Outlook,=20
including workflow tasks!
Use of the SAP Office Connector is optional. If you use SAP only to enter=
=20
your timesheet information, you probably won=01,t get much mail in your SAP=
=20
Inbox - and so probably won=01,t benefit from using this product.
In most cases, it will make sense to use the SAP Office Connector to view=
=20
your SAP notifications INSTEAD of forwarding them out of SAP to your Enron=
=20
Internet mail address.  If you have configured your SAP Office to forward=
=20
your mail, you should delete the forwarding when you enable the MAPI=20
Connector.  See the attached document for more details on forwarding.
NOTE: there are several SAP systems, including Apollo Production (FI) and H=
R=20
Production. You (may) have a separate set of SAP Office folders in each=20
system. Repeat the setup steps in the attachment for EACH SAP system you wa=
nt=20
to be displayed as folders in Outlook.=20
