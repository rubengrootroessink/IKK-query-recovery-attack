Group,
When doing a buy-resale with Pacificorp, we need to agree on the buy and the 
resale prices on the phone.  These prices need to be recorded in your trade 
log.  We also need to now check the prices nightly on buy-resales with 
Pacificorp when doing the SAR.  We are having numerous discrepancies with 
Pacificorp because of problems with buy-resale deal entry.  I have listened 
to several tapes where only the spread ($10 or $20 dollars) is mentioned.  
Let's be sure to  establish these prices, do the confirms nightly, and make 
sure we can continue to work closely with this counterparty. 

On a separate note...please be sure to use two tags on any buy-resales.

Thanks.

Bill
