I have scheduled a loss payback to APS of 5 mws from EPE for HE 23,24 MDT and 
HE 1-5 MT for tonight and tomorrow.  For HE 6 MDT (5 PDT) we will send APS 6 
mws.  All mws are delivered to APS at PV.  The Enpower deals are:#569111, 
569126 buy from EPE -please input price, and #569116, 569129 sell to APS at 
zero.  Prices need to be corrected for the purchase from EPE.  The deals are 
routed.  They should show up in the scrape as losses.

Thanks,
Bill
