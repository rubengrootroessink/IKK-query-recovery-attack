THANKS, BEFORE & AFTER

     I never intended to tell you anything about this, but since I became
an adult I discovered that the meaning of Thanksgiving sure isn't what it
used to be.
     When I was younger, I remember receiving the inevitable homework
assignment to write an essay on "Something I Am Thankful For".  Then, I'd
spend a lot of time sitting in my room trying to figure out just what in
the world that could possibly be, and I'd end up writing down everything I
could think of from God to environmental consciousness.
     But after having children, my priorities have clearly changed.

     Before children:  I was thankful to have been born in the United
States of America -- the most powerful, free, democracy in the world.
     After children:  I am thankful for Velcro tennis shoes.  As well as
saving valuable time, now I can hear the sound of my son taking off his
shoes which gives me three extra seconds to activate the safety locks on
the backseat windows right before he hurls them out of the car and onto the
freeway.

     Before children:  I was thankful for the recycling program that will
preserve our natural resources and prevent the overflowing of landfills.
     After children:  I am thankful for swim diapers because every time my
son wanders into water in plain disposables, he ends up wearing a blimp the
size of, say, New Jersey, on his bottom.

     Before children:  I was thankful for fresh, organic vegetables.
     After children:  I am thankful for microwavable macaroni and cheese --
without which my children would be surviving on about three bites of cereal
and their own spit.

     Before children:  I was thankful for the opportunity to obtain a
college education and have a higher quality of life than my ancestors.
     After children:  I am thankful to finish a complete thought without
being interrupted.

     Before children:  I was thankful for holistic medicine and natural herbs.
     After children:  I am thankful for any pediatric cough syrup
guaranteed to "cause drowsiness" in young children.

     Before children:  I was thankful for all of the teachers who had
taught, encouraged, and nurtured me throughout my formative years.
     After children:  I am thankful for all of the people at Weight
Watchers who let me strip down to pantyhose and a strategically placed
scarf before getting on the scale each week.

     Before children:  I was thankful for the opportunity to vacation in
exotic foreign countries so I could experience a different way of life in a
new culture.
     After children: I am thankful to have time to make it all the way down
the driveway to get the mail.

     Before children:  I was thankful for the Moosewood Vegetarian Cookbook.
     After children:  I am thankful for the Butterball turkey hotline.

     Before children:  I was thankful for a warm, cozy home to share with
my loved ones.
     After children:  I am thankful for the lock on the bathroom door.

     Before children:  I was thankful for material objects like custom
furniture, a nice car, and trendy clothes.
     After children:  I am thankful when the baby spits up and misses my
good shoes.

     Before children:  I was thankful for my wonderful family.
     After children:  I am thankful for my wonderful family.
