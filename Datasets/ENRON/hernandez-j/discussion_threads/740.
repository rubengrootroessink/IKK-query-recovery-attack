Clint,

Here is the info on BTU (City of Bryan):

Contact: Tom Hancock - Mgr, Pwr Mktg Admin - Nice guy, easy to deal with, 
talk to

Phone: 512-965-5458 - This is his mobile.  All people who trade with him call 
him on this phone
 979-821-5812 - Office

1. Tom does mostly daily/hourly type deals - mostly he will buy vs. run - 
even if the price is a little higher than his cost to run
2. BTU has extra capacity to sell, but Tom says they can't move it out 
because of contrained elements in their system
3. Typically has no problem buying from the North - he does a lot of stuff 
with Brazos

Call me if you have questions.

Zach
