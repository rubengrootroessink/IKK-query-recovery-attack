Subject: Prayer Requests for Wednesday, December 6 Bible Study


Following are the prayer requests and in case someone did not get it, the
story of the Christmas Tree.

Hope to see you all next Wednesday as we look at the Fruit of Spirit:
Peace.  Peace in the midst of storms.  Peace when there is not outward
reason for it.  Peace when it seems your world is falling apart.  That peace
that passes ALL understanding.

-- Carol

SEASON.doc>>

Dear Heavenly Father:

Thank You once again for Your Word and Your Love.  So many will be traveling
this Christmas season, we ask for that "hedge of protection" that "canopy of
Divine Love and Protection" over each of us, our families, our loved ones.

Jesus, help us to be an even brighter light for You this year.  For our
loved ones - that husband, daughter, son, brother, sister, dear friend,
wife, parent - Lord, open their eyes to see You and to see their need for
You.  Show them that they really do not have to try to make it on their own.
You so long to help them.  But they push You away.  You are so patient and
loving.  Help us to be Your Hands that reach out to them, Your arms of love
that wrap around them.  Your ears to hear what they are NOT saying.  Eyes to
see through the mask of coldness, indifference, anger, insecurity, false
bravado, or whatever has been built up around their hearts.  Send Your
laborers across their paths to show them the way to You.  Direct our words
so that we will speak words of life and hope and healing.  Let us be Your
peace in the midst of the hustle and bustle.  A calm when everyone is
running crazy.

Father, for LaShanda and her precious baby - direct their steps and hold
them close to Your heart.  For Angie Wingo and Stephanie Cole and Pat
McFarland's niece, give these women a safe and easy delivery.  Above all,
healthy babies, anointed by You and Chosen from the foundation of the earth
to be born at this time.  Keep Your hand upon them Father and give these
women Your peace.

For Juan's dear brother and Josie Wicks' job search and Mary Rios' continued
employment - Lord, You know each situation and You will be their source and
supply.  Help Juan's brother be a light at Channel 22 as he goes about his
day.

Father for LaShanda's brother, Rita Ramirez' son Jose, Eloise's brother and
mother, Anita - these are suffering from depression.  This is not from You.
You give us a spirit of love, and peace and a sound mind.  We ask for Your
peace to cover these precious ones.  For LaShanda's brother and Jose, left
this be a time that You will work amazing creative miracles in their hearts.
We are so proud of Jose and love hearing how You have lifted out of the pit
he was descending.  Do the same for LaShanda's brother.  Show he the way to
You.

There are so many who do not know You Lord.  Mary Kay's husband and sweet
daughter, Doug, Duncan, Bruce and so many others who are near and dear to
our hearts - touch these lives Lord.  Make them Your own, Father.

Lord for this situation in Melissa's family.  You know all about it.  We
lift it up to You and ask that You make a clear and open path for
forgiveness, healing, peace and remove that stress that is weighing so
heavily upon her mother.

These addictive bondages that Angie Collins' sister is trapped with - set
her free according to Your Word.  Surround her with believers who will stand
with her and encourage her and help her when she is at her weakest.

Lord, there are so many other requests that we get daily.  It can be
overwhelming - all the hurt and sorrow and pain and sickness and disease.
All those with financial burdens and marriages that are on the brink of
disaster.  Children running from all You have to give.  Lord, we ask for
Your guidance, Your strength, Your protection.  Heal the hurt, Father, and
use us.  Use us to be You in a hurting world.  Use us and continue to mold
us into Your image.  Help us to stay focused on You and not get distracted.

In Jesus' Name...Amen
