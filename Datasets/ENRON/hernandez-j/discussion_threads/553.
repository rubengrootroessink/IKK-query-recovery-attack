I must admit, yesterday I was basically told, but not in these exact words, 
how ungrateful I  was.

You see, I am one of those very fortunate people who, until a few years ago, 
had perfect 20/20 vision.
As we who are over 40 very well know, you start to lose your "good eyes" and 
must resort to eye glasses or contacts.  Well, after several years of 
fighting with the glasses, losing them, sitting on them, etc., etc., I opted 
last year for a contact lense (i.e. one -- Mono Vision).  It has been trying 
as you have to get used to focusing with one eye for reading and the other 
for distance.  

I had a conversation with my eye doctor yesterday, wanting a miracle cure, 
you know, 20/20 vision in the form of, I don't know!!, a simple pair of 
contacts?  Or, Was I a candidate for surgery?  He said that we (former 
20/20's) were the worst when it came to contacts as we had the most difficult 
time accepting our perfect vision loss.  

Immediately, I was humbled....  "Okay, okay, I hear you, I understand."  
At least I CAN see with corrective lenses, so what if it is not perfect.  

As you read below, I really am much more blessed than the many, many, many 
people of the world...

I will never complain again (well... not for a few days anyway).  

Bless and be Blessed!!!

Just a note to let you know how much and how often we think of you.  Hope 
you are having a terrific day!!

A Thanksgiving Thought:

The following is something to ponder:

If you have food in the refrigerator,
clothes on your back, a roof
overhead and a place to sleep ... you
are richer than 75% of this world.

If you have money in the bank, 
in your wallet, and spare change in a
dish someplace ... you
are among the top 8% of the world's wealthy.

If you woke up this morning with more health
than illness ... you are more blessed than
the million who will not survive this week.

If you have never experienced the danger of
battle, the loneliness of imprisonment, the
agony of torture, or the pangs of starvation...
you are ahead of 500 million people in the world.

If you can attend a church meeting without fear
of harassment, arrest, torture, or death ... you
are more blessed than three billion people in the
world.

If your parents are still alive and still married ...
you are very rare, even  in the United States.

If you hold up your head with a smile
on your face and are truly thankful ... 
you are blessed because the majority can, 
but most do not.

If you can hold someone's hand, 
hug them or even touch them on the
shoulder ... you are blessed
because you can offer healing touch.

If you can read this message, 
you just received a double blessing in
that someone was thinking of you, and furthermore,
you are more blessed than over two billion people
in the world that cannot read at all.

Have a good day, count your blessings, and pass
this along to remind everyone else how blessed we
all are.
