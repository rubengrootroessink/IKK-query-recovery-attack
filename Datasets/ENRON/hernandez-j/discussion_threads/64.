Brenna,
         This probably isn't the best time to be mentioning this, and I don't 
want you to think there is any motive behind it because reviews are currently 
in process, but I wanted to briefly talk to you about Judy Hernandez:

I think she puts in a great work performance for many reasons:

1) She is ALWAYS willing to help out when someone is backed up on projects.
2) If you ask her to help you out with something, it's completed within the 
same day or early the next day.
3) She is NEVER in a bad mood, and if she is she certainly doesn't let you 
know about it nor take out her frustrations on anyone.
4) She is very knowledgeable when it comes to questions about deals being 
acceptable or not.
5) If she can't answer your question she points you in the right direction 
for it to be answered. 

I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate working with her.  
Thanks-Eve
