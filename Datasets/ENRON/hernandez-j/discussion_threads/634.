Hello sunshine.  I haven't heard from you, I trust everything is okay.  I 
have sad news to report.  My neighbor died this morning. You remember the 
little neighbor who got burned, and no one told her that her father had lung 
cancer, well he expired.  Please pray for the family.  I feel so sorry for 
his wife.  I know I never have good news, and if you ever get tired of me 
telling you bad news just let me know.  The devil is so busy, I have to ask 
for help to fight him.  I really appreciate your willing ear. My other 
neighbor went to the emergency room Monday and they will keep her until 
today. She 
thought she was having a heart attack.  We do not know what is wrong with her 
she will go for test on next Thursday.  Help me pray for these families.  You 
know I love you.  I will talk to you later.  Tell all the Saints I said 
hello. 

Be Blessed in Jesus Name 
Kat
