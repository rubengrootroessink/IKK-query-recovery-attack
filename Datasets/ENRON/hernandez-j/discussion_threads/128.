 Subject: FW: 11 things In Life - worth reading

1. It hurts to love
someone and not be loved in
return, But what is more
painful is to love someone and
never find the courage
to let that person know
how you feel.

2.  A sad thing in life is
when you meet someone who means a
lot to you, only to find out in the end that it was
never meant to be and you just have to let go.

3. The best kind of friend
is the kind you can sit on a porch
swing with, never say a word, and then walk
away feeling like it was the best conversation
you've ever had.

4. It's true that we don't know what
we've got until we lose it, but
it's also true that we don't know what we've
been missing until it arrives.

5.  It takes only a minute
to get a crush on someone, an hour to
like someone, and a day to love someone- but it takes
a lifetime to forget someone.

6. Don't go for looks; they can deceive. Don't go
for wealth; even that fades away.
Go for someone who makes you smile because it
takes only a smile to make a dark day seem bright.

7. Dream what you want to dream; go where you want
to go; be what you want to be, because you have only
one life and one chance to do all the things you want to do.

8.  Always put yourself in the other's shoes. If you
feel that it hurts you, it probably hurts the person too.

9. A careless word may kindle strife;  a cruel word may
wreck a life; a timely word may level stress; a loving
word may heal and bless.

10. The happiest of people don't necessarily have the
best of everything they just make the most of everything that
comes along their way.

11. Love begins with a smile, grows with a kiss, ends with a tear.
When you were born, you were crying and everyone around
you was smiling.  Live your life so that when you die,
you're the one smiling and everyone around you is crying.

Send this to your friends and send it back to the person who sent
it to you.  Print this out and keep it in your pocket or purse and
pull
it out whenever you need a hint for Life. Always remember - Life
is precious, don't let it slip by.
