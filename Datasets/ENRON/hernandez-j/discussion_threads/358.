Hi,  I am trying to get an accurate number of the volume that we are faxing 
each day.  If each of you will email to me the total number of liquids and 
the total number of mdeals that you fax each day I will be able to keep a 
running total.
 
Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks!

Brenna
