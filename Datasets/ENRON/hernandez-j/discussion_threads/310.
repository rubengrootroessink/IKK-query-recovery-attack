Your order is here.    Your total is $43.56.  I am training someone today so 
look for me in my blue sweater and ponytail.  I should be somewhere in the 
area.

Thanks,
Marlo

Just to give you an update.  Avon ran short on these since they were so 
popular.  I am suppose to get it the week before Christmas.  If it comes 
earlier I will let you know.

Thanks,
Marlo
