	Remember the Magic 8 Ball from your youth? Well, in keeping with the 
tradition of the rest of our lives being digitized in Web-chunks, you can now 
have a Magic 8 Ball shaken just for you on the Web. That's right - ask it a 
question and the 8 Ball shakes itself up and reflects an answer to you via a 
Webcam. The use of the Webcam and a bunch of other techno-babble is explained 
in excrutiating detail at the site but will make your head explode if you try 
and read it. Trust me - just stick to the questions. 8ball.federated.com

	At The Coma
	The woman's husband had been slipping in and out of a coma for several 
months, yet she had stayed by his bedside every single day. One day, when he 
came to, he motioned for her to come nearer. 
	
	As she sat by him, he whispered, eyes full of tears, "You know what? You have 
been with me all through the bad times. When I got fired, you were there to 
support me. When my business failed, you were there. When I got shot, you 
were by my side. When we lost the house, you stayed right here. When my 
health started failing, you were still by my side. You know what?" 
	
	"What dear?" She gently asked, smiling as her heart began to fill with 
warmth. 
	
	"I think you're bad luck."
