	When the planets align properly, two hot topics collide together to form a 
parodist's dream. The folks at Brunching have come up with a winner in "Am I 
President or Not?" - a play on the latest trend to sweep Webdom, AmIHotOrNot, 
and the endless InjunctionFest that our Presidential Election has turned 
into. Perfect to play with while taking a break from work or to forward to 
your friends to remind them that we still don't know who will be running the 
country next month. www.brunching.com/cgi/amipresidentornot

	'Old' Is When...
	Your friends compliment you on your new alligator shoes and you're barefoot. 
	
	You don't care where your spouse goes, just as long as you don't have to go 
along. 
	
	You are cautioned to slow down by the doctor instead of by the police. 
	
	"Getting a little action" means, "I don't need to take any fiber today." 
	
	"Getting lucky" means you find your car in the parking lot. 
	
	You start saying things like, "Gee, this sebaceous cyst is killing me!" 
	
	Someone mistakes you for a sun-dried tomato while you're shopping at the 
grocery store. 
	
	An "all nighter" means not getting up to pee!
