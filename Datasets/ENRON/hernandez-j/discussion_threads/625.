> RARE FORM OF BREAST CANCER
> In November, I lost my sister to a rare kind of breast cancer.  She
> developed a rash on her breast, similar to that of young mothers who are
> nursing. Because her mammogram had been clear, the doctor treated her with
> antibiotics for infections. After 2 rounds and it continued to get worse,
> her doctor sent her for another mammogram, and this time it showed a mass.
> A biopsy found a fast growing malignancy. Chemo was started in order to
> shrink the growth; then mastectomy; then a full round of chemo; then
> radiation.  After about 9 months of intense treatment, she was given a
> clean bill of health. One year of living each day to its fullest - then it
> returned to the liver area. She took 4 treatments and decided that she
> wanted quality of life, not the after effects of chemo. We had 5 great
> months and she planned each detail of the final days.After just a few days
> of needing morphine, she slipped away saying she had done what God had
> sent her into the world to do and now it was her time to go. I still have
> tears as I write, but her message is shown below.

> Paget's Disease
> This is a rare form of breast cancer, and is on the outside of the breast,
> on the nipple and aureola. It appeared as a rash, which later became a
> lesion with a crusty outer edge. I would not have ever suspected it to be
> breast cancer but it was. My nipple never seemed any different to me,
> butthe rash bothered me, so I went to the doctor for that. Sometimes, it
> itched and was sore, but other than that it didn't bother me. It was just
> ugly and a nuisance, and could not be cleared up with all the creams
> prescribed by my doctor and dermatologist for the dermatitis on my eyes
> just prior to this outbreak. They seemed a little concerned but did not
> warn me it could be cancerous. Now I suspect there are not many women out
> there who know a lesion or rash on the nipple or aureola can be breast
> cancer. Mine started out as a single red pimple on the aureola. One of the
> biggest problems with Paget's disease of the nipple is that the symptoms
> appear to be harmless.  It is frequently thought to be a skin inflammation
> or infection, leading to unfortunate delays in detection and care.
> What are the symptoms? The symptoms include:
> 1. A persistent redness, oozing, and crusting of your nipple causing it
> to itch and burn. (As I stated, mine did not itch or burn much, and had no
> oozing I was aware of, but it did have a crust along the outer edge on one
> side).
> 2. A sore on your nipple that will not heal. (Mine was on the aureola
> area with a whitish thick looking area in center of nipple).
> 3. Usually only one nipple is affected.
>
> How is it diagnosed?
> Your doctor will do a physical exam and should suggest having a mammogram
> of both breasts, done immediately. Even though the redness, oozing and
> crusting closely resemble dermatitis (inflammation of the skin), your
> doctor should suspect cancer if the sore is only on one breast. Your
> doctor should order a biopsy of your sore to confirm what is going on.
> They will take a sample of your breast tissue in that area to test for
> cancer. If the cancer is only in the nipple and not in the breast, your
> doctor may recommend just removing the nipple and surrounding tissue or
> suggest radiation treatments. Had my doctor caught mine right away,
> instead of flaking it off as dermatitis, perhaps they could have saved my
> breast, and it wouldn't have gone to my lymph nodes.
> This message should be taken seriously and passed on to as many of your
> friends as possible; it could save someone's life. My breast cancer has
> spread and metastasized to my bones after receiving mega doses of
> chemotherapy, 28 treatments of radiation and taking tamaxofin. If this had
> been diagnosed as breast cancer in the beginning, perhaps it would not
> have spread...
> TO ALL READERS- This is sad as women are not aware of Paget's disease. If,
> by passing this around on the e-mail, we can make others aware of it, and
> its potential danger, we are helping women everywhere. Please, if you can,
> take a moment to forward this message to as many people as possible,
> especially to your family and friends. It only takes a moment, yet the
> results could save a life!
