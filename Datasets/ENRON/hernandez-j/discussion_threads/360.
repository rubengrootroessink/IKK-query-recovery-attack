Fact of the Day

 


Archie Comics fans will be happy to know that a "real-life" film version of 
"Josie and the Pussycats" is in the works and is scheduled to hit theaters in 
2001. Aging Gen X'ers may remember the 1970s Hanna-Barbera "Pussycat" series, 
on which Cheryl Ladd of "Charlie's Angels" fame provided the singing voice 
for ditsy drummer Melody Valentine. For more, click here.

Joke of the Day

 


*** Accouting for Taste 

The accountant for the law firm of Dewey, Cheatham & Howe was retiring after 
working for the firm for seventeen years. Cheatham was interviewing 
applicants, and was disappointed, as only three had even bothered to send in 
a resume.  

After looking over the application of the first, an accountant with six years 
experience at Goldman Sachs, he called the first applicant in, and asked the 
woman what 2 plus 2 was.  

She answered, "Four."  

Cheatham said he would call her if she was selected.  

The second candidate was a CPA from Harvard, and at the end of the interview 
he was asked the same question, "What is two and two?"  

The CPA replied, "Four." Cheatham told him that he would call the young man 
if he was selected.  

The third applicant was a recently-graduated philosophy. Cheatham figured 
that this wasn't going to go anywhere, but thought, "What the hey? I've got 
nothing to lose."  

He interviewed the young man quickly and asked, "I know you don't have an 
accountancy background, but can you tell me what two plus two is?"  

To which the philosophy major replied, "Can you tell me what would you want 
it to be?"  

And was hired on the spot.
