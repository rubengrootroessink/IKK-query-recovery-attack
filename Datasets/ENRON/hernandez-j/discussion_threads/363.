     THE PERFECT PICTURE
When you THINK you have a bad day, remember this one from a
young mother..."I was taking a shower when my 2-year-old son came
into the bathroom and wrapped himself in toilet paper. "Although he
made a mess, he looked adorable, so I ran for my camera and took
a few shots.  They came out so well that I had copies made and
included one with each of our Christmas cards.
Days later, a relative called about the picture,  laughing hysterically
and suggesting I take a closer look. puzzled, I stared at the photo and
was shocked to discover that in addition to my son, I had captured
my reflection in the mirror-wearing nothing but a camera!"

       MY FOOTSTEPS?
An acquaintance of mine who is a physician told this story about her
then-four-year-old daughter. On the way to preschool, the doctor had
left her stethoscope on the car seat, and her little girl picked it up
and
began playing with it. Be still, my heart, thought my friend, my daughter

wants to follow in my footsteps!
Then the child spoke into the instrument: "Welcome to McDonald's.
May I take your order?"

           WISE CHILD
A certain little girl, when asked her name, would reply, "I'm
Mr.Sugarbrown's daughter." Her mother told her this was wrong, she
must say, "I'm Jane Sugarbrown." The Vicar spoke to her in Sunday
School and said, "Aren't you Mr. Sugarbrown's daughter?"
She replied,  "I thought I was, but mother says I'm not."

        TOO ROUGH
A little girl asked her mother, "Can I go outside and play with the
boys?" Her mother replied, "No, you can't play with the boys, they're
too rough.  The little girl thought about it for a few moments, and
asked, "If I can find a smooth one, can I play with him?"

        THUMB SUCKING
A boy had reached four without giving up the habit of sucking his
thumb, though his mother had tried everything from bribery, to
reasoning to painting it with lemon juice to discourage the habit.
Finally she tried threats, warning her son that, "If you don't stop
sucking your thumb, your stomach is going to blow up like a
balloon." Later that day, walking in the park, mother and son saw
a pregnant woman sitting on a bench. The four-year-old considered
her gravely for a minute, then spoke to her saying, "Uh-oh .. I know
what you've been doing."

        THE LORD'S PRAYER
A mother was teaching her 3-year-old the Lord's prayer.  For several
evenings at bedtime she repeated it after her mother. One night she
said she was ready to solo. The mother listened with pride as she
carefully enunciated each word, right up to the end of the prayer. "Lead
us not into temptation, "she prayed, "but deliver us some e-mail, Amen."

        SO KEEP THE SINGING DOWN, OK?
A Sunday school teacher asked her little children, as they were on the
way to church service, "And why is it necessary to be quiet in church?"
One bright little girl replied, "Because people are sleeping."

         THE PRESSED LEAF
A little boy opened the big and old family Bible. With fascination, he
looked at the old pages as he turned them. Then something fell out
of the Bible and he picked up and looked at it closely. It was an old
leaf from a tree that had been pressed in between the pages. "Momma,
look what I found,"  the boy called out.  "What have you got there,
dear?"
his mother asked.  With astonishment in the young boy' voice he
answered:  "It's  Adam's suit!"
