=09=09The Onion =20
=09=09
=09=09Quick! What's the funniest site on the Web? If you said The Onion, "A=
merica's=20
Finest News Source," consider your sense of humor validated. This online=20
newspaper is the best social satire going -- no small feat in this=20
postmodern, post-satire age. Ostensibly another news site, The Onion offers=
 a=20
twisted view of current events and the typical fodder of local newspapers.=
=20
The current issue has election news -- "Vote, Voter Wasted" -- and human=20
interest -- "Neighborhood Children Gear Up for Hotly Anticipated 'Opening o=
f=20
the Gerbil's Tomb.'" The site uses friends and relations of the editors for=
=20
pictures. Good sports because usually they're posing as the incredible dwee=
bs=20
and losers populating the typical Onion news story. Be warned -- The Onion =
is=20
too funny to resist. You'll be mailing stories to friends and wasting the=
=20
boss's time if you're not careful. By the way, the Onion bills itself as "n=
ot=20
intended for readers under 18 years of age." I might ! recommend that the=
=20
easily offended or politically rigid avoid it, for the sake of cardiovascul=
ar=20
health.
