Prayer Wheel

Let's see the devil stop this one! Here's what the
wheel is all about. When you receive this, say a
prayer for the person that sent it to you....That's
all you have to do....There is nothing attached....
This is so powerful....Just send this to seven people
and watch God's answer to prayer work in your life. Do
not stop the wheel, please.... Of all the free gifts
we may receive, Prayer is the very best one..... There
are no costs, but wonderful rewards.... Let's continue
praying for one another.
Amen.

A Prayer

Father, I ask you to bless my friends reading this
right now. I am asking You to minister to their spirit
at this very moment.

Where there is pain, give them Your peace and mercy.

Where there is self doubting, release a renewed
confidence in Your ability to work through them.

Where there is tiredness, or exhaustion, I ask You to
give them understanding, patience, and strength as
they learn submission to Your leading.

Where there is spiritual stagnation, I ask You to
renew them by revealing Your nearness, and by drawing
them into greater intimacy with You.

Where there is fear, reveal Your love, and release to
them Your courage. Where there is a sin blocking them,reveal it, and
break
its hold over my friend's life.

Bless their finances, give them greater vision, and
raise up leaders, and friends to support, and
encourage them. Give each of them discernment to
recognize the evil forces around them, and reveal to
them the power they have in You to defeat it.

I ask You to do these things in Jesus' name.

In love, Your Friend

Passing this on to anyone you consider a friend will bless you both.
Passing this on to one not considered a friend is
something Christ would do.
