Subject: Update on deals

Hello Judy!

 Thanks for getting those Royal Bank deals out to me.  I checked with Melinda 
on the status of the J. Aron and Engage deals that we were still needing a 
copy of.  We looked into the J. Aron deal NE4572.1 and it was flagged as 
executed by Bob Bowen, and she was wondering if we will be requesting a copy 
of the deal from J.Aron since we don't have a copy.  She was also wondering 
if the status in TAGG will also be changed.  For the Engage deal NN3957.1 the 
status shows that is was sent to c/p June 21/00.  Jeff Sorenson said that 
there is a revision which he is currently doing, and we would need to ask him 
to send us a confirm.  There was a confirm sent to Engage Canda and a error 
letter was sent to Engage US.  Perhaps the status was never updated?  If you 
could look into this for me I would greatly appreciate it.

Thanks again Judy
