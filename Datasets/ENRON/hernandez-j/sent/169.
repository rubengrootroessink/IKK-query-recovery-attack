The Lord stood by to observe a baseball game. The Lord's team
was playing Satan's team, The Lord's team was at bat, the
score was tied zero to zero, and it was the bottom of the ninth inning
with two outs.

They continued to watch as a batter stepped up to the plate
whose name was Love. Love swung at the 1st pitch and hit a single,
because Love never fails.

The next batter was named Faith, who also got a single
because Faith works with Love.

The next batter up was named Godly Wisdom. Satan wound up
and threw the first pitch. Godly Wisdom looked it over and let it
ass.

Ball one.  Three more pitches and Godly Wisdom walked, because
Godly Wisdom never swings at what Satan throws.

The bases are loaded. The Lord then turns to Bob and told
him He was now going to bring in His star player. Up to bat
stepped Grace.

Bob said, "He sure doesn't look like much!"  Satan's whole team
relaxed when they saw Grace. Thinking he had won the game, Satan
wound up and fired his first pitch.  To the shock of everyone,
Grace hit the ball harder than anyone had ever seen.

But Satan was not worried; his center fielder let very few
get by.  He went up for the ball, but it went right through
his glove, hit him on the head and sent him crashing to the
ground; then it continued over the fence for a home run!

The Lord's team won. The Lord then asked Bob if he knew why Love,
Faith and Godly Wisdom could get on base but could not win the
game.  Bob answered that he did not know why. The Lord explained,
"If your love, faith and wisdom had won the game you would think you
had done it by yourself.  Love, faith and wisdom will get you on
base, but only MY Grace can get you home.

"My Grace is the only thing Satan cannot steal."
