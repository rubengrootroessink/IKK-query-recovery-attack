Hi everyone, a good friend sent this to me today, and
I wanted to share it with all of you.  Have a great
semester!!

Maria


 Friend



When you receive this, say a prayer.  That's all you
have to do.  There
is
nothing attached.  This is powerful.  Just send this
to four people and
do
not break this, please.  Prayer is one of the best
free gifts we
receive.
There is no cost but a lot of rewards. Let's continue
praying for one
another.

Father, I ask you to bless my friends reading this
right now Lord, show
them

a new revelation of Your love and power.  Holy Spirit,
I ask You to
minister

to their spirit at this very moment.  Where there is
pain, give them
Your
peace and Mercy.  Where there is self-doubting,
release a renewed
confidence

in Your ability to work through them.  Where there is
tiredness, or
exhaustion, I ask You to give them understanding,
patience, and
strength as
they learn submission to Your leading.  Where there is
spiritual
stagnation,

I ask You to renew them by revealing Your nearness,
and by drawing them
into

greater intimacy with You.  Where there is fear,
reveal Your love, and
release to them Your courage.  Where there is a sin
blocking them,
reveal
it, and break its hold over my friend's life.  Bless
their finances,
give
them greater vision, and raise up leaders, and friends
to support, and
encourage them.  Give each of them discernment to
recognize the demonic
forces around them, and reveal to them the power they
have in You to
defeat
it.  I ask You to do these things in Jesus' name.

In Christian love,
Your Friend in Jesus.

Passing this on to anyone you consider a friend will
bless you both.
Passing this on to one not considered a friend is
something I know
Christ
would do.
