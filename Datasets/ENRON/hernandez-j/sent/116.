>>
>>Barbara was driving her six-year-old son, Benjamin,
to his piano
lesson.
>>They were late, and Barbara was beginning to think
she should
>>have canceled it.  There was always so much to do,
and Barbara, a
>>night-duty nurse at the local hospital, had recently
worked extra
shifts.
>>She was tired.  The sleet storm and icy roads added
to her tension.
>>Maybe she should turn the car around.  "Mom!" Ben
cried. "Look!" Just
>>ahead a car had lost control on a patch of ice. As
Barbara tapped the
>>brakes, the other car spun wildly rolled over, then
crashed sideways
>>into a telephone pole.
>>Barbara pulled over skidded to a stop and threw open
her
>>door. Thank goodness she was a nurse-she might be
able to help these
>>unfortunate passengers.  Then she paused.  What
about Ben?  She
couldn't
>>take him with her. Little boys shouldn't see scenes
like the one she
>>anticipated.  But was it safe to leave him alone?
What if their car
were
>>hit
>>from behind? For a brief moment Barbara considered
going on her way.
>>Someone else was sure to come along.  No!  "Ben,
honey, promise me
>>you'll stay in the car!"
>>"I will, Mommy," he said as she ran, slipping and
sliding, toward
>>the crash site. It was worse than she'd feared.  Two
girls of high
>>school age are in the car. One, the blonde on the
passenger side, was
>>dead, killed on impact.
>>The driver, however was still breathing.  She was
unconscious and
>>pinned in the wreckage.  Barbara quickly applied
pressure to the
>>wound in the teenager's head while her practiced eye
catalogued the
other
>>injuries.  A broken leg, maybe two, along  with
probable internal
>>bleeding.
>>
>>But if help came soon, the girl would live.
>>A trucker had pulled up and was calling for help on
his cellular
phone.
>>Soon Barbara heard the ambulance sirens.
>>A few moments later she surrendered her lonely post
to rescue
workers.
>>"Good job," one said as he examined the driver's
wounds.
>>"You probably saved her life, ma'am."  Perhaps. But
as Barbara
>>walked back to her car a feeling of sadness
overwhelmed her,
especially
>>for the family of the girl who had died.  Their
lives would never be
the
>>same. Oh God, why do such things have to happen?
Slowly Barbara
opened
>>her
>>car
>>door.  What should she tell Benjamin?  He was
staring at the crash
>>site, his blue eyes huge.   "Mom," he whispered,
"did you see it?"
>>" See what,  Honey?" she asked.  "The angel, Mom!
He came down from
>>the sky while you were running to the car.
>>And he opened the door, and he took that girl out."
>>
>>Barbara's eyes filled with tears. "Which door, Ben?"
>>"The passenger side. He took the girl's hand, and
they floated
>>up to Heaven together."
>>"What about the driver?"
>>Ben shrugged. "I didn't see anyone else."
>>Later Barbara was able to meet the families of the
victims.
>>They expressed their gratitude for the help she had
provided.
Barbara
>>was able to give them something more - Ben's vision.
 There was no
way he
>>could have known-by ordinary means-who was in the
car or what had
>>happened to either of the passengers. Nor could the
passenger door
have
>>been opened; Barbara had seen it's tangle of
immovable steel
herself.
>>Yet
>>Ben's account brought consolation to a grieving
family.
>>Their daughter was safe in Heaven.  And they would
see her again.
>>
>>          A Prayer For Angels
>>          I prayed for Angels to guard you night and
day.
>>          I prayed they would hover and keep harm
away.
>>          If you hear the swish of wings or feel a
gentle touch.
>>          I know God heard my prayer today and loves
you very much.
>>
>>Send this to all your friends and the person who
sent it to you.
>>
>>If  you get it back- you know you have a friend for
life!!!
