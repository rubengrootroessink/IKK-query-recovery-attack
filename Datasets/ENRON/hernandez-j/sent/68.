This is a very good person to know.

Today I met  a great new friend
Who knew me right away 
It was funny how she understood 
All I had to say 

She listened  to my problems
She listened to my dreams 
We talked about love and life 
She'd been there, too, it seems 

 I never once  felt judged by her
She knew just how I felt 
She seemed to just accept me 
And all the problems I'd been dealt 

She didn't  interrupt me
Or need to have her say 
She just listened very patiently 
And didn't go away 

I wanted her  to understand
How much this meant to me 
But as I went to hug her 
Something startled me 

I put my arms  in front of me
And went to pull her nearer 
And realized that my new best friend 
Was nothing but a mirror.

True Friends are hard to come by. Your  first true friend should be yourself. 
Enjoy this poem about friendship  & pass it on to your friends.
