FRCC

 For the evening peak prices remained strong.  TLR's prevented any movement 
of power into Florida during the evening peak.  TVA was the culprit in 
calling for TLR's.  TLR's were not called off until He  22.  For He 23 and He 
24 we sold 100mw's  to FPL at $41 and $36.  For HE 1 they bought directly 
from their neighbors at $18.  FPC, JEA and TECO were flat for these hours.  
For hours 2-6 FPL was a  $15 bid.  Due to limited hourly trans. available and 
the likelihood of TLR's a short schedule sale to Florida was not possible.    
 


SERC

TLR's were still in place for the evening peak thus limiting the import of 
power into SERC from the North.  The eveving peak saw all of SOCO interfaces 
showing -0-.  Starting HE 23  the EES side of SOCO opened up with 150 mw's.  
We were able to move Cajn power into Florida staring HE 23.  We offered SOCO 
$45 for this hour and they passed on it.  Off-peak offers were in the low 
20's.  SOCO was a $16 bid.  No one would show a decent  bid for a 16-hr 
preschedule.  The guys on shift would not show a bid or offer for a 16-hr 
preschedule.  They will wait until the afternoon to start buying.  Most of 
the night guys in SERC believe that TLR's will once again be called by TVA 
starting in the afternoon.
