      ON A POSITIVE NOTE:
      On a positive note I've learned that no matter what happens,
or how bad
      it
      seems today,
      life does go on, and it will be better  tomorrow.  I've
learned that you
      can
      tell a
      lot about a person by the way he/she handles these three
things: a rainy

      day, lost
      luggage, and tangled Christmas tree lights. I've learned
that regardless
      of
      your
            relationship with your parents, you'll miss
them when they're gone from your life.
            I've learned that making a "living" is not
the same thing as making a "life."
            I've learned that life sometimes gives you a
second chance. I've learned
      that you
      shouldn't go through life with a catcher's mitt on both
hands. You need
      to
      be able to
            throw something back.  I've learned that if
you pursue happiness, it will elude you.
            But if you focus on your family, your
friends, the needs of others, your
      work and doing
      the very best you can, happiness will find you. I've learned
that
      whenever I
      decide
      something with an open heart, I usually make the right
decision. I've
      learned that even
      when I have pains, I don't have to be one.  I've learned
that every day
      you
      should
      reach out and touch someone.  People love that human touch,
holding
      hands, a
      warm hug,
            or just a friendly pat on the back. I've
learned that I still have a lot to learn.
      I've learned that you should pass this on to someone you
care about. I
      just
      did. Sometimes
      they just need a little something to make them smile.


            Note: people will forget what you said,
people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made
them feel.
