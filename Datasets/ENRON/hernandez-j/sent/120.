I have attached the last Inclement Weather plan updated by our team.  Please 
review your specific area and update as needed.  If your area is not 
reflected, such as Rates or Information and Records Management, please 
develop a plan.  Be sure to check with your primary customers as to their 
expectations and needs for each of these scenarios to ensure you are planning 
appropriate action/coverage.  I would prefer to have this updated by 6/30 to 
be ready for the long July 4th holiday.  

Please coordinate your updates with Marvia.
