ECAR
  
Prices for the evening peak were offered out in the high teens to low 
twenties.  Bids were in the low teens.  TLR's were called thus preventing 
power from moving down to the south.  Off-peak prices were just as ugly with 
offers in the mid teens and no one showing a bid.  PJM called for min. gen. 
for a couple of hours.  After he 23 LGEE began sending 365 mw's to TVA.  This 
was the only movement of power in Ecar per Oasis.  For Tuesday everyone will 
have hourly power to sell.  FE will have 200-300 mw's to move each hour.  No 
one had much interest in picking up a pre-schedule for Tuesday. 



MAIN

Prices in Main were a little lower than in Ecar.  Bids for the evening peak 
were in the low teens and for off peak bids were in the single digit's.  CE, 
Ameren, IP and Wepco will have hourly power to sell.  ALT bought 150 mw's on 
a preschedule for Tuesday.  They bought this preschedule from their neighbors 
in the low 20's.  They will be looking to pick up another 50 mw's beginning 
he 9.  They will be looking to pay in the low 20's again.  This was the only 
bid for a preschedule in Main.
