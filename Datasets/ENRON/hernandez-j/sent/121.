                 To: YOU
               Date: TODAY
               From: THE BOSS
            Subject: YOURSELF
          Reference: LIFE


I am God.
Today I will be handling all of your problems.
Please remember that I do not need your help.
If life happens to deliver a situation to you that you cannot handle, do not
attempt to resolve it.  Kindly put it in the SFGTD (something for God to do)
box.
It will be addressed in My time, not yours.  Once the matter is placed into
the box, do not hold on to it.
If you find yourself stuck in traffic; don't despair. There are people in
this world for whom driving is an unheard of privilege.
Should you have a bad day at work;
Think of the man who has been out of work for years.
Should you despair over a relationship gone bad; Think of the person who has
never known what it's like to love and be loved in return.
Should you grieve the passing of another weekend; Think of the woman in dire
straits, working twelve hours a day, seven days a week to feed her children.
Should your car break down, leaving you miles away from assistance; Think of
the paraplegic who would love the opportunity to take that walk.
Should you notice a new gray hair in the mirror; Think of the cancer patient
in chemo who wishes she had hair to examine.
Should you find yourself at a loss and pondering what is life all about,
asking what is my purpose?
Be thankful. There are those who didn't live long enough to get the
opportunity.
Should you find yourself the victim of other people's bitterness, ignorance,
smallness or insecurities;
Remember, things could be worse.
You could be them!!!!
Let it go so God can do His job.
