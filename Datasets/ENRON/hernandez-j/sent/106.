You guys don't have to send this back to me because I know some of you don't 
have time, but I know you will ask the Lord to bless me anyway.  I am sending 
this to you because I think it is a nice prayer.  Let's keep each other in 
our prayers.

Love ya,
gina

?? MORNING BLESSING
    I asked the Lord to bless you,
    As I prayed for you today.
??  To guide you and protect you,
    As you go along your way.
    His love is always with you,
    His promises are true,
    And when we give Him all our cares,
 ?? We know He'll see us through.
    So when the road you're traveling on
  ? Seems difficult at best,
    Just remember I'm here praying
    And God will do the rest.



 Forward this to at least 10 people whom you want God to bless and,
 don't forget to send it back to the one who asked God to bless you
 first.
