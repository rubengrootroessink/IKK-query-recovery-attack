Juan,
Looking at my schedule, I could take off my days on Saturday the 21st and 
Sunday the 22nd and work days on Thurs & Fri the 26 & 27.  I can't take 
Monday the 23rd because there are only two of us on that night.  I would be 
very happy to make this change.  Please let me know ASAP if this is 
acceptable so I can make the appropriate plans.

Doug
