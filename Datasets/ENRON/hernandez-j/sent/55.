>   Just for the morning, I am going to smile
>   when I see your face
>   and laugh when I feel like crying.
>
>   Just for this morning, I will let you
>   choose what you want to wear,
>   and smile and say how perfect it is.
>
>   Just for this morning, I am going to step
>   over the laundry, and pick you up
>   and take you to the park to play.
>
>   Just for this morning, I will leave the
>   dishes in the sink, and let you
>   teach me how to put that puzzle of yours together.
>
>   Just for this afternoon, I will unplug the
>   telephone and keep the computer off,
>   and sit with you in the backyard and
>   blow bubbles.
>
>   Just for this afternoon, I will not yell
>   once, not even a tiny grumble when you scream
>   and whine for the ice cream truck, and I will buy
>   you one if he comes by.
>
>   Just for this afternoon, I won't worry
>   about what you are going to
>   be when you grow up, or second guess every decision
>   I have made where you are concerned.
>
>   Just for this afternoon, I will let you
>   help me bake cookies, and I won't
>   stand over you trying to fix them.
>
>   Just for this afternoon, I will take us to
>   Mc Donald's and buy us both a
>   Happy Meal so you can have both toys.
>
>   Just for this evening, I will hold you in
>   my arms and tell you a story about
>   how you were born and how much I love you.
>
>   Just for this evening, I will let you
>   splash in the tub and not get angry.
>
>   Just for this evening, I will let you stay
>   up late while we sit on the porch
>   and count all the stars.
>
>   Just for this evening, I will snuggle
>   beside you for hours, and miss
>   my favorite TV shows.
>
>   Just for this evening when I run my finger
>   through your hair as you pray,
>   I will simply be grateful that God has
>   given me the greatest gift
>   ever given.
>
>   I will think about the mothers and fathers who are
>   searching for their missing children,
>   the mothers and fathers who are visiting their
>   children's graves instead of their bedrooms,
>   and mothers and fathers who are in
>   hospital rooms watching their children suffer senselessly,
>   and screaming inside they can't handle it anymore.
>
>   And when I kiss you goodnight I will hold
>   you a little tighter, a little longer. It is then,
>   that I will thank God for you, and ask him for
>   nothing, except one more day.............
>
>   Please pass this on to other mothers and fathers.  I
>   think that we get too involved in our daily routines that we tend
>   to forget what great gifts our children really are.
