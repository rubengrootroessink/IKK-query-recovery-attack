Subject: Enron Field/Houston Astros Tickets Announcement

As many of you know, the opening of Enron Field is quickly approaching.  
Enron Field, the new 42,000 seat retractable roof ballpark, will make its 
debut when the Astros play host to the World Champion New York Yankees on 
March 30th and 31st.  The defending American League West Champion Texas 
Rangers travel to Houston on April 1st.  The Astros open the 2000 
Championship Season on the road before playing host to the Philadelphia 
Phillies in the season opener on April 7th.

There have been numerous inquiries about how to secure tickets for Astros 
games at Enron Field.  A limited number of tickets have been allocated for 
Enron for these inaugural games.  However, we anticipate that the demand for 
tickets by employees will exceed this allocation.  In an effort to keep all 
of you informed, Astros tickets will be going on sale for the entire season 
to the general public for single-game tickets beginning this Saturday, 
January 29th at 9:00 a.m.  

 We recommend you secure personal tickets for the games of your choice 
through the traditional Astros ticket outlets listed below.  Enron will sell 
a significant portion of its allotted tickets to employees in late February; 
however, please remember that our supply of tickets is limited and will sell 
out quickly.

 March 30 vs. New York Yankees (Inaugural exhibition game)
 March 31 vs. New York Yankees
 April 1 vs. Texas Rangers
 April 7 vs. Philadelphia Phillies (Opening Day)

ADVANCED TICKET PURCHASES:
Tickets for all 84 home games, including three exhibition games, will be 
available at the Astrodome Box Office and the usual Ticketmaster outlets, 
including Houston-area Foley's, Fiesta and Kroger stores.  Those who wish to 
order by phone may do so by calling (713) 6-ASTROS.  Tickets are also 
accessible on-line at  www.astros.com and www.ticketmaster.com.

A detailed follow up e-mail will be sent to provide more information on when 
and where the Enron tickets will be sold.  In addition, Astros tickets will 
be available to Enron employees throughout the season, and we will notify you 
of these opportunities.
