First Lady Hillary Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno were
> having one of those girl to girl talks.
>
> Hillary says to Janet, "You're lucky that you don't have to put up
> with men having sex with you. I have to put up with Bill, and
> there's no telling where he last had his pecker."
>
> Janet responded. "Just because I am considered ugly, doesn't
> mean I don't have to fight off unwelcome sexual advances."
>
> Hillary asks, "Well how do you deal with the problem?"
>
> Janet says, "Whenever I feel that a guy is getting ready to make
> a pass at me, I muster all my might and squeeze out the loudest,
> nastiest, fart I can."
>
> Well, that night, Bill was already in bed with the lights out when
> Hillary headed for bed. She could hear him start to stir, and
> knew that he would be wanting some action. She had been
> saving her farts all day, and was ready for him. She tenses up
> her butt cheeks and forces out the most disgusting sounding
> fart you could imagine.
>
> Bill rolls over and says, "Is that you, Janet?"

regretfully upon the closed door that we do not see the one which has opened 
for us."                             -- Alexander Graham Bell
