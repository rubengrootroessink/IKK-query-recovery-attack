Subject: hourly checkout AECI HE 9 from 5-3-01

Kurt at AECI showed AECI purchasing 96 mws at $38 for HE 9.  The P&L showed 
this deal at $40.  I offered to meet in the middle at $39.  Kurt preferred to 
pull the tapes and review the deal with his day guy that did the deal.  This 
is a heads up on the situation.
