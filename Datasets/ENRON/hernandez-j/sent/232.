TLR's were again the story in SERC.  TLR's were not lifted until 1:00 a.m.  
We could not move anything from ECAR into SERC.  This was not the case for 
the AEP marketers, TVA trans. made a mistake by allowing a new schedule to be 
started with an AEP to SOCO sink.  TVA admitted this mistake to us.   OPC and 
SOCO were the strongest bid across the evening peak.  OPC was an $80 bid for 
he 20.  SOCO was a $60 bid across the evening peak.  SCEG was the only other 
bid during the evenng peak and he was trying to buy under his gas units.  
VEPCO was a $50 offer, unfortunately, VEPCO was a bad source for SOCO and 
OPC.  For off-peak OPC was the strongest bid for he23 and 24.  We sold them 
$24 for he 24.  We also sold $15.50's to SOCO  for he 2-6.   CPL was the only 
 offer at $19.50.  SOCO had no offer for off-peak, they had to much 
maintenance to offer anything out.  For Thursday  SOCO, OPC and SCEG will 
again be buying hourly after the morning peak.  DUKE, CPL and VEPCO will have 
hourly to sell tomorrow.    

 SERC    16 hour average:  BID  $ 43.9  OFFER $ 60.2

After the preschedule we sold FPC through he 19,  FPC was a $50 bid.   FPL 
would not show a bid for he 20.  FPL was a $70 offer beginning he 21.  FPL 
was the only offer for across the evening peak.  FPL showed $140 for he 20.  
FPL began  selling $60-$70 to SOCO for he 21-22.  Off-peak was the same as 
yesterday with bids in the mid teens,  there was no real interest in buying 
off-peak.   FPC and FP&L  will again be on the bid for b.o.d. schedules.
