Reason, Season and Lifetime


People come into your life for a reason, a season, or a lifetime.
When you figure out which it is, you know exactly what to do.
When someone is in your life for a REASON, it is usually to
meet a need you have expressed outwardly or inwardly.
They have come to assist you through a difficulty, to provide you
with guidance and support, to aid you physically, emotionally, or
spiritually.
They may seem like a godsend, and they are.
They are there for the reason you need them to be.
Then, without any wrong doing on your part or at an inconvenient time, this
person willsay or do something to bring the relationship to an end.
Sometimes they die. Sometimes they walk away.
Sometimes they act up or out and force you to take a stand.
What we must realize is that our need has been  met, our desire fulfilled;
their work is done.
The prayer you sent up has been answered and it is now time to move on.

When people come into your life for a SEASON, it is because
 your turn has come to share, grow, or learn.
They may bring you an experience of  peace or make you laugh.
They may teach you something you have never done.
They usually give you an unbelievable amount of joy. Believe it!
It is real!  But, only for a season.

LIFETIME relationships teach you lifetime lessons; those things
you must build upon in order to have a solid emotional foundation.
Your job is to accept the lesson, love the person/people (anyway); and put
what  you have learned to use in all other relationships and areas of your
life.
It is said that love is blind but friendship is clairvoyant.

Thank you for being a part of my life... Smile and stop here if you're not
into this final part: This is to show people you love them and to see how
many people love you!!
Don't feel embarrassed cause only you will get the results. Send it to every
friend
that you have online, including the person who sent it to you.

0 Replies = you may need to work on your people skills
2 Replies = you are nice but probably need to be more outgoing.
4 Replies = you have picked your friends well
6 Replies = you are downright popular
8 Replies or More = you are totally awesome (and probably know why you're on
MY list)!

When you receive this e-mail just recite the following prayer.
That's all you have to do. There is nothing attached. This is the power of
prayer
at work. Just send this to (4) people and see what happens on the fourth
day.
Do not break this, please. There is no cost, but lots of rewards.

PRAYER:
May today there be peace within you. May you trust God that you are exactly
where you are meant to be. May you not forget the infinite possibilities
that are born of faith. May you use those gifts that you have
received, and pass on the love that has been given to you. May you be
content
knowing that you are a child of God. Let His presence settle into your
bones, and allow your soul the freedom to sing, dance, and to bask in the
sun.
It is there for each and every one of you.

Send this to (4) or more people and witness the awesome power
of prayer.

God Bless.
