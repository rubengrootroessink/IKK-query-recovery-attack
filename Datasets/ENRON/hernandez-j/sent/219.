Always thinking of my dear friends!

> I said a prayer for you just now.......
> When you receive this e-mail just recite the following prayer. That's all
> you have to do. There is nothing attached. This is the power of prayer at
> work.  Just send this to (4) people and see what happens on the fourth
> day.
> Do not break this, please. There is no cost, but lots of rewards. Let's
> continue to pray for one another.
> PRAYER:
> May today there be peace within you. May you trust God that you are
> exactly
> where you are meant to be. May you not forget the infinite possibilities
> that are born of faith. May you use those gifts that you have received,
> and
> pass on the love that has been given to you. May you be content knowing
> that
> you are a child of God. Let His presence settle into your bones, and allow
> your soul the freedom to sing, dance, and to bask in the sun. It is there
> for each and every one of you.
> Send this to (4) or more people and witness the awesome power of prayer.
