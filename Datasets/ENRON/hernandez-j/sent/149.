Subject: March Surveys

Hello,

We have prepared January and February data and will be scheduling meetings 
with you in the next few weeks.  For the month of March, please provide a 
completed "Hours" survey for each position within your group.  This survey 
will collect the  time your team spent on performing their activities in the 
month of March.   

NOTE: We are now collecting EOL related activities.  If you spend time 
directly supporting EOL, and your survey does not have an activity that you 
can assign these times to, please contact me as soon as possible so we can 
add the appropriate activities to your survey.

To fill out the survey:

At the top of the spreadsheet, you will see a box labelled "Select Your RC".  
Click on the box and input your RC number, which will need to be 4 digits.
Once you have done this, another box will appear with the message "Select 
Position from Drop Box!" You can then select the position (i.e., staff, 
specialist, etc.) and "OK". The choices for positions are based on 
information contained in the Org Database (i.e., if a position is not listed 
that should be, please call me to discuss as it would indicate that 
corrections need to be made to the database).  Once you have the list of 
activities, please input hours (for the entire month) for each activity 
listed in the column labelled "Hours".
If you're filling out the survey for your team, save a file for each of the 
positions you fill out for your team prior to filling out the next position.  
If you do not, the information will be lost.

We have included February compiled hours per position (if you had two 
specialists performing the same activity - 20 hours each, the "Last Month" 
column would show a total of 40 hrs for that month).  As with last month, you 
have the option to complete the survey on behalf of your entire group or send 
this survey to each of your team members, allowing each individual to fill 
out the time they spent on each activity.  If there are any activities you 
perform not included in your survey, please contact me as soon as possible 
for a copy of the Activity Dictionary.

Please return these surveys by end of day Wednesday, April 5th.  If this is a 
problem, please notify me or Lisa Cousino immediately.

Thanks,
Shari
