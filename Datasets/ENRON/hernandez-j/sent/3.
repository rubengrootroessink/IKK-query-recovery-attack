The man whispered, "God speak to me" and a meadowlark sang. But the man
did not hear. 

So the man yelled "God speak to me" And the thunder rolled across the sky.
But the man did not listen. 

The man looked around and said, "God let me see you." And a star shined
brightly, but the man did not notice. 

And the man shouted, "God show me a miracle" And a life was born.  But
the man did not know. 

So the man cried out in despair, "Touch me God, and let me know you are
here" Whereupon, God reached down and touched the man. But the man brushed
the butterfly away and walked on. 

Don't miss out on a blessing because it isn't packaged the way that you
expect.  So many times we see miracles and do not recognize them for what
they are. 

My instructions were to send this to four or more people that I wanted God
to bless and I picked you. Please pass this to people you want to be
blessed.
