> >> From a woman who works in a police department:
> >>
> >>
> >>    I have to share some things I have learned in my job
> >>    with you.
> >>
> >>    In my job, I review criminal and psychiatric files of
> >>    imprisoned sex offenders who are approaching their
> >>    release date.  I decide if they are likely to re-offend
> >>    based on certain criteria and then civilly commit them
> >>    to a sex offender treatment facility if I decide that
> >>    they are at significant risk to re-offend
> >>
> >>    I have read hundreds and hundreds of files, and have
> >>    taken note of some of the mistakes women make.  Let me
> >>    preface this by saying that a woman is NEVER EVER EVER
> >>    at fault for being raped or attacked, but there are
> >>    definitely ways to reduce your risk of being a victim.
> >>
> >>    Here are the most common mistakes women make that
> >>    could result in them getting kidnapped, attacked,
> >>    and/or raped:
> >>
> >>    1.  Getting into the attacker's car when he pulls a
> >>    gun and orders you to get into his vehicle.
> >>
> >>    Most attackers don't want to shoot you ... they want
> >>    you to get into the car so that they can drive you to
> >>    a deserted place and torture you.  Don't comply.  Run
> >>    screaming.  It is MUCH more likely than not that he
> >>    will just move on to an easier target.
> >>
> >>    2.  Pulling over when a man drives alongside of you
> >>    pointing at your car pretending something is wrong.
> >>
> >>    If this happens, drive to the nearest well-lit and
> >>    populated gas station and look the car over yourself
> >>    (or ask an attendant).  Never pull over.  Believe it
> >>    or not, many women have fallen for this for fear of
> >>    their car spontaneously exploding in the middle of the
> >>    road.  Not likely.
> >>
> >>    3.  Not locking your doors while driving.
> >>
> >>    I have read several cases where the attacker simply
> >>    walks up to a woman's car while she's at a traffic
> >>    light and jumps in with his gun or knife drawn.
> >>
> >>    4.  Opening your front door when you have not
> >>    positively identified who is there.
> >>
> >>    If you don't have a peep hole, get one.  I've seen
> >>    countless cases where the attacker gains access to his
> >>    victims simply by knocking on their door.
> >>
> >>    Don't let an attacker get into your home.  He then has
> >>    a private, relatively soundproof place to attack you.
> >>
> >>    5.  Not being alert in parking lots.
> >>
> >>    If you go to the grocery store at night, don't be shy
> >>    about asking for an escort to your car.  Too many
> >>    women are abducted from parking lots or even raped in
> >>    the parking lot.
> >>
> >>    Look in your back seat before entering your car.  Cars
> >>    provide endless hiding places for attackers, both
> >>    inside them and in between them.
> >>
> >>    Be aware of your surroundings by looking to the left
> >>    and right and behind you with your head up all the
> >>    time.  You may appear paranoid and look funny to
> >>    others, but an attacker will think twice about
> >>    approaching someone who appears so aware of what's
> >>    going on.
> >>
> >>    6.  Trusting a clean cut, honest looking stranger.
> >>
> >>    I see mug shots of every sex offender in the state of
> >>    Florida.  They do not look like monsters.  They often
> >>    look like they could be your friendly grocer, bank
> >>    teller, waiter, neighbor, clergy, doctor, etc.  They
> >>    are every age between 15 and 90, and probably beyond.
> >>    Only a small minority actually look scary.
> >>
> >>    I just read a case yesterday of a man with only one
> >>    leg who beat up his victim with his crutch before he
> >>    raped her.  Who would have ever thought that a
> >>    one-legged man could be a rapist?
> >>
> >> 7.  Trusting people to be alone with your children.
> >>
> >> This is a difficult one, because child molesters end
> >> up being the LAST person the parents would believe is
> >> the molester.
> >>
> >> Most of the child molesting cases I see involve the
> >> stepfather, the uncle, the sister's boyfriend, the
> >> mother's boyfriend, the grandfather, the baby-sitter,
> >> the neighbor, the family friend, the youth camp
> >> director, day care worker, etc.  Although rare, even
> >> women can be molesters.
> >>
> >> In every case, the perpetrator is a nice guy,
> >> trusting, good with children, and the family is
> >> baffled or even in disbelief that the person could be
> >> abusing their child.
> >>
> >> When it comes to your children and grandchildren, be
> >> suspicious of everyone, no matter who they are.  And
> >> pay attention to what your child says and how he/she
> >> reacts to the mention of different people in their
> >> lives.
> >>
> >> I didn't mean to make anyone uncomfortable with this,
> >> but I am at work right now reviewing files, and
> >> realized that this email is a way I can reach many
> >> women at one time.  I have the dirty job of reading
> >> all these files, and it makes me feel good to know
> >> that I can share some inferences from what I have
> >> learned.  This is not an exhaustive list of what not
> >> to do, but just some things that I have observed more
> >> than just a few times.
> >>
> >> Pass this on to the women in your lives
