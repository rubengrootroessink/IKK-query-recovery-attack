>THE HAND
>--------------------------------
>My daughter, Kathleen, was 15... too young to seriously date but she had
>a boyfriend. One evening, when I was leaving to pick up my son, Paul,
>from baseball practice, she asked if she could just go with her
>boyfriend to pick up his little brother at a friend's house. She said
>they would come right back.
>I said, "All right, just make sure you wear your seat belt, and come
>right home." It was my father's birthday and my youngest
>daughter,Therese, was already at my father's house waiting for us to
>come over with the cake I had yet to pick up at the store. I left to
>pick Paul up at school, but decided to take the highway, rather than the
>shortcut along the back roads.
>After leaving the school, Paul and I ran in the store for the cake and
>some last minute goodies. As we were getting into the car, we heard and
>saw paramedics, fire trucks, three ambulances and of course a multitude
>of police cars. ? I got a sick feeling in my stomach and said to Paul,
>"Somebody needs our prayers, quick." ? I wondered if there was a fire
>or a bad car accident.
>At one of the intersections I had to stop to let more emergency vehicles
>through, and prayed, "Lord, those people need you right now, go to them
>and place your protective hand over them."
>We stopped at my parents to drop off the food, before going home to pick
>up Kathleen, but my father met me at the car and told us to postpone the
>Party because Therese had fallen asleep.
>"Which way did you go to the school?" he asked, "Because there was a bad
>accident on the back road, I heard someone was killed. It happened just
>about the time you had to pick up Paul at the school and I know you
>always go that way. I was so happy to see you pull in, I had a gut
>feeling it was you."
>As Paul and I drove the short distance home, I could see our house was
>dark and when Kathleen is home alone, she always burned every light. As
>I turned off the ignition, tears fell, "It was Kathleen," I told Paul,
>"I know it." I ran in the house and checked our answering machine, no
>one
>had called. I breathed a sigh of relief, thinking that someone would
>have called by now. "Paranoid," that's what Kathleen always called me,
>and that's what I was telling myself, "You're just paranoid!" Then, the
>phone rang. It was her friend's mother, who worked in the emergency room
>of our local hospital. She only told me that the three of them were in
>an accident and were being transported to the hospital.
>I didn't call my husband at work, or my parents. Paul and I just left
>for the hospital. As I pulled into the parking lot, one of the
>paramedics, someone we have known for years met us at our car.
>"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry," he said with tears streaming down his face.
>????The next thing I remember after was talking to the doctor in
>the hallway of the ER.
>He asked me if I believed in God, and with that my knees gave way.
>"No," he said, "you don't understand, do you believe in divine
>intervention? "I stammered, a weak, "Yes." ? Not having a clue what he
>was talking about. ? He smiled at me and asked, "Do you know what
>shirt your daughter was wearing, tonight?" Nodding no, he told me to go
>down the hall and look. "Your daughter is blessed with angels and so are
>you.
>From what the emergency personnel told me, there is no way that your
>daughter should be alive, let alone only have a few scratches." Kathleen
>was laying on a cart, waiting for more x-rays. When I got to her, we
>both sobbed. As I was hugging her I had the urge to check her shirt,
>unzipping her jacket. I read the words, "Jesus Saves." I knew then, what
>the doctor had meant.
>All three were treated and released. On the way home that night,
>Kathleen told this story: "It was really weird, about a quarter of a
>mile before the accident, I said, 'Wait, we forgot to put our seatbelts
>on, my Mother will kill me.' Then a car was coming towards us in our
>lane, he swerved, and I knew we got hit on the passenger side of the
>car, where I was sitting. We got hit a total of three times because the
>car kept spinning in a circle. I felt his little brother's hand on my
>shoulder, holding me lightly in place.
>"But Mom, after it was all over, I could still feel the hand on my
>shoulder. I looked and his little brother had flown out the back window
>of the car, as we later found out, on the first spin. "It was an
>angel,Mom,I know it!"
>I knew it too, especially when we went the next day to look at the car,
>it had been split in half, right underneath my daughter's seat. The
>driver of the other car, witnesses said, was traveling 90-95 miles Per
>hour and the point of impact at that speed was directly at Kathleen's
>door. The police report stated that the car door was found fifty feet
>away from the accident scene, with the seat belt attached. So when the
>door broke loose, "the hand" was the only thing that saved my daughter's
>life.
>The Lord, knew, long before I did that my child was in trouble, and I
>will always praise Him for saving her life and restoring mine. I have
>been meaning to write this story for the past couple years. ? Kathleen
>just turned 21. While I was writing this I smiled and cried, it's all
>true.
>
>
>
>Father, I ask you to bless my friend reading this right now!
>
>Lord, show them a new revelation of Your love and power.
>
>Holy Spirit, I ask You to minister to their spirit at this very moment.
>
>Where there is pain, give them Your peace & mercy.
>
>Where there is self-doubting, release a renewed confidence in Your
>ability to work through them.
>
>Where there is tiredness, or exhaustion, I ask You to give them
>understanding, patience, & strength as they learn submission to Your
>leading.
>
>Where there is spiritual stagnation, I ask You to renew them by
>revealing Your nearness, and by drawing them into greater intimacy with
>You.
>
>Where there is fear, reveal Your love, and release to them Your courage.
>
>Where there is a sin blocking them, reveal it, and break its hold over
>my friend's life.
>
>Bless their finances, give them greater vision, and raise up leaders,
>and friends to support, and encourage them.
>
>Give each of them discernment to recognize the demonic forces around
>them, and reveal to them the power they have in You to defeat it.
>
>I ask You to do these things in Jesus'name!
>In Christian love,
>Your Friend in Jesus
>
>
>Passing this on to anyone you consider a friend, as I have done here,
>will bless you both. Passing this on to one not considered a friend is
>something I know Christ would do.
