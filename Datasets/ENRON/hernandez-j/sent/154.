Like any good mother, when Karen found out that another baby was on the way,
she
did what she could o help her 3-year-old son, Michael, prepare for a new
sibling. They found out that the new baby was going to be a girl, and day
after
day, night after
night, Michael sang to his sister in Mommy's tummy. He was building a bond
of
love with his little sister before he even met her.  The pregnancy
progressed
normally for Karen of Morristown, Tennessee. In time, the labor pains came.
Soon
it was every five minutes, every three ...every  minute.  But serious
complications arose during delivery and Karen found herself in hours of
labor.
Would a C-section be required?  Finally, after a long struggle, Michael's
little
sister was born. But she was in very serious condition.  With a siren
howling in
the night, the ambulance rushed the infant to the neonatal intensive care
unit
at St. Mary's Hospital, Knoxville, Tennessee.

The days inched by. The little girl got worse. The pediatrician had to tell
the
parents,  "There is very little hope. Be prepared for the worst." Karen and
her
husband contacted a local cemetery about a burial plot. They had fixed up a
special room in their house for their new baby but now they found themselves
having to plan for a funeral. Michael, however, kept begging his parents to
let
him see his sister. "I want to sing to her," he kept saying.  Week two in
intensive care looked as if a funeral would come before the week was over.
Michael kept nagging about singing to his sister, but kids are never allowed
in
Intensive Care.

Karen made up her mind, though. She would take Michael whether they liked it
or
not! If he didn't see his sister right then, he may never see her alive.
She
dressed him in an oversized scrub suit and marched him into ICU.  He looked
like
a walking laundry basket. But the head nurse recognized him as a child and
bellowed, "Get that kid out of here now! No children are allowed."
The mother rose up strong in Karen, and the usually mild-mannered lady
glared
steel-eyed right into the head nurse's face, her lips a firm line.
"He is not leaving until he sings to his sister!"
Karen towed Michael to his sister's bedside. He gazed at the tiny infant
losing
the battle to live.  After a moment, he began to sing. In the pure-hearted
voice
of a 3-year-old, Michael sang: "You are my sunshine, my only sunshine, you
make
me happy when skies are gray >>---"
>>Instantly the baby girl seemed to respond. The pulse rate began to calm
down
and become steady. "Keep on singing, Michael," encouraged Karen with tears
in
her eyes.
"You never know, dear, how much I love you, Please don't take my sunshine
away-"
As Michael sang to his sister, the baby's ragged, strained breathing became
as
smooth as a kitten's purr. "Keep on singing, Sweetheart!" "The other night,
dear, as I lay
sleeping, I dreamed I held you in my arms..."
>>Michael's little sister began to relax as rest, healing rest,seemed to
sweep
over her.  "Keep on singing, Michael."  Tears had now conquered the face of
the
bossy head nurse. Karen glowed. "You are my sunshine, my only Sunshine.
Please
don't, take my sunshine away..."
>>The next, day...the very next day...the little girl was well enough to go
home!  Woman's Day Magazine called it "The Miracle of a Brother's Song." The
medical staff just called it a miracle.
Karen called it a miracle of God's love!

 NEVER GIVE UP ON THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE. LOVE IS SO
INCREDIBLY POWERFUL.
Life is good. Have a Wonderful Day!

This is the power of prayer at work.  Let's continue to pray for
one another.

PRAYER:
May today there be peace within you. May you trust God that you are exactly
where you are meant to be. May you not forget the infinite possibilities
that
are born of faith. May you use those gifts that you have received, and pass
on
the love that has been given to you. May you be content knowing that you are
a
child of God. Let His presence settle into your bones, and allow your soul
the
freedom to sing, dance, and to bask in the sun. It is there for each and
every
one of you. Send this to others and witness the awesome power of prayer.
Also,
read Phil 4:13
