 Subject: Some armor for the daily battles of life


The only survivor of a shipwreck was washed up on a small, uninhabited 
island.  He prayed feverishly for God to rescue him, and every day he scanned 
the horizon for help, but none seemed forthcoming.  Exhausted, he eventually 
managed to build a little hut out of driftwood to protect himself from the 
elements, and to store his few possessions.  But then one day, after 
scavenging for food, he arrived home to find his little hut in flames, the 
smoke rolling up to the sky. The worst had happened; everything was lost. He 
was stunned with grief and anger.  "God, how could you do this to me!" he 
cried.  Early the next day, however, he was awakened by the sound of a ship 
that was approaching the island. It had come to rescue him.  "How did you 
know I was here?" asked the weary man of his rescuers.  "We saw your smoke 
signal," they replied.

It is easy to get discouraged when things are going bad. But we shouldn't 
lose heart, because God is at work in our lives, even in the midst of pain 
and suffering. Remember, next time your little hut is burning to the ground-- 
it just may be a smoke signal that summons the grace of God.  For all the 
negative things we have to say to ourselves, God  has a positive answer for 
it:

You say: "It's impossible"   --   God says:"All thing are possible" 
(Luke18:27)
You say: "I'm too tired"  --  God says:"I will give you rest" ( Matt11:28-20)
You say: "Nobody really loves me" -- God says:"I love you" (John 3:16 & 
John13:34)
You say: "I can't go on"  --  God says:"My grace is sufficient" (II Cor.12:9 
& Psalm 91:15)             You say: "I can't figure things out" -- God 
says:"I will direct your steps" (Proverbs 3:5-6)
You say: "I can't do it" -- God says:"You can do all things" (Phil 4:13)
You say: "I'm not able" -- God says:"I am able" (II Cor.9:8)
You say:"It's not worth it"  --  God says:"It will be worth it" (Romans 8:28)
You say: "I can't forgive myself"  --  God says:"I forgive you" ( I John 1:9 
& Romans 8:1)
You say: "I can't manage"  -- God says:"I will supply all your needs" (Phil 
4:19)
You say: "I'm afraid"  -- God says:"I have not given you a spirit of fear (II 
Tim. 1:7)
You say: "I'm always worried and frustrated"  --  God says:"Cast all your 
cares on ME" ( I Peter 5:7)
You say: "I don't have enough faith" -- God says: I've given everyone a 
measure of faith (Rom. 12:3)
You say: "I'm not smart enough"  -- God says "I give you wisdom (I Cor 1:30)
You say: "I feel all alone" -- God says:"I will never leave you or forsake 
you" (Heb. 13:5)

Pass this on, you never know whose life may be in need of this today.  I 
believe there are some weeks that we all feel our huts are burning.
