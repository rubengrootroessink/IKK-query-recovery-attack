SERC

Evening peak prices remained strong until he 22.  OPC was a low 40's bid 
untill he 22.  We prescheduled 100 mw's to SOCO for $95 from he 20-22.  SCEG, 
DUKE  and SC were low 40's bids for the evening peak.  CPL was the only 
reasonable offer at $60.   TLR's prevented any new schedules from being 
started until he 23.    Off- peak bids were in the low to mid teen's.  SOCO 
was buying $15 from their neighbor's.  Vepco offered out $14.00 into TVA or 
into EES for off-peak.  This power ended up being sold to EES.  EES would not 
show us a bid for off-peak.   For Wednesday SOCO and SCEG will be buying 
hourly after the morning peak.  Duke and Vepco will be buying for economics.  
SOCO did not want to pre-schedule anything for Wednesday.  

 SERC    16 hour average:  BID  $ 50  OFFER $ 80


FRCC

Bids were not very strong in Florida for the evening peak.   Rain helped the 
Florida utilities cover their loads.  For he 21-22 TAL, FPL and FPC were mid 
40's to mid 50's bids for the evening peak.  The only offer for the evening 
peak was a $100 offer from FPL.   For off-peak, bids were in the mid teens, 
there was no real interest in buying off-peak.   FPC and FP&L  will wait 
until mid morning to look for preschedules.
