Conformed to His Image
Romans 8:29-30
Faith Thoughts for February 3
by Pastor Carl Stevens

The transformed believer enjoys tremendous freedom. II Corinthians 3:17b
says, "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty." This liberty comes
as the Christian is freed from his natural disposition, with its inevitable
anxiety and loneliness, and is transformed into the image of his Lord. "But
we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are
changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the
Lord" (II Corinthians 3:18).
It is in this manner that the child of God is able to function in the Kingdom
of God. He is transformed by the image of Jesus Christ functioning and
operating in his human vessel, bringing every thought and imagination into
the obedience of Jesus Christ (2). As the believer presents his body as a
living sacrifice to the Lord, he will experience the good, acceptable, and
perfect will of God (3).

Rather than conforming to the world and its system, the believer is inwardly
changed and transformed to the image of Christ by the power of God (4).
Anxiety, cosmic loneliness, and its undefined consequences are dealt with and
resolved in the transformation.

(1) Romans 8:29-30 For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be
conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many
brethren. (30) Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and
whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also
glorified.
(2) 2 Corinthians 10:5 Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that
exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity
every thought to the obedience of Christ.
(3) Romans 12:1-2 I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God,
that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,
which is your reasonable service. (2) And be not conformed to this world: but
be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is
that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.
(4) Romans 8:29 For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be
conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many
brethren.
