A Box Full of Kisses


The story goes that some time ago, a man punished his 3-year old daughter
for
wasting a roll of gold wrapping paper. Money was tight and he became
infuriated
when the child tried to decorate a box to put under the Christmas tree.
Never
the less, the little girl brought the box to her father the next morning
and
said, "This is for you Daddy". He was embarrassed by his earlier over
reaction,
but his temper flared again when he found that the box was empty. He
yelled at
her, " Don't you know when you give someone a present, there's supposed
to be
something inside it". The little girl looked at him with tears in her
eyes and
said, "Oh, Daddy, it's not empty, I blew Kisses into the box. All for
you,
Daddy" The father was crushed. He put his arms around his little girl and
begged
for her forgiveness. An accident took the life of the child only a short
time
later and it is told that man kept that gold box by his bed for many
years and
whenever he was discouraged, he would take out an imaginary kiss and
remember
the love of the child who had put it there. In a very real sense, each of
us, as
humans, have been given a gold container filled with unconditional love
and
kisses from our children, friends, family or God. There is no more
precious
possession anyone can hold.

Friends are angels who lift us to our feet when our wings have trouble
remembering how to fly.
