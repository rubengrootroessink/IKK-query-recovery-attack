Subject: checkout for 5/3 hourly deals

Guys,

I know this is getting to the point of nagging, but the day guys are doing a 
BAD job of getting there stuff in the P&L and Enpower.  We are having to 
spend too much time going back and researching tags and comparing enpower to 
P&L and vice versa before we can even begin to checkout.  I spent two hours 
having to go through many deals (in both books) to figure out what happened 
before we could begin checkouts.  I understand some human errors occur - 
that's why we do checkout's but much of this I feel is just laziness and guys 
not paying attention.  Can you guys address this and try to implement some 
steps to help correct this.  With the lack of bodies on the night shift, this 
is causing problems.

Thanks,
Doug
