A doctor was having an affair with his nurse. Shortly 
after this started, she told him she was pregnant. Not 
wanting his wife to know, he gave the nurse a large 
sum of money and asked her to go to Italy and have the 
baby there. 

"But how will I let you know the baby is born?" she 
asked. 

He replied, "Just send me a postcard and write 
'spaghetti' on the back." 

Not knowing what else to do, the nurse took the money 
and flew to Italy. Six months went by and then one day 
the doctor's wife called him at the office and 
explained, "Dear, you received a very strange postcard 
in the mail today and I don't understand what it 
means." 

The doctor said, "Just wait until I get home and read 
it and I will explain it to you." 

Later that evening the doctor came home, read the 
postcard, fell to the floor with a heart attack - and 
died. 

So the wife picked up the cord and read, "Spaghetti, 
Spaghetti, Spaghetti, Spaghetti - two with sausage and 
meatballs, two without."
