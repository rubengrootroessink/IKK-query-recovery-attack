Subject: Fwd: A Child's Question



Once upon a time there was a child ready to be born.   The child asked God, 
"They tell me you are sending me to earth tomorrow, but I am so small and 
helpless, how will I be able to live there?"   God replied, "Among my many 
angels, the one I have chose for you will be waiting for you and take care of 
you."

The child further inquired, "Here in heaven all I have to do is sing and 
smile to be happy, what happens when I go to earth?"   God said, "Your angel 
will sing for you and smile for you every day. You will feel your angel's 
love and be very happy."

Again the child asked, "I don't know the language, how will I understand when 
people talk to me?"   God said, "Your angel will tell you the most beautiful 
and sweet words you will ever hear and with much patience and care, teach you 
how to speak."

"And what am I going to do when I want to talk to you?"   God said, "Your 
angel will place your hands together and teach you how to pray."

"I've heard there are bad men on Earth, who will protect me?"  God said, 
"Your angel will defend you, and even risk its life for you."

"I will not see you anymore, and I will be sad."    God said "Your angel will 
talk to you about me and teach you the way to come back to me.  I will always 
be next to you."

At that moment there was much peace in heaven, but voices from Earth could be 
heard, and the child hurriedly asked, "God, it's time for me to leave now, 
will you please tell me my angel's name?"    God replied, "Her name is not 
important, you will simply call her Mom."
