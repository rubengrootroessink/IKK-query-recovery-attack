ECAR
  
There was plenty of generation online for Sat. and Sun.  FE offered out 150 
mw's at $38 for a 16-hr. schedule for Monday.  No one had any interest at 
this price level.  There were no decent bids for saturday or sunday.   On 
saturday we moved  Ecar power down to Florida most of the day until TLR's 
were called.  On sunday during the evening peak Soco was on the bid($25), 
unfortunately TLR's prevented any energy from moving into Serc.  Most 
utilities will be sellers in the morning.

MAIN

 TLR's were abundant over the weekend.  CE, Ameren and other Main members 
were not able to send power into Serc or Frcc.  No legitimate bids while 
sellers had plenty of power.  Ameren was an island due to TLR's.  CE will be 
selling hourly all day Monday.  CE quoted an offer of $36 for a 16-hr 
schedule, for he 7 they quoted $12, with no bids to move it to.   Ameren will 
also be selling hourly if TLR's do not kick in.  No one had any interest in 
picking up a preschedule.
