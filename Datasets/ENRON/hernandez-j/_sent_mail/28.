THIS IS REALLY BEAUTIFUL.   To all the beautiful moms I know.    -k

>
>"Why are you crying?", a young boy asked his Mom.
>
>"Because I'm a woman", she told him.
>
>"I don't understand", he said.    His Mom just hugged
>him and said, "And you never will, but that's ok".......
>
>Later the little boy asked his father, "Why does Mom
>seem to cry for no reason?"    "All women cry for no
>reason",was all his Dad could say......
>
>The little boy grew up and became a man, still wondering
>why women cry.
>
>Finally he put in a call to God and when God got back
>to him, he asked "God, why do women cry so easily?"
>
>
>GOD answered......"When I made woman, I decided she
>had to be special. I made her shoulders strong enough
>to carry the weight of the world, yet, made her arms
>gentle enough to give comfort...
>
>I gave her the inner strength to endure childbirth and
>the rejection that many times will come even from her
>own children.
>
>I gave her a hardness that allows her to keep going
>and take care of her family and friends, even when
>everyone else gives up, through sickness and fatigue,
>without complaining....
>
>I gave her the sensitivity to love her children under
>any and all circumstances.  Even when her child has
>hurt her badly....
>
>She has the very special power to make a child's
>boo-boo feel better and to quell a teenager's
>anxieties and fears....
>
>I gave her strength to care for her husband, despite
>faults and fashioned her from his rib to protect his
>heart.
>
>I gave her wisdom to know that a good husband never
>hurts his wife, but sometimes tests her strengths and
>her resolve to stand beside him, unfalteringly.
>
>For all of this hard work, I also gave her a tear to
>shed. It is hers to use whenever needed and it is her
>only weakness....
>
>When you see her cry, tell her how much you love her,
>and all she does for everyone, and even though she may
>still cry, you will have made her heart feel good.
>She is special!"
>
>Please send this to women you know, and those with
>mothers, sisters, and special women  in their lives....
