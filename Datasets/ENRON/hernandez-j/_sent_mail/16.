M Deal #333292 A&B was sent to the file room to be faxed to the counterparty. 
After being faxed we are to track as sent to counterparty. This deal is not 
in the Tagg system. I  called and informed Ana Rizvi on this matter this 
morning. I checked Tagg again and this deal has not been entered at this 
time.
