        > A man runs into the vet's office carrying his dog, screaming for
help.
        > The vet rushes him back to an examination room and has him put his

dog
        > down on the examination table. The vet examines the still, limp
body
        > and after a few moments, tells the man that his dog, regrettably,
is
        > dead. The man, clearly agitated and not willing to accept this,
        > demands a second opinion. The vet goes into the back room and
comes
        > out with a cat and puts the cat down next to the dog's body. The
cat
        > sniffs the body, walks from head to tail, poking and sniffing the
        > dog's body and finally looks at the vet and meows.
        >
        > The vet looks at the man and says, "I'm sorry, but the cat thinks
that
        > you're dog is dead, too." The man is still unwilling to accept
that
        > his dog is dead. So the vet brings in a black lab, the lab sniffs
the
        > body, walks from head to tail, and finally looks at the vet and
barks.
        > The vet looks at the man and says, "I'm sorry, but the lab thinks
your
        > dog is dead too."
        >
        > The man, finally resigned to the diagnosis, thanks the vet and
asks
        > how much he owes. The vet answers, "$650."
        >
        > "$650 to tell me my dog is dead?" exclaims the man.
        >
        > "Well," the vet replies, "I would only have charged you $50 for my

        > initial diagnosis. The additional $600 was for the cat scan and
lab
        > tests."
