Subject: The Tree


This is a nice story, I hope you enjoy it.

> > A long time ago, there was a huge apple tree.  A little boy loved to
> > come and play around it everyday. He climbed to the tree top, ate the
> > apples, took a nap under the shadow... He loved the tree and the tree
> > loved to play with him.
> > Time went by... the little boy had grown up and he no longer played
> > around the tree everyday.  One day, the boy came back to the tree and
> > he looked sad. "Come and play with me," the tree asked the boy.
> > "I am no longer a kid, I don't play around trees anymore." The boy
> > replied, "I want toys. I need money to buy them."
> > "Sorry, but I don't have money...but you can pick all my apples and
> > sell them.  So, you will have money."  The boy was so excited.  He
> > grabbed all the apples on the tree and left happily.  The boy never
> > came back after he picked the apples.  The tree was sad.
> > One day, the boy returned and the tree was so excited. "Come and
> > play with me" the tree said. "I don't have time to play.  I have to
> > work for family. We need a house for shelter. Can you help me?"
> > "Sorry, but I don't have a house. But you can chop off my branches
> > to build your house." So the boy cut all the branches of the tree
> > and left happily. The tree was glad to see him happy but the boy
> > never came back since then. The tree was again lonely and sad.
> > One hot summer day, the boy returned and the tree was delighted.
> > "Come and play with me!" the tree said. "I am sad and getting old." the > 
> boy replied.  I want to go sailing to relax myself. Can you give me a
> > boat?"
> > "Use my trunk to build your boat. You can sail far away and be happy."
> > So the boy cut the tree trunk to make a boat. He went sailing and
> > never showed up for a long time.
> > Finally, the boy returned after he left for so many years.
> > "Sorry, my boy. But I don't have anything for you anymore. No more
> > apples for you..." the tree said. "I don't have teeth to bite" the boy
> > replied.
> > "No more trunk for you to climb on"
> > "I am too old for that now" the boy said.
> > "I really can't give you anything ... the only thing left is my dying
> > roots" the tree said with tears.
> > "I don't need much now, just a place to rest. I am tired after all
> > these years." The boy replied.
> > "Good! Old tree roots is the best place to lean on and rest.  Come,
> > Come sit down with me and rest."
> > The boy sat down and the tree was glad and smiled, with tears.......> >

> > This is a story of everyone. The tree is our parent.
> > When we were young, we loved to play with Mom and Dad...  When we
> > grew up, we left them..only came to them when we needed something
> > or when we are in trouble.
> > No matter what, parents will always be there and give everything they
> > can to make you happy.  You may think the boy is cruel to the tree
> > but that's how all of us are treating our parent.
> > Please enlighten all you friends by forward this mail> to them.  And
> > love your parents. And tell your kids.
> >> > Hope it means something to u!
