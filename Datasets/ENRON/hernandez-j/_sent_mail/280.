SERC- For Saturday SOCO was on the bid  in the mid 40's during the afternoon 
peak.  They were buying up to 500mw from FPL.  The Florida utilities were 
sellers due the rains they were getting in the afternoon.  SCEG was a low 
30's bid during the afternoon bid.  Duke was flat all day.  OPC was also a 
hig 30's bid much of the afternoon.  We managed to sell SOCO 200 mws for 2 
hours until TLR's ended the sale.  

 -For Sunday SOCO was a low 20' bid in the morning and in the afternoon was a 
low 30's bid.  Duke was seller  in the mid 30's all day.  SCEG was also an 
hourly seller, unfortunately SCEG was limited to where they could go.  DUKE 
and VEPCO will have hourly to sell for Monday. 


FRCC-For Saturday Florida was a seller due to rains over much of the state.  
FPL was offering 60's much of the day.  They were a big seller to SOCO much 
of Saturday.  

 -For Sunday things were a little different.  FPL was a bid in the low 60's 
for the afternoon peak.  By afternoon time TLR's prevented any power from 
going into Florida.  


ERCOT- For Saturday an afternoon schedule traded for $75 and after this went 
through ERCOT prices went up.  WE sold $75  to Reliant for HE 16.  For HE 
17-19 no power was to be found in ERCOT.  HLP was $100 bid for these hours.  
TU would not show us bid for these hours.  

 -For Sunday power was offered out at $55 with no bids(low 30's bids).  No 
transmission avail. for HE 14-19 going up to the North.
