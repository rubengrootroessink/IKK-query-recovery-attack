SERC

A very quiet night in SERC.  Evening peak prices fell off hard due to rain 
covering  SOCO's control area.  OPC was the best bid for the evening peak he 
21-22($60-$70).  SOCO would not show a bid for the evening peak.  For he 
21-23 SOCO began to sell about 400mw's to SCEG, SC and GTC.  The TLR called 
by TVA on the Bowen-Sequoyah has not been re-called as of 3:00 a.m.  TVA has 
not been able to bring in power from the north.   TVA must be doing well 
generation wise since they did not import power from its neighbors.  For 
off-peak SOCO was $14 @ $22.  SCEG was a $15 bid.   For friday SOCO, OPC and 
SCEG will be on the bid.       

 SERC    16 hour average:  BID  $ 42.7  OFFER $ 72.5



FRCC

Importing power into Florida was again a problem up until off-peak.  For the 
evening peak FPL and FPC were bidding in the mid 40's.  For he 22 FPL bought 
$21 and for off-peak  FPL was a mid teens bid.   Both TEC and TAL were flat 
for the evening peak and the off-peak.   With TLR's expected again for 
friday, the night guys at FPC and FPL are going to let the day guys make a 
decision on any b.o.d preschedules.      
        
 FRCC   16 hour average:  BID  $ 68.8  OFFER $ 139.7
