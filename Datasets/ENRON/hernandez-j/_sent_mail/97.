Subject: Love Ya!

Did Anyone Ever Tell You,
Just How Special You Are
The Light that You Emit
Might even Light a Star

Did Anyone Ever Tell You
How Important You Make Others Feel
Somebody out here is Smiling
About Love that is so Real

Did Anyone Ever Tell You
Many Times, When They were Sad
Your E-mail made Them Smile a bit
In Fact It made Them Glad

For the Time You Spend Sending Things
And Sharing whatever You Find
There are No Words to Thank You
But Somebody, Thinks You're Fine

Did Anyone Ever Tell You
Just How Much They Love You
Well,  My Dearest " Online "  Friend
Today I am Telling You

 ++++++++++++++++++

I HOPE I GET THIS BACK

I believe that without a friend
you are missing out on a lot!!!
Don't be confused by friends and
acquaintances, there is a difference!

Because I care about you,

It's national care week . . .
and you get to send messages to 
all your friends telling them 
that you care about them and 
make them feel good about
themselves and if they write
back . . . (just once)
then that means that they care
about you too.

BUT, you have to send it right now!!
Send it to everyone you care
about and if they send it back . . . 
that means they care too.
but don't just send it back,
send it on to everyone..

Have a nice day, and I'm glad we
are friends!!!
