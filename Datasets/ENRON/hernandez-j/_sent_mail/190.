Subject: Fwd: Prayer Request

   When you receive this e-mail just recite the following prayer.
That's all you have to do.  There is nothing attached.  This is the power of 
prayer at work.  Just send this to (7) people and see what happens on the 
seventh day.

      Do not break this, please.  There is no cost, but lots of rewards.
Let's continue to pray for one another.

      PRAYER::
      May today there be peace within you.  May you trust God that you are 
exactly where you are meant to be.  May you not forget the infinite 
possibilities that are born of faith.  May you use those gifts that you have 
received, and pass on the love that has been given to you.  May you be 
content knowing that you are a child of God.  Let His presence settle into 
your bones, and allow your soul the freedom to sing, dance, and to bask in 
the sun.  It is there for each and every one of you

Amen

Send this to (7) or more people and witness the awesome power of prayer.
