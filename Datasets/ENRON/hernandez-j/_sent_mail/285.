FRCC-- For Saturday.   FPL and FPC were buying in the mid 40's for HE 9-12.  
For HE 13-17 they were bidding  mid 50's to low 60's. Starting HE 12 TLR's 
prevented any nf-h going into FRCC.   Our hourly sale to FPL was bumped  due 
to implementation of firm trans.  We were buying nf-h.   


SERC--For Saturday.  SOCO began to bid in the mid-30's starting HE 12.   For 
HE 13 TVA called a TLR and SOCO lost about 400 mw's that he was buying from 
TVA and others.  They did not change their bid after these cuts, they told us 
they were going to bring up their own units and would only buy for $35.  
DUK,SCEG,OPC and TVA were flat all day or selling a little each hour to 
SOCO.  No bids from these utilities for Saturday.  

ERCOT--For Saturday.  Very quiet day in ERCOT.   Bid's were in the 30's with 
offer's in the high $40's to low 60's.  TU claimed he was buying in the 
$35-$37 range for he 13-18.  HLP was flat for these hours.  CSW was a low 
30's bid with a mid 50's offer.   Smaller players were low 30's bid.
