This is really great, it was through my mother's death that I was blessed 
with meeting Tim. The Lord is faithful and so good to us !!


MOM'S LAST LAUGH.....

Consumed by my loss, I didn't notice the hardness of the
pew where I sat.  I was at the funeral of my dearest friend - my mother.

She finally had lost her long battle with cancer. The hurt
was so intense, I found it hard to breathe at times.

Always supportive, Mother clapped loudest at my school
plays, held a box of tissues while listening to my first heartbreak, 
comforted me at my father's death, encouraged me in college,
and prayed for me my entire life.

When Mother's illness was diagnosed, my sister had a new
baby and my brother had recently married his childhood sweetheart, so it fell 
on me, the 27-year-old middle child without entanglements, to take care of 
her. I counted it an honor.

"What now, Lord?" I asked sitting in church. My life
stretched out before me as an empty abyss. My brother sat stoically with his 
face toward the cross while clutching his wife's hand. My sister sat slumped 
against her husband's shoulder,
his arms around her as she cradled their child.

All so deeply grieving, no one noticed I sat alone.

My place had been with our mother, preparing her meals,
helping her walk, taking her to the doctor, seeing to her medication, reading 
the Bible together. Now she was with the Lord.

My work was finished, and I was alone.

I heard a door open and slam shut at the back of the
church. Quick footsteps hurried along the carpeted floor. An exasperated 
young man looked around briefly and then sat
next to me. He folded his hands and placed them on his
lap. His eyes were brimming with tears. He began to sniffle.

"I'm late," he explained, though no explanation was
necessary.  After several eulogies, he leaned over and commented, "Why do 
they keep calling Mary by the name of 'Margaret'?

"0h" "Because that was her name, Margaret. Never Mary. No
one called her 'Mary,'" I whispered. I wondered why this person couldn't have 
sat on the other side of the church. He interrupted my grieving with his 
tears and fidgeting.

Who was this stranger anyway?

"No, that isn't correct," he insisted, as several people
glanced over at us whispering, "Her name is Mary, Mary Peters."

"That isn't who this is."

"Isn't this the Lutheran church?"

"No, the Lutheran church is across the street."   "Oh."

"I believe you're at the wrong funeral, Sir."

The solemnness of the occasion mixed with the realization
of the man's mistake bubbled up inside me and came out as laughter. I cupped 
my hands over my face, hoping it would be interpreted as sobs.  The creaking 
pew gave me away. Sharp looks from other mourners only made the situation 
seem more hilarious. I peeked at the bewildered, misguided man seated beside 
me. He was laughing, too, as he glanced around,
deciding it was too late for an uneventful exit.  I imagined
Mother laughing.

At the final "Amen," we darted out a door and into the
parking lot. "I do believe we'll be the talk of the town," he smiled. He said 
his name was Rick and since he had missed his aunt's funeral, asked me out 
for a cup of coffee.

That afternoon began a lifelong journey for me with this
man who attended the wrong funeral, but was in the right place.

A year after our meeting, we were married at a country church where he was 
the assistant pastor. This time we both arrived at the same church, right on 
time.

In my time of sorrow, God gave me laughter. In place of
loneliness, God gave me love. This past June we celebrated
our twenty-second wedding anniversary.

Whenever anyone asks us how we met, Rick tells them, "Her
mother and my Aunt Mary introduced us, and it's truly a match made in heaven."

                       ------------------------

Jesus said, "if you are ashamed of me," I will be ashamed
of you before my  Father."

Not ashamed Pass this on . . . only if you mean it.

Yes, I do Love God.

 He is my source of existence and Savior. He keeps me
functioning each and everyday. Without Him, I would be nothing. Without him, 
I am nothing, but with Him I can do all things, through Christ that 
strengthens me.  Phil 4:13

If you Love God, and are not ashamed of all the marvelous
things he has done for you. Send this to ten people and the person who sent 
it to you!
