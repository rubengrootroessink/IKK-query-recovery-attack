What actions do you display at work?

I drive into work listening to gospel music or a pre-recorded  sermon on th=
e=20
radio. I get out of the car and walk to the building
entrance. As I open the building door I leave just enough room for me to ge=
t=20
in and I leave Jesus standing outside as the door closes behind me. He's=20
standing with His palms on the door glass and watches me as I get on the=20
elevator.  His eyes are sad and He turns and goes to sit on the stone bench=
.=20
There He sits patiently
and waits for me for the next 9 hours. First two hours of work - I fuss and=
=20
complain about things not going right.  Jesus, sitting
with his chin in His hand looks upward toward the building wishing He could=
=20
help me. By lunchtime - I'm flustered, regretting I work in this place and=
=20
sputtering bitterness all over folks. Jesus comes around to the side of the=
=20
building where my cubicle is located. He looks up from the ground trying to=
=20
get my attention but I can't hear him; my focus is on my problems. Jesus go=
es=20
back to the front of the building, sits down and continues to wait for me. =
He=20
thinks to
Himself as He looks up to the third floor, "They went in there defenseless.=
 =20
If only they had taken me in there with them.  When will they learn?" End o=
f=20
the day - I'm pooped, run down, no energy, irritable & frustrated.  I leave=
=20
the building & Jesus gets up happily to greet me but I'm in no mood for Him=
=20
now.  I've just been to hell and back and the last thing I want to do is be=
=20
bothered with anyone.

God just actually showed me this is how I'VE been acting.  He showed me eac=
h=20
act and worst of all, He let me feel a small
portion of how grieved he was because of my actions and
attitude.  I left Jesus standing outside, almost let the door smack him in=
=20
His face.  From time to time our jobs overwhelm us and we completely forget=
=20
to  "take Jesus with us".  We may not go around cursing anyone out or=20
punching anyone in the face (hopefully not) but what are our actions saying=
=20
about us and about whom or whose we are?

We are the salt of the Earth and the light of the world. A city on a hill=
=20
cannot be hidden.  Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. =
=20
Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the=20
house. Matt. 5:13-15. We should be bringing
peace to our jobs and not be the cause of confusion.  We should be the ones=
=20
to bring our gifts & talents to the table to help in
WHATEVER area God has chosen for us to work in.  Col.3:23-24 "Whatever you=
=20
do, work at it with ALL your heart, as working for the Lord, not for men, =
=20
since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a=20
reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving.
