In the city of Chicago, one cold, dark night, a blizzard was setting in.
A
little boy was selling newspapers on the corner, the people were in and
out of
the cold. The little boy was so cold that he wasn't trying to sell many
papers. He walked up to a policeman and said,

"Mister, you wouldn't happen to know where a poor boy could find a warm
place to
sleep tonight would you?  You see, I sleep in a box up around the corner
there and down the alley and it's awful cold in there at night. Sure would be
nice to have a warm place to stay."

The policeman looked down at the little boy and said, "You go down the
street to that big white house and you knock on the door. When they come
out the door you just say John 3:16 and they will let you in."

So he did, he walked up the steps to the door, and knocked on the door
and a lady answered.  He looked up and said, "John 3:16."

The lady said "Come on in, Son." She took him in and she sat him down in
a split bottom rocker in front of a great big old fireplace and she went off.

He sat there for a while, and thought to himself "John 3:16....  I don't
understand it, but it sure makes a cold boy warm."

Later she came back and asked him "Are you hungry?" He said, "Well, just
a little. I haven't eaten in a couple of days and I guess I could stand a
little bit of food."

The lady took him in the kitchen and sat him down to a table full of
wonderful food. He ate and ate until he couldn't eat any more. Then he
thought to himself "John 3:16... Boy, I sure don't understand it, but it
sure makes a hungry boy full."

She took him upstairs to a bathroom to a huge bathtub filled with warm
water and he sat there and soaked for a while. As he soaked, he thought
to himself, "John 3:16... I sure don't understand it, but it sure makes a
dirty boy
clean. You know, I've not had a bath, a real bath, in my whole life.  The
only
bath I ever had was when I stood in front of that big old fire hydrant as
they flushed it out."

The lady came in and got him, and took him to a room and tucked him into
a big
old feather bed and pulled the covers up around his neck and kissed him
goodnight and turned out the lights. As he laid in the darkness and
looked out
the window at the snow coming down on that cold night he thought to
himself,
"John 3:16... I don't understand it, but it sure makes a tired boy rested."

The next morning she came back up and took him down again to that same
big table full of food. After he ate she took him back to that same big
old split bottom rocker in front of the fireplace and she took a big old
Bible and
sat down in front of him and she looked up at and she asked, "Do you
understand John 3:16?"

He said, "No, Ma'am, I don't. The first time I ever heard it was last
night when the policeman told me to use it."

She opened the Bible to John 3:16 , and she began to explain to him
about Jesus. Right there in front of that big old fireplace he gave his
heart
and life to Jesus. He sat there and thought, "John 3:16. I don't
understand it, but it but it sure makes a lost boy feel safe."

You know, I have to confess I don't understand it either, how God would
be willing to send His Son to die for me, and how Jesus would agree to do
such a
thing. I don't understand it either, but it sure does make life worth living..

John 3:16
16.  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son,
that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting
life..

17.  For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but
that the world through him might be saved.

18.  He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth
not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the
only
begotten Son of God.
