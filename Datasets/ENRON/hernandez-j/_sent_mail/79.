This is a very nice story.  You never know when Jesus will visit you so 
always be willing to give.  I don't consider this to be a chain letter, I 
just like the story and I thought you would too.


Ruth went to her mail box and there was only one letter.  She picked it
up and looked at it before opening, but then  she looked at the envelope
again. There was no stamp, no postmark, only her name and address.  She
read the letter:

Dear Ruth:

I'm going to be in your neighborhood Saturday afternoon and I would like
to visit.

Love Always,
Jesus

Her hands were shaking as she placed the letter on the table.   "Why
would the Lord want to visit me?   I'm nobody special.  I don't have
anything to offer."   With that thought,  Ruth remembered her empty
kitchen cabinets. "Oh my  goodness,  I really don't have anything to
offer.  I'll have to run down  to the store and buy something for
dinner."  She reached for her purse and counted out it's contents.
Five dollars and forty cents. "Well, I can get some bread and cold cuts,
at least."   She threw on her coat and hurried out the door. A loaf of
french bread, a half-pound of sliced turkey, and a carton of
milk...leaving Ruth with grand total of twelve cents to last her until
Monday.   Nonetheless, she felt good as she headed home, her meager
offerings tucked under her arm."Hey lady, can you help us, lady?"  Ruth
had been so absorbed in her dinner plans, she hadn't even noticed two
figures huddled in the alleyway. A man and a woman, both of them dressed
in little more than rags.   "Look lady, I ain't got a job, ya know, and
my wife and I have been living  out here  on the street, and, well, now
it's getting cold and  we're getting kinda hungry and, well, if you
could help us, lady, we'd really appreciate it." Ruth looked at them
both.  They were dirty, they smelled bad and frankly, she was certain
that they could get some kind of work if they really wanted to.  "Sir,
I'd like to help  you, but I'm a poor woman myself.  All I have is a few
cold cuts  and  some  bread, and I'm having an important guest for
dinner  tonight  and  I was planning on serving that to Him." "Yeah,
well, okay lady, I understand.  Thanks anyway."  The man put his arm
around the woman's shoulders,  turned and  he headed back into the
alley.  As she watched them leave, Ruth felt a familiar twinge in her
heart.  "Sir, wait!"   The couple stopped and turned as she ran down the
alley after them.  "Look, why don't you take this food.  I'll figure out
something  else to serve my  guest."  She handed the man her grocery bag
"Thank you lady. Thank you very much!"  "Yes, thank you!" It was the
man's wife, and Ruth could see now that she  was shivering. "You know,
I've got another coat at home.  Here, why don't you take this one."
Ruth unbuttoned her jacket and slipped it over the woman's shoulders.
Then smiling, she turned and walked back to the street...without her
coat and with nothing to serve her guest.

"Thank you lady! Thank you very much!"

Ruth was chilled by the time she reached her front door, and worried
too. The Lord was coming to visit and she didn't have anything to offer
Him.  She fumbled through her purse for the door key.   But as she did,
she noticed another envelope in her mailbox.  "That's odd.  The mailman
doesn't usually come twice in one day."   She took the envelope out of
the box and opened it.

Dear Ruth:

It was so good to see you again.  Thank you for  the lovely meal. And
thank you, too, for the beautiful coat.

Love Always,
Jesus

The air was still cold, but even without her coat, Ruth no  longer
noticed.

If you love Jesus, send this to ten people.   Do not keep this message.

The mantra must leave your hands within 96  hours. You will get a very
pleasant surprise.
