love and blessings
gina


God bless and  have a nice day!

"Father, I ask you to bless my friends, relatives
and email buddies reading this right now.
Show them a new revelation of your love
and power.  Holy Spirit, I ask you to minister
to their spirit at this very moment.
Where there is pain, give them your peace and mercy.
Where there is self-doubt, release a renewed
confidence through your grace, In Jesus precious Name."
Amen
