Something to think about....

> >>Maybe God wants us to meet a few wrong people
before meeting the right one so that when we finally
meet the right person, we will know how to be grateful
for that gift.
> >>
> >>When the door of happiness closes, another opens,
but often times we look so long at the closed door
that we don't see the one which has been opened for
us.
> >>
> >>The best kind of friend is the kind you can sit on
a porch and swing with,never say a word, and then walk
away feeling like it was the best conversation you've
ever had.
> >>
> >>It's true that we don't know what we've got until
we lose it, but it's also true that we don't know what
we've been missing until it arrives.
> >>
> >>Giving someone all your love is never an assurance
that they'll love you back!  Don't expect love in
return; just wait for it to grow in their heart but if
it doesn't, be content it grew in yours.
> >>
> >>It takes only a minute to get a crush on someone,
an hour to like someone,and a day to love someone, but
it takes a lifetime to forget someone.
> >>
> >>Don't go for looks; they can deceive.  Don't go
for wealth; even that fades away.Go for someone who
makes you smile because it takes only a smile to make
a dark day seem bright.  Find the one that makes your
heart smile.
> >>
> >>There are moments in life when you miss someone so
much that you just want to pick them from your dreams
and hug them for real!
> >>
> >>Dream what you want to dream; go where you want to
go; be what you want to be,because you have only one
life and one chance to do all the things you want to
do.
> >>
> >>May you have enough happiness to make you sweet,
enough trials to make you strong, enough sorrow to
keep you human, enough hope to make you  happy.
> >>
> >>Always put yourself in others' shoes.  If you feel
that it hurts you, it probably hurts the other person,
too.
> >>
> >>The happiest of people don't necessarily have the
best of everything; they just make the most of
everything that comes along their way.
> >>
> >>Happiness lies for those who cry, those who hurt,
those who have searched,and those who have tried, for
only they can appreciate the importance of people who
have touched their lives.
> >>
> >>Love begins with a smile, grows with a kiss and
ends with a tear.

The brightest future will always be based on a
forgotten past, you can't go on well in life until you
let go of your past failures and heartaches.
> >>
> >>When you were born, you were crying and everyone
around you was smiling. Live your life so that when
you die, you're the one who is smiling and everyone
around you is crying.
> >>
> >>
> >>
> >>Please send this message to those people who mean
something to you, to those who have touched your life
in one way or another, to those who make you smile
when you really need it, to those that make you see
the
brighter side of things when you are really down, to
those who you want to let them know that you
appreciate their friendship.  And if you don't, don't
worry, nothing bad will happen to you, you will just
miss out on the opportunity to  brighten someone's day
with this message........
