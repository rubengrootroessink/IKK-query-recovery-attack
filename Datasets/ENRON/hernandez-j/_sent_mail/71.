The Biggest Mathematical Miracle in the World!

Moses and his people were in the desert, but
what was he going to do with them?
They had to be fed, and fed is what he did,
according to the Quartermaster General in the
Army.  It is reported that Moses would have to have
had 1500 tons of food each day.

Do you know that to bring that much food each
day, two freight trains, each a mile long,  would be required!
Besides you must remember, they were out in the desert, so they
would have to have firewood to use in cooking the food.
This would take 4000 tons of wood and a few
more  freight trains, each a mile long,  just for one day.

And just think, they were forty years in transit.
And oh yes! They would have to have water. If they
only had enough to drink and wash a few dishes,
it would take 11,000,000 gallons each day, and a
freight train with tank cars, 1800 miles long, just to bring water!

And then another thing! They had to get across
the Red Sea at night. (They did?) Now, if they went on
a narrow path, double file, the line would be 800
miles long and would require 35 days and  nights
to get through. So, there had to be a space in the Red Sea,
3 miles  wide so that they could walk 5000 abreast to get
over in one night.

But then, there is another problem. Each time
they camped at the end of  the day, a campground
two-thirds the size of the state of Rhode Island was
required, or a total of 750 square miles
long...think of  it! This space just for nightly camping.

Do you think Moses figured all this out
before he left Egypt?

I think not!

You see, Moses believed in God.

God took care of these things for him.

Now do you think God has any problem taking
care of all your needs?
I ASKED THE LORD TO BLESS YOU.......
I asked the Lord to bless you As I prayed for you today,
To guide you and protect you As you go along your way....
His love is always with you,
His promises are true,
And when we give Him all our cares,
You know He will see us through.
So when the road you're traveling on
Seems difficult at best,
Just remember I'm here praying
And God will do the rest.

Pass this to at least 10 people you want God to bless, don't
forget to send it back to the one who asked
God to bless you first.
A POSITIVE  ATTITUDE CAUSES A CHAIN REACTION OF
POSITIVE THOUGHTS, EVENTS  AND OUTCOMES!!

"I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me."
              -Philippians 4:13
