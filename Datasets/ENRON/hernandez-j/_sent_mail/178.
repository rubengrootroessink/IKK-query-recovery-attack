A real friend comes early to help you cook and stays late to
help you clean.

A simple friend hates it when you call after he has gone to bed.

A simple friend thinks the friendship is over when you have
anargument.

Pass this on to anyone you care about....if you get it back you
have found your true friends.

A ball is a circle, No beginning, No end.  It keeps us together,
like our circle of friends, but the treasure inside for you to see is
the treasure of friendship you've granted to me.

Today I pass the friendship ball to you.  Pass it on to someone
who is a friend to you.
