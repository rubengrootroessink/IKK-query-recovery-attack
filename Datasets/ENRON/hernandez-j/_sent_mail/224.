This is 80% true.

You know you are at a SERIOUS MEXICAN BIRTHDAY  PARTY IF:
?
1.??? Some of the guests didn't  bring a gift, but brought extra uninvited 
kids.
2.??? When the cake says "Happy  Birthday Mijo" instead of the child's real 
name.
3.??? The party is at Chuck E.  Cheese, but they brought their own food, 
cake, and a pinata.
4.??? It's a party, but there are  more grown-ups than children.
5.??? It's "Mijo's" 1st Birthday and  the party food is carne asada, arroz 
con frijoles puercos, y 10 cases of  beer.
6.??? For entertainment, instead of  playing pin the tail on the donkey, 
there is usually a televised baseball,  football game, or a live fight.
7.??? They don't sing Happy  Birthday, instead everyone is salsa dancing.
8.??? The party was over at 5:00,  it's 10:00 and the party is just starting.
9.??? You find out from Abuela that  Abuelo is taking viagra.
10.??? The host calls someone who's  on their way and tells them to stop and 
get some tortillas and ice.
11.??? The guests start arriving and  the hostess disappears to get ready.
12.??? You hear someone go up to the  birthday child and say "Mira, tan cute!"
13.??? Someone else says? "I'm  going to have to get you something next week 
when I get paid.
14.??? The party is Saturday, and  you get a call from the hostess Friday 
night saying, "I'm giving Mijo a birthday  party tomorrow at 3:00."
15.??? Some guests bring gifts that  are still in the store bag unwrapped.
16.??? There always seems to be more  family than friends at the party.
17.??? You have the party over at  your's brother's because he bought a new 
house and he has a pool.
18.??? The cake didn't come from the  store; it came from the mother of the 
comadre of your friend's sister who makes  really good cakes.
19.??? You are told you have to save  your plate and fork you ate your food 
with, so you can eat you  cake.
20.??? Someone calls and says they  can't make it, but asks that you save 
them some cake.
21.??? Guests are wrapping up cake  to take to Madre, Tio, Abuela, Chata y el 
Junior.
22.??? The party music is coming  from a small boom box.
23.??? The birthday child is dressed  from head to toe in Tommy.
24.??? The birthday baby's Daddy  comes to the party and brings the kid he 
had before and after the Birthday  Baby.
25.??? It's "Mijo's" party, but  since his cousin Madonna is there and her 
birthday is in a few days, it becomes  Mijo's and Madonna's party.
