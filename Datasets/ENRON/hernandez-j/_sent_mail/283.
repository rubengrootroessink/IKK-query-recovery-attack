SERC-   For Saturday we sold 200MW (HE15-19 for a 5 hour take) @ $80.00.  
SCEG and DUKE were bidding in the mid 40's.  Due to TLR's power from the 
North could not flow to SERC.  Off-peak bids for Saturday were in the low 
teens.  SOCO was an $11 bid for off-peak.  Everyone else in SERC was flat or 
a low teen bid.  For Sunday SOCO was a $26 bid during the afternoon peak.  
SCEG was a $34 bid.  TLR's prevented any deals getting done with SCEG during 
the afternoon.  DUKE, SCEG and SOSO will be on the bid for Monday.  

FRCC-   For Saturday we sold power to Florida in the morning but were cut due 
to TLR's starting HE11.  Bids in Florida got to as high as mid 60's.  FPL and 
FPC were the one's bidding in the mid 60's.  TLR's were not lifted until H/E 
1, for H/E 1 we sold FPL $22(100mw's) into JEA.  For Sunday FP&L and TALL 
were both on the BID @ $26-35 Hourly in the morning and  BOD @ $ 55-65.00.  
Sunday morning we began buying  power from CE  and selling it to FPL and 
TALL.  TLR's were called startng H/E 11.  Florida was bidding in the mid 40's 
for a 16-hour schedule for Monday.    Offpeak bids were in the mid teens for 
both Saturday and Sunday night.

ERCOT-  For Saturday bids were in the low to mid 30's.  Offers were in the 
high 40's(CSW and HLP) to mid 50's(TU).  We sold the City of GARLAND $54 for 
he 23 and 24.  Their bid was high due to trans. contraints from the south to 
north.  They had bought power from San Antonio and Reliant which ended up 
being cut.  We ended up buying from CSW(wtu-$48) thinking this was north 
enough.  The ISO killed the deal.  They told us that as of Friday WTU will 
not be allowed to send out any power when south to north transmission is set 
to -0-.  For Sunday bids were in the 30's again.  Reliant and TU told us they 
will be bidding for HE 14-21.  We purchased trans. into ERCOT for these 
hours.
