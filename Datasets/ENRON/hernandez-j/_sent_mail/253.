what is up peppermint?  you missed drew's birthday at mom's.  you did'nt miss 
much except that chris and oscar got mad because we did not include little 
oscar in with drew's birthday party.  so both of them are pissed at mom and 
dad.  and the other thing at the party was that greg and tia celia were both 
there at the party .  they did not talk to each other.  we also had super 
ramiro and his band there for a little while.  don't forget to get drew's 
birthday present, please send cash only!!
