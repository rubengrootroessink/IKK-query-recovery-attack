Mom,
 Will you please pick up my check from Prostaff today and take it home with 
you? If we head out there for church tomorrow I will get it from you. I got 
your e-mail this morning, it was cute. Well I got to go so if you can please 
e-mail me back so I'll know. I'll be checking my e-mails so please write back.

                                                        Love,
                                                        Jennifer
