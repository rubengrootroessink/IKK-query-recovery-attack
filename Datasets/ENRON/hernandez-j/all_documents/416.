=09=09
=09=09A while back we mentioned the problem of Web porn. Several readers wr=
ote to=20
ask how to get involved. Even with a World Wide Web of resources, however,=
=20
the best place to start is locally. The Web can help! You can search for=20
local groups, like churches, clubs, advocacy agencies, and local government=
=20
offices. Many sites will have links to other local and regional groups with=
=20
similar views and goals. There are lots of national and international group=
s,=20
too, but sometimes they aren't what their high-minded names suggest, so be=
=20
sure to check them out before you give them any of your time or money! That=
's=20
another reason to act locally -- it's easier to find out where others stand=
,=20
and your efforts may be more appreciated at the local level than the nation=
al=20
llevel. You can build a network of contacts over time, too -- the Web makes=
=20
it easy to stay in touch and involved.
