> > > > > she peeked out of the window from time to time at all

> > > > > 11 at night until seven in the morning. She paid 65

> > > > > baby-sat for people. I bargained with her to come and

> > > > > arrive with her pajamas on and the kids would already
> > > > > be asleep. This seemed like a good arrangement to her,
> > > > > so we made
> > > > > deal. That night when the little ones and I knelt to
> > > > > say our prayers we all thanked God for finding Mommy a
> > > > > job. And so I started at the Big Wheel. When I got
> > > > > home in the mornings I woke the baby-sitter up and
> > > > > sent her home with one dollar of my tip money-fully
> > > > > half of what I averaged every night. As the weeks went

> > > > > wage. The tires on the old Chevy had the consistency
> > > > > of
> > > > > penny balloons and began to leak. I had to fill them
> > > > > with air on the way to work and again every morning
> > > > > before I could go home. One bleak fall morning, I
> > > > > wagged myself to the car to go home and found four
> > > > > tires in the back seat. New tires! There was no note,
> > > > > no nothing, just those beautiful brand new tires. Had
> > > > > angels taken up residence in Indiana? I wondered.  I

> > > > > would clean up his office. I remember it took me a lot
> > > > > longer to scrub his floor than it did for him to do
> > > > > the tires. I was now working six nights instead of
> > > > > five and it still wasn't enough. Christmas was coming

> > > > > kids.  I found a can of red paint and started
> > > > > repairing and painting some old toys. Then I hid them
> > > > > in the basement so there would be something for Santa
> > > > > to deliver on Christmas morning. Clothes were a worry
> > > > > too.  I was sewing patches on top of patches on the
> > > > > boys pants and soon they would be too far gone to
> > > > > repair. On Christmas Eve the usual customers were
> > > > > drinking coffee in the Big Wheel. These were the
> > > > > truckers, Les, Frank, and Jim, and a state trooper
> > > > > named Joe.  A few musicians were hanging around after
> > > > > a gig at the Legion and were dropping nickels in the
> > > > > pinball machine. The regulars all just sat around and
> > > > > talked through the wee hours of the morning and then
> > > > > left to get home before the sun came up. When it was
> > > > > time for me to go home at seven o'clock on Christmas
> > > > > morning I hurried to the car. I was hoping the kids
> > > > > wouldn't wake up before I managed to get home and get
> > > > > the presents from the basement and place them under
> > > > > the tree. (We had cut down a small cedar tree by the
> > > > > side of the road down by the dump.) It was still dark
> > > > > and I couldn't see much, but there appeared to be some
> > > > > dark shadows in the car-or was that just a trick of
> > > > > the night? Something certainly looked different, but
> > > > > it was hard to tell what. When I reached he car I
> > > > > peered warily into one of the side windows. Then my
> > > > > jaw
> > > > > dropped in amazement.  My old battered Chevy was
> > > > > filled full to the top with boxes of all shapes and
> > > > > sizes. I quickly opened the driver's side door,
> > > > > scrambled inside and kneeled in the front facing the
> > > > > back seat. Reaching back,I pulled off the lid of the
> > > > > top box. Inside was a whole case of little blue jeans,
> > > > > sizes 2-10!  I looked inside another box: It was full
> > > > > of shirts to go with the jeans. Then I peeked inside
> > > > > some of the other boxes: There were candy and nuts and
> > > > > bananas and bags of groceries. There was an enormous
> > > > > ham for baking, and canned vegetables and potatoes.
> > > > > There was pudding and Jell-O and cookies, pie filling
> > > > > and  flour. There was a whole bag of laundry supplies
> > > > > and cleaning items.  And there were five toy trucks
> > > > > and one beautiful little doll. As I drove back through
> > > > > empty streets as the sun slowly rose on the most
> > > > > amazing Christmas Day of my life, I was sobbing with
