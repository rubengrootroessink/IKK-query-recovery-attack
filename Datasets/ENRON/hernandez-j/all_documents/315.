Hello sunshine.  How are things ?  I must say the Lord has really been 
blessing me and my family.  Tell all the prayer warriors I said Thank you.  
There's no way Thank you is enough. I cannot believe the out pour of help 
that came my way.  My load has been lifted considerably, I have a smile on my 
face.  Our God is an awesome God.  He reign's from Heaven about with power 
and love, our God is an awesome God.  I have gotten so many card and letters 
it is unbelievable.  I am so overwhelmed by all of this I can't help but to 
cry.  When people don't even know you they come to your rescue. The Lord is 
going to Bless each and every one of them richly.  Tell all of them I said I 
love them with love of the Lord.  If there is anything I can ever do please, 
please call on me.  The Lord is going to Bless me to be in a position one 
day, I can help someone it is just a matter of time.  And for you Darlene - I 
Love You.  You have always showed concern for me and my family, even when you 
were having problems yourself.  I just Love You!!! May the Lord continue to 
Bless you and your family abundantly. Can I send an e-mail to the saints, the 
one I have their name?  Let me know.  Keep me on your prayer list I will be 
going to the doctor, that always makes me a wreck.  Also, have you heard 
anything about lil Michael?  I want to know how he is doing, I am so sure the 
Lord pulled him though. Please let me know.  I will write again tomorrow, my 
son just walked in I do not want my kids to know my situation, they do not 
need stress, especially him.   I Love you all.

Be Blessed in Jesus Name.
Kat
