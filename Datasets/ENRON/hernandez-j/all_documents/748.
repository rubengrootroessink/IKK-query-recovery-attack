John,

At the ATC Panel meeting in South Bend, I provided some information about
FirstEnergy's new  transmission subsidiary, American Transmission Systems,
Inc. (ATSI).  I have some updated information.

ATSI went commercial today, September 1. ATSI is a wholly owned subsidiary
of FirstEnergy Corp. and owns and operates all of FirstEnergy's transmission
facilities at voltages of 69 kV and above. ATSI is the transmission provider
and performs the control area operator function for the FE control area. You
may want to visit ATSI's OASIS home page, which can be accessed the same way
as its predecessor FE OASIS home page. The organization charts, tariff,
provider information, etc., have been updated to ATSI. ATSI's public web
site is located at "http://www.atsi-transmission.com."

A change has been made in the timing for the recognition of "ATSI" as the
transmission provider mnemonic . NERC has informed us that upon reflection
it would be easier for them to accommodate the mnemonic change from "FE" to
"ATSI" at midnight on November 1 rather than 8:00 a.m. EST. So currently the
changeover is set for 0001 hours, EST (midnight) on November 1.

The control area designation remains "FE."  As you know, path POR/PODs are
based on the control areas. Thus, beginning November 1, the path name for
transfers to AEP, for example, will change from "E/FE/FE-AEP//" to
"E/ATSI/FE-AEP//." Note that the abbreviated path names, as used in the ECAR
ATC Coordination System, will not change (e.g., "FE-AEP"). Beginning
November 1, the Transmission Provider (TP) column on E-tags must show "ATSI"
not "FE" or they will be refused by ATSI's automatic tagging validation
software.

I hope this clarifies, rather than confuses. Please share this information
with the ATC Panel contacts.

Thank you,
Dick
