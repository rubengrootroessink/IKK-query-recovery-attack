Dear Friends,

Praise God the girls are going home!  We're scheduled to leave the
hospital tomorrow around 12:00pm.  It's been a long haul but the Lord has
brought us through, one day at a time.

We give God thanks for all of your prayers.  It's been a remarkable
experience to see the outpouring of concern and love from all of you.
God has heard your prayers!  Thanks!

The girls are really doing well (obviously).  Both girls will go home
with feeding tubes and the hope is to get Charity off it within a matter
of weeks while the doctors expect Kathleen to take a little longer.  But
we know God can change that and make the time much shorter.  Please
remember this in your prayers.

I will try to update the web page with updates on the progress of the
girls and current prayer requests in the days ahead.

Thanks again and may the God of restoration (Acts 3:21) bless you.

Greg
