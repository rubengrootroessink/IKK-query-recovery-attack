Cool Site of the Day

 


The ancient Chinese art of origami (which literally means "to fold paper") is 
remarkably documented at Joseph Wu's Origami Page. And whether you're a 
seasoned pro or have never heard the term until now, you've got to check this 
site out. For the uninitiated, there are many galleries to roam around that 
contain some of the wildest paperfolding you will surely ever see - check out 
Wu's own paper microscope for proof. You will also find the history of the 
art, links to origami sites across the entire Web, instructions on how to 
learn the art, supply information, and plenty of diagrams on how to perfect 
some of the more popular folds. Old pros will find a community thriving here 
that will support even the most wild paper-folders out there. Get to it!
