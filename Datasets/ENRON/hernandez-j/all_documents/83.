60 Seconds for God

Take 60 seconds & give this a shot! Let's just see if Satan stops this one.

All you do is -

1) Simply say a small prayer for the person who sent you this, (Father God, 
bless this person in whatever it is that You know he or she may be needing 
this day!)

2)Then send it on to five other people.

Within hours five people have prayed for you, and you caused a multitude of 
people to pray to God for other people. Then sit back and watch the power of 
God work in your life for doing the thing that you know He loves.

Please send it back to me, so that I can also pray for you!!!
