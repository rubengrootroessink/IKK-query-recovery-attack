	Some of the best Websites are created by The People Who Have Too Much Free 
Time - and if someone recreating over 180 scenes from the Star Wars Trilogy 
entirely out of Lego blocks isn't a sign of someone who's got too much free 
time, then I don't know what is. That's right, a scary individual who most 
likely lives in a basement somewhere has spent a jaw-dropping 2,600 hours 
recreating Star Wars in Lego format and has put it all on a Web site for the 
geek in all of us to check out. Warped and strange? Probably. Creative and 
interesting? Definitely. http://www5b.biglobe.ne.jp/~mbsf

	Chai is the word for tea in many parts of the world. India's take on chai is 
gaining popularity in the U.S. and has found a home on the menu at Starbucks 
and other coffee houses. It is a spiced milk tea containing rich black tea, 
heavy milk, a combination of various spices and a sweetener. The spices used 
can vary but are usually cardamom, cinnamon, ginger, cloves and pepper. For

	Phone Phun
	There was this phone company that was going hire one of two teams of 
telephone pole installers and it was up to the boss to choose. 
	
	So the boss said to both teams, "Here's what we'll do. Each team will be 
installing poles out on the new road. The team that installs the most poles 
gets the job." Both teams headed right out. At end of shift, one team came 
back and the boss asked them how many they had installed and they said  
they'd put 12 in. Forty-five minutes later, the other team came back in and 
they were dragging. The boss said, "Well, how many poles did you guys 
install?" The team leader wiped his brow and sighed, "We got three in." 
	
	The boss gasped, "Three? Those other guys put 12 in!" 
	
	"Yeah," said the leader, "But you should see how much they left sticking 
out!"
