--- Original Message -------

=7F
Every once in a while a really good message gets circulated--this is one of
them!

A little boy is telling his Grandma how's everything is going wrong.
--------------------

School,
family problems, severe health problems, etc.

Meanwhile, Grandma is baking a cake.
She asks her grandson if he would like a snack, which of course he does.
"Here, have some cooking oil."

"Yuck" says the boy.

"How about a couple raw eggs? "

"Gross, Grandma!"

"Would you like some flour then? Or maybe baking soda?"

"Grandma, those are all yucky!"

To which Grandma replies: "Yes, all those things seem bad all by themselves=
.
But when they are put together in the right way, they make a wonderfully
delicious cake! God works the same way. Many times we wonder why he would
let
us
go through such bad and difficult times.

But God knows that when He puts these things all in His order, they always
work for good!

We just have to trust Him and, eventually, they will all make something
wonderful!"  God is Crazy About You. If God had a refrigerator, your pictur=
e
would be on it.

If He had a wallet, your photo would be in it. He sends you flowers every
spring and a sunrise every morning.

Whenever you want to talk, He'll listen. He can live anywhere in the
universe, and He chose your heart.

Face it, He's crazy about you.
