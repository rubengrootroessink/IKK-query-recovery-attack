>WHY JESUS IS BETTER THAN SANTA CLAUS??
>
>Santa lives at the North Pole - JESUS is everywhere.
>
>Santa rides in a sleigh - JESUS rides on the wind and walks on the
>water.
>
>Santa comes but once a year - JESUS is our ever-present help.
>
>Santa fills your stockings with goodies - JESUS supplies all your needs.
>
>Santa comes down your chimney uninvited - JESUS stands at your door and
>knocks, and then enters your heart when invited.
>
>You have to wait in line to see Santa - JESUS is as close as the mention
>of His name.
>
>Santa lets you sit on his lap - JESUS lets you rest in His arms.
>
>Santa doesn't know your name, all he can say is  "Hi little boy or girl,
>what's your name?" - JESUS knew our name even before we were born.  Not
>only does He know our name, He knows our address too. He knows our
>history and future.  He even knows how many hairs are on our heads.
>
>Santa has a belly like a bowl full of jelly - JESUS has a heart full of
>love
>
>All Santa can offer is "HO HO HO" ... - JESUS offers health, help and
>"hope."
>
>Santa says, "You better not cry" - JESUS says "Cast all your cares on me
>for I care for you."
>
>Santa's little helpers make toys - JESUS makes new life, mends wounded
>hearts, repairs broken homes and builds mansions.
>
>Santa may make you chuckle, but JESUS gives you joy that is your
>strength.
>
>While Santa puts gifts under your tree ... - JESUS became our gift and
>He died on a tree.. The cross!
>
>We need to put Christ back in CHRISTmas, Jesus is still
>the reason for the season.
>
>For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that
>whosoever believeth in Him should
>not perish, but have everlasting life.
>John 3:16
>
>May I be the first to wish you A Blessed Holiday Season!
>
