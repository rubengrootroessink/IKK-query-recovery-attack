Subject: Silent Prayer



Now I sit me down in school Where praying is against the rule
For this great nation under God Finds mention of Him very odd.
If Scripture now the class recites, It violates the Bill of Rights.
And anytime my head I bow Becomes a Federal matter now.  Our hair
can be purple, orange or green, That's no offense; it's a freedom scene.
The law is specific, the law is precise. Prayers spoken aloud are a
serious vice. For praying in a public hall Might offend someone with
no faith at all. In silence alone we must meditate, God's name is
prohibited by the state. We're allowed to cuss and dress like freaks,
And pierce our noses, tongues and cheeks. They've outlawed guns,
but FIRST the Bible. To quote the Good Book makes me liable. We can
elect a pregnant Senior Queen, And the 'unwed daddy,' our Senior King.
It's "inappropriate" to teach right from wrong, We're taught that such
"judgments" do not belong. We can get our condoms and birth controls,
Study witchcraft, vampires and totem poles. But the Ten Commandments
are not allowed, It's scary here I must confess, When chaos reigns the
school's a mess. So, Lord, this silent plea I make: Should I be shot;
My soul please take!
