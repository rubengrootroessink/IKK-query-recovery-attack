Darlene,
I have a friend in my Sunday School class who is the Josten's distributor 
here in Dallas. This is the company that makes class rings. He will sell me a 
class ring at cost! (How 'bout that?) So, if you will get the info from your 
friend about her daughter (ring size, school, name, etc) I will get her a 
ring. I don't know that I can afford gold, but I can silver, if that is ok. 
If we want gold, we could maybe pool some money. The cost of a gold ring is 
$175 vs $75 for silver. Anyway, just let me know as soon as you can so that I 
can get it ordered. I'm not sure on the delivery time, but we do need to get 
moving on it so that she can enjoy it before the school year is over.
 
Blessings!
Kent
