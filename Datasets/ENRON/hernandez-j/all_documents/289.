	It's Thanksgiving. Put down the turkey. Stop watching football. And learn a 
little about the holiday you're celebrating today at Plimoth.org. If the 
Library section is causing you to read too much, then swing on over to the 
Plantation section and just scroll through some cool pictures. Done? Good - 
you're just in time for some pumpkin pie. www.plimoth.org

	At one time, the turkey and the bald eagle were both considered America's 
national symbol. Benjamin Franklin was pro turkey, and felt it was a better 
choice than the bald eagle, which he felt was "a coward." For more, click

	Thought For Today: "As you live, believe in life. Always human beings will 
live and profess to greater, broader and fuller life. The only possible death 
is to lose belief in this truth." - W.E.B. Du Bois, author and reformer 
(1868-1963).
