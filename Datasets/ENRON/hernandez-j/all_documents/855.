Hi Juan

Per my previous e:mail below we have now assigned you your second requested 
intern (per Kevin Presto's earlier request to John Lavorato).    These Inters 
were on Kevin  Presto's actual selection of candidates for his world.   Their 
names as per the attached spreadsheet:   I believe you will have Andrews 
resume as earlier sent, and I will forward you Joseph's today.

Joseph Spector    Start date:   June 4th
Andrew Kandolha  Start date:  May 21st

The A&A Program will be in contact with your assistant to set up appropriate 
systems etc.
