Subject: Southeast Curves

There are currently three Southeast curves being marked:
R3 - Serc
R3A - Florida/Georgia Border
R3C - Into FRCC

When trading at one of these points please enter the deals as Eastern 
Prevailing Time.  Peak = HE 0800 to HE 2300.

We will change all deals that are live in the system as of last night.  If 
you have any questions, please give myself or Mitzie Scott a call.

Thanks,
Stacey (3-1870)
