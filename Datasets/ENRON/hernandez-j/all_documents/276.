I have a praise report to share.  
 I was touched as was everyone else who read the prayer request for Kat.   I 
delivered my donation to Darlene by hand  because she is on the floor below 
me.  I believe the Lord gave me an amount to give and I was obedient (my mind 
was saying you shouldn't!  You will need this money yourself!)   I believe 
because I was obedient the Lord has blessed me.   Luke 6:38 " Give and it 
shall be given good measure , pressed down, shaken together and running over 
shall men give unto your bosom.  For with the same measure you mete it shall 
be measured again unto you."    I believe that the new testament church 
operated the way we Christians are supposed to.    Helping each other and 
manifesting the love of God.
To make a long story kinda short.   The Lord use a seemingly awful situation 
to  work out for good.  My son missed his airplane back to school.  We spent 
the whole day Sunday in the airport on standby trying to get a flight on 
overbooked airplanes.   He ended up having to wait for a flight this Monday 
to get back to school on time.  It was urgent that he be back before 3:00 
today.   I paid additional money to book him on a flight that had an 
available seat leaving a t 10:00 am this morning. The flight  would arrive 
too late but was the only thing we could obtain.     One of the agents was 
led of the Lord, I believe,  to help us and told us to get to the airport at 
5: 00 this morning and get  on the stand-by list for the 6:00am  flight which 
was also overbooked,  and maybe my son had a chance of getting on.   We did 
as she said and sure enough he was able to get on board and get to his 
destination at 12:45 today. (My son said to me "Mom lets pray that I will be 
able to get on this flight" as we passed through security to get to the 
boarding gate).     Praise the LORD!   The gate person gave him a real ticket 
for a real seat when he gave his name at the gate.  The story does not end 
there.   Another flight person taking the luggage remembered us from the 
previous day , found that we had been bumped the day before even though my 
son had been number 1 in line to get a seat on the next flight out .  This 
woman gave us back the money I had to pay for rescheduling the flight , PLUS 
A FREE ROUND TRIP TICKET TO ANYWHERE WE WANT TO GO! 
 PRESSED DOWN SHAKEN TOGETHER AND RUNNING OVER!!!!   IT IS TRULY MORE BLESSED 
TO GIVE THAN TO RECEIVE.  We can't out give God!  
Blessings,
Juanita

Hello sunshine.  How are things ?  I must say the Lord has really been 
blessing me and my family.  Tell all the prayer warriors I said Thank you.  
There's no way Thank you is enough. I cannot believe the out pour of help 
that came my way.  My load has been lifted considerably, I have a smile on my 
face.  Our God is an awesome God.  He reign's from Heaven about with power 
and love, our God is an awesome God.  I have gotten so many card and letters 
it is unbelievable.  I am so overwhelmed by all of this I can't help but to 
cry.  When people don't even know you they come to your rescue. The Lord is 
going to Bless each and every one of them richly.  Tell all of them I said I 
love them with love of the Lord.  If there is anything I can ever do please, 
please call on me.  The Lord is going to Bless me to be in a position one 
day, I can help someone it is just a matter of time.  And for you Darlene - I 
Love You.  You have always showed concern for me and my family, even when you 
were having problems yourself.  I just Love You!!! May the Lord continue to 
Bless you and your family abundantly. Can I send an e-mail to the saints, the 
one I have their name?  Let me know.  Keep me on your prayer list I will be 
going to the doctor, that always makes me a wreck.  Also, have you heard 
anything about lil Michael?  I want to know how he is doing, I am so sure the 
Lord pulled him though. Please let me know.  I will write again tomorrow, my 
son just walked in I do not want my kids to know my situation, they do not 
need stress, especially him.   I Love you all.

Be Blessed in Jesus Name.
Kat
