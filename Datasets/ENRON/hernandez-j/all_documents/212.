	Many believe the potato chip was born in 1853 in a restaurant in Saratoga 
Springs, N.Y. when a picky customer complained about the thickness of his 
fried potatoes. When the potatoes were returned to wise guy cook, George Crum 
he sliced some potatoes as thinly as possible, fried them and sent them back 
to the customer. To his surprise the man loved them. For more, click here.

	The Long Hack Veil
	Jennifer visited a psychic of some local repute. 
	
	In a dark and hazy room, peering into a crystal ball, the mystic delivered 
grave news: 
	
	"There's no easy way to say this, so I'll just be blunt - prepare yourself to 
be a widow. Your husband will die a violent and horrible death this year." 
	
	Visibly shaken, Jennifer stared at the woman's lined face, then at the single 
flickering candle, then down at her hands. She took a few deep breaths to 
compose herself. 
	
	She simply had to know. She met the fortune teller's gaze, steadied her 
voice, and asked: 
	
	"Will I be acquitted?"
