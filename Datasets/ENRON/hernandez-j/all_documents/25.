Please take time between now and year's end to check the Vacation hours 
balance you have in the SAP system.   If there is a discrepancy, please ask 
HR to correct, and keep me advised should you need time sheet copies.

Carolyn usually has to approve reports at year end (or Jan-2001) for Vacation 
carry-over, so it helps if we are sure of our hours prior to her receiving 
this report.

thanks everyone,
Sandy
