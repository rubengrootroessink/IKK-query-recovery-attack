I don't know if this is on the up and up, but its better to be aware.

 Please be extremely careful when you leave work and if at all
possible, do not leave alone when it gets late. A woman leaving work was
kidnapped yesterday at 6:30 from Lamar between the El Paso Bldg. and
Dynegy.  They drugged her but it appears that there was no rape.... the
police told her that about a month ago another girl downtown was also
kidnapped and raped ... so, please be careful!!!!!!!!

Please pass this on to your friends who work downtown.
