Cool Site of the Day

 


The New York Review of Books may be a bit too pretentious for some, but it's 
more than worth plodding through for its literary value. The magazine's got a 
long list of contributors who've all made a huge mark on the world of letters 
- Norman Mailer, Saul Bellow and Truman Capote, to name a few. Another 
highlight is the caricatures gallery by the journal's artist, David Levine. 
And finally, for those looking to avoid online booksellers' "book 
suggestions" that are just thinly-veiled advertisements, you'll find a 
plethora of genuine recommendations here. Read on. www.nybooks.com

Joke of the Day

 Out of the Mouths of Babes


A first grade teacher collected well known proverbs. She gave each
child in her class the first half of a proverb and asked them to come 
up with the remainder of the proverb. Their insight may surprise you.

Better to be safe than....................Punch a 5th grader

It's always darkest before............... Daylight Savings

You can lead a horse to water but.........how?

Don't bite the hand that................. looks dirty

If you lie down with dogs, you'll.........stink in the morning

Happy the bride who.......................gets all the presents

Don't put off till tomorrow what..........you put on to go to bed

Children should be seen and not...........spanked or grounded

You get out of something what you.........see pictured on the box

And the favorite...

Better late than..........................pregnant
