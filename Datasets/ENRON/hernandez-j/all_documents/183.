=09=09Attaching Files to E-Mail =20
=09=09
=09=09Readers wrote in saying they thought attaching WAVs to e-mail was a g=
reat=20
idea, but how do you do it? It's easy! First you have to save the WAV in a=
=20
folder, which you can name "My Sounds" or "WAV Files" or "Funny Noises."=20
Create the appropriate folder, and then save the sound file in it. To do=20
that, go to the Web page, click on the file you want to save, and choose=20
"Save this file to disk." Navigate to your sound folder and click "save."=
=20
When you're ready to attach it to an e-mail, open a new message and, in=20
Outlook, choose Insert-File (or click the paper clip icon). In Netscape the=
=20
attach button and the paper clip icon are on the same button -- other e-mai=
l=20
programs, like Eudora, have similar features. Just navigate to the folder=
=20
with all your sounds in it, and click the one you want to add. You can't ma=

viruses hide their true file extension. You open a seemingly harmless=20
attachment, and you've got the virus. It's too late to be careful once your=

machine is destroyed!
