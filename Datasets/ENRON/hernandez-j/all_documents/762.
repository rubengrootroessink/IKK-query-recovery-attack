From now on, the ercot load applet/application is located on the file server 
(M Drive) rather than running locally from the client PC.  
There are 2 ways to run the applet/application


1) As desktop application

Create an Desktop ShortCut which points to the following file

  M:\Fundamental Analysis\Development\Ercot\sercot.jar

     ( Or simply COPY the "Ercot RT Load" shortcut (under M:\Fundamental 
Analysis\Development\Ercot\) and PASTE it to your desktop)

2) As browser applets

 http://wnahou-000832/ercot.html

      ( if you never visit the site before,  you need to setup security 
certification. call me (x39865) and I can install it for you) 


Let me know if anyone have any problems.

Thanks,
--a.w.
