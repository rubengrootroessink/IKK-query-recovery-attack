Please see my comments in red below. Thanks - Bill Rust

Transmission Scenarios for MDEA

What would the following procedures be for MDEA's network services.

1.	Buying megawatts from the market and bringing in from outside of Entergy.
a.	Ex.  AEP-TVA-EES-MDEA
For day-ahead (or earlier), put in a network request (designated resources) on the Entergy OASIS, POR=TVA, POD=EES, SOURCE=AEP, SINK=MDEA, BID PRICE = $0.0.  The request will be subject to interface availability and will be evaluated by Entergy accordingly.

2.	Buying megawatts from the market inside of Entergy.  
a.	Ex.  Lagen- MDEA
For day-ahead (or earlier), put in a network request (designated resources) on the Entergy OASIS, POR=LAGN, POD=EES, SOURCE=(LAGN UNIT NAME), SINK=MDEA, BID PRICE = $0.0.  The request will be subject to availability and will be evaluated by Entergy accordingly. (If the source is an Entergy unit (or AXIA) use POR=EES. 

3.	Using the network services request number for the Sepa contract when Sepa is not flowing and we can bring MGW's in from the Tva border.
a.	Ex.  We find 11 MGW's  LGE-TVA-EES-MDEA.
For day-ahead (or earlier), put in a network request (designated resources) on the Entergy OASIS, POR=TVA, POD=MDEA, SOURCE=LGE, SINK=MDEA, BID PRICE = $0.0. Put a comment in the request that states this request is modifying (displacing) the existing request (SEPA; OASIS #851472). - I need to clarify this with Entergy but this is the approach I recommend.

NOTE: When scheduling on the above requests, the transmission is considered F-7 priority level. When you want to schedule intra-day (hourly), you must request non-firm (import for Native/NST loads. This type of transmission is NN-6 priority level.
Remember - all bid prices are $0.0 because MDEA is charged by their load share ratio.

This is all of the scenarios that I can think of that may cause a problem.  I just want to make sure that everyone is on the same page especially with Entergy Transmission.
