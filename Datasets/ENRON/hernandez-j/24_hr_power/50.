Dear juan,

FriedWire Inc has just released a new version of our Traffic Report.  Below 
is a snapshot of the new content:


NEW EMERGENCY MAPS-
We have added more than a hundred transmission elements (e.g. flowgates, 
transformers, power plants now totaling over 500!)
to our geographic representation of TLR's and other market-moving 
announcements.  To handle the increased resolution, we
have developed two new maps that replace the Emergency Constraints map, 
providing even more information for users to easily
digest in a color-coded, geographic snapshot.

Now, the Emergency (TLR) map shows the entire U.S. with small white dots in 
the background that represent all the flowgates
that are experiencing satisfactory conditions.  Overlaid are larger 
color-coded dots signaling the flowgates that have some
TLR level associated with them.  The new TLR map will have greater 
differentiation than the old one, with TLR levels from 1
to 6 represented.  When you click on one of the colored dots, you will see 
the name of the element and the TLR level in a
pop-up box.  The Market Notices map still has the regions colored when there 
is a market notice associated with them.  You
can click on a region and get a pop-up text box with the full text of the 
regional notice.


CALIFORNIA ISO-
We have added the ability to look at the system frequency for a day or an 
hour in the Frequency Monitoring in WSCC
(deviation from 60Hz) area of the System Summary page.

We have also added Generator Outages in California.  This lists all generator 
outages, including unplanned and planned, with
additional data fields detailing the name, owner, and zone of curtailed units 
plus the amount of capacity affected.


POWER FLOWS-
We now have more information displayed on the time series flow graph for each 
intertie on the Intertie Profile screen under
the Power Flows tab.

When a transmission line or intertie is affected by a TLR request, the black 
line on the time series graph (which represents
flow under normal conditions) is overlaid with a bold color corresponding to 
what TLR the line is experiencing.  Thus, the
historical context provided by the graph for intertie flow over the past day, 
week, month, or year, is even more intuitive
and informational with the help of easy-to-read color coding, reflecting TLR 
history as far back as a year.  If you want
more information about the intertie's past TLR's, simply scroll down to the 
history of market notices associated with that
physical transmission element.

We have also revisited the ways in which flow direction can be interpreted.  
We now provide a clear picture of the magnitude
AND direction of power.

1.)  In the power flow time series graph, the limit of the intertie and the 
flow on the intertie will now always show
consistent signs.

2.)  In the Power Flow Data table above the graph, the Flow MW will always 
appear positive.  This flow magnitude is in fact,
the absolute value of the flow.  The Flow Direction, the left-most data field 
on this row, is dynamic.  If the flow changes
directions, the text within that field will be modified accordingly.

3.)  The third place to get an immediate and intuitive sense of direction of 
power flow is in the map to the left of the
graph on the Intertie Profile.  The arrow will always correspond to real-time 
direction of power flow.

Look forward to a major new release soon.  We'll soon be rolling out links to 
all OASIS nodes in our ATC tab, our new
flowgate impact calculator and more.

Take Care,

Bill Townsend
President
FriedWire Inc.
