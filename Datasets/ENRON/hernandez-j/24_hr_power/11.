Juan,

 Your EnronOnline user ID and password is as follows:

User ID: EOL60329
Password: WELCOME!

Please note that the User ID and password will need to be in all upper case.

Just a reminder, in order to access EnronOnline, shockwave needs to be 
installed.  The shockwave installer can be found within "About EnronOnline" 
on the home page.  After opening "About EnronOnline", using right scroll bar, 
go to the bottom.  Click on "download shockwave" and follow the directions.  
After loading shockwave, shut down and reopen browser, i.e. Microsoft 
Internet Explorer, Netscape.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or problems getting 
into the system.

Thanks,
Griff Gray
