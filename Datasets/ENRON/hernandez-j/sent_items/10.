Is  this truly documented?  Can anyone advise?
Nostradamus'  prediction on WW3:
       "In the year of  the new century and nine months,
       From  the sky will come a great King of  Terror...
       The sky will burn at  forty-five degrees.
       Fire approaches the  great new city..."
       "In the city of york  there will be a great collapse,
       2 twin  brothers torn apart by chaos
       while the  fortress falls the great leader will  succumb
       third big war will begin when  the big city is burning"
       -  NOSTRADAMUS
       He said this will be  bigger than the previous two.
       2001 is  the first year of the new century and this is the 9th  
        month.
       New York is located at the 41st  degree Latitude.
