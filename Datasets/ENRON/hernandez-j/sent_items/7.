Everyone,
 
There has been a major shakeup at TRW.  I have always  worked for TRW Automotive Electronics.  Well, we just got told that we TRW  AE has been dissolved and no longer exists.  I support the Safety  & Security, along with some Body Control plants.  Well, now I am  supposed to be going to the division known as Occupant Safety Systems (Airbags  & Seatbelts).  I am not sure what is going to  happen........
