Mike,

We will be leaving Oct. 4 and returning Oct. 7.  You just need to get to
H-town and we will fly you up to Vegas.  We will be staying at the Paris
Hotel.  There will be golfing, catching a show or a day at the spa.  Let
me know as soon as you can.  We'll get the formal invitations out as soon as we can
