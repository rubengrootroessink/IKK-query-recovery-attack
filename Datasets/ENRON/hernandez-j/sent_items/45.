I know you guys have done some of these things.


YOU KNOW YOU ARE AT A "SERIOUS" LATINO BIRTHDAY PARTY IF:

 > 1. Some of the guests didn't bring a gift, but brought extra uninvited
 > kids.
 > 2. When the cake says "Happy Birthday, Mijo" instead of the child's real
 > name.
 > 3. The party is at Chuck E. Cheese but they bring their own food,
 > cake, and a pi?ata.
 > 4. It's a child's party but there are more grown-ups than kids.
 > 5. It's "Mijo's" 1st Birthday and the party food is carne asada,
 > arroz con frijoles y 10 cases of Beer.
 > 6. Instead of "Pin the tail on the donkey", there is usually a
 > televised baseball, football or basketball game, or a live fight.
 > 7. They don't sing Happy Birthday. Instead everyone is dancing salsa.
 > 8. The party was "over" at 5. It's 10 and the party is just starting.
 > 9. The host calls someone who's on their way and tells them to stop
 > and get some tortillas and ice.
 > 10. The guests start arriving and the hostess disappears to get ready.
 > 11.The party is on Saturday, and you get a call from the hostess
 > Friday night saying, "I'm giving Mijo a birthday party tomorrow at 3."
 > 12.Some guests bring gifts that are still in the store bag, unwrapped.
 > 13. You have the party over at your brother's because he just bought
 > a new house, with a pool.
 > 14.The cake didn't come from the store; it came from the mother of
 > the comadre of your friend's sister, the one who makes really good
 > cakes.
 > 15.You're told to save your plate and fork for the cake.
 > 16.Someone calls and says they can't make it, but asks that you to
 > save them some cake.
 > 17.Guests are wrapping up cake to take to Madre, Tio, Abuela, Chata y
