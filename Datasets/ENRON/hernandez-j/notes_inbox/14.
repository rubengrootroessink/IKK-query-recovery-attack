	Wanna create a really distorted, scary and downright ugly face by clicking a 
few buttons? Of course you do! Then check out the FaceGenerator, a cool new 
"appliance" for your browser. The site generates faces, while you get to 
twist, turn and screw them up to your heart's content. By choosing different 
options (like "Stretch" or "Distance"), you manipulate the image one click at 
a time, exactly as you choose. You can also send along your new face to 
friends with the convenient E-send feature. Fun stuff! www.facegenerator.com
