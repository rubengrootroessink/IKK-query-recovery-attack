	Once you've visited PatSajak.com, you can say you've seen everything. That's 
right - the riveting Wheel of Fortune host finally has his own site. We've 
all been waiting, sweating, biting our collective lip for this day to come 
and now it has arrived. So, you ask, what is the first thing I'm greeted with 
when I arrive? A Flash animation of Pat's smilin' mug. Click it once and 
you're in the middle of the challenging PatPuzzle, wherein you can rearrange 
the man's face (in the nice way). Then read Pat's newsletter which is 
chock-full of late-breaking headline news, a section dedicated to Pat's talk 
show (which is suspect, considering it lasted roughly 4 minutes on the air), 
find out how to make your big break by becoming a Wheel contestant, and learn 
about Pat's many many side projects. The web at its most compelling.

	Thought For Today: "Hatred comes from the heart; contempt from the head; and 
neither feeling is quite within our control." - Arthur Schopenhauer,
