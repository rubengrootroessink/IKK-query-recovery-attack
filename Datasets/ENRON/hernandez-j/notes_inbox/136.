Do you need ink AGAIN?  There's so much great stuff out here on the web,
that you want to print and share, but you think of how much it's going
to cost you for those ink cartridges or refills and you hesitate...no
more reason to hesitate!!  You can get affordable ink cartridges and
refills on the internet for much lower than you pay in a retail office
supply store...just check out the folks at Mr Inkman!!

I just found a really neat site that I hope you'll all check out.  With
the holidays coming up it has a great idea for that person you don't
know what to get...but someone you think is the greatest.  It's called
Unsung Hero and I know we all have one of those in our lives..check this
out and see what they have to offer.  I ordered one today!!
