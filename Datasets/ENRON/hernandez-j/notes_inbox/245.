Just to recap in writing....

When you are tracking faxed M-Deals, if you come across those that are not in 
Tagg or are in Tagg with an incorrect status, keep track of these numbers, 
email them to me and send the physical copy back to Laurel, not to Melissa. 
Please email these to me each day and I will email them to Laurel and 
Carolyn.  

Thanks for your help!
