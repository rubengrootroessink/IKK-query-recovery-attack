=09=09For years now, public TV and other education-oriented broadcasters, l=
ike the=20
History Channel and Discovery Channel, have given their viewers Web address=
es=20
where they can go to get more information on the program's topic. This is a=
=20
great idea, and not just because it'll help you get your homework done. If=
=20
you're inclined to watch "educational" TV in the first place, you probably=
=20
need no coaching to pursue topics you find interesting. These sites are gre=
at=20
places to start. They often list links and other resources. They're also=20
great for the morning after, when you're discussing what you watched last=
=20
night with your friends and co-workers. If you can't remember a certain=20
thing, or if anything is in dispute, a quick click or two will take care of=
=20
things. After all, the Internet is the ultimate argument-solver.
