InfoBeat Alerts - An Update from InfoBeat


*** An Update From InfoBeat

Dear Valued InfoBeat Subscriber:

We sincerely apologize for any service disruption or inconvenience
you may have experienced recently with your InfoBeat service.
Over the past few months, we have been making important upgrades
to many parts of our publishing system.  Unfortunately, the final
set of upgrades, which we have been working on over the past few
weeks, has caused some unanticipated disruptions to the InfoBeat 
service.

The InfoBeat engineering team worked around the clock this past
Thanksgiving weekend to implement changes that will prevent such 
situations from occurring in the future.  We very much appreciate 
your continued patience as we make some final enhancements which, 
when completed, will result in an InfoBeat service that is better 
than ever.

Thank you for your continued support which has helped InfoBeat grow 
to be a service with over 8 million subscribers, each receiving 
personalized news every day.  We greatly appreciate your patience 
as we finish our upgrades that will make InfoBeat even better for 
every one of you.  

If you have any questions or comments, please visit our Feedback 
page at www.infobeat.com, or email us at feedback@infobeat.com.

Sincerely,


Mark Wachen
CEO, Indimi/General Manager, InfoBeat
