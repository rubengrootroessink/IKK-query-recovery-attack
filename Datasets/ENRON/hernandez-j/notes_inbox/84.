Hi!  I just thought I would give an update on Stacey.  She is doing 
great!!!!!!!!  She finally got to eat solids today!  Yes, she still has her 
trachea in, but when she is capped, she can eat and talk.  And believe me, 
she is making up for lost time with both of those.  She was so happy to eat 
today.  She had some finely chopped chicken, mashed potatoes and gravy, and 
macaroni and cheese.  She was elated!  It was really fun to watch her.  She 
is feeding herself but only with her left hand.  Her right arm is still 
messed up.  The bone has come loose from the socket at the shoulder and the 
muscles have stretched.   They are working on trying to get it back in 
shape.  She can move it sometimes, but is in pain almost all the time.  She 
is cussing and discussing many things.  She has decided that it is time to go 
home and gets pretty upset when she is told no (so what else is new?).  She 
will be going to the opthomologist next week - to his office.  I am so 
excited that she will actually get to go somewhere.  We will go in the 
hospital van so they can help with her wheelchair.  She is still seeing 
double in her left eye at times.  She said she was seeing two mommies today.  
I asked her if one of them was skinny.  She said "No".  I said "then both are 
fat?".  She said, "They aren't fat, they're just overweight".  She teases a 
lot and remembers most of what we ask.  Her short term memory isn't very 
good.  She has trouble remembering the nurses names but reads their name tag 
instead.  Yes, she can read some things but not everything.  Some names and 
words throw her off.  She doesn't remember the accident.  The doctor said she 
wouldn't remember the accident and probably wouldn't remember one to two 
months prior to the accident.  She is still having trouble remembering what 
month it is but can remember that it is the year 2000.  I bought her a cheap 
watch today and she is able to tell the time most of the time.  Her progress 
is wonderful and I am so excited watching her.  We don't think we'll be home 
for Christmas, but think it will be some time in January.  We are planning to 
have Christmas at the hospital.  I told her it doesn't matter where, just 
that we are together; she seem okay with that.
Well, I need to go to bed.  A chance to sleep on my own bed is a luxury.  I 
miss John beside me.  He is going to Corpus on Mon. and Wed. night when I am 
coming home.  We pass on the freeway and call each other on the phone.  One 
time we stopped at the same Exxon to get gas and necked at the gas pumps.  
I'm sure people were wondering about us.  I get to see him on the weekends, 
but I miss spending time with him and David.  Sharon is coming home on her 
days off and spending as much time with Stacey as she can.  She will be here 
over the Christmas and New Year holidays.  She is thinking about moving back 
home to be closer to Stacey but isn't sure about it yet.  
Please,  send me your phone number and address.  We can't find our address 
book and I stupidly erased everything in my mailbox last week.  My brain is 
turning into mush.
Hope to hear from you soon.  My love to all.  I miss you and love you much!
Carolyn
