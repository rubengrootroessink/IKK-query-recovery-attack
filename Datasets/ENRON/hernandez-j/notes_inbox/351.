Cool Site of the Day

 


Adam Sandler's new movie, "Little Nicky," hits theaters this weekend and it 
turns out it's a 19th Century British period piece. Just kidding. To get the 
skinny on the flick, head over to its devil-themed Web site. Download screen 
savers and desktop wallpaper, watch the trailer, play Devil's Hangman and 
read up on the cast, crew and storyline. Nice looking and lots of fun, this 
site would make Little Nicky very proud. www.littlenicky.com

Fact of the Day

 


In 1921, an unknown World War I American soldier was buried in Arlington 
National Cemetery while similar ceremonies were also held in England and 
France. These memorial services all took place on Nov. 11 to commemorate the 
anniversary of the end of World War I (Nov. 11, 1918). This day of 
remembrance became known as Armistice Day and on June 1, 1954, the name was 
changed to Veterans Day to honor all U.S. veterans. For more, click here.

Joke of the Day

 


*** Starbuckaroo  

The gal was in a coffee shop, surveying the establishment's menu. After 15 
minutes, the counter guy got impatient.  

"How about this?" he asked, jabbing his finger at the menu item, "latte."  

"Nooo," said the blond slowly, "I need to have it early."

Quote of the Day

 


Thought For Today: "Let the world know you as you are, not as you think you 
should be, because sooner or later, if you are posing, you will forget the 
pose, and then where are you?" - Fanny Brice, actress and singer (1891-1951).
