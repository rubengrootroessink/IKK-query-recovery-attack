And God said, "Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding
seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit," and God saw that it was
good.

And Satan said, "There goes the neighborhood."

And God said, "Let us make Man...

And so God created Man in his own image; male and female created
he them. And God looked upon Man and Woman and saw that they were lean
and fit.

And God populated the earth with broccoli and cauliflower and
spinach, green and yellow vegetables of all kinds, so Man and Woman
would live long and healthy lives.

And Satan said, "I know how I can get back in this game."

And Satan created McDonald's. And McDonald's brought forth the
99-cent double cheeseburger.

And Satan said to Man, "You want fries with that?"

And Man said, "Supersize them." And Man gained 5 pounds.

And God created the healthful yogurt, that woman might keep her
figure that man found so fair.

And Satan brought forth chocolate. And Woman gained 5 pounds.

And God said, "Try my crispy fresh salad."

And Satan brought forth Ben and Jerry's. And Woman gained 10
pounds.

And God said, "I have sent thee heart-healthy vegetables and olive
oil with which to cook them."

And Satan brought forth chicken-fried steak so big it needed its
own platter.

And Man gained 10 pounds and his bad cholesterol went through the
roof.

And God brought forth running shoes and Man resolved to lose those
extra pounds.

And Satan brought forth cable TV with remote control so Man would
not have to toil to change channels between ESPN and ESPN2. And Man
gained another 20 pounds.

And God said, "You're running up the score, Devil."

And God brought forth the potato, a vegetable naturally low in fat
and brimming with nutrition.

And Satan peeled off the healthful skin and sliced the starchy
center into chips and deep-fat fried them. And he created sour cream
dip also.

And Man clutched his remote control and ate the potato chips swaddled
in cholesterol.

And Satan saw and said, "It is good." And Man went into cardiac
arrest.

And God sighed and created quadruple bypass surgery.

And Satan created HMO's.
