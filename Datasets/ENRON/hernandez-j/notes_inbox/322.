>  Recently on Inside Edition there was an article about several
> new scams to abduct women.
>
>  In one, a man comes up to a woman in a Mall or Shopping Center and asks
>   if she likes pizza.  When she says she does, he offers her $10000 to
> shoot a
>   commercial for Pizza, but they need to go outside where the lighting is
>   better.  When the woman goes out of the mall she is abduct and
> assaulted.
>
> Another ploy is a very nicely dressed man asks a woman if she would be in
>  a Public Service announcement to discourage drug use.  The man explains
> that
> they don't want professional actors or celebrities; they want the average
> mother to do this. Once she leaves the mall she is a victim.
>
>  The third ploy, the most successful, a frantic man comes runningin to the
>  mall and asks a woman to please help him, his baby is not breathing.
>  She runs out of the mall following him and also becomes a victim.
>
>  These have been happening in well-lit parking areas, in daylightas well
>  as night time, all over the country. The abductor usually uses a
> van to abduct the woman.
>
>  'Inside Edition' set up a test in a Mall and 10 out of 15 women went out
> of the mall on the Pizza and the PSA scam. And all of them wentout of the
>   mall on the baby scam.  Please pass this along to your friends and
> family
>  as now that it has been shown on nationwide TV there are
>   bound to be copycats of this. The third one, I think, is the scariest.
>   You might resist pizza or becoming a commercial celebrity...but who
> would
>  be able to resist a frantic father asking for help for his child?
> I'm sure that one would get me.
>
>  A woman was shopping at the Tuttle Mall in Columbus.  She came out to her
>  car and saw she had a flat. She got her jack and spare out of the trunk.
> A
>  man in a business suit came up and started to help her. When the tire had
>  been replaced, he asked for a ride to his car on the opposite side of the
>  mall. Feeling uncomfortable about doing this, she stalled for a while,
>  but he kept pressing her.  She finally asked why he was on this side of
>  the mall if his car was on the other.  He claimed he had been talking to
>  friends.  Still uncomfortable, she told him that she had just remembered
>  something she had forgotten to pick up at the mall and she left him
>  and went back inside the mall.  She reported the incident to the
> mall security and they went her car.
>
>              The man was nowhere insight. Opening her trunk, she
> discovered a
> briefcase the man had set inside her trunk while helping her with the
> tire. Inside were
> rope and a butcher knife.  And, when she took the tire to be fixed, the
> mechanic informed her that
> there was nothing wrong with her tire, that it was flat because the air
> had been let out of it.
>
>  I was going to send this to the ladies only, but guys, if you love
>  your mothers, wives, sisters, daughters, etc., you may want to pass
> it on to them, as well.
>
> Send this to any woman you know that may need to be reminded that the
>  world we live in has a lot of crazies in it....better safe than sorry.
>
>  PLEASE BE SAFE AND NOT SORRY! JUST A WARNING TO ALWAYS BE ALERT  AND USE
> YOUR HEAD!!!
>
>  Pass this along to every woman you have access to.  Never let
> your guard down.
>
> SOMETIMES THAT FEELING IN YOUR GUT IS THE VOICE OF GOD. TRUST YOUR
> INSTINCTS!!
