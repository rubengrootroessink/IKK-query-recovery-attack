	"Proof of Life" opens around the country Friday and it had better be good 
because if it's not, it will only live in infamy as "That Movie Where, During 
Filming, Meg Ryan Cheated On Dennis Quaid With Russell Crowe" - and nobody 
wants that. The film's official Web site is cool stuff, highlighting all the 
things about kidnapping and ransom you never thought you'd need to know. It's 
actually a little harrowing, with statistics in red typeface flying across 
the screen like CNN coverage during wartime. Click on individual countries to 
learn about their "K&R" history, and then swing over to the typical goodies 
like trailer, soundtrack info, cast & crew, etc. Good-looking site for a 
movie starring a good-looking couple - just don't think about that part, 
though. www.proofoflife.com
