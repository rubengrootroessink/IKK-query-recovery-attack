You Gotta Have Faith


There was this Christian lady that had to do a lot of traveling for her
business, so she did a lot of flying. Flying made her nervous, so she
always took her Bible along with her to read and it helped relax her.

One time, she was sitting next to a man. When he saw her pull out her
Bible, he gave a little chuckle and went back to what he was doing. After
awhile, he turned to her and asked, "You don't really believe all that stuf=
f
in there do you?"

The lady replied, "Of course I do. It is the Bible."
He said, "Well, what about that guy that was swallowed by that whale?"
She replied, "Oh, Jonah. Yes, I believe that, it is in the Bible."
He asked, "Well, how do you suppose he survived all that time inside the
whale?"

The lady said, "Well, I don't really know. I guess when I get to heaven, I
will ask him."
"What if he isn't in heaven?" the man asked sarcastically.
"Then you can ask him." replied the lady.
