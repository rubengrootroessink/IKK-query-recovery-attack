Happy belated Thanksgiving, everyone.
 
I am sorry to have taken so long to send you this Stacey report. I was down 
in Corpus this past Tuesday and Wednesday and then up to Huntsville for 
Thanksgiving with my folks, and just returned home this afternoon (Saturday).
 
Stacey is OUT of the comma!!!!!!! She emerged from it last Sunday. Needless 
to say, Carolyn and John are just beside themselves. While I was with them on 
Wed. morning, I was able to watch Stacey in her rehab and got to see her 
write her name with her left hand. She also, just before I arrived, said 
"Momma".  Guess What? I have really seem firsthand the miracle that we have 
all been praying for. 
 
I must admit that I was somewhat teary-eyed watching this precious little 
girl do things that no one was sure that she would ever do again.  But, there 
is still a long way to go.
 
Stacey's right arm is just kind of hanging from muscle atrophy. And, it is 
giving her a lot of pain. (The good thing is that now she can tell the 
doctors where the pain is located!) Also, it is going to take several more 
months of rehab before she can go home. So, keep the prayers going.
 
As I entered the room, there was a man there who was leaving. Last December, 
he was in an accident that left him in the same shape as Stacey. But now, he 
is fully recovered. He came to the hospital because he had seen an article in 
the Corpus Christi newspaper about Stacey. He said that he felt that he just 
needed to let the family know that there really is hope and that you really 
can fully recover. WOW! Does God have a sense of timing or what?
 
Carolyn wants everyone to know how much she loves you all and appreciates 
your concern and your prayers. The hospital let them use a large room for 
Thanksgiving Day dinner. They were even going to let Stacey have some of the 
food with them. Talk about a Thanksgiving?
 
Folks, I must tell you that this has been exciting for me to see this miracle 
unfold. I have enjoyed hearing from Carolyn and being able to report these 
things to all of you. I wish that all of you could get to go and see these 
people that we have all prayed for these past few months. It has been quite 
an emotional deal for me to have seen a child that no one was sure would even 
live and now see her awake and recognizing people around her and laughing and 
crying and writing her name. Thanks for what you have done for her through 
your prayers. And thanks for allowing me to send you these updates and to be 
your eyes and ears. But, as I said earlier, we don't stop here. It's not over 
until Stacey is 100%, and she will be! I will stay in touch with Carolyn and 
keep you updated.
 
We do have much to be thankful for this year.  So, let's thank Him who is the 
giver of all the good and perfect gifts, even life itself!
 
Be Blessed!
Kent
