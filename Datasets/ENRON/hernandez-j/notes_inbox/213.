> SPECIAL DELIVERY
>
>      This past spring my wife passed away after a six-month battle with
> colon cancer.
>      She spent two months, last November and December, in a convalescent
> home.  I visited her every day and watched her condition change from bad
> to
> worse, although some days she would rally and seem to have a very good
> day.
> Her spirits rarely faltered as she maintained a cheerful outlook and
> seldom, if ever, complained about anything.
>      Each day, she had a request for some food that she had a craving for.
> These cravings ranged from all varieties of fruit to pizza.  On my visits,
> I always brought what she had requested.  She always had me help her with
> her laps, which consisted of her walking from her hospital bed to one end
> of the hospital corridor and back, once, twice and even three times, on a
> good day.
>      You see, she thought, and I hoped, that she would beat this terrible
> disease.  After New Years, I brought her home and she was very happy being
> in her own bed.  On the 12th of February, she quietly slipped away, with
> my
> daughter, a few close family members and me at her bedside.
>      Now with the holidays fast approaching my thoughts often turn to
> holiday celebrations of the past and my daughter often asks me what are we
> going to do without mom here?
>      The doorbell rang recently, and as I answered the door I was greeted
> by the postman.  He handed me a letter.  It was marked Special Delivery
> and
> as I read the return address, I saw that it was from the convalescent home
> where my wife had stayed.  I signed for the letter and thought to myself
> it
> was nice of someone from the home to remember us at this time of year.
>      There are no words to explain my elation as I took out the folded
> pages from the envelope and began to read the first page:
>
>      Thanksgiving, 1999
>
>      To My Beloved Family,
>
>        I do not know if I will be with you next Thanksgiving or not,
>        but please know that my spirit and my heart will be with you.
>
>        I am reminded this day of all the wonderful holidays that we
>        had together over the years.  Everyone was a precious day
>        to me, especially thinking about them now.  The two of you
>        must be strong and I am sure that you will be.
>
>        Richard, I hope that you decorate the table gaily with a nice
>        tablecloth, fine linen place mats, and our best china and
>        silverware.  Remember the two silver candle holders you
>        gave me on our 25th anniversary?  You could use those as
>        a center piece and maybe you and Tricia could each light
>        one candle as you say what you are thankful for.
>
>        Look in the big Betty Crocker cookbook?  Near the pages
>        on how to prepare a turkey for baking, you will find my
>        grandmother's old recipe and also aunt Clara's recipe for
>        fruit salad.  I am positive between you and Tricia you can
>        put together a dinner fit for a King -- and Queen, which
>        you both are.
>
>        Be assured, that wherever I am, I will in some way be
>        present with you and so you need not feel alone.
>
>        I am writing this from my hospital bed and Karen, the
>        charge nurse, is helping me . I told her to hold this letter
>        for me until next Thanksgiving and then to mail it Special
>        Delivery.
>
>        I must stop now as tears are blurring my vision.  Always
>        know that I love you both and will always be with you on
>        every occasion like this one.  I know that I can be proud
>        of you and that you will have a wonderful day.
>
>        May God and his blessings be with you always,
>                                             Mom
