Cool Site of the Day

 


Mr. Winkle is a real dog who lives in Los Angeles. And like everybody else in 
that city, he's really cute but something's a little off. Check Winkle out 
for yourself at his Web site and see if you agree. The exact breed of this 
phenomenal dog is unknown and the owner is obviously enjoying making money 
off of the fact - calendars, posters and "short films" have been created 
around him and are for sale at the site (naturally). Hear Mr. Winkle pant and 
bark as you roam around, and make sure to get a good, long look - you're not 
likely to see another dog like this ever again. www.mrwinkle.com
