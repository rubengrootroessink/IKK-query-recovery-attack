Subject: Toby & Cindy - new baby

I just received this from my friend. I don't remember who I sent the prayer
request to for the couple having a baby. I thank you for your prayers
though. It is amazing how God will be glorified through this situation.
Kristy


Hey guys -

Thanks for  all the prayers for Toby and Cindy.  Cindy had the baby on
Tuesday and as of last night, Thursday, he was doing well.  He does have
anencephaly.  The back part of his skull is not formed and they don't
know how long he will live.  They are still in the hospital and will probably
remain there.  Toby and Cindy are doing really well and the baby has
touched many lives in the few days he has been here.  His name is Ian 
Christian.
He weighed 5 lbs. 15 ounces and I'm not sure of the length.  I guess nurses
have been coming in wanting to see him and many have cried.  Ian's
pediatrician, which she is from India, asked Toby and Cindy about their
faith because they are doing so well.

My husband and I were talking about this last night and I can't even
imagine going through this; but what about those people that don't know 
Christ as their Personal Savior.  How would they ever get through it?

I'll keep you all up to date.  Toby and Cindy told Ian that he could go
be with Jesus, but as of last night he's still here.  God must still have
some more lives for him to touch before he goes Home.

Keep them in your prayers and thanks for all the prayers, I know they
feel them.

Love to you all - Molly

Subject: Friends needing prayer

Dear Friends - Molly is a dear friend of mine and I know she and her
friends would appreciate your prayers. Pray for God's will in this
situation and His glory. Also for comfort and strength for Toby and Cindy.
Thanks for taking the time to do this. Kristy

MOLLY - I'LL BE PRAYING! KRISTY

From: "Molly Herb" <rmbl20@hotmail.com>

Good Morning:

I need each of you to be in prayer about some friends of ours.  Some of
you already know the situation, but they have asked that we pass the word
along.

They want everyone to be in prayer.

Toby and Cindy are expecting a baby and Cindy will be going in Tuesday
(11/28) to have the baby - c-section.  The baby has Anencephaly which
means, the way I understand it, the baby will be born with only a brainstem 
and no skull bone.  There are other malformations with this - possibly cleft
lip/palate, abnormalities of the hands and/or feet and other internal
malfunctions.  They have know this for quite a while and she has carried
the baby almost full term.  I think her actual due date is 12/10.  The baby
will die.  The way I understand it all babies born with this usually are
stillborn or die within hours or a few days after they are born.

To be truthful, I really don't know what to pray for.  I'm just praying
for comfort and peace for Toby and Cindy and the Lord's Will would be done.
I cannot even imagine what they are going through and we all have so much
to be thankful for.

Toby and Cindy just ask that everyone please be in prayer for them and
specifically pray on Tuesday, the 28th.  She goes to the dr. at 11:30.

There are some websites you can go to for more information.
www.asfhelp.com is a support foundation and there are numerous other websites 
under keyword "anencephaly".

Thanks for the prayers guys.  I know Toby and Cindy will feel them and
appreciate them.

Love all of you - Molly
