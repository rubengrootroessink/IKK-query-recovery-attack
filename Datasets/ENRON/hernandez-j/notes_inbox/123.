	Hollywood Hauntings is a creepy little venture dealing with celebrity 
hauntings, Hollywood ghosts and the like. Although the site is in its 
infancy, there's still plenty of juicy stuff here. Check out the great 
Hauntings section for some helpful cross- referencing - you can browse by 
celebrity involvement, haunted hotels, haunted houses, movie studios and 
curses. Confused by some of the terminology? Then click Glossary for a quick 
primer on terms like 'crisis apparition.' A great links section provides 
added entertainment and a horror movie review section is slowly getting off 
the ground, too. A strange topic, to be sure, but stories on James Dean's 
Porsche and Marilyn Monroe's stay at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel will make 
you want to sleep with the lights on. http://gothic.vei.net/hollywood

	One day inside the Cathedral of Pisa, Galileo Galilei watched a monk draw a 
large chandelier toward himself, light the candles and release it. In the 
chandelier's constant swinging motion Galileo saw the potential for keeping 
time. Although the first proper pendulum clock, created by Christian Huygens, 
was not constructed until after Galileo's death, it was his early theory that 
sparked the invention. For more, click here.
