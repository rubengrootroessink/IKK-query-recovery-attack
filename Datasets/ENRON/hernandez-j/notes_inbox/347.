Cool Site of the Day

 


The absolute height of European cool is the Vespa motor scooter. And those 
who love them REALLY love them - check out Vespa.org and see for yourself. 
How to fix 'em up, serial numbers of old models, tips for long road trips, 
lots and lots of pictures, even a list of international Vespa events. These 
people take their motor-scooterin' quite seriously and their is site is fun 
to cruise around - even if you don't own one. www.vespa.org

with the purchase of two packages of Kellogg's Corn Flakes. The offer ran for 
23 years. For more, click here.
