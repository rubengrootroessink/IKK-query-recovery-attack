=09=09
=09=09It's a good idea to save your favorite sites in your Favorites (Inter=
net=20
Explorer) or Bookmarks (Netscape) files. Sometimes the name of the=20
favorite/bookmark isn't what you want, however -- it might be blank, or in =
a=20
foreign language (like Japanese), or maybe it just says "index" or somethin=
g;=20
or "welcome to BlaahBlah.net, the blah-blahest site on the Net." It's easy =
to=20
give it an easier-to-handle handle. In Favorites, just open Organize=20
Favorites. Your rename button is there with other useful buttons for=20
organizing your bookmarks. In Netscape Bookmarks, just open Edit Bookmarks.=
=20
Highlight the bookmark you want to rename. Right-click to bring up the pop-=
up=20
menu, and select Properties. Just type the new name in the Name box, and th=
en=20
click OK.
