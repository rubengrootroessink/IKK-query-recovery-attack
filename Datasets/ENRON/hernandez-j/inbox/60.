Did you see this one, from the Miami Herald.  It gives me chills. . . and hope.

We'll go forward from this moment


It's my job to have something to say.
They pay me to provide words that help make sense of that which troubles
the American soul. But in this moment of airless shock when hot tears
sting disbelieving eyes, the only thing I can find to say, the only
words that seem to fit, must be addressed to the unknown author of this
suffering.

You monster. You beast. You unspeakable bastard.

What lesson did you hope to teach us by your coward's attack on our
World Trade Center, our Pentagon, us? What was it you hoped we would
learn? Whatever it was, please know that you failed.

Did you want us to respect your cause? You just damned your cause. Did
you want to make us fear? You just steeled our resolve. Did you want to
tear us apart? You just brought us together.


Let me tell you about my people. We are a vast and quarrelsome family, a
family rent by racial, social, political and class division, but a
family nonetheless. We're frivolous, yes, capable of expending
tremendous emotional energy on pop cultural minutiae-a singer's
revealing dress, a ball team's misfortune, a cartoon mouse. We're
wealthy, too, spoiled by the ready availability of trinkets and material
goods, and maybe because of that, we walk through life with a certain
sense of blithe entitlement. We are fundamentally decent,
though-peace-loving and compassionate. We struggle to know the right
thing and to do it. And we are, the overwhelming majority of us, people
of faith, believers in a just and loving God. Some people-you,
perhaps-think that any or all of this makes us weak. You're mistaken. We
are not weak. Indeed, we are strong in ways that cannot be measured by
arsenals.

IN PAIN
Yes, we're in pain now. We are in mourning and we are in shock. We're
still grappling with the unreality of the awful thing you did, still
working to make ourselves understand that this isn't a special effect
from some Hollywood blockbuster, isn't the plot development from a Tom
Clancy novel. Both in terms of the awful scope of their ambition and the
probable final death toll, your attacks are likely to go down as the
worst acts of terrorism in the history of the United States and,
probably, the history of the world. You've bloodied us as we have never
been bloodied before. But there's a gulf of difference between making us
bloody and making us fall. This is the lesson Japan was taught to its
bitter sorrow the last time anyone hit us this hard, the last time
anyone brought us such abrupt and monumental pain. When roused, we are
righteous in our outrage, terrible in our force. When provoked by this
level of barbarism, we will bear any suffering, pay any cost, go to any
length, in the pursuit of justice.

I tell you this without fear of contradiction. I know my people, as you,
I think, do not. What I know reassures me. It also causes me to tremble
with dread of the future. In the days to come, there will be
recrimination and accusation, fingers pointing to determine whose
failure allowed this to happen and what can be done to prevent it from
happening again. There will be heightened security, misguided talk of
revoking basic freedoms. We'll go forward from this moment sobered,
chastened, sad. But determined, too. Unimaginably determined.

THE STEEL IN US
You see, the steel in us is not always readily apparent. That aspect of
our character is seldom understood by people who don't know us well. On
this day, the family's bickering is put on hold. As Americans we will
weep, as Americans we will mourn, and as Americans, we will rise in
defense of all that we cherish. So I ask again: What was it you hoped
to teach us? It occurs to me that maybe you just wanted us to know the
depths of your hatred. If that's the case, consider the message
received. And take this message in exchange: You don't know my people.
You don't know what we're capable of. You don't know what you just
started.

But you're about to learn.
