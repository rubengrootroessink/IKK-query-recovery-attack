Kayne,

In speaking with the Associate / Analyst program today they informed me that you may still have a position open for an associate.  I am in the process of finishing up a rotation on the EBS trading floor and would be interested in speaking with you further if this position is still open.  Please find my attached resume, and I will contact you within the week.

 

Thanks,

Michael Seely
