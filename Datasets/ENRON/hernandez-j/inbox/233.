Commonwealth Edison Company.  ER00-3668-001.  Settlement Issues.  Commonwea=
lth Edison proposed to install equipment at its East Frankfort substation (=
East Frankfort) to accommodate the 138 kV interconnection of University Par=
k's 300 MW peaking generation facility.  Under the agreements, University P=
ark is wholly responsible for the costs of relocating two 345 kV transmissi=
on lines and one 12 kV line at East Frankfort. On November 8, 2000, FERC ac=
cepted and suspended Commonwealth Edison's September 12 agreements, subject=
 to refund and subject to Commonwealth Edison making a compliance filing to=
: 1) set out specific charges for the proposed interconnection of Universit=
y Park's generation facility (together with supporting documentation); and =
2) provide support for the proposed direct assignment of facilities to Univ=
ersity Park.  On June 4, 2000, regarding Commonwealth Edison's revisions to=
 its unexecuted interconnection agreement filed in compliance with FERC's N=
ovember 8 order, FERC: 1) accepted the proposed charge of $900,000 for a T-=
tap connection and $300,000 ($1.2 million) for protective relaying as direc=
tly assignable to University Park; 2) rejected Commonwealth Edison's estima=
ted $9 million for the enhancement of East Frankfort and other changes to t=
he September 12 interconnection agreement not contemplated in the November =
8 order; and 3) rejected Commonwealth Edison's proposed $1.5 million charge=
 related to the line relocation costs, set this matter for hearing, and hel=
d the hearing in abeyance pending settlement discussions between the partie=
s.  On June 12, the Chief Judge issues an order designating a settlement ju=
dge, Judge Jacob Leventhal, and directing him to convene a settlement confe=
rence, to explore the possibility of settlement, to discuss the differences=
 between the parties, and in general to conduct the settlement negotiations=
.  Chief Judge also directs all parties to have persons present at the sett=
lement negotiations with authority to negotiate and accept or approve settl=
ement terms. Chief Judge explains that Judge Leventhal will be available to=
 meet with the parties individually or in groups, in person or by telephone=
 prior to the conference.  Further, he states that a settlement conference =
will convene in a FERC hearing room on June 21, 2001 at 10:00 A.M.
