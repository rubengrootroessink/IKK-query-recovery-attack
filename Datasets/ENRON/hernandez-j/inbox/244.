All indications are positive that New Albany will be sold to Duke Energy.

During this period Kevin Presto will control the dispatch and premium required for N.A. to run. Please ensure that the plant is ready and available at all times so we can catch any premium between now and the time the facility id transferred to Duke Energy. 

Please forward any calls or requests for information from non Enron sources to myself, any time of the day.  

Thanks.
