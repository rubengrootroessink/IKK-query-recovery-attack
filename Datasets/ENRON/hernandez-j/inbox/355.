Juan / Don:

Per our conversation on August 9, my manager, Jeff Sorenson, returned from =
London on Monday (8/27).  Today, Jeff and I discussed our conversation and =
my desire to pursue opportunities within your trading group.  Jeff's positi=
on on my pursuit of other opportunities was positive.  Jeff stated that he =
did not want to prevent me from pursuing my interests within Enron.  If I c=
ompleted the interview process and was given the opportunity to join your g=
roup, Jeff expressed a concern over the desired time period for a transitio=
n and finding additional staff to fill my current responsibilities.  This i=
s not an area that we discussed in detail, thus I informed Jeff that I woul=
d provide him with some additional details.  If the opportunities are still=
 available, I definitely want to pursue them further.  I'll will contact yo=
u on Wednesday to discuss any further details.  If there is a particular ti=
me that is more convenient to talk, please let me know.  Thanks again, and =
I looking forward to meeting with you again.

Best regards,

Jason Berlin
