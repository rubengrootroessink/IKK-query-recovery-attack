    Everyone,
   There has been a major shakeup at TRW.  I  have always  worked for TRW
   Automotive Electronics.   Well, we just got told that we TRW  AE has been
   dissolved  and no longer exists.  I support the Safety  & Security,  along
   with some Body Control plants.  Well, now I am   supposed to be going to
   the division known as Occupant Safety  Systems (Airbags  & Seatbelts).  I
   am not sure  what is going to  happen........
    Laura
