The computer IT group talked to us a while back about making different programs, etc. for Real Time trading.  If you could, talk among yourselves and make a list of things that are (1) broken [like Sahara]  (2) could be improved [? P&L sheet] (3) Ideas for new applications to help speed up the process, etc.

Debra Bailey is going to start listing projects for the 24 Hour group, soon.

Let's get together and discuss them when you can.
