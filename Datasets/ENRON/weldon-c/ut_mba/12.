Hi UT Team - 

We're in a critical time in the recruiting process as offers have been 
extended and we need to make sure they're accepted!  In order to ensure 
cultivation of the UT candidates who received offers, we have assigned each 
of you to a team of candidates to call at least once before the Holidays.  

The teams are designed so there is an executive lead, an experienced Enron 
representative, and/or an associate.  All members of the cultivation team 
should contact each candidate assigned to their team each week.  If the 
executive leads want to develop a more detailed strategy for their 
cultivation team that is fine.  Each week the associate should report to me 
about the candidates on their team, letting me know about any issues or 
concerns.

The deadline for offer acceptance has been extended to January 2nd!  Please 
communicate this to all candidates and make sure to let them know if the 
paperwork is not in our office by January 2nd we will assume they are 
declining.

If you have any questions or do not feel that you have the time to devote to 
this, please let me know so we can replace you.  I really appreciate your 
help!  Don't forget to call everyone at least once before the Holidays, 
because they will be leaving campus for Christmas break soon!
