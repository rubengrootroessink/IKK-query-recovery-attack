All - 

Recruiting season is upon us again.  This should be a fun and (hopefully) fruitful Fall for selling Enron to the UT MBA class of 2002.  There are many events scheduled for the Fall ranging from informal happy hours and a tailgate to the more structured campus presentations and interviews.  Additionally, there will be several opportunities to cultivate relationships with candidates and professors.  Below is a list of important dates.

You may have received this a week ago from Kristin Gandy.  Kristin, who was the recruiter for UT MBA Spring recruiting, has moved to a commercial position within Enron and will no longer be our recruiter.  Taking Kristin's place is Lexi Elliott.  Lexi has recruited with the Associate / Analyst Program for several years.  During this time, Lexi's responsibilities included UT Undergraduate recruiting.   Lexi is familiar with UT, the campus administration, and the logistics for recruiting in Austin.  She will be a great asset for our team.

Do not hesitate to notify Lexi or me about your level of interest and ability to be involved with the Fall effort.  Note that the first event is 10 days away.
