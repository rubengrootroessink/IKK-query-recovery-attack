Charlie - 

I am in an off site vendor meeting this morning and hope to be in the office 
later this afternoon.  Unfortunately, I am out of town on Friday (I am 
actually headed to Austin for a visit).  But could perhaps do something 
Monday morning, if I can't get to the office in time this afternoon.  Let me 
know your availability.  Thanks so much.



Suzette
