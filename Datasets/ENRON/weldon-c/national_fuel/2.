Charlie,

Can you please update the gas price for the National Fuel deal in New York?  Our customer called and would like updated deal economics from us.  This was the one that was NYMEX + INDEX (I think that BASIS was 0), and was on the USA side of the border.  I believe that we dinged the price approx. 5 to 6 cents for that.  In any case, I have attached the form with the relevant information.  Please let me know if you have any questions or need more information.

Thanks,

John
