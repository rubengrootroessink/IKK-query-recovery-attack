Eric and Charlie:

Thanks for your time in meeting with us.  Attached is the information on Unocal.  The minimum required deliverable volumes are based on 40% load factor, and the put is based on 10% above that (volumes between a 40% and a 44% load factor).  

Thanks and please call me if you have any questions.  

Maria
