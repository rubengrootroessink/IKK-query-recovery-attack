Just wanted to run through the final values related to the Citi prepay.  The prepay will fund today by way of Delta (I will forward fed ref numbers for each of the wires and get contact information for the wires).  The final values are as follows:

Net funds in at 6-29-01		$249,500,000	(amount net of $500,000 upfront fees to Citi for arranging the transaction)
Total interest expense		$5,599,028	(interest payable on 12/28/01 as bullet payment upon settle)
Costs of funding		$583,485	(deal was booked at Libor + 60 bps for a six-month deal, consistent with Enron COFs)

Please let me know if you have any questions and thanks for all the help.
