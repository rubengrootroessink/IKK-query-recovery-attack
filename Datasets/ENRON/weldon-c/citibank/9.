The following presentation lays out the structure, responsibilities and timing for the $250 million prepay with Citibank.  This transaction is required to finished by June 29 (quarter-end deal).  We had initial discussions with Citibank yesterday and should have feedback today on some of the key terms.  Please review both the responsibilities and calendar (timing) to make sure the list is complete and the timing is achievable.  Please give me a call with any questions.  Thanks again for all your help.
