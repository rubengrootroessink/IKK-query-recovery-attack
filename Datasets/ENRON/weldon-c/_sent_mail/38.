Attached in Bold are the answers to all the questions except 6 and 8.  The major outstanding issue as of right now is the final determination of specs for the fuel oil from Mitsubishi..

A couple of quick questions about the truck deliveries to the H. D. King Power plant location:

1) Do the delivering trucks need to have their own pumps?   Trucks need pumps.
2) What size lines are the trucks pumping into? 3"?     3"
3) When connecting to our lines do the trucks need anything other than standard fittings?    Standard or 3 inch disconnects

Outstanding issues:

1) Full spec sheet--especially sodium and potassium guarantees    The environmental specs are known but the specs on the turbine itself from Mitsubishi (MHI) are not known.  We cannot determine the final specs unitl the MHI requirements are known.
2) After the initial tank fill delivery availability 24 hours/day and weekends?  Always someone at plant. Can take delivery 24/7.
3) Tank fill and beyond--why not the full 1MM gallons?  Need 200K gallons to replace previously burned oil only.
4) Dyed/non dyed fuel issue--tax evaluating   Dyed
5) Identify previous diesel supplier to the plant   Coastal was previous supplier
6) Design a fuel resupply plan including prepurchase of fuel, call on transportation, buy diesel calls for expected outage periods
7) Buyer of record and credit issues with suppliers   FPUA is buyer of record
8) Tank fill price--fixed or floating? (Platt's, NYMEX, OPIS, rack price)  
9) Commercial start date of plan     Tank to be ready on 5/15/2001
10) Any other issue to be discussed
