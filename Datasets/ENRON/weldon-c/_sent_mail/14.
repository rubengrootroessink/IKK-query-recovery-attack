Greetings,

The folks who are getting this e-mail include state editors, some folks
who have been following the web site closely, and recent posters to our
current message board.

I need your help testing out a new section of the GOPUSA.com web site,
and I hope you will participate.

In the past, GOPUSA.com has not made the proper effort that it should in
promoting its message board.  This is unfortunate, and it's about to
change.  If you notice, despite the fact that GOPUSA.com has not
promoted the board at all, it has received a number of posting over the
last several months.

Now, in our effort to really build a GOPUSA community, we are completely
redesigning the message board!  The new message board is called the
GOPUSA.com Forum.  It uses much better software than we had before, and
it is much more versatile:

* Users will actually register and be assigned a password.  This
password will be sent to them so that e-mail addresses can't be bogus.
The users e-mail address, however, does not have to appear on his/her
posts.
* There is a personal message section on the board in which a registered
user can leave a message for another registered user.
* There is an Announcements section where GOPUSA.com can post new news
and information.
* There are varying levels of "members" depending on how many posts a
user has made.
* There are icons incorporated on the board for many symbols.
* There is a lot more as well...

So, what we need to do is thoroughly test out the board.  My plan is to
launch it with an announcement in the Monday morning edition of the
Eagle.  So we need to do as much testing as we can this week.  Then,
late Saturday or Sunday, I'll clean out all the test messages, and open
it up to you guys to start posting real messages.

Here's what I'd like you to do:

* Go to the GOPUSA.com Forum at
http://gopusa.com/cgi-bin/ikonboard/ikonboard.pl
* Register with the Forum
* You'll get a password which you can easily change to a different
password in your "profile"
* Make some posts to the existing topics.  These posts don't have to be
related to the topic.  We're simply testing at this point.  The post
can, however, contain your opinions about the board, etc.
* Please e-mail me if you can participate in the testing.
* Please e-mail me (and post to the board) your ideas on topics.  A
could place for comparison is http://www.freerepublic.com
* Consider the idea on having state specific categories (a California
section, etc.) or just general categories like I have now.  Please give
me your thoughts on this.
* Test out all the features you can on the board.  If you see graphics
that don't "fit" with the layout, please let me know.  I'm customizing
the graphics to fit the GOPUSA.com theme, but I haven't changed all of
them yet.
* Don't comment on the fact that the links aren't working on the general
GOPUSA.com page that contains the Forum.  This is just a template of the
new layout, and it will be working Monday.

Thank you so much for your help on this.  Time is of the essence, and I
apologize for the late start on this.  It was not the orignial plan.  We
are going to make a big effort to build a GOPUSA community, and I know
the Forum will play a large role.

Take care, and please let me know if you have any questions.

Bobby
