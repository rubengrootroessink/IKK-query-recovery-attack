Karen,

I just wanted to confirm that you received my resume OK.  I just noticed that I  replied to your EGM message you sent out yesterday instead of your ENA Trading Track message that I received Friday.  I just wanted to make sure that you didn't accidentally overlook it due to the wrong subject header.


Thanks,

Charlie
