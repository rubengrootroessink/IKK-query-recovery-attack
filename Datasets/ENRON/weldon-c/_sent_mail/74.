The following response from Doug is intended to address the issue of whether or not the sample taken was representative of what we would expect to recieve in Florida.....per the discussion of such matter in our meeting.

This sample tested by Saybolt was from a shore tank of low sulfur diesel (Colonial 74 grade) in a major's tank in the Houston area. This is representative of the low sulfur diesel that would be shipped to Florida. Fax is on it's way. Any questions call me at x35007.

Doug,

Fax is 646-3460.  A couple folks wanted to know where this sample was taken from.  I told them that I was not exactly sure but was confident that the sample would be representative of the fuel oil that would be delivered in Florida, per our conversation.


Thanks again,

Charlie
