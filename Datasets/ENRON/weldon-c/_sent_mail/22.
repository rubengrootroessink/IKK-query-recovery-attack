Attached is the latest pricing as of Friday's close for the Stagecoach deal.  Load factors have been adjusted per your request to give a 50% minimum.
The new indicative price, applying spreads from previous quotes, is now $4.82.   (Note that the market is off significantly today so this quote will likely be a few pennies higher than one you would get in the live market right now)

Thanks,

Charlie
