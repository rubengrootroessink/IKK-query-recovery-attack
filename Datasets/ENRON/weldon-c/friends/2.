You still headed down this afternoon?  Where are you staying tonight?  I
plan to head down sometime this evening.  I hope to get out of here a little
early but I've got a hearing this am and don't really know what the day will
be like.  Either way, I don't plan on hunting this evening.  If you aren't
staying out at the trailer, I take it that it is ok if I do anyway.

Chris

Looks like my mom will be staying with Paul both nights at the trailer.
I'm sorry for this misunderstanding.  Apparently Paul did not think about
the fact that you may want/need to stay there.

   Anyway,  I've now put the key under the wooden step platform at the
   trailer so you can free access to the trailer whenever you wish
   regardless of anyone being there (absent this weekend obviously).  I
   told Paul I was going to do this so you and Weldon could have this
   access. ( FYI - Previously, Weldon only stayed there when one of us was
   there.)  There is a slight chance that my mom and Paul may want to use
   the trailer later in the season for a weekend with my sister's kids but
   nothing is planned currently.  That's about the only other scenario I
   can see where it will not be available.

   As I mentioned my plans currently are to hunt:

   Fri, Nov 9th pm - Sun, Nov 11th pm  ((Some decent rutting activity)
   Fri Nov 16th pm - Mon, Nov 19th pm  (Rut should be full tilt here)
   Fri Nov 23rd pm - Sun, Nov 25th am  (May not get to hunt this weekend)

   I should be staying at the trailer most, but not all, of those nights as
   Melissa will likely stay in Cuero some of those nights and I 'll need to
   help her out with the kiddos a night or two.  We'll see.

   As for opening weekend, looks like the weather will be OK.  This past
   weekend, I saw several does and 3 small bucks.  Paul saw a 3.5-4.5 yr
   old 16" 8 pt that was OK but not a shooter.  The young bucks are trying
   to start chasing but that's not uncommon. There still are not an
   abundance of rubs so I now the rut is not about th launch.  I would say
   that the peak rut may be a bit earlier this year but should still be
   somewhere between the 10th and 25th of Nov.  I cannot stress enough how
   important it is to concentrate your hunting during this period.  Chances
   of seeing a large buck at a feeder after Nov 30th are quite a bit lower.

   Let me know what your plans are whenever you make them.


   Good Luck,

   Charlie
