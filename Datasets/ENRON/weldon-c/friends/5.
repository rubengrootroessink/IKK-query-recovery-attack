I saw a Money news commentator on yesterday morning, a  woman,  she said that the people who invested in the stock market in late  99 through the uprise of the market in 2000 will have to wait decades  for  the market to reach those levels again.  What do you think?  It came  on a 5 yesterday morning, the channel, the name of the woman I do not  know.
