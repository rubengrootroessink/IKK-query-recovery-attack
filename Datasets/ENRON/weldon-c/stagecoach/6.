Andrew,  Attached is a draft of the Master Firm/Purchase between EES and ECS 
and its accompany Transaction Agreement.  I think it does make sense to have 
a separate agreement to encompass the overall annual true between the power 
and gas sides.  Need to discuss this with EES' attorney.  I will contact Bo 
and see who is the lead attorney on this deal.   Please review the attached 
documents and let me know before you send this to EES.  As you will see I 
have a few question noted on the TA.
