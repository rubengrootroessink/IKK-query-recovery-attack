David -

Can you have them forward their network login names (but not their passwords) to me so that I can assign access?  (Or collect them and send them al at once, whichever is more convenient).

Also, are they all supposed to have access to the Gas portfolios?

Please grant access to the rac website to Eric Bass, Tom Martin, Jim Schwieger, Daren Farmer, Joe Parks, Charlie Weldon and Bryan Hull.  They would all like to see their VaR, component VaR, etc.

Thanks.

Dave
