Loftus,

Here's the file.  If you break the date column up into three separate columns 
for month, day, and year then you can use subtotals and/or pivot tables to 
analyze the data a little more quickly and dynamically.  For example, you 
might want to look at the extremes or averages for any particular month or 
year or whatever.  I c an help you do this if you want.    Remember that this 
is a very limited data set statistically speaking, especially considering 
that the last 3 winters were far above normal.  If you want to investigate 
what the possible extreme scenarios are based on past history then I can get 
you the data for many decades further back if wish.  Just let mw know.

Thanks,

Charlie
