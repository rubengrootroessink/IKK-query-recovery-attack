I saw it.   After our conversation, I did add some Citi and Wachovia and have 
since lost but I still think it's a good move.  Hopefully there will not be 
any more financial pre-announcements so the focus will quickly shift towards 
the future lower interest rate environment instead of the mediocre past.

 I am now completely out Intel and did trim some other.  I'm pretty balanced 
now between financials, tech, drugs, energy, and consumer (WMT).

ENE closing at $72+!!!!!
