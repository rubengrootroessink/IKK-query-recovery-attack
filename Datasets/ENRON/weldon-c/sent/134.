> * filament w/Unifi, v)American intermediates, resins and all Asian: still
> * looking and vi)engineered plastics: will keep. 3)NYLON: KEEPER FOR NOW,
> * MOSTLY? i)Getting out of 'heavy denier' nylon industrial via JV with

> DUPONT'S NYLON ACTION TO-DATE HAS BEEN MINISCULE BUT IS A CLUE TO ITS
> THINKING.
>
> - ACTION TO-DATE: partially disposed of half of the $600 mn industrial
> nylon business. But this RECENT NYLON JV (DIVESTITURE) IS TINY. DuPont
has
> consolidated several JVs with Sabanci in a tiny part of nylon: heavy
> denier industrial nylon. This was barely over $300 mn in revenue. The
inclusion
> of Sabanci's assets raises the revenue but net-net this is a tiny
business.
> DuPont is actually divesting part ownership since Sabanci's contribution
> is smaller.
>
> - CLUES A)DuPont is reluctant to part with the bulk of the nylon
business.
> It doesn't seem ready to let this business go . . . yet. It may want to
> unload the carpet spinning or apparel fiber business . . . but not the
> associated intermediates production.
>
> NYLON'S WEAK LINKS ARE INDUSTRIAL (PART) AND APPAREL: THE LATTER HAS NO
> EASY FIX.
>
> 1)IN OUR VIEW, STAYING IN APPAREL nylon will be painful. DD HAS SAID IT
> WILL RELATIVELY DE-EMPHASIZE THE BUSINESS (in the long run such a
strategy
> is tough to implement without impairing the business . . . better to
> exit). Witness what happened to the polyester chain where disposition is
coming a
> decade late in the minds of some . . . at little value. Meanwhile,
> competitive advantage is eroding slowly. i)Maturity allows others to
close
> the gap. ii)Customers have gotten stronger, especially in carpet (45% of
> div revenue). Several years can go buy waiting for recovery. Unfavorable
> volume and raw material costs are hurting near term. Growth slowed down
> some time back. Its unlikely to resume. Industry mix continues to shift
> slowly towards Nylon 6 in which DD is a tiny regional player, vs Nylon
66.
> Further, growth is in Asia, not a DuPont strong hold.
>
> 2)BACKING OUT OF APPAREL (OR CARPET) WILL BE TRICKY. (It's not even clear
> DuPont is serous about this option). In any event, it will be difficult
to
> find buyers for just the fiber SPINNING operation, if they will need to
> buy raw materials from duPont. Further, nylon does provide critical mass
to
> the large apparel effort, picking up cost allocations that otherwise may
need
> to be shouldered by Lycra! Another problem: All nylon producers seem to
> want to exit the fiber spinning step . . . Solutia, Honeywell, DuPont.
> Makes one wonder about the potential disposition value!
>
> 3)SHUTTING DOWN IS NOT AN OPTION: There is incremental profit in the
> intermediate step and that would be lost. A)Apparel is nearly 25% of the
> nylon polymer outlet and without it the scale of operations is hurt.
> B)Apparel nylon is a very large part of duPont's apparel business, which,
> after automotive, is the largest end market.
>
> Likewise, engineered polymers make up a large part of the nylon family
> (though DD books revenue and profit for these under its
coatings/polymers)
> segment. Shrinking 'the rest of nylon' would hurt profitability of the
> engineered plastics area. The rest of nylon picks up overhead!
>
> DuPont seems to be forced to keep a large chunk of nylon because of its
> presence in Engineered plastics and Lycra.
>
> i)Lycra is largely an apparel business. The $1.65 bn Lycra has been a
high
> margin business. It's growth has slowed and competitive position is
> slipping. Yet DD is increasing its commitment to Lycra. The problem is
> that the Lycra franchise encourages a greater commitment to apparel nylon
than
> otherwise. Apparel nylon is 25% of the nylon div revenue.
>
> ii)The $2 bn engineered plastics business has nylon resin as its
flagship.
> This is NOT included in the nylon division. (Likewise, polyester
> engineered plastic is not included in the polyester div). Part of the
competitive
> advantage in the plastic comes from a low cost position in raw materials,
> in turn partly based on scale.
>
> iii)DD seems to like its nylon ingredients business. (In our view it's
ok,
> not a growth vehicle). The combination of the interest in Lycra, nylon
> intermediates and engineered plastics means DD is forced to keep nylon
> carpet (45% of div) and apparel (25%). These end markets don't make as
> much money and are more vulnerable. But they provide over 60% of the
outlet for
> the intermediates and their sheer volume helps provide greater scale and
> lower cost.
>
> SO THE NYLON PROBLEM IS NOT SOLVED.
> 1)ROC has been poor. How will that improve? Asset monetization has been
> small. 2)Growth has been low. How will that change? If anything, US
> consumer spending is slowing. 3)The competitive edge is not increasing .
.
> it could actually be slipping just a bit as a powerful new competitor,
GE,
> takes shape assuming GE's acquisition of Honeywell goes through.
