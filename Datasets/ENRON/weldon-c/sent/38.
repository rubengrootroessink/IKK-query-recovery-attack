I agree.  Even the best of accounting maneuvers will not be able to hide the 
fact that (if) EBS is not fundamentally successful.

 So the question is, is there a way to go long ENE and short EBS?  Probably 
not, but if there were a surrogate for EBS, the trade might work in most 
scenarios.  How about shorting a long-term broadband contract?
