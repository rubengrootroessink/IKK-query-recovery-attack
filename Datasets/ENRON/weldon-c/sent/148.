Here is an excerpt from my write-up on my projects....

3.  Agricultural Modeling

In an effort to help the Financial Trading Group begin effectively trading =
ag=20
commodities, we have attempted to locate a commercially available crop mode=
l=20
to predict macro-crop effects based on real-time weather data and forward=
=20
weather scenarios.  We have purchased a model known as DSSAT, which is high=
ly=20
regarded in the agricultural modeling community.  One of the primary author=
s=20
of this software, Joe Ritchie, has recently retired from Michigan State=20
University and is moving to Texas.  Dr. Ritchie ahs expressed interest in=
=20
providing assistance to us in setting up this software.  His new address is=
=20
217 Camino Principal, Belton, Texas 76513 and telephone is 254-933-7742.
His colleague, Dr. Gerritt Hoogenboom, at the University of Georgia has=20
confirmed that this is the best software for our needs and that Dr. Ritchie=
=20
would be ideal for providing us the help that we need.

A second software product known as =01&Pcyield=018 has been suggested.  Pcy=
ield is=20
based on the DSSAT model but is supposed to be more user friendly.  However=
,=20
Dr. Hoogenboom has suggested that the DSSAT model that we purchased is=20
probably the better fit for our needs.  The salesman for Pcyield is named=
=20
Bill Bodine and he works for a company called Mpower 3.  He has indicated=
=20
that he wants to visit us in Houston on February 2nd.
