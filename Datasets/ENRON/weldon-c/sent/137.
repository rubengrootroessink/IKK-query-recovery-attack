I finally awoke sometime later.  Our trip was pretty good but the game kinda 
sucked.

Hey Dude,

How was the superbowl gathering?  You were cracking me up when I called
the other evening.  Next time, just tell Melissa to let you sleep. :)

This weekend was pretty low key.  I purchased some really good books on
web marketing.  I've been studying them, and in the next couple of
months, I'm going to put together an agressive plan to market the web
site.  I will send you copies of the details for your review.

In the meantime there is some computer coding and other structural stuff
I need to get in place for the web site to be easier to maintain and
update.

Later,

B-
