If we can't get Wilkerson, Hightower (both Top 5 nationally) and a decommit 
or two from Texas or somebody based on this news then our coaches are 
indeed pathetic salesmen. These guys can come in and start as redshirt frosh 
if not play as true freshmen, even though RC likes to redshirt all OL'men.
