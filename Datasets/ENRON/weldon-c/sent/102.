Sorry I did not get to call last night.  I'll try tonight after 8:00.

Can you please call Fidelity at 1-800-544-6666 and update my address?
Your duplicate statements have been going to my old address in Austin.  My 
new address is 13006 Brayton Court, Houstno, TX 77065.

You will also need to sell $2000 of stocks in your Bidwell account and make 
your 2001 IRA  contribution to this IRA account as we have done the last 
several years.  We'll talk about what to sell later.

Love,

Charlie
