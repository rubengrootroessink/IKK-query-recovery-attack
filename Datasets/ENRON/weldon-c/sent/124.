Charlie, I don't know if you'll have any plans for the superbowl but if
you would like to come to Galveston you are more than welcome.  We will
be at Pop's house - Jimmy's brothers will be there - we are going to
plan the menu this evening but last night Mitchell and I decided some
nice heavy h'or'dourves (sp?) might be nice - and anything Mitchell
cooks is really worth the dive.  Anyway let me know.  Love, Margaret
