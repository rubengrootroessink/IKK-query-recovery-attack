WE'll likely move Joe Weber to FB.  He's ~225 lbs and pretty fast for a FB so 
he'll do.  Whitaker will still be TB but we've got a redshirt frosh named 
Keith Joseph who has the dimensions of Eddie George and played really well on 
the scout team.  I'll bet he sees a lot of PT at TB if he's really that 
good.  He was one of the very few guys that RC got over MacIII in the last 
few years of recruiting.
