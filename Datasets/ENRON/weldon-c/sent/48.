Todd,

Thanks for the info.  I may need some help decoding the info so we can get 
exact durations for warnings.  However, I think we should wait until we get a 
genuine expression of interest from a counterparty before we spend any more 
time on this.   It's definitely good that we have this data though should we 
need it.   Pre-1963 is probably not necessary at this time.


Thanks,

Charlie
