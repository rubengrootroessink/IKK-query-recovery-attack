Thanks for the link.  Sounds like they are doing well.  I'm sure that it is 
due to our analysis and advice.

I assume Mary has had her baby?  How is everything?

As for deer hunting,  it's been really exciting as we've been seeing lots of 
young and middle aged bucks and a bumper crop of fawns for the first time in 
my memory of over 15 years of hunting there.  I have not taken anythin but 
our hunters have gotten a 9, 10 and 11 point.  The 10 point grossed 135 B&C 
swhich is not giant but a darn respectable deer anywhere in the US and outr 
third largest ever.  (For calibration, mine grossed 166). I have one good 8 
point that's about 18" wide and 4.5 yeears old but I may let Weldon shoot him 
as he has not gotten a deer there in 6 years of hunting.  I'm still open to 
you going there to take pictures.  It may be hard to schedule but I really 
would not mind if you wanted to go down there and  tkae some pics on your 
own.  I've got one blind at which the feeders are close and the deer move 
nearly all day.  You could drive down for the day and easily snap some good 
photos from sunup to sundown or from noon to sundown, whatever.  Call me at 
281-807-6802 if you are interested and we can work it out.

Melissa and Hunter are doing well.  He's 4 now and will start pre-school next 
year.  We may have another one on the way but we're not sure yet.

Enron is great and everything I hoped for really.  I will be rotating as 
scheduled to a new role in Feb/Mar.  How are things at Dell?


Later,

Charlie
