Thanks for the info.  The $300 is definitely far more than we expected or 
think she deserves so we appreciate it.  No need to send any more, really.  
If you want to give her more, then you can put it toward a Christmas present 
or something.  

Are you going hunting this weekend?  It's going to be cold and probably wet 
so it should be perfect.
