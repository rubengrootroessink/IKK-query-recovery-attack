Bill,

I enjoyed talking with you about our potential software needs.  It sounds 
like you may have something to offer in which we are interested, and we are 
looking forward to a visit from you or one of your representatives in early 
January.   If you want to contact me, I can be reached at 713-345-7229 or by 
reply to this E-mail.


Thank You,

Charlie Weldon
