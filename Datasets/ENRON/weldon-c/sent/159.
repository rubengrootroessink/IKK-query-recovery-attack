I figured you were exhausted so I didn't call - I hope Melissa and Hunter are
better.  I have updated your address and they made me update my pin number - 
it
is 68966896 - they now have to be 6-8 digits.  I got my new subscription today
- it is really neat - thank you.  Also, for tax purposes am I right in 
thinking
that I will only have to claim $2,000 as earned income since that is all we
moved - the year before it was much more and I had to pay taxes.  Let me know.
Love, Margaret
