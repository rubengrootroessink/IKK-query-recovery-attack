Rebecca,

I was looking in EHROnline at my available vacation to verify that it all got 
accounted for correctly in 2000.  It appears that it did except for the fact 
that when I attempted to view my available vacation for 2001, it only 
indicates that I have 120 hours available.  I should have an additional 16 
hours left due to the 10 hours that accrued on 12/31/00 and the 6 I had left 
over.  Can you please let me know how to reconcile this in the system?

Thanks,

Charlie Weldon
