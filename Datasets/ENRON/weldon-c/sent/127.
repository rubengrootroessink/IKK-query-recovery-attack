Charlie 

I wanted to follow up to confirm that we are still planning on a meeting for  
next Thursday, January 1 at your office in Houston. ?At this meeting we can  
discuss mPower's capabilities to model grain yields using localized weather  
information and how this will fit your needs for your trading group. 

I look forward to meeting with you. ?If you have any questions prior to our  
meeting, please let me know. 

Thank you. ?
