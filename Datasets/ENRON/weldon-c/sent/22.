Indeed.  If the weather models that run tonight confirm still are as 
intensely cold as today's and the present hint at another Arctic blast to 
directly at the East Coast next weekend continues then we could approach 
$10.  Pretty risky business here being short or long, eh?

A frozen precip event in the Deep South and Houston is not unlikely next 
week.
