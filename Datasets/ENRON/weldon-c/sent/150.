Andrew,

Note conference room for our meeting today.  I'm also attaching a brief 
writeup of the deal so far from our perspective.  You might want to review 
before our meeting so you will know where our current understanding (or 
misunderstanding :-)   )  of the deal currently is.

Thanks,

Charlie
