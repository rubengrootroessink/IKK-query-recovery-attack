I don't disagree with your view, but I wouldn't count broadband out yet.  It 
may be going slower than we like but it might come around eventually.  If it 
doesn't then there certainly will be hell to pay in the stock rice.

By the way,  I doubled up on JPM today.  It's showed me a profit you 
know.....
