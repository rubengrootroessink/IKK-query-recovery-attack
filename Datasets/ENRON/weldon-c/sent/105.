She hasn't heard it yet as she was feeling so bad yesterday.  I'll take the 
pix tonight and see if I can get a CD done.   I'll get the invitation next 
time I can bare to be around you.

Dude,

When Melissa gets her pictures developed, can you see if they can put
them on a CD?  That's what Kathleen is doing, and it will make things a
lot easier since we can avoid the scanning process.

What did she think of the audio?

Finally, I still have your "invitation" that you bought at the airport.
It was a good thing to buy because the one I received in the mail is
just like it.

Bobby
