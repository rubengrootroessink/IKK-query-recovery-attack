  Worker Dead at Desk For 5 Days

     Bosses of a publishing firm are trying to work out why no one noticed
  that one of their employees had been sitting dead at his desk for FIVE
DAYS before anyone asked if he was feeling okay.

     George Turklebaum, 51, who had been employed as a proof-reader at a New
  York firm for 30 years, had a heart attack in the open-plan office he
  shared with 23 other workers. He quietly passed away on Monday, but nobody
  noticed until Saturday morning when an office cleaner asked why he was
  still working during the weekend.

      His boss Elliot Wachiaski said "George was always the first guy in
each morning and the last to leave at night, so no one found it unusual that
  he was in the same position all that time and didn't say anything. He was
  always absorbed in his work and kept much to himself."

      A post mortem examination revealed that he had been dead for five days
  after suffering a coronary. Ironically, George was proofreading
  manuscripts of medical textbooks when he died.
