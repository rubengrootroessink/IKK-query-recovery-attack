I watched the whole game and was extremely impressed with Benson.   He 
definitely got good blocking but he showed power, speed, balance, vision.  I 
believe only an injury will prevent him from having massive success.  His 
interview after the game showed me that he's pretty mature also.  I'll take 
over 800 yds next year if you take under.
