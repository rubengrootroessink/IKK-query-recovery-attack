A good time, indeed!  Looking forward to another group trip sometime in the 
near future.

I do not have the resources (time or money) to become heavily involved but I 
would be interested in possibly helping out on Congressional elections for 
2002 as well as any other opportunities that may arise in town to "hob-knob" 
or otherwise contribute.

I'll consider what the most efficient way is for you to further your 
knowledge of business, etc.

We should be getting the pictures developed in the next day or two.  I'm 
looking forward to the digital ones you've got so I can forward them around.  
I added my sisters to the GOPUSA distribution list and may add some others 
later tonight.

When is the website going to have our pictures?


Thanks,

Charlie

Hey V,

I had a great time this weekend!  This was a very momentous occassion,
and I'm glad we were able to share it with you and Melissa.

Please let me know what I should read to get more up to speed on the
business side of things.  In return, I'll answer any questions you have
on politics.  I've now been involved with Republican politics for almost
exactly seven years, so I have a little bit of experience with politics
and leadership. :)

When will Melissa have your pictures developed?

Bobby
