Jonathan,

Hope you had a good Thanksgiving weekend.  I'd like to catch up with you 
today if possible regarding recruiting etc.  Can I reach you by phone.  If 
so, where?
You can call me toll free at 1-800-97-ENRON and follow the menu.   My 
extension is X57229 or you can use the voice activated system.


Thanks,

Charlie
