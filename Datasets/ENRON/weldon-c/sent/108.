No problme.  I enjoy helping out.  Just tell them to send you $2000.  You 
should have at least that in cash.  If there is any extra leftover and you 
need the cash, you might as well take it too but that's up to you.  Enron is 
up a bunch again today so you should do well selling today.  Love,  Charlie

Subject: Hi


Charlie, I got your pictures - thank you - they were neat and I am
looking forward to the rest of them.  I am anxious to hear about your
trip but I know that you are probably still trying to recuperate from
your trip so call me when you feel rested.  I have class tonight and
will leave about 3:00 and won't get home until 11:00 so obviously
tonight won't be good.  When I call to sell my Merck and 5 shares of
Enron will they send me a check?  I can't remember how it works.  Once
again I want to thank you for watching out for me and my family with
these investments - I know it is time consuming but very much
appreciated.  God Bless You!  Love, Margaret
