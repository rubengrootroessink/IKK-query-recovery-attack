BLIZZARDS PRODUCE HIGH RATINGS FOR WEATHER CHANNEL, RECORD PAGE VIEWS
More people turned to The Weather Channel instead of their local TV
affiliates to get news about this week's blizzards in Chicago and Detroit,
and nearly 25 million viewers - a record - went to  weather.com to follow
the storms.
           In a survey by Survey USA, 25 percent of TV viewers said they found
out about the blizzard from The Weather Channel, compared with 17 percent
who watched their local NBC affiliate station, and 12 percent who tuned into
a local radio station for news. TWC also was the winner - at 30 percent -
with those who said the weather network did the best job of covering the
storm. Another 16 percent said their NBC affiliate did the best job, and 13
percent said Chicago and Detroit CBS affiliates were tops.
           A record number of pageviews - 24.6 million - were recorded at
weather.com. TWC produced a 6 a.m. to 12 p.m. rating of 0.751 on Monday,
delivering an average of 586,000 households. This performance is well over
twice the average December monthly rating to date.
           Kansas City and St. Louis recorded the highest metered market
ratings during the blizzard, followed by Detroit. The Chicago rating also
was within the top 10.
