Judy,

Thanks for the info.  I hope you had a good holiday season.  I regret to=20
inform you that I will be unable to continue in my participation in JA.  I=
=20
have transitioned to a new role at Enron that will not accomodate the=20
schedule neccesary to effectively serve as a JA volunteer.    I  take my=20
commitments very seriously so my inability to fulfill this obligation is no=
t=20
something I am totally comfortable with.  However, upon reviewing the=20
situation I realize that this decision is necessary.

Thank you for your help and energy and I wish you all the luck with the kid=
s=20
and the program.  What you do is truly making a positive difference in many=
=20
of these kids' futures.


Charlie Weldon

Just wanted to let you know that we will not be having any JA meetings
at Cy-Fair High School until about mid-January.  Paper work will
probably be returned to me hopefully around then and we will probably
start up our meetings again around January 15th or the 22nd.  I will be
sure and send you a meeting before then.

Also, we have been asked to do the Aquatic Gardens centerpieces for the
Texas Society of CPA's gala.  It is being held on January 30th at the
Hyatt Regency Downtown.  They have asked that we have everything set-up
no later than 5:00 p.m. that day.  I am in the process of trying to get
the vases possibly shipped to us direct from the manufacturer.  I have
also contacted a fish store about getting the Bettas than we will be
needing.

Is it possible that you might be able to get us a guest speaker to come
to the school in late January or early February?  In the past, we have
had some one from Human Resources, a marketing person and also an IS
person come out and talk to the students.  Please let me know.

Judy Wirzberg
