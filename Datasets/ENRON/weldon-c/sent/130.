Your welcome and thank you - we were glad you could make it.  After you'll
left Elizabeth said "Mama, I thought you said Melissa had a baby in her
stomach."  She also wanted to know when they were going to cut it out.
Anyway, the Mardi Gras parades I wanted you'll to go to are on February 17th
at noon and at 6:00.  If you go to www.mardigrasgalveston.com you can see all
of the events.  We would really like it if you'll came - the kids always
enjoy jumping for the beads - the adults do too.  Let Stacey and Russell know
that they are welcome too.  Love, Margaret
