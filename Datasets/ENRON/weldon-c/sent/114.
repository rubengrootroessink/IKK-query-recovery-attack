I think I messed up - I only sold 20 shares of Merck not all of them and I
sold 5 shares of Enron.  Merck was down and sold at market for $79 and Enron
was up and sold at 80 and 11/16.  He said this would settle on the 29th.  He
said my cash balance in the account is $2,023.  Let me know if I need to call
them back.  Please reply soon if you get this message for I have to leave for
Clear Lake at 3:00.  Love, Margaret
