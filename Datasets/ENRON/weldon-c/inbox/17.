GOPUSA Latest News

** Special Focus: Enron

In today's issue of the Eagle, we bring you several reports regarding
Enron.

First, GOPUSA has obtained a copy of the "Carville memo" which was first
reported on Fox News last week.  Now available online, GOPUSA analyzes
this memo, and shows how this is simply a desperate attempt by Democrat
operatives to make a scandal where none exists.

Next, GOPUSA gives you information on Enron and the Democrats as
reported by Bob Webster, the editor of OpinioNet.com.  Finally, you'll
get the perspective from one of our most popular GOPUSA columnists,
Carol Devine-Molin.

Bush Update

Weekly Radio Address

THE PRESIDENT: Good morning. In my State of the Union address, I
committed our nation to three great goals: To win the war, to secure our
homeland, and to defeat the recession.

In recent days, we have heard some encouraging reports on our progress
and our work to defeat the recession. But many workers have lost their
jobs and their retirement savings when their companies went bankrupt.
Employees who have worked hard and saved all their lives should not have
to risk losing everything if their company fails. So my administration
is proposing important safeguards to our pension laws to protect the
retirement savings of workers.

Carville's 'Enron' Memo Seeks Scandal, but American People Disagree
By Eric Sloan and Bobby Eberle

On January 28th of this year, one day before President Bush's State of
the Union speech, Democracy Corps, a group led by James Carville, Stan
Greenberg, and Bob Shrum, issued a memorandum to its ''friends'' as a
preemptive strike to thwart Bush's increasing popularity.  Their weapon?
Enron.

The memo, simplistically entitled ''Enron,'' is represented as the
collective analytical work of Carville, Greenberg, and Shrum.  The
memo's goal is clear: ''Enron has the potential to shape the entire
political environment for 2002, impact other issues and reduce
confidence in the Bush Administration and Republicans.''  The survey,
however, tells a much different story than the Democracy Corps analysis
suggests.

Enron Offers Smear Opportunity to Partisan Liberal Democrats
By Bob Webster

The collapse of Enron presents partisan liberal Democrats with a
deliciously tempting opportunity to smear the Bush-Cheney
administration. After all, Bush was governor of Texas, Cheney recently
lived in Texas, both Bush and Cheney have had business ties to the Texas
energy industry, and Enron was a Texas energy company. What better
scenario for casting aspersions in a fishing expedition in search of
official misconduct?

This "too good to be true" scenario was pounced on by David Callaway,
executive editor of CBS.MarketWatch.com in a smarmy little bit of
wishful thinking titled: Enron is not Bush's Whitewater - It will be
worse.

Enron's Corrupt Corporate Culture: A Call For Justice
By Carol Devine-Molin

Amid significant controversy and emerging ire, the bankruptcy of
corporate giant Enron is now resounding throughout this nation.

Enron's top management, in conjunction with their auditing firm Arthur
Anderson, conspired to commit fraudulent activities by systematically
hiding their company's losses and declining profitability. In effect,
Enron's stock prices were bolstered through deceptive machinations, a
notable affront to our free market arena and capitalism. Apparently,
"creative bookkeeping" and byzantine methods were utilized by an
ostensibly reputable auditing firm, Arthur Anderson, on behalf of their
client, Enron.

"We're a great nation. We're a nation of resolve. We're a nation that
can't be cowed by evildoers. I've never had more faith in America than
I have right now."

What a Difference a Year Makes
By Gregg Bish

What a difference a day (or a year) makes.

Just a year ago, during the first days of his administration, the newly
sworn President Bush was being roasted as "illegitimate", "incapable",
"verbally challenged", and a host of other epithets pointedly suggesting
that President Bush lacked the "gravitas" to be a president -- OR a
governor, for that matter.

Patriot Act Another RICO?
By SARTRE

The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act of 1970
and the Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct
Terrorism (PATRIOT) Act of 2001 may go down in the record books as two
of the most notorious laws in U.S. History.  Both were passed by
Congress in order to address the perceived nationwide crises of their
respective times -- the former in an effort to crack down on organized
crime and the latter in an attempt to protect America from the threat of
terrorism.  But are these laws solving our immediate problems or simply
creating new ones?

American Culture: Its Rise and Demise
By Dorothy Anne Seese

The American culture as it was known through the early 1960's was based
on the rule of law, governed by the Constitution, protected by the Bill
of Rights, based on concepts of Judeo-Christian morality and individual
freedom and responsibility. It had defects -- forced segregation based
on race, skin color or national origin was a huge defect. The
desegregation effort was mishandled and its outcome has been
unfortunate, because now we have much reverse segregation and the total
dilution of American culture.

Republicans Should Not Trust Lucy, or the Liberal Press
By Theron Johnson

Remember the old conflict between Lucy and Charlie Brown on the football
field? She would always promise to properly hold the football for
Charlie Brown to kick and then just as he put all he had into a running
kick she would pull the ball away sending poor Charlie Brown flying into
the air and landing embarrassingly on his back.  No matter how many
times Lucy reneged on her promises, Charlie Brown would always believe
her sincerity and take one more run at the ball.

This story clearly illustrates the relationship between the Republican
Party and much of the establishment press here in California.  Allow me
to share my experience this morning as an example.
