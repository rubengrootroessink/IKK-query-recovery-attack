Eric,

We are doing our first preliminary look at a VPP with Abraxas.  Please provide me with very notional gas basis numbers for the below  points.  I will have more to add, but it will be next week.  If I could get bids by year for the first five yrs, then one number for yrs 6 thru 10, that would be great.  I don't know what the vol will be...just assume 5,000 MMBtu/d.

TETCO [S TX]
Transco zn 1 [pooling point]

thanks
