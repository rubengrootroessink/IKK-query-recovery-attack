Per your request, this is the bank info we have in GCP for Barclays Bank, plc out of New York.  I hope I understand you correctly.   If you need to submit a request to include wiring instructions, we normally get them from the CP.  If the CP in this case is an internal entity, the same would apply.  We ask for request for wire set up with written instructions to include the bank info, benf. acct. name and acct. number attached (sent via fax).  What is below will help because in addition to location, it includes the swift address and domestic key.  I hope we're on the same page, if not please let me know.
