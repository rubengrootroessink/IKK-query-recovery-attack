Attached for your review and comment are the various drafts of assignment/amendment documents for the gas, crude and interest rate swaps, together with drafts of terminations on 3% crude and gas NYMEX swaps (gas basis swaps to be transferred at 100% per accounting).  Please note need for schedules and termination payment amounts and parties, as and when.  If you are in need of the underlying swaps, please contact Tricia Spence or myself.  Tricia also has prepared a spread sheet on the commodity swaps which may be helpful.  Upon internal review and receipt of comments the papers will be forwarded to counterparty counsel.  
Nora, please let me know your timeline as to when you want these transmitted to Niebruegge.  Have the original swaps been sent over to Niebruegge or the bank?
Joe and Diane, take note particularly of RMT termination documents which will need to be backed into ENA.
