	Eric,

	We had a meeting with RAC today on KCS. They are interested in finding out any hedges entered into by KCS with us on volumes other than the VPP. I recall that KCS was planning to enter into hedges with us some time back (6-8 weeks may be). I will appreciate if you could get us a printout of all KCS hedges with Enron by date, commodity, type of hedge (swap, collar, floor etc.) duration, fixed price and other relevant information, so that we can forward it to RAC for their analysis.

	Thanks
