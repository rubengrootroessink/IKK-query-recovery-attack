Hi Paul,

I had an hour-long conversation yesterday with a guy from Tyler named
Jorge Uresti.  He proposed a very interesting idea, and I'd love to get
your feedback on it.

Jorge has worked on in media, advertising, etc. for political campaigns
since 1994.  He has experience doing radio spots, tv, print (signs,
billboards) for various levels of campaigns.  I think he sees the vast
marketing potential and national position that GOPUSA has to offer and
he wants to be involved.  He threw out the idea of creating a section of
GOPUSA called GOPUSA MediaWorks.  This division would be under the
GOPUSA umbrella and handle all media operations for conservative
business, candidates, and elected officials.  The scope would be web
design, media, advertising, and on and on.

I'm very excited about this because it taps into the whole top-level
vision I have for the company which is to help get the conservative
message out.  Whether we are doing it ourselves (through our news,
information, and commentary) or providing the tools for others to do it,
we can become THE source for conservative activists to get or deliver
their message.

So, assuming this is a good idea (and if it's totally lame, please tell
me), what would be the best way of structuring it?  Simple
sub-contracting?  Creating a separate division?  My instincts tell me
that subcontracting would be easiest right now.  Plus, if the
relationship turned out to be unworkable, then we simply stop doing
business with them.

How would be go about pricing all of this?  What type of percentage
would be fair?  Obviously, we are talking about work that the current
GOPUSA is unable to perform because I don't have the time (for web
design stuff) or the experience (in the media stuff).  On the flip side,
there is no doubt that we could deliver clients these guys that they
would have never landed on their own.  If some folks in their region
might not know them, but they might be familiar with GOPUSA.

Anyway, I'm just passing along some thoughts.  Perhaps Chris might have
some comments as well.

Take care,

Bobby
