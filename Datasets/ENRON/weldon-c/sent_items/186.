That should work for me.  Sorry for the late response but we had talked about it I guess.

Howdy folks,

I'm looking at having our board of directors meeting on Saturday, Dec.

8.  It will likely be at the same location as last time.

Please let me know your thoughts on this date.

Take care,

Bobby
