Slight problem,  can't get the room in 3 Allen center b/c they turn down the A/C on the weekend and need a cost code to cover any desired cooling.  Hence, we will likely end up in the Enron building in a less nice room but we'll manage.

Dude,

Steve Findley and Richard Powell are good for June 30.

Can you please put together a bio?  I want to have a board of directors
page on the web site, so I'll need a bio.
