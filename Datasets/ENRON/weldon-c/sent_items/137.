Greetings to All,

Here's a quick update on the GOPUSA.com Board Meeting.  As it stands
right now, the board meeting will be held on Saturday, June 30 in
Houston.  The tentative time is from 10am - 3pm.  The meeting will be at
the law offices of Haynes and Boone, LLP (the GOPUSA.com, Inc. corporate
attorneys).  The address is 1000 Louisiana Street, 43rd Floor, Houston,
TX.

I'll plan some activities for us to do following the meeting as well.

Stay tuned for more details,

Bobby
