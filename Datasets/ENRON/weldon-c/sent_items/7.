Sounds like fun.

I got my offer from UBS Friday and turned it in today, signed.  The judge approved the deal Friday also so if nothing gets screwed up in the next few weeks then I should have a new employer (when the deal closes)

Have fun,

Charlie

Subject:	Hi,


Well it is finally decided, we are leaving for Billings, Montana Wednesday  be back Sunday.  Saw 1 by 0 the other day and another spike that needed  killing.  I ask the Game Biologist what procedure to take to get permission  to kill them.  He said to put the cross hairs on them and pull the trigger,  but first call the game warden and find out where he is.  Lot of  help.  Dad
