One G2 was 10.5.  Other was ~9.5.  G3's were 7.5 ish, maybe 8.  I thought it was a pretty good deer.  He would have been really good next year but we've let so many go like that not to ever see them again... , I'm really glad he got this one to break his 7 year drought.  This was his 8th season.

That is not a bad buck at all.  Do you know  what the lenth of the G2's and G3's are???  They look pretty  descent.
