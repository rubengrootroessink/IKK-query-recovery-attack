Charlie:  We made a request to MHI last week and with this memo, I will follow up with Frank Hosak to make sure that it is on the items to be discussed this coming Wednesday.

Frank:  Would you please make sure that we have this item on the Agenda and tell them we are expecting an answer.

thanks, bill fox

Bill,

I understand that you are the contact person for MHI concerning the ash spec for the 501F turbine being used on the Ft. Pierce project.  I have been working with Matt Tezyk to finalize all issues concerning this fuel oil spec. Please let me know as soon as possible what the MHI response is regarding the inability to get 0% ash fuel oil.   We are trying to get closure on this issue so we can order the fuel oil to replace that which we caused FPUA to burn to begin construction on the site.

Thanks!

Charlie Weldon
