Charlie,  thanks for making the market.  Its obvious I've got no business trading right now.  

In my current group I go for days without looking at the market.  Not a good recipe for profits!  I'll bring the P/L tomorrow.

June settled at 3.738.   No pressure to pay but wanted to document.  Later....
