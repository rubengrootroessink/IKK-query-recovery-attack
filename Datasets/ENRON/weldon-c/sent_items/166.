T-Willy,

I met you at A&M during fraternity rush in the late 80's.  I've never forgotten you as you were pretty darn funny as I best recall.  Anyway,  glad to hear you are doing well.  I'm heading to Lubbock and am interested in your tickets if you still have them.  What yard line are they on?

Thanks,

Charlie Weldon
