Subject:	EOL Physical Transaction Capability

Stephanie,

Can you please authorize my EOL account (ADM59501) so that I can transact internally with the following Tennessee Z-0 physical products:

1) Next day gas
2) Next day plus 1
3) Balance of month physical

All transactions should go to my physical book, ENA-IM-Katy.

Please let me know if you have any questions.


Thanks,

Charlie Weldon
