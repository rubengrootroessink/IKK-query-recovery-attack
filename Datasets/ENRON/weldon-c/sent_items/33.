Charlie,

We are waiting on TGP to hear how their discussions with management have played out.  We'll definitely update you when we get more information.

Let me know if you have any questions in the meantime.

Regards,

John

Guys,,

I thought I would just let you know that the latest indicative gas price for the Stagecoach deal is ~$4.62.  That's down ~$0.20 in the last 9 trading days.

How about an update from yall's end on the status of the negotiations, etc?


Thanks,

Charlie
