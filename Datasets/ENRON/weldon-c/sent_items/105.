Matt,

Two quick questions that Doug Leach needs answered ASAP to get the oil ordered:

1)  Name and number of contact person for handling the accounting/paperwork type issues at HD King plant.

2)  Name and number of contact person for logistic/scheduling issues at HD King plant.


Thanks,

Charlie
