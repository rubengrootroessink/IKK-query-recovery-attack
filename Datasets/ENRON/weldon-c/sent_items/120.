Ed,

I'm interested in taking this course as I've heard it was pretty good.  I have applied to take it within the training system and it should be queued up for your approval if you support me taking it.

Thanks,

Charlie

Applied Finance - May 31-June 1, 2001 
in EB552   Cost:  $700.00

The objective of this program is not to teach you how to do a deal, but rather, to give you a better understanding of how basic financial principals contribute to the structure of a deal.    It will also provide you with insight to Enron deals in order that you can make a contribution to the work that goes into putting one together.

When you leave the program, you will have:

R	An understanding of basic financial and accounting issues relevant to Enron's transactions.
R	A basic understanding of how Enron structures deals - the "deal space" and how the financial principals discussed 	relate to 	Enron deals.
R	The ability to take the financial principals and apply them to an Enron deal.
