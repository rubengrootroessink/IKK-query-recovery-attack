Hey Charlie,

I responded to your cweldon@houston.rr.com <mailto:cweldon@houston.rr.com>
address yesterday and it came back undeliverable...not sure what is up but
anyway...

How's everything going with you and the family? How is Melissa feeling? Mom
said they had a great time visiting with everyone over Easter weekend. I am
sorry we could not be there. How was your Easter? We had probably the best
set of Holy Week services we have ever had.

How is work going? Are you still having to put in quite a few more hours
these days?

My job is going well. I am starting to settle a bit into my new position,
but am still working through some transition issues from my old position. I
think that I will like doing this new job quite a bit. I have good people to
work with. Our church band is really starting to come together...I am really
excited. We are hoping to have a concert on May 19th or June 2nd (depending
on a business trip I may or may not need to take). Mom and Dad are coming up
to see the concert. You all had talked about coming up sometime in the
spring...do you have any dates in mind?

Well, I've got to run...I have bonuses to calculate and a meeting to get
ready for. You all take care...give Melissa and Hunter a hug from all of us.

All our love...stayton

P.S. What is your take on TI these days? I am planning on getting some more
Enron stock soon and want to know if you are still high on TI...slpj
