Steve,

As of yesterday's curves, financial mid is 5.169 and physical mid is 5.311.  The physical Index premium is at TranscoZ6 is  ~.035 in summer and ~0.5 in winter.

Let me know if you need anything else.


Charlie

Charlie & Steve,

I work in the power structuring group and need your assistance in pricing a gas swap.  The details are as follows:
	Jan 1, 2002 - Dec 31, 2012
	transco z6
	priced at mid
	
I'm sure I am missing some inputs since I am new to this.  Please tell me what else I need to provide you.  Could you please give me one price with basis included and one without basis.

Thanks,

Steve
