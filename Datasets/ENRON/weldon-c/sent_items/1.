Loftus,

I've been meaning to contact you forever and I just ran across your e-mail address from our incoming Associate class list.  Sorry it took so long.

How the heck are you doing?  I'd like to hear if you have another job yet or what your prospects are.  Please give me a call when you can.  My number is 713-853-3088.

Hope all is well.


Sincerely,

Charlie
