Charles,

Further to our conversation of this morning, I am enclosing my resume. I have spoken to Ed in the past therefore he knows my interest in the structuring group . I would appreciate it very much if you can pass it to the right people so that I can get a interview slot for next week.


Thanks for your help

Regards
Naveed
