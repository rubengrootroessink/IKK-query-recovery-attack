Rain is good.

I think Travis is coming to our house for a few days also.

Enron stock is a long story but we'll just all have to be patient.

I've been swamped.

Call you when I'm on the bus

We had about an inch of rain.  The water was just  beginning to run out at the ranch when I left but I think that it stopped  raining before it really got started.  I was rotorcycling in the front and  was going to keep on until the lighting started hitting all around  me. 
 
Talked to Travis this morning and he will be coming here  around the 18th of June the way it looks now.
 
What is wrong with Enron Stock?  Wish I had some money to  spend on it when it gets to 48.
 
Levis birthday party is today and I'm going to go get him some  boots in a minute.  He really wants to go ride the horse but I don't thing  that we will do that.
 
Thats All.   Dad
