Greetings Editors and Board Members,

Just wanted to pass along a few items and wish you a good weekend.

First, for state editors... remember that you do not need to send me an
e-mail this weekend or any future weekend with you Monday morning
headline.  If I get an e-mail from your updater page on either Saturday
or Sunday, I'll then check your section on Sunday evening and use your
first headline for the State News Briefs section of the Eagle.  If you
want me to use a headline other than the first one, please send me an
e-mail.  Again, I'll include a headline if it is done on Saturday or
(even better) Sunday.  I won't use a Friday headline because I'd like
the news to be fresh.

Board members... please work on bios and pictures.  I'd like two
versions of the bio.  One is a one paragraph version which will be
contained on a web page of all directors, and the second is the full
bio.  I hate to say this, but there is really no rush on this. :)  I'd
just like to get it done.  Immediately following the board meeting at
the end of the month, the Eagle will run a store announcing the board of
directors and corporate officers, so that's the real deadline.

Finally... for all on this e-mail... on Monday, we will begin running
our first ad.  It is for CNSNews.com.  PLEASE CLICK ON IT.  They and
GOPUSA.com will be monitoring click-throughs, and I want to make sure we
deliver good results.  A few clicks per day would be cool.  They will be
running the ad for the entire month of June.

Take care, and please let me know if you have any questions.

Bobby
