Eric,

I am preparing my presentation for Jean and John and I have one quick question.  You indicated the average gas price was $4.94.  Yesterday you also mentioned how that valuation would have changed if it would have been calculated last April.  Do you know what the average price would have been if calculated last April?  I think this would help put things in perspective.

Thanks
Sarah
