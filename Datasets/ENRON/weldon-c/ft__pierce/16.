 SUBJ.: Ash Content in Fuel Oil

Gentlemen, the attached MHI response #2 provides their answer to the Enron question of the maximum allowable ash content in the fuel oil supply.

At this stage we will have to assume that this is definitely their final answer to the ash content issue.

Thanks,
Frank

1. Enron FPRP-EEOS-MHI-0009
   Gas Turbine Process Temp. & Start-up Curves
  (1) Min./Max. temp. of water for NOx control
  (MHI Response)
  As shown in our Utility Consumption List for RioGen project (S4-70027
  R-1),
  Min. is 9 deg.C and Max. is 43.9 deg.C at 5.5 barg.

  (2) Min. temp rotor air cooled to
  (MHI Response)
  We will submit them at the detailed engineering stage.

  (3) Curve for GT exhaust temp. vs. GT start-up
  (MHI Response)
  We will submit it by May 25.

  (4) Curve for Rotor air temp. vs. GT start-up
  (MHI Response)
  We could not submit these data because they are proprietary data.

2. Enron FPRP-EEOS-MHI-0016
   Max. Allowable Limit for Fuel Oil Ash Content
  (MHI Response)
  Max. allowable limit for PM-10 front-half guarantee of 10mg/Nm3 at GT
  100% load on oil firing are as follows:
  Ash content (10% residuum basis)            0.1%
  Ramsbottom Carbon Residue (10% residuum basis)   0.15%

3. Revised performance & emission sheet which will be attached in EXHIBIT
A-2
  (MHI Response)
  Please refer to attached data sheet. (File "M501F Permit data r5.xls")

4. Longer term degradation curve for performance (Enron e-mail of 4/26 )
  (MHI Response)
  Please refer to attached performance deterioration curves from
  initial ignition to 48000EOH, through first major overhaul. (File
  "e00-01172.tif")
