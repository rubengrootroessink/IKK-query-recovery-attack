Subject: Ft. Pierce

I talked to Jared Friday about capacity for the Ft. Pierce plant and Jared 
said that he thought the gas desk and the power desk (Scott Neal, Rogers 
Herndon and himself) should discuss  the gas supply for the Ft. Pierce and 
other Florida projects.  Could you guys set something up?  Please let me 
know.  Thanks.

John
