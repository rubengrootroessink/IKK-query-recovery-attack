Mike, in going over Contract Exhibit A to revise the Ash Content in Section 4, Fuel Oil Specification,  I ran across a note in my work file from an April 18 e-mail response from MHI where they transmitted two comments back to us  on their review of Exhibit A.

The first comment is on the viscosity value that Enron listed in Section 4.  Our value listed is 6.8 Cst (max.).  MHI comment is "Please supply fuel oil with maximum viscosity 5.8 Cst at any temperature".

The second MHI comment just re-emphasizes our listed value for Barium, Manganese and Phosphorus which is shown as 2 ppm (wt) (Max.).  MHI comment is "Please limit Ba, Mg, Phosphorous within max. 2 ppm." 

Please let me know if we can accomodated the MHI comment on the viscosity and revise the value from our original 6.8 Cst down to the 5.8 Cst value that MHI is requesting.  Doug Ottens does not think that using the MHI value will be a problem.

The second MHI comment has no impact on the Exhibit as the 2 ppm (Max.) is what we have listed for the value.

Let me know so that I can revise this Exhibit A and send it on to Mark Thurber for inclusion in the revised MHI P.O. Contract.

Thanks,
Frank

Subject:	RE: Fuel Oil Ash Spec

Charlie,

Based on your response, copied below, on the ash content of the fuel required, and MHI's response, also copied below, identifying the ash limits to meet PM10 specifications, it appears there is not a problem.

Thanks,

Mike Coleman

Ash Content of the Fuel Available:

Mike,

The maximum ash content is 0.01 wt% on the official spec for low-sulfur #2 fuel oil that we would be ordering.  We should plan on receiving fuel oil with up to this amount as you mention.


Thanks,

Charlie




MHI requirements for Ash:

2. Enron FPRP-EEOS-MHI-0016
   Max. Allowable Limit for Fuel Oil Ash Content
  (MHI Response)
  Max. allowable limit for PM-10 front-half guarantee of 10mg/Nm3 at GT
  100% load on oil firing are as follows:
  Ash content (10% residuum basis)            0.1%
  Ramsbottom Carbon Residue (10% residuum basis)   0.15%
