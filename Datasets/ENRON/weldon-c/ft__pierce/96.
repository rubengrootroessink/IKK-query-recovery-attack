A couple of quick questions about the truck deliveries to the H. D. King 
Power plant location:

1) Do the delivering trucks need to have their own pumps?
2) What size lines are the trucks pumping into? 3"?
3) When connecting to our lines do the trucks need anything other than 
standard fittings? 

Outstanding issues:

1) Full spec sheet--especially sodium and potassium guarantees
2) After the initial tank fill delivery availability 24 hours/day and 
weekends?
3) Tank fill and beyond--why not the full 1MM gallons?
4) Dyed/non dyed fuel issue--tax evaluating
5) Identify previous diesel supplier to the plant
6) Design a fuel resupply plan including prepurchase of fuel, call on 
transportation, buy diesel calls for expected outage periods
7) Buyer of record and credit issues with suppliers
8) Tank fill price--fixed or floating? (Platt's, NYMEX, OPIS, rack price)
9) Commercial start date of plan
10) Any other issue to be discussed

Did I leave anything out?
