HHV is not the proper terminology, Gross Heat of Combustion is. The following 
is for Light diesel. First number is min, second is max. Jet fuel should be 
in the same ballpark as Light Diesel. Gross Heat of Combustion is about 6.4% 
higher than Net Heat of Combustion (incorrectly referred to as LHV), so 
divide the Gross numbers by 1.064 to obtain Net numbers. 
Gross Heat of Combustion, Kcal/Kg	D-240 or D-4868	10,820	10,966
Gross Heat of Combustion, BTU/Lbs	D-240 or D-4868	19,520	19,780

Doug,

Thanks for the info.  I have passed it along.

I have one more question regarding heating values.  Do you know what the LHV 
and HHV values are for #2 and jet fuel?  I figure those are parameters that 
are measured and known but they weren't on the spec sheet.  


Thanks,

Charlie
