Charlie,

My original message was:

The new plant max consumption for planning purposes should be set at 2,490 mmBtu/hr HHV.  In addition to this it is estimated that the existing Frame 5 may require 335 mmBtur/hr HHV, or a total of 2,825 mmBtu/hr HHV.

The plant consumption is based on the maximum combustion turbine requirement, plus a 5% margin, plus duct burning requirement.  This should be adequate as a conservative maximum case.

In answer to your follow up question I'll provide the following detail for clarity:

At the max consumption case:

GT Gas consumption is 1825 mmBtu/hr LHV = 2024 mmBtu/hr HHV producing gross gas turbine power of 200 MW, or a gross GT heat rate of 10,120 Btu/kwh HHV

Additional Duct Firing fuel of 353 mmBtu/hr HHV is used to produce steam for exiting steam turbines, including unit 6.  Gross steam turbine output is 105 MW.

Total Gross Generation is 305 MW with total new plant gas consumption of 2377 mmBtu/hr HHV.  

Net power production from new gas turbine and the exiting steam turbines is 305MW less auxiliary load of 24 MW for a net of 281 MW.  At 2377 MMBtu/hr HHV this gives a net heat rate of 8459 Btu/kwh HHV.

The above numbers are new and clean.

A fuel margin of 113 MMBtu/hr has been added to give margined plant consumption of 2490 mmBtu/hr.  This was based on 5% margin on GT fuel, and rounding up somewhat to a comfortable number.

This would make the margined plant heat rate equal to 2490mmBtu/hr/281MW or 8861 Btu/kwh HHV.

In addition to the fuel for the new facilities, it is estimated that the existing Frame 5 may require up to 335 mmBtu/hr.  If this is included, then the total fuel delivered to site would be 2825 mmBtu/hr HHV.

If you have additional questions please let me know.

Thanks!

Mike
