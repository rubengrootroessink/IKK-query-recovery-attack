Subject:	Gas Curve for Austin Energy

Santiago

The curve I need is not one that you had worked on before.  I just had your name from when you gave me a curve for a different project (Omaha).  The curve I need now is for the Sandhill Energy Center in Austin, TX.  The plant already exists -- it was built as a JV with Austin Energy.  COD was yesterday.  The reason we need a curve is that the actual HR acheived by the project is better than the contractual guarantee.  I'm building a mini-model to monetize that improvement in HR to see how much it is worth to the project in $ of gas saved.  To do that, I need the appropriate gas curve from June 13, 2001 through November 3, 2003 (the term of Enron's contract with Austin Energy).  Other information about the plant you may need:

Actual HR:  9,789 Btu/kwh
Actual MW:  184.054 MW
Annual Run Hours:  2,500
Load:  5x16 Peaking Plant
Turbines: 4xLM6000

Enron's contract allows us to call the first 100 MW of capacity to sell into the market.  The rest is Austin Energy's unless they do not dispatch on a particular day.  In that case, Enron call sell the entire capacity.

Let me know if you need any more information to provide me with a curve.  I am looking for monthly curves for this period, but if you don't have them available, I can use annualized curves.

Thanks,
Rebecca
