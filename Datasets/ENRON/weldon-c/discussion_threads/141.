Hey guys,

The meeting today will be at 4:30 in EB751.  EES is fine with accepting the 
gas in storage - with no fallback position.  This is largely due to the fact 
that we are in the middle.  We are accepting the gas in storage, so EES 
really has no choice.  However, they are starting to show some concern for 
swing and true-up volumes.  My thought at this point is that since they are 
receiving the gas in storage, there is no need to worry about swing - it can 
fit in the storage with the rest of the gas.  This may cost something, but it 
should not cost as much as a put.

EES also wants daily as opposed to first of the month delivery.  That's about 
it.  See you at 4:30.

Andrew
