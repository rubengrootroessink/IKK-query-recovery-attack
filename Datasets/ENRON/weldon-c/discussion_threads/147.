This announcement just came out from TCPL:

Planned Expansion of Alberta and B.C. Systems

 On February 21, 2001, TransCanada informed existing customers holding firm 
service transportation
 at the Alberta / B.C. Border Delivery Station and/or the B.C. System that we 
were in the process of
 assessing the feasibility of an expansion of the Nova Gas Transmission Ltd. 
[NGTL] and B.C. systems.
 TransCanada had received inquiries regarding the potential for expansion of 
new firm delivery service 
on the NGTL System at the Alberta / B.C. border [A/BC], and on the B.C. 
System from A/BC to the
 interconnect with PG&E GT NW [GTN], at Kingsgate B.C. / Eastport, Idaho. 
These inquiries had been 
driven primarily, but not exclusively, by the GTN open season for additional 
capacity into the Pacific 
Northwest, and California.

As part of the feasibility assessment, customers with contracted capacity 
expiring beyond November 1, 2002
 who wished to turn back capacity were asked to inform us of their requests. 
This would form part of a capacity
 rationalization process. Customers currently holding one year re-newable 
contracts were asked to inform us
 of their plans to turn back capacity after November 1, 2002.

As well, all existing customers were asked to provide information concerning 
their plans to extend their
 contracts beyond the current expiry date as well as their estimate of any 
additional firm service requirements
 they may have, in excess of their firm contracts, on our west-path systems. 
This solicitation was also
communicated to other parties. This information was to be provided to 
TransCanada by March 12, 2001.

Based on these solicitations, TransCanada has received significant 
incremental queuing requests in both
 the NGTL and B.C. System queue. Upon receiving signed contracts, TransCanada 
plans to seek regulatory
 approval to expand our Alberta System by up to approximately 227mmcf/d of 
incremental capacity and
 expand our B.C. System by up to approximately 216 mmcf/d of incremental 
capacity.

We are currently tendering precedent agreements for ABC Border and B.C. 
system capacity to expansion shippers,
 based on queue priority. These customers will have until April 2, 2001 to 
return these agreements. Once
TransCanada has received these executed agreements, we will proceed with the 
appropriate processes, including
 regulatory approval, to ensure an on stream date of November 1, 2002.

If you have any questions or require additional information, please contact 
Don Bell at [403] 920.5560,
