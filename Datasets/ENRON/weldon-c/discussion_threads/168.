Mark,

Les has worked up some economics on transport regarding Elba.  He would like 
to have some pull down buttons for fuel, zone, gri, etc. to look at different 
netbacks.  He is continuing to revise this but this is the first start.   
Whoever is working on this needs to get an overview from Les and I so they 
understand what we are looking for.

Thanks.

PHIL:

Here is trhe model we discussed.

I am going to add some sheets this A.M., so if Mark is going to get someone 
to work on it, the individual should go thru what I have done, determine what 
improvements can be made, then contact me.  I will send the latest version to 
them, then they will take over full control.

Regards.
Les
