Hello, Charlie

I enjoyed talking with you re. your plans to use the DSSAT models in your
work doing crop forecasting related to commodities trading.  I have copied
in Gordon Tsuji, Univ. of Hawaii, who may also be able to help you by
referring you to people who have done similar activities.  Gordon has been
involved with the IBSNAT/DSSAT/ICASA work for a long time and was part of
the managing entity of the DSSAT project.
