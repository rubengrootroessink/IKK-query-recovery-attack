I just had a request from the City of Pasadena for our offer ( indication 
only) for $10 calls for Socal Border for Q3.  I would say the volume, if it 
matters, would only be about 2,000 MMBtu/day.  At the money looks like about 
$9.70.

Thanks,

Kim

ps I will not talk to this customer again until monday.
