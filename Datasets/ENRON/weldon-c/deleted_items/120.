Charlie,

They basically want to fix the NYMEX and Basis for a potential VPP transaction.

This is pretty straight forward.  Just set up swap model, one for each of the points listed below.  Use the indicated 5,000 mmbtu/d as the volume.  It will be a 10 year deal, with the quotes split out for each of the first 5 years and then one number for the tail.

This would be a good one to talk to Dutch about (individual yearly quotes vs. one swap quote).  We might also want to have the same discussion with the basis traders.

Tenn (S.Brawner)- we need to know which leg (assume for now Zone L-500 leg)
Ship (Eric Bass) - is Houston Ship Channel
TETCO STX (S.Brawner)
Transco Z1 (S.Brawner)

Once you have the model built let me know and this afternoon we can talk to the traders.

Eric

Eric,

We are doing our first preliminary look at a VPP with Abraxas.  Please provide me with very notional gas basis numbers for the below  points.  I will have more to add, but it will be next week.  If I could get bids by year for the first five yrs, then one number for yrs 6 thru 10, that would be great.  I don't know what the vol will be...just assume 5,000 MMBtu/d.

Tenn [TX]
Ship
TETCO [S TX]
Transco zn 1 [pooling point]

thanks
joan
