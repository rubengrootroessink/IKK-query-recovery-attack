Dude,

Did you actually write this?  It sounds way too eloquent for you.

How about if you put your thoughts into a column for the Eagle?

Bobby

>Well, this nightmare known as Enron is almost over for me.  I signed on the dotted line today to become a UBS Warburg employee.  Our trading group was sold in entirety to UBS with Enron only receiving royalty payments if/when we make any money.   I will still be in the same location in Houston (new "Enron" building)  There will be 500 - 600 of us joining the UBS team.
>The deal is supposed to close in the first half of February at which time I will officially no longer be an Enron employee.  Thank God!
>
>I must say this has been and continues to be the most amazing debacle I've ever seen.  From walking into work through a sea of reporters and cameras, to having scores of friends and coworkers disappear overnight without a contact number or E-mail, to seeing thousands of innocent employees lose their life savings; it has truly been an experience of a lifetime, yet not a good one.  As I've said all along, this is going to be an amazing movie someday.

>For what it's worth, working at Enron up until October was a great experience though.  The horrible corporate monster that is now Enron stands in stark contrast to the company I joined a year and a half ago that was made up of thousands of immensely talented, motivated, and genuinely good people.  Among many other lessons, this shows how (in the worst case scenario) a few corrupt people in the wrong places are capable of inflicting unimaginable grief on literally thousands of innocent individuals.  Let's hope it never happens again.  I'd be glad to share my personal experience in more detail to anyone who is interested.
