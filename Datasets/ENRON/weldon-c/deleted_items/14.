Geneva Convention

Much is being made of the "status" of the terrorist prisoners currently
being held in Cuba.  There have been multiple references to the status
of prisoners of war as outlined by the Geneva Convention.

To help folks learn more about these discussions, GOPUSA now has the
Geneva III document available for viewing.  This document pertains
specifically to the treatment of prisoners of war.  We hope you find it
educational.

Be Still, America... I am God

Be Still, America is a collection of poignant, soul-healing stories told
in the aftermath of the horrific events of 9/11/01. Author Amy Bartlett,
who lives and works in New York City, shows how God was present in the
disaster -- even amid the ruin and the rubble.

A Brilliant Performance by a Great Leader
By David Horowitz

President Bush gave two speeches in his State of the Union address last
night, which I had the once in a lifetime privilege of viewing from the
gallery. The first was a war speech, the second a campaign speech. Both
were home runs.

The war speech was designed to firm America's resolve. It began with one
of the most powerful opening lines ever delivered on these occasions:
"As we gather tonight, our Nation is at war, our economy is in
recession, and the civilized world faces unprecedented dangers. Yet the
state of our Union has never been stronger." These were true words, a
tribute to the resilience and character of the American people, which
had been adrift during the last decade of misleadership by Bush's
predecessor.

Should Israel Take the Gloves Off?
By Linda Chavez

Lightning isn't supposed to strike twice in the same place, but tell
that to Mark Sokolow. Mr. Sokolow survived the attack on the World Trade
Center in September, barely escaping from his 38th floor office when the
second plane hit and the building collapsed. Then on Sunday, Sokolow and
his family were shopping in Jerusalem, where they had gone to visit a
daughter studying there, when a suicide bomber, a Palestinian female,
detonated a device that killed her and one other, and injured scores,
including Sokolow, his wife and two remaining daughters.

A Terrorist by Any Other Name
By Frederick Meekins

In response to the September 11th Attack upon America, the U.S.
government has vowed to wipe terrorism from the face of the earth.  To
some officials, this noble struggle might become nothing more than a
word game of shuffled papers and fluctuating definitions.

Wearing the 'Uniform' of War
By Austin Bay

Every Monday night, I put on my uniform and head for reserve drill.
However, it's not the uniform per se that makes me a "part time"
American soldier.

Still, for folks with a knack for the obvious, when essaying the
applicability of Third Geneva Convention standards to a particular
prisoner, a uniform (or lack thereof) is a pretty darn good place to
start.

Hey Media, Leave The Kids Alone
By Mike Bayham

In 1964, Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart was asked to define
obscenity.  Justice Stewart then replied, "I know it when I see it."
 The same broad guidelines are used to determine what is newsworthy.

Many people during the late nineties began to ask the question of the
true newsworthiness of the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal.  Because Bill
Clinton's activities were central to a Federal investigation, the
location of the affair and that both participants were in their
political positions by their own choosing the national media felt
justified in relaying to the public the most precise details of the
affair.

When A Promise Is Not A Promise
By Thomas D. Segel

A promise is not a promise when it is given to members of the United
States Armed Forces by their leadership. A promise is not a promise when
the United States Congress can change its pledges into a different
message having no meaning. A promise is not a promise when less is given
than originally guaranteed.

"We're a great nation. We're a nation of resolve. We're a nation that
can't be cowed by evildoers. I've never had more faith in America than
I have right now."

*** Re: The GOP Abandons Its Pro-Life Platform (Bonnie Chernin Rogoff)

Thank you Bonnie Rogoff for speaking out on truths. We all need to raise
the volume, for we are all that is left to be heard. We must re-take the
principals of the Republican Party, and un-merge the right from the
left. Your article is a beginning step in the 'right' direction.
-- Judith Pratt, OK

I have to say that I agree that abortion is wrong, and anyone who does
so is a murderer. However, I believe that President Bush is doing the
best he can, and his ability is a great one. I think he is just waiting
for the right time to pick up the pro-life issue again. He doesn't want
to endanger re-election, and playing nice to the "moderates" and
liberals will help him get re-elected, and then he can start really
putting the pro-life message out.
-- Tony Lemaster

Hats off to Bonnie for having the courage to say we should cut off "W"
for his shameful pandering to the leftist media by shunning the
Republican pro-life platform. In the time since thousands were killed by
the terrorists on 9/11, how many thousands of unborns have been killed
with the passive blessing of the establishment GOP - with Bush and
Ashcroft not lifting a finger to protect them?
-- Don Zimmerman

It's about time that Abortion is removed from the political process.
While I am not an advocate of abortion, I do not believe that it is a
Political concern. Antiabortionists within the Republican Party do not
represent me - and I AM A REPUBLICAN. I demonstrate that with my time,
my talents, my service and my money.
-- Dorothy Danfelser, Elephant Butte, NM

Thank you for the wonderful article about the GOP abandoning the
Pro-Life Platform. I've been very disappointed in the "straddling the
fence posture" that President George W. Bush has taken. I do not
doubt his beliefs for the unborn and the value of their life... I do
doubt his wisdom in ignoring and brushing aside the pro-life
conservatives who made his election to the Presidency possible.
-- Cheryl Williams, Edmond, OK

If the Republican Party does not recognize that there are thousands of
us, Pro-Choice Republicans, it will risk losing it's ability to win.
There are too many other issues that need Republican principles that
dividing the party is a disservice to the nation.
-- Rep. Harry Tipton, WY

*** Re: Congress Fails Military Retirees... Again (Dorothy Anne Seese)

This was excellent!! Thank you.
-- Kathi Palmer

Praise God!! I thoroughly enjoyed your column with the above title. You
have hit the proverbial nail on the head. Keep up the good work!
-- Michael Thompson, Republican for Congress

Ms. Seese misses the point with her moral fantasies about sex.  It is
suffering, human death, and other war-related activities that are
immoral, particularly when the victims are women and children.  War is
probably a non-natural activity, since primitive hunter-gatherers did
not engage in warfare with organized armies.  Sex and sexual pleasures
and their pursuit are entirely normal.
-- Don Laird, Austin, TX
