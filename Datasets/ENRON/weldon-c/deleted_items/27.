Be Still, America... I am God

Be Still, America is a collection of poignant, soul-healing stories told
in the aftermath of the horrific events of 9/11/01. Author Amy Bartlett,
who lives and works in New York City, shows how God was present in the
disaster -- even amid the ruin and the rubble. Be Still, America,
published by Christian Publications, Inc., is now available at local

Bush Update

Weekly Radio Address

THE PRESIDENT: Good morning. A few days from now I will go before
Congress to report on the state of the union, and lay out my priorities
for the coming year and beyond. These priorities reflect a single,
overarching commitment: To enhance the security of America and its
people.

Legal Kill
By Alan Keyes

For a reason I will mention below, this past week was a most appropriate
time to focus again on the nature of the evil that struck America on
Sept. 11.

The terrorist destruction of that day was evil in many ways, but at the
heart of its evil was the deliberate deadly assault on innocent human
life. The root of the word "innocent" reveals that the notion of
innocence is connected to harmlessness. An innocent person is a person
who does no harm. And we see immediately that there is a special quality
of wickedness in premeditated violence against such people.

Camp X-Ray Allegations Lack Substance
By Carol Devine-Molin

Never mind that initial reports circulating within the UK regarding Camp
X-Ray prison conditions were unverified and patently fallacious. That
did not stop the British tabloids from reveling in a full-fledged media
frenzy in recent days, spewing sensational headlines proclaiming
so-called "torture" and "inhumane" treatment of the 158 Taliban and
al-Qaeda fighters being held at Camp X-Ray, located within the US Navy
Base at Guantanamo Bay, just outside of Cuba. Sadly, European
"America-bashing" has reared its ugly head once again, and is now
accompanied by similar odious sentiments from some quarters in our own
nation.

And now... a word from our sponsor...

"We're a great nation. We're a nation of resolve. We're a nation that
can't be cowed by evildoers. I've never had more faith in America than
I have right now."

The Philosophic Foundation for Politics
By SARTRE

At the risk of disturbing the slumber of the lethargic, the case in
favor of politics needs to be made. With the distraction that passes for
understanding, few have a grasp on the nature of social relations.
Politics is normally defined as the activities or affairs of government.
But it really is the art of human relations, applied to the organization
of society. The basis for government grows out of the perceived need to
establish order. Rules are the results of a desire to construct a road
map for society to function. The confusion that litters the highways,
rests upon a false understanding of how those arteries are constructed
and where they are going. The philosophy of politics can supply the
answer.

Morality has Tanked Around the World
By Dorothy Anne Seese

Let me see if this can be put as bluntly as possible ... tact isn't my
specialty anyway.

When sex and sex activities, straight or perverted, dominate a culture,
that culture is on its way to the sewer, washing all the people involved
with it (and sweeping along those who protested) into the vast
wastewaters of the planet.

Time to Go
By Timothy Rollins

In what can only be described as time to go, former Chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff and Secretary of State Colin Powell has shown that
he is (a), too much a soldier, (b), not enough a diplomat or statesman,
and (c), a liability when it comes to the handling of the 158 detainees
that are currently being held at the United States Naval Base at
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Their current situation as to their being handled
was well described my friend and colleague Robert Yoho in his column
last Friday, which I would recommend highly for your reading.

Airport Security: Top Down? Or Bottom Up?
By Douglas Brown

When I opened the Lincoln Log set with my five-year old daughter, she
immediately grabbed the brightly colored green roof. She demanded that I
start building the log fort as depicted on the container from the top
down. My first attempt to follow her orders brought a puzzled look. My
second attempt brought an angry scowl. My final attempt brought a
giggling reproach for being so silly.

The tendency to want to do things from the top down is not limited to
five-year olds. It is also the preferred method of problem solving in
Washington, D.C.
