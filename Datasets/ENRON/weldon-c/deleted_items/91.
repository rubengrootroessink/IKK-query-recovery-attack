E]WHAT WILL JEFFORDS DO?   As many of you know, Sen. James Jeffords (R-VT) =
is scheduled to hold a press conference today to announce whether he will l=
eave the Republican party.  Current talk is that he will, indeed, leave the=
 Republican party and become an Independent, but for organizational purpose=
s in the Senate, he will be a Democrat.   Now, I, like many of you, cannot =
stand RINOs (Republicans In Name Only).  However, in this case, the name "R=
epublican" carries much more significance.  With a 50-50 Senate, the entire=
 leadership structure hangs in the balance.  Imagine, for a moment... Major=
ity Leader Tom Daschle... The thought is just plain scary.   Please contact=
 Sen. Jeffords' office and let him know what you think.  Perhaps a strong w=
ave of feedback in the eleventh hour can make a difference.  His contact in=
formation is as follows:   Sen. Jeffords' Washington, DC Office -- 202-224-=

  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]REPUBLICAN STUDY COMMITTEE UPDATE   Conservative Activity=
 in the House   The following are just some of the legislative efforts that=
 RSC Members are making in the House:    -- Rep. Peter Hoekstra (R-MI) will=
 be offering an amendment this week during the debate of H.R. 1, the educat=
ion reauthorization bill, to strike the additional annual state assessment =
mandated by H.R. 1 and retain current law regarding testing that was passed=
 in 1994. To read the amendment, click here: http://www.house.gov/burton/RS=
C/word/Hoekstra2.PDF    -- Rep. Jim DeMint (R-SC) will also be offering an =
amendment to H.R. 1 this week to re-insert a "Straight A's" provision to al=
low seven states some flexibility in how they use federal education dollars=
. To read talking points on the amendment, click here: http://www.house.gov=
/burton/RSC/word/DeMint2.doc    -- Rep. Todd Akin (R-MO) will be offering a=
n amendment to H.R. 1 to ensure that state assessments measure "objective" =
knowledge and not subjective feelings and beliefs. To read the "Dear Collea=
gue" letter promoting the amendment, click here: http://www.house.gov/burto=
n/RSC/word/Akin.doc    -- Rep. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Rep. Todd Tiahrt (=
R-KS) will be offering a parental rights amendment to H.R. 1 that requires =
parental consent prior to non-emergency, medical, mental health examination=
, testing, or treatment on students and prior to any student being required=
 to take any survey, analysis, or evaluation that reveals personal informat=
ion or seeks responses on material inappropriate for children (such as sex =
behavior, political affiliation, and religious practices). The amendment al=
so ensures that parents have the right to inspect and review instructional =
materials and surveys. To read the text of the amendment, click here: http:=

ay   Are Californian's Stupid? This Texan's reply is, "Nope, not at all." C=
alifornia is home turf for a high-flying slice of America's most economical=
ly and aesthetically creative people. I dig Hollywood, admire the Skunk Wor=
ks and thoroughly respect Silicon Valley.   But apparently California Gov. =
Gray Davis has a low opinion of his constituents' mental acuity, or at leas=
t their historical memory. He seems to think Golden State residents were ha=
tched yesterday, producing a demographic ripe for a political con job reple=
te with fear-inciting sound bites and calculated flim-flam.   In ecology-co=
nscious California, Davis has hired two acid-spewing generators of politica=
l pollution and cultural degradation, Clinton hit men Chris Lehane and Mark=

do business with the federal government, it's time you took a crash course =
-- in languages, that is. If you don't, you may be in danger of violating f=

 CONSERVATIVE  By Doug Patton   On Tuesday, May 15th, in Omaha, Nebraska, s=
omething remarkable happened. A black man named Franklin Thompson was elect=
ed to an open seat on the Omaha City Council. What makes this victory so si=
gnificant is that an overwhelmingly white constituency chose him over an at=
tractive, wealthy, white business owner who spent four times as much money,=
 only to receive two-thirds as many votes.   How can this be? Those who hav=
e made a career out of what is loosely called "civil rights" tell us consta=
ntly that rampant racism in America would preclude such a thing from happen=
ing. How can a black man be given such a mandate by an almost all-white con=
stituency?   Read the complete article at http://gopusa.com/dougpatton    [=

. Chavez article on John Ashcroft's faith: The article quoted one critic as=
 saying: "He would be charged with upholding and fully enforcing the consti=

rs.  -- Martin Barker, Pensacola, FL   It is about time that someone, like =

 who still rely on God in our daily living have been forced to "accept" hom=
osexuality and every other depraved activity while we are being denied the =

 I and my family are not happy with some of the things he is doing. I know =
now that the  Republican party is so out of touch with the American citizen=
s. Bush said he wanted to set a new tone in Washington and all I have seen =
is more of Clinton's policies being put into place. Bush has done some good=
 on the abortion issues . I am ready to resign as he keeps putting homosexu=
