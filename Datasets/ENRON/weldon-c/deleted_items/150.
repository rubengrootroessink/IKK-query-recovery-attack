AGE]BUSH UPDATE   Weekly Radio Address   THE PRESIDENT: Good morning. Over =
the last few months I have often used this radio time to advocate major tax=
 relief. Today I'm pleased to report success. Soon Congress will send me a =
bill reducing federal income taxes by $1.35 trillion over the next 11 years=
, and I will proudly sign it.    Under the new law, more than 98 million Am=
ericans who pay income taxes will be owed a refund. This year, most single =
taxpayers will receive checks for $300; single-parent taxpayers will receiv=
e up to $500; and married couples will receive a check for up to $600. Over=
 the next 10 years, the per-child tax credit will double, from $500 to $1,0=
00; the marriage penalty will be reduced; and the death tax will be complet=
ely abolished.    Some other provisions of the tax bill haven't received qu=
ite as much attention. But they will make a great difference in the lives o=
f many Americans. For low-income families, the child tax credit will now by=
 partially refundable. Right now, many poor families don't qualify for the =
credit because they don't pay income taxes at all. Soon, they will receive =
a tax credit to help meet the cost of raising their children.   Read and li=

  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]IS "THE CONTENDER" HOW HOLLYWOOD REALLY SEES CONSERVATIVE=
S?  By Doug Patton   I always assume a liberal bias in movies; it's just a =
given. However, political junkie that I am, I defied my better judgment rec=
ently by renting a video entitled "The Contender" and settling in with my p=
opcorn and a guardedly open mind for a Friday evening of Washington intrigu=
e. What I saw can only be described as "The American President" meets "The =
West Wing" on steroids.   Virtually every silly clich? Hollywood could conj=
ure about "The Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy" was thrown into this plot.   Upo=
n the untimely death of the vice president of the United States, the dashin=
g, handsome, liberal Democrat president nominates an equally liberal female=
 U.S. Senator to fill out the term. This is considered a bold move, since t=
he pundits believe that the president's choice will be the moderate governo=
r of Virginia. But the moderate governor of Virginia has recently tried uns=
uccessfully to rescue a drowning woman whose car just happened to crash off=
 a bridge right next to where he (the governor) was fishing. This is though=
t to be too reminiscent of Chappaquidick, and the moderate governor of Virg=
inia is passed over in favor of the liberal female senator.   Read the comp=

 AMERICA, AN IMITATION OF FREEDOM  By Dorothy Anne Seese   The Democrats mu=
st have been smoking parts from the new hemp car if they think America can =
continue to grow without increasing energy resources. "Conservation" sounds=
 nice to the liberal Left, but conservation will only work with static grow=
th. Otherwise, conservation merely goes to the point of deprivation for all=
, and eventually ... at least theoretically ... to none for all.    This is=
 not the America of growth and liberty, it is a liberal counterfeit, a $35 =
bill being cashed by people who don't understand the truth. Perhaps the rea=
son they don't understand it is that there hasn't been enough genuine freed=
om in practice for so long that the true cannot be compared to the counterf=
eit by younger Americans.   Read the complete article at http://gopusa.com/=
dorothyanneseese    [IMAGE]  IN ISRAEL, HAWKS AND DOVES NEST TOGETHER  By B=
onnie Chernin Rogoff  Founder, Jews For Life   When doves cry, war is immin=
ent.   Yasser Arafat probably committed his most egregious political error =
in years.   The latest suicide bombing, killing at least 18 Israeli citizen=
s, most of them teens, was planned with calculated precision to force an ex=
cessive Israeli defensive counterattack. The strategy of the Palestinian au=
thority since the Holy War began has been die, and let die. They know that =
after the bloodshed becomes a memory, any defensive maneuvers by Israelis w=
ill be met with condemnation from the rest of the world.   The terrorists h=
ave accelerated their suicide bombing missions knowing full well that their=
 cowardly and despicable acts will be met with less hostility than will the=
 Israeli governments' retributions. While the Israelis are desperate and kn=
ow they must protect their embattled tiny little country, the PLO knows we =
are in the midst of an energy crisis. In this game of who's got the oil, th=
e Arabs are holding the ball.   Read the complete article at http://gopusa.=
