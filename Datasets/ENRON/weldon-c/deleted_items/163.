REMINDER NOTICE: CHANGES TO YOUR FreeEDGAR SERVICE

Starting in May, both the FreeEDGAR Watchlist and RTF
Downloading services became available only by subscription
on our partner site, EDGAR Online.

This is a reminder that you can reactivate your Watchlist
immediately by upgrading to an EDGAR Online subscription.
Your FreeEDGAR Watchlist is still on file, so you will NOT
have to manually re-input any of your Watchlist data. Plus,
you can download filings into Word, search filings using
multiple criteria, and more. Subscribing to EDGAR Online
starts at just $9.95 a month.

TO SUBSCRIBE now, go to:
