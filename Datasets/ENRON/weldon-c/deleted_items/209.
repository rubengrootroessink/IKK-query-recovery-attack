Greetings to all,

Just wanted to remind you about our upcoming Board of Directors
meeting.  The meeting will be held on Saturday, December 8 in Houston.
Thanks to Paul, we will be meeting at the same location as last time --
the law offices of Haynes & Boone.  Let's plan to start at 10:30am.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Take care,

Bobby
