All,
 
I have at least 2 maybe 3 seats together for the game this weekend that I am trying to unload.  Sec. 132, Row 3, St 1,2, (3).  If anybody is or might be interested get back to me. I'm planning on going in to CS on Saturday morning.  Feel free to pass this on to others I have not included.  (Particularly you, Woloson, to your whole gang.)
 
$37.5 bucks a pop
