	In case you my not know Maria Garza just recently got married, so I have been asked by Mark and Ed McMichael to collect money (what ever you can put in) to get her a present from the Gas Structuring Group. So if you would like to contribute in buying a wedding gift for her you can stop by my desk today or tomorrow with your money.

- By the way she does not know that we are doing this for her.
