Cutting-edge and sometimes controversial (just like we like it at GOPUSA.co=

N ENERGY  By David Horowitz  Sponsored by ARMPAC and GOPToday.com   We are =
losing the war over energy and the environment. Every poll shows it. The Ca=
lifornia public -- where most of the political battle to date has been foug=
ht -- thinks energy companies are responsible for the crisis and favors pri=
ce controls -- the Democrats' socialist solution -- by a whopping 70%. We a=
re losing because the Democrats are attacking us with images ("price gougin=
g energy companies") but we are opposing them with arguments ("it's about s=
upply and demand") that are over many voters' heads. If you don't think so,=
 consider that 57% of California Republicans also support price controls. W=
e are losing because we haven't told the public that the Democrats and envi=
ronmental extremists are waging a war against them -- against their prosper=
ity and freedom.   In politics the weapons of battle are sound-bites and im=
ages. Images are created by a story. The Democrat story is this: Republican=
s are in the pockets of greedy oilmen who are gouging the public; Democrats=
 are the friends of the people. Democrats will use government to save consu=
mers from the clutches of greedy oilmen and their politician cronies. Fear =
is a powerful emotion. If Democrats are allowed to plant these fears in the=
 hearts of the voting public, we will lose the 2002 elections.   Read the c=

IN PEACE, ANTHONY QUINN  By Linda Chavez   Anthony Quinn is dead at 86, the=
 evening news announced on Sunday, and I felt as if I had lost a family mem=
ber. Quinn was much more than an actor to me as I was growing up. The first=
 film I ever remember seeing was Elia Kazan's "Viva Zapata," in which Quinn=
 played the brother of Emiliano Zapata, the peasant leader of the Mexican R=
evolution. Five years old and sitting in the ornate Kimo Theater in Albuque=
rque, N.M., with my parents, I remember crying out loud in the auditorium Q=
uinn's line as he rode across the screen after Zapata was killed: "No, no, =
he's not dead. He's in the mountains with his people." The movie, whose scr=
eenplay was written by John Steinbeck, can be seen on classic movie station=
s on cable sometimes and still brings tears to my eyes.   Mexican and other=
 Latin actors were relatively common in the '40s and early '50s. Gilbert Ro=
land, Cesar Romero, Desi Arnaz, Ricardo Montalban, Carmen Miranda, Dolores =
Del Rio and Linda Darnell were romantic leads in many a Hollywood movie. Bu=
t Quinn stood apart from the others. As he once observed, he rarely got the=
 girl in any of his movies because his looks weren't the classic, fine-feat=
ured variety favored for those parts.   Read the complete article at http:/=

AYS WIN THE WAR  By Austin Bay   No observer describes Macedonia's current =
conflict as high-tech war. The combat pits motley Macedonian government for=
ces -- equipped with mid-20th century military hardware -- against National=
 Liberation Army (NLA) ethnic Albanian guerrillas armed with assault rifles=
 and mortars.   If they're lucky, Macedonian troops and security police rid=
e to the battlefields in trucks. Men move on foot through forests and villa=
ges, trying to avoid ambush. In these circumstances, foot soldiers in the 2=
1st century don't move any faster than soldiers in the 17th century.   At t=
imes, the weapons employed are genuinely 17th century. On June 4, NLA guerr=
illas attacked Macedonian positions with explosives loaded on a horse-drawn=
 cart.   Read the complete article at http://gopusa.com/austinbay    [IMAGE=

House Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-IL)   Tax Relief -- FINALLY   While many in=
 the national media elite are mesmerized by the unfolding events in the U.S=
. Senate and love to speculate about what's to come, we should never lose s=
ight of what's already been accomplished under a Republican Congress and Pr=
esident Bush. For instance, Thursday will be an historic and important day =
for American taxpayers from coast-to-coast. It's a day when the federal gov=
ernment finally will be required to give you some of your money back. -- on=

curial Senator John McCain, promoter of the soft money ban with benefits no=
 one could see or understand, returns to his Senate Body. He claims he is n=
o longer masquerading as a Democrat, but has changed back to his original f=
orm, as a Republican.   Having recently returned from his weekend jaunt wit=

e: Charlotte Thomson Iserbyt's Comments on Education ABSOLUTELY CORRECT. Pr=
es. Bush is being led down the "Primrose path", that road paved with good i=

w Hollywood Really Sees Conservatives? The answer is "No. This is how they =
portray conservatives to the public, for the purpose of undermining belief =

ast propaganda machine" for the political ideology of the left. This is a "=

c to believe. Take your pick of platforms, comedy, satire, drama or action =
/ adventure, offerings over recent years have been little more than outrigh=
t advocacy for world government, leftist ideology, glamorization of the bad=
 behavior of Democratic politicians, and attacks on the constitution and th=
e rights contained therein. If conservatives are going to put this to right=
s, we need to be less naive about the venom housed in the snakepit of Holly=
wood. We also need to fund some movies that portray things more accurately.=
