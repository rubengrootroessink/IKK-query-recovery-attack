Let's shoot for lunch next Tuesday.  Would one of you please contact me that a.m. to see how the day is going.  It's been pretty hectic lately but I think we will be able to do it.

Thanks,

Charlie

Charlie,
	I spoke with Vance Holtzman yesterday about the 3 of us getting together for lunch.  However, Friday does not work because we are meeting up with a large group of interns for lunch on Friday.  Is it possible that we meet for lunch next Tuesday (June 5)?  Please let me know if this fits your schedule...  Thanks,
