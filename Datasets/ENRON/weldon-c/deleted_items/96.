Yes he is.  This is just outrageous.  He gets elected to a brand new,
six-year term, and then jumps ship when its a 50-50 senate.  It's BS.

PS - As per your request... Can you try to reserve a conference room at
Enron.  (or just find out the details)  I'd like to have a board of
directors meeting in June.
