Bush Update

Weekly Radio Address

THE PRESIDENT: Good morning. Thanksgiving this year comes 72 days after
a terrible national shock, an act of evil that caused, and continues to
cause, so much suffering. Yet, the evil the terrorists intended has
resulted in good they never expected.  And this holiday season,
Americans have much to be thankful for.

We're thankful for the character of our fellow citizens who are flying
flags and donating to charity and comforting those who grieve. Americans
have aided the families of victims, and the starving children of
Afghanistan, half a world away. This country has a good and generous
heart.

We're thankful for the decency of the American people who have stood for
the American tradition of tolerance and religious liberty -- a tradition
that has welcomed and protected generations of immigrants from every
faith and background.

We are thankful for new heroes -- police officers and firefighters and
emergency workers, who have renewed our respect for public service and
provided lasting lessons in courage.

O'Reilly versus Limbaugh?
By Carol Devine-Molin

In recent years, Cable's Fox News Channel has catapulted television
journalist Bill O'Reilly to the top of the ratings heap with "The
O'Reilly Factor", his widely lauded current affairs program. O'Reilly
promptly followed that up with a further wave of success as a best
selling author, his latest tome being "The No Spin Zone". Now, just this
past week Internet reporter and gadfly Matt Drudge made the claim that
O'Reilly was throwing down the gauntlet to Rush Limbaugh, determined to
challenge the well- established radio star on his own turf.

According to Drudge, O'Reilly's representatives were "actively pitching
a 2-hour daily radiocast, to air directly opposite RadioKing Rush
Limbaugh", with a network deal "said to be imminent". But, with all on
his career plate, why would O'Reilly seek an incursion into radio now?
That would be a natural query, given the circumstances. Indeed, Drudge
did broach O'Reilly's timing on the matter, noting that "It is not clear
if O'Reilly views the Limbaugh franchise as weakened and vulnerable
since Limbaugh announced earlier this season that he has lost his
hearing, or if the timing of the O'Reilly move is simply a natural
progression of his media success". Clearly, before resorting to this
type of explosive speculation, Drudge should have contacted O'Reilly for
clarification and input. A member of O'Reilly's staff would have surely
returned Matt Drudge's phone call.

Applaud Bush for Limiting The Media's Role in The War on Terrorism
By Rick Erickson

General Tecumseh Sherman executed one of the most triumphant campaigns
in military history by ruthlessly trampling his enemy's symbols and by
methodically devastating their will to fight.  If not for Sherman's
relentless warfare and President Lincoln's trust in General Grant's
choice of tacticians, the Civil War's objective was not achievable
because, prior to Sherman's March to The Sea, anything less than
vindictive war failed to carry the day.

Generals fighting our War on Terrorism have Sherman's tactics in mind.
From day one, a relentless strategy proved effective as Al Qaeda symbols
de-materialized and as the formerly defiant Taliban demonstrated zero
will to fight for Usama bin Laden.  Yet, the media is in a frenzy to be
skeptical of the war's vindication and success.

The Best Defense
By Kerri Houston

As the airport security bill heads up Pennsylvania Avenue for a
presidential signature, it appears Congress may have missed the flight.
The focus of the debate should have been solely about security. And not
just security at the airports - but security on the airliners.
Unfortunately, they strayed.

Airborne safety includes reinforced doors, cabin cameras, air marshals
and armed pilots. Although both the Senate and House had already voted
in favor of arming pilots, several conferees including Arizona Sen. John
McCain tried and failed to strip this already approved language out of
the final bill.

It is important that Congress affirmed the right of pilots to carry
firearms before the FAA could follow through with plans for new
regulations to strip pilots of their ability to defend themselves and
their passengers through the prudent use of firearms.

Dealing with Realities: Economy, War, and the Unknown
By Dorothy Anne Seese

The radio is still a great device even in this age of sci-fi.  Tuning
the dial during the night, the wee hours of the morning, can give a
glimpse of the various levels of reality with which Americans are now
trying to cope.  It isn't all that pretty, but it's better to be aware
than asleep at the switch.  As a nation, we spent too long in our
Emerald Kingdom of dreams and fantasies, false assurances by a negligent
government that handed out money like cotton candy, and a stock
market that seemingly defied gravity.

Taken in relatively small doses, talk radio can be a cross-section of
American public thinking, the Jane and Joe Average concerns.

There is, of course, the reality of a Thanksgiving where not all the
family was home for dinner, because some are in unknown places in or
around Central Asia or the Indian Ocean.  That was layered over the
usual Thanksgiving for the homeless where various religious and
charitable organizations fed those who otherwise might have had to
settle for a can of cold beans or at best a baloney sandwich.  It's good
to give thanks for what we have by sharing our time and
substance with those who do not.  It's also very biblical.

Where are the Clerics?
By SARTRE

For more than thirty years, a consistent slide in religious leadership
has taken over the institutional Churches in America. Once upon a time
their mission was preaching the gospel. Today the assignment is to get
and keep tax-exempt status. The holy grail is an IRS 501 (c) (3)
non-profit tax exempt corporation. Incorporation, of any kind, accepts
the rule of the State, over an organization. Why in the world (certainly
not a requirement of heaven) would an assembly of believers consider
themselves a 'trust' of the government?

The unfortunate answer is an acceptance that avoiding paying taxes is
more important than exhortation of the message. Some will say this kind
of filing is but a minor matter and does not diminish from the tasks of
a ministry. They are just being realistic to the organizational methods
of a modern society. Well, all the rationalization that one can muster,
will not change the reality that a church is NOT a corporation.

In a day when many charities have a suspect record, why are so many
'houses of worship' so eager to join the accounting rush to seek
deductions, exemptions and those blessed privileges of a special status.

Expand RICO, Guilt By Association to Cover Terrorists
By Marc Levin

In Vietnam, most historians agree that America fought with one hand tied
behind its back. In the current war against terrorism, we may be doing
the same, but not because of our lack of political will.  Instead, we
are constrained by our commitment to individual liberty and due process.

One illustration of this is our lax criminal law that prevents us from
convicting terrorists based on guilt by association. The U.S. declined
an offer by Sudan to extradite Osama bin Laden in 1996 because it lacked
sufficient evidence to convict him in a U.S. court. While bin Laden had
not committed most of his terrorist acts at that point, we knew that he
was in the process of organizing a vast terrorist network.
