Dear Intern Buddy - 

Thank you for volunteering to assist the Analyst/Associate Program with candidate cultivation this summer.   Summer internships are very important to the overall success of our program and we need your help to insure that our interns have enjoyable and meaningful experiences this summer. 

We have assigned you to be Michael Finger's summer buddy.   

To kick off the summer, the A/A Program will be hosting a "Meet the Pool" party on Thursday June 7th at the Hyatt Regency from 5:00PM to 9:00 PM.

We would like for you to use this opportunity to meet your summer buddy and to introduce them to others in the pool.  Please make contact with your buddy as soon as possible to make plans to attend the party together. 

In addition to attending this party together, we would like for you to spend a little time each week with your buddy.    We will send out an email next week with some suggested things for you and your buddy to do together.  Whether it is lunch or a simple phone call, your continued interaction with these interns could make a difference in the intern's decision to join Enron fulltime.  Suggestions from you are always welcomed!

As we progress through the summer, please make an attempt to gain insight into your buddy's internship.  Any feedback from them regarding their summer experiences will be welcomed, positive or negative.  

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at x35275.

Thanks again for your help.

Sincerely, 

Ted Bland
