Charlie,

Please find attached two files that contain information for gas swap pricing for the following deals:

1.	NICOR
2.	Anadarko (Carthage)

We have put notes at the bottom of each page to help clarify our request.  A notional price is fine for right now, let me know if you have any questions.  

Thanks for your help,

John
