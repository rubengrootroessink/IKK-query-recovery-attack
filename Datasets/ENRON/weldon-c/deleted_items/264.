The Non-Hollywood Version of Special Operations Forces
By Austin Bay

The inquiring TV talking head wanted me to walk him through a Special
Forces operation. Well, not just any operation. He didn't use the terms
"snatch" or "arrest," but that's the commando action he clearly had in
mind.

As for the target of this Army Green Beret or Navy SEAL bravado? "Bin
Laden. My producer wants to know if Special Forces can get him?"

No, the Hollywood script didn't follow, not immediately.

Resolve
A Poem by Bram Floria

On bedrock of the Eastern Shore
Stood gates of our prosperity
Ambition's arms uplifted - One
Outstretched to catch a rising sun
The Apple of our Eye

A lance of flaming fury thrown
A fit of ancient jealousy
To all the Earth thunder resounds
An Eagle's wings were brought to ground
We watched the silent skies

"We're a great nation. We're a nation of resolve. We're a nation that
can't be cowed by evildoers. I've never had more faith in America than
I have right now."

The TV News Addiction
By Linda Chavez

The fine line between being cautious and becoming totally paranoid has
all but disappeared for many Americans. How can we go about our daily
lives, as the president rightly instructs us, when every hour seems to
bring new stories of yet another possible exposure to anthrax or a
government warning that further attacks on the United States or American
interests abroad may be imminent? Worst of all, with 24-hour cable
television, it is possible to spend virtually all our waking hours being
bombarded with "breaking news," much of which later turns out not to be
true, or at least not quite what it seemed at first.

Is watching this stuff hour after hour any different than watching game
shows or soap operas all day long? Sure, we like to tell ourselves it's
more important, more intellectually stimulating, but that's not why we
watch it. Watching non-stop news becomes a hard-to-break habit, or
worse, a neurotic obsession.

Giving War A Chance
By Mike Bayham

The recent outbreaks of anthrax in Florida and New York has heightened
concerns to a new level about American security since the attacks on
September 11th.  Some people see the anthrax attacks as a sign that we
should be wary in engaging the terrorists and the nations that harbor
them.  Peaceniks who protested America's strikes against Taliban targets
have been preaching that nothing good will come out of bombing
Afghanistan.

The President and other departments of the Federal government have
already warned the nation that new attacks against American interests
overseas are likely and that there is the strong possibility that
American blood could be spilled again at home by those who were
connected to the World Trade Center and Pentagon attack.

A Mission Fraught With Peril
By Scott Gillette

The recent and overwhelming chain of events that have changed the world
forever began in the hearts of terrorists, and then moved to flight
schools and nondescript motels in Florida. They climaxed in the wanton
destruction of a major component of the financial capital of the world.
Now this odyssey with an uncertain ending moves to one of the most
forbidding places on the planet.

The contrast between New York City and Afghanistan could not be starker.
Downtown New York was and still is a brash, cosmopolitan celebration of
humankind's achievements and our ability to be our masters of our own
destiny, an Enlightenment idea if there ever was one. Moreover, the
World Trade Center Towers represented the symbol and substance of
commerce and world markets, and the idea that Joseph Schumpeter's
creative destruction will provide a better life for future generations.

www.idespiseamerica.commie
By Bonnie Chernin Rogoff

A madman who thinks he's God creates a monster out of human body parts.
Isn't that what Frankenstein was all about?

This war on terror is beginning to look like a twisted version of the
gothic novel. The evil Doctor Frankenstein attempted to redefine the
creation of life, as we know it. He was trying to create life from
death; a reverse abortion.

In the aftermath of tragic death and destruction, war creates life too.
War protects freedom and allows life to proceed with advantage, but only
if the strategy is allowed to proceed without too much interference. The
peaceniks are trying to intercept our course of action, and can destroy
the three principles of war necessary to sustain the human right to
life.

Republican Study Committee Update

The following are some of the legislative activities of conservatives in
the House:

--Rep. John Shadegg (R-AZ) introduced legislation aimed at bolstering
the travel and tourism industry. The "Travel America Now" Act (H.R.
3041) would provide a $500 tax credit per person ($1,000 for a couple
filing jointly) for personal travel expenses for travel within the U.S.

--Rep. Walter Jones (R-NC) introduced a resolution calling for school
children to pray in the wake of the terrorist attacks.

Outside View: Responsibility and Power
By Craig Shirley
Special to United Press International

The ancient Greek admonishment goes, "never give a child a sword."
Beyond the obvious, the phrase also meant that one should never grant
power to someone too immature to handle it.

Irresponsible behavior has become the norm rather than the exception in
our culture because it's so easy now to apologize for infractions or
sins or omissions and be forgiven. A quick jet trip to the Betty Ford
Center to be "rehabbed" in 12 easy steps and then celebrated and
applauded for being weak or "just human." That is, until they trip
themselves up again. Then we are forced to witness the whole sorry
spectacle once more.

*** Re: The Sick Mind of Noam Chomsky: Part II Method and Madness (David
Horowitz)

I wish everyone in America would read this article. Afterwards they
would surely condemn MIT for providing a salary to such an obtuse
anti-American as Noam Chomsky.  If the American people are lucky, Noam
Chomsky will go live in one of the Communist countries he so adores,
then we will never hear from him again.
-- Richard Littiken

Bravo Horowitz! Noam Chomsky has been a left wing "know it all" for many
years.  As a young student many years ago, I remember reading his silly
socialist leanings and hearing the professors rave about Chomsky's
analysis.  What is clear is that the world has once again tried to paint
the USA as the evil doers and the international business community as
some kind of demon hell bent on beating up "little people".  Horowitz
nails the issues and brightens the day for reasonable truth about U.S.
foreign policy and, most importantly, the context for the policies
during the last century.  As we all know, context drives foreign policy.
-- M. Gene Aldridge, New Mexico

Good writing by David. As my favorite journalist says of the peaceniks
-- "Get a Life." David may be helping in keeping the them at bay while
our President gets on with the protection of the Freedom of the world
-- John F. Manning


*** Re: Alan Keyes Columns

Mr. Keyes article is to the point and very motivational as always. I
always have the feeling I'm getting ready to go on the field for the
championship game. He is such a patriot. It's too bad President
Bush can't find some place fore him. He would be an asset.
-- Wayne Kellar, Versailles, Kentucky

We need more writers like Alan Keyes. He is truly an American, an
example for all to follow.
-- Paul Emilius
