Bush Update

Weekly Radio Address

THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  I'm pleased to report that our nation
continues to takeimportant steps in the war against terrorism.  Next
week, the House of Representativeswill be voting on an airline security
bill that Congressman Don Young has introduced.

It was modeled after proposals I made last month.  Under the Young bill,
the federalgovernment will assume complete control of airport security
and screening.  It alsogreatly expands the Federal Air Marshal program,
and provides substantial new fundingfor secure cockpits and other
security measures aboard airplanes.

There's a critical difference between the Young bill and the bill the
Senate passed a fewweeks ago.  My approach gives the government the
flexibility it needs to assemble askilled and disciplined screening work
force.

Permanent Principles of Liberty
By Alan Keyes

Our current national travails have provoked much talk of a new spirit of
"trusting government." Certainly, it is important and desirable that the
citizens of a nation at war have confidence and trust in their
government. We should be mindful, however, that this need for trust cuts
both ways.  War tends necessarily to increase the concentration of power
in the federal government, and particularly in the executive branch.

In a free republic, such times as war increase as well the necessity
that citizens trust their own judgment. Even as we willingly accept the
increased energy of the government in those areas where it is truly
necessary, we must increase as well our vigilant insistence that
government power respect the permanent principles of liberty. The
particular danger in times of war or crisis is that the legitimate need
for energetic government action will provide cover for those who, from
vice or ignorance, seek to expand government power at the expense of the
very liberty which it is government's purpose to secure.

Torturing Terrorists For Information?
By Carol Devine-Molin

Recent media reports indicate that the FBI is frustrated, noting
difficulties in extracting information from approximately 150 suspected
terrorists that remain in custody pursuant to the September 11th  "Day
of Infamy". Among the many zipped-mouthed individuals, there is detainee
Zacarias Moussaoui, a Moroccan national with close ties to the 9/11
hijackers and allegedly key in the current investigation. How should the
FBI address this thorny predicament of silent suspects?  Interestingly,
the idea of resorting to "torture" of suspects is being publicly floated
at this juncture, which should give us pause. This is possibly a public
relations "trial balloon" by the government, in order to calibrate
American response to what may become an unsavory reality of war, and to
"psychologically inoculate" Americans before accounts begin to surface.

Empowerment, Not Enfeeblement: The Citizen Response to Terrorism
By Gregg Bish

Our nation is wrapped in a deep, emotionally wrought debate over
controlling terrorism. Nightly talk television programs are filled,
start to finish, over individuals and organizations advocating
everything from outright racial profiling directed at Arab appearing
individuals to hiring thirty thousand federal shock police to stand post
at the luggage check-in and security portals. The Bill of Rights
trembles in its very frame at the stampede of good intentions and short
wit directed its way.

It can be expected that following any trauma, the public will respond
with its emotions showing sharply on its sleeve. Following the events of
September 11, the American public is responding clothed in panic. Such
are these good intentioned and feeble minded suggestions on how our
government ought to deal with terrorism, a tunic of fear.

The 'Loyalist Tale' - American Tories
By SARTRE

"I voluntarily take this OATH to bear Faith and true Allegiance to His
MAJESTY KING George the Third; - and defend to the utmost of my Power,
His sacred Person, Crown and Government, against all Persons
whatsoever."

Words like these may seem strange to inhabitants of the twenty first
century, but to citizenry of the revolutionary period, this was the
making of serious discourse. Just hollow rhetoric, or was this sentiment
of the day, a fair reflection by a significant portion of the
population?

The UN Speaks
By Dorothy Anne Seese

The United Nations wants the US to cease hostilities in Afghanistan
until it can get water, food and supplies to the people, particularly
the children.  Oh my here we go.  I don't recall the UN issuing any
mandates to the terrorists, whoever they are, or their supporting
nations, to halt terrorist attacks on the US, including bioterrorism,
until they could make sure no American children would be harmed.

Who Are the Heroes?
By Star Parker

During these difficult times, it is beautiful and energizing for me to
watch my fellow Americans refocus on the powerful principles that
makeour country so great. I know, as I see the flags flying and the red,
white, and blue lapel pins now widely sported, that we are indeed a
nation under God, exalting and realizing the will of the Creator as each
of us fulfill our unique destinies as free men and women.

Yet, in the midst of this, I am also saddened and dismayed by things I
am hearing from some of my fellow citizens and from some of our allies'
abroad. What type of thinking could conclude that the horrendous,
murderous act that occurred on September 11th can be justified in any
way and that somehow, this grotesque behavior is our fault? What type
ofthinking could possibly conclude that a cowardly act, resulting in the
murder of innocent men, women, and children, is religious or heroic?
