FOR SLAVERY ARE NOT THE ANSWER  By Linda Chavez   If it were possible to wi=
pe out the legacy of slavery by writing a big, fat check, I'd be all for it=
. Who wouldn't be in favor of a simple solution to the problems that plague=
 much of the African American community in America today -- especially sinc=
e all of us are affected, not just blacks? Imagine, a one-time payment that=
 would solve family breakdown, poverty and homicide among young, black male=
s. But there are no easy solutions, and the payment of reparations to the d=
escendants of slaves certainly isn't the answer. It's just more of the same=
 liberal cure-all: Let government redistribute money from one group to try =
to solve the problems of another.   The reparations movement got a big boos=
t this week when one of America's most distinguished newspapers, the Philad=
elphia Inquirer, endorsed the concept in an editorial. But the real impetus=
 behind the reparations campaign is the grievance industry -- that group of=
 professional guilt-mongers who hope to enrich themselves by claiming to re=
present the downtrodden.   Read the complete article at http://gopusa.com/l=

Bay   I plead guilty to harboring hope.   I hope Secretary of State Colin P=
owell's recent trip to sub-Saharan Africa marks the end of Washington's era=
 of "symbolic politics" in the troubled region.   I hope for a new era of "=
African realpolitik" that directs aid to developing the human resources, po=

economic growth and social stability.   But awareness of sub-Saharan Africa=

y (as I am) knew could happen. It is my personnel belief that Jeffords had =
to jump ship because we revealed the true intent of the current administrat=
ion to further the gay agenda here in Vermont. Mr. Jeffords had no other op=
tion but to move to the side of the isle that has supported his office for =
so long. I now know that here in Vermont we will be able to protect our chi=
ldren from the perversion of the homosexual movement. We have started to pi=
cket the presence of Out Right Vermont (which is a radical homosexual organ=
ization) at youth rallies. We use their own documents to inform community m=
embers (both parents and law enforcement) about their objectives and the re=
sults have been glorious and to God Be The Glory. Thank you for all you do =
in facilitating this occurrence.  -- David Ayer   When they write a book ab=
out Republican statesmen, leave Jeffords out! That said, Pres. Bush and the=
 VP blew it by not inviting Jeffords to the Teacher of the Year ceremony. T=
hey can say all they want to about how many members of congress they would =
have had to invite, since all states  had a teach, at the ceremony, but the=
 state congressional delegation from the state the Teach or the Year came f=

per Trail, I would like to have input into your discussions on education. I=
 think it is important for Americans to support constitutional principles r=

t President Bush's education agenda.  The U.S. Department of Education is a=
