Okay Mr. Weldon,

I searched all my data and could not find where you might have given me monthly PG&E city gate prices.  At your convenience could you send these along to me along with monthly Nymex going back a couple of years.  I looked at what you had sent Kim and it looks like a PG&E WACOG calculation.

Thanks.

Phil
