Bush Update

Weekly Radio Address

THE PRESIDENT: Good morning. On Monday, communities across America will
celebrate the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Laura will
visit Atlanta to commemorate the day in Dr. King's home town. I will
welcome Dr. King's family to the White House. This year's observance is
an opportunity to celebrate the contributions of Dr. King, and honor the
principles for which he lived and died.

Americans can proudly say that we have overcome the institutionalized
bigotry that Dr. King fought. Now our challenge is to make sure that
every child has a fair chance to succeed in life. That is why education
is the great civil rights issue of our time.

Liberty's Silver Lining
By Alan Keyes

Friends of liberty began this new year in sorrow over the sudden death
of Tom Silver, president and cofounder of the Claremont Institute and
champion of the principles and practice of liberty.  He died suddenly of
an aggressive brain tumor that was only discovered days earlier, but
what we will remember is a life devoted to the service of God, liberty,
country, family and friends.  Men like Tom Silver make liberty possible,
and the privilege of having them as fellow citizens is a great part of
what makes liberty so sweet.

Beyond News Media Bias
By Carol Devine-Molin

"When it comes to arrogance, power, and lack of accountability,
journalists are probably the only people on the planet who make lawyers
look good." Steven Brill - editor of the now defunct media watchdog
publication "Brill's Content".

This aforesaid quote is the opening salvo launched by journalist Bernard
Goldberg in his recently published book, "Bias", a provocative tome that
is garnering an array of responses, both in and out of the field of
 journalism. The veteran newsman, and consummate insider, produced a
notable expose that examines entrenched liberal bias in the newsroom,
and the accompanying distortions in the news. What motivated Goldberg to
write a book that was sure to cause much angst in the news business?
 Actually, he has been on this trajectory for several years, sounding
the alarm on numerous occasions, both privately and in the press,
regarding the scourge of the left-leaning news media.

And now... a word from our sponsor...

"We're a great nation. We're a nation of resolve. We're a nation that
can't be cowed by evildoers. I've never had more faith in America than
I have right now."
-- George W. Bush September 16, 2001

Statue Squabble Embodies Lies of Racial Preferences
By Marc Levin

After captivating America and the world with its courage and heroism in
putting out the monstrous fire of September 11, the New York City Fire
Department was recently forced to extinguish the flames of a public
relations disaster. Developer Bruce Ratner commissioned a statue for the
FDNY headquarters based on the inspirational photo of firemen Billy
Eisengrein, George Johnson and Dan McWilliams hoisting the American flag
at Ground Zero the afternoon of September 11.

However, there was one modification to Hackensack Record photographer
Thomas E. Franklin's image: the three white firemen morphed into one
white, one black and one Hispanic. Thus, the two white firefighters were
replaced by fictitious firemen of color who did not actually rise from
the rubble and unfurl Old Glory.

Dear Mr. President, There are Still Right-Wing Republicans Out Here
By Dorothy Anne Seese

Perhaps somehow, somewhere, someone in your administration may read
this, President Bush, and let you know that all the conservatives
haven't come to terms with either the globalist agenda or the centrist
policies in this nation.

There are many of us out here in the land of cyberspace who communicate
with each other about the America we feel we are losing.  We are still
Republicans, but we feel our party is leaving us without a voice, other
than that of Ron Paul, in Congress.  Maybe it's time to just organize
our complaints one by one.

Capitalist Owners of the Corporate Economy
By SARTRE

As any school student knows, Capitalism is supposed to be based upon
ownership of a business venture. Whether private or corporate, this
proprietary claim is founded on the principle of property.  To deny the
legitimacy of this right, is to forego the sovereignty of the
individual. For People to be Free, they must retain the right of
ownership, especially as applied to a business. But owning a company
does not guarantee that its control is under your command.
