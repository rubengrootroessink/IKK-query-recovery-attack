AMERICA STRIKES BACK
A platoon of crack Special Forces soldiers have taken the first steps of
reprisal after the September 11 incidents in America.
The heroic force, composed of Texas A&M corps graduates, have broken into
the dog kennel area of the A&M Veterinary Science Building and captured all
the Afghans.
They reported light casualties.
