I'm confused, but you sound fired up, so I'm fired up (by the transitive property of being fired up).

I have an "interview" this pm with the 2 Texas Desk VP's.  IT's supposed to be informal.  If I go there I will not be on the "trading track" but will be a trader.  Sounds like a good deal to me.  We'll see what they say.

I'm in the program but not sure yet if I will have to rotate or can go straight to the texas desk.  Lavorato and the Texas desk head are discussing it.  At least they know who I am.
