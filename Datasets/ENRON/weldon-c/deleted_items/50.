Well it is finally decided, we are leaving for Billings, Montana Wednesday  be back Sunday.  Saw 1 by 0 the other day and another spike that needed  killing.  I ask the Game Biologist what procedure to take to get permission  to kill them.  He said to put the cross hairs on them and pull the trigger,  but first call the game warden and find out where he is.  Lot of  help.  Dad
