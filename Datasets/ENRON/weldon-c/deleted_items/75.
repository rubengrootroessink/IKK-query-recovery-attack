"We're a great nation. We're a nation of resolve. We're a nation that
can't be cowed by evildoers. I've never had more faith in America than
I have right now."

Bush Update

Weekly Radio Address

THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  The events of September the 11th left
America sadder and stronger, and they clarified some important goals for
our country.  We have a war to wage and a recession to fight.  Defending
our country and strengthening our economy are great priorities for 2002.
 We must be determined and we must keep our focus.

This Saturday, I'm traveling in Oregon and California, talking with
people who have been hit hard by the economic downturn.  When I return
to Washington on Monday, I will be meeting with my economic advisors and
other officials to discuss the latest economic data and work for a quick
recovery for our economy.

Choosing the Path Home
By Alan Keyes

The afterglow of the Christmas season is a good occasion to recall that
the American family, like the Holy Family leaving Bethlehem, has a long
journey ahead of it.  And there are other reminders for us in the
Christmas story -- some cheerful, and others less so.  Among these are
the families that remained in Bethlehem, grieving over the sacrifice of
innocent children, killed at Herod's command.

This Christmas has been indelibly marked by the events of Sept. 11, and
the ongoing struggle against terrorism.  Yet it is not these evils which
the slaughter of innocents at the first Christmas should most bring to
mind.  A greater grief than international terror afflicts us, because
our children, who are the future of America, remain under savage assault
both within the womb and during their most vulnerable early years.

The Rumsfeld Mystique: Understanding His Popularity
By Carol Devine-Molin

I noticed that the ground was beginning to shift last summer with the
re-emergence of  machismo males, or truly masculine men if you will,
embracing their testosterone-driven  behaviors, and coming back into
style. In a scene reminiscent of the movie "Jaws", eight- year old
Jessie Arbogast lost his arm stemming from an attack by a 7-foot bull
shark on  July 6th of last year in Florida. The young victim's uncle,
Vance Flosenzier, was there to  intervene in a spectacular manner at the
onset. In an amazing accomplishment, Flosenzier  proceeded to drag that
dastardly shark, that carnivorous sea beast, to the shore with only  his
bare hands and brute force, for the purpose of extracting the boy's arm
from the  shark's gut. In our collective memory, none of us had ever
heard of such a thing being  done before. And everyone loved it!

And the "Day of Infamy" only generated more respect for the intrepid
"manly men" of  the working class, the firefighters, policemen and
emergency workers who braved life  and limb to rescue those at the World
Trade Center. As President Bush has indicated, the  tragic circumstances
of 9/11 have caused us to re-evaluate our priorities, and to sort out
that which is truly important in life. And, clearly, a dauntless spirit
and selflessness are  not only salient human attributes, but deeply
attractive ones as well.

The Euro Makes All Things Possible
By SARTRE

Euro, Euro, Euro all around, but not a pence of 'real money', to spend.
With these euro notes of this common currency, the wire services heap
praise on its successful launch. The wheels of business and the
mechanism of finance are all in gear to usher in this brave new world of
commerce. For years we have heard the benefits of the first united
coinage since the Roman Empire and the elimination of the chaos of
individual currencies. So what will this conversion mean for Europe and
the rest of the world?

The conclusion largely depends on what you consume from the political
plate and whether you wish to place your thumb on the scale that weighs
the beef. The traditions of Europe are quite different from those of the
original colonies when it comes to a monetary perspective. With the
founding of our Nation, constitutional powers were enumerated regarding
the nature and coinage of money. Individual States were restricted from
their own coinage, while punishment for counterfeiting was established.
Standard weights and measures of gold and silver were defined as legal
tender. So what does this have to do with the modern world and the
financial developments on the continent?

A Good Villain is Hard to Find
By Dorothy Anne Seese

It's just not easy to find a good sustainable villain in our modern
times.

Hitler and Stalin enjoyed a fairly long run on the world's Bijou stage,
but after their days came to an end, Hitler in 1945 and Stalin in 1953,
we really haven't had anyone of their evil ilk in the real world.  To be
sure, Mao Tse Tung got his share of publicity and may have done in more
folks than either Hitler or Stalin, but he had no real persona in the
west.  Fidel Castro has been little more than a familiar name for a
perpetual nuisance who always looks like he needs a bath, de-lousing and
some deodorant.
