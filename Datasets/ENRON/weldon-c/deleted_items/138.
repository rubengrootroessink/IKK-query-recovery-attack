Charlie--Would it be possible to reschedule our lunch for sometime next week, say Tuesday?  I guess the rest of the guys had planned a lunch on Friday with additional UT alumni/Enron employees.  You are welcome to join us; however, I know you said you would prefer a smaller group.  I definitely want to visit with you about your experiences here at Enron.  Just let me know what works.

Thanks--Vance
