"We're a great nation. We're a nation of resolve. We're a nation that
can't be cowed by evildoers. I've never had more faith in America than
I have right now."

Bush Update

Weekly Radio Address

THE PRESIDENT: Good morning. We have entered a busy season here in
Washington. Soon, Congress will be back in session. I will go to the
Capitol to report on the state of our union and I will present a budget
that sets the priorities of our government for fiscal year 2003.

Our highest priorities are clear to all. We must give our military every
tool and weapon it needs to prevail in the war against terror. We must
strengthen our country's defenses against further attack, with a
comprehensive program of homeland security. And we must get our
country's economy growing and creating jobs once again.

Preserving Freedom, Beating Terror
By Alan Keyes

As we settle in for the long haul in the war against terrorism, we are
establishing the patterns that will determine whether that war secures
or loses our liberty.  Much depends on the kind of contribution average
American citizens make to this effort.  How can we help protect American
liberty, and strengthen it in the process?  Some history will help
answer this question.

After the Second World War, the governing concept of American military
policy shifted from mobilization to readiness, on the assumption that we
had to be ready for conflict, on a relatively large scale, at all times.
 The shift was reasonable, made necessary by the persistent military
challenge from the Soviet Union and the need to protect friends and
interests around the globe.

Lurking Threat Of National ID Card: Can Big Brother Be Stopped?
By Carol Devine-Molin

Unfortunately, it appears that we are inexorably moving toward a
National Identification Card system, an Orwellian nightmare that would
permit easy tracking and surveillance of individuals on a level once
considered unimaginable. It's not happening in a blatant power grab by
government, but in small, incremental steps that nonetheless will have
the same deleterious outcome. Our society is "slipping and sliding"
toward "Big Brother" snoopery with plans for embedding crucial
identification data into microchips on our drivers' licenses. And,
clearly, widespread encroachment upon our privacy is being significantly
abetted by advancing technologies. Understandably, civil libertarians
are sounding the clarion call to alert the general public to the
inherent dangers of a centralized identification system.

Have Gun, Will Travel
By SARTRE

Few topics cause more confusion and emotionalism than the subject of
guns. But before you speculate that this pacifist author is against the
second amendment, consider the nature of the real issue. Guns are simply
an instrument of function. The principle that is part of our heritage,
is the inalienable ability for self defense. This natural right, does
not exist because government has passed a law or grants some privilege.
Protecting your own life and safety is intrinsic to your very existence.
So why do so many people confuse gun ownership with self protection,
when the former is only a means, while the later is an immutable right?

Final Attack on America: The Assault on Her Christian Heritage and
Values
By Dorothy Anne Seese

My greatest fear for the beloved America in which I was born is not from
Islamic terrorists, as brutal as they are in their fierce hatred. (The
media's labeling of them as "fundamentalists" is quite ironic, because
fundamentalism is adhering to the core of one's belief system, which
would be an indictment of the Islam of the Qur'an as advocating
terrorism.)

America will never be destroyed from without, whether a few planes are
taken down or not. The recent airport fiascos are a testimony to our
hysteria rather than to the common sense alternative of arming the pilot
and first officer with guns, and the flight attendants with stun guns.
While all the airport boondoggles are wasting time and enormous amounts
of money, the Islamic radicals could be out purchasing surface-to-air
missiles to bring down any flight they wish to target, as some believe
TWA Flight 800 was brought down.
