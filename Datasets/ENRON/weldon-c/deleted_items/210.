Lone Star Shoot out; High Noon in Houston
By Jack Rains
Former Texas Secretary of State
Campaign Chairman, Orlando Sanchez for Mayor

On December 1, history will be made in Houston. A hotly contested run
off in Houston's Mayoral election pits a fiscal conservative Republican
Orlando Sanchez against a two-term incumbent, liberal Democrat, Lee
Brown, former Drug Czar to President Bill Clinton. The challenger,
Sanchez, has a slight lead in the race, and Democrats all over the
country are rallying to try and save Brown.

Houston, America's fourth largest city, and the southeast Texas region
it dominates, accounts for roughly one third of the Texas vote total and
is a rich area for political contributions. Houston accounts for over a
third of all the political money raised in Texas in both parties. In a
strong Mayor form of government, such as Houston has, the mayor with a
$1.5 Billon annual budget, and controlling half as much again through
appointments to Boards and Commissions, exercises great influence over
the business community, and their political activity.

Editor's Note: Please do whatever you can to help Orlando Sanchez in
this race.  I have known Orlando for over six years and worked on his
first city council race.  He is a solid conservative and someone who
will represent Houston with honor.  We need to get rid of Lee Brown now!
You saw what he did as drug czar under Bill Clinton (absolutely
nothing), and that's exactly what he's done for Houston.  Please
contribute what you can to help elect a conservative as the next Mayor
of Houston.

========================================================================
And now... a word from our sponsor...

ORLANDO SANCHEZ FOR MAYOR

A Houstonian since 1962, Houston City Council Member Orlando Sanchez has

Bush Update

Weekly Radio Address
Delivered by First Lady Laura Bush

Laura Bush: Good morning. I'm Laura Bush, and I'm delivering this week's
radio address to kick off a world-wide effort to focus on the brutality
against women and children by the al-Qaida terrorist network and the
regime it supports in Afghanistan, the Tablian. That regime is now in
retreat across much of the country, and the people of Afghanistan -
especially women - are rejoicing. Afghan women know, through hard
experience, what the rest of the world is discovering: The brutal
oppression of women is a central goal of the terrorists. Long before the
current war began, the Taliban and its terrorist allies were making the
lives of children and women in Afghanistan miserable. Seventy percent of
the Afghan people are malnourished. One in every four children won't
live past the age of five because health care is not available. Women
have been denied access to doctors when they're sick. Life under the
Taliban is so hard and repressive, even small displays of joy are
outlawed - children aren't allowed to fly kites; their mothers face
beatings for laughing out loud. Women cannot work outside the home, or
even leave their homes by themselves.

Wheaton group says AT&T Broadband Ignoring Demand for Fox News Channel
By Dan Zanoza, GOPUSA News Contributor

Chicago, IL (GOPUSA) -- Since the Fox News Channel (FNC) went on the air
in 1996, viewer demand for the cable news service, with popular hosts
like Bill O'Reilly, has increased dramatically. The latest ratings show
O'Reilly defeating the Cable News Network's (CNN) popular television
host Larry King. O'Reilly's success in the ratings is especially
significant because FNC is available in far fewer households than CNN.
For example, AT&T Broadband, the nation's largest cable company, with
nearly 14.4 million subscribers and 94 percent of the Chicagoland
market, does not carry FNC for about 50 percent of the Chicagoland
households the company serves, including those in Wood Dale, Palos Park
and Wheaton.

Dave Diersen, spokesman for a group called "Wheaton for FNC" told GOPUSA
thousands of AT&T Broadband's current and former subscribers, in
municipalities where the company does not carry FNC, have asked for the
channel, but the company continues to ignore their requests. It has been
reported a number of elected officials, including Illinois Senate
President Pate Philip, Wood Dale; state Senator and gubernatorial
candidate Patrick O'Malley, Palos Park; Senator Peter Roskam and
Representative Randall Hultgren, Wheaton, have joined the call for AT&T
Broadband to include FNC to its cable lineup in the aforementioned
areas. The company recently replaced its Chairman & CEO and announced
that it would increase its cable prices by 5.5 percent on January 1,
2002. Its parent, AT&T, is attempting to sell the company.

Teaching the Truth
By Alan Keyes

The burgeoning movement to restore to our school children an
understanding of America's historic heritage, our founding documents and
the principles that underlie our way of life, has come just in time.
Nothing is more important than restoring clarity in the minds of our
young people about the crucial role that each and every citizen plays in
the life of this Republic.

Throughout human history, self-government by the people has been almost
non-existent.  Ours is the first great nation to sustain an experiment
in this kind of self-government over the course of centuries.  Our
founders understood that the effort to establish a government based on
the consent of the governed was exceptional and difficult.

Because of the success of the experiment, we have had a tendency to take
it for granted.  But to live under a regime that respects the rights and
dignity of all, where we each have some share of participation in the
decisions that shape the destiny of our community and our future, is a
blessing ? an extraordinary blessing.  It will be a fatal mistake if we
continue to take it for granted.

Bush Superbly Cleans Up Clinton's Mess
By Carol Devine-Molin

As of this writing, the Taliban forces are in full retreat, as critical
cities, Mazar-e-Sharif, and the capital Kabul, are now firmly under the
control of the American-backed insurgents from the Northern Alliance.
The cities of Kandahar and Jalalabad are about to topple, with the
Taliban fleeing to the mountains in an attempt to re-group and launch
guerrilla style attacks upon their enemies.

Contemporaneously, US Special Operations troops are in keen pursuit and
zeroing in on Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda terrorist network. And the
worst fears of the civilized world were confirmed upon the discovery of
a nuclear device blueprint found at a bombed-out al Qaeda safe house in
Kabul. This blueprint, and other documents unearthed at that site,
represent a US intelligence bonanza, verifying that bin Laden's
organization indeed has access to fissile materials for the construction
of nuclear and radiological weaponry. Moreover, in anticipation that
suspected terrorists will be apprehended forthwith, President Bush has
signed an executive order establishing a military tribunal to try these
murderous thugs.

Vladmir Putin: Formidable Man, Friend or Foe
By Dorothy Anne Seese

Who is this man who came out of political nowhere to lead the new
Russia? He certainly is not the vodka-sotted puppet that Boris Yeltsin
was during his years as so-called president of Russia.

Until his appearance as the new Russian president, Putin spent most of
his career as a member of the KGB.  He doesn't look like a mean man, he
doesn't have the evil look of Stalin, Khruschev, or any number of
Arab/Islamic leaders.  Actually, his face is rather bland, at times
almost boyish.  Good spies, which is what Putin was for many years,
never look like Hollywood's idea of a spy.  And not all devastating
leaders look like Saddam Hussein or the late Ayatollah Khomeini (who
looked like an escapee from an insane ward).

Farewell to Arms
By Gregg Bish

Much has changed in the world, much that some find distasteful, and that
others find poignant and sweet. Times have changed enough, however, that
time has come to re-evaluate the shape of the world. Much good has come
to pass. Much more is coming.

Our nation was stabbed in the heart with a bitter dagger September 11.
The wound was deep. Rather more like a cancer patient hearing of the
onset of a dread disease than a victim of a vicious assault, however,
America responded. The response surprised many, though often those who
were surprised were younger, less informed and less understanding types,
whose life experience has been limited to a world shaped in the days
following the Viet Nam War. It has seemed uncanny to these types that
America, instead of blindly lashing out, or retreating into a forced,
brooding isolationism, has been reborn.

The Laughing Sheiks of Saudi Arabia
By Doug Patton

"The American government... stands by its commitment to a just peace in
the Middle East.  We are working toward the day when two states - Israel
and Palestine - live peacefully together within secure and recognized
borders as called for by the Security Council resolutions."
George W. Bush, 43rd President of the United States, addressing the
United Nations General Assembly, Nov. 10, 2001

With those few words, President Bush ushered in a new era and a new
American attitude toward Israel.  No American president has ever used
the term "Palestine" to refer to anything other than the area of the
Middle East occupied by Great Britain until 1948, at which time that
occupied territory became the sovereign state of Israel.  Our official
position has always been to speak in terms of a prospective "Palestinian
state" or a "Palestinian homeland," but never of "Palestine."

Inner City 101 in Israel's Defense
By Star Parker

Not again. Will not even the assassination of Israeli Cabinet Member
Rehavam Zeevi spark renewed loyalty from America to defend our friends?

In looking for the right answer regarding those that President Bush has
called our friends, maybe Secretary of State Colin Powell should take a
lesson from inner city gang members.

"I got your back" is a popular summary as to why these street thugs so
willingly go to jail or die for their hommies. The saying means that
even when the road gets tough, you can depend on me.

New World Disorder Psychology
By SARTRE

Events since 911 have created a deep seeded dread towards the future in
the minds of many Americans. What was attacked on that day was not
buildings alone. The deaths that were snuffed out were not the only
victims from the act of terror. The feeling of anguish has overtaken
much of the public psyche, as the tone of the continuous reporting and
reflection has exposed an uncertainty, that few would have admitted,
just a short time ago. Control over your environment and circumstances
is a goal that most strive to achieve. In the fleeting moments by an act
of absurd action and applied depravity, security of our world view was
shattered.
