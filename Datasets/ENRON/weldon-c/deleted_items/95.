Charlie & Steve,

I work in the power structuring group and need your assistance in pricing a gas swap.  The details are as follows:
	Jan 1, 2002 - Dec 31, 2012
	transco z6
	priced at mid
	
I'm sure I am missing some inputs since I am new to this.  Please tell me what else I need to provide you.  Could you please give me one price with basis included and one without basis.

Thanks,

Steve
