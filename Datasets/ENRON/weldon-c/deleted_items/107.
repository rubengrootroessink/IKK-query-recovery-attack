hope you'll find the time to share in our nation's observance of Memorial D=
ay, when we pause to reflect on the cost of the free lives we live today.  =
 I will be marking the day with military veterans gathering at the White Ho=

 wars.  I will then go to Arlington National Cemetery, to lay a wreath at t=
he Tomb of the Unknowns.  It will be a high honor and I will be there on be=
half of all the people of the United States.   Later that day, I will join =
with veterans in Arizona for a commemoration and national moment of remembr=
ance.  Most of us know war veterans; I had the privilege of being raised by=
 one.  Usually, they are reticent about their experiences.  It is often dif=
ficult for them to think back on those names and faces, on the ones who nev=
er lived to be called veterans.   Read and listen to the complete radio add=

EAT OF THE FAITH-BASED INITIATIVE  By Star Parker   The faith-based initiat=
ive is our latest proof that politicians are great entrepreneurs in finding=
 ways to expand the scope of government, their own power and control over o=
ur lives. This particular initiative should be of concern to all because, i=
n the best scenario, it will only waste money. In the worst case, however, =
it will be destructive to our nation.   Although for President Bush this in=
itiative is a crusade to reach minorities, welfare programs have already do=
ne enough damage in black America. Government dependency has created an env=
ironment in which black illegitimacy rates have soared seventy percent. Thi=
s time the victim of government intervention will be the black church.   Ho=
wever, there is an even deeper concern facing us than this.   Read the comp=

S NEVER A REPUBLICAN  By Doug Patton   U.S. Sen. James Jeffords of the Peop=
les' Republic of Vermont has officially changed his party label and gone ho=
me pouting, as the catchy question is thrown around Washington, "Who lost J=
effords?"   Who cares? Good riddance.    I know. Jeffords' announcement las=
t week that he would switch his party affiliation from Republican to Indepe=
ndent (read "Socialist"), has sent the Republican leadership into apoplecti=
c fits -- and rightfully so. After all, we're talking about a gigantic shif=
t in control of the United States Senate. The count will now be 50-49-1, th=
ereby putting the Democrats back in the driver's seat for the first time in=
 six years. Control of the Foreign Relations Committee will go from Jesse H=
elms to Joe Biden. The Judiciary Committee chairmanship will pass from Orri=
n Hatch to Patrick Leahy (another Vermont lefty). And the thought of Ted Ke=
nnedy chairing anything makes my skin crawl as much as the next patriotic A=
merican.   Read the complete article at http://gopusa.com/dougpatton    [IM=
AGE]  [IMAGE]POLITICAL PROBLEM OR MORAL PROBLEM?  By Dorothy Anne Seese   L=
et me begin this with a quote that is attributed to John Adams, the second =
president of the United States: "Statesmen, my dear Sir, may plan and specu=
late for liberty, but it is Religion and Morality alone, which can establis=
h the Principles upon which Freedom can securely stand. The only foundation=
 of a free Constitution is pure Virtue, and if this cannot be inspired into=
 our People in a greater Measure, than they have it now, they may change th=
eir Rulers and the forms of Government, but they will not obtain a lasting =
liberty."Maybe that explains why this nation has more laws and less liberty=
, more crime than virtue, more government and less respect for the nation. =
   We the American people are losing our liberties daily.  Our constitution=
al guarantees are being judicially overruled and legislated out of existenc=
e, all for our own good (so they tell us) or in the alternative, it's "for =
the children."    Read the complete article at http://gopusa.com/dorothyann=
eseese    [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]BRUCKHEIMER'S PEARL HARBOR IS AN EXAMPLE OF FAILE=
D READINESS  By Rick Erickson   On Memorial Day, when Touchstone Pictures i=
ntroduces Jerry Bruckheimer's Pearl Harbor, viewers who remember the shock =
of Japan's raid on Hawaii will undoubtedly leave the theater unsatisfied wi=
th Hollywood's glamorization of an American catastrophe, and the members of=
 Americans for Military Readiness want to set the record straight as to wha=
t was left out of the movie -- the glaring example of our unreadiness for w=
ar.   As early as February 15, 1941, Admiral Husband Kimmel, Commander of t=
he Pacific Fleet, scoffed at suggestions that Japan would ever provoke a wa=
r with the U.S. by executing a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. Such a scen=
ario was to the U.S. Command what Gordon Grange described in his, At Dawn W=
e Slept, as "a mouse kicking a cat." According to Grange, U.S. Naval Comman=
d at Pearl Harbor focused less on prevention of such an attack and, instead=
, was blindly steadfast that, should Japan actually carry out such an unlik=
ely invasion, the cat that was the United States would pounce mercilessly u=
pon the mouse regarded as Imperial Japan.   Read the complete article at ht=
