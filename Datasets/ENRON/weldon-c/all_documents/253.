If you can leave the airport by 1:30, make it to dook by 2:00, leave dook
by 2:45 (3:00 at the absolute latest), then you'll probably be alright.
Cameron should take all of about 10 minutes to lose your excitement over,
then you can walk around and check out all the ugly pussy that plagues the
campus, then see a bunch of yankee butt pirates circle jerking in the quad,
buy yourself a championship t-shirt with jiz all over it (but they won it
with heart!), you can be out of there in 45 minutes easy!!  Without any
traffic delays, you'll be east of Raleigh where we can meet at 3:45 or 4:00
at the McDonalds at Hwy 42 and I-40 (write that down, it's about 10-15
minutes east of Raleigh).  If you get stuck west of Raleigh in a traffic
snarl, you could be there for 1-2 hours.  I work in Chapel Hill on
Wednesdays and won't drive back on I-40 if it's after 3:00, I take a back
route.

Let me give you directions to Orton just in case, it's easy.  I-40 from
Raleigh to Wilmington, as you approach Wilmington take a right at a big
light on Smith Creek Parkway (new since your day, it's just before Market
Street), go about 1-2 miles and it will end, take a right on 23rd St, pass
the airport on your right, road will come to an end again, take a left, I
think this is Hwy 133 South which takes you around/through nig-town
Wilmington, cross the Cape Fear River and follow signs to Southport staying
on Hwy 133 South which will go straight to Orton, follow the signs into the
gate and the house is on the right once you enter the gate.  From the
airport without major traffic it will take a good 2 1/2 hours without
stopping, say 3 hours with a pissing 4 year old!!

Gate House phone number 910-371-9240
My work number 919-552-6506
My cell phone 919-662-6711

Wesie and I will try to leave at 3:30 so we can meet at 4:00.  Call me when
you get to the airport and let me know what the deal is.  I'm in Chapel
Hill on Wednesday so you could reach me on my cell phone.  I won't get
e-mail on Wednesday.
