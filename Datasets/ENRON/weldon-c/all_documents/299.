Charles,

The attached table contains monthly flows to the referenced Southwest Gas 
meter points off of El Paso, Kern and PG&E.  As I indicated earlier, SWG may 
have deliveries off of Socal which we would not be able to see.  Also, there 
may be unidentified SWG meter points not included in the attached file, and 
we are missing some days of data so the actual numbers may be a little 
higher.  Finally, if this data is used for pricing/hedging analysis, one 
should be careful which prices they use for comparison.  SWG territory in 
California would be subject to California pricing, while that closer to the 
producing basins would be priced differently.  In addition, Southwest Gas 
owns transport capacity on El Paso, such that they were really only 
vulnerable to San Juan or Keystone price fluxuations, and not Socal.  You 
could only make a hedging estimate if you knew their transport capacity, 
which I do not (it is available on El Paso's website).  Anyway, that's all I 
have.

Mat
