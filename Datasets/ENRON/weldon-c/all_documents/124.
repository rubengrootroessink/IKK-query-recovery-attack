Hey V,

I had a great time this weekend!  This was a very momentous occassion,
and I'm glad we were able to share it with you and Melissa.

Please let me know what I should read to get more up to speed on the
business side of things.  In return, I'll answer any questions you have
on politics.  I've now been involved with Republican politics for almost
exactly seven years, so I have a little bit of experience with politics
and leadership. :)

When will Melissa have your pictures developed?

Bobby
