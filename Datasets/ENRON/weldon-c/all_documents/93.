No, did you?

Hard to believe that its' still falling after today's news:

HOUSTON, Jan. 4 /PRNewswire/ -- Dynegy Inc. (NYSE: DYN - news) today
announced that the company will significantly exceed previously forecasted
 fourth quarter recurring earnings of $0.22 to $0.25 per share. In
addition, the company also reaffirmed that it is comfortable with the upper
range
of current
estimates for 2001, which will represent an increase over 2000 of about 30
percent.
