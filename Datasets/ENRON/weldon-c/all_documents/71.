UT Team,

I just got word that Monique Salazar and Nadeem Abdullah have already 
accepted the offer to come to Enron.  So please call and congratulate them 
rather than cultivate.
The only formal decline we have received is from Scott Conner, so unless you 
would like to try and sway him to Enron there is no need to contact him.

Also for clarification - if you have a candidate name next to your name in 
the team roster please contact only that candidate.  (Ex. David Haug will 
only call Niraj Parikh)  If you do not have a candidate name next to your 
name please call all the candidates on your team list. (Ex. Jennifer Martinez 
will call all 5 candidates on her team)  The hope is that these candidates 
will feel a sense of belonging and want to come to Enron.  The candidates 
will appreciate someone from Enron who takes the time out to call and it 
shows our people care.  

If you have any further questions please feel free to contact me anytime.

Kristin

Subject: UT Candidate Cultivation

Hi UT Team - 

We're in a critical time in the recruiting process as offers have been 
extended and we need to make sure they're accepted!  In order to ensure 
cultivation of the UT candidates who received offers, we have assigned each 
of you to a team of candidates to call at least once before the Holidays.  

The teams are designed so there is an executive lead, an experienced Enron 
representative, and/or an associate.  All members of the cultivation team 
should contact each candidate assigned to their team each week.  If the 
executive leads want to develop a more detailed strategy for their 
cultivation team that is fine.  Each week the associate should report to me 
about the candidates on their team, letting me know about any issues or 
concerns.

The deadline for offer acceptance has been extended to January 2nd!  Please 
communicate this to all candidates and make sure to let them know if the 
paperwork is not in our office by January 2nd we will assume they are 
declining.

If you have any questions or do not feel that you have the time to devote to 
this, please let me know so we can replace you.  I really appreciate your 
help!  Don't forget to call everyone at least once before the Holidays, 
because they will be leaving campus for Christmas break soon!
