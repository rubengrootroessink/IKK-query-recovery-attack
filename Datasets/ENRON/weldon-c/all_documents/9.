Charlie,

I will give you a call tomorrow A.M.  I just got back from Boston, so I
didn't get your e-mail until now.

Jonathan,

Hope you had a good Thanksgiving weekend.  I'd like to catch up with you
today if possible regarding recruiting etc.  Can I reach you by phone.
If
so, where?
You can call me toll free at 1-800-97-ENRON and follow the menu.   My
extension is X57229 or you can use the voice activated system.


Thanks,

Charlie
