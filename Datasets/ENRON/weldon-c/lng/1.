Charlie,

Could you please refresh the prices for the collars and the fixed prices as of friday's close?  We are trying to go out with the term sheet this week so we may need to reprice it once or twice.  Can you get this turned around Before this afternoon?  Please let me know.

Thanks for the help,

Eric
