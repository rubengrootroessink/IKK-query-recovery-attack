Attached is a coding quick reference sheet (Coding.QuickRef.xls) that I hope 
will be useful in the coding of expense reports and miscellaneous vendor 
invoices that may pass your desk.  I have also attached a copy of the "GPG 
SAP Coding Block" (Coding.doc) which explains the different SAP coding block 
requirements.  SAP coding must now be used in order to process expense 
reports and vendor invoices.  If you need additional coding information, 
please contact one of the following ET&S General Accountants in Houston:
 
      

If I have left anyone off of the distribution list that you think may benefit 
from these coding aids, please forward this note to them.  Also, if you have 
any suggestions or comments to add or subtract (or correct) information that 
may make the coding quick reference sheet easier to use, please let me know. 


Thanks,

Allison
