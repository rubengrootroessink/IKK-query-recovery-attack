Please remember, all expense reports should be prepared using the new SAP 
REPORTING FORM ONLY.  All codings, be it expense reports, invoicing, etc., 
will have to be submitted with our new company number (0060) and our new Cost 
Center Coding (Formerly RC), which is 111089.  You may want to keep these 
numbers handy.

In order to retrieve your new expense report forms, please follow the 
following instructions:

 Go to our home page on the intranet
 Select SAP
 Select "Quick Reference Tools" located on the left side of page
 Scroll down to "Account Payable Forms"
 Select "SAP Expense Report Form"
 Save to your drive

All reports must be completed by access through the intranet.  Please do not 
copy your forms for each report has it's own report number, i.e. 061600, 
062200, etc.

If you should need assistance, please do not hesitate to call, I will gladly 
stop by and assist you.
