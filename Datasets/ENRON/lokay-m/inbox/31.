How about 3 back to back 30 minute sessions on Thursday 3/21/02 during the afternoon and then the same on Friday morning 3/22/02.  I will set up some test, "What if cases".  I would recommend they come to my work station ECN 3947.  Let me know if this is okay with the group.

Thanks 
PT

30 minutes...is that all we need?  Let's schedule all the marketers:  me, Lorraine, TK, Paul, Mark, and Kim.  Thanks.

Michelle,

A few months ago, TW Marketing and Fac. Planning had a meeting to discuss TW CAS system issues. At this meeting, you indicated that the TW Marketers would like to have some training on CAS. I have discussed with Perry Frazier & he would like to set up 30 minute one on one hands-on training sessions with each individual. 

Can you coordinate with your team & identify a list of TW Marketer's who would like to have CAS training? I will work with Perry to schedule the training times.

Thanks Ramona
