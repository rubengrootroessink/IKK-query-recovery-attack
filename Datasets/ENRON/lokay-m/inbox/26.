The following is a level "A" cost estimate to make TW/ Lonestar existing interconnects bi-directional.


TW/ Lonestar at Ward County ( 50 to 60 mmcf/d)


According to Operations this is already bi-directional . The only things are required on this one is to take the flapper out of the check-valve 
and blow down the gas in 5.33 miles of 12".

Cost of gas loss& labor = $8,000




TW/ Lonestar at Pecos County ( 100 mmcf/d)

A): TW/ Lonestar interconnect


	Scope: On this one we need a bi-directional valve skid using the existing meter run.
	Cost of material& labor= $ 195,000


B): Pecos Compressor Station

    	 In order to make this interconnect bi-directional we also need to make the station ( two-compressor units) bi-directional.
	
Scope: Install outlet from Lonestar I/C to inlet filter with 12" piping& valves. Unit discharge would be modified to
tie in to West Texas-20"
	
Cost for material& labor= $ 330,000.
	
If you need more accurate costs ( B -release) please let me know .

	Total cost estimate for this project = $ 533,000.
