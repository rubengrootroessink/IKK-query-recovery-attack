We have spaces available at the Allen Center parking garage for $94.00 per month, payroll deduction. If you are interested in acquiring one of these spaces, please reply via e-mail by 5:00, Thurs.,July 19th.

If you are currently parking at a garage that is subsidized by Enron you will need to turn in that access card before you get your Allen Center access card. We will give you a permit to get out of the garage at the end of the day.
