Hi!? How was Christmas?? Caroline and Roy installed the Elmo phone yesterday 
- she was mesmerized!? How does Meghan like hers?

We will be in town Friday and Saturday - do you guys have any plans?? We are 
coming back here Sunday morning so I can rest up before having to work a 
whole 4 days in a row!? You and I will have to go to the Galleria (if you can 
handle that), since I have a gift certificate for Crate and Barrel.? There is 
not one here yet.? Also, remind me when I'm there to bring you the Urban 
Retreat stuff.

Bonnie
