Thanks to the teamwork and dedication of the Transwestern Commercial team, we're well positioned to meet or exceed our 2001 goals.  While all of our employees have contributed to the success of TW's first six months of 2001, several individuals have made significant commercial contributions:

Lorraine, Michelle, and Jeff have successfully negotiated the Red Rock Expansion contracts within a record one month's time.  The value of these transactions is expected to have a positive impact on our revenue starting next year and into the future.

TK has negotiated creative interruptible transport deals at the California border, sold significant Park N' Ride volumes and negotiated several short-term index deals with a sharing mechanism that have had a strong impact on our bottom line.
 
Jeff  has also structured several long-term index-to-index deals and developed a hedging strategy to lock-in market rates.    

Thank you for your hard work and innovation.  It demonstrates your commitment to excellence and to our Company.


Stan
