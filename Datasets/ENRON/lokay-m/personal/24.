This is funny - I've been thinking about you too!  We went to Zio's
yesterday - met Kenna there.  I had not been there since you guys.  It was
good to see her.  I had lunch with Randa the other day too - miss watching
you two communicate - ha!
What's going on with you?  You like your job?
I finally bought a Kenny Chesney CD and that song "hello", I remember with
you how I did not want to like that song .... but I love it and him.  I'm a
little slow to come around sometime - ha!
Are you still shopping?  How's Meghan?  I bet she's talking!!!
Update me when you can!
BYE!
Marilyn
