You would need to go to clickathome.enron.com, sign in, then go to internet options.  Click on the order button next to Time Warner and then select yes for the question asking if you are a current TW subscriber.  Let us know if you need additoinal assistance.

I already have Road Runner cable internet service at home.  How can I be under the "discounted Enron plan?"  Do I need to cancel and start over or can my bills automatically be reflected?  Thanks.
