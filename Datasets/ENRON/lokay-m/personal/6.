Dannetta is at 1100 Louisiana (your old Tennessee Building).  Is that the
one on the tunnel level?  What time will we need to be there to get a seat?
That will be fine with me.  I'll let Danetta know.

How about somewhere in between?  Where's Danetta?  Maybe Treebeards in
Interfirst Plaza?

We haven't set a place yet, do you want to try Angelika in the Bayou place
or meet somewhere closer in between?  I am at 700 Louisiana. (Bank of
America)
