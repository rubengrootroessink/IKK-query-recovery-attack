I have included four files.  They are labeled as to what they are.  The
color files reflect the original's sepia tone, the B&W ones should be
obvious.  The 72dpi would be the ones to email for people to look at on the
computer (should show up as full sized on most screens) and the 300dpi would
be ok for printing.  If you want to use the picture for desktop wallpaper,
let me know your screen resolution (i.e. 1024x768); I will make a file
special for that.
