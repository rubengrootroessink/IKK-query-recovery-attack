I hope this email finds all of you high and dry.  However, many people were not as fortunate.  

Community Affairs is taking a count of Enron employees that were displaced or affected by the flood.  Please email me or call me at x33597 if you were affected.  

If you want to make a monetary donation to the Red Cross or any other agency, I am pleased to report that the Enron matching gift program has been expanded to match your donation.  

Enron is looking into other avenues to assist the victims but, we need to hear from you first.  Please email me or call me if you or a fellow employee has been affected.  

Enron will be making determinations based on this information and how to proceed and assist the victims.  

I can be reached at x33597 if you have any questions.
