Thanks for the story!  Have an all day meeting today, and my grandparents are going back to Maryland.  I did get a pair of pj's for Meaghan at Gymboree - the red ones with the little pique heart design.  Hope you did not get them too!

A man asked his wife what she'd like for her birthday. 

"I'd love to be six again," she replied. 

On the morning of her birthday, he got her up bright and early and off 
they went to a local theme park.  What a day!  He put her on every 
ride in the park:  the Death Slide, the Screaming Loop, the Wall of Fear- 
everything there was!  Wow!  Five hours later she staggered out of the 
theme park, her head reeling and her stomach upside down.   Right to a 
McDonald's they went, where he husband ordered a Big Mac for her along 
with extra fries and refreshing chocolate shake.  Then it was off to a 
movie - the latest Star Wars! 

What a fabulous adventure!  Finally she wobbled home with her husband 
and collapsed into bed. 

He leaned over and lovingly asked, "Well, dear; what was it like being 
six again?" 

One eye opened, "You idiot, I meant my dress size." 

The moral of this story is:  If a woman speaks and a man is there to 
hear her, he will get it wrong anyway.
