yes... and there are so many choices in that area.. I have bought and 
returned 2 types...  I'm pushing that we do something.  Bob Martinez gave me 
the task of running Technical Brown Bag sessions for Upper Management to show 
them technology.. Palm Pilot type hardware was what my first session was 
going to be on..

Jean, does this mean that all of the other team members with Palm Pilots will 
be changing over to something else?

Audrey -- the right answer is probably yes I mind .. But, I do not have a 
problem with her going and doing it.  I understand where she is coming from, 
and I do not like being a road block.  Do you know what she is planning to 
purchase... and also she understands we are in the process of selecting a 
standard..

Jean, Michelle would like to get to go ahead and get one now.  It would be 
easier for her to go out this weekend and purchase one and expense it out.   
Would you mind if she does?

Let me know...

good... Thank you.  

Also, we (GPG) do not have a standard for Palm Pilots.. actually, from what 
I've found it doesn't look like they are leaning towards Palm Pilots.. Can 
Michelle wait for the standard? or we can just order her one now.   I'll 
still trying to get a time frame for this standard.   I'l ask again today.
