With deep regret we announce that Joe Sutton, Vice Chairman of Enron, has 
decided to leave the company.  Joe has indicated his desire to pursue other 
opportunities in the energy asset development and operations business.

Joe has been instrumental in making Enron a global company.  We will miss his 
energy and enthusiasm.  We wish Joe the very best as he pursues new endeavors.

Ken and Jeff
