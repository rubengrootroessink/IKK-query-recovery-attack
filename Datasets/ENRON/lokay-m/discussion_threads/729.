I have replace the old basis differential with Michelle's new numbers and 
migrated the program to
production.  So TW Deal Analysis is using the new basis differential now.

DBA,
Please migrate up_TWDA_deal_analysis in etstest/twprod01 to dbo, and to 
etsmo/twprod01, mojo/twprod01.
Grant execute to developers, TWDP in etstest
Grant execute to TWDP in etsmo and etsmojo

Gary,
Per user request, we need to replace basis differential for TW Deal Analysis 
forward pricing that was hard coded
in the program with the latest numbers as stated in the e-mail from Michelle 
Lokay.  We are working on
accessing the information from revenue management table as soon as the data 
is available in the database. 
This change does not impact any other applications.
Please approve it and forward this request to ets dba.

Thanks,
Mei-Ling
