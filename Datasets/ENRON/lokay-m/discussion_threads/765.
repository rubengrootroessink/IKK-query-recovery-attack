Kevin Hyatt, Director for the TW Commercial Team,  is a member of the Enron 
Kids Committee.  He has again volunteered to be the GPG coordinator for those 
of you interested in adopting or contributing to the Enron Kids Christmas 
campaign.

This year the Committee has adopted HISD's Burrus Elementary.

If you're not familiar with Enron Kids, this is the program where Enron 
adopts all the kids in a local school where a majority of the families are 
living near or below the poverty line.  The adoption consists of groups of 
employees selecting one or more children and buying a full set of clothes 
(including socks, underwear, shoes, and an overcoat) plus a toy and book.  
The approximate cost is $125 per child adopted.  All the gifts are 
distributed by the Committee during a party at the school several weeks 
before Christmas.  In a lot of cases, our gifts are the only things the kids 
will get this year.

If you're interested in participating--  Here's what you do:

Reply via email to Kevin Hyatt with your anticipated $ donation.  Kevin will 
be in charge of collecting funds and coordinating the buying of presents.  If 
you (or your spouse or significant other) want to volunteer to assist with 
the shopping, please let him know.  Kevin will provide a daily update of the 
donations total.  Please let Kevin know your donation by Tuesday November 
14.  We will adopt the maximum number of kids on Wednesday November 15.

Thanks for your assistance.
