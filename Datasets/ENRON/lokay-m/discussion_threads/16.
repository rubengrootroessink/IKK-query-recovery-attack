Subject: WEFA Short Term Outlook


Hi Sarabeth:

At Peter's request I am sending you a copy of our most recent short term
outlook and a presentation on the short term outlook.  I will send a copy of
our long term presentation in a separate email.  Please feel free to pick
and choose what you would like me to talk about.  The material is clearly
too much to discuss in the hour we have.

I look forward to meeting with you.

Best Regards,
