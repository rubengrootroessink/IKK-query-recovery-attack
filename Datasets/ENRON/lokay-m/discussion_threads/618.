The 10/13/2000 memo announcing the opening of the  6.0.1 version of XMS 
Expense Management System was intended for current users of XMS only.  We 
sincerely apologize for this miscommunication.

The rollout schedule to the balance of Enron employees will be announced 
shortly, along with information on available training.  Please visit our 
KIOSK this Thursday and Friday on the main floor of the Enron Building for a 
product preview.
