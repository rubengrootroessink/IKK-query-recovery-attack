Hi Little Mell!!

Vegas is nice.  It has visibly changed since we were last here.  Lots of new
Hotel/Casinos.  The concert was very good.  We came in very late due to
travel delays and missed the first 3/4 of Lenny Kravitz and all of Cheryl
Crow.  My Lagerfeld satchel didn't survive it's gate check ordeal (all the
contents were fine though) so I now have a reasonably nice new bag a'la
Southwest Airlines baggage office.  I'll give you details later.

Last night after the concert, we grabbed a couple of hot dogs and wandered
through some casinos.  While waiting for Steve to go to an ATM I killed some
time by putting a $20 into a nickel slot machine and won 7500 nickels
($375).  Later, while waiting for Steve to use the facilities, I won $40 on
a quarter slots machine.  So far, so good.

Give me a call.  The number here is 702-414-1000.  Ask for Danny Yee's room.

I love you,
Jim
