Overdraft protection.  What does that really mean?  If you're talking about a 
checking account, it means you won't pay a penalty for insufficient funds.  
What about intellectual overdraft protection?  The penalty is much greater if 
you have insufficient funds in your mental bank account.

Making frequent visits to Resources in the ThinkBank is solid protection 
against intellectual overdraft.  In Resources, the ThinkBank tellers have put 
together a list of books and software -- sort of a knowledge "nest egg" for 
you to build on.

Resources.  We've got your intellectual capital covered.
