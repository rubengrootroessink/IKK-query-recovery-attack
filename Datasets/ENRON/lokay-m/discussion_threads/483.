This is a reminder that we are going to begin Phase I of the Windows 
2000/Outlook Project.  In this phase, we will be gathering information about 
the hardware and software that you are using within your group.  

The process will begin with an email inventory.  You will receive an email on 
Monday, September 25, with the subject of W2K Inventory-Please Open.  All you 
need to do is open the email message.  Because the Marketing group's 
inventory was performed by Omaha, they should not open the message.  This 
email will do a quick inventory of applications you have installed on your PC 
or that you may access from the network, as well as your desktop hardware 
specifications.  The information gathered from this email will be stored in a 
Notes database for reporting.  It is very important that you open this email 
from your primary workstation.  Please do not open it remotely, or if you're 
checking someone else's mail.

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please feel free to contact
