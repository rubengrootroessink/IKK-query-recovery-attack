Michelle Lokay,

Don't forget to register for the year end Chili Cookoff to be held a week 
from Tuesday, November 14th at Garden in the Heights (3926 Feagan).  From 
5:00 p.m., $10 in advance for HEA/NESA members or $15 at the door and for 
guests buys you a sample of all the chili offered and all the beer necessary 
to swallow it!  It's the last event of the year, so send in your registration 
today. There is still time for any additional teams to enter, but space is 
limited.  Call the HEA office for details if you don't have the previous fax 
reminder.  See you at the Garden on the 14th!
