Subject: 2001 Plan Locations

At the 2001-2003 Capital ( Officer review) meeting Marketing agreed to review 
the Operations Capital Budget in order to confirm that the expenditures were 
consistent with the Business Plan. (i.e. from a Marketing perspective, are we 
spending our capital dollars where we anticipate doing transactions)  In 
order to help this process, attached is the Plan with locations identified.  

Please review this list for any inconsistencies  and inform Dave Clements of 
any concerns.  If at all possible, provide your comments by close of business 
Tuesday, August 22nd.

Thank you
