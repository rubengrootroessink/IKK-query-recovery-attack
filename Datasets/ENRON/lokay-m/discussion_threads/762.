Agave Energy - Agave purchased a seasonal winter transport agreement for 
7,000 MMBtu/d on the Atoka lateral through May 2001.  This effectively sells 
out the Atoka and actually bumped some gas Duke/GPM had been delivering to 
the pools for free.  Incremental revenue for this deal is $70,200.

EOG Resources - The new EOG well on the West Texas lateral has been connected 
to TW but we are waiting for them to install an EFM device before we allow 
the gas to flow.

Burlington Resources - The letter agreement amending the interconnect and 
operating contract for the Burlington Val Verde plant on the San Juan lateral 
was sent this week.  We will adjust the prior period and remaining 2000 
invoices once the contract is signed.

PNM Capacity - FERC issued a tolling order on our request for rehearing in 
the PNM capacity docket.  We had asked for rehearing of the order limiting 
TW's acquisition of capacity to summer-only months.  There is no deadline for 
the Commission to act on our request so we'll have to wait to see when it 
appears on the docket.

PG&E - Representatives visited TW's offices this week to discuss a number of 
things including western gas flows, storage, winter and summer peaking 
capability, and EDI interface possibilities.  In response to TW's request, 
Rod Boschee indicated they may increase their capacity to take TW gas from 
300,000 up to 400,000 MMBtu/d!!  They would like to implement this change 
before Thanksgiving (in time for bid week) but are waiting on some upper 
management approvals first.  To date, they have been very pleased with the 
efforts of TW personnel to clean up the various substances contaminating the 
PG&E line.
