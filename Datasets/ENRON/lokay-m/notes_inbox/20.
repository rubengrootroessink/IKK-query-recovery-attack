Subject: Meeting on Thursday at 2:30 p.m.

I have set up a meeting at 2:30 p.m. on Thursday (in Houston) to discuss a 
few issues between NNG and TW regarding:
 The TW expansion (and how NNG may provide some interconnecting supply and 
transport for this).
 Interconnects with TW/NNG--how we are valuing this capacity....and those 
with El Paso.
 Direct access to Permian Pool pricing---I need to get a better understanding 
of this, and maybe get some ideas from others if there is a way to get 
Permian   Pool access instead of Waha.

Let me know if this time doesn't work for you.  Thanks.
