Do you have Conoco's account?  We talked about this last week.  Did you say 
that you were working-on a termination letter on the three Conoco contracts 
and how their ROFR works with our notice of termination of the evergreen?  
They are:

 20747 mainline 10,000/d termination 2/28/02 month to month evergreen
 20748 mainline 10,000/d termination 2/28/02 month to month evergreen
 20835 san juan 20,000/d termination 2/28/02 year to year evergreen

They all can be terminated by either Party with 365 days notice prior to the 
end of the primary term.
