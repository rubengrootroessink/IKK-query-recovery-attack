Dear Bob,

Good try, but I need more, so I'll help you out.

Term : Initial term of 5 years, with an additional 5 year term at e prime's
election. Notification 6 months before end of contract
Interconnect: On Pressure Control, range from +/- 85,000. Any significant
change in volume to be communicated between two control
 rooms if after hours.
Gas can be transported from West Texas, Central Texas, or Midcontinent Pools
to this TW-Nichols connection.
OBA will allow for +/- 10,000 mmbtu/day, maximum of +/-100,000 mmbtu/d
Imbalance outside of the above will be moved on/off the next business day
Up to 30,000 mmbtu/d can be exchanged from TW-Nichols to other Xcel/Utility
plants on NNG. Transport charges will be same as this
 transport. The TW-NNG exchange volumes will count toward the annual
commitments. Any volumes above this amount will be
 at mutually agreed upon transport charges.
Any volumes above the 10 BCF specified in Bob's brief letter, will be made
at a mutually agreeable demand charge plus fuel if applicable.
Transport fuel is currently at 1.31%, but could change in future years.


Is there storage on TW ???
The JV between NNG and E Prime will not preclude this agreement.
