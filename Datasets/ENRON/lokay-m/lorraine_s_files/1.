Lorraine,

The change to paragraph 1 is fine. It looks like the language that we wanted taken out of paragraph 4(b) is still in there, however. In addition, there are other parts of paragraph 4(b) and also paragraph 5 with typos/unnecessary language. I've cleaned up paragraphs 4(b)and 5 in the attached version. The attached version is ok with me. Hopefully, NGPL won't have any more issues.
