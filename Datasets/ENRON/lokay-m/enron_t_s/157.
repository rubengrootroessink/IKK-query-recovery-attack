Today, at Antioch Park, we'll thank all of our employees for a great Week of Caring and a great start to a successful United Way Campaign.  I hope you are planning to attend. 
 
Part of today's celebration includes a contest between Enron business units.  Each business unit will build a structure out of Lego's starting at 11:00 a.m.  
 
Please bring your noisemakers, cowbells, clapping hands, megaphones and loud voices to cheer on Team ETS!  The winning Lego structure will be determined by the amount of applause/noise each team gets.  With your help, we're a shoe-in for first place!
 
I hope you'll join Team ETS and me today.  The Lego contest begins at 11:00 a.m. and judging is scheduled for noon.  We'll need LOUD support during the judging!  Free lunch from Chidk-Fil-A will be served from 11:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m.  
 
I look forward to seeing ETS out in full force!
 
Stan
