From the Desk of Lee Ferrell

I am very pleased to announce that Vince Stohmeyer has transferred to Risk Management & Reporting as a Sr. Marketing Analyst reporting to me.  He will be responsible for directing the final stages of the Caminus Risk System implementation.  Upon "going live" with Caminus Vince will manage the system from a front office perspective, responsible for deal capture integrity and reporting. 

Vince has an accounting background and has been with Enron for 5 years in various accounting positions, most recently as Sr. Accounting Specialist in ETS Gas Accounting.   Prior to joining Enron Vince was an auditor with F.E.R.C. in Washington D.C..  Vince has a B.S. in Business Administration from the University of Akron and a Masters in Finance from Texas A&M. 

I am equally pleased to announce that Richard Riehm accepted the position of Account Director effective July 16, 2001 reporting to me.  He will primarily be involved in developing transportation optimization models associated with our Revenue Management efforts.  Richard comes to us from Burlington Resources where he held various gas marketing positions since 1990.  Richard's most recent position was Manager of Supply and T&E.  Richard's experience includes optimization of gathering, mainline transportation and scheduling activities associated with Burlington's natural gas production.  He has held several marketing positions with Burlington over the last 11 years.  Richard has a B.B.A. Finance from the University of Texas.

Please join me in welcoming Vince and Richard to the Risk Management & Reporting Group.
