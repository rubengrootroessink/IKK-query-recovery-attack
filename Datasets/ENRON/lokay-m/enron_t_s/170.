Enron's United Way Campaign officially kicks off Monday, July 23, with the Leadership Giving Campaign. The employee campaign will kick off Monday, August 6. As part of the Campaign, ETS will participate in the Enron-wide Days of Caring. 

ETS' Day of Caring will be held on Thursday, August 9, benefiting Neighborhood Centers, Inc., our adopted United Way agency.

ETS will have projects at two NCI facilities, with a morning shift and an afternoon shift.

Please save Thursday, August 9, on your calendar for ETS' Day of Caring. Details will be communicated shortly. 

Besides helping our community, there is lots of fun in store on ETS' Day of Caring. 

Please contact Kimberly Nelson (x33580) to schedule your volunteer time.
