The ETS Mechanical Services, Compression Services and ETS Mechanical Integrity groups have been renamed ETS Power Services to better describe the focus of our business.  

ETS Power Services is responsible for data gathering and predictive maintenance analysis, coordination of scheduled & unscheduled maintenance, outage planning, overhaul management & inspection. We also supply the day-to-day mechanical expertise for over 700 reciprocating engines, gas turbines and compressors throughout the ETS system.  The name ETS Power Services helps to better define our role and the expansion of our business to support other Enron entities, as well as companies outside Enron in the power and natural gas industries.

Please feel free to contact me at 713-646-7624 should you have any questions, or if the ETS Power Services group can help support your engine, gas turbine or compressor maintenance needs.

John R. Keller
Vice President
