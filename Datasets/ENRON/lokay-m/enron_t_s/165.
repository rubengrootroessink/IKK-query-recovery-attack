ETS' Day of Caring is Thursday, August 9.  To date, we have over 65 ETS volunteers - thank you!  More volunteers would ensure ETS' success.  

On Day of Caring, ETS will be working at the Harbach Ripley Center located at 6225 Northdale.  Transportation will be provided to and from the Enron building to the Center.  Bright yellow t-shirts are available for all of our ETS volunteers.  T-shirts can be picked up at EB1638E.  

Box lunches will be available for Day of Caring volunteers at the Enron building.  Morning volunteers will get their lunch when they return to the Enron building, and afternoon volunteers will get their lunch when they leave for the Harbach Ripley Center. 

Specifically, during the Day of Caring morning and afternoon shifts, we'll be painting, replacing baseboards, cleaning and interacting with the seniors and the children at the Center.  All of these activities are indoors.    

There have been several questions about whether you have to take vacation to participate in the ETS August 9 Day of Caring.  You DO NOT have to take vacation.  However, please make sure you coordinate your time out of the office during Day of Caring with your team and/or supervisor.

Please sign up to volunteer for Day of Caring via the on-line link below, and indicate which shift, morning or afternoon, you prefer.  

Please contact Kimberly Nelson (x33580) with questions.  

Pull out your working boots and let's have some fun together at ETS Day of Caring!
