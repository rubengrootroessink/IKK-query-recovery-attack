I am pleased to announce that Tim Johanson has accepted a position as Account 
Manager for the Minneapolis LDC team and will be relocating to Minneapolis.  

Tim brings many years of experience to this position having worked on both 
the gas and power side of the business for NSP.  He is currently working in 
the power/gas development group in Omaha for John Dushinske.  Tim will 
continue with some of these responsibilities in his new role in Minnesota.

Tim received his B.S. in Mechanical Engineering/ Business Administration from 
the University of Kansas and his MBA in management from the University of St. 
Thomas in St. Paul, MN.

 Please congratulate Tim on his new assignments and relocation to Minnesota.
