The following items were discussed in this week's corporate change control... 

May 24
From 2:00 - 3:00 p.m., Enron Network Services will perform maintenance on the bridged network for gas control.  They are replacing the csu/dsu's in both routers.  There will be a total disruption of the gas control DRA segment to Omaha during this maintenance.

May 24
From 9:00 p.m. through 5/25 at 8:00 a.m., the Corporate Server team will move the Personic Workflow applications to new servers.  This will result in a complete outage of the HR recruit tracking application.

May 26
From 10:00 - 11:15 a.m., Enron Network Services will be migrating power to the switches in the EB28 floor wiring closet.  There will be an intermittent disruption while the switches are being moved.  This only affects devices on EB28.

May 26
From 6:30 p.m. through 5/27 at 12:00 a.m., the Messaging team will remove and re-install Norton Anti-virus on nahou-msmbx05v.  They will also install Norton Anti-virus on all Houston and remote Exchange servers.  There may be intermittent disruption of messaging services during this maintenance.

June 14
At 7:00 a.m., the Gas Measurement Team will deny access to the existing MIPS system (192.168.175.62).  The new PGAS gas measurement system will be enabled on Monday, June 18.  During the period from June 14-18, only gas measurement support staff will have access to the MIPS server.  If you have any applications that access the MIPS system, contact Sandy Jones or Jeff May for more information. 

FYI:	There will be freeze on all network changes from June 2 through June 16.  This includes changes to Enron Infrastructure (switches, routers, routing changes, new sites, etc.).
