The Pasadena Chamber of Commerce has selected the Enron Clean Fuels Methanol Plant as "Industry of the Year" for 2001.

The selection was based on the plant's community activities; awards/recognitions received related to safety, environment and quality; organizations supported by plant employees, and the positive impact the plant has on the local business community.

Hats off to the employees of the Enron Clean Fuels Methanol Plant for this special recognition!
