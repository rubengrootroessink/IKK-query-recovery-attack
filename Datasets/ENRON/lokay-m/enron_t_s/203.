Effective immediately, Joe Hartsoe, currently Vice President Federal Regulatory Affairs, will become Vice President Regulatory and Legislative Affairs for ETS.  Joe will be located in the Enron Washington D.C. office.

As previously announced, Shelley Corman will lead the ETS Market Services organization.  I've asked Shelley to continue to lead the ETS Communications function as well.  Shelley is now Vice President of Market Services and Communications for ETS.

Shelley and Joe will report to me.

Please join me in welcoming Joe to ETS and wishing Shelley well.
