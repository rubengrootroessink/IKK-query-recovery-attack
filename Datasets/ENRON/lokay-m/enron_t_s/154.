ETS proved it's winning ways by being named Enron's Champion Lego Builder at the United Way Appreciation Lunch this past Friday.
  
I appreciate your participation in the United Way campaign.  To further continue the amazing efforts, I encourage you to participate in this worthy effort if you have not already done so.  Enron is a Pacesetter Company for the United Way and in that spirit, lets blaze the trails and have a rate of 100% participation.

To date, ETS has over raised more than $242,00 which is about 70 % of our total goal of $346,000 with a 60% rate of participation.  I am pleased to report that my group has a 72% participation and I commend your efforts.  I would like to aim for 100% participation by Wednesday evening.  If you have not logged on to make a difference in the Houston community, we encourage to make a donation today or by Wednesday noon.

As added incentive to encourage a 100% participation rate, a drawing for Astro's tickets will be held Wednesday night. The tickets for the lottery are for great seats (near the Astro's dugout) on September 13th versus San Francisco, game time 7:05 pm.  

To participate, log on to <http://cr.enron.com> today to make your contribution.  You'll need your GIS number to make your contribution. Once you have completed your donation, contact Julie Armstrong by email and your name will be placed in the lottery for the Astro's tickets.  We will have two drawings with two tickets giving four lucky people a night at a Astro's game.

Thank you for your participation in the United Way.
