Once again, it's time to find out what you think about your work experience=

=20
help make it better.  That's why we want to check your pulse.  In fact, we'=
ve=20
changed the name of last year's "Excellence Through Communication" employee=
=20
survey to The Pulse.  We believe The Pulse more accurately captures the=20

There are a few things we want you to remember about The Pulse:

solutions.
In last year's survey, you identified several problem areas regarding=20
internal communications, workload and performance management. We've already=

acted on many of your recommendations.  These are a few of the things we've=

accomplished in direct response to your input:

through the initiation of:
=01  Table Talk sessions with ETS Office of the Chairman, which give employ=
ees=20
the opportunity to have frontline discussions,
=01  The "Innovation Series," which invites employees to share their ideas=
=20
openly and ensures management commitment to evaluating ideas,
=01  E-Speak sessions with ETS leaders to exchange ideas, and
=01  Our name change to Enron Transportation Services to recognize our most=

strategic asset - you.

=01  We made workload planning and management training/development availabl=

ETS employees to address workload issues, the greatest ETS concern in the=
=20
survey.

=01  We improved the consistency of performance management, the survey topi=
c=20

Performance Evaluation Process (PEP) system and the Performance Review=20
Committee (PRC) process to all levels in ETS at mid-year in 2000.
