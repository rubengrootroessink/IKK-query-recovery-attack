Thank you, ETS!

Friday's United Way Appreciation Lunch was great fun.  Team ETS, Lisa Sawyer, Rod Hayslett, Colleen Raker, Brad Holmes, John Millar, John Keller, Marcello Minotti, and Pam Daily, made us proud.  

On top of being named Enron's Champion Lego Builder, ETS was also awarded Most Ambitious.  The picture in the link below captures our awesome team and our winning structure.  

Now let's show the rest of the organization that ETS employees are as generous as we are innovative, bold and talented.

At Friday's lunch, I challenged the other business units to raise more money for United Way and to have a greater participation rate than ETS.  We can't let this happen because I don't want to bake cookies for Mark Frevert!

To date, ETS has raised more than $214,000, which is about 62% of our total goal of $346,000.  That's the good news.  

The bad news is our participation rate is less than 50%.  I know we can achieve 100% participation.

If you've given to the United Way, THANK YOU.  Your contribution makes a difference right here in our community.

If you haven't made your contribution, you still have time.  Please log on to <http://cr.enron.com> today to make your contribution.  You'll need your GIS number to make your contribution.  

If you don't have your GIS number or need assistance with keying in your contribution, please call Gina Taylor (x37681) or Sarah Haden (x53383).  

Please remember that contributions made last year don't automatically roll over to this year.  You'll need to enter your 2002 contribution on-line.

Your contribution to the United Way has an impact on one out of every two lives in the Houston community.  

Don't miss the opportunity to help Houston build its future.

Stan
