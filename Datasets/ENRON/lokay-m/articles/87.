Quick Change in PG&E NW IT Allocation

Within hours of a FERC vote yesterday ratifying proposed changes in its 
interruptible transportation (IT) queue, PG&E Gas Transmission Northwest 
announced new procedures effective today. 

The Commission rejected shippers complaints to the new scheme and accepted 
PG&E NW's tariff sheets as of Oct. 25, saying the revisions were "generally 
in accord with industry practice and will simplify capacity allocation 
procedures." 

Under the revised tariff PG&E NW said "IT capacity will be allocated as 
follows: 

 First to shippers paying maximum rate; 

 If there are more confirmed IT nominations from shippers all paying the 
maximum rate, then IT capacity will be allocated pro-rata to the confirmed 
nominations.~ For example, if the capacity constraint were at Station 14, a 
shipper with a confirmed nomination paying maximum rate from Stanfield to 
Malin would be allocated capacity pro rata with a shipper with a confirmed 
nomination at the maximum rate for service from Kingsgate to Malin. 

 Second to shippers paying discounted rates or negotiated rates at less then 
the maximum rate. The discounted/negotiated IT space will be allocated on 
highest to lowest total revenue (rate x mileage).~ For example, a shipper 
with a confirmed nomination for service with a total revenue per Dth of $0.11 
would be awarded capacity ahead of a shipper with a confirmed nomination for 
service with a total revenue of $0.10, regardless of the path nominated. 

 Discounted IT shippers having the same total revenue will be allocated space 
on a pro ration of their confirmed nominations." 

Questions can be addressed to PG&E NW's transportation coordinator at
