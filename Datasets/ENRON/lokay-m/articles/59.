result in the first ever monthly average price of $5.00 at the Henry Hub (s=

Table 1) and the first of potentially many months at or above that price.

Gas Storage=01*New Record Lows
CERA estimates that storage inventories in the United States crossed into=

the previous 1996 record low of 2,245 Bcf (see Table 2). More records will

platforms. This rate would leave US inventories at 2,518 Bcf at month=01,s =
end, a
record low by 87 Bcf.

For October, CERA expects a slight increase in the injection rate from last=

year.
Injections of 5.5 Bcf per day on average this year would be enabled by dema=

(1989) to 8.5 Bcf per day (1998). Even if injections reached toward the upp=

heating
load will keep intense pressure on Topock prices. Differentials in the rest=

of the
West will strengthen as local heating loads begin to absorb enough supply t=

ease pipeline bottlenecks (see Table 3).

Differentials in the East, which have traded in a narrow range this summer,=
=20
will
likely reach slightly higher levels with the start of the heating season in=
=20
October.
However, exposure to pricing disconnects will remain low until later this=
=20
year.
CERA=01,s outlook by region follows:

* Rockies. Pipeline bottlenecks out of the Rocky Mountains
this summer should begin to ease as heating loads climb
during October. CERA expects that as local demand limits
pressure on pipeline capacity, differentials will narrow.
October differentials should average $0.50 per MMBtu.

* San Juan. The resumption of flows on El Paso=01,s southern
system, combined with production outages, has relieved
some of the access constraints on San Juan supply.
Seasonal declines in Rockies to Southwest flows and the
beginning of the heating season should narrow October
differentials to $0.35 per MMBtu.

* Permian and Mid-Continent. The continuing pull on
supplies from the West will support Permian prices, and the
Midwestern pull on supplies will support Mid-Continent
prices. CERA expects a differential to the Henry Hub of
$0.06 per MMBtu for Mid-Continent supplies and $0.11
per MMBtu for Permian supplies.

* Chicago. The delay in the in-service date for Alliance from
October 2 to October 30 will take some gas out of the
Chicago market next month. This delay, combined with the
need to build Midwest storage inventories, should sustain
the recent increase in differentials from the $0.05=01)$0.08
range to above $0.10 per MMBtu. CERA expects October
differentials at the Chicago citygate to average $0.11.

* Northeast markets. Gas prices near $5.00 have increased
the fuel cost of delivery from the Gulf Coast into the
Northeast, raising the floor level for differentials to near
$0.30 per MMBtu. The beginning of the heating season and
the lack of new capacity into the New York citygate should
support differentials above the floor during October, at near
$0.40 per MMBtu.

Canadian Markets=01*Outages Affect Supply
Outages have affected supply thus far in September. Both British Columbia a=

Drilling has been adversely affected over the past several weeks by wet=20

but rig utilization is beginning to climb again to previous levels. More th=
an
8,400 gas wells are expected for this year.

Slight Drop in Export Demand
Eastern Canadian demand is still down approximately 200 MMcf per day, with
cooler-than-normal weather reducing the need for air conditioning. In the W=
est
however, cooler-than-normal weather has accounted for an increase in demand
for heating requirements of about 200 MMcf per day.
Exports are down slightly in September compared with September 1999, with
PG&E GT-NW off 110 MMcf per day. Northern Border is running even with
September 1999.

Storage Picture Brighter in Canada
Storage injections in eastern Canada have picked up, with inventories now
expected to reach the five-year average of 210 Bcf. In the West, inventorie=
s=20
at
the end of the injection season will not only be above the five-year level =
but
should be even with those of 1999, at 250 Bcf.

Wider Differentials Holding
After widening substantially in August to US$1.17, the AECO-to-Henry
differential has closed back to a more typical level of $0.60 in September.
September=01,s AECO price should average US$4.15 per MMBtu (C$5.79 per
gigajoule [GJ]), increasing in October to US$4.35 per MMBtu (C$6.07 per GJ)=
.
