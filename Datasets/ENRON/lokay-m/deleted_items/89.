I would like to have a short "touch base" meeting with all of you (or your designees) to share information on our current industry/company resources that we use for market intelligence purposes.  As you know, we are working on moving into the Dynegy environment, and I would like to pass on to you my information and any contacts that you may need in the future in dealing with vendors or internal publication representatives.

I have reserved Room 696 (Video) in Omaha and 42C2 (Video) in Houston on Friday, January 18, at 3:00 p.m. for a 30-45 minute exchange of information.  If you cannot attend, please give me a call.  

Attached is a listing of corporate resources that Northern Natural Gas Company was using over the past year.  We can use this for part of our discussion.  Bring any questions that you may have.
