Paul/Sandy

Please let me know ASAP regarding Burlington Resources Trading, Inc (DUNS #175671007), who is looking to acquire temporary capacity released from ENA for the remainder of January.  Here are the terms as provided by Transwestern's Marketing Dept:

Term: 		1/10/01 - 1/31/01
MDQ:		25,000/day
Res Rate:	$0.0650
Comm Rate:	$0.0011	

 The potential exposure would be $36,355.  They hope to get the deal posted/awarded by 10am this morning.


Thanks,
Elizabeth
