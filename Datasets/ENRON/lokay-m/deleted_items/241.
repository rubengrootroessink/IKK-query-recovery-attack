Could you please get with T.K. and have her put in the appropriate rates in CBS for the 
following contracts:

CR #		Shipper				Effective		MDQ
27834  		 WGR 				4/1/02  - 10/31/02 	  5,000
27835  		 WGR 				11/1/02  - 12/31/03 	10,000 
27847		Tenaska			2/27/02		            10,000
27848		Sempra				3/1/02-3/31/02		15,000

25374 		Oneok				3/1/02 - 3/31/02 -  I extended the rate of $.05 through March 31
27420		WTG				3/1/02 - 3/31/02 -  I extended the rate of $.065 through March 31  


I believe these are all the new contracts that have been done recently.  If I missed any
please let me know.

Thanks!
