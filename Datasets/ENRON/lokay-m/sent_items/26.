Dear Michelle:
 
Thank you for registering for the Weather Trading Europe prize draw
sponsored by Corporate Insurance and Risk. We're pleased to let you know that your name
has been drawn as one of the winners.
 
In order to confirm your free delegate pass for the event, please respond to
this email with all your contact details. We will then register you for the
event and send out information about booking your hotel room. We suggest
that you do this as soon as possible as we are quickly running out of space
at the hotel.
 
If you are going to be unable to make the event, please let us know, as we
will pass on the ticket to another prize draw entrant. Your place is
transferable to one of your colleagues, so if you can't make it feel free to
pass on the ticket to one of your colleagues and simply let us know.
 
We look forward to seeing you in Amsterdam.
 
Regards,
Allison
