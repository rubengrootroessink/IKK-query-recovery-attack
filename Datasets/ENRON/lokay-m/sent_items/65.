Dear Tech Support,

Last year I upgraded from Boyfriend 5.0 to Husband 1.0 and noticed a
slowdown in the performance of flower and jewelry applications that had
operated flawlessly under Boyfriend 5.0. In addition, Husband 1.0
uninstalled many other valuable programs, such as Romance 9.9,and installed
undesirable programs such as NFL 5.0 and NBA 3.0.

Conversation 8.0 no longer runs and Housecleaning 2.6 simply crashes
the system. I've tried running Nagging 5.3 to fix these problems, but to
no avail. What can I do?

Dear Desperate,

First, keep in mind that Boyfriend 5.0 is an entertainment package,
while Husband 1.0 is an operating system. Install Tears 6.2 and enter the
command <C:\ I THOUGHT YOU LOVED ME>.

Husband 1.0 should then automatically run the applications Guilty 3.0 and
Flowers 7.0. But remember, overuse can cause Husband 1.0 to default to
Grumpy Silence 2.5, Happy Hour 7.0, or Beer 6.1. Beer 6.1 is a very bad
program that will create Snoring Loudly.WAV files.

DO NOT install Mother-in law 1.0 or reinstall another Boyfriend
program. These are not supported applications and will crash Husband 1.0.

In summary, Husband 1.0 is a great program, but it does have a
limited memory and cannot learn new applications quickly. You might consider
buying additional software to improve performance. I personally recommend
Hot Food 3.0 and Lingerie 6.9.

Good luck.
