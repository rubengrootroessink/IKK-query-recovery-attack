This looks good from the Commercial side.  I am assuming that when a customer uses the "View Printable Page," that printout header cannot be frozen.  Otherwise, this is what we are looking for as far as viewing this spreadsheet on line.  When the formatting issues are resolved, I recommend we move this to production.  Thanks.

I added an extra "Printable Page" button on the page so that the entire page can be printed out.
Michelle, please let me know if you still have problems to get to the TW Unsubscribed Capacity page. Sorry about the delay.

Thanks.

I have an issue with this format.  When you print it the header nor disclaimer no longer shows up.  We have run into this issue before, and that is why we have not put it in frames.  We may need to look at another format to cover the on-line users and the customers that print this report.  This has been an on going issue on-line when you scroll down you lose the header.  The printing customers won't think to highly of this format.  My suggestion is lets try look at another format that will cover both sides (printing and viewing).  Jeff /  Perry, we may have to get together and discuss this issue.

Please go to http://twdev.ets.enron.com our testing site to view the modified TW Unsubscribed Capacity web page and see if this is what you guys want. I removed the borders because the table header and  records page are in the different frames, it is very hard to adjust them exactly straight into the same columns.

Thanks!

Jeff
