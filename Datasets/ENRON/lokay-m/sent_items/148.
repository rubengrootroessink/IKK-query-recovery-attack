More information.  The Questar (Southern Trails) tie-in is for one day only, 04/02.  The Ignacio to Blanco line, from La Plata, will be down over 700 million (which is pretty much the whole lateral) from 04/02-04/05.  Talk soon, Michelle.

Here's that e-mail from Northwest Pipeline which they sent to their customers.  Did you find out anything regarding the impact with the Southern Trails tie in.
