Houston and Omaha ETS Employees,

As you know, Enron reached a settlement with Dynegy, which allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire Northern Natural Gas.

To discuss this action, please attend a floor meeting with Stan on Monday, January 7, from 1:30 - 2:30 in the Enron building in the area of 3922.  Omaha employees, please gather in 227. 

See you then.
