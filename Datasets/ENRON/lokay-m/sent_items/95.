Sorry, I was out of the office yesterday.  We are currently not utilizing these systems.  Are you actually deleting them and can we resurrect if needed?

Michelle,
I left a message on your voice mail about the use of TW Deal Profitability and TW Deal Analysis.  Is anyone in Marketing still using these applications?  We are looking to stop the support of the applications if there are no users.

Thank you,
Kimberly Carter
