Please go to http://twdev.ets.enron.com our testing site to view the modified TW Unsubscribed Capacity web page and see if this is what you guys want. I removed the borders because the table header and  records page are in the different frames, it is very hard to adjust them exactly straight into the same columns.

Thanks!
