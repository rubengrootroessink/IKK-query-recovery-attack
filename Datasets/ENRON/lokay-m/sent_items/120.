You guys have probably already noodled on this, but if you haven't, maybe it's worth organizing a meeting next week to discuss the above storage project and benefits / risks to TW.

For instance:

Risks:
Red Lake connection to Kern cuts into TW forward haul market


Rewards:
expands TW's Park n' Ride capabilities (we offer more capability and back it with a storage position)
better PnR rates over the short term than what the storage can offer
more backhaul business on TW mainline (i.e. Citizens Utilities)
Compression ops agrmt w/ Aquila


Let me know if you'd like to get together for a brainstorm session.  Bids are due to Aquila by 3/15 and there are some financial caveats to discuss.
