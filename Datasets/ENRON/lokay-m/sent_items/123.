01/00  Mojave 842,128 TW 842,127   Difference = 1...waived, due to rounding
03/00  Mojave 912,977 TW 912,917   Difference = 60...corrected to agree with Mojave's volume
06/00  Mojave 606,535 TW 606,534   Difference = 1...waived, due to rounding
09/00  Mojave 1,674,721 TW 1,662,566  Difference = 12,155...occurred 09/28
