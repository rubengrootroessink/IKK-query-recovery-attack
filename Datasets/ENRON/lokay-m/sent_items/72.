What do you think of this itinerary?  You guys would leave San Antonio and pick us up at Hobby for the same flight to Orlando.  On the return trip, we leave 1 1/2 hours before you, but you guys have a direct flight.  The trip is Friday through Saturday, for 8 nights.  The flights are getting more limited and have increased again!  Let's talk soon.
