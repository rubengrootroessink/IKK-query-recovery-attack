Hi...how are you?  Things are going well, but I sure miss you guys !  I left 
you a vmail last night saying that I can't attend Poli's party.  Jim, Meghan 
and I are going to be on vacation in California.

Let's talk soon and think about me when you guys go to Uncle Tongs!

Subject: Hi!!


Wish you were here!  Can't believe you got away so fast!
How's your job - is it you?
How's Meghan? (sp right?)  Bring her to Poli's party .... I hope you come.

Write me and let me know how you're doing when you can.  Did you buy a
house?
I really miss talking to you (and lunch!).   All my lunch partners are gone.
Linda's wedding is coming along.  The wedding is planned for Sept. 9 - be
here before you know it.
I hate it that I didn't get to say bye to you - you were always a pleasure
to talk to you - always "up" - which is good!
BYE - write when you can.
Marilyn
