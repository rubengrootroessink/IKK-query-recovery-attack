Michelle,
Could you please amend Oneok Bushton Processing, Inc. transportation contract
#25374 to extend the term through November 2000, at the same rate and MDQ that
we have for October 2000.

If you have any questions please call me at 918-732-1374, and my fax is
918-588-7499.

Thanks,
Andrew Pacheco
Scheduling Manager
