Hi Mike,

Great to hear from you.  Would have gotten back to you sooner, but we just 
got back from vacationing in California.  Sure was tough to leave 
temperatures in the 60s and return to the 90s!

How are things going?  Did they ever implement Modular Forecasting?  Bet you 
love those Displays!  Sounds like you guys are pretty busy...too busy to be 
speculating about me!  I am in marketing for Enron, using my trading and 
financial background.  The timing was perfect and my commute is so much 
shorter!

Keep in touch...and shouldn't the Aggies be in the Top 20?!?!

Michelle,

Since I didn't get to say good-bye, I wanted to see how you were doing?  It
sounds like you landed on your feet pretty fast.  To be nosey, were you able
to get a severance package and then become employed that quickly?  The
speculation around here was that you already had the Enron job (i.e., may
have given notice already) and Will severed you because of the soft landing
scheduled (heck, I would have loved to be in your situation).

I guess you know that Will officially left the company.  Another speculation
was that he tried to garner a severance package himself, but they turned him
down (of course he was furious, but I don't know if it was true).

What exactly are you doing with Enron?  Is it in a Marketing role?  Randa
mentioned that you are travelling some, but didn't really know what your job
function entailed.

Periodically keep in touch because inquiring minds like to know (and I might
use you for some research).
