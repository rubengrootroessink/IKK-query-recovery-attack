Subject: base differential for TW deal analysis



Michelle,

Our dba has loaded TW base differential to test database from revenue 
management data base
after Vernon added TW to his regular update.
The spreadsheet is the latest NYMEX and base differential for 4 areas of TW 
as of 11/28/00.
Please take a look.  If no problem, I'll apply the same logic that I used to 
create this spreadsheet
to TW deal analysis program.  I'll dynamically get the latest price from the 
table based on 
receipt point location.
Please let me know.
Thanks,

Mei-Ling
