Sorry I wasn't here for your email last Friday...I try to leave by 4:30!!!  
Yes, let's allget together soon...call me! 

Jim and I did see some movies lately:  Men of Honor with Cuba Wadding Jr was 
a good tear jerker, Charlie's Angel was humorous because we weren't expecting 
much, and Bedazzled brought us back down to earth.  I would recommend all 
three!  Meghan got some DVD's and her two favorite that she watches every 
night are Toy Story 2 and Little Mermaid 2...have your girls seen either one?

Subject: Movie Suggestions


Hi Michelle,

How are you?  I was talking to Marilyn the other day.  We thought it would
be a good idea if we can try to get together one day.  Anyway, I haven't
asked you for movie suggestions since a long time.  I've seen "Perfect
Storm" and "The Patriot" .  Do you know of any others?  Or even if they are
still the theater ... I could add them to my future rental list.  Thanks.
