Yes, and as a matter of fact...I'd called the Benefits Help Line recently and 
they'd said "No Coverage" on Dental.  I think I am all set.  If you find out 
otherwise, let me know!  Thanks.

Please confirm that you changed your Dental election to No Coverage.  I 
recall a phone conversation, however, need definite clarification.

Thank you,
