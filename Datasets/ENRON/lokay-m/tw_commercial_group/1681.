To follow up on our phone conversation this morning...you had found an additional 7,692 MMbtu/day of West Texas receipts available during the months of 11/02, 12/02, 01/03, and 02/03.  Let's allocate this to the remaining 2 shippers still looking for West Texas supply.  Please allocated on the administrative contract as follows:  3,735 will go to PP&L (will still need additional 2,000) and 3,957 allocated to Calpine (still needing 2,514).  The remaining volumes will have locations to be determined in the "east of thoreau" areas.  Paperwork forthcoming.  Thanks.
