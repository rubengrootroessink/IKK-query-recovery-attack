Steve / Julia, if this is OK, will you please forward to all Market Services 
members.
thanks

Pursuant to our conversation today, we will implement the following change in 
the way Market Services allocates the California delivery points:

Historically we have allocated the border as an area.  Effective 9/18/00 
until further notice, we will allocate the border by individual points.

If SoCal windows TW down to a number less than the standard 750,000 MMBtu/d, 
then we will allocate shipper noms down to the window total.
PGE and Mojave points will be individually allocated to their capacities as 
well.

If the opportunity arises whereby gas allocated at Needles can be moved to 
Topock or Mojave, then Market Services should work with the Shippers to 
accommodate their needs.

The West of Thoreau area should not exceed the 1,090,000 MMBtu/d capacity 
constraint.

Any questions can be directed to Steve January, TK Lohman, or Darrell 
Schoolcraft.
