Subject:	Waiver of Price Cap on Capacity Release

FYI

I have been in several discussions lately where the statement has been made that waiver of the price cap on capacity release expires in September 2001.  This is incorrect.   Order 637 states that the Commission is waiving the maximum rate ceiling in its capacity release regulations until September 30, 2002 for short-term releases of capacity of less than one year beginning upon the effective date of this rule. 


(i) Waiver of maximum rate ceiling. Until September 30, 2002, the maximum rate ceiling does not apply to capacity release transactions of less than one year. With respect to releases of 31 days or less under paragraph (h), the requirements of paragraph (h)(2) will apply to all such releases regardless of the rate charged.
