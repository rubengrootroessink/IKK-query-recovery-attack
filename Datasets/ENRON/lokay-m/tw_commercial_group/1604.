Transwestern is in agreement with extending your Firm transport from Griffith to PG&E, with alternate delivery at Southwest Gas.  The term is November for 15,000 at a rate of .05, all inclusive with zero fuel.  Regulatory needs a paragraph substitution (see below) and unfortunately Contracts will issue a new number because of the changes.  Please submit a new Service Request and I will approve.  Thanks.


Substitute:

"For the term of this amendment, if any quantities nominated by Shipper hereunder cannot be scheduled because of an event of Force Majeure, Transwestern shall further discount the rate applicable to such quantities nominated but not scheduled to zero."

In place of:

For the term of this Amendment, Transwestern agrees to provide an additional discount to the Shipper for quantities that could not be scheduled hereunder due to an event of Force Majeure, as reasonably determined by Transwestern, rendering the supplies unavailable.  The additional discount will be an amount equal to any quantities made unavailable multiplied by the Discounted Rate.
