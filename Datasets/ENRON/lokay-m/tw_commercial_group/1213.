George,
I guess I worded my questions wrong.  No, We have nothing installed at this location.  We're using a sampler now.
Thanks,  Arnie

Earl,
Do you know where we stand on getting this equipment installed?  Besides the GC, Del Mar, Water Monitor, there is still no power at the location.  We also have no positive shut-in or overpressure protection.  According to Bennie, EOG plans to tie in another well.  We're already flowing 30mmcfd.  I appreciate anything you can do to speed this up.
Thanks,  Arnie

Arnie:  As per our conservation 03-08-01 reguarding the status of the EOG Pronghorn station, they are now in the process of putting a second well into that line, the volume is not known at this time, but we still have not heard anything about a time line for getting the GC, Del Mar, dewpoint instrument or building.  We talked to Rich last month and he in return talked to Earl, and it is my understanding that it is in motion,  I  just want everone to know any changes out here , like the addition of a new well.
