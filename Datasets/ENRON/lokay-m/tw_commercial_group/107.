To:  All Enron Gas Pipeline Group Operations Employees

Today, environmental laws govern virtually all aspects of Enron Gas Pipelin=
e=20
Group's (GPG) operations, including the design, construction, maintenance a=
nd=20
operation of our pipeline and storage facilities.

At the same time, GPG=01,s environmental performance receives greater scrut=
iny=20
as environmental regulations increase and the public demands better=20
stewardship of the environment.

Accordingly, GPG has affirmed its commitment to environmental responsibilit=
y=20
by adopting a formal policy concerning environmental compliance as well as =
a=20
comprehensive environmental compliance program.  This commitment reinforces=
=20
GPG=01,s positive and long-standing environmental record.=20

One of the key areas that could effect our performance is in the realm of=
=20
=01&air compliance.=018 Over the past decade, the natural gas industry has =
faced=20
continuing challenges to meet more restrictive requirements in air emission=
s,=20
operating parameters and reporting associated with the compressor engines=
=20
that move gas through GPG=01,s pipeline system.  All of these conditions ar=
e=20
extremely important, and every employee within GPG should be doing everythi=
ng=20
possible to maintain compliance within the permitted limits.  Non-complianc=
e=20
is not an acceptable alternative.

In order to help us focus on our responsibilities in this regard, we have=
=20
asked representatives of the Environmental, Health and Safety activity;=20
Technical Services; and the Legal Department to partner in developing an=20
appropriate action plan to help all of us maintain our =01&air permit=018=
=20
compliance.  You will be hearing more about these action plans in the comin=
g=20
weeks. =20

Thanks for doing the great job you are doing, and for making our company th=
e=20
success that it is.

Sincerely,

Stan Horton
Chairman & CEO
