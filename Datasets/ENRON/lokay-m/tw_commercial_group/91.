Subject: CORRECTION to TW Park n Ride Invoice File - July 2000


The file sent out yesterday had several inconsistencies that were brought to 
my attention by Cynthia and Terry. 
The corrected billing is attached. I regret any inconvenience this may have 
caused.


Please note: 
A changed from previous billing file... USGT was charged 3 cents/d for stored 
quantities(The quantities stored from 7/25 -7/31 did not trigger the tiered 
rates). 
The daily rate was suspended  for gas day 7/01 thru 7/09 for both Duke Energy 
and Sempra due to the station 4 compressor outage.  Invoice amounts for these 
shippers reflect this adjustment.
Reliant (PO 27060) carryover quantity of 1,514 MMBtu from previous month - 
$1,362.60 (This qty remains from April business)
Sempra (PO 27255) carryover quantity of 6,000 MMBtu from previous mpnth - 
$5220.00 ( This qty was parked in June)

If you have any questions, please call me at  x36486.
