Attached is the final version with your 2 sentences added.  Please print off
two copies, have them executed by TW and send them to me.  I'll sign them,
get them executed by Natural and return a fully executed copy to you.  If
you use a color printer, KMI's lightning bold will show up in red.  Thanks
for your cooperation.

Transwestern accepts all Natural's suggested changes except for the
following 2 sentences which we will add to the end of Paragraph 1:

Transwestern shall have the right to review and approve the design
drawings as soon as they become available and prior to the beginning of
construction.  Transwestern's field personnel may observe the testing of
the over pressure protection equipment and/or emergency shut down
activations.
