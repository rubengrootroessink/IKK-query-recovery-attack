Sold 15,000 MMBtu/d of stranded firm transportation to Burlington Resources from LaMaquina to Blanco for October at $0.05 plus fuel, which gives TW an incremental revenues of $24000 not already in plan.  This transaction was executed through EnronOnLine.
Because the Griffith power plant is not passing the PP&L facility's testing, PP&L executed a firm transport agreement from East of California to California.  The incremental firm of 20,000 MMBtu/d is from Griffith to PG&E Topock for October at $0.10 plus fuel, resulting in an additional $62,000 also not in the plan.
