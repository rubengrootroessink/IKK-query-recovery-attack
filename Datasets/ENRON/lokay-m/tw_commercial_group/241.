Subject: FERC Meeting This Morning - Order on El Paso Capacity Allocation



Chairman Hoecker announced that FERC will hold a special meeting Nov. 1 to 
issue a proposed order detailing possible remedies to the California 
wholesale market based on two investigations currently underway.

Only one item was discussed - an order resolving the Amoco complaint over El 
Paso's capacity allocation.  In the order, the Commission finds that El 
Paso's allocation of delivery point capacity at Topock is unjust & 
unreasonable.  The Commission directs El Paso to assign primary point rights 
to its shippers using a one-time assignment process outlined in the order.  
If elections for primary point capacity exceed available space, El Paso will 
pro rate the space and allow shippers to select other primary points in an 
iterative fashion until all shippers have primary point rights equal to their 
firm capacity rights.  Chairman Hoecker said this case illustrates the fact 
that overbooking pipeline capacity is even more problematic that the 
overbooking of airline capacity.
