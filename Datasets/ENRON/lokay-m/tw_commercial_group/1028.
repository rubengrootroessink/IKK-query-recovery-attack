I have arranged it where if you guys are at the California border and are delivering to another California point, there will not be a charge for fuel.  This will be applicable for Griffith, PG&E, and Needles...

Michelle,
I just wanted to clarify something in your e-mail.  In your note you state the 
fuel is discounted for interruptible transport from Griffith to PG&E.  I 
thought in our conversation you said the fuel for would be discounted for 
deliveries to PG&E and Needles.  Is the fuel discounted to zero for our IT 
deliveries to Needles?  I know it is less reliable, but it provides us with 
another option.  Let me know.

Thanks,
Joe

Joe,
This is to confirm your interruptible transport for the months of July
and August.  The commodity rate from Griffith to PG&E is .2792 and the
commodity from PG&E to Griffith is .2442.  The difference is that one
delivery is California versus east of California (further explanation on
pages 5 and 5a of our tariff).  The fuel will be discounted from 4.5%
down to zero.    Hope this helps.
