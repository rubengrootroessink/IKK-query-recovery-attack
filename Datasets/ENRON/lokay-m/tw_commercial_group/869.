Sorry I didn't get to talk to you earlier...we have been in one meeting after another!

What's going on?  The receipt points are in the Blanco area at the Bloomfield Compressor, so that would include the Transcolorado point.  The NWPL interconnect is further north, where we are currently fully subscribed.

FYI, one of the meetings I was in, was a strategy session on what to do what all our remaining capacity (of which part of that is what you are now interested in).  Transwestern is thinking of posting an open season utilization this space with California capacity.  

It sounds like you guys are definitely interested and because I am out of the office next Monday, please call me on my cell phone 713-907-3198.

Michelle:  I did talk to Rick Maceyka (my boss) regarding our conversation about the lateral space on TW.  We are definitely interested.

Is the receipt point in SJ pool good from either NWPL or Transcolorado? 

Thanks, Terri
