Western #27834 is .095 (one-part plus fuel), and Western #27835 should only be for 5,000 not 10,000 and is at a rate of .13 (one-part plus fuel).  Oneok is correct at rolling month by month.  TK, please update these rates.  Thanks.

Could you please get with T.K. and have her put in the appropriate rates in CBS for the 
following contracts:

CR #		Shipper				Effective		MDQ
27834  		 WGR 				4/1/02  - 10/31/02 	  5,000
27835  		 WGR 				11/1/02  - 12/31/03 	10,000 
27847		Tenaska			2/27/02		            10,000
27848		Sempra				3/1/02-3/31/02		15,000

25374 		Oneok				3/1/02 - 3/31/02 -  I extended the rate of $.05 through March 31
27420		WTG				3/1/02 - 3/31/02 -  I extended the rate of $.065 through March 31  


I believe these are all the new contracts that have been done recently.  If I missed any
please let me know.

Thanks!
