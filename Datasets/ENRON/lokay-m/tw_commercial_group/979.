Oneok has triggered the ROFR for 20,000 dth/day to California, beginning February 2002.  The capacity is posted on the Transwestern's bulletin board until September 21 and Oneok will tell us within 24 hours if they are interested in matching. 
Citizen's Griffith power plant had been burning full capacity at 120,000 dth/day.  Starting on Sunday, August 12, the facility will be down for approximately 6 days for final maintenance before full Commerical operations.
