Hey team,

Attached, is the location of a Red Rock spreadsheet in our common file that I would like for each of you to update for the Red Rock expansion shippers.  Please fill in the missing blanks.  You will notice that the last column is for the current status.  This column is of particular interest and importance as we manage the final negotiations of each contract over the next two weeks.  Please update it for the last few conversations that you have had with the customer and summarize the gist of your conversation.  Steve will want to have a meeting with us every Friday (beginning this week) to review the status of each contract.  Also, the bottom of the spreadsheet is for the potential shippers we are talking to about the remaining 50,000/d.  Please complete this section also. 

You will find this spread sheet on our common directory at:  common on'gthou-du01' (S:)/Marketing/TW_NNG/TW Desk/Red Rock Expansion Project Status.  Please go in an update the spreadsheet for your activity.  Don't forget to save the document.  

Audrey, would you please book a time with Steve and our team on Friday to discuss the status of Red Rock. 

Thanks, Kim.
