Amoco - Amoco has changed its name to BP Energy.  Two deals with BP Energy 
were closed late last Friday:

Southwest Gas - Marketing and Market Services met with reps from SWG to 
discuss finalizing an OBA (we will use the currently effective OBA rather 
than the 637 filed OBA), nominations, scheduling and capacity release.  This 
is in preparation for their new firm transport agreement beginning November 1.

El Paso Field Services -  We have finalized the terms with EPFS for a new 
receipt point in Eddy County, NM.  EPFS will pay $190,000 towards the total 
cost of the interconnect of $330,000 (these figures include tax gross-up).  
TW will construct, own, operate and maintain the new interconnect which will 
tie into the high pressure line of the West Texas lateral.  The estimated 
in-service date is Jan. 1, 2001.  EPFS has committed to flow incremental 
supplies of 12,500 MMBtu/d for a 2 year commitment through the new point.

El Paso Blanco Mis-Measurement - EP made some minor adjustments to the 
language in our settlement letter; final versions were sent out for 
execution.  They have already begun delivering the gas back to TW at Window 
Rock.  If the flow remains high, the payback may be complete before EP goes 
down for maintenance at the end of October otherwise we will complete the 
transaction in early November.   We sold 15,000 MMBtu/d of the volume for 
October to USGT/Aquila at $5.20/MMBtu.

Park 'n Ride - The new automated allocation procedures were implemented this 
week so customers can automatically nominate volume and the system will 
handle any necessary allocations.
