Mojave/Topock
I have two months with different measured volumes than you have. Please fax
the Daily Volume Statement for Meter ID: 0009214-01, Meter Name: TW/Mojave
Topok I/C (DEL), DRN: 000068288 for October 2000 and July 1999.  My fax
number is 719-520-4810.

CIG/Tumbleweed
I have looked back through October 1995. 
Measured Volume Difference. 
Jul-01  CIG = 65 dth TW = 0
Mar-00  CIG = 25 dth TW = 0
CIG is the custody transfer meter. Do you need meter statements to correct
your records?

Jul-00  CIG = 839,636   TW = 839,638 Difference = (2)
Apr-00  CIG = 163,162   TW= 163,134 Difference = 28 
Oct-98  CIG = 84,505   TW = 85,107 Difference = 602
Aug-98  CIG = 326,831   TW = 326,397 Difference = 434
Jul-98  CIG = 212,226   TW = 202,228 Difference = 9,998
May-97  CIG = 86,770   TW = 99,972 Difference = (13,202)

Jan-96  CIG = 59,790   TW = 62,000 Difference = (2,210)

Could you re-check your scheduled volumes?
