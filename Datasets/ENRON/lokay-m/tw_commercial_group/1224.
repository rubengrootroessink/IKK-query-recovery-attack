Here is a revised version of the Red Rock agreement which includes changes suggested by Jeff.  If you've already sent the previous version to shippers, that is perfectly fine, as Jeff's changes should be noncontroversial.  We've just removed the reference to the service request as service requests will be submitted along with each shipper's bid rather than executed simultaneously with the agreement.  This new version more accurately reflects the contracting process for this expansion.
