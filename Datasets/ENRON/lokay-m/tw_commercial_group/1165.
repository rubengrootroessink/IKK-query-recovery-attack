Capacity Marketing - Conoco was awarded the 20,000 MMBtu/d of capacity from San Juan to Needles at max rates for five years and one month beginning 3/1/02.  Demand charges for the term total $14mm.  

Despite the ongoing system maintenance that began this week, gas control has steadily been able to increase TW's west flow from the projected 800,000 MMBtu/d to 900,000 by week's end.  We have also been able to schedule IT deliveries at max rates from Topock to Needles.  This slight increase will help us make up for the greater decrease in volume due to DOT mandated reduced operating pressures when the safety dig-outs commence in early May.  For the period May 8-12, our projected flow of 800,000 MMBtu/d to the border will be reduced to 705,000.

Atoka Lateral Test - We have been working with Agave Petroleum to reconfigure some gas flow as it moves through the Atoka 3 station on the lateral.  Agave is moving approximately 15,000 MMBtu/d of its high pressure gas onto the LEC 10" lateral from the Atoka low pressure line.  The TW Artesia Team moved one A3 compressor from Atoka to the LEC line.  The first test day was Thursday 4/5; the test will run for one week.  If the test works to everyone's satisfaction, we will need to install an additional H2s monitor at A3.  The net benefit to TW of the test will likely be minimal but may allow Agave to better utilize its compression and plant resources around the Atoka system.

ONEOK Westar - We have been working with ONEOK to enable them to make the existing Ward County, TX delivery point a high-volume bi-directional point.  They have installed approximately 1500' of pipe from their Red River system over to the south end (below WT-2) of TW's West Texas lateral.  The ultrasonic meter will be capable of flowing 200,000 MMBtu/d into TW's high pressure line.  ONEOK expects to flow on average 80,000 MMBtu/d.  This volume, by displacement, should free up some WT-2 and WT-1 compressor capacity for gas flowing to Texas intrastate lines; in-service date is expected to be June 1, 2001.
