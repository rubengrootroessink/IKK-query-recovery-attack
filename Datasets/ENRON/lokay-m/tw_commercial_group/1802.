Red Rock is moving along...I wish I could send you the internal pictures of all the construction, they are incredible.  I want to propose a trip to one of the Compressor Stations for all our Red Rock shippers!!!

Your two expansion contract charges are as follows:
#27641, transport rate of .38 plus 5% fuel
#27649, transport rate of .225 plus 5% fuel

The transport rate is combined reservation and commodity, inclusive of all applicable surcharges.  There are no additional charges like ACA, GRI, etc.  Your fuel is a fixed 5%, paid in-kind.

Hope this help!  Talk soon.

Just checking in to see how the Red Rock expasion was going and to see if you 
could provide me with a breakdown of how our Demand and Variable charges will 
look like.  No rush. Thanks!
