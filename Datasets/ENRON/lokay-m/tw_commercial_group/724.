Delete prior Check-list,  The location was ERRONEOUS.

Perry - Attached is the checklist and project summary for a potential POGO 
well connect to Transwestern in Lea County.  POGO has already spudded the 
well and expects a 45 day drill and completion time.  Early estimates for 
well completion is set for early/ mid February 2001.  TW field personnel have 
already met with POGO field personnel to determine the tie-in location for 
this well.  Even though there is an existing flange at the EOG/Pronghorn 
location, which is in close proximity to the POGO well location, another 
location was selected which also does appear to have an existing flange.  
Initial production of this well may be similar to the 30+ MMBtu/day initial 
production of the EOG well.

Please let me know when we can discuss this project, or if I need to provide 
you any additional information at this time.  Christine.
