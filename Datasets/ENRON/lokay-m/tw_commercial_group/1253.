Sorry, Michelle.  I was hoping to get you at least some type of bid,  but Tenaska is very closely reviewing where our investment dollars are going  right now with everyone's credit being looked as so closely and with various  storage and other projects that are currently requiring investment  dollars.  With that review, it was decided by our management since we are  not as well established in California as other areas, it would be best not to  send in any  bid at this time.   If you have other opportunities,  please let me know.  I want to continue to build our presence on TW as the  situations allow.  Thanks for your help.
