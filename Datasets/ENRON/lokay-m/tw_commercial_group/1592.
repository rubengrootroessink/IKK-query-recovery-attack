Pacific Gas & Electric has sent an expression of interest to purchase pipeline capacity from Topock to Calpine South Point.  They are interested in 50,000 MMBtu/d at .05 for approximately 2 years.  The timing is from when they receive FERC approval (late 2002) until their Section 4 restructuring starts (late 2004).
