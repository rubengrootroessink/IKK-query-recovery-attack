Capacity Marketing - Gas control has determined based on current line pack, 
temperature, and flows, that TW could deliver another 10,000 MMBtu/d on a 
Daily Firm basis to the California Border.  This would put February 
seasonally adjusted capacity at 1,135,000 MMBtu/d.  Marketing has sold the 
extra capacity for  February 2 - 28 to Richardson Products based on daily 
index price differentials from Permian to Cal Border.

In addition, bids are due from prospective shippers on Friday February 2 for 
the 400,000 MMBtu/d block of east to east capacity with alternate rights to 
the California border.  The alternate west pricing is based on a sharing of 
the index differential.

TransColorado - TW has been informed by TransColorado (TC) that we have been 
approved to bid on the outsourcing proposal being requested by TC.  Bids are 
due February 16.

Enron OnLine - TW began marketing small blocks of east to east capacity 
packages on EOL effective February 1.
