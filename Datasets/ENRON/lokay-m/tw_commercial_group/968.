Can you check with Lindy to see what the capacity was at in the plan for next year? When does the capacity become available?

The spreads don't support it, but I believe we have Amoco and Aquila bidding max rate for the 12 posted months.  Merit's (Southern) bid was lower in rate and but 10 times the term.  Hmmm...NPV?!?!

Michelle, what did we think we would get for this? Max? What was the term of the capacity that was posted?
