I understand this Level  A is approved for work order generation.  This is the cost from FP for a recyle line and coolers at P-2 to handle NNG Gray flows to Station # 9.  The NNG Gray is a 200 mmcfd bidirectional interconnect with TW.  The min. to run P-2 is 125 mmcfd, the recycle would allow for those less than 100 mmcfd flow requirements from NNG.

James, can you give me a reality check on my numbers, the estimate is stored on N: under P-2 Coolers and recycle line.  Charge your time to the Marketing lump sum work order.   Thanks
