Fuel and variable amounts to roughly $.31. Therefore, our revised numbers should be $1.52 for April - October and $1.74 for April - January.

Sorry for the confusion!

I realize we never talked about how the bids were stated - ours was inclusive of fuel and all variable charges. This will make a big difference in the ultimate rate to your shipper. Do you need me to break this out?
