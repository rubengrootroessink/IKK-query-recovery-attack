Michelle:  Thanks for sending this to me so quickly.  I do have a couple more questions for you.

1.  What is the discount rate you will be using to calculate the NPV in your open season?

2.  Can an affiliate of a company also place a bid for up to the volume available to Needles?

3.  How does the right of first refusal work?

For example, when we spoke earlier I think you used an example of a $3.00 bid for 1 year getting equal value as a $.30 bid for 10 years (adjusted for NPV, of course) and the winning party got a ROFR. (Let's say the 1 year bid won).  At the end of the year, is the ROFR calculated on the $3.00 value the shipper holds the transport at or is it based on current market conditions.  Let's say the market value has collapsed and the market views this capacity as worth only $.28/Dth and the current shipper is willing to match that rate does that mean he can retain the capacity?  Then for what term, whatever the market bids that piece for or will there be a set time the (in years) that the  holder of the capacity will have to match regardless of what the bidder bids?

I hope this example makes sense.  If not, please give me a call to discuss at (303) 252-6224.


Thanks for your help.

Awarding Capacity

1.  Written offers must include material terms (rate, term, points,
quantity).  Shipper should indicate whether it will accept partial
volume in the event allocation is necessary.

2.  Shippers' binding bids must be accompanied by a valid Request for
Gas Transportation Service form.

3.  Shippers submitting bids containing terms or conditions unacceptable
to Transwestern shall not be accepted.

4.  If the total volume of all bids received by Transwestern exceeds the
capacity of the proposed expansion, Transwestern will award the capacity
based on the highest net present value bid (calculated consistent with
the net present value provisions of Transwestern's tariff).

5.  In the event of a tie, the capacity shall be awarded on a pro rata
basis.

6.  Transwestern reserves the right to reject any bid less than the
maximum tariff rate, or any bid that would cause the Red Rock Expansion
to be uneconomic.
