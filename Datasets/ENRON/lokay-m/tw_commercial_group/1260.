There must be something I have missed. The work order was submitted to Marketing for approvals and is in SAP but has not been released to date. The middle of February in-service date mentioned below is out of the question. I have not received word that pogo has given the go ahead for design or materials. We are doing the design (e-mail of 1-8-01) in preparation that they will want the interconnect. 
Please bring me up to date if there have been changes since the first week of January and if the scope of the project has changes since the cost estimate and materials requirements were submitted in early January. 

Thanks
Earl Chanley

Our goal this year for UAF is set at .04. We'll need all this equipment in order to monitor this facility. Thanks for everyone's help.
Thanks
Rich

Michelle,
In speaking with Laura Kunkle yesterday I learned that the land owner notification was sent on 1-08-01 and should be back by about 2-7-01.  Also the Environmental matrix is in the hands of Butch Russell in Albuquerque, so should be ready this week.  The electrical drawings are being done by Frances Balderas in Omaha and be ready by this weeks end. 
My understanding is that Pogo will build the facility per our spec's and we will operate it.  They won't purchase materials until their well comes in.  Pogo anticipates the well should be completed in about a week and a half.
Just to recap, we will need a chromatograph, sulphur monitor, water monitor, flow control, positive shut-in and a means of overpressure protection.  The chromatograph will require commercial electricity.  Operation of the facility without the above will have to be approved by Rich Jolly.
George Kneisley, do you have any input not mentioned above?
In speaking with you yesterday, I think all of these are covered, but just want to make sure.
Thanks,  Arnie

Rich,
The POGO well isn't completed yet.  They expect to be down within three weeks.  This well is adjacent to the big EOG well that came into our system a couple of months ago and is in the same formation.  The EOG gas is still good gas so far.  Hopefully POGO's gas will be the same.
Thanks,  Arnie

Mike this is in your court now. Can it be installed by the middle of February? Arnie has anyone seen  a gas analysis on this?
Thanks

According to John Havard with Pogo, we are to continue on.  With the work order approved, I was told the landowner's notification had already begun.  Pogo is buying the required equipment (including chromotograph, monitors, etc.), per our specifications.  They will own the equipment, but we will operate.  Let me know if you guys have additional information...is this still possible by the middle of February?  Thanks.

Thanks Arnie. Even if Pogo owns the meter station we want to operate it including the flow control.This is one of the ways we're keeping our UAF down. If I can help let me know. We do need to discuss who will operate the facilities asap.

Subject:	Pogo Interconnect

Michelle,

I was wondering where we stand now on the Pogo interconnect South of WT-1 on the West Texas Lateral.  Per our phone conversation a few days ago it sounded like the 30 day landowner notification would be the biggest hold up.  What will be the design capacity for the interconnect?  I think you told me, but I can't find it in my notes.  My understanding is that there will be a chromatograph, sulfur monitor, water monitor, flow control and a way to shut in if pressure reaches our MAOP.  Also, who will own and operate the station?  Let me know if I'm off base on any of this or what I've missed and also don't hesitate to call if you need anything.  Please let us know as things progress.

Thanks,  Arnie
