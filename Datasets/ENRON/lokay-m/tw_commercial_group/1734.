Sold 5,000 MMbtu/d of firm transport to Western Gas Resources from Permian to Topock at .095 plus fuel, generating over $101,000 for the 7 summer months of April through October.
Agreement reached between ENA and TW for capacity for February.  Transwestern, as agent for ENA, released a package of 25,000 MMbtu/day from Ignacio to Blanco to Burlington.  The new contracted max rate of .1020 is .0420 higher than the original rate and will be split 50/50 with ENA.  This will net TW an incremental $14,700, in addition to regaining the original $42,000.
New OBA, containing cash out provision, with Mojave is executed.
