Earl,
I am very happy that you are now settled in Roswell, but Planning would still like to know the status of TW/ Oneok project on West Texas Lateral.
Please update us as soon as you can. Marketing expects to receive the associated cost of this project and that is a reimbursable deal.
Regards,
Mansoor

According to Earl yesterday, Laura Kunkel is meeting with Robert Baker at the field location on Fri 6/8 to review final scope of equipment needed.  When she returns with the data, Earl is to get me a firm cost estimate.  Pls let me know if you hear of anything different.
thanks
