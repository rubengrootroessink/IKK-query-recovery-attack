 I have checked the location of the Wizard#1 well. According to the legal description, the well is located approximately 6 miles north of WT-1.
 I have listened to Mike's phone message and he mentioned that the field is located near the existing TW/ Conoco Turkey Track interconnect, unfortunately our map does not show it. The  Turkey Track is located 13 .5 miles north of WT-1 or 6 miles north of the Wizard#1. If they are interested, we might have to build a new tap for them. Please let me know  if you want us to develop a scope/ costs for this project.

Mansoor, please handle this request.  I have forwarded you a voice message also that I believe is pertaining to this project.  Michelle is out of the office but will be returning on Monday, 5/21.  Let me know if I may be of further assistance.  EF x33395

I have been speaking to Mike Bauschbach (915-686-7709) who is a consultant representing a producer located close to our West Texas lateral.  The field is called Wizard #1, Eddy County, 19 South 30 East Section 1.  There is a potential of 20,000/day.   I have giving them a Level A (30%) from a recent project as an estimate for economics.  Can you verify the location (north of WT-1)?  Is there an existing tap close by?  

This could be a terrific opportunity for incremental supply, past our compressor bottleneck.
