Operations is digging out 2000 feet of pipe to begin the hydro test today or 
thursday.  If the test results are good, they'll recoat the pipe and put it 
back in service.  We could be at 80% volume on Friday afternoon, but this is 
tentative.  

Also, the smart pig test run several months ago identified 4 potential areas 
that need inspections west of station 5.  While east of thoreau is down, 
these 4 areas will also be inspected.

Do not pass this info onto customers at this point till we have further 
information.  We will make a posting hopefully this afternoon.  Operations is 
also trying to combine some additional compressor work to this outage (i.e. 
grouting another unit and replacing some valves).  This work will limit our 
west deliveries to 875,000.  This notice will also be posted shortly.

see me if you have questions
