Would you please let Jan, Palu or myself know what contracts would fall within this category.  If you are unable to print Vernon's list, we have one that you can make a copy of.  Please note Vernon's due date of Friday, June 15!!!!

The attached is a report from the Zai*Net system showing any physical contracts we have that contain embedded derivatives.  Just to be sure that the system is 100% complete, I am asking that you compare the attached list with your records.  If you have any Index related transport or fuel deals that are not on the list, please provide me with the contract number, start & end date, volume, Index(es), deilvery (and receipt) point, counterparty name, and any adjustment to the index value.  I am only looking for contracts that were effective on or after 1/31/2001.   Please let me know by Friday, June 15.

Thanks!
