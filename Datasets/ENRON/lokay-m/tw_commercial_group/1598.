While the Transwestern Commercial group does not actively use these systems, I am not sure we want to delete them.  Can we save these on another server versus recreating them from scratch in the future?  Ben Asante has been providing support for us.

These 2 links are currently on the Dashboard and were supplied by Michelle Lokay to be presented in the TW Transportation category. The home.ets.enron.com web server is scheduled to be shutdown today at 5 p.m. Have/will these items be relocated? If so, please notify me of the new URL, otherwise I will have to remove these links from the Dashboard.

Thanks,
