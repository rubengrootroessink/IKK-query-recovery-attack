When we were talking with Steve and Michelle this morning I had forgottent that the Reliant mechanism is the Permian index minus SJ index minus $.10 times 50%.  That makes a big difference.  Please send me the whatever you have (I think Michelle had a spreadsheet this morning) showing the gross basis and the actual rate paid under the Reliant deal.  Also, if you know it what does forward basis for May look like on that deal?  FERC hasn't asked for this stuff yet, but they may and I'd like to start thinking about how we get this docket closed down.  Yesterday's order doesn't make the situation worse, obviously, but it also doesn't give any indication of this thing going away anytime soon either.  Please label anything you send me on this subject "Attorney Client Privileged."  Thanks. df
