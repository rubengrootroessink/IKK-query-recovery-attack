I understand that EOG transferred the funds yesterday, 8-13-01, for the
material for the EOG Pronghorn interconnect.  This memo is so that we are
all on the same page.

Re:  Building - I called Abbott Building Company yesterday and told them
that Enron is releasing the building to EOG.  I talked with Mike Abbott
about when they could deliver the building and he said, "We can deliver it
in the morning if you want."  So, I gave him the phone numbers for Dirk
Ellyson to get directions and further instructions.

Re:  Equipment for inside the building - I talked with Don Pitts yesterday,
as well as, Mel Mayes and Ernie De Los Santos.  I told Don we could deliver
the material to his office or to the site and he said they really weren't
ready for it quite yet.  Mel Mayes, who will be doing the wiring and
electrical work for EOGResources, agreed that he didn't want to have to work
around all the equipment laying in the building.  So, Ernie, of the CDC
group in Roswell, has agreed to deliver the equipment to the site when EOG
is ready for it, which should be sometime next week.
