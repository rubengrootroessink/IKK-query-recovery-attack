FYI...Burlington will "probably" send an amendment request tomorrow for April through October delivery changes.  The contract of 80,000/day will be split as follows:
26,000/day at Oasis for all 7 months
30, 000/day at ANR Red Deer for all 7 months
24,000/day at WNG Canadian River for April-May, 24,000/day at PEPL Hansford for June-Oct

Perry, you'd checked this capacity for me Monday.  Is it still available?
