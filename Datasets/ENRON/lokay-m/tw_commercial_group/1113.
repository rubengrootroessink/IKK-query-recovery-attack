Michelle:

Per our Transwestern transportation agreement, North Start Steel would
line to change our delivery point from PG&E Topock - (POI 56698) on the
Transwestern Pipeline to CPN South Point (POI 78113) for 1,300 mmbtu
per day deliveries on or about May 7, 2001 or sooner or later, as
soonest this point becomes operational. This change will remain in
effect through May 31, 2002 gas day, which is the duration of the
transportation contract.


Sincerely,
Corny Boersma
