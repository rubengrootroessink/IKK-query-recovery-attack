This email will serve as documentation for removing the Right of First Refusal indicator from Oneok's contract #27340.  The contract has gone through the ROFR process but was not awarded.  When this indicator is lifted, 20000 should appear on Transwestern's bulletin board...10000 to Needles and 10000 to Topock.  Thanks.
