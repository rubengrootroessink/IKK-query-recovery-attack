Southwest Gas - SWG informed us this week they will most likely not be ready 
to receive gas from TW by the projected November 1 in-service date; the new 
date will probably be mid-month.  We will still invoice SWG for 
transportation under their firm contract beginning Nov. 1.  Also, upon 
inspection this week, TW engineering noticed SWG had installed a bypass-valve 
on their meter station at the new facility.  This bypass was not in the 
originally approved drawings.  TW's policy does not allow for a bypass unless 
the customer has a non-interruptible contract.  We are waiting for an 
explanation from SWG and will likely ask them to remove the extra pipe.

Transport Options Program - A meeting to brief FERC Staff about the program 
was held in Washington this week.  Overall, the filing received a very 
positive response.  Staff indicated the program would assist them with their 
directive to respond to the SouthWest power crunch.  Issues to address in the 
filing will be ways to mitigate potential affiliate abuse, capacity hoarding, 
and provide specific examples of the types of options.   We are still on 
track to make the FERC filing the week of October 9.

Agave Energy - Has agreed to purchase an additional 10,000 MMBtu/d firm on 
the Atoka lateral beginning 3/1/01.  The contract is a one-part rate of 
$.05/MMBtu for one year for deliveries east of Thoreau.
