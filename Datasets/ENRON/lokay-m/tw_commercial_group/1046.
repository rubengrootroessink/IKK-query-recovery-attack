This is to respond to your question on TW/ Conoco at W-1. If Conoco has a line close to WT-1 or they are able to tie to WT-1, I would recommend that they should tie their line to discharge side of the WT-1 Compressor Station and not to the suction. A similar case was recommended to Duke a couple of months ago. The line pressure at discharge side of WT- 1 is 1008 psig.
