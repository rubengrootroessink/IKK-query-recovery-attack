Hi Lorraine,

Next week I'm heading west to meet with Mohave Electric Co-op and EWS West Desk regarding this project.  I know we've spoken about it before, but I was hoping to have some time with you this afternoon to get you up to speed on our progress and get your input on the attached presentation.  Could I come by at 3:00pm?  Please advise.


Thanks,
John
