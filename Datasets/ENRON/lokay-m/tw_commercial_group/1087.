Pursuant to our meeting, I was to check the posting timelines to see if we =
could make the 1 day category, include 5 months or less rather than less th=
an 5 months.  Based on a recent decision (March 16, 2001) in Columbia Gas T=
ransmission Co,  I think we can.  In Columbia, the Commission approved Colu=
mbia's proposal to establish an interactive auction process in which firm c=
apacity available for less than one year would be posted for an initial one=
 hour period from 7:00 am to 8:00 a.m.   Capacity offered for one year or m=
ore would be subject to an initial posting period of  5 days.     This indi=
cates movement by the Commission to much shorter posting periods for capaci=
ty available for less than one year.  I think we can modify our procedures =
to include up to 5 months in the 1 day posting category.  However, we may w=
ant to consider combining the 3 day category and 1 day category into one 1 =
day category for capacity offered for less than one year.    In addition, f=
or capacity offered for one year or more, Columbia will advertise a propose=
d offer on its EBB one day prior to the five-day posting of the capacity.  =
(This supports a special posting in advance.)   Although it is good to have=
 these internal procedures, what is important to the Commission is that pip=
eline tariffs set forth specific procedures regarding the availability of c=
apacity. =20

The Columbia order also gave guidance on when a pipeline has to accept a bi=
d for max rates.     Columbia proposed that it not be required to sell capa=
city to shippers bidding the maximum rate for a term of less than 12 months=
 until one day prior to the commencement of gas flow detailed in the auctio=
n package.  The Commission rejected this in favor of the Industrials' propo=
sal:  Beginning 30 days before the capacity is available for service, Colum=
bia must accept bids at the max rate for a term of five months to less than=
 12 months.  Beginning seven days before the capacity is available, Columbi=
a must accept maximum rate bids for terms of more than one month to less th=
a 5 months.  Columbia must accept maximum rate bids for a term of one month=
 or less one day before gas flows. =20

Thanks, Maria

Attached for your review is a redlined draft of TW's Capacity Posting Proce=
dure including changes suggested at our meeting yesterday.  One remaining i=
tem is to decide whether capacity available for "less than 5 months" or "5 =
months or less" will be designated as 1 day postings.  Please review and ad=
vise if you have any additional comments.  Thanks.
