Michelle,

Sorry for the delay in getting this to you.  The following is a partial list
of items that Williams would like to discuss in our meeting on Wednesday
November 14th at 9:30 a.m.  Other questions will probably surface as we move
through our discussion.

I would like to start with an overview of the OBA and why the change.  And
as we go through the new OBA these questions can be addressed as we get to
the appropriate section.  Does that work for you?  

1.  Methodology of clearing the ending imbalance as of November 30th. How
does WFS  pay back the "old" imbalance while also delivering volumes on the
"new" OBA?

2.  How will payback be scheduled when your line runs full all of the time? 

3.  We currently net all of the points in the San Juan area.  Will this
still be the case? 

4.  How do we handle situations that have occurred multiple times this week
where TRW has lost compression.  If this occurs after Intraday 2, how do we
makeup during the rest of the month if you cannot accept payback?

5.  When an under delivery occurs, who determines the responsible party and
how will the associated volume be excluded from penalty when caused by
Transwestern?

6.  What happens when Transwestern accepts Intraday 2 nom increases but
cannot accept the physical flow needed to rate out the day?

7.  How do you propose we track separate volumes / imbalances depending on
who caused the shortfall?

Please call if my questions need clarification.

Thanks
