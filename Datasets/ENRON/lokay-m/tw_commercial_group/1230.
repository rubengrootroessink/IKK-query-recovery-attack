Yesterday the Commission issued a draft order on Transwestern's request for rehearing in Docket No. RP00-249.  We had asked the the Commission remove the restriction on the months in which TW can acquire capacity on PNM.  The order reads, in pertinent part:

	At the present time, firm capacity is not available on PNM's system during peak periods, since all firm capacity on PNM's system is subject to recall by PNM in order to maintain service to core customers.  If in the future, however, circumstances change and Transwestern is able to acquire firm capacity on the PNM system which is not subject to recall or other prior commitment, Transwestern can do so.  Transwestern will be required to file a revised tariff sheet to reflect thte determinations made in this order before it can acquire such furm capacity during the peak period.

If you have any questions, let me know.
