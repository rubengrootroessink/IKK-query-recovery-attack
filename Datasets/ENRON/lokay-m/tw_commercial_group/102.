Please note the following request by Richardson to suspend another month of 
their contract for the month of August.  We will have to account for this 
contract suspension in the August forecast with an estimated loss of  
$116,203. 500  (35,700 MM/d * 31 days* $.105)

Dennis -   Our records indicate that the new terminate date should be 
4/31/02.  Let's discuss if you need some documentation to make the system 
reflect this termination date.  CS 

Perry - Please verify if your capacity sheets reflect this 4/31/02 terminate 
date as well.  Thanks.
