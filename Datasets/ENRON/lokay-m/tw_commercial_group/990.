I just spoke with Mark Kraus from EOG.  He has received the SAP spreadsheet itemizing the materials and is reviewing the information with the folks from his field.  When the review is complete, a wire transfer of funds will be sent to Transwestern.  Because Mark had been expecting another invoice with the revised amount, he now anticipates this review to take several days.  Once the funds are received, the equipment will then be shipped.

Mark mentioned that he thought they were installing all the equipment themselves and would not need our services.  What additional charges could there be?

Michelle

The material for the I/C is ready to ship to EOG. Do we go ahead and send the material or hold till they pay? The material is in the Roswell CDC and will remain there with the exception of the building, till we receive your response.

EC,  I got a call from Mike Abbott today and the building is ready to go.
Do you know if Michelle has an agreement made or any $ for this material.
Or, should we have this shipped to them on a "good faith" basis.
	In the previous attached memo, I told EOG that I would let them know
when the building is ready, so I owe them a call as soon as I find out how
Enron wants me to handle the material.  If you want me to call Michelle
directly, I can do that, too, just let me know.  Thanks and have a great
weekend!
