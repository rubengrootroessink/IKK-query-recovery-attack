Here is how I see the February release, with the 50/50 sharing mechanism:

ENA's contract with TW is at a daily rate of $0.0600 (one-part)
The release to Burlington is at a daily rate of $0.1020 (demand only plus applicable commodity and fuel based on usage)
TW will bill Burlington through normal course of business (reservation of $71,400 [$0.1020 x 25,000 x 28 days] plus applicable commodity fees)
ENA demand invoice will be adjusted for a capacity release credit of $56,700  [($0.1020 - $0.021) x 25,000 x 28 days]
TW will need to book marketing fee revenues of $14,700 [$0.021 x 25,000 x 28 days]
ENA will be looking for a payment of $14,700 for their portion of the shared upside


I'd copied your format for January...what do you think of the February numbers?
