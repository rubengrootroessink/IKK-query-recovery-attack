	Michelle:

	It was great to finally talk with you.  Here is some information on
the new power plants planned in the Bakersfield area.  This file is a couple
of years old and I quickly added in some of the latest information but some
of the information here is still quite outdated.  However, this document has
some rough diagrams of the area so you can see where the projects are
located.  The California Energy Commission has some information on their web
site about these projects as well.

	I'll talk to you soon.

	Ben Campbell
