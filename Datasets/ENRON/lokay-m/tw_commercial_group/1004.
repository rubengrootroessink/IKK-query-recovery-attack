Thanks, EC!  FYI - The last four items, starting with the Bristol, the two
transmitters and the sensors should be taken off this list to EOG since
these went to WT-1.  This will reduce the cost by $7698.

The cost for material ordered for this work order is $94,126.27.
the attached spread sheet is from the SAP accounting system and invoices
will be routed to Marketing to forward to EOG for the supporting
documentation to this spreadsheet. 
If you have any Questions,. please contact me.
