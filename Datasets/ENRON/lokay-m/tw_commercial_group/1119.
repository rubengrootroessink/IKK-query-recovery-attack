Contract Request Forms:

Requests for new service will go to Marketing.

Marketing will verify accuracy of request form to ensure that the following minimum requirements are met:
	Shipper Name
	Shipper Address
	Phone Number
	Fax Number
	State of Incorporation
	Type of Service (IT, FT, etc.)
	Quantity
	Contract Term (Beginning and end dates)
	Receipt Point(s) name
	Delivery Point(s) name

Amendments
?	Marketing will re-visit with Legal the issues regarding "stacked" amendments and capacity.
?	In order to facilitate changes in the system, Contract Administration will suspend using the amendment number on all amendment letters. (until the new contract system is in place).
?	Dennis and Michelle C. will look at internal procedures for amendments and modify as needed to facilitate process.

CAS
Dennis will work with Perry Frazier and Linda Trevino to develop a plan for CAS approval when Perry is not available.

Transactional Reporting

Marketing will provide a deal sheet on any new contract or amendment that is not at max rate so that contact administration can accurately produce the required transactional report.
Minimum information required on the deal sheet:
?	Contract Number (if known)
?	Rates (if one-part, need break down of Demand and Commodity.  (Rule of thumb is that commodity will be min rate and remainder will be demand.)
?	Alternate point information (if applicable)
?	Glossary of Terms (i.e. R01, R03, T01)
?	Dennis will provide updated Glossary of Terms

Tracking
?	Marketing will discuss tracking of contract from request through returned signed contract.
?	Contract administration has an internal form for individual contracts but does not track on a spreadsheet.

Contract Copies
?	Marketing will discuss whether copies are required.  
?	Josue will not make copies of entire contracts. 
?	On-line contract viewing capabilities through Envision are expected in the future.

Next Meeting
April 30 	EB 4103 @ 3:00
