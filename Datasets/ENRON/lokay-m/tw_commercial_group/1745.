Approved.

This will complete the PP&L Red Rock expansion contract.  I think we are on amendment #4.  They will now have all 20,000 MMBtu/day for all of their 30 years and 1 month term from the West Texas pool.

Subject: West Texas Receipt Capacity


Michelle,

As we discussed please forward a new ammendment to our existing Red Rock 
Agreement that will move 2000/dth/day of primary receipt point capacity from 
East of Thoreau to the West Texas Pool for the period November 1, 2002 until 
February 28, 2003. If you have any questions, please feel free to give me a 
call.

Best Regards
David Smith
