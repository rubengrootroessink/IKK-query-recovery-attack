Jerry and Arnold,

Here are our comments on the letter to Nuovo Pignone.  Please don't hesitate to call me if you need additional information or have any questions.  Thank you for all of the support that you have provided us on this project. 

Arnold, do you usually have someone from legal review these type of letters?  We would be happy to help you do this, if you like.  Just let me know.  

Thanks, 
Kim.

Please find attached a draft letter from us to Nuovo Pignone regarding the partial commitment (3 of 4 units) on the Red Rock project.  They had indicated that 13 June was the absolute last day we could respond, so the letter will be dated as such.

Your comments are solicited by the close of business tomorrow.  Kim, I assume you will review and comment for Steve Harris.

Thanks,
Jerry
