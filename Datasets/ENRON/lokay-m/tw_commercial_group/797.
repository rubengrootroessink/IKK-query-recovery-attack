Subject: Toy Closet

Okay, it's done!!!!  :)    :)

All of our gifts have been neatly, and I emphasize, NEATLY, arranged in our 
toy closet.  I have attached a logout sheet for your review only.  I have a 
sample sign off in red.  

I would like for everyone to sign off on each item you take and leave the 
remaining number for the next person to quickly access the gifts.

I expect all of you to keep our closet CLEAN and CLUTTER FREE :)

If you take the last item, let me know.  If you feel we should order more 
gifts, see Kevin :)

Should you have any additional questions, please see me.  

By the way, you all are familiar with where I keep the keys in the event I'm 
not available.

Thanks for your attention and cooperation.

You all are soooo great!!!!
