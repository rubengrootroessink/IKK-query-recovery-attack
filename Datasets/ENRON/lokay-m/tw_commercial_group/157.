Here is an update:

Red Cedar - still need Mary Kay's signature prior to my sending to Dan 
McCarty.  Mary Kay's secretary indicated yesterday that she will be back in 
the office today.  Base transportation contract is ready to go.

Sempra - reminded Drew Fossum 2nd time this morning to approve. I still do 
not have the request for the tranportation contract from Sempra for the Jan 
1, 2001 - Dec. 31, 2001 Ignacio to Blanco deal!  We need this immediately.  I 
already have Dan McCarty's approval.

Texaco - Same as for Sempra - reminded Drew again this morning we need 
approval.  Still do not have the request form for transportation contract! I 
already have Dan McCarty's approval.

Sempra - November 2000 - October 31, 2001 deal.   Jeff indicated Stephanie 
will be in the office next Tuesday, September 5th and will sign the deal.  
This deal has been outstanding to Sempra for over 30 days.

Oneok -  Tendered by Michelle this Wednesday.  No returned contract to date.
