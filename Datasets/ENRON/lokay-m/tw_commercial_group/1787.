Approved.  Please generate amendment for Western's Redrock expansion contract #27608, effective 06/01/2002.  This amendment will now change their 10,000 MMBtu/day contract to have all receipts in the West Texas Pool #58646.  Effective ending date will be the term of the contract, through 05/31/2017.  Thanks.

Michelle:  This e-mail is to inform you that I would like to adjust my Redrock Receipt point for the total volume of 10,000 MMBtu/d to the Permian West Texas Pooling point consistent with our oral discussion.

Thank you. Terri Dickerson
