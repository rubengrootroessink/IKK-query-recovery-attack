AGI Consulting will be conducting the Team Development Training at the Del Lago Resort and Conference Center on Tuesday, April 3rd and Wednesday, April 4th.  

As stated in your Training Plan Agenda, the program will commence at 8:00am on Tuesday morning and end at 4:45pm on Wednesday afternoon.  A block of rooms has been reserved for Tuesday night only.  Because this site is located on the north side of town, some of you may have difficulty arriving by 8:00a.  This being the fact, Steve has graciously offered to finance accommodations for a Monday night stay as well.  If you would like for me to reserve an extra night for you,  please call me by Monday, March 26.

Driving directions are noted below:

		Take I-45 North, exit Number 87, towards Conroe (TX-105)
		Turn Slight Left onto TX-105
		(Approximately 60 miles from downtown)

If you should have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me.
