Ugh.  Not only does this result stink in this docket, but my paranoid side (about 95% of me) thinks this is an entirely political decision and bodes ill for our overall California situation.  df

Subject:	TW capacity options order

The Commission issued an order today rejecting Transwestern's filing to purchase and sell options for firm transportation capacity.  The Commission found that Transwestern has not met its burden of proof that its proposal will overcome the adverse consequences identified by the parties to this proceeding.  Specifically, the concerns raised by the protestors included:  the reservation of future capacity without a concomitant payment of reservation charges, which precludes other shippers that place a higher value on the capacity from acquiring the capacity; the use of the program for speculative purposes; and the absence of a recourse options rate to provide protection to shippers as required under the Commission's negotiated rate authority.  I'm faxing the order.  I presume we want to seek rehearing?  Maria
