Additional suppliers on Transwestern in the San Juan area are Red Cedars and Williams Field Services.  Our contacts there are Ed Meaders at 970-382-7394 and Charlie Brown at 918-574-9297.  I had mentioned Public Service of New Mexico (PNM) earlier, but their production is usually taken off our system versus delivered into our San Juan area.  Hope this helps!

Hi Beth,
	According to the engineers, minimum pipeline delivery pressure would likely be 750 psi at the Panda interconnect.  Let me know if you have questions.  

talk with you soon.
