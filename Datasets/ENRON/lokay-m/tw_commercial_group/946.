Michelle,

As we discussed, PPL EnergyPlus is interested in transportation service from 
Griffith Energy Delivery to points downstream at the same rates we now receive 
(.2792 + .0022).  This also includes a zero fuel rate.  If you have any 
questions please feel free to give me a call.

Best Regards

David Smith
