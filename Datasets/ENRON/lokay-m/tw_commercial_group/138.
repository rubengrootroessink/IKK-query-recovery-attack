Subject: Bid Week Back-up

Kevin - would you like to join me and Michelle when I go over the contract 
generation process for this next bid week period?  I think you would find it 
interesting in terms of better understanding the range of responsibilities I 
have which are associated with the contract generation, documentation and 
especially discount letter generation.  Also, starting immediately, there 
will be an additional step required for the purposes of 637 posting 
requirements which Michelle will need to be familiar with in addition to 
these other back-up responsibilities.    I will be in a Derivative training 
class next Tuesday and Wednesday, the primary days when a few TK deals will 
be needing to be processed.  I can either meet with you and Michelle this 
Friday or next Monday.  Thanks.
