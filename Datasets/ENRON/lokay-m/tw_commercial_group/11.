According to Jeff Dasovich, the CEO of Sempra has referred to the project 
publicly as a "bypass pipeline."  The pipe will drop down through Imperial 
Irrigation, follow the border on the Mexico side, go through Mexicali and 
serve the new Sempra LDC there, go back across the border to south of San 
Diego to the PG&E's Otay Mesa IPP, then proceed on to Rosarita.

As we discussed, the "genie is out of the bottle" with respect to all future 
bypass projects in California.  The only significant opposition that could be 
mounted here is the CPUC and/or other customer groups like TURN or ORA 
bemoaning the project's "cherrypicking" of gas loads.
