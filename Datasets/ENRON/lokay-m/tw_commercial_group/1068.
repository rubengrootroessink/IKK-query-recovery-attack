Based on our conversations, attached is a worksheet with current basis for
SoCal Needles.  Please view the latest date spreadsheet.

 <<available money for demand fees 05_2001.xls>>

Also as we discussed, the market is currently not showing us basis bids for
PG&E Topock.  Therefore, USGT/Aquila would like you to consider $0.10 per
MMBtu for Transwestern's capacity to PG&E Topock.

Please call me if you have any questions.
