Hello everyone!  As the United Way campaign gets kicked-off this year for 
Enron, I volunteered to be a team leader to help out with the campaign.  The 
big kick-off for Enron is tomorrow, Wednesday, August 9 at 11:15 at the Hyatt 
Regency.  GPG will be participating in a round of Enron's own game show, "Who 
Wants to Help Millions for United Way?".  To show our support for GPG's game 
show contestant and the United Way, Please join Stan Horton and your GPG 
co-workers at 11:00am at the wheelchair ramp on the Andrews side of the Enron 
Building to walk to the Hyatt together.  Dress casual and wear a BLUE shirt 
to represent GPG proudly!

Also, mark your calendar for Monday, August 21 at 3:00pm in the Energizer for 
the GPG rally.

Enron has added an on-line pledging feature to the United Way campaign this 
year.  No more pledge cards to pass around!  I have seen a demo of the system 
and I must say it makes turning in your pledge very easy!  You will learn 
more about this tomorrow!  

Please plan to attend the Enron rally tomorrow!  I am available to provide 
you additional information about United Way or help answer any questions you 
may have about Enron's participation in the campaign so please don't hesitate 
to call me at Ext. 33098.  I look forward to seeing you there!  

Thanks, Kim Watson.
