It's time to kick-off Enron's 2000 United Way Campaign!  This year's theme is 
"Who Wants to Help Millions for the United Way?"  

By now, everyone should have received a trivia questionnaire through email.  
By answering all 15 questions correctly, you will have a chance to be 
selected for an opportunity to be in our United Way game show on August 9 
following the all-employee meeting.  If you are selected, you'll be entering 
in the "fast finger" and give your "final answer" qualifying round.  
Finalists from the qualifying round will be a contestant on the Enron "Who 
Wants to Help Millions?" game show.

The last day you can submit your answers to be eligible for the game show is 
Wednesday, July 26.  Let's make sure that GPG is represented in full force 
during this year's campaign!

Watch your email for additional information about this year's Kick-Off and 
how you can help millions throughout the United Way Campaign.
