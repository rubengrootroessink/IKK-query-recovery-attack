It's the Building Guy!  

Due to popular demand, we have put the latest segments of "The Building Guy" 
on IP-TV.

Click the Start button on your task bar, then click Programs and Business 
Applications.  Next, click IP-TV Viewer to launch the program and 
double-click "The Building Guy" in the program list.  If you've never used 
the IP-TV Viewer, there will be a brief user set-up process.  Don't worry;
