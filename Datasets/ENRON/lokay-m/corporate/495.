I wanted to share some great news with you about a major corporate initiati=
ve=20
within ETS, called the iBuyit project, that you should know about and be=20
looking forward to.  iBuyit is a tool that will make it easier for you to=
=20
purchase the things you need to get your job done and/or to operate our=20
business. Some key points related to iBuyit are:

? Employees at all levels across ETS will be able to access iBuyit on their=
=20
computers much like the Enron Intranet.   iBuyit provides an upgrade to the=
=20
existing B2B Web-Based Procurement tool.
? iBuyit will utilize a new catalog system (REQUISITE) that will make it=20
easier for you to identify material items and incorporate them into the=20
requisition.
? iBuyit will not only make it simple for you to buy on-line, but it can al=
so=20
serve as your single, convenient source to access other tools and informati=
on=20
you use everyday at Enron.

Stan Horton, Rod Hayslett, and Phil Lowry decided back in December that ETS=
=20
would take the lead by being the first business unit to begin working with=
=20
Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS), who is developing iBuyit.  Both field and=
=20
Houston-based ETS employees have been involved with iBuyit efforts to-date =
to=20
help determine how iBuyit can best be used to support our employees and our=
=20
business.  More of you will be involved as the iBuyit project progresses.

iBuyit will be deployed to ETS, Corporate, EBS, EES, and EWS in a phased=20
approach during the first three quarters of 2001.  Starting in April, iBuyi=
t=20
will be available to certain groups of ETS employees for the purchase of=20
office supplies and travel.  iBuyit will be implemented on a full scale=20
across ETS in July.

Those of you in Engineering may be aware of the ongoing MLRP efforts and ma=
y=20
be wondering about the impact of iBuyit.  Because of the unique nature of i=
ts=20
business, Engineering has decided to continue moving forward with MLRP.  Bu=
t,=20
we will also continue to explore ways for iBuyit to complement MLRP and=20
benefit Engineering=01,s business. =20

As the person ultimately responsible for iBuyit=01,s success within ETS, I=
=20
wanted to share my enthusiasm with you as early as possible about iBuyit.  =
In=20
addition to what I already mentioned, iBuyit strongly supports ETS=01,s exi=
sting=20
Procurement and Supply Management strategy, will allow the company to save=
=20
money by taking advantage of its relationships with preferred suppliers, an=
d=20
will help us to achieve a greater return on our investments in cutting-edge=
=20
technology.  As you can tell, there are many strong reasons for all of us=
=20
within ETS to be excited about iBuyit.

So, stay tuned.  You may be asked to actively participate in iBuyit efforts=
,=20
but I guarantee that you will have many opportunities to hear and learn mor=
e=20
about iBuyit in the coming months.  You will also have many opportunities t=
o=20
have your questions answered and opinions heard - starting here.  If you ha=
ve=20
any questions or comments, simply reply to this e-mail - I will appreciate=
=20
hearing from you.
