Join Bill Donovan on eSpeak at ethink.enron.com, Tuesday, June 6 at 10 a.m. 
Houston time.  Bill, vice president of Enron Property Services Operations, 
will conduct an "open mike" session on the new Enron building in Houston.

Are you at a remote location or can't make the event? Go into eSpeak now and 
pre-submit your question(s) for Bill to answer during the scheduled event.  
We want to answer everyone's questions, but due to the high volume of 
questions we anticipate on this session, it would be helpful if you can keep 
your questions short and simple.  This will increase the opportunity for your 
question to be answered.
