You know all those credit card offers you get, offering great introductory 
rates with a balance transfer?  Forget them.  Introduce yourself to the 
ThinkBank instead.

Starting Friday, October 27, you can use "Good Sense" in the ThinkBank to 
find creativity resources, tips and techniques to make your job more 
fulfilling.  There is also a vault full of ideas from your fellow Enron 
employees.

The ThinkBank is committed to keeping your interest rate high.  When was the 
last time a credit card offer told you the truth about that?
