Join Ken Lay on eSpeak at ethink.enron.com, Friday, July 14 at 10 a.m. 
Houston time.  Enron's Chairman and CEO will conduct an "open mike" session 
to answer whatever questions you have for him.

Are you at a remote location or can't make the event? Go into eSpeak now and 
pre-submit your question(s) for Mr. Lay to answer during the scheduled 
event.  We want to answer everyone's questions, but due to the high volume of 
questions we anticipate on this session, it would be helpful if you can keep 
your questions short and simple.  This will increase the opportunity for your 
question to be answered.
