Sorry, Michelle.? I was hoping to get you at least some type of bid,  but 
Tenaska is very closely reviewing where our investment dollars are going  
right now with everyone's credit being looked as so closely and with various  
storage and other projects that are currently requiring investment  dollars.? 
With that review, it was decided by our management since we are  not as well 
established in California as other areas, it would be best not to  send in 
any? bid at this time.?? If you have other opportunities,  please let me 
know.? I want to continue to build our presence on TW as the  situations 
allow.? Thanks for your help.
