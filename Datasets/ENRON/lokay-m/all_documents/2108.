You're doing it again.  Scowling.  Is something bothering you?  Some business 
problem you don't know how to solve?  Why don't you share it with eThink.  
We're declaring a company-wide call for "sticky wickets."  Send your business 
problem to ethink@enron.com.  We'll select a few and publish them in the next 
eThink About It.  Then, your colleagues can post their suggestions in the 
ThinkBank's Idea Vault, in the special categories we create for your issues.



Don't miss experienceENRON on eSpeakTuesday, January 30 at 10:00 am Houston 
time.  Carrie Robert, manager of experienceENRON, will answer your questions 
about how this program can help your business development objectives.



Last week was a busy one for eMeet.  The Office of the Chairman had some 
things to say, and there was also a discussion about  the Black-Scholes value 
of our EnronOptions.  Go to eMeet today and see what you missed last week!
