Omaha Facility Planning Team     (Team Leader: Steve Thomas 402-398-7468)

Earlville Outage
On October 12th starting at 8:00 am the Earlville unit will be taken down f=

October 16th & 17th.  The unit should be back on-line sometime near midnigh=
t=20
on October 12th.

With Earlville down for this time frame the flow on the East leg will be=20
limited to the 660-680 mmcf/d range.  We anticipate that normal nominations=

system flows.

Planning White Paper
Planning met with various Marketing representatives to try and attach a val=
ue=20
to the four ideas put forth in the White Paper.   The ideas were thoroughly=
=20
discussed and the input we received will be incorporated into the Paper.  =
=20
One suggestion was that we use the Pricing Desk to determine the value of t=

additional capacity.  We will be meeting with them to do that.  Meanwhile=

research continues on the various costs associated with the White Paper,=20
specifically sites for proposed inlet pressure additions. =20

Engineering Records Research

Ogden Building #2 Discharge Pressure
Research has been completed in trying to locate documentation that supports=

the 1000 psig MAOP for the building #2 discharge header.  The supporting=20
documentation has been forwarded to Lisa Choquette in Codes for approval.  =

Pengilly TBS - Mesabi System
Marketing was presented with two separate estimates for modification requir=
ed=20
to increase firm at Pengilly from 12 mcf/day to 210 mcf/day.   The first=20
estimate for $85,000 consisted mostly of contract labor with field personne=
l=20
only installing the EFM.  The team responded with a proposal that they woul=
d=20
be willing to do all of the labor if it could be scheduled during Jan-March=
. =20
A second estimate of $66,000 was submitted to Marketing, which included all=
=20
district labor.  This estimate is contingent on completing the deal prior t=
o=20
Dec 31,2000.  If a deal is made after Dec 31, 2000 then the higher cost=20
estimate applies.

Monroe #1 TBS Mods / Pressure Increase
The Monroe #1 TBS Mods Project was released to Engineering.   The project w=
as=20
the result of WIGas raising the IT load by approximately 4000 mcf/day.  The=
y=20
also requested a pressure increase at the station from 80 psig to 275=20
psig.    A Form 2476 "Pressure Increase Request Form" is being circulated f=
or=20
signature.  The project has a targeted Nov 30, 2000 in-service date.  The=

modifications consist of replacing both meters with spool pieces and=20
performing a pressure test to upgrade the MAOP.

Milbank Project
Continued gathering data to model the Milbank system as it is today.

Melbourne #1 - Project Release
The Melbourne #1 TBS Mods project was released to Engineering.   The projec=
t=20
consists of TBS mods to support the increase of firm from 330 mcf/day to 50=
0=20
mcf/day at Melbourne. Presently the Marshalltown B/L is constrained and cou=
ld=20
not support the incremental firm.  Alliant will realign gas away from the=
=20
Marshalltown #1 TBS which is at the end of this B/L to the Marshalltown #1A=

TBS which is on a different B/L.  This will open up capacity on the line fo=
r=20
this new load.   The project has a targeted Nov 30, 2000 in-service date. =
=20
Modifications consist of replacing the first and second cut regulators and=
=20
replacing the meter.

Adel #1A TBS Mods - project release
The Adel #1A TBS Mods Project was released to engineering.  This project wa=
s=20
a result of the customer wanting to convert an existing IT load at Adel #1A=
=20
to a Firm load.  The new Firm load will be 1400 mcf/day.   The project has =
a=20
targeted Nov 30, 2000 in-service date.  The station will have a new meter=
=20
installed along with piping size modifications.

Ethanol Injection
Reviewed and researched (for Marketing) the possibility of injecting Ethano=
l=20
into the pipeline for a possible "Green Energy" rating and as a means of BT=
U=20
enhancement.  Since ethanol would remain a liquid at any normal pipeline=20
conditions, even atomizing the ethanol at the point of injection would not=
=20
insure the Ethanol from liquefying, dropping out and collecting into the=20
pipeline low spots.  Also, there were many issues concerning possible liqui=
ds=20
entering the fuel systems of our equipment and other customers=01, equipmen=
t. =20
Planning recommended that this project not be pursued.

Researched (for Marketing) was the possibility of burning a Methane/Ethanol=
=20
mix in our equipment (i.e.: Turbines) in order to receive a "Green Power"=
=20
rating.  Solar was contacted concerning the possibility of "co-burning"=20
ethanol and methane.  As a manufacturer they said they would be willing to=
=20
work with us, however, they only recommended it if it were to be a constant=
=20
fuel source.  Solar said there would be considerable fuel injection system=
=20
retrofits required.  Also, if this were not a constant fuel then there woul=
d=20
have to be two separate fuel systems (co-burn and methane only) and a=20
complete fuel control system change.  With all that the project has been=20
deemed cost prohibitive.

Vapor Injection of Propane (VIP Service)
Research was started for Marketing into the possibility of injecting=20
vaporized propane into the pipeline as a way of increasing capacity during=
=20
peak days.  Upon initial review many questions were generated by the planni=
ng=20
team concerning specific requirements of the new service (i.e.: # of days/y=
r,=20
firm, daily firm etc.)  Planning awaits feedback from Marketing before any=
=20
more action is taken.

Electric Generation=20
Proposal was reviewed for Marketing from APA for an engineering study to=20
review the possibility of utilizing stand-by generators as electric produce=
rs=20
for the Utilities during peak power times in the summer months.  A few=20
discrepancies were found and are being worked out before APA can be release=
d=20
to complete the engineering study.

Beaver Dehy
A request was received from John Sturn of the optimization team to review t=
he=20
Capacity of the Mole sieve Dehy system at Beaver Compressor Station on the =
SE=20
24" line.  Beaver is considering a capital project to re-route the dehy=20
system that is currently piped into the suction of the station to the=20
discharge, thus increasing the capacity. =20

Cogentrix Power Plant
Three detailed cost estimates for the Cogentrix Power Plant proposals were=
=20
prepared and forwarded to Marketing.  The details of the cost estimate=20
included a breakdown of costs for:
Material Costs
Labor
Freight and Taxes
Surveys/Permits
Construction Support
District Labor
Engineering/Drafting/As-builts
Contingency
Overhead
AFUDC
The break down of costs was done for the Sheldon, Lehigh, and Raun projects=
=20
in Nebraska and Iowa.

Cherokee Ethanol Projects
Seven sites were examined for a proposed ethanol plant in Cherokee County,=
=20
Iowa.  The delivery volume was for 8 MMCF/D at a delivery pressure of 70=20
psig.  It was assumed for this study that the initial load would be for 4=
=20
MMCF/D for two years and then increase to the 8 MMCF/D level.  The cost=20
estimate assumed that the initial design would be for the 8 MMCF/D.  This w=
as=20
done to reduce the cost for the project.  Each cost estimate was done for a=
=20
firm transport level and an interruptible transport level (14 cost estimate=
s=20
total).  Two of the sites are on the C line approximately 10 miles southwes=
t=20
of the Paullina Station.  The remaining sites were on the Storm Lake/Lytton=
=20
Branchline.
