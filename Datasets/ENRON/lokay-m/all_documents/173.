Does your testing seem to be going ok?  I haven't heard from anyone yet.

Let Rich or myself know....

Subject: interactive open season test packages

The interactive open season test packages are loaded on ios.ets.enron.com.  
We put in the change where shippers must bid on the full capacity of the 
package, no partial capacities are allowed.  Even though the package with the 
3 month term has been loaded, we can remove it if we need to.  The following 
test user have been set up for testing.

user id  password package 15 volume package 16 volume

test1  user1  20000   0
test2  user2  20000   0
test3  user3  20000   0
test4  user4  20000   0
test5  user5  20000   49000
test6  user6  20000   49000
test7  user7  0   49000
test8  user8  0   49000
test9  user9  0   49000
test10  user10  0   49000

This iosadmin password is k97hyt86

Because the ios application hasn't been thoroughly used since February of 
1999, it is very important to do this testing.  I you need us to reset the 
bids or the end time, or if you notice any problems while testing, please 
page us at (877)497-3254.
