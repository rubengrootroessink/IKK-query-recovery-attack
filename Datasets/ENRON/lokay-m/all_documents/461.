Join a panel of Enron women whose lives have been touched by breast cancer.  
These celebrated women would like to share their experiences so that you can 
protect yourself and loved ones against the disease.

We will have registration forms and race info available.  We will also be 
offering phantom runner certificates for donations.  These certificates will 
be worn by Enron participants to celebrate or in memory of someone touched by 
breast cancer.

If you would like to participate in the race or attend the lunch, please 
contact Alice Hritz at 713-345-5543. Lunch will be provided.  Seating is 
limited.
