Also meant to tell you that Nicole Schwartz left Compaq last week and will
start at Enron this next Monday.  Look her up after she gets settled in.  I
told her you were there too.  Did you know her?  She worked for Linda a
while back, then transferred to campus on a special project with Michael
Takemura.  Then out of that to another group with Lisa Kaiser.
Just an FYI -
BYE!
