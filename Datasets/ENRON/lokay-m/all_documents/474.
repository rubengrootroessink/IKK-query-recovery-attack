Lindy -  We receive a report from IGS which does track the California 
deliveries of Kern River.  The remaining volumes, and we do assume that Kern 
River is 100% full, does get dropped off to the Nevada market.    Sometimes, 
the California deliveries are as low as 325 MMcf/d, which does indicate a 
strong Las Vegas/Nevada market demand.

Kern River's throughput to CA was only 59%?  Did they have an outage?  Is the 
remaining gas dropping-off before CA?  We usually assume in our gas flows 
analysis that Kern is 100% full.  This seems unusual.
