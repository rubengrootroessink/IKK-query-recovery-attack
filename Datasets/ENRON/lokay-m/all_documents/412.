GPG will begin gathering information in September for our migration to=20
Windows 2000 and Outlook/Exchange.

Windows 2000 (or W2K) is Microsoft's newest operating system and has been=
=20
selected as Enron's standard desktop operating system.  Along with this=20
change, we are moving from Lotus Notes to Outlook/Exchange as our standard=
=20
messaging (email) application. =20

This project is a huge undertaking, and we need everyone=01,s assistance to=
=20
ensure success.  The GPG-IT team will partner with each group to ensure eve=
ry=20
aspect is covered.   Each group (IT and the User group) will assign a Point=
=20
of Contact (POC) to  work with the IT group.  The POC's responsibilities=20
include application information gathering, identifying security requirement=
s,=20
documenting all issues and concerns, and communicating project status.

We are approaching the Windows 2000/Exchange Project in a phased approach.

Phase I, starting now and running through November, consists of =01&Informa=
tion=20
Gathering=018 about hardware, applications, issues, as well as application=
=20
testing in our Windows 2000 lab and user sign-off.  The Phase I findings wi=
ll=20
determine the Phase II start date.

Phase II, will be the actual =01&Implementation=018 of desktop hardware, Wi=
ndows=20
2000 and Outlook software, and user training.  We will also be migrating=20
"user" data on the network to a Windows 2000 file server and migrating=20
applications to a Windows 2000 application server.=20

Some of the benefits of migrating to W2K
Increased desktop reliability and response time.  Windows 2000 is much more=
=20
stable and robust than Windows 95/98/NT.
Increased system performance because minimum hardware requirements for W2K=
=20
are 350 MHz and above with 256 MEG memory. =20
Increased desktop manageability and enhanced functionality. =20
Single sign-on for all users/servers.  No more problems with trying to keep=
=20
all your LAN and email passwords the same!

Some of the impacts to migrating to W2K
Some of the old Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint or Access) documents will=
=20
need to be updated.  If you have any old documents that you think will not=
=20
move forward to W2K, please communicate this to your IT POC.=20
We are aware that some hardware and applications may have problems running =
in=20
Windows 2000.  We will work together to find a suitable solution for=20
everyone. =20

Another communication with much more detail regarding W2K and Outlook will =
be=20
coming soon. =20

If you have any questions, comments or issues, as always, please feel free =
to=20
contact your GPG support group directly.

Thanks. =20
