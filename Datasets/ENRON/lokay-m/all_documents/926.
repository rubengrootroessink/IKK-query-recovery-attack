Pipeline Operations - As of December, 1 TW is back to scheduling over 
1,054,000 MMBtu/d to the California border.  The preliminary indication on 
the corrosion dig-outs that occurred this week is the pipe appears to be OK 
but the final call will come from Max Brown's office shortly.  

Gas Inventory Sale - In preparation for the corrosion dig-outs this week, we 
assisted operations in relieving some line pressure by selling gas inventory 
at the Cal Border pool.  We sold 10,000 MMBtu for gas day 11/30 at 
$14.00/MMBtu.

Expired ROFR's - Two contract ROFR notifications expired this week 
(11/30/2000).  Both of these contracts will terminate next year 11/30/2001.  
Burlington has  15,000 MMBtu/d from  Ignacio to Blanco and PG&E has 20,000 
MMBtu/d from Blanco to EOT.  

Park N Ride - Eprime signed a 50,000 MMBtu/d park and ride agreement 
effective 12/01/2000.  Current posted rates are at max of .3883.
Invoices are going out next week.
