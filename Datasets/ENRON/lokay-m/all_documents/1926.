Christine:

POGO has requested a new interconnect with TW in Sec. 18, T22S, R32E of Lea 
County New Mexico.  There is a 4" on 24" existing tap at station # 612+14 
between Mile Post 11 & 12 south of WT-I, indentified by the local operations 
team.  The cost estimate below contains the usual and customary facility and 
equipment costs:  



 Chromatograph     $55,000
 H2O Monitor     $10,000
 H2S Monitor     $35,000
 EFM      $35,000
 Flow control     $34,000
 Positive shut-in     $22,000
 Flow bypass     $12,000
 Engi. CSUP, Contig.  $120,000
  Subtotal  $323,000 

 Tax Gross-up   $100,000 
  Total                       $423,000

These cost are identical to the EOG +/- 10% numbers from the E&C Team.  Once 
again, the turn around time is generally 90 days from work order generation 
to in-service reporting.  The equipment best case delivery is 45 days with 
about a 5 day turn around time in construction.  

Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.  3-0667
