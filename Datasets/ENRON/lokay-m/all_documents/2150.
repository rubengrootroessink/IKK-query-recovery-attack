Dear NESA/HEA Members:

Just a reminder that you should have received your renewal for 2001 in
December.  Your application is due by March 1, 2001, so don't delay in
returning your form and payment for $75 as soon as possible to ensure that
you are in this year's directory.  If you did not receive your renewal, you
can go to our website at www.nesanet.org and print an application to use.
Be sure and include your email address.

Also, ENERGY EXPO is right around the corner - March 20-22 at the George R.
Brown.  Delegate registration information is available at the website as
well.  Advance registration deadline is February 23rd, so get your
registration in to avoid the additional fee.  Make sure to attend the
General Session and come by the NESA/HEA booth for your chance in the prize
drawings!  Pipeline Updates will also be available during the trade show
hours, so don't miss this opportunity to gain some valuable industry insight
and information as well as catch up with your business contacts.  We'll see
you then!
