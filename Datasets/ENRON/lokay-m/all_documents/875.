Transport Options - FERC has issued a draft order suspending our proposed 
Transport Options tariff sheets until May 1, 2001 and accepting them subject 
to the outcome of a technical conference.  The technical conference is to 
take place within 120 days of the order and will address issues raised in 
protests.

CIG Tumbleweed - We are working with firm shippers on CIG who produce gas out 
of the Raton Basin and sell it into El Paso, NNG, and SPS/Nichols.  With 
current basis spreads going to California, the market may motivate the 
producers to move some primary firm transport gas onto the TW system.  

Burlington Resources - Burlington indicated this week they have signed the 
amended Val Verde interconnect and operating agreement and returned it to TW.

West Texas Gas - We executed an east to east deal with this co-op for 
$.065/MMBtu on volume of approximately 1500 MMBtu/d.

Allocation Extension - Capacity west on TW will be constrained an extra 3 
days till November 30.  The re-grout at station 4 was delayed by several days 
as extreme cold temperatures prevented the new grout from drying; they are 
also having difficulty getting the unit aligned.  Also, the piston rods on a 
unit at station 2 are being pulled and sent to Odessa, Texas for rebuild.
