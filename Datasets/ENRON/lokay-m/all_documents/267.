A hydrostatic test of Line 3201 identified some pipe that must be replaced, 
El Paso said Thursday, 
and once that is done the test must be performed again. It estimated the 
project will extend through 
Sunday, reducing Bondad Mainline capacity by 180 MMcf/d (normal capacity is 
675 MMcf/d) and 
affecting seven receipt points. With Line 3201 out of service, the 180 MMcf/d 
loss can not be made
 up at points downstream of Bondad Mainline, El Paso said. Thus the same (not 
additional) 
180 MMcf/d reduction must be applied at Gallup (NM) Station. 

PG&E Gas Transmission-Northwest said its Internet-based nomination system 
became operational 
again Thursday morning after a Wednesday evening power failure caused the 
server to crash. 

El Paso will hold meetings Aug. 9 in Houston, Aug. 10 in Los Angeles and Aug. 
11 in Phoenix to present 
details of its Line No. 2000 Project. The project requires FERC approval to 
abandon certain mainline 
compressor facilities and replace them with a 30-inch crude oil pipeline upon 
its conversion to natural 
gas service. El Paso announced early this year (see Daily GPI, Feb. 4) it was 
buying part of the 
All American Pipeline from Plains All American Pipeline L.P. and would invest 
$75 million to convert 
the segment to a natural gas pipeline. The segment being converted extends 
1,088 miles from Emidio, 
CA, to McCamey, TX. Those planning to attend one of next week's meetings 
should call Lisa Holmes at 
(915) 496-2568 or send e-mail to holmesl@epenergy.com.
