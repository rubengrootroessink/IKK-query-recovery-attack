As you know, the Enron Chairman=01,s Award program recognizes employees who=
 make=20
a difference, one day at a time, by living Enron=01,s Vision and Values in=
=20
everything they do. The program, which is 100 percent employee-driven,=20
enables all of us to nominate those of our fellow employees who we believe=
=20
exemplify the Enron values of Respect, Integrity, Communication and=20
Excellence.=20
This past October, the Employee Selection Committee reviewed all of the=20
nominations (425 of them from across Enron and from around the world), and=
=20
selected the 11 finalists who comprise the Chairman=01,s Roundtable. The wi=
nner=20
of the Chairman=01,s Award, EES employee Mark Harada, then was selected fro=
m=20
this group and announced at the Enron Management Conference in November 200=
0.
During the next couple of months, ETS is going to honor its 35 nominees,=20
including our two finalists for the award, by sharing the details of their=
=20
nominations with each of you. Our employees, like the nominees from the oth=
er=20
Enron companies, are everyday heroes who apply Enron=01,s values to their w=
ork,=20
their relationships and their communities.=20
This week, I salute the two Chairman=01,s Award finalists from ETS:
Amelia Alder
Craig Buehler
Amelia, an executive secretary in Houston, has taken excellence to new=20
heights. In 1996, Amelia led an 11 member cycling team for the Multiple=20
Sclerosis Society collecting $5,000 in pledges. Today, she has led this tea=
m=20
to be the nationally recognized event leader with over 350 riders and a top=
=20
fund-raiser with an amazing $500,000 in pledges! Thanks to Amelia's=20
involvement, 1 out of every 6 dollars raised for MS is connected to Enron's=
=20
name. Amelia's ability to communicate through cooperation and persuasion ha=
s=20
resulted in unprecedented recognition for Enron.=20
Craig, a senior analyst in Houston, has been identified as a "trendsetter"=
=20
regarding communication. Today, we take for granted the technology our=20
videoconference rooms provide us. But in the "early" days of Enron, in an=
=20
effort to bridge the gap between Omaha and Houston, he would videotape=20
individuals within groups and forward the film to the other location. He wa=
s=20
the human link that spanned two cities and helped two cultures become one. =
As=20
a tribute to his efforts, a large number of bonds exist today as a result o=
f=20
his efforts to promote a sense of esprit de corps and friendship. Craig was=
=20
also responsible for creating Enron Kids, now a favorite employee volunteer=
=20
activity during the holidays that gives students a complete outfit of=20
clothes, a pair of shoes, a jacket, a toy and a book.
Please join me in congratulating Amelia and Craig.
