You don't have to respond and put your job on the line!? I bought six tickets 
to Clay Walker, Saturday, Feb 17 at 1:00.? They were $12 each with a $5 
handling fee ($77 total).? Top rows, all that was left, but the coliseum is 
not nearly as big as the dome.? The coliseum is downtown, and I had to buy 
for Caroline and Meghan since they are 2.? Looking forward to it!? Talk 
later...
