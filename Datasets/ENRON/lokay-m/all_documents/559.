Eyes of Texas

A cowpoke in West Texas was herding cattle one day when he heard faint
music coming from nearby. After hunting about for a time, he discovered
the sound was loudest near one particular calf, and was even louder near
the calf's tail. Putting his head close to the calf's hind end, he heard
"The eyes of Texas are upon you, all the live long day..."

Amazed, he tossed the calf over his horse's back, mounted and rode
quickly to his line shack 10 miles away. There he put the calf into his
truck and drove 74 miles to Ft. Stockton, where he took the animal to a
vet.  When the vet asked him what was going on, the cowpoke told him,
and the vet went around behind the calf and gave a listen, too. He
agreed he heard "The eyes of Texas are upon you, you cannot get away..."
but didn't seem particularly excited.

"Man, how can you stand there and not be amazed?" the cowpoke asked.

The vet, a third generation Aggie, said, "Bud, I'm an Aggie, and I've
been listening to assholes sing the "Eyes of Texas" for years.
