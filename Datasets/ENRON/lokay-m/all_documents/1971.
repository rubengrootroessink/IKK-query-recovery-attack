Michelle:  here is the text for LFT and ITS-1, plus the FTS-1 again because I 
made some slight modifications.  Note my question on the LFT description.  
I'll do the daily FTS-1 text and send it to you in the next hour or so.  Lisa 
Lees called and said she's sending me something; I will look at this weekend 
if not today.
