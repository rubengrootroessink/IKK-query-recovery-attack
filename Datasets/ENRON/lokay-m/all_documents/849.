Agave Energy - Agave and another producer, Comanche Gathering, are both 
looking to bring new gas onto TW's system in the Panhandle area.  We are 
reviewing available taps to bring 5-10,000 MMBtu/d into the system.  

EOG Resources - The new EOG well began flowing 13,500 MMBtu/d on 11/15 into 
the West Texas lateral.

PG&E - PG&E indicated this week they will increase TW's deliverability by 25% 
from 300,000 to 400,000 MMBtu/d at Topock effective December 1.  This is a 
huge benefit as we look for ways to maximize revenue for 2001.  
Congratulations to all the field operations personnel who contributed to 
resolving our contamination issues with PG&E on a timely basis while building 
an atmosphere of trust and credibility.  All the work is paying off.

Market spreads between production basins and the California border shot up 
this week then contracted by Thursday as weather fears and storage shortages 
across the US pushed prices up and down.  We successfully negotiated the 
following record-setting deals on TW:

 PG&E Trading - 30,000 MMBtu IT for 11/15 @ $0.90/MMBtu
 PG&E Trading - 30,000 MMBtu IT for 11/16 @ $.075/MMBtu
 Sempra             -  10,000 MMBtu LFT for December 1-31 @ $1.00/MMBtu

Transport Options - Our recent FERC filing is on the Commission's docket for 
next Tuesday November 21.  We expect the Commission to order a technical 
conference maybe before the end of the year.

NGPL - Producers behind Marathon's Indian Basin plant are trying to move 
additional volume to TW via the recently reactivated NGPL Winkler 
interconnect.  NGPL is evaluating cost options to add compression; this would 
also help us sell the point as a firm receipt point and extract more value.
