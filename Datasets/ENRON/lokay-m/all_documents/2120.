Michelle sent me the attached (different version) this morning for approval 
where she changed the first paragraph.  I've reviewed the original version 
Susan Scott just sent as well.  It appears that most of the changes were just 
spelling out "Transwestern."  I am ok with both versions as long as we have 
the July, 2000 date correct.  Please send me the final version that goes out 
for my records.

Michelle, as I mentioned in my voice mail, the other lawyers wanted a few 
changes.  My sincerest apologies for the confusion.  Apparently you and I 
were actually working off an old version of FGT's letter, not the one they 
ultimately approved and used.  Since you are out of the office, I've taken 
the liberty of forwarding it to Carl without you reviewing it first, since I 
know we want to mail this out soon.  

Carl, Michelle advised me that EOL's lawyer had approved the previous version 
so I assume they will want to review this one as well.  Let me know if there 
are any concerns.

Thanks!
