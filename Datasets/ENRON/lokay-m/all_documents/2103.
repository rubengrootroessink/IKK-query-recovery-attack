Please attend a meeting on Tuesday, 1/30 from 1:00-2:30 in the EB4102/Oma696 
to discuss the development/implementation of the TW Dashboard.  We will give 
a presentation of the Marketing Dashboard and then have a brainstorming 
session on the possible types of information each of you need to manage your 
day-to-day business.  

We would like to make sure everyone is using the new Dashboard so please 
click here to access - http://nahou-wwrms02p.ets.enron.com/ .   Your ID and 
password are the same as your current LogonID (ex.llindber for Lorraine).    
Please click on the NNG tab and think about which of those categories as well 
as what additional type of information you would like on the TW tab.

We are expecting to kick off the requirements phase of your Pipeline Profile 
next month so we will also give you a quick presentation of the NNG Pipeline 
Profile that has been developed.

Please contact myself at x3-7275 or Bobby Mason at x3-5196 is you have any 
questions or if you are unable to attend.   

Thanks!   Martha
