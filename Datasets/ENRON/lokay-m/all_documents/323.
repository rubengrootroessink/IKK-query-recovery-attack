I have set up your user id and password on the ET&S intranet.  It will allow 
you to see the marketing reports, TW Marketing, and ET&S updates.  Your user 
id and password are both "mlokay".  Please change your password by going to 
http://home.ets.enron.com and pressing the "Change User Info" link on the 
navigation bar.
