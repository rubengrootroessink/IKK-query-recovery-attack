Have you taken the time to consider those employees that consistently make a 
difference at Enron and should be considered for the Chairman's Award?  It's 
those special individuals around us that bring our values to life...  Please 
make sure your everyday hero is recognized by simply submitting a nomination 
form on their behalf during this final week.  

Every employee nominated will receive a memento honoring their nomination and 
the ten heroes the most exemplify our values will claim their place on the 
prestigious Chairman's Roundtable.  To see who's being nominated by business

Ken, Jeff and Joe
