I'm preparing a "cheat sheet" for Steve for a presentation he is making 
tomorrow.  There is a slide about our new or proposed supply interconnects.  
Please send me an email with the capacity/volume and projected in-service (or 
if it's already in-service) for your project.  If I have the wrong people, 
please let me know.

Please send this to me this afternoon by 4:30.  Thank you!!
