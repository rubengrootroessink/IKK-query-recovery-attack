On Friday, January 26, 2001, an earthquake rocked the western region of 
India. The earthquake reportedly had a magnitude of  7.9 and was centered in 
the state of Gujarat. Initial reports indicate the death toll to be at least 
15,000. Most of the damage was reported in Ahmedabad, the state's commercial 
center.

Enron has a significant business presence in India. It has E&P interests off 
the Gujarat coast and is the majority owner of the Dabhol Power project, 
ultimately a 2,184 MW (net) generating plant, serving consumers in the state 
of Maharashtra, which borders Gujarat to the south. Consequently, Enron Oil 
and Gas India Limited (EOGIL), Enron India and DPC have mobilized staff and 
resources in India to tangibly assist the relief effort (e.g. contributing 
emergency medical supplies).    

Enron employees are encouraged to donate to relief efforts and to take 
advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your 
donation.  Enron will match, dollar for dollar, every donation that you make, 
up to $15,000 annually per employee.  Listed below are a multitude of 
organizations that are offering aid to the victims of this earthquake.  To 
print a Matching Gift form, please click here << File:
