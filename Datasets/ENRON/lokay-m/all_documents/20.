Toby, attached is the EnronOnline Customer letter from Steve Harris that is 
to be posted Monday morning (6/12).  Julia would also like for it to be auto 
faxed to our TW customers the same day and forwarded out to the troops as you 
usually do.  As an FYI, we only have a limited amount of the brochures, so I 
will ask Alma to place some of them at the fax center.  If you could, please 
make that note of that in your e-mail.

Please delete the word attachment at the bottom of the page before you post 
it.

Thanks for your help!!!
Ricki
