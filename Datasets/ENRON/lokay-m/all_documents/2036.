I know what I think of this deal, but I'd like to hear your thoughts.  Just 
some numbers to think about while you're mulling this deal over.  The deal 
provides for a doubling of the reservation charges/mo. from approx. $90K to 
$180K.  Then, USGT has an option on traunches of $.10, $.20 and $.38 capacity 
to move gas west on an alt. basis.  The current (paper) market for Permian to 
Cal. Border during the period is in the range of $1.00.  All other terms are 
the same, including the "sharing mechanism."
