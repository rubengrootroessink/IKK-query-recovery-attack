Subject: Nutcracker Outing

I am trying to get some of the details for the Nutcracker Preview Party (PP) 
taken care of because my schedule over the next 4 weeks is hectic.  Michelle 
has graciously voluntered to be in charge of the invitations, Audrey could 
you please work with PF Changs to set up the Happy Hour (HH) there?

There will be a total of 22 people invited to the HH and PP.  Last year PF 
Changs set up the appropriate # of tables in a corner by the window which was 
great.  Maybe we could get a similar setup this year.

Michelle - we'll forward a copy of a previous invitation to you to work 
from.  

Audrey - the HH should be from 4 - 6:30
