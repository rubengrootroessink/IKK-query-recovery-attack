OK now that I have your attention...   Mark your calendar for Tuesday,
August 14th for NESA/HEA's 5th Annual Sporting Clays Tournament to be held
again at the American Shooting Centers!  Prepare yourself for the energy
industry's premier shoot-out - remember last year's 13 gun, $11,000
give-away?  Keep watching your email for upcoming details and registration
information!

Tournament changes and a completely redesigned Two Man Flush game will
better accommodate the shooters in this great event.  Those who register and
pay by August 1, 2001 are automatically registered for a "private drawing"
sponsored by CORAL ENERGY for a brand new shotgun, in addition to all the
other great door prizes!  So get your shotgun out, put your team together
and send in your registration information once it's provided.

Thanks in advance to many of our last year sponsors who have already
committed to sponsorship this year as well as some new sponsors: CORAL
ENERGY RESOURCES, L.P.; DUKE ENERGY FIELD SERVICES; EL PASO FIELD SERVICES;
ENTEX GAS RESOURCES; HOUSTON PIPE LINE COMPANY; MITCHELL GAS SERVICES;
RELIANT ENERGY FIELD SERVICES; RELIANT ENERGY PIPELINE SERVICES; RELIANT
ENERGY SERVICES; AND SID RICHARDSON.
