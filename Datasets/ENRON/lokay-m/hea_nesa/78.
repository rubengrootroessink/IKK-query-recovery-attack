Attached please find the cover letter from Tournament Chairman Michael
Roberts plus a pdf file with all the events' information and registration
form.  Please read the cover letter as we have instituted several changes
for this year's tournament. 

Also, I've attached a pledge form if your company hasn't already committed
to a sponsorship for this year.  Your support ensures the success of this
event which has been a long industry tradition.  Don't miss this year's
tournament!
