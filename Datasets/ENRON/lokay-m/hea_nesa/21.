Michelle Lokay,

There are limited places for golfers, and still plenty of room for tennis, 
gin and bowling, so get your registration in!

GOLFERS - watch your email Wed. for pairings and tee assignments.

If you haven't registered at all, click on 
http://www.houstonenergy.org/public/sportscover.doc and do so now.  See you 
next Monday, October 16th!
