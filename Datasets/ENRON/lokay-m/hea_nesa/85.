For those of you who have registered for the NESA/HEA Sporting Clays
Tournament to be held on Tuesday, August 14th, there will be a Practice
Shoot offered on Monday, August 13th from noon until 4 p.m.  The American
Shooting Center is charging $21 for 50 targets and $35 for 100 targets, and
you can come as a team or you will be grouped on a first come, first served
basis.  SHELLS ARE NOT INCLUDED!  No reservations are required.

There will also be a drawing for a gun during the Practice Shoot which will
be awarded around 4:15 p.m.  You must be present to win!  

If you haven't yet registered for this great outing, you have until tomorrow
to be automatically entered in a private drawing by submitting your payment
with your registration.  Registrations will continue to be accepted until
Monday, August 13th, but those received after August 1 will not be eligible
for this private drawing.

The "Two Man Flush Game" is new and improved!  This old game with NEW RULES
will have a payout to at least three teams and is designed to support
multiple payouts based on participation.  Although you may shoot as a
participant on several teams, each Shooter will receive only the highest
award that they qualify for.  This will distribute the Game Pot among
several winners!  Thanks to Enterprise for sponsoring this side event.

Thanks additionally to all our great sponsors - Dinner prepared by Cullen
Ranch, underwritten by Mitchell Gas Services and TexLa Energy Management.
