Dear NESA/HEA Members:

In an effort to control costs and to provide more timely, current
information, we are considering putting the annual directory online via our
website.  We want your opinion regarding your personal preference, so please
take a minute to reply to this email noting the following options below and
underlining your choice.  I appreciate your input and hope you have a great
weekend.

*	MAINTAIN THE PRINTED DIRECTORY ONLY
*	PROVIDE AN ELECTRONIC, ONLINE VERSION ONLY WITH UPDATE CAPABILITY
*	PROVIDE BOTH A PRINTED AND ELECTRONIC VERSION
*	MAKE A CD VERSION AVAILABLE TO THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE ONLINE
CAPABILITY.
