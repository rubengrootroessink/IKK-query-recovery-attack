for a date with NESA and lots of mud bugs!  Join us from 5:00 p.m. until 8
p.m. at our 10th Annual Crawfish Boil at Woodrow's (3111 Chimney Rock) for
crawfish, jambalaya, beer and margaritas - all for $25 in advance or $30 at
the door!

		Just complete the bottom portion of this email and reply to
me, or print it off and fax to our office at 713/856-6199.  You can use your

advance will be eligible for a private drawing for HOUSTON TEXAN tickets; a
second drawing for ASTROS dugout tickets (compliments of MICHAEL ROBERTS
with Cinergy) will apply for the member who brings the most guests with
them.
