Would love to attend, but I will be out on vacation.  Can I have a copy of 
any notes that are taken?

Sorry about my incomplete memo (I hit send instead of save).

Anyway, we would like to set-up a two hour meeting for Thursday, August 3rd 
to discuss the variables for modeling westward throughput on TW (to forecast 
fuel).  This will be a brainstorming session to discuss the various impacts 
on the level of throughput, such as, hydro levels, weather, prices, 
seasonality, etc.  Please let me know if morning or afternoon on the 3rd is 
good for you.

Thanks,
Lindy
