Hi Teresa,
Believe it or not, I just got my directory...I guess they finally figured out 
where I am located!  I also found out that I need to correct the company for 
my directory information.  It needs to be Enron Transportation & Storage 
instead of Enron Corporation.  Thanks and talk to you soon!
