Michelle:

The intial agreement Bob presented to EOG was for $10,000, this was to cover 
the cost to refurbishing the existing 6" tap.  The work order was generated 
with this amount so that the R-O-W folks would intiate a Landowner 
notification letter ASAP.  EOG estimated a 5 - 15 mmcfd volume and they were 
to supply all materials to re-activate this point.   A scope change was 
intiated and we were to supply the EFM for their meter tube,  a verbal cost 
estimate to Bob in the amount of $35,000 was relayed.  A third scope change 
raised the volume estimate to over 20 mmcfd, which normally means we install 
additional instrumentation.  Operations at this time insisted we add the 
needed equipment to the work order.  The E&C folks then put out the tighter 
cost estimate of $422,000.  This included the following cost revisions:

 Chromatograph     $55,000
 H2O Monitor     $10,000
 H2S Monitor     $35,000
 EFM      $35,000
 Flow control     $34,000
 Positive shut-in     $22,000
 Flow bypass     $12,000
 Engi. CSUP, Contig.  $120,000
 Tax Gross-up   $100,000 
  Total   $423,000

Call me if you have any questions, PT 3-0667.
