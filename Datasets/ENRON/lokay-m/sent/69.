Do you know  about the variable costs?  I don't think any of the Park and 
Rides have ever been analyzed in Deal Profitability?!?!

Kim,

You might want to get on the distribution of this report.  I have wondered 
and asked the question "Do we always cover variable operating costs on our 
park and ride deals"?  A ride can have a very negative impact on fuel use.  
Doesn't the Deal Analysis cover park & ride deals?  You might want to check 
into this.

Thanks........Terry
