Subject: TRAVEL CONTEST -- XMS WEB EXPENSE REPORT

VISIT OUR INFORMATION WEB SITE AT http://xmsap.enron.com,  to enter a contest 
to win two tickets on Continental Airlines compliments of

     TRAVEL AGENCY IN THE PARK

Simply logon to the site, find the names of the five icons on the xmsap web 
page, make a list, and send it via e-mail to Andy Zabriskie, Accounts Payable 
Manager.  The Travel Agency in the Park on-site representative will draw a 
name from those submitting correct answers.

The contest ends Friday, November 10th.  The drawing will take place 
Wednesday, November 15th--just in time to make those reservations for a 
holiday ski trip!

TIP:  We were able to load 80% of the domestic employees based on their HR 
profile information.  
  Logon ID :  Your eHRonline logon (alternatively, your first initial and 
last name).
  Password:  ENRON (case-sensitive--be certain to change your password the 
first time you long on).
If you forgot your "P" number for your HR eWorkplace log on, call the 
Resolution Center, 713-853-1411 and ask them to check your XMS logon ID for 
you, 713-853-1411.  If you are a new employee or you are unable to logon as 
instructed above (one of those we could not load from HR), submit an eRequest 
through the IT Central web page (hhtp://itcentral.enron.com)
