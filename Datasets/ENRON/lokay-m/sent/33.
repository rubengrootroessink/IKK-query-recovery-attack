I'll contact internet team with this problem.  In the meantime, if you could 
get out of explorer and come back in to try
it again, I think the message will go away and the point drop down box will 
work.   Let me know.  Sorry for the
inconvience.

Thanks,
Mei-Ling

Mei-Ling, the TWDP model seems to have a recurring problem.
Do you have time to address the error this week?
I will try to run TWDP from my computer later today to see if it's 
operational.
Thanks,
Ken

Subject: Problems with the Deal Profitability Model?

Hello Marketing,
I'm looking for feedback regarding the TW Deal Profitability model.  There 
were some problems a few weeks ago but I'm assuming they have been resolved 
since no one is saying anything.

Have there been any problems accessing the website?  Are there any issues 
you'd like to raise?  The sooner I know, the sooner we can get started on 
improving/troubleshooting the model.

I'm not sure I have all the users on the mailing list so please inform those 
I may have inadvertently left out.  I look forward to hearing from you.
Thanks,
Ken
