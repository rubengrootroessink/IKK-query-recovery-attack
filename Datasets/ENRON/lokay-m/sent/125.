Yes, these numbers are the posted volumes according to their bulletin board.  
Update, as of 01/23...PG&ETop is 699 (61%), SoCalEhr is 1195 (96%), and 
SoCalTop ios 538 (100%).  These volumes are slightly above last week's 
posting.  I was told that the board was the official source for throughput 
information; but, I will see if there is another source.

Are you absolutely positive about these numbers? With all the problems in CA 
how could El Paso not be flowing more at Topock? I know we are taking up part 
of the space but it seems like they should be full to SoCal as well. Please 
reconfirm with other sources.
