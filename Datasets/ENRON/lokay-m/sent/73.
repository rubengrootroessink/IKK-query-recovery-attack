Open season responses are due from shippers on Friday 11/17.  Please make 
sure you canvass all your customers to find out who plans to respond and who 
doesn't.  I would like to submit to Steve a list of who we expect to see 
responses from, their anticipated volume, term, and price they're willing to 
pay.
thanks
KH

This week, make sure you call all your customers (if you haven't already 
spoken with them) and discuss the non-binding open season.  Answer any 
questions they might have, and reiterate the response deadline.  See if you 
can get an idea if they plan on responding one way or the other.  

thanks
KH
