Subject: Problems with the Deal Profitability Model?

Hello Marketing,
I'm looking for feedback regarding the TW Deal Profitability model.  There 
were some problems a few weeks ago but I'm assuming they have been resolved 
since no one is saying anything.

Have there been any problems accessing the website?  Are there any issues 
you'd like to raise?  The sooner I know, the sooner we can get started on 
improving/troubleshooting the model.

I'm not sure I have all the users on the mailing list so please inform those 
I may have inadvertently left out.  I look forward to hearing from you.
Thanks,
Ken
