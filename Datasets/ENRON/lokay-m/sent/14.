Cathy Bulf (918-591-5143) just called to negotiate the contract extension.  
Capacity is 10000 to Needles and 10000 to Topock, both expiring end of Jan 
2001.  Her bids are through Oct 2001 at .16 plus fuel or through Mar 2002 at 
current rate of .131 plus fuel.  What is our strategy?  The spreads have 
tightened since last week.  She has to be notified by ASAP, so she can 
exercise her ROFR.

KN (Oneok) called to get more information about the Right of First Refusal in 
their current contract.  The minimum requirement to keep ROFR in a contract 
extension is with maximum rate for at least 1 year.  Cathy Bulf will let TW 
know by Monday, and in writing, if they would like to exercise.
