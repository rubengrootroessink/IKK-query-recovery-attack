Hey there, I got a call from Marta in your HR about some type of "Financial Portfolio Managment" deal.  The VP is TIm Kramer.  It sounded like some type of Risk and Control, analytical position as opposed to trading.  So I told here I was not interested for now.  Anyway just wondering if you knew anything about this group, if it's something I should look at.  Thanks buddy.
