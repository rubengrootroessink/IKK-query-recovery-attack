Hey Dude,
=20
Yeah the compnay is toast.  The story gets stranger every day.  Half of the=
 Houston office was laid off early December.  More to come I am sure.  My g=
roup was purchased by UBS Warburg.  I am fortunate that they offered me a j=
ob.  A bunch of guys in my group were not.  I feel lucky, things could be m=
uch worse for me, but instead I have an opportunity to be part of a pretty =
impressive organization.  Work has a actually been a little strange, since =
the company had declared bankruptcy we litterally have nothing to do.  Sinc=
e the first week of Dec, I've been going to work for maybe a couple hours a=
 day, just hanging out, talking to the other guys, surfin the net.  It give=
s me the chance to take care of all the errand type stuff I normally don't =
have a chance to.  I've been cooking a lot, taking care of my backyard, sel=
lin shit on ebay, stuff like that.  Some of the other traders have been rea=
ding trading books and stuff, but you know me...  By the way my permanent h=
ome email is now esaibi@houston.rr.com <mailto:esaibi@houston.rr.com>.

I got your card that you sent to Adnan.  Thanks.  I'm not sure if I told yo=
u, but I bought a house here a few months back.  When my Dad was planning t=
o move here I thought it would be better to buy a place instead of renting =
a big apt.  It's brand new, location is pretty good in that it is near a lo=
t of things.  Although the area right around here is a bit sketchy.  I figu=
re it'll probably get better over time.  I hope things are going well for y=
ou.  When will you visit the U.S?  If you ever visit LA let me know.  I cou=
ld always meet you there if you give me enough notice.  As you can imagine,=
 airline tickets are pretty cheap these days.

Can you believe Khan is married?  It was kinda strange cuz I was pretty muc=
h the only one of his friends involved in the wedding.  His brother and fam=
ily were able to show up for the ceremony at least.  That was good.  It was=
 a bit difficult because my Dad passed away the morning of his wedding, but=
 I knew I couldn't leave him then.  Khan has some pictures if he hasn't sho=
wn you any yet.  He sent me a couple.  Well I gotta go to bed soon.  I'll d=
o a better job keeping in touch.  It's just been a little difficult lately,=
 I'm sure you understand.  Don't work too hard.

Check out these links re: my ebay success.  I got some heat about the chron=
 article.  They generally frown upon talking to the press at work.  This st=
uff actually has been selling far above what the articles say, insane!
