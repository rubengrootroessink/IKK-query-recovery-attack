This is to invite you to a meeting on dynamic schedules and responsibility transfers that will be conducted by ERCOT on Wednesday, June 6, 2001. ERCOT will present the ways in which dynamic schedules and RTs will be accomplished per the current system design and protocols with examples of various scenarios to walk through the roles and responsibilities of the parties involved. A document on the ERCOT system design regarding these issues will be e-mailed to market participants by Monday June 4, 2001. The examples presented in the document will be the basis for discussions and time will be allocated for questions and answers on each topic.

Here is a tentative agenda for the meeting: 

9:30 a.m. to 12:00 noon - Dynamic Schedules (Examples and Q&A) 
12:00 noon to 1:00 p.m. - Lunch (will be provided) 
1:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m.   - Responsibility transfers (Examples and Q&A) 

The discussion on RTs may start before lunch if time allows and continue after lunch.  There may also be a discussion of system design and protocol changes needed to implement RTs for balancing energy and capacity auctions.

The meeting will be held at the Austin Airport Hilton, 9515 New Airport Drive: Telephone (512) 385-6767. A conference call line will be set up for those unable to attend and the number to call in will be communicated along with the document mentioned above.
