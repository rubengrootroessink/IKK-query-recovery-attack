**Online Auction Site Dedicated to Sports Cards and Collectibles***
Website: http://www.sccauctions.com

Nowadays, one of the best places to buy sportscards and collectibles is in online auctions. It is exciting to bid in auctions and you can almost always find great deals. The problem with most online auctions is they sell EVERYTHING. What collectors need is a website designed specifically for them.
That is where we come in.

  * MultiBidding (Bidding on many cards at once)
  * Owned and operated by collector's
  * Cost - A great selection of cards for far less than the competition
  * You can make money by referring your friends to us
  * Book value for every card listed
  * Convenient closing times
  * Fast, superior invoicing
  * Costs less to sell on SCC Auctions **$19.95/month for unlimited items**
  * Advanced search features, including searching by book value
