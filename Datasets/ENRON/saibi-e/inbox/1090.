Attached you will find an excel document. The outage contained within is
a rescheduled outage. Your daily delivery will still contain this
outage.

In addition to the excel document, there is a dbf file that is formatted
like your daily delivery you receive nightly. This will enable you to
load the data into your regular database. Any questions please let me
know. Thanks.
