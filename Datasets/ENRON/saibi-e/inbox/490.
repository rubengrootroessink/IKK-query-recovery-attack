We are short 100 mw's in the Ercot Asset book for hours ending 7-22.    We want to remain that way,  unless the balancing energy market goes haywire.
We would need to delete our SC counterparty EL Paso and input a replacement QSE in the portal if this is filled.
Enpower shows 100 mw's coming from Ercot imbalance.

This deal would need to be cut and replaced with the power that was purchased for bal-day,  etc.


Thanks,
JMF
