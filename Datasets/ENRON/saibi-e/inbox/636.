I apologize for the mass email to everybody. Some  of you are hearing from me out of the blue and others I may not have kept in  touch with quite as much (but neither did you!). In any case I hope you are all  doing well. 
 
As you know I have been working from home these  past few months - it's been nice; but I have started to get quite a few crank  calls, at odd hours. Therefore, from now on, you will not be able to get a voice  response at my old number (949) 387-9492 - this will be my fax. My voice number  will be (949) 387-9493. Sometimes in this high tech world its nice to just have  to switch the plugs!! (of course I'm also curious to see how long it will be  till the rest of the world will figure this out). I can still also be reached at  my cell phone (949) 307-6512
 
Please, keep these numbers in confidence, and do  not share them with anyone. Thank you all. 
 
Regards,
Adnan Khan
CEO Khan Ventures, LLC
