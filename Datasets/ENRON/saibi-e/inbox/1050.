I updated the list when I received it and saved it in the M:Electric/24HOUR/GeorgePhillips/24HourCallList directory.

George,  was it you that created a counterparty list?   We need to distribute to the new traders asap. 
We are to have a meeting this week to discuss expectations and immediate goals (making money). 

give me a call when you get the chance. 

Thanks, 
JMF
