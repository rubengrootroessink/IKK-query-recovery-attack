Welcome to Advantage, the new monthly newsletter from the Associate & Analyst Program. We're a big family - we have close to 850 associates and analysts working all over the globe - and we want to keep you current on what's going on. We have new programs, perspectives and opportunities to tell you about, as well as births, marriages and social events. We know you don't have much time, so we will use this newsletter as a quick way to stay in touch.

We're welcoming our latest class of 200 or so Associates and Analysts who have recently joined Enron. Newcomers and "old-timers" will find that the A&A Program is a great foundation for their careers at Enron. Some of our activities are learning experiences, and some are just plain fun. But they all help to build your network within Enron, which you will draw on frequently in the years ahead.

So here's to a great Fall. I look forward to seeing some of you this month at our pizza and brown-bag lunches and at other occasions. Let me know how things are going. And let's stay in touch.

Regards,
Billy Lemmons 
VP/ A&A Program

Fall Recruiting Season Kick-off
It's a great time to be recruiting new Associates and Analysts to Enron. While other organizations have cut back on new hires, Enron's appetite for new talent remains robust. In this environment, we expect to recruit the best of the best. We're visiting a broader list of universities than ever before. In the past we may have preferred hiring students from only a select group of schools.  The reality is that we value diversity and top performers come from many different schools.  As such, we think it is best to cast a wider, shallower net, rather than go too deep into the talent pool in only a few places.  

We need your help. The A&A program is introducing a more targeted approach to recruiting, so we can focus on the best prospects. We would like to use you, and others like you - alumni, former residents of the state and people who are just excited to be at Enron - to "close the deal" by communicating our story. Nothing's better than personal experience to prove that the opportunities here truly are limitless. If you are interested in helping out, e-mail Traci Warner at traci.warner@enron.com <mailto:traci.warner@enron.com>. 


The Quarterly Event Is Now a Chance to Help
Wednesday, Sept. 19, was supposed to be a night of joy, a chance for everyone to welcome our new Associates and Analysts at our first Houston Quarterly Event at Bossa. In light of last week's terror and destruction, we are turning the occasion into a kick-off of a week-long book drive. We are asking pool members to purchase a children's book and inscribe a special message to a child who has been touched by this tragedy. We hope this small act of hope and caring gives emotional support to families during this time of need.

If you would like to make a cash donation to help with Enron's relief effort, matching gift forms will be available at the gathering, and Enron will match your contribution 2 to 1.

For more information or to reserve your place, please RSVP to Donna Jones at ext. 3-3175 or Jackie Coleman at ext. 5-4070.

The Book Drive at Bossa
Sept. 19 from 5:30 p.m. to 9 p.m.
610 Main Street, Houston
