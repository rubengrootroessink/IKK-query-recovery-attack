 =09 =09    Dear Eric,  Tuesday could be a pivotal day for energy on Capito=
l Hill.  Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says a cloture vote on the Sena=
te floor could effectively kill efforts by some Senate Republicans to force=
 a comprehensive energy bill to the floor.  Republicans are trying to attac=
h energy legislation to a defense-spending bill while Democrats opposing th=
e move are using their control of the Senate to fight it.  We'll have the v=
ery latest from the Washington bureau on Tuesday.     Peter also says the b=
ureau will be covering a hearing Tuesday in the Senate Energy Committee to =
discuss the proposed natural gas pipeline that would connect Alaska to the =
lower 48 states.  The witness list includes Alaska Governor Tony Knowles, F=
ERC Chairman Pat Wood and Williams CEO Keith Bailey.  Among other issues, S=
enators are expected to question claims from the industry that the pipeline=
 would cost too much to build.  Gas Daily Assistant Editor Nathan Hodge wil=
l drop by during the 9:00 a.m. ET newscast to give us his take on where the=
 project stands.    On Monday, Rep. Joe Barton (R) Texas and some Texas mem=

nts to introduce legislation to fill the country's SPR sites.   Rep. Barton=
 says he has support for the legislation as a way to protect the nation's p=
etroleum supply, especially following the recent attacks on America.  We'll=
 bring you updates from Rep. Barton's trip tomorrow.   Also from Houston, T=
exas PUC Chairman Max Yzaguirre will talk about upcoming deregulation and t=

he competition begins in January.  Don't miss Yzaguirre from the Houston bu=
reau on Tuesday.   ENL's Kym McNicholas reports, the California Public Util=
