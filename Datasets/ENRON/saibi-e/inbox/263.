No... I think that is all that can be done. You could give hime a partial
refund for the shipping amount or something.

Hey I sent this guy a food processor for about $30 that apparently got
damaged in the mail. He admittedthat it was packed well, but asked me what
"suggestions" I had.  I did not offer him insurance nor did he request it.
So I don't feel I am responsible.  He probably agrees although he is not
happy about getting a useless item.  I was going to write him back saying
sorry, but I don't feel responsible.  The USPS damaged the product and we
did not agree to have it shiupped insured.  Would you suggest something
different?
