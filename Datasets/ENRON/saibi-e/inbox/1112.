Dear MetrixND Users,

Based on the results of our recent user survey regarding what Windows
platforms you are using, we have decided to eliminate testing and support of
MetrixND version 3.0 on Windows 95.  The small fraction of you that are
currently running a Windows 95 environment will need to upgrade to at least
Windows 98 to run MetrixND version 3.0.  RER will still support previous
versions of MetrixND that run on Windows 95, however we encourage all users
to run the most current version.

MetrixND version 3.0 will be tested on the following platforms:

  -Windows 98
  -Windows 2000
  -Windows NT version 4.0 or higher
  -Windows ME
  -Windows XP

If you have any questions, please contact Frank Monforte or me.
