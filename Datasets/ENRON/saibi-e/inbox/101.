That stuff on e-bay was cool.  At least you made  use of some of your Enron=
 stuff.  It's great to hear that you're working  for UBS Warburg.  Which gr=
oup are you with now? =20

I think my dad is planning a trip to the Chicago Food  Show sometime in May=
.  I'm not sure on how that will go, but I may join him  then.  I also need=
 to drop by Saint Louis to renew my driver's  license.  Besides, I haven't =
been back since graduation.  Adnan told  me that you just bought a place.  =
It would be great to visit you and Texas  for the first time.  I may stay l=
onger with you guys (I also have a friend  living in Austin) before I final=
ly come back home. =20

My parents and I are going to China in March, and I was  surprised that the=
y're asking my girlfriend to go along with us.  The Wash  U International A=
dvisory Council Meeting will be held in China in March and I  will just cat=
ch them for their last leg. =20

Business in the Philippines is really bad, and it's not  going anywhere in =
the near future.  I had this deal with Adnan last  December to January.  He=
 wanted me to sell used hard disks to prospective  buyers in the Philippine=
s.  I found one group and it took a long time to  get the goods here and ou=
t of customs.  Finally, during the first week of  January, the goods were r=
eleased and shit turned worse.  The buyer claimed  that we shipped him 95% =
defective items.  Out of the 400+ hard drives,  around 200 had bad sectors =
(which were deemed to be good drives by most people),  21 were good, and th=
e balance were either not detected or had this knocking  sound.  Anyway, I =
think Adnan was willing to give him some sort of refund  on the balance, bu=
t the guy kept on insisting for Adnan not to negotiate the  letter of credi=
t.  The whole thing was so fucked up, and the guy was  implying that he was=
 going to sue me for intentionally scamming him off  US$6,800.  I couldn't =
believe that he would think that I would destroy my  credibility for such a=
 small amount of money.  Anyway, the problem seems to  be hanging out there=
, but the buyer had some fishy stuff going.  He called  me to go to his pla=
ce and, when I arrived, they have finished testing all the  drives.  I mean=
, they should have waited for me to get there before testing  at least half=
 of the drives for their own protection.  Now, we could not  tell whether t=
he drives that were displayed (and they were displayed in an  extremely org=
anized manner) were actually ours or not.  Second, his  unwillingness to ta=
ke a refund instead of stopping the LC negotiation is  somewhat irregular. =
 We were thinking that maybe he doesn't have enough  funds in the bank or s=
omething to cover his line.  Third, he wanted to send  back all goods and c=
harge it to us.  That way, if he indeed changed our  good drives with defec=
tive ones, he would have gotten 400 good drives and gotten  rid of his bad =
ones free of charge.  Adnan shipped 200 drives from the same  lot to his da=
d in Pakistan, and they came out around 12% defective.  Even  at that level=
, 50% seems to be too far away.  So, there, since we haven't  negotiated th=
e letter of credit yet (it should be done within this week), I  haven't hea=
rd from the buyer.  I would not be surprised if I receive some  subpoena or=
 something from the bastard after we negotiate the LC.  Anyway,  I asked my=
 lawyer, and he said that there is really not much of a case on his  side. =
 Besides, all documents were made by Adnan and him.  He cannot  sue Adnan, =
so his only choice is to sue me ... if that's what he wants.   Well, let's =
see how it goes.

I got a bunch of financial consultancy work on the  side.  I arrange financ=
ing for some people with our bank contacts.   It's very tedious and time co=
nsuming to complete a deal.  Sometimes, the  odds of getting a good deal ar=
e very slim that I can't really depend on these  things for regular income.=
  I can't spend that much anymore.  I'm  saving up for my future.  I may ac=
tually get married in a year or  two.  I don't know yet, but this relations=
hip is getting pretty serious and  I think that she's the one.  She's study=
ing medicine and will be graduating  this April.  She'll have another year =
of internship before taking the  boards next year.  She wants to go to the =
US for her residency, but we'll  see how things go.  Any good medical schoo=
ls/hospitals there in  Houston? =20

Well, I gotta go now.  Just write when you have  time.
