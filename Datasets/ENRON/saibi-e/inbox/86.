easons to Consider Buying SHCC  1. WeatherRadios.com has been awarded a Nat=
ional Partnership with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to in=
crease the use of Weather Radios countrywide through a program called Proje=
ct Impact. There are 2,600 Project Impact communities in the U.S. The FEMA =
website lists WeatherRadios.com as a national partner  providing a banner a=
nd link to the WeatherRadios.com site. The FEMA site receives over 100,000 =
visitors per day.  2.  The National Oceanic and Aerospace Administration (N=
OAA) has WeatherRadios.com listed first on their web site page that tells p=
eople where to purchase a NOAA Weather Radio.  3.  The National Weather Ser=
vice (NWS) has offered to promote corporate sponsorships to the WeatherRadi=
os.com site through  recognition and media support.  4.  Local American Red=
 Cross chapters will promote NOAA Weather Radios through WeatherRadios.com =
in exchange for a $5.00 donation per sold radio.  5.  The Chicago area AAA =
will feature SHCC's  2WayTalk.com on its website offering exclusive discoun=
ts on Weather Radios, and FRS Family Radios. 2WayTalk.com will also be  lis=
ted in the AAA magazine called "Home and Away".  6.  The Federation of Manu=
factured Home Owners of Florida (FMO) has entered into a one-year agreement=
 that will increase the sale of Weather Radios from the WeatherRadios.com s=
ite. Mailings and web site links will offer a group discount to members and=
 also pay a rebate to the organization for every radio sold.  7.  The Owner=
-Operator Independent Drivers Association (OOIDA) has begun to promote the =
discount that is offered  through WeatherRadios.com site. Magazine articles=
, mailings and web site links will offer a group discount to members and al=
so pay a rebate to the organization for every radio sold. This      agreeme=
nt will run for one year.  Why Weather Radios are Poised for Growth  NOAA W=
eather Radios automatically alert people of impending severe weather condit=
ions "24/7". This is especially critical for families while sleeping. These=
 devices are fast becoming recognized as essential and potentially life sav=
ing for use in homes, businesses, and critical care facilities.  The Nation=
al Weather Service (NWS) has stated that there has been an increase in seve=
re weather in the last 10 years and this trend is expected to continue. NWS=
 has a published goal for NOAA Weather Radios to be in every home within th=
e next 10 years. Currently, approximately just 7% of homes have this device=
. This being said, we can expect a tremendous increase in the presence and =
sale of weather radios over the coming years. The NWS, NOAA, the Federal Em=
ergency Management Agency (FEMA) and other government agencies have an aggr=
essive education and funding effort to reach the 100% goal.  New technology=
 called Specific Area Message Encoding (SAME) was introduced in the mid 90s=
. It allows users to set an alarm only for their specific geographic area. =
This feature is expected to make this tool commonplace in homes alerting fa=
milies of weather conditions that pose an immediate danger.   Additionally,=
 2WayTalk.com will continue to focus on Internet users who are outdoor enth=
usiasts. The market continues to be strong and growing. FRS Family Radios a=
re now becoming a popular family item on vacations, ski trips, camping, and=
 biking events. They are used for a wide variety of purposes, from staying =
in touch with children playing in the neighborhood, to coordinating soccer =
tournaments and antique auctions.   A Final Word About SHCC  SHCC is curren=
tly booking $45,000/ month and is conservatively projecting earnings next y=
ear of $1.3 million on revenues of $13 million. Unlike most e-commerce vent=
ures, ShareCom's marketing "burn rate" is very modest. The Company forecast=
s revenues of $32.5 million the following year, increasing profitability to=
 earn $4.6 million. Given its impressive relationships and the rapidly grow=
ing market for its product, SHCC's share price of just 1.6 cents makes it a=
 compelling play for the astute investor. =09
