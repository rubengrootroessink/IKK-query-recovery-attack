Eric,
 
You will not have to do anything....you will be using all of the equipment at Smith's desk.  I have ordered Smith the new equipment he will need.    I marked you down for vac and everything should be set up for you when you return.
 
Thanks Tjae

TJ, I am planning to take all of next week off as vacation.  However since I am on the hourly desk now, I don't really have any hardware or boxes that need to move.  I am assuming that they will put two new machines and several flat screens at the new desk, and set them up like the other traders.  Please let me know if this is not correct or if I need to do anything related to this move.  Thanks.
 
Eric
