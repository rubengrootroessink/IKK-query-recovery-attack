> Hello,
> My name is James Klatell, and I am a producer for CNN.  We are putting
together a story on Enron employees (former and current) who are selling
Enron merchandise.
> If you would like to tell your story, to tell people why you are
auctioning the book, I could set up an interview with our reporter in
Houston.
> You can reach me by e-mail at James.Klatell@turner.com, or by phone at
(404) 827-3497.

> Thank you.
