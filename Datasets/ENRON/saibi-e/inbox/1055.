Frontera is not scheduled to run tomorrow.   However all units should be available,  but offline with the following exception:

He 10 -  some gas line work is being done and Frontera can only run in a 1/1 config,   meaninig a max of 220.    The steamer, #3 and CT #1
will be the only units available.  For this hour.    

Late word:   If Ercot doesnt OOM us,   the entire plant will be unavailable and offline for he 1, as well.

In this scenario,  only hour ending 1 and 10 would be affected.


Any questions?
