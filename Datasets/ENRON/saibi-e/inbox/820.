ear on comprehensive energy legislation on Monday.  Senate Minority Leader =

  The big issue dividing the two parties is whether to open a portion of Al=
aska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling.  The vote is expect=
ed to take place at 5:00 ET on Monday and the Washington bureau will bring =
us the vote outcome as soon as it becomes available.   Peter says the burea=

reau will continue to bring us the very latest on Enron next week as the en=
