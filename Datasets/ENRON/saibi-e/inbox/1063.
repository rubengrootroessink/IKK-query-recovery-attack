Eric, 
Nice to hear back from you, and nice talking to you earlier.   
It seems like days ago that Adnan and I were hanging out in Saint Louis with  
nothing to do but drinking, smoking, and gambling.  (I did most of the smoking, and Khan the gambling).  But this December it will have been three years since we finished our college careers.  Where does the time go?
That's very interesting, Adnan never mentioned the gambling.  But it doesnt surprise me after seeing him in our last trip to Vegas. 
Sure I wouldn't mind hanging out with your friend if she is similarly 
inclined.  It can be a bit awkward at times being around so many people who 
you do not know, and I am by nature a quiet person.  I'm not looking for 
anything more than just good company.  As you may know I just broke up with 
my girlfriend of two years, and I'm just getting used to being on my own so 
to speak.
Yes, I totally understand.  Like I said, i'm not trying to play matchmaker, I just wanted both of you to have good company.  I know how you must feel.  In a way, I'm all of my friends' "councelor."  I'm the one they usually come to when they have relationship problems and need advice, or plainly vent.  So I know these past few weeks have probably not been easy for you... and all I can really tell you is that time and self realization will heal the pain.  We've all been there.  
Although I have every intention of attending your wedding, I should let you 
know that my father has been ill, and that there may be matters which might 
require my attention in San Francisco.  Hopefully, this will not be the 
case.  And if so I promise to make a trip out to visit both of you in the 
near future. 
Not a problem.  Family is always first.   
Like I was saying earlier... Friday night is when my best guy friend, Mike, was thinking of taking Adnan out with all the other guys.  Alllll the guys know that anything to do with stripping is out of the question.  So Mike suggested going out to a bar or something like that and just drinking, and do the "guy thing".  whatever that may be.  I thought maybe you could get in contact with him and see what you guys want to do.  But keep in mind, that the wedding rehearsal is the next morning (sat 12/01/01) at 11:30am.  So I need my fiance to be "okay" by that time :-)  
Here's mike's e-mail...

Make sure you tell him you're the best man, and you'll be coming in for the wedding on friday, and see what you guys can plan.  I know it will be hard since you're so far away, but Mike knows the ropes pretty well around here :-)  
So tell me something Adnan has probably not told me :-)  Like when he went out with "Juggles/Jiggles" and what he was like back when you guys were in college.  Did he tell you i almost went to Wash U?  I visited the campus w/ my dad back in august of 1996, and I loved it.  I had just returned from Europe that year, and I started to get into the groove of the whole college app thing, so my dad took me to see a bunch of places I might consider going to.  I got into Wash U, but I didn't go obviously... I always wonder... what if??  :-) 
Anyways... it's near my bed time, so I must depart.  I hope we can get to know each other a bit better within the next few weeks, and definitely into the future.

Talk to you soon,
