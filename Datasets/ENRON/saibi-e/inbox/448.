The position for Monday is currently scheduled into imbalance in both the QSE MOS and Enpower.
Make sure that both are modified when you make sales/purchases.


Attached are the spreadsheets that reflect what Frontera is doing for the next three days.   Again,  look to the top line to know what generation output should be.  

Know it,  learn it,   live it.

Thanks,

JMF
