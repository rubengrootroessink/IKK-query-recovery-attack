Thanks for the invitation.  I'll make sure that a trip to Houston will be
part of my itinerary when I go to the US.  I'm glad that Jennifer and you
are going out.  It's always never the same, but hopefully it will turn out
for the best.  I believe my girlfriend wants to be either a pediatrician or
a dermatologist.  I don't really know what she wants to do, but she'll be
taking the US MLE sometime next year.  I guess we'll have to see what
happens then.  I'll just write more soon.  We have a guest from Taiwan and
one from Australia that we have to entertain today.  It's gonna be one long
freaking day.

Cliff
