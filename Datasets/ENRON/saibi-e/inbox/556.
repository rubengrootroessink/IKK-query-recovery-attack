Hi!  I just got back from Germany!  It was a pleasant trip but things in
Frankfurt are just so expensive.  I went there for a distributor's meeting,
and had the opportunity to meet the people that we are having correspondence
with over fax and e-mail in the past.  Our account officer is a pretty girl
and she is only 23 years old.  The downside is that she is married for one
year already.  Oh well, life's tough.  I think one of the other distributors
noticed me flirting with this girl.  Well, a quarter of the way around the
world should be fair game.  Anyway, I was surprised that Frankfurt wasn't
that big of a city.  You can walk from the main parts of the city in a few
minutes.  Mostly, they only have Churches (every five blocks there seems to
be one), slaughterhouses, and castles.  In fact, they have been preserving
so many allegedly historical buildings.  These are ugly ass buildings that
have no apparent architectural appeal.  Due to this, the new European
Central Bank buildings has to be built at the back of one of these alleged
historical sites.  The building is long and takes up too much prime space
with no apparent purpose whatsoever.  This seems to be a prevalent site in
most of Frankfurt.  A pleasant surprise during my trip was that the company
paid for my hotel room.  I was prepared to pay for it, but I wasn't charged
when I checked-out.

Our meeting lasted from Monday to Thursday, which left Friday and Saturday
free for me before my flight on Sunday.  I decided to join a city tour by
bus to Rothenburg.  Well, I was initially set on going to Heidelberg but I
met this American Chinese girl who was travelling alone and I decided to
just accompany her to Rothenburg.  She works in Santa Clara for some upstart
IT company.  I told my girlfriend about it because nothing really happened
aside from us spending the whole of Friday and Saturday together.  Then
again, I am not sure what I would have told her if something did happen ;-)

I'm seriously thinking of taking my Masters in Finance here in the
University of the Philippines.  However, the application forms would only be
available every May and the exam would be in August.  It would be a one-year
course starting September, which would time my graduation right about when
Claudine finishes her local board exams.  I guess I don't see a bright
future here in the Philippines, and I may just follow her when she
specializes in the States or Canada.  Unless something drastic happens and
our country just progresses rapidly, or my stars change, I think that this
would be the plan that I would take.  I guess her petitioning me for a
Canadian citizenship would help a lot in getting a job in Canada or the US.
I'm pretty sure that the US economy would pick-up after two years.  You guys
never stay down!  My country is sinking because of the ever-divided people.
There is no unity and I would suggest for us to just divide the goddamn
country - one for the Muslims, one for the Chinese, and one for the Spanish
people - then we call it the Divided States of the Philippines!!!

Oh well, I'm just ranting right now.  Just write when you have the time.
Have you spoken to Khan lately?  Tell his ass to write me!  I haven't heard
from him for quite some time now.  I hope he is okay.  Send him my regards.
