 =09 =09    Dear Eric,  Former Enron CEO Kenneth Lay will not testify at ei=
ther Congressional hearing this week.  Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook s=
ays because of Lay's decision not to appear, the Senate Commerce Committee =
is expected to authorize the issuance of a subpoena to Lay as early as Tues=
day morning.  Two House subcommittees could soon issue their own subpoenas =
as well.  A subpoena would compel Lay to appear, but it does not guarantee =
he will testify - he could invoke his constitutional right not to speak.   =
Other hearings involving Enron will proceed as planned, with three hearings=
 scheduled for Tuesday morning.  One of the hearings involves Enron board m=
ember William Powers, who will testify in front of the House Energy and Com=
merce Committee's Oversight Subcommittee. Powers led the internal investiga=
tion at Enron, resulting in a report released this weekend that was highly =
critical of the company's management team.  We'll have highlights from Powe=
rs' testimony on Tuesday from Washington.   Unsecured creditors can help en=
sure a better rate of return on what they're owed by Enron through claims t=
rading.  That's according to Haynes and Boone LLP Attorney Lenny Parkins.  =
He'll join us during the noon ET newscast from the Houston bureau to discus=
s the process of claims trading and how creditors can assure they will rece=
ive some sort of payment.   Also from Houston on Tuesday, Williams Gas Pipe=
line CEO Doug Whisenant talks about pipeline safety following September 11.=
 He'll also discuss the future of Williams Gas Pipelines.   We'll have more=
