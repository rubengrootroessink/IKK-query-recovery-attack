Eric Saibi (Off-Peak Trader for ERCOT) wants to change the last line in all the off-peak products to read "Saturday or Sunday, or any day that is a NERC holiday" from "Saturday or Sunday,  including any day that is a NERC holiday".  Can you please run it by legal and have it changed???  If you have any questions please contact Eric or myself.

Thanks in advance 

Seung-Taek

You can let us know of the change and we will run it by Legal.  Also, a ticker will most likely have to be posted notifying customers of the change.
