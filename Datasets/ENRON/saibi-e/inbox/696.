The ST ercot book is long 30 mw's in the offpeak hours for Monday.    We would like to sell these mw's at a reasonable price that is left to your judgement.
If prices look to be potentially negative,  of course,  sell the mw's.

Give me a call if you have questions, preferrably before 10 pm.


Thanks,
JMF
