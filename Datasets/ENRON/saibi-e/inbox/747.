Dear Power Outage Database Customer,

Attached you will find an excel document. The outages contained within
are forced or rescheduled outages. Your daily delivery will still
contain these outages.

In addition to the two excel documents, there is a dbf file that is
formatted like your daily deliveries you receive nightly. This will
enable you to load the data into your regular database. Any questions
please let me know. Thanks.
