Hello everyone!

I hope you're all as excited as we are!  We're very
anxious to see everyone :-)

We have pondered the idea of the Bachelor/Bachelorette
party, and we both would rather have all our friends
together, rather than seperate.  So we hope you will
all join us on
Friday November 30th at 8:00 PM
655 Baker St. #BB103
Costa Mesa 92626
We will meet there, then carpool/tailgate to the Four
Seasons Hotel in Newport Beach for an evening of
drinks, desserts, and jazz.

Please reply and let us know you'll be coming.  We
hope to see everyone there!  :-)

Adnan & Maylynn
