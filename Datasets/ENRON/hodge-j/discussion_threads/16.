Here is the lastest and greatest...

I have added a second tab to the worksheet which sorts by pipeline (vs region 
and date).  Hope that helps you review this puppy.  We still have alot of 
blue dates out there, so please review those lines and let me know if those 
projects have come online or where delayed or killed.

Thanks,

Julie  :-)
