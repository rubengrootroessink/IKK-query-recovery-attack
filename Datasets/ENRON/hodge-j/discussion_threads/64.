Hi, John,

Following up my phone call, I am sending a list of curve requests for you on 
the BNY project:

Base Year: 2001

1. Trans Canada:
  Demand Charges
 Variable Charges
 Fuel Requirement 
 Estimation of Trariff escalation  
2. Iroquois:
  Demand Charges
 Variable Charges
 Fuel Requirement 
 Estimation of Trariff escalation 
 3. Transco Z1 - Z6:
  Demand Charges
 Variable Charges
 Fuel Requirement 
 Estimation of Trariff escalation  

On the Tariff escalation part, based on your inputs, we used 22%, 18%, and 
36% of GDP inflation for TransCanada, Iroquois and Transco, respectively.  
Also, you estimated % increase in Transco Tariff from 2001 to 2007.  

Thanks a lot for your help!
