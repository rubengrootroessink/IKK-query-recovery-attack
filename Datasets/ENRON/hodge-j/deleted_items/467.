Carol:

	I am looking at some payment netting documents, but not master netting agreements.  Why don't you send me the letter you received and I can figure out the direction to take?

Thanks,

Jeff

Frank or Steve:
Are either of you handling a MNA with Carolina Power & Light Company, Florida Power Corporation and North Carolina Natural Gas Corporation ?  We just received a letter from Progress Energy (their parent?) and sounds like they are anxious to reach closure on a MNA.
