Jeffrey:

The AEP fax number is +44 207 659 4104, attention
Linda Pszon.  Also, if it could be faxed to the
attention of Surinder Toor, also of AEP, +44
1923857920.

The certificate can be sent by courier to:

AEP Energy Services
6th Floor
50 Berleley Street
London W1J 8 AP

I think that was all you needed?  Also, if you
wouldn't mind (have I asked for enough favors from you
yet?) sending me notice by e-mail that the document is
being circulated to the buyer.

Thanks,

Matt
