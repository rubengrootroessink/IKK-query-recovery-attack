Mary, Tom Callaghan at the EEOS would be the business Point of Contact.  Claudia Santos may be able to help you on the Secretarial related documents as I recall recently these may have been transferred to us.  I have Marty's old legal files on OEC.

Dear Randy:  Please tell me who in your group may have the working files for these companies so we can ask them to update the list of officers and to advise Corp. Sec. which attorney and/or paralegal will be responsible for these entities.

Many thanks,

Re:	OEC Mexico Operations LLC
	OEC Mexico S. de R.L. de C.V.
	OEC Services S. de R.L. de C.V.

Wyndi McNamara of EEOS informed me that the above companies are now with EWS-ENA.  Would you confirm this, and are you the designated keeper of these entities?  If so, I'll update the database and our records.

Also, if they are with ENA, please confirm specifically which group within ENA (i.e., EWS-ENA, or EWS-Mexico).  Also, if you know the designated lawyer in your group for these companies, I'll take that info too.

All of course, if you know.

Thanks Mary.
