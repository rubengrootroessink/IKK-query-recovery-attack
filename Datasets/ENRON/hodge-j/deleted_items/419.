Please review the attach and if allright let's print on Enron North America letterhead and send back to Byron and Phil for signature.

Dan

Gentlemen- In the interest of time, we took the initiative and redid the
consent to assignment sent by Dan Hyvl back in May to bring it current.  If
this works for you, it will work for us.  Let us know.
