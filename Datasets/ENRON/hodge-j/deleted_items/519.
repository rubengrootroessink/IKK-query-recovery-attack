Lindsay:

	I have looked at the material and it seems backwards to me.  I think that instead of ENA being assigned the contract between NDR and MichCon that MichCon should be assigned the supply contract between NDR and ENA.  In other words, ENA should not step into the shoes of NDR, MichCon should.

	Also, I have attached a copy of our sample Master Agreement.

Thanks,

Jeff

Please review.  Also, if you could send an electronic copy of our master enfolio agreement, I would greatly appreciate it.
Thanks.
