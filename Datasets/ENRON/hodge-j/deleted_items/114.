Gary, actually I have not heard back from Guadelupe Power Partners yet.  I
just wanted to let you know that a meeting was planned for Monday or Tuesday

Thanks,

Jim, I talked with Janet late yesterday and she wanted me to pass along
that the meeting will be on Monday and 10:00 am. You may want to send
out a meeting notice to get it on everyone's calendar.
