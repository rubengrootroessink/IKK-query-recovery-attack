Dear Carlos:  Please consider the following questions:

Re the automotive gas sales LLC in Mexico, do you know if the Mexico group still plans to form an SRL for that purpose?  If not, perhaps we can delete or cancel the Delaware LLC that was set up to co-own it (the SRL) with a Dutch BV.  This LLC is one Kate Cole was asking about recently because I never did finalize the LLC agreement since the need for this LLC's existence was called into question right after we formed it.  

Re the Baja LLC and SRL set up for the FAPSA deal.  How is that deal progressing?  Will the companies be used?  If so, I need to change the officers and directors and I need your advice on which people in the company would be best in those capacities.  

How about all the Desarrolladoras de Predios SRLs set up to do real estate deals?  Where is the group headed with that?  Do we want to continue to maintain these companies?

Please advise, and thanks,
Mary
