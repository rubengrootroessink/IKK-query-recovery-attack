We are concerned re the Gas Supply Agreement - I did not think we assigned the Gas Supply Agreement to OEV.

We assigned the agreement to Onondaga Energy Venture some time ago, so I would presume that matters pertaining to ENA no longer apply. Any thoughts on this? Also, if ENA still applies, I would presume ENA's bankruptcy filing would protect against any such termination.
