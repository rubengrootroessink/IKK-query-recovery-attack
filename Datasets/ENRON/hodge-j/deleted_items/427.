That is correct.  The buyout value from the desk as of 10/26/01 was $810,000.  This was determined by PV'ing the value of the remaining monthly demand charges owed to ENA from November 2001 through the end of the GSA (6/30/08).  The nominal value of each monthly demand charge is approximately $11,500.

Call me if you have any questions.

My statement on the value of the GSA is based on the extensive work that Fred, John and I have done on this deal. Fred previously checked with the gas desk on this because Aquila had indicated an interest to buy out this contract. The gas desk indicated the current value (as of a couple weeks ago) was $800k. Fred, please confirm.

Thanks,
