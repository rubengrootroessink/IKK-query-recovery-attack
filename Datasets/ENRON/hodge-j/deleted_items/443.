INTERNATIONAL FORUM 2002:  THE INTERNATIONAL CARTEL WORKSHOP 
JANUARY 31 - FEBRUARY 1, 2002 
THE PLAZA, NEW YORK 
The Section of Antitrust Law is pleased to invite you to our International Forum 2002:  The conference is a full two-day conference featuring enforcement officials from the United States, Canada, the European Commission, the United Kingdom and Australia, defense lawyers from six jurisdictions and plaintiffs lawyers from major cartel cases in the United States.  
The conference will be based on a hypothetical cartel case and will be conducted as demonstrations of various events in a major cartel case in several jurisdictions.  The first day's lunch will feature an enforcement roundtable with representatives of five jurisdictions discussing cartel enforcement and the second day's lunch will present a judicial roundtable featuring judges who have presided in cartel cases, civil and criminal.
For complete conference information click on this link http://www.abanet.org/antitrust/cartelagenda.pdf  or contact the Section of Antitrust at 312.988.5609. 
The brochure has been mailed and will be delivered shortly.
