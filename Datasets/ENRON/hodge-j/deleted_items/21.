                 COLUMBIA GULF TRANSMISSION COMPANY
                  NOTICE TO ALL INTERESTED PARTIES
                        JANUARY 19, 2001


SUBJECT:  NOTICE TO PARTIES DELIVERING OR CAUSING GAS TO BE DELIVERED TO
   COLUMBIA GULF TRANSMISSION COMPANY

Pursuant to Section 25.2(a) of Columbia's tariff, Columbia is providing notice
of the imposition of the following additional gas quality specification on all
shippers, interconnecting pipelines, producers, and receipt meter operators,
and all other parties delivering or causing gas to be delivered into Columbia's
system:

     All gas tendered under Columbia's tariff shall have a gross heating value
    of no more than 1050 Btu per cubic foot.

This additional gas quality specification will be imposed two (2) business days
after this notice is posted on Columbia's internet electronic bulletin board.


In addition to complying with this additional gas quality specification, all
parties delivering or causing gas to be delivered into the Columbia-operated
Blue Water system on the Western Shoreline, the Southwestern Extension, or on
the Header (west of the system null point) may be required to provide evidence
to Columbia that such gas is being processed at the Blue Water Processing Plant
to ensure that the composite gas stream at Egan, Louisiana has a gross heating
value of 1050 Btu or less.  Evidence of the gas processing agreements may be
required upon Columbia's request.

Failure of a party to comply with the additional gas quality specification set
forth above and to provide Columbia Gulf with evidence, upon request, of a gas
processing agreement for gas delivered to the Blue Water system will result in
Columbia Gulf refusing to accept gas from such party and to make corresponding
redeliveries.

Imposition of this additional gas quality specification does not relieve any
party delivering gas or causing gas to be delivered to Columbia's system from
its existing obligations to comply with the gas quality specifications set
forth in Section 25.1 of Columbia's tariff, to ensure the merchantability of
the gas, and to ensure that gas has been properly processed before entering
Columbia's system.

Columbia, pursuant to the terms of Section 25.2(a) of its tariff, is imposing
this additional gas quality specification as it has determined, in its
reasonable judgment, that harm to its pipeline system and its operations may
occur if it receives gas on its system that fails to meet this additional gas
quality specification.  Columbia reserves the right to revise this additional
gas quality specification upon further analysis of the gas that is being
received by Columbia and reevaluation of the potential harm to Columbia's
pipeline system and its operations.

You are further placed on notice that Columbia will hold you responsible and
seek legal redress for any damages it incurs as a result of the higher Btu
gas.

Any questions about this notice may be directed to Gary Espey, (713) 267-4761,
or to John Pillion, (713) 267-4764.
