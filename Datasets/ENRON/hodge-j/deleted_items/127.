Jeff,

I've spoken with Melissa, and they have finally realized that the Enfolio in question was not on the Exhibit of the sale documents (HPL to AEP).  Since it is an intercompany contract, as you pointed out, it should never have been an issue.  In the meantime, Dan Hyvl sent a GISB to your attention, and until it is finalized we will continue to put deals on GTCs.
Call me if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Susan

Susan:

	Sorry for the delay in response.  You can go ahead and call Melissa.  Let her know our position and find out what attorney we should call over there to make the change.  

Thanks,

Jeff

Jeff,

Thanks for looking into this and getting back to me so quickly.  Will you be handling this going forward, or will another attorney?  Do you want me to call Melissa Graves and tell her what you told me, or is that someone else's responsibility?  At the very least, I would like to tell her that someone will be in contact with AEP's legal department.

Thanks,
Susan
