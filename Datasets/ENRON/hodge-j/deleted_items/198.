Ladies and Gentlemen:  The subject invoice was sent to Accts. Payable at En=
ron on Oct. 10.  I received a call on Oct. 16 from somebody in Accts. Payab=
le asking for clarification re the payee, which I provided.  Since then the=
 invoice has not appeared in ipayit.  I called the help desk today at x5472=
7 and the woman I spoke with said that since there was nothing in "the syst=
em" with the invoice number in it, there was no way to check the status of =
my payment request. I was told that the only way to ensure payment was to s=
end it to A/P again.  The woman I spoke with suggested I prepare an emergen=
cy payment request, if that was necessary.  I will now do this, since I hav=
e no faith in the system as you've set it up. =20

Is there a way you could cross-reference these items or find a way to keep =
these bills from getting lost?  It's very frustrating to have to keep re-se=
nding invoices for payment when there seems to be no accountability for ite=
ms that disappear into "the system."    I

Another problem that I encountered with ipayit with another invoice for thi=
s vendor occurred just last month.  What happened was that even though I'd =
marked the invoice for special handling when I coded it in ipayit, it was n=
ot sent to me but instead went out in the U.S. mail from New York.  I was u=
pset to learn that there seemed to be no way of finding out if the check, w=
hich was addressed to an incomplete address in Mexico City, Mexico, even ha=
d enough postage on it for a foreign address or whether it had been returne=
d to sender.  They couldn't even tell me what the return address was that w=
ould have appeared on the envelope so I could see if the check had been ret=
urned before Enron cancelled it and asked for it to be re-issued.  What was=
 even more interesting to me was that the person at the help desk didn't ev=
en seem to care what the address was or whether or not there was a system i=
n place to retrieve returned checks so that the client could make sure they=
 were properly forwarded to the payee.   =20

What frustrates me is the total lack of accountability with your current se=
t-up.  There is no way to follow-up on requests.  The burden is solely on t=
he bill sender, with people on the paying end simply stating that we should=
 "run it through again" with no guarantee that the invoice will be processe=
d a second time, either.  In my case, if I'd known how important it was and=
 that the burden of proof would be on me to get my invoice processed, I'd h=
ave written down the name of the person I spoke with in A/P (though I'm not=
 sure that they even gave it to me nor that it would help me to know that n=
ow in any case) that called me on Oct. 16.  Since I did not, I have no reco=
urse, since "the system" doesn't show my invoice as having been received.

I'm certain that it is Enron's policy to pay bills on time.  Why do you set=
 up systems that make our job so difficult and force us to follow-up on so =
many routine requests?  I'd prefer to not have to do an urgent payment requ=
est for all the bills that I'm responsible for paying, but it seems that's =
the only way to make sure many invoices are paid.

Please let me know what solutions we can expect for problems such as this. =
