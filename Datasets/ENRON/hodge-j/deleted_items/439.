Jeff, sorry to be a nag - any luck with the Arcos resolutions?

Two more matters:

1) we are trying to sell the Norway business by the end of the week (to yield some USD 2.2 million and hopefully five times that for the book) - I'll call you later but we'll need another resolution and PoA for Eric for that - it goes to the Creditor's committee today

2) we have a lot of smaller issues with contracts, close-out etc here and NO officer of ECTRIC or ECT Europe Inc. left! I would like to make Eric Shaw an officer of these companies very urgently so we do not continue to bleed value (he so far refuses to become a director which would be the best solution)
