I had your consent document signed by Enron and I faxed and Emailed back to you with fax also to Dan Hyvl.  Please be on the lookout and let me know if you need anything else.  

Thanks

Gentlemen- In the interest of time, we took the initiative and redid the
consent to assignment sent by Dan Hyvl back in May to bring it current.  If
this works for you, it will work for us.  Let us know.
