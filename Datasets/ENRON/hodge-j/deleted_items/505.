Paul,

Any joy with the ECTRIC board minutes yet? Can you confirm as a matter of
urgency whether they have been signed yet and if not whether there is a
substantive issue here.

I also attach our comments on the master netting agreement. I trust that
most of the points raised are self explanatory. However please note that we
are still considering whether ECTRIC should be a party to this agreement and
whether we can accomodate clause 7 (Non default payment netting).
