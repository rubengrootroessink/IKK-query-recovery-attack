My statement on the value of the GSA is based on the extensive work that Fred, John and I have done on this deal. Fred previously checked with the gas desk on this because Aquila had indicated an interest to buy out this contract. The gas desk indicated the current value (as of a couple weeks ago) was $800k. Fred, please confirm.

Thanks,
