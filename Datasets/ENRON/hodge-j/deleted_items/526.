Jeff,

I am sending you the DOE application that we need to file.  It includes a Certificate of Counsel which you have previously signed.  If you could do so again, I'll get it filed this week.  You can send it up to Rubena Buerger on the 47th floor and she will Fed Ex it to me along with the filing fee check.  She expects to be sending the check on Wed.  Thanks.
