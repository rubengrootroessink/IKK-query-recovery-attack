Clement:

Attached to the e-mail I am forwarding you will find the Enron Guaranty 
Agreement that was forwarded to Altrade.  Could you review the comments of 
Altrade and respond.  Also, I presume that Enron has provided a Guaranty to 
Altrade for ENA's business.  You may well wish to use that as a starting 
point.

Thanks,

Jeff

I recently received Altrade's comments to the joint guarantee from Enron and 
Peoples on behalf of Enovate.
I would appreciate it if you can review the comments, so that we can provide 
them with some feedback.

Thanks
