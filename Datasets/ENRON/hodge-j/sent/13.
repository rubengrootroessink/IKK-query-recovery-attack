Does this work for you?  By copy of this note I am asking Dan to call you to 
verify.

Robert,
 I confirmed with the Transportation Desk that the designation "TETCO M3" is 
a zone designation that includes all points within the zone.  Therefore the 
language "and all downstream delivery on the M3" is not needed.  Please call 
if you have any questions.

Hi Stacy -

Dick Jenkins has expressed concern with the description of an EnronOnline 
location and wants an immediate revision.  The location description needing 
revision is the TETCO M3.  It is currently defined as follows:

The transaction is for delivery at Texas Eastern Transmission Corp. - Zone M3.


Dick wants to ensure that the delivery shall also include any location on the 
M3.  Therefore, please advise as follows:

The transaction is for delivery at Texas Eastern Transmission Corp. - Zone 
M3, and all downstream delivery on the M3.  

We need to get a ticker item posted on the website as soon as possible.  

Thanks -

Rob
