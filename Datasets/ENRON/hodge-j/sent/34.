Jeff, 

Attached is the latest Palo Alto document with their red lined comments.  I 
haven't had a chance to look at them yet but will right now.  

Thanks,

Kim

Monica and Karla:

The attached draft Natural Gas Services Agreement contains the remainder of
my suggested revisions to the document, beginning with Article 12 (where I
stopped renumbering!).  There are no additional changes to the redlined
portion of the draft (Articles 1 thru 9) I sent yesterday.


Let me know as soon as you find out about the time scheduled for the
conference call with Enron.
Thanks.
