Michael:

It is circulating.  I really do not have any idea as to time frame.

Hello Jeff - I'm not chasing at all, but wondered when the Unanimous Consent 
might have been finalised - as you can see it won't delay the 
recapitalization process but will be needed in due course for registration. I 
promised I would let local counsel know a likely timeframe.
Many thanks for your help.

Michael

Michael
apparently the notary is not going to raise problems but he is not going to
register the deed in his books until he receives the original of the proxy
(the unanimous consent can be attached to it later although it will be
mentioned in the deed).
When do you think the courier will be here?
Regards,

Piero
