Jim:

I agree.  However, it probably would make some sense to have EWS legal look 
at any particularly complex pricing structures that may be passed by the EWS 
desk.

We  have not discussed EWS involvement in Term Sheets.  I would think 
contract review would be enough (do you really want mor things to review?),  
but will defer to your judgement.

Would ENA need to review at the term sheet stage?

I am reviewing the below term sheet tonight and we are discussing internally 
tomorrow at 8:00 am with a view to turning to customer by noon. I will review 
the commodity portion to see if I have questions for you.  Do you want 
someone in commodity to take a look as well?
