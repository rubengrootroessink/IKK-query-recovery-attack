Mr. Hodge,
?
??? I spoke briefly with Profs  Shipman and Whaley.? Of course, they always 
like to hear from former  students so I've included their relevant 
information.? Prof. Shipman,  surprisingly, does not use e-mail, so I have 
a?telephone number.? If  they're interested, may I provide them with 
the?information from your  business card??
