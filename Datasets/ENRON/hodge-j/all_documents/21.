John
As discussed on Monday, Enron Canada has agreed to restructure its "Boston 
Gas" agreements with Encal Energy so that Encal will become the shipper of 
record for a portion of the TGP and Iroquois capacity.  They in turn  will 
release back  to ENA for one year each April.  There should be no disruption 
to the East Desk business other than they will have additional contracts to 
manage for the same net volume.

These are the precise releases we would like you to initiate.  What we need 
to know as soon as possible is what if any credit requirements from Encal 
that the pipelines will require.
