Jim,
Thanks for response. I'll probably have a few more questions once I digest 
all the info that you provided.
Regards, Darrell

Excuse me, thats 97.8% of the days that were greater than 516 psig.

Darrell,  Attached is a history (last 365 days) of the suction pressures of 
Station 20 arranged in descending order.  In a nutshell, we looked at the 
minimum pressure (492 psig), calculated the pressure drop (34# at 54.4 
MMcf/d) on the proposed 6.6 miles of 12" to get 458 psig at the upstream side 
of the regulator.  Typically we would like to have a 50# differental across 
the regulator, which would give us 408 psig downstream of regulation.  I 
believe you were needing 435 psig.

 

Looking at the it in reverse, 435 psig + 50 psig across reg =  485 psig, 
calculate pressure drop (31 psig), we would need 516 psig at the suction of 
Station 20.  Note there are only 8 days during the last year where the 
pressure was lower than 516 psig or 97.8% of the time.

Please call me if you would like to discuss further or would like to meet.
