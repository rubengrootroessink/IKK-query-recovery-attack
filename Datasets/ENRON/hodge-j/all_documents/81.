Ooooo-k-aaaaaaay!  If nobody else steps up and asks for them, I'll keep the 
report in our files.....................as long as I have file space.  One of 
these days, they're going to move us into a tiny space like you guys have and 
then we'll be reduced to getting barely legible copies off RIMS!

Sounds like something we should keep, 
but..........................................................with my physical 
space limited to something less than the preceding dots, I'm not sure I have 
anywhere to put the maps.

Subject: Gulfstream Maps

Do you know anyone who would like or need detailed maps from the Final 
Environmental Impact Statement for Gulfstream?  I typically don't keep 
environmental information for projects because it takes up so much room and 
nobody ever asks for it.  However, this does have facility location maps of 
the project and various alternatives.  The full system is broken down into 
121 topographic maps, so it's very detailed.  This may not be the final 
routing, but it will be pretty close.

First come, first served.  I only have one volume.
