See attached.  It turns out Houston does not provide c/p identifications to 
Inside FERC.

Jeff, many thanks.  Peter.

Peter:

Attached you will find a sample of what ENA submits to Inside FERC.  As you 
can see, it is a download from EOL and does not include counterparty names.

I trust this is of some help to you in your current situation.

Jeff
