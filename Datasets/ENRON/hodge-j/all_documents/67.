Good morning.  I received a call from the Chair's office requesting an 
electronic copy of our customer lists and coverage assignments.  Good thing 
that we have been working on that this week.  In addition they want to meet 
with Scott and me this week on Budget issues.  To that end, it is important 
that we are ready to address several things at today's staff meeting.

Completed, electronic customer lists and coverage assignments.  Because of 
the potential overlap with Fred's group, it is important that the "Producer" 
list be complete.  If the Producer does not show on our list it will, by 
default be covered by Fred's activity.
From each group- Detailed write ups on a) Key market strategies b) Key 
Products c) Regulatory strategy.  How are you going to make your budget ?


See you are 3:00

Frank
