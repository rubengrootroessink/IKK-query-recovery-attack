Subject: Iroquois Gas Transmission's Eastchester Expansion

Iroquois has shuffled their customer base for the expansion into New York 
City beginning in November 2002.  The following customers have executed 
binding Precedent Agreements for 10 year contracts that would require a 
buy-out if the shipper tried to exit:

     Volume

Con Ed       30,000 Dthd
Keyspan Ravenswood     60,000
Mirant Corporation     60,000
Orion Power      60,000
Virginia Power Energy Marketing   20,000

Total     230,000 Dthd

Iroquois has changed their interconnect with Con Ed to the Throgs Neck 
section of the Bronx along the East River.  They are also starting to plan an 
expansion of the Eastchester project that will increase deliveries by 100,000 
to 200,000 Dthd beginning in the 2004-2005 time frame.  This expansion is 
timed similar to the recently announced plans by Duke/Keyspan and El Paso for 
projects into Long Island.  Iroquois is targeting NYPA, NRG and other 
announced merchant plants.
