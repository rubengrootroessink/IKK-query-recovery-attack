Attached is a memo regarding my discussions with OGE and the revised Master 
and GISB agreements.

 - GISB Spec Prov - enovate L.L.C..doc

I am also including their comments to our form of guarantee (they have no 
revisions other than entity and amount) and their proposed form of guarantee.

 - Enron Guaranty (from Master).doc - to enovate, llc.doc

Let me know what you think.

Thanks - Gregg
