Tammi,

I called Southern Co and they are working on what a demand charge they would 
like to provide 10 day peaking service.  They mentioned that they looked at 
it last year and the price they were being offered was less than if they 
released the capacity as baseload for the entire year (which they did).  

John, can you find out what they did the release for?

So Co will be back at us next week.
