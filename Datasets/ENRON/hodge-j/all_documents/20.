Think you're really funny?  Then show us!  Enter the latest Enron Business 
Top 10 contest and let us know what you think Enron's New Year's resolutions 
should be.  (We'll choose ten winners, so only one resolution per person, 
please.)  There may not be flashing lights and balloon drops if you win, but 
you will get your name published and a $25 gift certificate to the Signature 
Shop!

Enter the Enron Business Top 10 contest in the print publication or through 
the online version (go to home.enron.com, click on Publications, then on 
Enron Business and Volume 6, 2000).  Deadline is Friday, January 19.

Good luck!
