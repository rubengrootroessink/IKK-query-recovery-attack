I have a few questions regarding the capacity RFP you have forwarded for the 
FTNT, NIPPS, Transco Southeast Expansion FT, Transco FT and Transco Sunbelt 
FT capacity:

Package #1 - FTNT
What is the MDQ's of the upstream contracts?
Any restrictions on secondary deliveries?
Any implications for using on secondary basis?
284 or 7C?
Primary receipt and delivery points (Meter # or description) for each segment 
of capacity?
Any discounts on commodity or fuel?

Package #2, 3, 5, 6, 7 - Same questions as above except #5

Please advise.

Thanks.
