Subject: Exchange with CGAS

John/Scott/Chris,
Please create a park and lend(synthetic storage) transport tkt in Sitara to 
capture the exchange we did with Cgas so we can schedule in Unify.  We park 
310,000 in March and get back in August of 2001.  John Hodge has associated 
costs. I believe the contracts are contract #'s 67300 and 67304.

The sitara tkts for the exchange are 655097 abnd 655096.  We will cover costs 
and be able to pay CGAS bills associated with this transaction once the 
transport cap. tkt is created in Sitara.  No need to create unnecessary CPR 
pipeline exchange tkts.
If you have questions let me know.
