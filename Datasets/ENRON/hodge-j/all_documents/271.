Subject: PG&E WMBE Transaction

In addition to our direct exposure with PG&E Core, ENA has one outstanding 
WMBE transaction with the counteraprty:

Nine Energy Services, LLC - Total Sale of 11,000 mmbtu ($238,000)

I have notified the trader and the WMBE Counterparty we can not do any 
further business with PG&E under this process.

Russell
