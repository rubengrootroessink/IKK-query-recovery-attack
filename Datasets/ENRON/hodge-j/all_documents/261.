Jeff - attached are PG&E's comments to the Enron guarantee associated with 
the 10 day call transaction.  The revisions don't appear to be significant to 
me, but I obviously defer to your judgement.  Let me know what you think.

Thanks - Gregg

Roy, attached are the proposed guarantee formats as reviewed by our
attorney.  Please review and comment directly to Tanya Murphy, our attorney.
Although one of the guarantees states $1MM, I am still trying to get a firm
amount considering the fluctuations in prices and ensuring the March 31
termination date is OK.

We appreciate hearing from you very soon.
