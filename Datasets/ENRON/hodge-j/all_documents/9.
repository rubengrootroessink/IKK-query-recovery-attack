Tom - Thanks for the update. Most definitely would like copies of everything! 

I understand that there have been internal meetings with GPG. What is the 
status of their involvement?

We can make an assessment of feasibility after we have had time to digest the 
information.  Any feedback from Bobby Rowan on the list of questions I sent  
a couple of months ago?

Subject: Power Alley

Folks:

I have the University of Georgia Study that explains the Power Alley 
concept.  For those of you who do not know what I am referring to, the 
Governor of Georgia, Roy Barnes, wants to develop an economic development 
zone right through the middle of the state.  In order to do this he intends 
to upgrade or build new infrastructure including roads, railroads, fiber 
optics, and a 24'' natural gas pipeline.  There are definite holes in the 
proposal, but I thought that you all might be interested.  If you are 
interested in receiving a copy, let me know.  If you know of others who 
should receive a copy, keep me posted.

The executive summary is only about 20 pages, and I could have copies in the 
mail today.  The rest of the study involves 200 pages, and if you would like 
a copy of that information, I could get it to you sometime after the first of 
the year.

I also would be interested in your comments about what needs to be done for 
this infrastructure to be of worth.  For example, it is clear to me that in 
order for the pipeline to be valuable, it needs to be tied into other pipes.  
It is not clear which pipes or where.  Second, it is clear that if they 
expect generation to be built, they will need upgraded transmission and 
possibly a bigger pipeline, 30'' (depending on demand).

Please give me some feedback.  I would like to provide some sort of 
constructive feedback to those presenting the information.  I have been 
working with some of the primary movers on this piece of work, and I would 
like to see the project completed.

Thanks.

Tom Chapman
