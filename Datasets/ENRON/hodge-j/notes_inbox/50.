Jeff:

We don't have provisions in a physical contract requiring posting collateral, 
do we?

Teresa,

Two quick questions - first, where will the rehypothecation procedures with 
regard to Stoneville be documented (between Stoneville and Enron)?  Second, 
why did the "Interest Rate" definition in the Margin Agreement Amendment 
change from a Libor-based number to a Fed Funds-based number?  Thanks again 
and let me know.

Mike

Attached is an Amendment to the most recent Margin Agreement that is being

Thanks.

Teresa,

Attached please find clean and blacklined drafts of the main documents.
Augie and I have talked with Milbank and plan to send them drafts of these
documents tomorrow, but we wanted to give you a chance to review them first.
Please feel free to call or e-mail us with any questions or comments.

Warm regards,
