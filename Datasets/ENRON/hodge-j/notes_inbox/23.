Jeff, Bill,

I received a call today from Elsa Villareal on the Texas Desk and confirmed 
with OGE's credit that due to the weather, wells have been shut in in 
Oklahoma and they are calling Force Majore on one of their Interruptable 
contracts to ENA (Sitara #495794).  I have been assured by OGE all firm gas 
transactions will continue to flow, only this one transaction will be 
effected.  The transaction calls for 15,000 mmbtu/day and is being cut down 
to 7,500/day through Saturday. 

Russell
