How are you/maybe one day the OSU football coach will know how to deal with 
that team from the north!  I'm in a group at ees that is gradually 
progressing towards a contract briefing system; once we decide on the 
software and system ( i went to a global contract presentation which didn't 
bring back only bad memories!).  I know that we will end up with a similar 
document to what was used (and is still used i believe) in ENA with some 
differences due to the disparate types of customers.   Do you have a word 
version (even an older document would be fine) of that template?   I 
understand that now the ENA briefing system is 'online'.
