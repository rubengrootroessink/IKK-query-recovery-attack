Well, I am pleased to report that we have our first counterparty that is 
willing to sign both the enovate Master and GISB as is.  Jeff - I will 
overnight the duplicate originals provided by Oneok to your attention.  Would 
you please initial the signature lines and have your assistant return them to 
me?  I will get Laura's signature and forward them on to Oneok.

Thanks - Gregg
