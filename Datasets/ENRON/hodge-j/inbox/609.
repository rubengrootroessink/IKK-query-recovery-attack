Alliance has a prospective customer behind Columbia Gas of Virginia Op 10 Market Area 31 who is looking for a Dec01-Oct02 firm deliveries to their gate Nymex plus applicable basis quote.  I expect this customer to make a decision by early next week.  I am hoping to receive quotes back on this customer by tomorrow afternoon.  I would appreciate your help and time in advance.


Sincerely,
