I just got off the phone with Darren Vanek.  We have been talking  about what is needed for about a month now.  Almost two weeks ago he said  he wanted a contract that allowed him to call for a letter of credit if one were  needed in the future and that would suffice.
 
Apparently, a paralegal, is involved in generating such a contract and she  was out all of last week.  Darren said that he has no control over when the  contract actually gets sent to me.  Please do what you can to expedite the  emailing of that contract to me so that I can order gas beyond Dec. 2001.
 
Thanks and regards,
 
Dick Bryan
