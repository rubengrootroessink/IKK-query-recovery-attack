John,
Just a reminder that Tiger is still looking to baseload a piece of gas
delivered to WGL, on a firm basis, for the remainder of November.  We
are prepared to pay a premium above where Transco NNY prices are trading
right now (as of 11:15 a.m. on Nov. 5).  We would be looking to do a
volume of between 3,000-5,000/day.

If we do finalize a deal, we will either post an LC with you, or prepay
the entire amount by wire.

Thanks for you help,


Todd Campbell
