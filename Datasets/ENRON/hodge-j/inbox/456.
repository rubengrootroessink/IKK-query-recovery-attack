Jeff,

Lisa called me today regarding this matter.  I suggested she send you an e-mail with this request.  I am not sure who your legal assistant is now, but if you need my help, just let me know.

Kathleen

please add Fred Lagrasta Vice President for signature authority for ENA Upstream Company, LLC  effective immediately.

This is pursuant to the restructuring of ENA UPstream and producer wellhead groups sent in a memo to ENA employees 10/24.

If you have any questions or comments, please let me know.  lisa  5 4766
