To All:
Attached is the list of Enron entities and Hess entities to be included in the Master Collateral/Netting Agreement. 

Jeff- Can we please prepare 2 Enfolios, one for Amerada Hess Corp. and Hess Energy Trading Company, LLC. The Cross Default amounts in each contract should be $100 MM for ENA and the respective Hess entity. The collateral and MAC provisions will be contained in the Master Netting Agreement.

Frank- Please include Hess Energy Trading Company UK Limited, as agents for Hess Energy Trading Company, LLC  in the Master Netting Agreement. The proposed Power of Attorney for this entity was sent to you earlier today.

Thank you all for the help and please call if you have any questions.
-Darren
