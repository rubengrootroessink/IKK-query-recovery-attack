Dear Ann, 
Please note that Morgan Stanley has not signed the natgas master agreement referenced in the Amendment Agreement.  We are currently in the process of negotiating a GISB Master Agreement with Enron North America Corp. with Jeff Hodge.  In addition, it is Morgan Stanley's policy to be the confirming party. 
Let me know if you have any questions. 
Kind Regards, 
Dan
