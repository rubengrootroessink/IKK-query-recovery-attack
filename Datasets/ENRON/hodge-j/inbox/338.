	   John,
   Do you think you we be able to submit a quote for the facility behind
   COH 5 2  and/or the facility behind COH 7 3.  I am hoping to have all
   responses in by tomorrow morning and then, make a decision.  I hope to
   hear from you soon.  Also, if you did not receive the load profiles on
   these two facilities, I have attached them below.  Reminder:  They are
   looking for firm supply to the gate at a NYMEX based price.







	   Thanks,
