Jeff:

I realize that there is nothing anyone can say right now that can improve t=
he situation, but I can only imagine what you have been through the past fe=
w weeks as the Company virtually went into a financial free fall.  While I =
think the Dynegy deal was the only real alternative that we had to work wit=
h under the exigent circumstances at hand, I can imagine how painful this w=
hole thing must be for you in light of your longevity with the Company and =
everything you have built there from a professional standpoint.  It almost =
has seemed surreal each day watching the Company's financial condition dete=
riorate so suddenly; as I watched everyday's new developments, I kept refle=
cting on the fact that it was only a bit more than a month ago that you and=
 I were speaking with one another at the EWS Legal Conference with virtuall=
y no hint of what was to come.  Although we have not worked directly togeth=
er much over the past few years, I feel like I know you pretty well "throug=
h" all of the many EWS lawyers that I work with and frequently "bumping" in=
to you in the hallways "on 38".  It always has been fairly apparent to me h=
ow much effort, thought and sweat equity you have put into EWS and the EWS =
legal group and I have always considered you one of the pillars of the EWS =
legal group.  From my standpoint as well, in light of the extensive working=
 relationship I have been fortunate to have with Enron and many of its lawy=
ers over the past 6-7 years, it has been very hard to witness the Company's=
 difficulties and the relentless barrage of negative news and publicity eve=
ryday in the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times, particularly since=
 I know that virtually everyone I have worked with at the Company is of the=
 highest caliber, character and integrity.   To see the Company tarnished h=
as been vry tough to watch.  Although it may be hard to see it right now, l=
et's hope that some good comes out of this incredibly difficult situation a=
nd that the integration with Dynegy goes well.  I would think that your ski=
ll set would be valued highly by Dynegy, particularly in light of its heavy=
 focus on gas and power trading.  Hang in there, Jeff.  Perhaps the next ti=
me I am in town, we could catch up for lunch again.

Best regards.

John
