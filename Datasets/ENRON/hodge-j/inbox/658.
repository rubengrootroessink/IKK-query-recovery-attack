James,
 
    The attachment is a  memo that I faxed to John Hodge earlier today.  It captures two items that  were part of the deal that are not captured in the confirmation.
Since I do not know who is responsible  for documenting those understandings,  I am emailing the attachment to you  with a copy to John and me.
 
Regards,
 
Dick Bryan
