Jeff,

Attached are the exposures pre and post-petition for Bethlehem Steel seperated by month.  We sent out an invoice for the second half of October on the 10th and payment is due the 26th of November.  We will put together December exposure as soon as the December index is published.  Please let me know if you have any questions.
