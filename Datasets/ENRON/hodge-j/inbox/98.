Ruth,

I have confirmed the meeting with Williams to discuss the Athens and Hart Co. projects for 3:00 on Wednesday.  Location TBA.  We will meet with Allen Smith and Orlando (Alvarez?).

Regarding the Midway project in St. Lucie County (and other sites as well)  we need to get a rough estimate on the estimated schedule for completion.  In particular, we need to know whether it is possible to get gas to the Midway site by May 2002.  Is there any way we can talk to someone today about this?


Thanks.



Raimund D. Grube
