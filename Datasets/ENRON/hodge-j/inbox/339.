John,
Do you think you we be able to submit a quote for the facility behind COH 5-2  and/or the facility behind COH 7-3.  I am hoping to have all responses in by tomorrow morning and then, make a decision.  I hope to hear from you soon.  Also, if you did not receive the load profiles on these two facilities, I have attached them below.  Reminder:  They are looking for firm supply to the gate at a NYMEX based price.







Thanks,
Aiysha M. Billings
