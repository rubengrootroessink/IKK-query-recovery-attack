Here's what we're looking for on TCO. Delivery points should be primary delivery but we need the right to move to secondary points to keep up with retail demand:

Market Area		Volume/day(dth)		Term
2			3000				12/01 - 02/02
3			4000				12/01 - 02/02
35			8000				12/01 - 02/02
39			1000				12/01 - 02/02
9			5000				12/01 - 02/02

If you have portions available of the above, I will consider smaller packages as well. The Columbia systems are planning to operate their systems much as they've done last year which could cause havoc during colder weather. We are planning to be on the overprotective side of the equation; on some days, this may imply that we sell back to you some packages if we are unable to find a home for it ourselves.
