Jeff,

Rio Bravo Pipeline agreed to all the changes to the CA except the two year term.  Their reasoning is that it will take almost three years to build the pipeline, so they want to make sure the CA covers the entire timeframe before the pipeline is in-service.  As we discussed last week, keeping the term at three years is not something that ENA cannot live with.  With that in mind, I told them that ENA would agree to the three year term.

Please initial so that I can get Frank to sign.  We are trying to get this faxed down to El Paso's Mexico office this morning.

Thanks,

Ruth
