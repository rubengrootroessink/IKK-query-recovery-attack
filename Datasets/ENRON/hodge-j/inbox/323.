Kelly,
I received a Revision in Estimates of Monthly Metered Supplies from CNR for JML Oil & Gas for the month of October.  The original estimate was 109,718 Dth on Contract 12, Sitata #283294 (per the CNR Oct01 Estimates supplied by Terry Franklin).  This volume should be reduced to 69,551 per the revision faxed to me by Cath Clark. 
However, I would make the change effective  next Tuesday for the balance of the month with cash price stron for the weekend.
Please call if you have questions.
John
