John,

I met with Con-Ed last week.  They asked if Market Link @ Leidy was going to be good liquid point to buy long term supply.  I told them that I didn't think so but would do a little research for them.  I know you worked pretty hard on this one.  Do you have an overview/summary that  I could look at including some rough economics.
