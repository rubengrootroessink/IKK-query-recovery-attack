Hello,
I need to lock in TCO pool supply for my customer starting April 02 through July 04. Yes, this term is correct and they in fact want to lock this in soon (at the latest Tuesday morning). I have attached their load profile below. They are looking for a Nymex plus applicable basis quote. BUT, they want seasonal pricing (i.e. a winter quote and a separate summer quote). In other words they want to see 5 different prices (Apr02-Oct02, Nov02-Mar03, Apr03-Oct03, Nov03-Mar04, and Apr04-Jul04). I hope this makes sense and if you have any questions please call me at 502-214-6364 or send me an e-mail. Thanks for your help in advance.
















Sincerely,
Aiysha Billings
