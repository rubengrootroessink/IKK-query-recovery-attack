Stevie, 
per J.Hodge NIMO ticket #1089776 s/b 1,774 instead of the 1,724 on the ticket.  So i reduced your volume(delivered to citygate) from 447 to 398 on
ticket  #1009016 for the 6th ONLY.
I did not change the tickets because i did not want to leave you out of balance, so please update Monday.



thanks
joann
