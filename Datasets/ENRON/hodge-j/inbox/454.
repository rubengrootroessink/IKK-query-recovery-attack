Bill, 
Here is the message I received from Conoco.  I spoke to Gayle Hayter and Greg Finn (I know both from the IECA).  
Gayle's title is Senior Treasury Analyst, Phone (281) 293-3594
Greg's title is Supervisor, Corporate Credit & Financial Services, Phone (281) 293-6897
Let me know if there is anything I can do to help.
Thanks,
    Ken
