Can everyone meet on Monday. April 23? As Victor suggested, it would be a good idea to get everyone together
and make sure we are all on the same page. 

Please let me know so that I may schedule a meeting room sometime in the afternoon.

Thank you,
Maria

The VNG book should currently only have 4 injection tickets.

1. Forward sale to VNG (Paper inventory) - Sitara 699457 (Volumes are hedged-any deviations from the monthly volume need to 
	be communicated to Risk so that Tag can be altered)  Price is at index plus WAC of transport and injection variables.

Applies to following Sitara tickets	
Tickets  represents volumes that ENA borrowed at a zero price and are priced at injection costs. Volumes are hedged.  If the monthly volumes in the sitara tickets deviate from the original volumes, please communicate to Risk so that TAG can be adjusted to reflect the actual monthly injections.
Volumes are currently in at a  ratable injection schedule and can and should be adjusted to reflect the best 'economic' injection schedule. 

These tickets should not be put in as sales to VNG.

2.  Forward sale to Dominion - Sitara 725453
	
3.  TCO CPR Pipeline Exchange - Sitara 723220.  Serves same purpose as CNG injection ticket.  Please advice if this ticket should be 
a sale to TCO as opposed a CPR ticket to allow for proper scheduling.

4.  Transco WSS CPR Pipeline Exchange - Sitara 594261. Please advice if this ticket should be 
a sale to Transco as opposed a CPR ticket  to allow for proper scheduling

Sale to VNG and ENA injection tickets should not exceed the maximun quantity allowed to inject in all storages for the summer months.

Clarissa....can some one explain to me what Sitara 730186 represents? It looks like a sale to VNG.  Do this volumes need to be moved to
another ticket? Please advice.
