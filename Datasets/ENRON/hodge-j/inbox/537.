Rob:

I'm finalizing the execution copies (although I"m still waiting for final
word from credit -- I"ll nag them).  One quick question:  where is Southern
Power Company incorporated?

   See attached document w/ some legal edits regarding arbitration. We
   would
   rather arbitrate at a neutral site.

   Can we go with this.

   I've followed up on the arbitration issue.  We can delete arbitration if
   SOCO will agree to exclusive venue in the state courts of Harris County,
   Texas or the federal courts in the Southern District of Texas.

   I'm only in the office till 1pm CST today and then I'm out for the
   holiday.
   I'll push this through to get it finalized before I leave today if at
   all
   possible after I hear from you.

      See attached agreement with appropriate revisions.  We desire to
   strike
      all
      of section 11 on Arbitration.  If you could consult with your general
      council on this issue I would appreciate it.  Let me know the outcome
   of
      that questions and lets finalize.

      Outside counsel needs the number and I asked what he in fact needs --
      I'd
      assumed EIN.  However, he actually needs the organizational ID number
   (I
      guess that's what it is called) assigned by the secretary of state
      (probably) when the company is formed.  The number may be found in
   the
      articles of incorporation.  If you can't find the numbers in the
      articles,
      let me know.

         Robert:

         Attached please find a slightly revised version of the master
   netting
         agreement marked against version 3 that I sent yesterday.  I added
   a
         representation regarding the parties' status as transmitting
      utilities,
         and
         I also made a few modifications to the preamble and signature
   block
      to
         include the jurisdiction of incorporation, chief executive office,
      and
         organizational id number for each party.

         Leslie

            I agree with all your changes except section 11 on Arbitration.
      In
            general
            we do not arbitrate.  Can we on New York Governing Law.

            If we can agree on New York law,  then I can start the
   signature
            process.

            Please call me if you have any questions.
