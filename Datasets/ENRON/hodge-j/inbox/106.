Ruth,

Welcome to the Fort Pierce Repowering Project, aka "FPRP", (now that John has become a traitor err trader).  The following list contains the latest and greatest natural gas needs for this project (if anyone copied notices any discrepancies with my information, I need to know yesterday <- that soon):

Pressure Requirements:  per the Mitsubishi 501F technical specs, required pressure at the inlet is 530psi, however, this does not include losses.  Therefore, the required pressure off of FGT's mainline needs to be 560psi.
Hourly Gas Requirements:  even though we have reviewed various turbine configurations, the amount of hourly gas needed for this project has managed to hover around 2,100mmbtu/hr using 16 hour/day run cycles.
Looping vs Lateral:  we are willing to defer to FGT's recommendation provided that a single meter configuration be used as opposed to a dual configuration.
Timing:  plans are for the plant to be running in a simple-cycle configuration by June '02 and a combined-cycle configuration by Sep '02.  Therefore, we will need pipeline construction completed by Apr '02 for start-up and testing.
Phase VI Strategy:  the plan has been to either get this construction rolled into the Phase VI expansion (it would be the first piece of Phase VI initiated in order to meet our time deadline) or to have the construction covered by FGT's blanket for normal construction.
FGT Deadline:  It is my understanding that FGT needs to finalize the Phase VI plans by April 30, 2001.  

That is everything that comes to mind at this time. If you or anyone has any comments, changes, questions or interesting anecdotes, let me know.

Thanks,
Mathew
