John,

   The attached file shows the storage impact of the Hopewell adjustments.  The
spreadsheet gives the original storage impact of the orginal billed volumes,
the impact after Jan adjustments, and the impact after the May adjustments.  A
difference column is also included.  These arrangements are all Emporia
nominations.
