Dan and/or Sandy - As I requested yesterday, we would like to get a copy of=
 the actual assignment of the Gas Contract from Enron to HPL.  It has becom=
e even more important for us to receive that as our accounting group wants =
to know who it should be paying and, as you can understand, we need to assu=
re ourselves that HPL was the actual contracting party and, therefore, is o=
wed the money for gas purchased thereunder before we release the money to H=
PL.  Also, it will be important to see what date the assignment occurred an=
d, if Enron and HPL want payments to occur that are different than the effe=
ctive date of the assignment, we will need to receive proper authorizations=
 from both parties indicating  different payment scheme.  Thus, if the assi=
gnment is effective on Dec. 1, we will pay Enron for all gas purchased ther=
eunder through Nov. 30 unless instructed otherwise (and we will need both p=
arties' concurrence on this)! .  Until we get proper authorization, our acc=
ounting people have been told to hold the money owed so we pay the proper p=
arty.  In this connection, it would be helpful to get this information as s=
oon as possible.  If you have any questions regarding this, please call me =
at (972) 628-2750 or Doug Linenweber in accounting at (972) 628-2755.  Than=
k you.=20
