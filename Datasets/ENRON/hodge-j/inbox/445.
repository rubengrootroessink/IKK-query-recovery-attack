Please use the attached Gas Adoption Agreement that I have just revised with Jeff's input.  Please note that if you have Gas Industries Standards Board (GISB) Master, the Schedule B language will have to be changed to conform to the GISB nomenclature.  Jeff will send everyone a sample of a GISB type adoption agreement once he's completed
an example of one.

Please call me if you have any questions regarding the attached.

Steve

Attached please find the Adoption Agreement for Gas Masters incorporating what we've learned from the Financial and Power Adoption Agreements, and modified to reference to current form of Gas Master.

Tana and Travis, I will take over the review of the Gas Masters and drafting of Adoption Agreements that Travis was slated to review.

Peter,  Please call me about the Canadian Gas Masters once you have had a chance to review the attached.

All, please call with any questions about the attached.  You should all now have files containing the Masters.

Steve
