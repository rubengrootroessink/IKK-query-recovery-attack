John,
Truing-up estimbated production to actual production should no be a problem.
1.  In the case of Gatherco and CNR Gathering, the estimated volumes, by meter in for Gatherco, and by transport contract by CNR, have already been adjusted for OBA's when the nomination is made.
2. In the case of CGas, the estimate in our pool has not been adjusted for the OBA.  However, since the pool operator sells the estimate, the origination should be caluclated on the estimate.

We still need to figure out how to true-up the origination $ from estimated production to actual production.

Nelson & John,

Terry Franklin has prepared an Appalachian Estimated TCo Metered Production for Nov 01 schedule which she will provide you.  This represents our attempt at calculating the origination dollars (at TCo Index + 1/4 cent) attributable to the TCo Metered Production.

I'm not exactly sure how to create a transfer from John Hodge's book to the Wellhead book for these dollars ($14,981).

Terry will also provide the same format to capture DTI metered production origination.

John
