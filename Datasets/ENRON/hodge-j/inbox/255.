                      COLUMBIA GAS TRANSMISSION CORPORATION
                        NOTICE TO ALL INTERESTED PARTIES
                                OCTOBER 18, 2001

Notice ID: 3193
5 - NO RESPONSE REQUIRED


NOTE:  The following is being provided by Columbia as notice to all of its
shippers of potential outages or reductions in available capacity in the
identified portions of the system due to construction activities, routine
maintenance, modifications, tests or repairs undertaken to protect the
integrity and performance capability of its storage and transmission
facilities.  The information provided below is subject to change for numerous
reasons, including but not limited to, third-party controlled events and
decisions, weather, work schedules, equipment availability, force majeure
events, etc.  Thus, while Columbia is willing to provide this notice and update
it periodically as necessary, Columbia is unable to represent and warrant that
the specific activities will occur, or that they will occur on or near the
specified dates.

SUBJECT:   LINE SM-123

Columbia anticipates that between October 25th and October 27th, Line SM-123
will be taken out of service due to long-wall mining activity.  Columbia
estimates the line to be out of service for twenty-one (21) days.  The start
date and duration of the outage is contingent upon the actual timing and
progress of the long-wall mining activity.  Given the level of firm commitments
in this area, Columbia believes that there will be no available capacity for
interruptible transportation.

The following receipt points will be affected:

   Equitable Gas:    Beaver Creek      (H1)
                     Hi Hat            (F3)
