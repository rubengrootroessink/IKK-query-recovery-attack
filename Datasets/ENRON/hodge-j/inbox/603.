EFFECTIVE 12/1/01 - RB Robertson & Sons is canceling his contract with Enron for approx 1,000/day metered production. 

Reason:  With fixed prices in the $3.50-$3.70 range, Roc and his investors want to lock -in for a period greater than one year.  He will sign a contract with Dominion Field Services.
