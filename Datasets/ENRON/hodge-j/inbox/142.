John,
Per our conversation, I am looking for a NYMEX plus basis quote for two customers in the Virginia Area for Nov01 through March02.  One customer is located on TCO Op10 Mkt Area30 and the other customer is located on TCO Op10 Mkt Area31.  Attached is their historical profile.  Please let me know if you can deliver primary firm into these market areas.  Thanks very much.

I appreciate your help.
