Hello,
I am looking for supply for two facilities in Ohio.  The first is located behind COH 7-3 and the second facility is located behind COH 5-2.  They are looking for firm supply to their respective gates.  I have attached their load profile below.  I am looking for a Nymex plus applicable basis quote.  Please let me know if you are able to bid on one if not both facilities.  I look forward to hearing from you soon.





Sincerely,
Aiysha Billings
