Jeff and Deb,

Please use the attached form of Adoption agreement when dealing with Gas Masters; it adds a missing "of" in Section 4 and it Triangularizes the Set Off provision, which we think will ultimately be a positive feature in "selling" the form to a counterparty. . . especially a counterparty who already has a power and/or financial master in place with ENA/EPMI.  Please let me know if you have any questions regarding the attached.

Steve
