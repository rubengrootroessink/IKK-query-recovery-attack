Jeff,

I'm forwarding this resume to you in case you are looking to extend your team.

I met Emma last week at an Enron Europe gathering - her husband works here.

Regards,
Ellen

Hi Ellen

It was great to meet you yesterday. It was a most enjoyable night!

As promised, here is my resume. I'd be most grateful for any leads you
may have.

As a brief recap on yesterday's conversation, I am trained as a
solicitor in the UK and moved over here 18 months ago. I am currently
working at Compaq, but am very interested in looking at other
opportunities outside of the company. My current role is as a Contract
Manager within the supply chain organization. I  support several
business units and deal with a variety of legal issues, including
Procurement Contracts, Licensing Agreements and  NDA's.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Best Regards

Emma Caplan
