                      COLUMBIA GAS TRANSMISSION CORPORATION
                        NOTICE TO ALL INTERESTED PARTIES
                                OCTOBER 01, 2001

Notice ID: 3144
5 - NO RESPONSE REQUIRED


SUBJECT:   LINE SM-123

Due to long-wall mining activity occurring under Columbia's Line SM-123 in
Mingo County, WV, the line will be taken out of service.  Columbia anticipates
this outage to begin in late October 2001 and run through approximately
mid-November 2001.  However, the start date and duration of the outage is
contingent upon the actual timing and progress of the long-wall mining
activity.  Given the level of firm commitments in this area, Columbia believes
that there will be no available capacity for interruptible transportation.  The
following receipt points will be affected:

   Equitable Gas:    Beaver Creek      (H1)
                     Hi Hat            (F3)

   CNR Pipeline:     Boldman           (CNR02)
                     Conoway           (CNR03)
                     Johns Creek       (CNR08)
                     Canada            (CNR09)
                     Canada            (CNR10)
                     Stafford          (CNR11)
                     Thacker/Majestic  (CNR12)
                     Briar Mtn.        (CNR13)
                     Huff Creek        (CNR14)

   Conoco:           Grant             (P1)

The same is true with respect to any Appalachian production flowing directly
into Columbia's Line KA between Columbia's Boldman Compressor Station and
Columbia's Huff Creek Compressor Station as well as production flowing into
Columbia's Lines SM-116, KA-15, PM-3 and PM-17.
