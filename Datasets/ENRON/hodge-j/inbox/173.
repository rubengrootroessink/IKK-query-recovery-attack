Mr. Hodge,
At the recommendation of Eric Boyt, I forwarded you a copy of my resume
last month in hopes of getting it passed on regarding a legal analyst
position posted on the Enron web site.  I appreciate your efforts to
forward it on to the people who posted the position.  I am writing to
request that if you are aware of any other openings that could use a person
with my skills set, I would greatly appreciate it if you could forward on
my resume.  In case you lost the previous email, I will attach my resume to
the bottom of this email.  Again, I want to thank you for all of your
assistance.

If you need to get in touch with me for any reason, please feel free to
email me at jcoltharp@pcit.com or call me at 713.646.5014.

Thanks,
Jeff Coltharp
