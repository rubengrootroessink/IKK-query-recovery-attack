Jordan,
 
I spoke with George McKean earlier today who indicated that all assets of Enron were pledged and used as collateral for the dip. As explained to me, that would indicate our 40% equity interest would be pledged but not the underlying assets of Bridgeline. Can you confirm.
 
Joe

As far as I can discern from my limited due diligence, the Bridgeline interests have not been pledged or encumbered by Enron and it does not appear that they have been directly affected by the Bankruptcy.  Let me know if anything else needs to be rundown quickly.
