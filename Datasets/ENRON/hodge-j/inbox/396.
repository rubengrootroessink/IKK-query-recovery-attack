Jeff,

Stacey forwarded the termination agreement to me to process, and I just wanted to let you know that there were only 4 active contracts to be terminated.

1. Enfolio Master Firm Purchase/Sales Agreement (April 1, 2001) between NUIU and ENA -- 96058789
2. GISB (October 1, 1997) between NUIEB and ENA (not NUIU as indicated in agreement and cover memo) -- 96010419
3. ISDA Master Agreement and Credit Support Annex (March 27, 1998) between NUIEB and ENA -- 96014847
4. Netting Agreement (October 1, 1997) between NUIEB and ENA (not NUIU as indicated in agreement and cover memo) -- 96018758

The other GISB dated October 1, 1997 (96029131) was terminated effective June 15, 2000, when the counterparty sent a cover letter with executed consents of assignment (from CES and CEM to ENA), simultaneously terminating both contracts (96029131 & 96029133).

If you have any questions, please call me at 5-9989, or email me.

Thank you,
Susan Elledge
