Just wanted to check to be sure you have all of the following in your shop for responses:

1. ExxonMobil
2. Blake & Belden
3. US Dept of Interior
4. Newark Group

Also, Bill wants to change the standard response letter (and redo Total Fina Elf letters). He no longer is comfortable making the last statement.  

Please give me a call to discuss. Thanks for your help.
