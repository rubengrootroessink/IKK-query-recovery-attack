Attention Deal Compliance and Deal Validation:

New Procedure!!
Pursuant to Jeff Hodge's email below, effective Tuesday, November 6, for all counterparties with both a Master Firm contract and a GISB, all FIRM deals (EOL and telephonic), regardless of length (including one day deals) should be attached to the Master Firm contract.  With respect to EOL deals, Profile Manager has been updated to accommodate this change.  For counterparties with only a GISB as a master, you may continue attaching firm deals up to one month in duration.



Jeff,

Pursuant to your message below, I have updated EOL Profile Manager as follows:

Counterparty					Remove GISB		Add Master Firm
Consolidated Energy Solutions, Inc.		96029232		96002347	
Equitable Gas Company				96029557		96003499
ICC Energy Corporation				96028949		96000633
Innovative Gas Services, Inc.			96021962		96003168
Mirant Americas Energy Marketing, L.P.		96029028		96001565
Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc.		96028966		96028965
Questar Energy Trading Company		96029033		96001878
TotalFina Gas & Power North America, Inc.	96029083		96000448
U.S. Gas Transportation, Inc.			96029469		96011824


As requested, here is a list of counterparties using GISBs as masters in EOL.

 
If you have any questions or need additional information, please call me at ext. 5-9989.

Stacey and Ellen:

	In light of current circumstances, if a counterparty has both a Master Firm and a GISB, please confirm all firm physical transactions (both telephonic and EOL) under the Master Firm and not the GISB.

	Additionally, could one of you provide me a list of EOL counterparties who have a GISB contract listed as their master agreement for EOL.

Thanks,

Jeff
