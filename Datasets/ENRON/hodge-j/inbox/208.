Steve,

This email is to notify Columbia Gas Transmission of Enron North
America's intention to exercise our right of first refusal for the
subject contract.  By this notification, Enron does not agree to
continue the agreement beyond the current expiration date or match the
highest value bid in any subsequent auction.  If you have any questions
concerning this notification, please feel free to call me at (713) 853 -
7276.

Thanks for your help,

John
