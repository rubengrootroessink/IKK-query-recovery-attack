Dan, 
Please see attached the format of the guaranty for Houston Pipe Line Company LP by American Electric Power Company, Inc. 
I have revised this format from our standard format to provide Guadalupe with a format that should be accepting to both parties. 
Questions, just let me know.  614-324-6869. 
Thank you. 
Patty
