Frank:

	The disclaimer language is as follows:

		THE PROPOSAL IS A BASIS FOR CONTINUED DISCUSSIONS AND IS NOT AN OFFER OR
		A COMMITMENT TO CONSUMMATE THE TRANSACTION DESCRIBED.  THE PROPOSAL
		DOES NOT CREATE AND IS NOT INTENDED TO CREATE A BINDING AND ENFORCEABLE
		CONTRACT AND MAY NOT BE RELIED UPON BE EITHER PARTY AS THE BASIS FOR A
		CONTRACT BE ESTOPPEL OR OTHERWISE.

	I hope this is of some help.
