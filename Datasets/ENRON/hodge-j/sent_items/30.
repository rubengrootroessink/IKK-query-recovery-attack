Here is a confirmation that I have played around with and added some appropriate wordng like I would add if I were doing a deal that involved 10 percent or 20 percent swing, differernt  pricing, etc.  

I don't think I have ever had a deal where we had different pricing involving the swing language, so I made one up for you.  Let me know if this helps.
