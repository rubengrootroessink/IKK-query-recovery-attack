Steve,

This email is to notify Columbia Gas Transmission of Enron North America's intention to exercise our right of first refusal for the subject contracts.  By this notification, Enron does not agree to continue the agreements beyond the current expiration date or match the highest value bid in any subsequent auction.  If you have any questions concerning this notification, please feel free to call me at (713) 853 - 7276.

Thanks for your help,

John
