Dear Jeff: 
Thanks for your time earlier today.  Attached, please find the draft GISB and special provisions for each of Enron North America Corp. and Enron Canada Corp.  If you can forward the drafts for the Canadian entity to your counterpart in the Calgary office, I'd greatly appreciate it. 
You may coordinate with me to finalize the agreements.  If you have any questions, or if I may be of further assistance, please feel free to contact me at your convenience. 
Kind Regards, 
Dan
