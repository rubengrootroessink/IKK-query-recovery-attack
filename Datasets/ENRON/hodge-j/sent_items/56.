Mike:

	Thanks for the note.  Things are pretty crazy around here, but it is clear that lawyers will be around here for quite some time.  Anyway, hope all is well with you.  My bright note this fall was the Buckeyes win over "the State Up North".  Give my best to your family.

	Have a great holiday.

Jeff

Jeff,

I imagine you're quite busy these days. Hope everything's okay. Things
are fine here in Cincinnati.

Happy Holidays
