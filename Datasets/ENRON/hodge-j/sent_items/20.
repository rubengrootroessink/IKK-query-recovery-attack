	I guess it would help if I attached the document.  Sorry for the inconvenience.

Andy:

	I am in the process of revising my form CA and, in follow-up to a conversation we had, I would like you to take a look at the arbitration provision.  For ease of reference, the applicable section is Section 7.

Thanks so much for your help.

Jeff
