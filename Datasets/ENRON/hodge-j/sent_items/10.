According to Dick's notes from the deal ticket, we recalled the gas on 12/7/00, 12/28-31/00, 3/8/01, 3/22/01 and 3/24-26/01.  In talking with Cindy, it appears that at least two tickets were put into Sitara.  One ticket was our sale to Colonial and another ticket has us buying back from Colonial.  Sitara # 658124 is the ticket covering the buyback for March 2001.  Looking at the ticket in Sitara, there is an inconsistency between the Sitara volumes and the Unify bridged volumes.  Cindy, have you had a chance to check into this?
