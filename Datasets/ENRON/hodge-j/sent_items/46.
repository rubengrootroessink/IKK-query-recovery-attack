Still talking to Sequent.  We worked with them on Ford and U.S. Gypsum for =
the release of 7000 Dthd like last year.  Trying to get Sequent to finish a=
 2000 Dthd peaking deal with Ford.  Only working with Sequent on these two =
customers, especially in light of Ed's second suggestion.

John,
I have reviewed the contracts (Asset Agreement and the GPA) and here are my=
 thoughts regarding your request.  In short, the agreements do not specific=
ally address capacity being needed by third parties.  ENA does have a right=
 to all of their capacity free and clear of all encumbrances.  Last year we=
 did discuss this issue (the interruptible VNG customers wanting to take re=
leases of VNG capacity), but at the time Jim Scabareti indicated that he wa=
s going to play hard ball with his interruptible shippers in year 2 (i.e. n=
ow), since VNG was really getting tight on assets due year-on-year load gro=
wth and no new capacity additions.  He gave the assets up last year because=
 he did not want to have any noise at the VSCC when the VSCC was considerin=
g the affiliate relationship between VNG and AGLES.  However, as I reflect =
on it now, it seems to me that VNG (aka Sequent) really needs to weigh heav=
ily the decision to release any assets to third parties through this winter=
 (interruptible or otherwise).  At a minimum, any releases should be done r=
ecallable based on weather forecasts based on some HDD amount.  The profit =
sharing provision is the same for years 1 and 2.

My suggestion is that you do the following: (1) remind Sequent about the de=
liverability issue facing VNG and (2) develop a plan with Sequent for talki=
ng to Customers, so as to minimize any VSCC risk since the VSCC thinks Sequ=
ent is VNG's asset manager. =20

Mark Breese is back in the office tomorrow and I will confer with him as we=
ll.  You might seek Jeff Hodge's thoughts as well.  If you have any questio=
ns, please ask.
Regards,
Ed=20
