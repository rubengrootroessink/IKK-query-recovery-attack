No economics or overview/summary, but I would talk to Brad McKay about the basis.  In the past we have valued Leidy at CNG North in the summer and Tetco M3/Transco NNY Z6 in the winter, but Brad has probably refined this by now.  Gas Daily has suggested that they will come out with an index for the point starting this November.  However, they still don't know what liquidity the point will bring.

John,

I met with Con-Ed last week.  They asked if Market Link @ Leidy was going to be good liquid point to buy long term supply.  I told them that I didn't think so but would do a little research for them.  I know you worked pretty hard on this one.  Do you have an overview/summary that  I could look at including some rough economics.
