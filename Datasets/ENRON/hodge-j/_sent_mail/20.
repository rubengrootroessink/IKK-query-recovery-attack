Subject:	FGT Letter re: Florida

Jack,

Thank you for the letter.  I have added some detail regarding Phase VI and the fact that capacity shortages for SE Florida begin around Station 20.  In addition I would like to delete the last sentence of the last paragraph.  Please take a look at these changes and revise so that you are comfortable with them.  If you have any questions, please call me at 713-853-0433.

We are meeting with Florida's DEP tomorrow and would like to present this letter to them at the meeting.  Therefore, I would like to get a copy of the letter on your letterhead later today.  

Best regards,
Raimund D. Grube
