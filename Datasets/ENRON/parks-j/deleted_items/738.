Joe - I hope things are okay with your mom. 

While I am out (back next Wednesday), please work with Jon Hoff on wrapping up the Batch Funding Request  and getting it in front of the Cash Committee (Chip is your contact).    I strongly recommend that you guys expedite the paper shuffle as we are continually under transaction oversite risk.  

Good Luck and I won't think about any of you while I'm gone.
