I thought this was off!  Thanks for letting me know the location!
 
Or, is this a joke?  I'm confused.

Attendees: me,pig,zander and small zander.  Ate a lot of crustaceous bugs, drank a lot, spent money on raffle tickets because the chick selling them was hot, won nothing, drank more, woke up on couch,
.............I feel horrible.
Overall a success despite attendance. Ready to go again.
