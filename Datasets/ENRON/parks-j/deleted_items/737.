If we need something to thread about, here's a thought...........let's figure out how much money we all owe each other from this season........I found my grocery receipts from the last Schliecher trip and to my knowledge Pig needs large canned beer money, etc, etc, etc...........then we can go drink too much at Man Night.
 
OR......
 
We can thread about Pig's violent, virulent, sputtering, fire hose anus !!
