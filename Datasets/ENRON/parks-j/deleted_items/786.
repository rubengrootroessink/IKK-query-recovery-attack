Jim, I've prepared a draft payment request form and am gathering supporting documentation.  The intent is to present both cases to the committee.

Lisa, I've asked Karen Gruesen/Jim Coffey to assist me since they have the information relating to Exxon.  I am working with Joe Parks on El Paso.

Troy
Can you generate a payment request form.

Lisa
Can you have someone generate a wire request form to AEP on this?

Send AEP the money, Enron has no interest in this money and it is not property of the Estate  bng

I have received a similar question and would love to get an answer on this.  Is there a distinction between a loan and a payment received by mistake for purposes of repayment from a debtor company?

We have just learned that Exxon sent their Sept, Oct, Nov, and Dec 2001 King Ranch Processing checks to Enron rather than to AEP totalling $4.6mm.  AEP have called asking for their money.  Please advise.
