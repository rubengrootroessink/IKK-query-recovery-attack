Subject:	Florida swing supplier

Update:  ENA was buying daily swing gas from Sequent on Florida to supply the City of Tallahassee deal.  Sequent says this deal is an administrative burden and has elected not to supply any more gas to ENA after 2/1/2002.  Scott Goodell called Aaron Bohall with PanCanadian to see if they would become our new swing supplier.  Aaron told me that they would sell us gas under the following conditions, 
	the deal has to be on PanCanadian's paper
	we need to let PanCanadian know by 8:00 AM every morning
	and ENA must take the same daily volumes over weekends and holidays.

This is a problem because Tallahassee does not have to take the same daily volumes over weekends and holidays and Tallahassee does not need to notify ENA until 9:00 AM.  Aaron will see if they can work with a 9:00 AM deadline.
