I spoke with Hunter this afternoon and he affirmed that the UBS folks that we met with Monday (2/4) ARE going to help with the gas curve validation process.  Hunter will have them get with their respective Estate regional leads (Brad/East, Kevin/Central, Joe/TX & West) to divide work and get going.  Please get together and get copies (paper and electronic) of broker quotes asap so we do not loose time.

Tim/Kathy,  you may need to have a meeting to organize, but I leave that with you.

Regards,
Ed
