I think that is right.  So long as it is absolutely clear that the money was paid in error, return the money to El Paso that was erroneously sent by El Paso to ENA.

I am sending a carbon copy of this to Barbara Gray to confirm that I am giving the correct advice.

hey, why get in the middle. its not our responsibility to get AEP their money. Don't you think it would be cleaner to just give it back to EL Paso.

Send AEP the money, Enron has no interest in this money and it is not property of the Estate  bng

I have received a similar question and would love to get an answer on this.  Is there a distinction between a loan and a payment received by mistake for purposes of repayment from a debtor company?

We have just learned that Exxon sent their Sept, Oct, Nov, and Dec 2001 King Ranch Processing checks to Enron rather than to AEP totalling $4.6mm.  AEP have called asking for their money.  Please advise.
