i got your email thread right here, dog.  Hey does this really go the Park's enron email?  Cool!  I bet not, I bet it goes to L2q3r6ft Raptor partnership in the Caymans.  In fact, I bet Joe is not Joe at all, instead he Joe Lay.  You know the second gunman......hmmmmmm..

Subject: Man Night
 
Men:

Hunting season is over. It is now working season. All email threads are
gone. No one talks to one another. This is wrong.

I therefor propose man night February 28th, 2002 at some location yet to be
determined, such as Tony's mexican food...on Ella.
