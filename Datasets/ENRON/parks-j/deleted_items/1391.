> An old man in Phoenix calls his son in New York and says, "I hate to ruin
> your day, but I have to tell you that your mother and I are divorcing;
> forty-five years of misery is enough." 
> "Pop, what are you talking about," the son screams.
>  
> "We can't stand the sight of each other any longer," the old man said. 
> 
> "We're sick and tired of each other, and I'm sick of talking about this,
> so you call your sister in  Chicago and tell her."   And he hangs up. 
> 
> Frantic, the son calls his sister, and she explodes on the phone,
> "Like heck they're getting a divorce, I'll take care of this." 
> 
> She calls Phoenix immediately, and screams at the old man, "You are NOT
> getting divorced! Don't do a single thing until I get there.  I'm calling
> my brother back and we'll both be there tomorrow. Until then don't do a
> thing, DO YOU HEAR ME?" And she hangs up. 
> 
> The old man hangs up his phone and turns to his wife. "Okay," he says,
> "They're coming for Thanksgiving and paying their own way."
