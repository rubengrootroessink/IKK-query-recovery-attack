Gentlemen,
 
 
            Please access www.mertzranch.com <http://www.mertzranch.com/> and witness my photographic skills and Joe's obvious hunting skills as a picture of Joe's 9 point is being proudly displayed on Michael's web-site!!!! Methinks using Joe's deer and my photographical skills as a shameless plug for Michaels ever expanding  Outfitting Monopoly?.should grant us (hunter and photographer) certain royalties normally associated with this sort of unlicensed usage of this form of media. Basically, we need a price break for use of picture!!!! Anyway, pretty cool seeing your very own photo displayed on a website!!!!
