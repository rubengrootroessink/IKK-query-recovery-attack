I think you are right on there...I'm just telling you that if you had seen =
that 10 point I shot "on the hoof", not dead on the ground w/ a cut out low=
er jaw for inspection, you would have said "Damn, that's an old deer."=20
Compared to his Identical Offspring. Same body size, Same EXACT antler form=
ation (9" g-2's, with a 2 inch kicker coming out sideways from his left G-2=
, and crab claw) The only difference b/w these 2 deer was the young one had=
 about 2 inches more spread, and about 15 inches more total antlers) Mass w=
as more on my deer, indicating age. The BIG difference was standing side by=
 side, the younger one looked like a "thoroughbread Horse", while mine look=
ed like a mule...if you can understand that. That being said, if we think t=
hat we are underestimating age on the hoof and putting all the criteria tog=
ether about what "formula" makes a old deer look old, I would have to say t=
hat My 10 point was "Mature and on his way down" while the young one (Same =
deer that Keith has seen, too) is "Mature and on his way up". The last thin=
g I have to say about that was that the "Young" deer of the two was definit=
ely the "dominant" of the two as well. He was aggressive towards my "ol' ba=
stard" and the old guy didn't want any part of him...The young one was pass=
ed on harvesting by both Keith and myself and I chose to harvest the older =
one of the two. Put in the same arena with a bunch of does and his younger =
sibling, that younger sibling was gonna get the chance to "pour the Chili" =
while the old guy snuck in from the brush, got bullied away by the "stud", =
ate enough to survive, and silently sneaked away. Meanwhile the younger stu=
d, ate and chased does around to his hearts content, no worries about anyth=
ing. Which deer needed to get shot in that scenario?
My final answer...my deer..7.5 yrs or older. His son, 4.5 and about to be a=
 Texas Big Game Award winner next season if he lives through the summer and=
 doesn't "disappear" like a lot of the other bucks we never see again from =
year to year.=20
