Subject: New Lease Update


Talked to Mertz last night. Take this for whatever it is worth...
Bottom line is that he says the lease I sent him, 16,000 per year for
2002
to 2005 looks good, it is the money he wants, we take good care of his
place, shoot mature bucks and we will get the lease, BUT he won't sign
the
lease until next fall, "because I don't have to". Whatever.
I said we just wanted to know for certain that we had a place to hunt
for
the next four years and wanted to make sure we did not need to start
looking
for another lease. He said we had the place and not to worry about it,
he
just wanted to see how the new protien program panned out before signing

off. Once again, whatever. He also says he's pouring the stuff out heavy

right now.
He gave me his word and seemed upbeat about everything. I'm going to
leave
it at that until next fall. I'm not going to worry about it anymore. His

great deal on the Zander's old lease fell apart on him (he was suppossed
to
have out of state hunters show up for two weeks and they were going to
pay
him 30k a year). Maybe the concept of some good lessees who pay on time
and
take care of his land will look more realistic and attractive.
He, as usual, stressed his never ending desire to grow a big deer. He's
counting on this new super food to do it this year. I guess the best we
can
do to assure a lease renewal is to hunt hard and kill him some big deer.

Site in your guns and bring plenty of ammo next fall.
Erik.
