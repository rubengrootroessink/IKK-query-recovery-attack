I will have to bring another MAN to our event in order to break my previous
"family-on-family" event into a "we will MAN-off and let the family go do
whatever the hell they want" night.  A couple of you know him already --
Dave Weiland, and he'll be in town that night.  Otherwise, we'll just go to
Tony's by ourselves, for whoever's interested in that route.
