It is with mixed emotion that I confirm that Dan Leff will be leaving Enron in mid-May.  Dan was approached by and has accepted an excellent position with another company.  Dan recently stepped up to manage the wholesale and retail businesses.  In a short time, he has developed a solid team and a clear plan that can move forward under the direction of Bob Semple from Zolfo Cooper and our funtional leaders including Jeremy Blachman, Anthony Dayao, Eric Holzer, Kyle Kitagawa, Don Miller, Vicki Sharp, Ed Smida, and Wade Stubblefield.  I am sorry to lose Dan, but I want to congratulate him and wish him well in his new career.
