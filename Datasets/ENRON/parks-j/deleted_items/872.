Suggest we hold off for now until we get the working gas deal done with Bridgeline.  Its good info to know that someone is interested in the capacity.

Subject:	ENA's position on Bridgeline Storage/Transport

Spoke w/ El Paso's pipeline group this p.m..  They are extremely interested in pursuing discussions.  I did not disclose contract specific details....just explained the benefits of owning a position on Bridgeline.  El Paso believes they already have authority to purchase transport/storage on other pipeline assets through SONAT.  If they are correct, the time period to transact is significantly reduced.  

Do we need to send a letter to Bridgeline to get authority to share contract specific info??? In other words, give direction on how to pursue.
