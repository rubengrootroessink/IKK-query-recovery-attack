Attention All:
 
TrizecHahn (building property management) will be turning off the 12th floor water to restrooms and 
water fountains at 6pm this evening.
 
They're doing demo work on another floor and need the water turned off temporarily.
The water supply should be restored by tomorrow morning.
 
Thank you,
