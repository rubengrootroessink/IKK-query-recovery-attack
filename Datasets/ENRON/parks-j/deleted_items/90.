As you may know, for the past several months the Response and Production (RAP) Team has been collecting documents responsive to numerous government and Congressional requests.  

In connection with that effort, we must identify all offices and departments likely to have documents relevant to communications between Enron and the following federal agencies, between the dates of January 1, 1992 to December 2, 2001 (other than publicly available periodic filings required by law):

a)	Executive Office of the President
b)	U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
c)	U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
d)	U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
e)	U.S. Department of Labor
f)	U.S. Department of Commerce
g)	U.S. Department of Energy
h)	Overseas Private Investment Corporation
i)	Export-Import Bank of the United States

In addition to the above listed agencies, please identify all current and/or former Enron personnel who may have had contact with any U.S. government official.

This request should be accorded high priority and given immediate attention.  Please respond promptly to the undersigned by email or telephone.

Thank you in advance for your cooperation.
