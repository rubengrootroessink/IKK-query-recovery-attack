On that note, there is a good "proxy" for what you guys should be trying to
build at the "little airport" (as Charlie calls it) by our house.  Golf cart
w/ plenty seating, ground clearance, all-terrain tires and painted camo.
Looks like the Stealth Viking you are looking for.  I can ask someone over
there about it if I see it again.

Chad and Pig:
in light of the contract being signed by the sheep master, I will now be
proceeding at full tilt in an effort to locate our "silent death mobile".
Chad, warm up your creative juices and paint.
