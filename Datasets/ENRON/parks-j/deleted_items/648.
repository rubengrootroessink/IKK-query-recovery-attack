Actually, for the most part I think we are starting to reach a point where we have inputted the majority of what we have.  However, there are still a number of points which we do not have any information on at all like Sonat, Koch, and Florida. Then, of course, many of our points do not go out that far into the future.  Lastly, these additional quotes can make a difference in what the shape of the curves may be.  Thus, what I guess I'm trying to say is that we are reaching a point where we really need to get these additional quotes loaded or at least gain access to them so that we can continue to make progress on the curve validations.   
 
On the east, I am also still working with Chance to get access to Sandra Brawner's revised curves so that we can either load or copy that into the sheets as well.  Once that is done, we can proceed forward with looking at the curves to see if they make sense. 
 
Please keep me posted on what you know about the Truequote progress.  We are at the point where we really need them.
 
Thanks,
 
Kathy

The electronic broker data is coming in various formats and we are in the process of trying to determine if we can automate the loading of the quote data into the templates. So, please continue loading the broker data manually as we work towards finding a better solution.
 
Thanks,
Mike

Sorry that I sent the electronic quote data to everyone on this list...I meant to sent it to our data group that is going to try to get the info into template.
