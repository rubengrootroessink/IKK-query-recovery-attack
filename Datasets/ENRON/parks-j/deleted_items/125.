Joe,

Last night was the first night that any of your gas daily (you began a position on the 14th or 15th)  pl pulled through. It was an error on our side. So the value that came through last night is a net value of all your gas daily trades to date.

The major difference seems to be in gas daily, about $16k. Will you look at it please.
