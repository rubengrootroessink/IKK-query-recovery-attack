Laurie Ellis in settlements is presently attempting to confirm that we have been paid on our Nov01 invoice.  It was sent to Entex on 1/9/02 and the wire payment was due to Enron on 1/19/02.

If we haven't been paid and Entex is knowingly withholding payment, we need to discuss that with them before we talk about flowing any incremental gas.  I'll let you know as soon as I know more.

Still hope to call Entex later today.

Thanks
