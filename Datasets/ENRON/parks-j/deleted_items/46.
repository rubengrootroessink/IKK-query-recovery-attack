Enron has made initial payments toward the purchase of Personal Seat Licenses (PSLs) for Houston Texans Football, and has the right to purchase the associated season tickets.  Enron is no longer interested in these season tickets and is working to secure the best economic result for the estate.  This may involve stopping any further payments, however if there is significant interest among employees in buying the season tickets from Enron, the company may pursue a resale arrangement as one means of recovering the investment it has already made.

If you're interested in purchasing any of Enron's PSLs and season tickets for the Texans, please respond by 4PM, Central Time on Wednesday, June 12 via e-mail to Elizabeth Linnell.  In your e-mail, please indicate the number of seats you would be interested in purchasing and the price category.  Once the number of interested potential buyers is determined from the employee group, Enron will determine how to proceed in order to benefit the estate.   As listed below, the face value of the PSLs range from $1,900 to $3,900 each, and the face value of the season tickets range from $645 to $2575 each.   It is currently envisioned that if any sale of the interests by Enron does occur, it would be open to the public as well as employees.

Please note that your response will not obligate either you or Enron in any way.  Responses will be considered an expression of interest only, and do not guarantee if, when, or at what price respondents may be able to purchase these assets. 

If you have any questions, please call Elizabeth Linnell at x33896.
