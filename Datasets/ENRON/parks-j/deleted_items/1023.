Sounds like Fenner-Weiner is getting his loins all in a furvor regarding
deer hunting, what with all this excitement generated by the documents
forwarded by the Sheep Tycoon.  Could it be that the checkbook is
currently being perused by the Fenner-Weiner?

On that note, there is a good "proxy" for what you guys should be trying
to
build at the "little airport" (as Charlie calls it) by our house.  Golf
cart
w/ plenty seating, ground clearance, all-terrain tires and painted camo.
Looks like the Stealth Viking you are looking for.  I can ask someone
over
there about it if I see it again.

Chad and Pig:
in light of the contract being signed by the sheep master, I will now be

proceeding at full tilt in an effort to locate our "silent death
mobile".
Chad, warm up your creative juices and paint.
