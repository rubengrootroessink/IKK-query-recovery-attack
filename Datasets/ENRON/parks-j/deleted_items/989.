Food: I have a deer sausage lagsana frozen and ready to go. That takes care 
of dinner one night. If we want steaks for second night, I'm ok with that. 
Chad, its your turn to go to the groc. We have yet to even up for the season 
as far as I know B still needs to get even on Keg 1 and 2 and whatever food 
from last trip. I've got about 70 into the thanksgiving food trip.

I think there is plenty of keg beer left, but, i have some canned bud light 
i can bring just in case. no need to buy more. I don't know the scotch 
status, but i think there is plenty left. I can bring a back up bottle from 
the house.

Chad if you are doing the shopping, plan on breakfast/lunch for 2 mornings 
(your stuff and a breakfast roll), small amount of sandwich meat and bread, 
sides for dinners (if wanted...salad)chips and velveta ( there is plenty of 
salsa I believe).

We do not need to worry about ice, couple of bags should do. temps will 
allow hanging of game.

really would prefer am depart tomarrow. e.
