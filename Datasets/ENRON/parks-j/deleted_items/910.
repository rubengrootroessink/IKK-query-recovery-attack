Joe,

Take a look at the mini-dash I've thrown together.  Let me know what comments or corrections you have.  I want to get this to Stuart for his approval this evening so we can have it teed up for tomorrow morning.  The attached is just the verbage, but I think it may make sense to attach your spreadsheet and possibly some support for our Bridgeline valuation as appendices.

Thanks,
Jon
