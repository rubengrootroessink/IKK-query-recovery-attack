Over the past few weeks, we have received numerous requests for information about Enron's iBuyit eProcurement system, both from groups not currently benefiting from iBuyit's cost saving opportunities, and from current users wanting to better understand the new approval processes and procedures since filing for bankruptcy.  In response, we developed iBuyit REORIENTATION.  It's a brown bag session designed for employees to cover the following agenda items:

- An introduction to iBuyit for first-time users and to present the purpose and valuable time/cost saving benefits of the system.
Increased contract compliance and leverage purchasing power.
Reduce procurement time and effort with automated processes.
Control spend through electronic approval routing.
Increased order/coding accuracy.
- A brief demonstration of how easy it is to shop for materials and services using the robust catalog functionality, including demonstration of supplier 	mapping to materials and high-quality images.
- How to request new product additions to the catalog.
- Default data entry by HR org structure.
- Populating other required fields.
- Changes to the workflow and shopping cart approval processes since bankruptcy.
- Discussion on CAO delegation.
- Who to contact for help.
- Who to contact to become a new user.

All of the sessions will be from 11:30am-1:00pm in EB5C2.  To register, please select one of the buttons above.  You will receive an email to confirm your attendance.  Remember, register today, space is limited!
