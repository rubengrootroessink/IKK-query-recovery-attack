Grasshopper #1 very observant.

Troutmaster also watching surf conditions via Internet. Troutmaster worried,
however, that wind forecast appear to call for increasing winds throughout
day and into night, and from wrong direction(s), to boot.

If conditions still appear favorable in late afternon, Troutmaster will call
Beck and Jerry at bait camp for first-hand, beachfront report.

The surfside surf cam at 12:15 looks green to me. Light is starting to come
straight down. winds are south at less than 10 today and should be light
tonight. I think this merits serious consideration for surfside tomarrow
a.m. for dawn assult.
