Today is Administrative Professionals Day -- the one day designated to recognize a year's worth of hard work performed by this group of dedicated professionals.  Although no small gesture can adequately convey the depths of our gratitude, we have made the following arrangements for Enron's administrative professionals in Houston as a token of our appreciation for their tremendous contributions.

First, each administrative professional will receive a gift certificate for up to $5 at Plaza Java.

The Body Shop will also hold a daylong open house Friday, April 26, with a special one-hour yoga class exclusively for administrative professionals at noon.  All administrative professionals are welcome to use the Body Shop at any time Friday regardless of whether they are a current member.  If you cannot work out on Friday, don't worry.  Administrative professionals will also receive a guest certificate to use the Body Shop one day that they choose during May.

Finally, administrative professionals will receive a certificate for $5 off the cost of a massage at the Body Shop.  Then, when they present their certificate at the time of their appointment, they will receive an additional $5 off the cost of a 30, 45, or 60 minute massage for a total discount of $10.  For more information or to schedule an appointment, call 713-853-3047.

The three certificates will be delivered to administrative professionals via interoffice mail.  If you have recently relocated or do not receive your gift certificates by Monday, April 29, please call Ginger McCain at 713-853-7725.

Thank you for all you do to make our jobs easier and our lives better.
