Every morning, the Corporate Communications team compiles Enron-related news articles from major newspapers, magazines and broadcasts from around the world.  To share these articles with all employees, these articles will be posted daily on the intranet at http://home.enron.com/updates/mentions.html.  The articles will be archived on the site for one week.
