Chance, could you please give positions for 2005 and 2006 on a monthly basis the same way as it was done for 2002-2004 (look at the files below). If it is possible, we would need to have it by 4 pm for the meeting. Call me if you have any questions.

Best Regards,
Elena

Here are the files containing in-the-money live position data.  There are 4 files : 2002 monthly, 2003 monthly, 2004 monthly and 2005 out yearly.  The summary information is on the "Financial Book Positions" tab.
 
I did not consolidate them into one report just in case you needed to look at the supporting information.
 
The physical files should be ready within the next few minutes.
 
Let me know if you have questions.
