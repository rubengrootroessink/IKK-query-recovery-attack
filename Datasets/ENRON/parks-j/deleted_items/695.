Oh...LN is back!!! Did you reinjure your back or your knee in a freak skiing accident...or are you OK?

Fishing Report from Plaag outing on Friday...

22 trout...no giant ones, but good solid spring time fish.
All caught on Corkies and Topwaters in the far end of East Bay down by Rollover. Biggest fish was 24", and the rest were 19" to 23". "Shoulda been here yesterday"...Plaag had a bunch of REALLY big fish located over deep mud/shell out in the middle of the bay that they caught the day before on a really low tide. Friday, the tide was up over a foot from the day before and "the spot" was too deep to fish!!! They caught some ridiculous number like 5 fish over 7 lbs and the rest over 5 lbs on Thursday. Oh well...damn fun trip anyway.  Those winter time fish are just plain bigger and stronger than a surf run trout. And they are a lot darker colored...tails almost black. Pretty cool looking stringers!!!
