I assume ENA gets credited with the oney wired in on Friday re Centana.

What's the status on the wire going out today.  Do you have a cash request completed?

Phil

What is going on with Centana.  We have not prepared a wire to go out today and also, we need details about the money wired in to us on Friday.  Who gets credited with this money.
