The desk has, since September 2000, provided "agency services" to the Clebu=
rne, TX facility (owned by Ponderosa Pine Energy Partners, Ltd., f/k/a Tena=
ska IV Texas Partners, Ltd., which is owned by ECTMI (10%) and Ponderosa Pi=
ne Energy, LLC (90%), or "PPEP").  Agency services include gas scheduling/r=
econciliation, purchase/resale, and billing/payment of services provided un=
der three contracts to which Ponderosa Pine Energy Partners is a party:

Lone Star - transport
Apache - supply
Williams - supply

An agreement covering these services was developed by Sandy Braband (no lon=
ger here) and never executed.  The desk received a fee of ~4.5 cents/Dth fo=
r the services.

Based on my conversations with James Armstrong, it appears that pipeline ch=
arges billed by Lone Star between April and September 2001 were billed by t=
he desk to the project.  The project forwarded funds to the desk for paymen=
t of the Lone Star invoices, but the funds never went to Lone Star.  The to=
tal amount still due Lone Star for the period is $515, 985.41.  As the cont=
ract is between Lone Star and PPEP, the amount due must be settled in order=
 to prevent defaults under the project-level loan agreement.  I believe a r=
equest has been submitted to you for payment of the total amount due.  My q=
uestion is can the estate pay the amount due Lone Star or will the project =
need to remit funds directly to the pipeline and file a claim against the e=
state (effectively double-paying the amount due)?  To the extent it's the l=
atter, it's the upstream parties (i.e., KBC/Delta Power) that will have an =
issue with what's happened, as any amounts trapped by the desk (and paid, f=
or a second time, by PPEP) essentially come out of future cash distribution=
s from the project company.
=20
FYI, this is not the only issue that has arisen as a result of this arrange=
ment.  According to James, the project company also paid the desk for Octob=
er 2001 pipeline charges billed by Lone Star and subsequently paid the pipe=
line directly ($108,405) and is owed $600,377.50 for November 2001 gas sale=
s made on behalf of the project.  We're also aware that a large imbalance h=
as built up on Lone Star; Joe Parks is looking into taking care of this pro=
blem while we're determining what DPC/Delta Power wish to do with respect t=
o gas management going forward.

We can try.  The guy who managed this deal for the desk left the Company bu=
t I thought he handed it off to Rick Hill in the estate.  I will talk to th=
e rest of the guys on the desk and find out what we have on it and call you=
.  My basic understanding of this deal is that we provided services only an=
d are agent for the plant.  I believe Rick Hill is the commercial contact o=
n the deal so he should be able to provide more insight to the whole deal. =
 I will get back to you.

Hey Tom,
Rita Wynne just called and let me know that we need to make a payment to TX=
U on behalf of Tenaska.  Since TXU has terminated agreements with us, the C=
ash Management Committee will not make payments to TXU unless they understa=
nd the deal that is in place with Tenaska and we show that Tenaska has alre=
ady paid us their part.  Could you please help Chip Schneider, of Enron Und=
erwriting, and myself get up to speed on this as quickly as possible.  TXU =
is threatening to take action on Tenaska.  Thanks for your help.
