All copier and fax equipment in the Enron building is presently being inventoried.  To minimize costs, copiers and fax machines not needed for on-going operations will be returned to the vendors.  This process requires that we identify the location of each machine, evaluate the quality of the equipment available, determine whether it is leased or owned, and establish the appropriate equipment inventory to support present and future operations.  

During the process of inventorying equipment it is critical that copiers and fax machines only be moved by authorized personnel.  If you are aware of copiers or fax equipment that are in offices, conference rooms or other closed areas, please notify Harry Grubbs at Ext. 3-5417. 

If copier or fax equipment is not functioning properly, or needs toner, please call the Facilities Help Desk at Ext. 3-6300.  If you need a copier or fax machine to be moved,  need additional copier or fax equipment, or are aware of excess equipment presently in your area please contact Harry Grubbs at Ext. 3-5417 or Roy Hartstein at Ext. 53160. 

Thank you,

Derryl W. Cleaveland
