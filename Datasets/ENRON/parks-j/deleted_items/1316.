Verdict:  We still do not have a trailer.  That particular one is WAY bigger than what we need & it had a bent tongue, fixable though.  It sold for $300.

They had another one in the yard that was smaller & in good shape--it may go on sale at the next auction.  I am now on the list for future notices.

Interesting event.  You can literally go in there and buy a functional vehicle for $100 if no one else bids.  Today a nice van sold for $400.  They sold a tractor/trailer for $2500--truck load of skins or crack not included.
Hot item of the day was a 2001 F250 Super Duty 4x4 with 4000 miles on it, loaded, sold for $24000. The book on that truck is about $40K.   Flooded vehicles & other junkers available.  Fun stuff.
