I am not certain that we will ultimately approach Gulf South on the pad gas but it seems to make sense that we talk to them about the storage/transport deal.

Since it appears we are going to approach Gulf South about the purchase of pad gas, shouldn't we also gauge their interest in ENA's storage/transport position, including any available molecules?
