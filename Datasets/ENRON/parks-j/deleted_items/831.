Based on our meeting with Kinder Morgan regarding NGPL-NSS storage contract# 114786 and #114846.  They are expecting demand payment for the month of December (They are allowing January charges to be paid at a later date) from ENA before allowing us to do a permanent release and/or an in-field transfers.  Ruth C. is in the process of filing out a cash request and wire transfer form.  She will then submit it for approval and to the cash management committee.  This process normally takes 5 days.  We are recommending that the process is expedited so that we can get the storage service and inventory sold.    If we pay today, we could potential sell these assets as soon as Friday.


I will be out on Monday.  If this deal does not close Friday, I will give Joe Parks the necessary information to close the deal on Monday.



Sylvia
