FYI, Attached is a copy of the Enron Compression business cash flow status that I handed out at the meeting on Monday.  The Midland Power and GE Capital payments are still in process of being approved and are still on the 5 day list.

Also Troy Denetsosie is preparing a work flow document to chart the gas nomination and sales process for both the NNG and TW gas.  The February gas was nominated for both NNG and TW this week and Troy will be doucmenting the procedures for getting this gas scheduled, priced, sold, invoiced, and booked.  Once this is complete, I will be scheduling an update meeting with everyone to review this.  We can also review the rebate calculations and any other topics.

In addition I am still working on the Enron Compression LLC financials.  I have found booking errors on the ledger that need to be corrected as well as accruals and other entries that are need to be booked.  Ana, I will be sending you an email summarzing these.  Also please let me know if you need any information regarding the needed transfer of funds between Kachina, Gallup, and Hubbard.
