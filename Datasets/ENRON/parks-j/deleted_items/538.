Brian has paid. Chris says his is coming.
All others, please issue your checks for $1,071.00 for each individual.
I have covered the initial $8,000 (!) payment.
Joe, pull the trigger on your 7mm and abortionist and give us the commitment 
we need. Chet, your opportunity is slipping away....how's the NASDAQ today? 
Come on, get it!
