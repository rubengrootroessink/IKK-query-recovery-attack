If we set up any deal in Sitara/Unify, be default, the sale is recognized as an ENA sale.  In order for the sale to be recognized by ECS and for gas sales to be invoiced by Unify, we need to establish an ECS book that must be managed by the trader and appropriate support.  Is this something we want to do?  I want to get a consenus.  Any comments?

Justin,

Per our discussion, can we go ahead and set up the process where ECS deals can be entered into Sitara/Unify for gas sales on TW?

What information do you need to get this process going?
