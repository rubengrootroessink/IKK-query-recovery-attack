Not too worried about oven bugs--hospitals sterilize at about 270 deg.--if I remember the thermostat doesnt work and that oven runs at about 800 deg.
 
Departure: E says he is better off leaving Fri a.m.(4 hunts) w/ Sun return.  I was thinking Fri p.m. for more relaxed Monday return(4 hunts)--I'm OK either way, but I need to let John know if I'm out Fri or Mon.

I think I remember promising to eat dead, raw heart meat...........a..an..and ..I'll 
do it man !!!
 
Most importantly, how did ya'll leave the keg last time--I damn sure don't want to show up Fri. p.m. after being "IN" for four hours and have nuthin' but a cup of dust waiting!!
Lets plan ahead on the Al K. Hall issue, remember I'm drinking for two now..(Pig and I).
 
Food Issue:  Just because Piggy ain't cookin' doesn't mean we have to eat like alternate/persons.  I say we do it right at least on Sat night.(i.e.ribeyes.......)
Sat. a.m.: I made a Mex. egg/cheese/& stuff casserole for x-mas morning that was pretty damn good---I can pre-make it and all we have to do is heat & eat.
 
...other than that: Scotch, coffee, and firearms.
 
My $.02

Can't "pull-off" this weekend.  Libby, Libby, Libby on the label, label,
label is coming in this weekend w/ the boys for a belated xmas gathering and
have a party planned.  Or, maybe it's just that I don't want to be forced to
eat more heart-meat.

As far as I know, Chad, Joe, Erik and Henry going. Either Friday am to
sunday pm or friday pm to monday am. I have invited Chet and not heard from
him. Chris McComb cannot go. Kieth cannot go and has not been despite
planning on going the last two weekends. He intends to go during the
extended doe and spike season.
No other guests invited.
Are you planning on going???????
Don't know about Jim McComb. e.
