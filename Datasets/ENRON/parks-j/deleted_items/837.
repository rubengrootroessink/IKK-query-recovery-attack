Chip,

I am looking for counterparty approval in order to cure the MVC contracts.  MCV contracts are through 2006 and 2007.  Total nominal cash flow to ENA for the term of the contract is $33MM.  The request is only for the month of February.  Approximately $1.2M is needed as a prepayment to receive cash flow of $1.6MM.  The counterparties that are willing to supply ENA are as follow:  Alliant Energy Resources, Nicor Energy L.L.C.,  MidAmerican, NG Energy, and Sequent. 

If you have any questions, please contact my at ext. 36211
