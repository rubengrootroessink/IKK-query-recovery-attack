Ed, note that we have not paid the Nov'01 Tenn. invoice.  This invoice is pre-bankruptcy filing.  If I understand the world of bankruptcy, we will not pay the Nov'01 invoice but WILL pay the Dec'01 invoice (for the term 12/02/01 - 12/31/01).  Do you agree?  Do I need to instruct someone to make payment?

Louis,

We have not paid 11/01 production invoices for Tenn; therefore, we are not current on payments.  12/01 production payment is due 1/24/02.  Anything to be paid out must pass through committee due to our current bankruptcy situation.

I would like to determine that we are current on paying the transportation and storage invoices from Tennessee.  Can you answer this or can you point me to the person who can?

I just faxed everything I received from our volume department (they actually receive this from Tennessee).

Can you forward (electronically or via fax: 713-646-3460) a copy of the Tennessee transportation invoice associated with Entex?  Also, If there is a separate storage invoice, please send that as well.

Thank you.
