Just so we are all on the same page:

1)  Gerald, you are a scumbag for leaving.  The Pan Canadian folks negotiate that weak kneed sissies and drink tea with milk....with their pinky extended.  Regardless, you bring down the average I.Q., but strengthen their resolve.
2)  The Batch Funding Request is done (subject to one final review by Zisman...known is business circles as crater boy, a.k.a. Bridgeline wanna-be).  We are to get this in front of the Cash Committee ASAP and presented as ordinary course of business.  Chip is waiting on us (that is embarrassing).
3)  We only need documents...
