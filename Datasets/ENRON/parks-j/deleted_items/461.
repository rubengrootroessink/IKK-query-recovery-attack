WE DO NOT OFFICIALLY COVER CPN.

CPN released a press release stating that it had completed a portion of its
long awaited $2B credit line.  The new credit facility includes a new $1.0B
and an amended $400MM revolving credit facility (expiring May, 2004).  A 2
year $600MM term loan (as pre-released in the S&P press release a few weeks
ago) is expected to be completed within the next 30 days.  CPN has agreed
to pledge interest in its natural gas producing properties, the Saltend
power plant in the UK and its equity investments in nine US power plants.
The nine US power plants represent additional securitization relative to
the information included in the S&P press release (a negative relative to
expectations).

In addition, CPN presented a Sources and Uses of Cash estimate for FY02
that showed a cash cushion of $1.4B.  However, this estimate included $2.2B
in sources of cash that are contingent on future events.  Sources of cash
remaining to be secured include: 1) the $600MM term loan (expected to close
within 30 days), 2) a $500MM California peaker lease (difficult,
considering the fact that it is backed by a DWR contract that the Governor
is attempting to renegotiate), 3) the sale of $250MM in non-strategic
assets (expected to close by the end of 2Q), 4) a $300MM Canadian royalty
trust to monetize its Canadian powr generation assets (expected by the end
of 2Q), 5) a $150MM sale-leaseback of its Zion power plant (expected by the
end of 2Q), 6) $260MM financing of future turbine purchases that are
supported by long-term PPAs (no timing target set), and, 7) the sale of the
Gilroy accounts receivable from PG&E (which is in bankruptcy) of $175MM
(transaction could take place by the end of 3Q).  In addition, our combined
cycle spot margin indicators are suggesting that the spot market has been
very weak y-t-d ($3.75/MWh average margin and a 65% utilization rate)
relative to CPN's earnings guidance spot assumptions ($8/MWh margin and 70%
to 80% utilization), suggesting that CPN's earnings guidance ($1.70/sh) and
cash flow generation expectations may be too aggressive.

We continue to believe CPN is very speculative issue and that bankruptcy is
a real possibility.  Based on what we know about the name, we are sellers.

CPN has scheduled a conference call today at 10am PST, 12pm CT and 1pm ET.
The dial in number is 973-628-6885.
