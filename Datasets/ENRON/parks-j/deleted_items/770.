Blanca,

Thanks for sending me copies of the invoices AEP sent to Exxon for Sep - Oct. 2001.  We are in the process of verifying the error and the receipt of proceeds ($4,594.243.29).  Once that has occured, we will begin the official request (to the committee that approves all payments) of repaying Exxon.  I will keep you updated on events.
