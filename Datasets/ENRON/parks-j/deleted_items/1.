In light of certain upcoming publications featuring some former and current Enron employees, it is important to remember that the company is committed to maintaining a professional environment for its employees.  To do that, we want to keep potentially offensive materials from entering the workplace.  It is inappropriate to have those kinds of publications, in any format, in the workplace, so out of respect for your co-workers, please leave any such materials at home and do your part to ensure that they do not enter the workplace.  We appreciate your cooperation.

Robert Jones, Managing Director
Human Resources
