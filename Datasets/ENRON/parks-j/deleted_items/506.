Eric, Vicky:

Attached please find the revised MCV potential bidder list:

 

The document is also saved in the following folder:  o:\gas Structuring\Bankruptcy Folder\MCV\

This is includes the additional 16 companies that Ed suggested be kept on the list.  I have called all of the companies they all expressed interest, with the exception of TransCanada which sold its gas marketing company.
