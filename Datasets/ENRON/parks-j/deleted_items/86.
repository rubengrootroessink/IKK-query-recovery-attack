Michael left a vm at my office this morning. He found a license plate on the 
oil field road FPH - 16H. He wondered if it fell off of the flat bed used to 
move tower stand. Or if it was to one of our trucks. If not, he wants to run 
the plates and see who has been on the ranch.

He said they are getting rain, would like more, but things look good. They 
are "pouring out the protien" and thinks every deer and turkey in the county 
is snacking at our place. Deer look fat he said.

McComb guys, let me know if that is the flat bed plate or off the scrambler 
so I can let mertz know.
