Thanks.  I printed a copy.  I need to figure out the best place to meet her
around mile 14 or so.  Let me know what you think.  Meant to tell you that I
need to take Abbey w/ her dress tomorrow for a fitting at 1:30.  I think
Mimi is coming in to go with Allison to pick out a veil so we were planning
on having lunch around 11:45.  Thomas can go too so you have a several hour
window during the middle of the day if you want to make plans to do
something (of course, you could go with us, but I am going to assume that
you aren't interested)..... : )  Off to court.....
