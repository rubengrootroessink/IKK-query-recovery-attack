   The natural gas non-commercial net SHORT position increased
   significantly to 6,151 from 1,056 contracts.  This large increase in the
   net short position was primarily due to the 20% increase in the
   non-commercial short position to 27,103 from 22,655 contracts the
   previous week.
   The natural gas commercial net short position decreased to 8,434 from
   14,947 contracts.  The cumulative natural gas net short position
   decreased to 14,585 from 16,003 contracts.
   The non-commercial crude net short position decreased significantly to
   214 from 12,742 contracts the previous week.  The large change in the
   non-commercial crude net long position was due to the 16% decrease in
   the non-commercial long and the 25% increase in the non-commercial short
   position.
   The commercial crude net position became net long for the first time
   since the week of 2/26/2002.  The cumulative crude oil net position also
   became net long.  The cumulative crude net position has not been net
   long since the week of 2/26/2002 as well.
