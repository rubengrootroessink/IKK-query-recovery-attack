As Steve Cooper has mentioned in his voicemail messages, there will be an All-Employee Meeting this Thursday, April 11.  The meeting will be held at 8:30 a.m. (CST) in the Imperial Ballroom of the Hyatt Regency Hotel.  Unfortunately, the full ballroom was not available until late May, but we did not want to put off the meeting until then.
Capacity at the Hyatt will be limited to 1,400 people seated, with additional room for approximately 200 people standing.  As an alternative to attending the meeting, employees in Houston will be able to listen to a live audio stream and view the slide presentation on their computers at http://home.enron.com/employeemeeting/.  The question and answer portion of the meeting will not be broadcasted.  Shortly after the meeting, the audio broadcast and the slide presentation will be available for all employees at home.enron.com.
Given the current environment and continuing media interest surrounding Enron, we will take extra security precautions at the Hyatt.  Employees attending the meeting will be required to show their current photo employee badge and each badge will be crosschecked with a current employee list.  No one will be permitted into the meeting without their badge.  Due to space constraints, contract workers will not be permitted to attend the meeting.  We recognize that this security process will take time, so check-in will begin at 7:45 a.m. We apologize for any inconvenience this process creates and appreciate your understanding and patience.
We encourage you to submit questions for the meeting in advance.  Please send them via email to "Office of the Chief Executive".
