Dear All:

April 20th is the 3rd weekend in April and the "openning weekend" so to 
speak of our spring turkey season.

Chris indicates he and his Dos Equis / Shiner Bock group will be going to 
weekend of April 27th and they are ready willing and able to work.

Work weekend?? when should it be??? Keith are you available the weekend of 
the 27th? or should work weekend be May 4th??

Is anyone planning on going April 20th? Imput please.
