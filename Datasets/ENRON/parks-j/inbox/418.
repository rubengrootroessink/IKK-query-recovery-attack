I am trying to set this thing up to go in front of the Cash Committee on Monday.  I assume this is your final review.....Joe is cool with what I forwarded him.  After your final changes, I'll forward to Chip, Rich and Doug Sewell...and let them know Monday is the day.

Thanks.  You are a big help and I really admire your skill set....seriously, I do.  I want to be like you when I grow up.
