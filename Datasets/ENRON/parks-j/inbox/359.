Mike,
Attached are the documents that I received from JPMorganChase. I will
fax to you my proposed revisions shortly. I am hoping that Centana and
ENA can agree on revisions to the agreements and get them back to the
bank this afternoon.

Shemen,

Per our conversation, see attached our standard escrow agreement and fee
schedule.  Please review and call me with any questions or comments at

Thanks for letting JPMorgan have the opportunity to serve your escrow
needs.

Greg
