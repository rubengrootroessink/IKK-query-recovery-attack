Joe:

We need to shape three (3) Central curves and could use your help.

			P1		P2
PAN-TX-OK

TRUNKL-TX

WNG-TOK

You have any suggestions as to which point(s) we could use as a primary curve?  Two would be helpful for each

FYI - For NGPL (STX), I ended up using HSC rather than Tennessee after looking at basis differentials against both points.

Thanks.
