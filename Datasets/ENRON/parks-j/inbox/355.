Can we get this reversed out of the system.  I think that a buy from Williams and a sale to Tenaska IV are all wrapped up in this together.  I think that Jan production onward should probably all get reversed out.

Thanks
Margaret

David, we are buying this gas as agent for Ponderosa Pine Energy Partners. It is my understanding that the partnership will be responsible for all billing.

Thanks
