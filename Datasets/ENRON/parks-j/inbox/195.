Not defined yet, but they are building an asset based trading organization,
and I'm certain it would be trading related.
My concern is that the timing won't fit your needs.

Greg,

Dreyfus said they are interested in you but not for the lead role for this
situation. Since you have something that is close, you might not be
available when Dreyfus is ready.
Please keep me posted on your situation and thanks for your interest in my
search.

Randy,

Sounds interesting, I wonder if they have been in contact with Enron, or
anyone here. I would be interested, but within a week or so I may be
elsewhere, so let me know. If they can move quicky,I am not interested in
moving to Conn but have an interest in Houston.

Let me know, the type of person they are looking for fits well timing isnt
great but sounds like they have a bigger plan.


You can email me here or home.

Thanks

Greg Schockling

Greg,

Here is the basic information on Dreyfus. Tim Stuart is the President of
Louis Dreyfus Energy Services, which is primarily the liquids trading
business at present. (go to: http://www.louisdreyfus.com/, click "energy",
and "petrochemicals".
Here is the generic recruiting email I sent out:

I request your assistance in gathering names of candidates for an ENERGY
EXECUTIVE search.

My Client: An $18 billion GLOBAL COMMODITY TRADING organization.

The Opportunity: Through acquisitions and joint ventures, to BUILD AN ASSET
BASED ENERGY TRADING COMPANY with the objective of monetizing the
optionality around those assets.

The Candidate: A STRATEGIC VISIONARY, capable of building a value oriented
organization, and capitalizing upon financial and physical trade arbitrage
opportunities.

Bottom line is they want back in to the physical business and they are
looking for the lead person to do it. The preference is to base them in
Wilton, CT but they will also consider Houston.
Besides experience trading a "physical gas book", this person must have
strong entrepeurnial and strategic instincts. Which assets should they buy?
Why? Which joint venture relationships make sense and why? These issues
require someone with a big picture understanding and vision of the energy
industry and an understanding of how to evaluate and monetize the
optionality of assets.
Some people may be great traders, but they don't have the aggressiveness and
vision to direct the business side of this venture. Some people may have
strong "asset" background but they don't understand how to manage a trade
group to squeeze the most value from assets through sophisticated and
creative trading strategies. This position requires both.
I would like to put your resume in front of them. Your recent experience
trading around the Bridgeline system would be of interest.
Please let me know what you think?

Randy
