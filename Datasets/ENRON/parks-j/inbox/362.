yes, this is a brokered transaction.  I'm not sure the details of the deal, Joe Parks just wanted me to let you know, I just assumed it was because we paid someone on the wrong price.  Joe, you may want to talk to Rita about this.

Sabra,

Is this a brokered transaction because I don't see any contracts for transport for that pipeline?  Also, is someone expecting for payment to be made as you referenced in your last statement.  We have not made any payments other than ones requested by Commercial and approved by the Cash Committee since Nov. 2001 production.

Rita,

We have a path created in Unify that has actuals attached to it for December 4-31, 2001 that need to be zeroed out:

Path ID is 10108728
Track ID is 11112477
Sitara Deal Ticket #941625

The correct path that does show BAV correctly is:

Path ID 24335439
Track ID 11249017
Sitara Deal Ticket #1198556

Please call me if I need to do anything further to help get this paid correctly.

Sabra
