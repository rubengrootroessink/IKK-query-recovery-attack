Well, you never know...
Got back into the office today after taking two days off with Sheila and
family in Fredricksburg to find a thick envelope from Mertz Ranch Company
buried in my "in box". Did not know what to expect, had visions of Mertz
mailing it back with a note saying forget it.
Instead, the lease was signed and dated and had a nice note saying "thanks".

Go figure.

We've got a lease for four more years. Same deal, same contract as the last
three years, just 6K more a year. Price remains the same this year. next
year it is 2k a year per spot and we will need to add one spot. Still
waiting on Chet. Would like to know who McCombs would suggest if Chet does
not commit. Lease requires Mertz to spent 2k a year on protien feed. He and
I can agree in writing to reduce or increase that amount with a
corresponding reduction or increase in lease cost. Term is April 1, 2002 to
April 1 2005; exclusive right to hunt turkey and deer, spring turkey
starting the third weekend in april.

I'm pleased. Hope you are, too.

Erik.
