Shares of Independent Power=20
Producers and Traders Fall=20




By Robert C. Bellemare
Vice President=20


  <http://secure.scientech.com/images/spacer.gif>

[News item from Reuters] Renewed concerns over accounting irregularities an=
d heavy debt burdens took their toll on the power sector on Wednesday, send=
ing shares of independent producers and traders falling. The downturn was t=
riggered by disclosures in The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) of a financing arr=
angement used by Dynegy Inc. (NYSE: DYN) which prompted unwelcome compariso=
ns to Enron as well as an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission=
 (SEC) into energy trader and pipeline operator Williams Cos. (NYSE: WMB).=
=20

Analysis: Just when the market conditions appeared to be stabilizing for th=
e recently hard-hit independent power producers (IPPs), more unwanted bad n=
ews has once again plagued this sector. In addition to Dynegy and Williams,=
 companies such as Calpine, Mirant and AES have had significant news in the=
 past week as the companies make moves to weather the storm of business los=
ses, lowered credit ratings, softening energy commodity prices, and questio=
ns of accounting practices. Let's take a look at the latest developments fo=
r these companies.=20

Dynegy shares closed at $28.79 per share, down by about 4 percent, as the m=
arket reacted to a WSJ article concerning Dynegy's use of off-balance-sheet=
 transactions designed to cut tax bills and address a growing gap between c=
ash flow and net income. Project Alpha, as it was called, was blessed by Dy=
negy's former auditor, Andersen, and current auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers=
. Dynegy was quick to try and distinguish this transaction from the type of=
 business practices that Enron engaged in. Dynegy spokesman John Sousa emph=
asized, "The primary drivers of this transaction were that it provided us w=
ith a long-term source of physical gas supply and a significant tax benefit=
." Sousa also pointed out that no related parties were involved, Dynegy sto=
ck was not used to back the loans, and the transaction was disclosed in Dyn=
egy's financial reports last year. In 2000 the company reported "unrealized=
 gains" of $354 million generated by valuing derivative contracts, increasi=
ng the gap between its profit and cash flow. Trading companies include the =
estimated value for "derivative" contracts they use for future buying and s=
elling of commodities in net income as "unrealized gains." A special purpos=
e entity (SPE) was formed in April of last year with a $300-million loan fr=
om Citigroup Inc. The SPE entered into gas trades with a partnership called=
 DMT Supply LP, in which Dynegy held a stake. According to Dynegy, during t=
he first nine months of operation, DMT bought gas from the entity at below-=
market prices and resold the gas at a profit. But during future years of th=
e project scheduled to end in 2006, DMT will buy gas at above-market gas pr=
ices, generating unrealized losses. By arranging transactions in this manne=
r, Dynegy was able to lower its 2001 tax bill by $80 million. But according=
 to WSJ, higher values were being assigned to derivative contracts than tho=
se assigned to cash transactions which creates a "disconnect" between repor=
ted net income and cash flow that investors could notice.=20

Williams shares also dropped by 4.5 percent on Wednesday to close at $23.08=
 per share on news from WSJ, which reported that the SEC is looking into th=
e company's third-quarter results. In reaction, Williams clarified that it =
had received a request in early February from the SEC for additional inform=
ation concerning the company's 2001 third-quarter results but was told afte=
r a review that no financial adjustments were needed. Williams' spokesperso=
n Jim Gipson said, "We received an informal, confidential request for infor=
mation by the SEC in early February about our third-quarter 10Q. They asked=
 a couple of questions, we responded in writing, they called back in seven =
days and said no amendment to the third-quarter results was required." Gips=
on emphasized that, "We are not aware of any unresolved or open issues at t=
he SEC." Williams reported a third-quarter net income of $221.3 million, up=
 from $176.5 million, or 27 cents a share, earned in the same quarter one y=
ear ago. The quarter included a one-time charge of $71 million for the comp=
any's investment in former subsidiary Williams Communications Group. On Mar=
ch 7, Williams announced it had taken a $2.1-billion charge in the fourth q=
uarter to account for its contingent liability on Williams Communications. =
Williams reported a loss of $477.7 million for the fourth quarter.=20

Calpine shares were down 6.26 percent yesterday apparently in reaction to n=
ews that Moody's had downgraded Calpine's unsecured debt from Ba1 to B1, al=
ong with a negative ratings outlook. Approximately $12.4 billion of long-te=
rm debt instruments are affected. This follows a March 29 report, when the =
company disclosed that it will restate 2001 earnings after the company disc=
overed that emission-reduction credits it had purchased last year were not =
actually available. In a press release, Calpine said 2001 earnings would be=
 lowered by $11.5 million after tax from the $659.6 million reported on Jan=
. 31. The restatement will drop 2001 diluted earnings per share after extra=
ordinary items by 3 cents a share, to $1.87.=20

Moody's sited several reasons for the ratings downgrades including Calpine'=
s high leverage, limited financial flexibility, and substantial ongoing cap=
ital expenditure requirements to complete its reduced build-out program. Ca=
lpine's debt is expected to grow over the coming year as the company contin=
ues its development of committed projects. While Calpine's total electric s=
ales are expected to increase as it completes additional plants, it is expe=
cted to be selling into unfavorable market conditions. Moody's anticipated =
that lower spark spreads (the difference between electric and fuel prices) =
will lower in the near term. Moody's warned that the negative outlook refle=
cts the possibility of additional downgrades should Calpine's liquidity pos=
ition further deteriorate or its cash flow fall below expectations. Calpine=
 plans to fund completion of 22 gas-fired power projects and 2 project expa=
nsions during 2002 and 2003. Moody's also assigned a Ba3 rating to Calpine'=
s $2 billion of senior secured credit facilities. According to Moody's, the=
 Ba3 rating reflects the benefits and limitations of Calpine's collateral p=
ackage. A portion of the collateral package consists of Calpine's equity in=
terests in Saltend and nine U.S. power plants. A principal part of the coll=
ateral package is Calpine's natural-gas properties, which may be subject to=
 fluctuation in value based on changes in reserves and gas prices. Moody's =
claims a portion of these gas reserves is not proven.=20

Mirant also continues to experience hard times. Its shares were down 6.21 p=
ercent to close at $13.60 per share. Although yesterday's downturn may have=
 largely been driven by the overall downturn in the sector, Mirant has been=
 involved in several interesting announcements this week as it continues to=
 try to shore up its balance sheet. On April 1 it was reported that Mirant =
has put its Kogan Creek power station and Wilkie Creel coal mine in Queensl=
and up for sale. Queensland's government-owned CS Energy, currently 40-perc=
ent owner of Kogan Creek, is reported to be a potential buyer, as are MIM a=
nd Macarthur Coal. In a separate transaction announced on March 27, Cleco a=
greed to buy Mirant's 50-percent interest in a 725-megawatt power plant the=
 companies are building in northeastern Louisiana. The merchant power plant=
 is owned by a joint venture between the two companies. Cleco said it would=
 assume Mirant's $19.5-million equity commitment and pay $48 million to ret=
ire Mirant's project debt. Cleco said it would finance the buyout with a co=
mbination of new common stock and debt.=20

AES has also fallen on tough times. Although the company's stock was up yes=
terday to close at $8.96 per share, the company continues to struggle. Earl=
y this week, AES sent a shockwave through the U.K. market when it announced=
 its decision to put its 363 MW Fifoots Point coal-fired power plant locate=
d in Wales into receivership. The recommissioning of Fifoots in late-1999 w=
as funded with a $214.5-million loan arranged and underwritten by Deutsche =
Bank. Richard Hill, joint administrative receiver at KPMG in London, who is=
 charged with selling the asset, says Fifoots has some GBP80 million of non=
-recourse bank debt obligations as well as other liabilities that have yet =
to be fully determined. Similar to the U.S. market, wholesale prices in the=
 U.K. reportedly have collapsed by 30 percent after the launch of last spri=
ng's new bilateral trading system. Accordingly, one report claims at least =
a dozen project loans are either in technical default, have broken their co=
venants, or are very close to not meeting their coverage ratio.=20

In other AES-related news this week it was announced that GE would be purch=
asing AESGener's 40-percent stake in the Servicios Integrales de Generacion=
 de Energia Electrica (Sigen) services company for an undisclosed amount. G=
E already owned 60 percent of the joint venture. AESGener, controlled by AE=
S, posted losses of Pesos $5,027mil in 2001 compared to a profit of Pesos $=
2,275mil in 2000. Operating results were down by 12.5 percent to Pesos $70,=
241mil on sales declining 23.8 percent to Pesos $347,009mil. The performanc=
e of AES' Argentinean subsidiaries TermoAndes and InterAndes, and selling o=
ff the subsidiaries Central Puerto and Puerto Ventanas imposed losses. Rece=
ntly appointed AESGener Chairman Roberto Morgan commented that the company =
will continue to divest in non-electric assets and assets not based in Chil=
e.=20

The fallout of the Enron debacle, lowered credit ratings, and weak commodit=
y prices are providing a 1-2-3 blow that has many energy companies on the r=
opes struggling to make the bell. The companies are aggressively working to=
 put up a defense by shoring up their balance sheets through asset sales, p=
ostponing or canceling projects and taking necessary write-offs. But as qui=
ckly as these companies' fortunes have nosedived, they can rise once again.=
 Such is the fickle nature of the commodity world.=20
