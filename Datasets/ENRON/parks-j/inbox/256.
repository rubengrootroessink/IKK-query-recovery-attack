Over the past few weeks, we have received numerous requests for information about changes to Enron's business policies and procedures since filing for bankruptcy, so we have developed REORIENTATION.  It's a short session designed for employees to outline current benefits and services, and to provide a better understanding of the bankruptcy process.  

Agenda items include:
- An update on the Credit Union
- A Legal Overview, including some things you should know about bankruptcy
- Status of the Enron Building, including space management, churns and building services
- A review of Employee Benefits
- A presentation from the Resolution Center
- An update on existing Employee Services
- An overview Employee Self Service, including how to access or change your own employee information

Each session will be held in EB5C2 from 9:00-10:30am, and is limited to 50 participants, so you must RSVP if you would like to attend.  Simply select a button above to indicate the date you would like to attend. The session dates are April 3rd, 10th and 11th.  You will then be sent a confirmation email.  The plan is to have one or two morning sessions weekly.  If you have a question about this program or a suggestion for a future program, please contact Rachael Tobor at 3-1481.
