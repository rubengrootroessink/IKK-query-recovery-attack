> Last week's 119 bcf injection into U.S. natural gas storage - the largest
> weekly injection since mid-June 1994 - leaves current storage of 1.077 tcf
> only 86 bcf below last year and 40 bcf from the middle of the 1994-1999
> range. Based on seasonal patterns, large injections should continue over
the
> next nine weeks, when storage increases are typically the largest of the
> year. So far this injection season, inventories have risen 450 bcf, or
100%
> faster than the typical rate of 220 over the first six weeks of the refill
> season. If inventories rise only half that rate, at 50% faster than the
> norm, storage would pass the middle of the typical range next week and end
> October at nearly 3 tcf, or 120 bcf from the top of the range.
>
> While our projected inventory injections seem bearish, we still look for
> relatively strong price support above $4/mmBtu through the year. Even with
> inventories rising quickly, there seems to be genuine concern for the need
> to satisfy summer demand for electricity (air conditioning), especially in
> the Southwest U.S. By the end of the year, however, we expect inventory
> coverage of forward demand to be on par with normal levels.
>
> While we continue to feel that demand has been a major contributor to the
> large storage injections, supply also seems to be playing a stronger role.
> Reported DOE growth of 3% in 2000, which comes with a one percentage point
> room for error due to data imperfections, comes mostly from Texas and
> Wyoming. From Canada, higher than expected production from Alberta, in
> addition to the eastern offshore, seems to have influenced the large
> shipments to the U.S. Contrary to expectation, the Alliance pipeline has
> been running at 1.5 bcf/d capacity - and often beyond - since its
> commencement last November.
