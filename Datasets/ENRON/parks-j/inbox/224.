Central Parking is currently working on the gated access system of the Allen Center Garage to improve its operation.  Over the next four to six weeks, the existing system will be replaced with new, improved technology.  In the meantime, Enron Property Services is working with Central Parking to develop a short term solution to improve access in and out of the garage.

If you experience a problem entering or exiting the garage with your access card, call Martin Katz at extension 59322.  Indicate where the problem occurred (Gold, Green or Blue Garage), whether it was upon entering or exiting, and the time of day the malfunction occurred.  This will enable Property Services to help Central Parking pinpoint the problem areas that should be addressed first.

If you currently use a transponder for entering or exiting the Allen Center Garage, please contact the Parking & Transportation desk at extension 37060.  Arrangements will be made to immediately replace your transponder with a new access card.  The transponder system is experiencing the majority of problems and will be taken out of service in the future.
