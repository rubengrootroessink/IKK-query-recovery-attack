What's the deal. No traffic all week. Makes coming to work really lame.

Here's something to talk about. Karnes City!!! Like it is time to cut checks 
again and mail them to the opielas before they call me and hit me up for a 
raise on our rent.

John:Last year looks like the break down was as follows: you wrote a ckedk 
to Rancho Grande Trust for 2,600 and collected from Mark and Matt.
I wrote one for 900 and collected from pig, shet, smack, hudge and senior 
saftey.

SO Brian, Chet, Chad, Hudge and Joe need to cut me a check for 150 a piece 
and mail it to my office 815 walker #1447 H/T 77002.

If you are not interested in getting back on, let me know so I can fill your 
spot.

John, mail your check and I will send off with mine and contract for emerick
