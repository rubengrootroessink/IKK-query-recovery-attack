Subject:	DEC. MRT GAS



ENA had a term supply contract with Energen to purchase roughly 4,485MMBTU a day at 2.60 on MRT, which Energen terminated on December the 4th, 2001.  The operator for the supply, Duke Field Services, erroneously allowed  supply to continue to flow between Dec. 4-31. ENA also failed to remove its nomination for the supply, allowing it to continue to flow to ENA's market, Oneok.  Duke Field Services would like to get paid for the gas it delivered and has offer to sell ENA the gas at a price of 2.3375 (gas daily average for MRT West Leg). 

I have spoken with David Eubanks in gas settlements and he shows ENA receiving and delivering the gas to Oneok.

 I would like to try to get the MRT issue settled as soon as possible, for I feel that it would help facilitate the Centana Storage account (approximately $2,500,000 in positive cash flow). Although Duke recognizes that it has no offset rights for the two issues, they seem to be taking their time.
