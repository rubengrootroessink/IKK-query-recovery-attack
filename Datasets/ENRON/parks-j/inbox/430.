Stacey,

This is what I provided you after the first meeting.  I know you are busy but did you get ever get a chance to review?  Please provide your comments as soon as possible so we can address Rick's question.

Thanks so much,

Eric

Right now, the plant is down and gas being purchased under contract is out of the money.  Joe Parks is reselling the gas that was scheduled going into the month to TXU and isn't dealing (yet) with the imbalance that was carried forward as a result of prior months' activity.  Ideally, he would cut back scheduled gas and start working off the imbalance.  Did we ever get a read on the PPEP supply/transport contracts in terms of flexibility to meet contract mins?
