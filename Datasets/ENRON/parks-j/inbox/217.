, among other documents identified in the Bankruptcy Court's February 15, 2=
002 Order, a copy of which you all have received by email, all documents th=
at relate to a pending or threatened investigation or lawsuit. As I am sure=
 you are aware from reading the newspapers and watching television, because=
 of the number of investigations and lawsuits the universe of relevant docu=
ments in just this one category covered by the Order is very large. You mus=
t retain all relevant company-related documents until these actual or threa=
tened lawsuits and investigations are over. No one can then second-guess wh=
ether you destroyed a relevant document. However, many of you have requeste=
d guidance on what must be retained in this category of documents. To that =
end, attached are the various subject matters of subpoenas and document req=
uests that we have received. While you should be sure to take the time to r=
