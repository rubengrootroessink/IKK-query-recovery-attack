Boy, am I glad we ran into Don Woo.  This bid looks unbelievably cheap.
These guys are super nice.  I think we should definitely consider them.
Give me a call and let me know what you think and I can go pick up samples
or we can go out there together so you can meet them.

Kim,

I hope Mano took care of you this afternoon.  He passed me the notes and I
have prepared a quote for you; it is attached.  Let me know if you have any
questions.
