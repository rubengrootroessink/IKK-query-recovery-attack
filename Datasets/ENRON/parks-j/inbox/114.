As previously announced, Enron has chosen WorldCom Conferencing as its preferred conferencing service provider. WorldCom can help us achieve our cost-saving objectives in conferencing, but your involvement is required. 
To Make a Reservation for Your Next Conference: 
Call 800-475-5000 
Provide your authorization code: 6160358 
Reserve on-line by using the Online Reservation System at <<http://e-meetings.wcom.com/>>. You can also modify, change, or cancel your conference by using this convenient tool.
Audio Conferencing - Whether you need to collaborate, exchange information or give a presentation, WorldCom's multi-featured audio conferencing service can help ensure that you meet and exceed your daily business goals. One of the quickest and most cost-effective ways to place a conference call is through a product called Instant Meeting. 
Instant Meeting is designed for small staff meetings, spontaneous events such as crisis management or to pull teams together for rapid decision-making. Many people use Instant Meeting for regularly recurring business meetings that don't require the intervention of a conference coordinator. 
Why use Instant Meeting? 
It's available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. 
You will save the administrative time spent setting up a reservation and distributing call information. 
WorldCom provides the same dial-in number (toll or toll-free) and pass codes for all meetings. 
There is secure password access and added security of separate leader and participant pass codes. 
You pay only for usage on Instant Meeting accounts of fewer than 20 ports. Larger port subscriptions carry a monthly fee in addition to usage (up to 100 ports available). 
For more sophisticated reservations, you can also use these other service levels: 
1)	Premier Service - Designed for high-visibility meetings, focus groups, press conferences, investor relations calls, presentations to large groups, or other events that require a dedicated meeting manager to handle your call from start to finish. 
2)	Standard Service - Designed for meetings with medium-sized groups, such as trainings or project management meetings. 
3)	Unattended Service - Designed for small internal meetings, such as staff or team meetings. 
Other services available from WorldCom Conferencing: 
1)	Video Conferencing - Video Conferencing provides businesses with all the advantages of face-to-face interaction and saves money on travel expenses. 
2)	Net Conferencing - Net Conferencing takes your meetings to the Internet and enhances your audio-only calls by adding a visual element to your meetings. With this Internet-based service, you can bring people to an environment that allows them to share and review information. 
To help you learn more about WorldCom's services, a WorldCom Conferencing Field Specialist, Torri Rhodes, has arranged a training seminar. Please RSVP for this seminar by replying to torri.rhodes@wcom.com <mailto:torri.rhodes@wcom.com>.
