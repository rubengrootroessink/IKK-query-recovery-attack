Men:
Sending Emrick and Elaine checks and contract for 2001 today. John is
re-upping with Mark and Matt for the dove/deer stuff and sent me a check for
their 2,600 payable to Rancho Grande trust. I have cut a check for 900 for
the dove lease people at 150 a piece bringing our total lease price to
3,500.
I'm assuming Emrick will sign the lease and cash the checks as he does every
june.
Dove boys can cut their checks for 150 to me and mail or hand deliver.
thanks, e.
