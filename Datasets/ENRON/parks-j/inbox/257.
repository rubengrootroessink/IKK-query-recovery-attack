Shemin,

Attached are the wiring instructions.  Also, we will need a W-9 form
from
Centana Intrastate Pipeline Company.  Do you need one faxed to you?

I can accept faxed signature pages and I will fax my signature once the
parties have signed first.  Please forward an original agreement  to us.

As mentioned, due to the holiday, we will need to have funds wired by
1:00
CST for funds to be invested.  Our fees are $4,250.00.

(See attached file: Wire.doc)

Please call me at (713) 216-6467 if you have any questions.

May
