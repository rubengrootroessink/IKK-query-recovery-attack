Joe:

The GISB contracts for TXU are acceptable. I'm filling in the blanks and waiting for Theresa Vos to send me some info. Left a message for Tim Powell stating that I should have these contracts back to him by today. Regarding an invoice, Theresa will prepare it but how much gas did we sell TXU? Price? etc. Or do I get that from Tim??
