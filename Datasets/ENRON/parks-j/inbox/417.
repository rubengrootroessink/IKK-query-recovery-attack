Subject: OCP Update



As of this morning, Weil  informs that the court has not yet approved the o=
rder for theordinary course professionals, so even the original list of ven=
dors that has been before the court for upwards of a month is not approved.=
   Weil says that the court might approve the order today, but we just have=
 to wait and see. Once the court issues the order, the vendors still must c=
omplete a form of affidavit to submit to the court to complete the process.=
 We have not yet been given the form of affidavit.

I attach the following:

1.  original list of vendors that is before the court for approval (doc "58=
#s02!.doc")

2. the current supplement list of proposed vendors, which has not been subm=
itted to the court so far as I know, but which has been approved by the int=
ernal bankruptcy management committee for submission to the court (doc "sup=
plement matrix 020702 marked.doc")

3. a grid for you to complete and send back to to me if you want to get add=
itional law firms or other professionals (engineers, accountants, appraiser=
s, other professional persons) approved, or if you want to send additional =
assignments to an OCP on the existing lists, as the OCP's apparently get ap=
proved for specific limited scopes. The criteria so far on for OCP's, subje=
ct to whatever the aproved order will say, is that the OCP is limited to a =
monthly budgte of $50k over an average of 6 months, and no more than $500k =
per case.  If you  think your budget will exceed that, then we need to talk=
. Depending on what Weil says, I would think the work should either be give=
n to an existing specially retained profession or, if they can't handle the=
 job due to expertise issues, perhaps another specially retained profession=
al filing will nbeed to ne made.=20

In addition to filing out the grid, the bankruptcy management committee wil=
l require that you be able to state thenew OCP you propose is not a related=
 party (Enron and affilaited persons/parties do not have ecomonic interests=
 in the proposed OCP, and vice versa). You should do that in your e-mail tr=
ansmitting the completed grid back to me. (doc "OCP supplement addition gri=
d.doc")
