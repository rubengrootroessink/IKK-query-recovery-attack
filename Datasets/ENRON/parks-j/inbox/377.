HOURLY ANDDAILY BALANCE, both positive and negative
Importance: High


ALL SHIPPERS MUST REMAIN IN HOURLY AND DAILY BALANCE.  All penalties will
apply, both on the positive and negative balances. Do not exceed a rate of
your daily nomination divided by 24, and do not exceed other limitations
imposed by gas control, if applicable.  Please call your representative if
there are any questions.

Due to system constraints all Shippers must stay within contract swing
limits.

Imbalance makeup may be scheduled with prior approval from your
Transportation Administrator.

In our ongoing effort to keep TXU Lone Star Pipeline customers aware of
current Daily Available Capacity on our system, TXU Lone Star Pipeline is
pleased to provide you an estimate of available capacity on the TXU Lone
Star Pipeline system.  This is a Microsoft Excel document.  Simply click on
