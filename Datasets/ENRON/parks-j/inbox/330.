Hi Joe,
I received Mike Richards' comments. Other than word changes which he and
I had discussed there are three changes that I need to discuss with you:
(1) an agreement between the parties to work in good faith to resolve
the pre-bankruptcy storage fees and file for bankruptcy approval within
30 days (don't worry about the bankruptcy angle, just the business
side); (2) instead of "as is" language, no warranty as to fitness for
intended use, ordinary use or a particular purpose; and (3) potential
offset with other post-petition costs. Give me a call-5-3910.
