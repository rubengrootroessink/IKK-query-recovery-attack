Man, you're not supposed to ask for money on a Friday afternoon!!  Save that
for Mondays!

Anybody up for RUSH?!?!?  Coming Friday August 16th.  Could be a blast from
the past.  We can act like teenagers again, although the recovery could take
all weekend.  I'll need to try and find my old "NUGENT" concert shirt I wore
for my entire 8th grade year to truly replicate my teenage years.

What's the deal. No traffic all week. Makes coming to work really lame.

Here's something to talk about. Karnes City!!! Like it is time to cut checks

again and mail them to the opielas before they call me and hit me up for a 
raise on our rent.

John:Last year looks like the break down was as follows: you wrote a ckedk 
to Rancho Grande Trust for 2,600 and collected from Mark and Matt. I wrote
one for 900 and collected from pig, shet, smack, hudge and senior 
saftey.

SO Brian, Chet, Chad, Hudge and Joe need to cut me a check for 150 a piece 
and mail it to my office 815 walker #1447 H/T 77002.

If you are not interested in getting back on, let me know so I can fill your

spot.

John, mail your check and I will send off with mine and contract for emerick

KCLN
