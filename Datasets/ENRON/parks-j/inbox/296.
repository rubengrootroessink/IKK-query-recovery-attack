Here are the files containing in-the-money live position data.  There are 4 files : 2002 monthly, 2003 monthly, 2004 monthly and 2005 out yearly.  The summary information is on the "Financial Book Positions" tab.
 
I did not consolidate them into one report just in case you needed to look at the supporting information.
 
The physical files should be ready within the next few minutes.
 
Let me know if you have questions.
