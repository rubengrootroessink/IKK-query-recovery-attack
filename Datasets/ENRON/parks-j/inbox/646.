RRRIIIGGHHTTTT!  reporting I was absolutely FUUUUUZZY! the next day.....could be the extracurricular mini-man-night Joe & I performed at the "Roll-N" at the tracks..oh yeah, I had to start smoking again too...just not my week to stop sniffing glue.     what?

Fish products(incl. eye): Yummy
Red fish dip: agreed on the thick V-8, of course we gringos have always been accused of over-doing Mex. fair, hence Tex-Mex, Pappasitos has made millions over doing Mex food.
Beer(XX): abundant
Service: attentive!! "Uno mas Cervesa por favor senorita!"  ..and she did.
The others:  perfect entertainment despite the "partner's" everpresent nervous grimace.

Glad to see Chompers out!  I say lets invite one other individual every time that we can disturb--kinda like a deer lease interview.

All in all, good venture, I think I have put most of the fish back in the water by now.

C.

Ok...I thought the addition of "life partners" to the table simply intensified the revelry normally associated with "Man Night"...                 it was like the testosterone crescendoed to its normal Deer-lease range once the "other side" joined our fray. Up until that point, I thought everyone's mini-meetings regarding isolated work-related gibberish was very non Man-like, almost to the point of boredom. Thank God "They" arrived b/c they brought out the best in the "Men".

It was either that or the $190.00 worth of alcoholic beverages that did it.

RE: The food...

Salsa was uninspired...but had good bite.
Queso is queso when doctored with proper amounts of capsicum, thus pushing the Scoville Units up to an acceptable level.
Mexican Seafood Cocktail...Good effort at the traditional version, albeit the least adventuresome. They make one that has shrimp,crab, octopus, squid, fish, etc. that would have gone over even better with the organ meat eaters. Does not compare to Goode Co.'s version, which is Tex-Mex'ized. Must be why Joe thought it was Ketchup....This version,  which I have eaten in Mexico is nothing more than Ceviche'ized random seafood, Pico, and the Mexican equivalent of V8 juice. Served with lime wedges and saltine crackers, like the natives do it.

Fish and Shrimp Main Course....Thought the fish was exceptionally fresh and tasty. Enjoyed the "Diablo" version the best w/ the corn tortillas and Guacamole. Very unique item seldom seen on menus. Would go back just for that. The shrimp suffered from too long in the fryer disease. It needs to be started in the fryer, cooked 1/4 of the way to render the bacon fat away, then finished over a char-grill to give it a smoky flavor. That step seemed to have been left out...fryer the whole time. They probably don't even have a char-grill.

Ritas- "Rocas" were good, Frozen was non-descript. Dos XX reliable as always. Perhaps we will get Michaladas next time, as discussed.
Overall...I'd go back, like I said, just for that fish!!!!

OUT

Had fun. Glad to see everyone at the Hybrid man night. Reported to Zander,  
who was glad to hear we enjoyed the food. Joe that was not a TV dinner.
We still need to take care of the deer lease food/beer issues. ....whenever.
FYI John (Wollam) is fine. Has a pulled muscle in his neck.
Enjoyed eating eyes, eye socket fatty tissue, head meat, talking about how  
much I care for my dog, eating heart meat, men playing with their meat,  
bowel distress and "grapes" and seeing how it played out for the one MAN  
audience.
I doubt Dave Wieland will join us again and Ted will likely be asked to turn  
down the next invitation to join us by his friend.
I give the food an A+, service was also excellent. Chad gets the award for  
being most "in" to the effort.
I will mark my calendar for 60 days to rip a thread for the next effort. e.
