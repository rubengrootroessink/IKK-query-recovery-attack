Greg,

No problem. I'm attaching this morning's basic for you. If you want, we can
keep those products coming to you regularly this week as a free trial until
you've decided.

Take care,

Matt

Greg,

Good morning. Enron was paying for a pretty large weather package from us,
so it may be a steep cost to get the entire package. Were there just certain
products you were using? For example, our basic package, which includes the
1-15 day maps, the 16-city forecasts, the 30-day outlook, and phone access
is $450/month. The noon update would be an additional $150/month. Since you
are a smaller group, I can apply a discount as well...perhaps as much as
20%. Let me know what products you were using from the site and I can put
together a package and quote for you fairly quickly. I'm attaching our
standard price sheet for your reference as well.

Take care,

Matt Rogers

Matt,


My name is Greg Schockling and I work for Bridgeline Gas Marketing, a
parternship between Chevron/Texaco and Enron.  We previously received your
energy weather via Enron and effective the 5th we stopped receiving it.  I
was wondering what you wouyld charge for us to pick up the service.  Weare a
small shop of 5 traders, we operate a pipeline in Louisiana and want to
continue the service.


Can you quote me what the cost would be to continue the service.  My phone
nummber is 832-851-2806.


Thanks


Greg Schockling
