Two cowboys from Texas walk
into a roadhouse to wash the
trail dust from their throats.
They stand at the bar,
drinking a beer and talking
about current cattle prices.
Suddenly, a woman at a nearby
table, who is eating a sandwich,
begins to cough.
After a minute or so, it becomes
apparent that she is in real distress.
One of the cowboys looks at her
and say, "kin ya swaller?"
The woman shakes her head, no.
"Kin ya breathe?"
The woman begins to turn blue
and shakes her head.
The cowboy walks over to the woman,
lifts up the back of her dress,
yanks down her panties, and slowly
runs his tongue from the back
of her thigh up to the small
of her back.
The woman is so shocked, that
she has a violent spasm and the
obstruction flies out of her mouth.
As she begins to breathe again,
the cowboy walks slowly back to the
bar and takes a drink from his beer.
His partner says,
"Ya know, I'd heard of that there
"Hind Lick Maneuver, but ain't
never seen nobody do it."
