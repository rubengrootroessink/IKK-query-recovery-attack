Men:

The dreaded time has come. Rent goes up and it is a month earlier.
The initial $8,000 payment is due to Mertz on March 1, 2002.

In addition, I paid Mertz $500 for the protien that he fed during the last 
hunting season.

I need each of you to forward me a check for $1,071.42. Send to 815 walker, 
suite 1447, H/T 77002. Thank you.

Erik.
