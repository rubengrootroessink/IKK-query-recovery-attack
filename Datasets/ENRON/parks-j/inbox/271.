        I don't normally make the nom. & I would suggest that we follow the format that you
        have outlined.  We do need to incorporate the Recoupment Agreement now with NNG
        which has not been executed as of yet   I'm having to work through attorney's to get 
        confirmation that we can execute.  
 
        I don't believe Joe has a market to sell the gas into.  The nom needs to be made with
        NNG so that we account for and capture the gas payment whether it's to be sold or just
        used to offset some of the imbalance.

This was put on Doug's desk @ 7:30 this morning.  Let's hope it clears!  
 
Were you going to submit the Hubbard nom or did you want me to?  Is everyone clear that even though we make the nom, we are not going to sell the gas?

Hey guys,
I'm showing that we have a payment due to NNG for $4,179 on Thursday, but don't have the request.  Could you get it to me this morning.
Thanks,
