Great to hear from you!  We've been ragging on you all week for not giving us a call!  Things are start to move a bit more.  It looks like they are getting ready to auction some live contracts and I have my first meeting regarding settling terminated contracts this afternoon.  We haven't heard about retentions, but it should be any day now since I've heard that some people in risk were told this morning.  

Troy wants to know what your title is, so give him a holler when you get the chance.  We have also been wondering why your Instant Messenger always says that you are away.  You need to get that fixed.  

Thanks for the phone number and we'll definitely keep in touch!

Kathy
