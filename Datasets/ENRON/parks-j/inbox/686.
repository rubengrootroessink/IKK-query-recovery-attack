Think this a great idea...he is just the ideal person to have on the lease and as standup and nice of a guy you would ever want to know. I'd give him a bid right away!!!

Deer All:

I have a person that might fit what we are looking for in the 8th spot or to 
fill a gap left by Joe (who is currently unable to provide a firm response).

B.J. Johnson. Played football with Chad and I at Jesuit. Was a year a head 
of us. Met Zander at UH in College and hung with he and Brian while they 
were rooming together. Went to lawschool a few years after me. Is out and 
doing well with at a well known plaintiff's lawfirm.
Nice guy. He mentioned a year or so ago to call him if we ever had a spot. 
His dad used to take him hunting and BJ wants to return the favor. Looking 
for a place he could take his dad once or twice a year, just to get out 
there not to shoot deer. He has two small girls, is busier than I am and 
would go no more than the rest of the Houston boys.

He is a good guy. Don't know much about his deer hunting experience, but I 
don't care about that.

Chad and Brian give him the stamp of approval. My thought is we could 
proceed as set with Chris and I splitting the 8th spot, but if Joe winds up 
taking a job out of state (which is a possibility) we would be left with two 
spots to fill and less time to do it. I think it might be best to offer this 
spot to BJ and fill up all 8 spots, then if we lose Joe, Chris and I can be 
the fall back plan.

Thoughts and comments from the McComb guys please.


Erik.
