Shemin, attached below is your last draft of the letter agreement with our
additional comments.  Some of the comments we previously discussed on the
phone.  I understand my business person is having discussions with Enron
management to try and resolve a number of issues with Enron.  Therefore,
the results of those discussions may cause additional comments from us to
this Letter Agreement..  In addition, my business person is currently out
of the office, so these comments are subject to his review and additional
changes.  We are fine with the Escrow Agreement as long as it is understood
that Enron will pay all costs associated with the Escrow Agreement.
