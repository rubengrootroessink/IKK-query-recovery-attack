All, I'm outa here headed to White river for some fly fishing w/ Brad.  We'll be there thru Sat morning.  We got plenty of room if any of you get thrown out of the house this week!  Just BYOB (bring your own banjo).  We'll be hangin' w/ the toothless, web-footed, banjo-playin' locals.
 
This is where we'll be:
