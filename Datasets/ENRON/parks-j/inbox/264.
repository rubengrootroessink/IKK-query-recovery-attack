Attached you will find minor revisions to these agreements marked in red.
CIPCO is now an LLC so we have reflected it that way in the agreement.  We
also filled in information for the blanks.  Otherwise, everything looks
great.  Also, for your information, Brian S. Frederick, Vice President,
will sign the letter and escrow agreement for CIPCO.  CIPCO's tax ID # is
84-1484857.  I filled in the contact information for the Escrow Agreement.
Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.
