Later today, the SCADA system and associated databases used to run our pipeline will be cut over from St. Rose to Hayes Road. The move should be largely transparent to us. Energy and volumetric data for yesterday should be unaffected.
 
However, as with any significant change, there is a chance for unexpected problems. We will be monitoring the cutover and working with ChevronTexaco to help ensure a smooth transition. We will inform you if unexpected problems develop that affect pipeline control or data availability and integrity.
 
If you access the SCADA applications home page, note that the address is changing from <http://144.5.254.33/> to <http://144.5.254.92>.
 
Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.
 
Thanks,
