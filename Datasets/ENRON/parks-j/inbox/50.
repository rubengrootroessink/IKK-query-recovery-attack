Joe,  thanks for the info.....interesting "stuff" in here.   Glad you landed okay.  Good to hear from you.  Hope everything continues to go well for you in your new job.   "Scary" stuff going on in the industry right now....The attorney general's office is filing suit, tomorrow I think.  press release is being finalized as I am writing....  I hope we end up nameing Louise Kitchen and getting some of her compensation back!!!  I suspect we'll be fighting this ordeal for a while now..

Life is very good to me here....love my job, my home, and being in Austin.  Say hello to Dee Hagy for me...

Hello, Linda. How are things? I have attached a document that contains a list that shows the amount of money paid out to traders before the Dynegy merger. I thought you would like to see it. It is on page 75 of the pdf file.

Joe
