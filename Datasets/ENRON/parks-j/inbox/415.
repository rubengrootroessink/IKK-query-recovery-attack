Hi Chris,
Thank you for the information. I was not aware that CIPCO had asserted
that ENA's pre-petition claims were secured by a statutory lien; I was
aware of their setoff and recoupment claims and those are both reflected
in the draft letter agreeement.

Per my earlier message.  Sorry for the delay.  I am providing this for
info. only.....no action on your part required.  As I understand from
Joe Parks, you will be working on the deal documents.  This is a summary
of the deal we are seeking to close.
