How about this?  It may be too formal, but I don't know how well you know
this guy.  Call me before you send it.

Paul,

Thanks for forwarding my resume to Tom.  I met with him and several other
nice people over there this afternoon.  They seem like a great group to work
with.  The position sounds very interesting and like it would be a good
opportunity.  Hopefully, something will work out.  Again, I really
appreciate your efforts.  

Joe
