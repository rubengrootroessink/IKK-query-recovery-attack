Has anyone figured out who Erik talked to Friday afternoon...apparently
he had a conversation with a person who he thought was me...you know,
typical "man" talk. I called him and asked him where he was (lots of
noise in the background, beer bottles clinking, women hootin' and
hollerin', etc.). His reply was, "Whaddayamean...I'm at the same place
as the last time you asked me that." (Bar) I said , Erik, I havent
talked to you all day> He said, "Really...well I had a conversation for
about 10 minutes with someone I thought was you about an hour ago".
Nope, wasnt me!!! "I guess it was Chad, then. With all this noise (Bar),
It is difficult to hear (that combined with apparent beer drinking,
added to his confusion) I called Chad moments later to find out what the
conversation between Erik and "I" was....he verified, as well, that he
had not talked to him, either!!!
	Now, this is funny. Can you imagine what the conversation was
like for the poor bastard on the other end of the line who E thought was
me? 
Example...Pig references, references to drinking, large breasted bar
"ho's", shooting and eating things, snide, disparaging remarks intended
to disempower, and large amounts of colorful metaphors. 
	I certainly hope that Erik was talking to one of us, and not
some prospective client or business associate. This could be a SNL skit,
if done correctly!!!
Pretty damn funny....

I'm planning on going this weekend. Who else?  Hudge?  

The birds I've seen behind this cold front are not lacking in speed or
agility.  Thinking its time for the 12 ga. (can't shoot my 20 worth a
#@!
anyway).

Where's Major?

Had a nice weekend with the family down at KC.
Wrapped up a deposition in San Antonio at at about 1, eat and headed to
KC. 
Arrived at about 4. shot limit at 100 acres. Not alot of birds, but
enough. 
Birds very wise. Had to hide well. Lots of birds across the road feeding
in 
the field, lots hanging out on wire. few moving over our ponds.
Saw lots of coyotes. 4 at 100acres, two at 500.
heavy rain at 7 pm. cool front.
Sheila came down with boys on sat. caught a few fish at 100 acres, shot
7 
birds. Suprised many still in area with rain and north wind. Harder to
hide 
with two wiggling boys.
Never got to scout 500 acres, by mark hunted it last weekend according
to 
his note and shot only two birds. I saw a decent number in the area of 
between our gate and road to Opiela's house. The field across the road
from 
the front gate is stacked with sunfowers. They have not dropped seed
yet, 
still yellow. in a week or so, could draw birds. still lots feeding
across 
road from 100 acres.
John, saw a few deer tracks around your feeders, and lots of really big
pig 
tracks.
If someone is going down in the next two weeks, please let me know. I
left a

pistol at the house, Ms. Opiela went over and got it for me. She will
hold 
onto it until I can get some one to pick it up.
