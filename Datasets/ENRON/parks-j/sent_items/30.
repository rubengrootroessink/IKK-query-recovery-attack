Dear PIRA Client:

You have been provided with access to PIRA Online, PIRA's comprehensive Internet-based energy library, as part of the Retainer Service that your company has with PIRA Energy Group. PIRA Online provides you with access to our latest reports as well as a searchable archive of past reports and additional data tables and charts.

Please note that your account may take up to 30 minutes to be activated.

To access the online service, please go to our website at www.pira.com <http://www.pira.com/>. Once you enter the site, go to the top right corner of the home page and click on "Retainer Client Login" to enter the Client section. You will be prompted for your User Name and Password, which are listed below.

User Name: jparks
Password: jp11280

NOTE: These letters are case-sensitive.

Once you have entered the Client section, you have three choices for accessing your information. In the center of the page we list PIRA's latest 10 reports for those fuels sectors to which you have access (e.g. Global Oil, North American Gas, Electricity, and European Natural Gas); on the left is an option to go directly to the most recent issue of the main reports for any of these fuel markets; and at the top of the page you may select "Latest" to retrieve PIRA reports issued over the last 30 days by fuel, or "All Reports" to retrieve all PIRA reports (archived and recent) by fuel.

If you have any questions about your retainer, or if you are having a problem logging on to PIRA Online, please contact:
