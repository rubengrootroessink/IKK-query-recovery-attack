Ed,wants me to get this deal closed. I spoke with Stuart and he would like your opinion on using the proceeds from the sale to cover the expense of the MRT gas. He seems to think it shouldn't be an issue given that ENA is counterparty to both. Of course we would need to add language that would require Centana to show that it has paid Duke Field. Lets Discuss.
