I am in a meeting all day Friday...can be packed and ready to go by 5:30
pm...keep in mind I live in Spring now!!! I was gonna go 290 through
Austin to get to lease. Would like to consider taking two cars b/c of
the "emergency" issue that always seems to pop up (what with sick kids
and all)and/or break down issues, theres a back up vehicle to help
transport in that scenario.

Joe and Brian: my favorite case may require that I work a full day on
Friday 
and leave with Brian friday afternoon. If I need to do that, I would
greatly 
appreciate it if Joe would agree to stop by the golf cart place to pick
up 
the new batteries. Please let me know if this is agreeable joe. e.
