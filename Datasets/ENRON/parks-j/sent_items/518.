Let me know as soon as you can on "Seterdey" -- Molly's been getting pissed
at me since I won't tell her if I'm really going or not.

Technology is not quite where it needs to be yet. I s/b able to simply
think
about moving $$ and making an investment, as I don't seem to have time
these
days to get online and do it!  I just watch the virtual gains slip
away...

By the way, I'm still looking to get out to KC this weekend, but I can't
seem to figure out what the weather is going to do.  The San Antonio
forecast looks different than KC's, so I can't tell what the chances of
rain
are on Friday and Saturday.  Want to make sure it's worth while.  What
do
the "models" say?

Of course, if you don't go, I'll probably blow it off anyway (no
pressure).
