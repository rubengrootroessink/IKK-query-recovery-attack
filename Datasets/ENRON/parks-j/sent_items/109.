Greg,

Good morning. I really apologize about yesterday. The webmaster decided to
tighten up the web address and it is now:


www.earthsat.com/misc/bridge

login: bridge
password: cajun

It all should work fine now. Sorry for the confusion on our part.

Take care,

Matt

No, I can set you up on the web this afternoon and we can call this next
week your free trial!

I'll send info to our web support right now. It should be up late this
afternoon or tomorrow morning.

Let's do this:

www.earthsat.com/misc/bridgeline

login: bridge
password: cajun

Please use all lower case, since it will be cap-sensitive.

I'll be out of the office tomorrow, but I'll have someone checking my e-mail
if you have any problems with the website.

The webmaster is Darren Prager (dprager@earthsat.com).

Thanks again!!

Matt

Matt,

The contract looks fine, my only question is do we have to wait till the
20th to get web access?  Just explain to me when we can begin receiving the
service.

Thanks again,

Greg Schockling

Greg,

Good afternoon. I'm attaching a contract agreement, which includes a
discount for the smaller number of users. Please let me know if you have any
questions or concerns regarding the contract.  Otherwise, please sign and
fax back to (301)231-5246 or 5020 at your earliest convenience.

Thanks again!

Matt

Greg,

Unfortunately not. That service is a hybrid that we offer to both our
clients and theirs. The cost for the service is $6600/year. You may want to
check with PIRA on your arrangement with them, but typically this is sold
separately.

I'll put a contract together for you with the basic, noon, and an applied
discount to account for your group's smaller size.

Thanks!

Matt

Matt,

Heres what I think we need here at Bridgeline, the basic service plus the
noon update, 1 page.  I also had a question, does this package include the
forecast on storage from pira?  We are a Pira client already so I just need
clarification on that.


Let me know then we'll finalize.

Thanks very much.

Greg,

No problem. I'm attaching this morning's basic for you. If you want, we can
keep those products coming to you regularly this week as a free trial until
you've decided.

Take care,

Matt

Greg,

Good morning. Enron was paying for a pretty large weather package from us,
so it may be a steep cost to get the entire package. Were there just certain
products you were using? For example, our basic package, which includes the
1-15 day maps, the 16-city forecasts, the 30-day outlook, and phone access
is $450/month. The noon update would be an additional $150/month. Since you
are a smaller group, I can apply a discount as well...perhaps as much as
20%. Let me know what products you were using from the site and I can put
together a package and quote for you fairly quickly. I'm attaching our
standard price sheet for your reference as well.

Take care,

Matt,


My name is Greg Schockling and I work for Bridgeline Gas Marketing, a
parternship between Chevron/Texaco and Enron.  We previously received your
energy weather via Enron and effective the 5th we stopped receiving it.  I
was wondering what you wouyld charge for us to pick up the service.  Weare a
small shop of 5 traders, we operate a pipeline in Louisiana and want to
continue the service.


Can you quote me what the cost would be to continue the service.  My phone
nummber is 832-851-2806.


Thanks


Greg Schockling
