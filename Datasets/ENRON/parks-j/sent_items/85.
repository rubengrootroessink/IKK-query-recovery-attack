Please reboot your machine at the end of the day today.  Otherwise you will have problems with your CQG in the morning.
If this will be a problem, please reply and we will find a workaround.


Thanks for you help.

The following people have been migrated to the new CQG infrastructure but have not logged out.  Could you have someone in desktop support, visit these users and have them logout after trading today.

Thanks,

Danielle
