You need to let me know if you want to sell volumes. I have to find a market.  Nominations are due Thursday afternoon.

	I've asked Joe to look for a market & get me a notional price.  If we have gas it will be
	15,000 mmbtu for the month.  I have calls into Royster to see if they want this gas
	for April.  My guess is that they won't.

What's the game plan?  Let me know so I can work with Joe.  Or you may want to talk to him yourself.
