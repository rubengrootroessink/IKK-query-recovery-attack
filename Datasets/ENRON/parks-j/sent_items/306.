Hey, Stuart is recommending we proceed without hearing from Duke. Could you send me a copy of what you have. Any questions, give me a call 3-9636

Hi Joe, 
I am waiting to hear back from Centana's attorney. As soon as I hear
from him (re escrow account duties and required contract provisions) and
make any necessary revisions, I will forward the document to you.
