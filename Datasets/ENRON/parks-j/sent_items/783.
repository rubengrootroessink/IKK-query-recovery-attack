The Lord works in wonderful ways.
My dear opposing counsel failed to appear at docket call this morning for 
our December 3rd, 2001 trial setting on the case you have heard me talk 
about so much.
The court dismissed their case for want of prosecution on the spot for no 
showing. While they have 30 days to try to get the case reinstated, the 
bottom line is that I will not have trial looming over my head while we hunt 
and you will not have to listen to me drone on about this ridiculous case 
(unless you want me to and at least for now).
Sincerely, Lawyer Boy.
