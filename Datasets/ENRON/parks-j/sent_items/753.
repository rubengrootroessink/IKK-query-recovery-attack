that is a really bad wind for many blinds. mertz called this am. has not 
seen a big buck he say in the bull pasture since last week. COuple of young 
deer, one good looking young 8. Lots of deer eating protien at booger. Has 
not seen them, but feed disappearing quick. wants us to shoot some deer out 
of that front pasture. Good rub (big) seen by tank at booger. says you can't 
miss it. has seen some decent pre-rut activity this week.
There is another good buck in the robertson pasture. He saw it crossing the 
oil field road last week. big body, 5 points on the side he saw, good mass.


Brian should be trying to organize a menu. He will procure keg of bud light 
if mccombs get the "kegerator". McCombs, stay posted.
I have lots of paper plates and paper coffe cups. I believe we have plenty 
of paper towels.

Looking forward to seeing everyone there.
