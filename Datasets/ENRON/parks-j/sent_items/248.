We currently do not have the curve information you need. Further, the curves I looked at in your spread sheet do not look good.

Paul -

Could you please get 3 broker quotes for the volumes & locations in the spreadsheet below ?

We need the quotes for the purposes of validating our internal curves and making E&Y more comfortable with our OXY valuation.

Thank You.

Alex
