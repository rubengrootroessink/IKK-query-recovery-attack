I don't like my odds on finding another.
 Let me know when you finish reviewing their comments. I will contact them about the sale, if we are ok with it.

Our bank is a done deal and just waiting for us. 
Good luck finding a buyer, Joe. That would be great.

Lets use whatever bank is easier. Wish me luck on finding someone else
to buy this gas. Lets hope we don't have to go that route.

Just an update. I spoke with Mike Richards and later today he will send
me the rest of his comments so that we can be ready to finalize the deal
if Greg returns and is ready to pull the trigger. 

Mike inquired of their bank and apparently they can open an escrow
account with slightly lower fees. Mike thinks the difference is about
$1500. Given the lack of control over the process and the fact that we
have an escrow account already finalized, I told him that I didn't think
ENA was interested in their opening another account, but I wanted to
check with you Joe.

Last, I checked and there is no jeopardy from a bankruptcy perspective
of finding a new buyer for the gas in the event that Centana declines to
move forward.
