Joe,
I spoke with Centana's attorney. According to him, they are not opposed
to the escrow account, just the hassle of paper work, but he is checking
with his commercial person and will get back to me today. I told him ENA
wants to do the deal, ENA is willing to open the escrow account, but
that's the deal. So I expect to hear from him shortly.

Attached is the email from Centana's attorney. At the very beginning of
Mike Richards' email he lists all of his claims.

Kay,  Mark is aware of this transaction.  The following is his response
to Centana's counsel email.  I did discuss with Mark this morning, the
current course we are following with Centana and he agreed it made
sense.  

As it stands now we would sell all the gas in-place to Centana and they
would net out post-petition fees.  Our business people feel that we have
used the storage services post-petition and consequently those fees
would be an administrative expense.  An amount equivalent to the
pre-petition fees would be held in escrow until the bankrutpcy court
resolved the pre-petition amounts.   All remaining amounts would be
delivered to Enron North America.
