This is cute!  Two down (Maria and Ted) and one to go (Chuck).  Current
status is red, puffy eyes and runny nose.  This is not easy.


The following ad is reported to have gotten numerous calls...


SINGLE BLACK FEMALE... Seeks male companionship, ethnicity
unimportant. I'm a svelte good looking girl who LOVES to play.
I love long walks in the woods, riding in your pickup truck,
hunting, camping, and fishing trips, cozy winter nights lying by
the fire. Candlelight dinners will have me eating out of your
hand. Rub me the right way and watch me respond.
I'll be at the front door when you get home from work, wearing
only what nature gave me. Kiss me and I'm yours.
Call xxx-xxxx and ask for Daisy.
Callers found themselves talking to the local Humane Society
about an eight-week-old black Lab.
