Ed,
    Below are some comments on the deals I have been working. 
 
 Duke/Centana 
  Money wires will be complete on April 1.  The proceeds from the transaction were received on Friday and the money that needs to be put into escrow will be sent out Monday, April 1.  I have created a folder o:\gas structuring\centana duke, where I have put the files for the cash request forms, wire transfer forms and the mini- DASH. There is also a cashflow.xls that explains the calculations for the dollars. I also have a file on my desk. The commercial contact for Duke Field Services was Greg Swedinsky 713-627-6265. In order to finish the transaction, a decision needs to made with respect to the contract and a settlement on pre-petition dollars. 

[Parks, Joe]  Ponderosa Energy Partners
 I have been helping Rick Hill and Chuck Ward manage the supply for the Tenaska IV power plant.   I have created a folder o:\gas structuring\tenaskaIV where  I have put files relevant to the project. The file PPEP2.doc are some of my notes that I think will be helpful to whom ever takes it over.
 
Pace Energy
I have a letter from Pace that explains what actions they have taken. The dollar figures are less than $100,000.
 
General Land Office.
I have a file that contains a copy of the contract between GLO and ERAC and a copy of an internal dealsheet for the natural gas volumes.
