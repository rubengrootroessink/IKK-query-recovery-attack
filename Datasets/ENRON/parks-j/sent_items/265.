Just because I had work to do, I once again lose. I need an office job.

I hereby accept my great nomination in the name of my country.

Just a couple of questions, Joe.

	1) Who is Jerry Burt?
	2) What is his number?
	3) I thought someone on the Enron side was trying to put together the volumes and prices??
