1 star hangover (*)

No pain. No real feeling of illness. Your sleep last night was a mere disco
nap which is giving you a whole lot of misplaced energy.  Be glad that you
are able to function relatively well.   However,you are still parched. You
can drink 10 sodas and still feel this way.  You are craving a steak bomb
and a side of gravy fries.



2 star hangover (**)

No pain, but something is definitely amiss. You may look okay but you have
mental capacity of a staple gun. The coffee you chug is only acerbating
your
rumbling gut, which is craving a rootie tootie fresh and fruity pancake
breakfast from IHOP. Last night has wreaked havoc on your bowels.



3 star hangover (***)

Slight headache. Stomach feels crappy. You are definitely not productive.
Anytime a girl walks by you gag because her perfume reminds you of the
random gin shots you did with your alcoholic friends after the bouncer 86'd
your ass at 1:45 a.m. Life would be better right now if you were in your
bed
with a dozen donuts and a meatball sub You've had 4 cups of coffee, a
gallon
of water, 3 Snapples and a liter of diet coke yet you haven't peed once.



4 star hangover (****)

Life sucks. Your head is throbbing and you can't speak too quickly or else
you might puke. Your boss has already lambasted you for being late and
given
you a lecture for reeking of booze. You wore nice clothes,but that can't
hide the fact that you missed an oh-so crucial spot shaving, (girls,it
looks
like you put your make-up on while riding the bumper cars). Your eyes look
like one big vein and your hair style makes you look like a reject from the
class picture of Revere High, '76.



5 star hangover(*****)

a.k.a. "Dante's 4th Circle of Hell." You have a second heartbeat inyour
head
which is actually annoying the employee who sits in the nextcube.  Vodka
vapor is seeping out of every pore and making you dizzy. You still have
toothpaste crust in the corners of your mouth from brushing your teeth.
Your
body has lost the ability to generate saliva, so your tongue is suffocating
you. Death seems pretty good right now. You definitely don't remember who
you were with, where you were, what you drank, and why there is a stranger
still sleeping in your bed at your house.



6 star hangover (******)

Otherwise known as the "Infinite Nutsmacker"You wake up on your bathroom
floor. For about 2 seconds you look at the ceiling, wondering if the cool
refreshing feeling on your cheek is the bathroom tile or your vomit from 5
hours ago. It is amazing how your roommate who was as drunk as you, but
somehow manages to get up before you the next morning...You try to lift
your
head. Not an option. It is when you turn your head too quickly only to
smell
the funk of 13 packs of cigarettes in your hair, and suddenly you realize
you were smoking, but not ultra lights... some jackass handed you Marlboro
reds, and you smoked them like it was your second full time job. You look
in
the mirror only to see remnants of the stamp "Ready to Rock" faintly atop
your forehead... that explains the stamp on the back of your hand that has
magically appeared on your forehead by alcoholic osmosis. You have to be to
work in t-minus 14 minutes and 32 seconds and the only thing you can think
of wearing is your "hello kitty" pajamas.....
