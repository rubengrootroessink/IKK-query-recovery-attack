Joe,
 
It was nice talking with you today.  I will be more than happy to keep you up to date on anything I come across.  Please let me know if something changes in your situation.  I have attached a presentation that will show the different types of positions we recruit for.  If you know someone else that may like assistance as well, feel free to pass my contact information along.
 
Thanks for your time and I look forward to talking to you again in the future!
