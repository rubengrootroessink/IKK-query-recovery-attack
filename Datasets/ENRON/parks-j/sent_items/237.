Kay,
	ENA has received a letter from Pace Global Energy Services, who is agent for Reynolds metals Company, detailing what actions it has taken to settle damages it incurred for the month of December. Would you please give a call when you have a moment to discuss what action we need to take at this point.  

Thanks, 
Joe
