Had fun. Glad to see everyone at the Hybrid man night. Reported to Zander, 
who was glad to hear we enjoyed the food. Joe that was not a TV dinner.
We still need to take care of the deer lease food/beer issues. ....whenever.
FYI John (Wollam) is fine. Has a pulled muscle in his neck.
Enjoyed eating eyes, eye socket fatty tissue, head meat, talking about how 
much I care for my dog, eating heart meat, men playing with their meat, 
bowel distress and "grapes" and seeing how it played out for the one MAN 
audience.
I doubt Dave Wieland will join us again and Ted will likely be asked to turn

down the next invitation to join us by his friend.
I give the food an A+, service was also excellent. Chad gets the award for 
being most "in" to the effort.
I will mark my calendar for 60 days to rip a thread for the next effort. e.
