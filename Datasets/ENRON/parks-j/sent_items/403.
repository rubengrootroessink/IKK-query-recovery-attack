Paul
	Paul, thanks for forwarding my resume to Tom.  I met with him and several other nice people over there this afternoon. They seem like a great group to work with. The position sounds very interesting and like it would be a good opportunity.  Hopefully, something will work out. Again, I really appreciate your efforts.


Thanks
Joe
