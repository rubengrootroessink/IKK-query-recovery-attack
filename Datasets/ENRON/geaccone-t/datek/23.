News & Views
No speech or joke can be great unless it finds a receptive audience. 
The same, of course, is true for the products or services that a 
company bets the store on. Check out Datek's perspective on this 
phenomenon -- and on a once-mighty "household name" whose time has 
apparently come and gone.

Stock Screen of the Month
Next time someone tells you "it's all relative," be sure to mention 
that's especially true of stock valuations. Learn how a function

Technical Tools of the Trade
Have you ever watched a stock that seems to bounce around a lot, but 
never really gets anywhere? You've probably found a stock that is 
locked in a so-called trading range. Understanding the relationship 
between support, resistance and trading ranges can help you spot when 
a stock breaks out of the range and starts a new trend.
