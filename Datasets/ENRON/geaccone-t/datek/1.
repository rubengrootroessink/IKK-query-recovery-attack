Please respond to announcementsDear Tracy Geaccone:
Many investors are now taking a more active role in their strategies 
by directing trades to market makers or ECNs (Electronic 
Communications Networks). If you are ready to take your trading to a 
higher level, use Datek's new direct access trading product, Datek
Direct1 to route your orders:
  ?  Exclusively to The Island ECN
; 
  ?  To your choice of any other ECN or market maker; 
  ?  To SOES (Small Order Execution Systems); or 
  ?  Through the proprietary Auto Routing technology that ordinarily 
     handles your Datek Online orders.2
Designed for demanding hands-on investors, Datek Direct lets you 
trade for an introductory commission of $9.99 per online equity trade 
up to 5,000 shares. As an additional level of service, all orders 
routed through Datek Direct will first travel to The Island ECN
 for 
an immediate "price check" that determines whether your desired price 
can be matched or improved upon. The average time it takes to 
complete this "price check" is 0.2 seconds or less.
SPECIAL LIMITED-TIME OFFER: Enabling Datek Direct in your account 
will also give you access to the new Level II quotes on the Streamer

real-time quote system. Sign up now for Datek Direct and we'll waive 
the $9.99 monthly fee3 for Level II quotes through February 28, 2001.
Datek Direct further strengthens our reputation as the online 
brokerage that is "Built To Trade." Get additional information and activate your account for Datek Direct today .
Your feedback is very important to us. Please send comments with the 
subject "Datek Direct" to support@datek.com . You may also contact 
Customer Support at 1-800-U2-DATEK.

1 Datek Direct is a tool, as the name implies, that allows customers 
to direct their Nasdaq orders to a specific execution venue. The 
name should not be deemed to imply that a customer is dealing 
directly with the marketplace. All orders are processed through 
Datek Online Brokerage Services LLC, a registered broker/dealer. 
Please note that, once you have activated Datek Direct, all of the 
other features in your Datek Online account will continue to operate 
without change. 
2 Datek's 60-second commitment does not apply for orders placed 
through Datek Direct unless Auto Routing is selected. This is because 
trading rules allow market participants up to three minutes to 
respond and execute or return your order. 
3 After February 28, 2001, Level II quotes on the Streamer system are 
available FREE of exchange fees for non-professional users if you 
trade with Datek more than 20 times a month. Trade less and you still 
can access Streamer Level II quotes for the modest exchange fee of 
$9.99 per month for non-professional users. Prices and availability 
are subject to change. 
High volumes of trading and volatility may result in executions at 
prices significantly away from the price quoted or displayed at the 
time of order entry. 
System response and access times may vary due to market conditions, 
system performance, and other factors. 
This e-mail is just one of the ways that we keep you and other Datek 
Online account holders up-to-date about product and service 
innovations and beta testing at Datek Online. These communications 
may also spotlight special incentives that we hope will motivate you 
to consider trying something new at Datek. Please let us know  if 
you'd prefer that these e-mails not continue. http://datek1.m0.net/m/u/dtk/d.asp?e=tgeacco%40enron.com
