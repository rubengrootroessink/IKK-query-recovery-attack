Dear Customer, 
Datek Online is restructuring its online business in order to maximize 
the efficiencies of our operations and leading-edge technology for 
various brokerage functions. Simply, this restructuring allows us to 
position our resources for growth well into the future. 
This restructuring will result in no change as to how your account is 
being handled. You have no paperwork to complete or new numbers to 
remember. You will still receive the same quality executions and 
services you have come to expect from Datek. 
What exactly is happening to your account?
As of the close of business on June 29, 2001, Datek Online Brokerage 
Services LLC will transfer your account to an affiliate, Datek Online 
Financial Services LLC. iClearing LLC, our clearing company, will 
continue in its role as clearing agent and will carry your account as 
clearing broker pursuant to a Clearing Agreement with Datek Online 
Financial Services LLC. 
Per the Customer Agreement, the Terms and Conditions to which you have 
previously agreed will inure to Datek Online Financial Services LLC. 
What does it mean to you?
Your brokerage account is still at Datek and all functions remain the 
same. It does not change your account number, password, or username. 
Again, your account and the services we provide are the same. The only 
difference is that your account will be a Datek Online Financial 
Services LLC account rather than a Datek Online Brokerage Services 
LLC account. 
How are your account statements affected?
Future trade confirmations and account statements will be sent by 
Datek Online Financial Services LLC. 
If you receive electronic monthly statements, you will only receive 
one June monthly statement in that iClearing is remaining as the 
clearing agent. 
How is your end of year 1099 statement affected?
You will receive one end of year 1099 account statement sent by Datek 
Online Financial Services in that iClearing is remaining as the 
clearing agent. 
Who do you make checks payable to?
All check deposits should continue to be made out to Datek Online and 
should include your UserName and Account Number on the check. 
What happens to open orders in your account. Will those carry over to 
Datek Online Financial Services LLC?
Yes. All open orders, balances, positions, and documents will carry 
over with your account. 
We look forward to a smooth transition and completion of our 
restructuring. Once again, no further action by you is necessary. 
Thank you and welcome to Datek Online Financial Services LLC. 
High volumes of trading and volatility may result in executions at 
prices significantly away from the price quoted or displayed at the 
time of order entry. 
System response and access times may vary due to market conditions, 
system performance, and other factors.
