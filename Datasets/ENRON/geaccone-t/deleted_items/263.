I have Steve's slides.  Eric do you have your slides revised including Transpecos?  I do not have that yet.

Thanks

Tracy and Dan,

Steve and I revised the business development slides for Stan's presentation.  I'm waiting for Kim Watson to update the TransPecos slide and will forward when complete.  Will forward final rendition when completed, probably on Monday.
