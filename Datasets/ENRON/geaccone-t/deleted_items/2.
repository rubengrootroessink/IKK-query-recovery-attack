HELLO!  THIS  IS  AMERICA!

>
>
>
>Broken Arrow, Oklahoma School officials
>remove "God Bless America" signs from schools
>in fear that someone might be offended.
>
>Channel 12 News in Long Island, New York,
>orders flags removed from the newsroom
>and red, white, and blue ribbons removed
>from the lapels of reporters.
>
>Why?
>
>Management did not want to appear biased
>and felt that our nations flag might
>give the appearance that "they lean
>one way or another".
>
>Berkeley, California bans U.S. Flags
>from being displayed on city fire
>trucks because they didn't want
>to offend anyone in the community.
>
>In an "act of tolerance" the head of
>the public library at Florida Gulf
>Coast University ordered all
>"Proud to be an American" signs
>  removed so as to not offend
>international students.
>
>I, for one, am quite disturbed by
>these actions of so-called American
>citizens; and I am tired of this nation
>worrying about whether or not we are
>offending some individual or their culture.
>
>Since the terrorist attacks on
>September 11, we have experienced
>a surge in patriotism by the majority
>of Americans. However, the dust
>from the attacks had barely settled
>in New York and Washington D.C.
>when the "politically correct" crowd
>began complaining about the possibility
>that our patriotism was offending others.
>
>I am not against immigration,
>nor do I hold a grudge against
>anyone who is seeking a better
>life by coming to America.
>
>In fact, our country's population
>is almost entirely comprised of
>descendants of immigrants;
>
>however,
>there are a few things that those
>who have recently come to our
>country, and apparently some native
>Americans, need to understand.
>
>First of all,
>it is not our responsibility
>to continually try not to offend you
>in any way. This idea of America being
>a multi-cultural community has served
>only to dilute our sovereignty and
>our national identity.
>
>As Americans,
>  we have our own culture,
>our own society, our own language,
>and our own lifestyle.
>
>This culture, called
>the "American Way"
>has been developed over centuries
>of struggles, trials, and victories
>by millions of men and women
>who have sought freedom.
>
>Our forefathers fought, bled,
>and died at places such as Bunker Hill,
>Antietam, San Juan, Iwo Jima,
>Normandy, Korea, Vietnam,
>
>We speak English, not Spanish,
>Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Russian,
>or any other language. Therefore, if
>you wish to become part of our
>society - learn our language!
>
>"In God We Trust"
>is our national motto.
>
>This is not some off-the-wall,
>Christian, Right Wing, political slogan;
>it is our national motto.
>
>  It is engraved in stone in the House
>of Representatives in our Capitol
>and it is printed on our currency.
>
>We adopted this motto because
>Christian men and women, on
>Christian principles, founded this
>nation; and this is clearly documented
>throughout our history.
>
>If it is appropriate for our motto
>to be inscribed in the halls of our
>highest level of Government,
>then it is certainly appropriate
>to display it on the walls of our schools.
>
>God is in our pledge,
>our National Anthem, nearly every
>patriotic song, and in our founding
>documents.  We honor His birth, death,
>and resurrection as holidays, and we
>turn to Him in prayer in times of crisis.
>
>If God offends you, then I suggest
>you consider another part of the world
>as your new home, because God is part
>of our culture and we are proud
>to have Him.
>
>We are proud of our heritage and those
>who have so honorably defended
>our freedoms. We celebrate
>Independence Day, Memorial Day,
>Veterans Day, and Flag Day.
>
>We have parades, picnics, and barbecues
>where we proudly wave our flag.
>
>As an American, I have the right
>to wave my flag, sing my national
>anthem, quote my national motto,
>and cite my pledge whenever and
>wherever I choose.
>
>If the Stars and Stripes offend you,
>or you don't like Uncle Sam,
>then you should seriously consider
>a move to another part of this planet.
>
>The American culture is our way of life,
>our heritage, and we are proud of it.
>We are happy with our culture and
>have no desire to change, and we
>really don't care how you did
>things where you came from,
>if it was so superior, go home.
>
>We are Americans, like it or not,
>this is our country, our land,
>and our lifestyle.
>
>Our First Amendment gives every
>citizen the right to express his
>opinion about our government, culture,
>or society, and we will allow you
>every opportunity to do so.
>
>But once you are done complaining,
>whining, and griping about our flag,
>our pledge, our national motto,
>or our way of life,
>I highly encourage you take advantage
>of one other great American freedom,
>the right to leave.
>
>
>If you agree,
>pass this onto other Americans!!
>It is time to take a stand!!
>
>MAY GOD BLESS AMERICA
>LAND THAT WE LOVE!!!
