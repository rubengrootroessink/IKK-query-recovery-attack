Tracy and Michael,

Here's the revised budget.  Michael, please assess the timing of capital draw downs (eg, quarterly spends) against the IBIT target to make sure we have synchronized estimates.  I assume that capital drawn down during Q1 would require 4/4ths of IBIT requirement, Q2 would require 3/4ths of IBIT requirement, etc.  The current numbers indicate all capital would be drawn down in Q1, which is not the case.
