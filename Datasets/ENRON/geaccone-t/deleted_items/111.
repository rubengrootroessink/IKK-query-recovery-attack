Danny is requesting a summary of the Weekly Executive Summary (current month forecasted results compared to Plan or CE) for all three pipes.  He would like one starting this Friday.  I am getting copies of everyone's from last week and look for some common data that makes sense to put on one page.  

But in order to get it ready in time, I am asking you to have your own weekly summary (in the exact same format you always do it in)  ready by noon this Thursday, September 27th.  

The Danny Summary would not replace but be in addition to the one you already publish.
