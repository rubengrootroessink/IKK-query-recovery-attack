Do we really have a choice on EOL.  What is the total cost for ETS compared to what we orginally had in 2002?  I need to discuss with Danny.

Thanks

We have this line on the functional income statement and are handling it.  Please note that the costs have more than doubled and Steve Hotte is preparing to discuss with ENW as to why?  TW EOL charge is $113291 for 2002.  Will Steve Harris want to continue using EOL for that amount??  Since you should have put $35,000 in commercial for EOL, I am reflecting the difference in the ENW line.  cvb

Attached is the updated version of the 2002 plan assessments from ENW for your business unit.  This intercompany billing invoice now includes pass throughs.  Consistent with 2001, pass through billings (long distance, market data, WAN, etc.) will not be included in the standard assessments ("8xxxxxxx" accounts).  They will be posted directly to direct expenses ("5xxxxxxx" accounts) at the cost center level.  This pass through number is only a high level place holder and is not intended to replace the dollars already being budgeted for by each cost center owner.

If you have any questions, you can contact Kevin May at x52508 and he will answer any questions or direct you to the correct person.

If you are not the correct person to receive these assessments or if there is someone else that you would like to include in this process, please reply back to me with this information and I will add them to the contact list for future correspondence.

Thanks,

Jay
