Tracy, Caroline said she owes you lunch for being late.  Actually, we were on time;  we just had alot of late changes, and the NBPL numbers from Omaha came in yesterday late.  Enough excuses;  let Caroline take you to lunch, and make her take you somewhere nicer than the TacoBell drive through.
Thanks,

Nancy
