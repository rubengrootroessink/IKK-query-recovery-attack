Tracy, per your note to me - I have scheduled your conference call w/Victor
Ward for Tuesday, 11:00 to 11:30 AM Central.
Victor also wants Nancy Bradford to be included in the meeting.  Nancy
Bradford of IBM will be meeting with you at Enron and Victor will be
calling into your office at 1-713-853-6833.

Could you please provide me with the information as to where Nancy should
meet you?

Thank you
