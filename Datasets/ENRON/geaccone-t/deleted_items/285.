Southwest Airlines' Click 'n Save E-mail Update

A message to our Customers: 

Because your toes miss the ocean.
Because only a few towns really know how to polka.
Because your hometown still feels like home.
Because the sunset needs someone to show off for.
Because babies are only babies for so long.

Let's Fly.

Luv,
