"When the crypt doors creak and the tombstones quake, spooks come out for a swinging wake. Happy haunts materialize and begin to vocalize. Grim Grinning Ghosts come out to socialize."  Welcome, foolish mortals, to our Halloween jamboree.

The spirits will materialize only if you fill your ghostly retreat with "wall-to-wall creeps and hot and cold running chills." We have everything you need to create a frightfully fun Disney Halloween this holiday.
