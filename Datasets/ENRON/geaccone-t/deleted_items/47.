Due to Rick's leadership offsite, the Sunrise Steering Committee meeting this Wednesday morning has been rescheduled for October 2, 10am.  Because of that postponement, the October 17 meeting will be cancelled.  

You may have heard that Mark Frank has moved to EES, where he will Controller for EnronDirect.  We will miss his day to day involvement, but he has expressed an interest in staying involved as a commercial user of the Sunrise data warehouse.  

Here's where we are on the project.  

We are on track for our September 30 data warehouse rollouts of earnings, AP and AR.  Testing is going well, and we appreciate each BU sending users to work with us to test the functionality.  There will be standard reports for each of those new content areas.  Be sure your BU is well represented in the training scheduled for the last 2 weeks of October!

Following the September 30 rollouts, we will have all of our originally planned content in the data warehouse, so we will be concentrating on increasing usage.  We have been presenting roadshows (demos that come to you), which we plan to expand.  In addition, we will be identifying power users in your group who will be experts at both SAP reporting and Business Objects reporting from the data warehouse, so they can advise others as to the best option for a specific reporting need.  Let me know who you'd like us to work with in your group.

The Adaytum planning model is nearly completed.  We are working with Steve Schwarzbach and Greg Adams to ensure that any changes to their excel templates will be incorporated into the model.  We will be running parallel for the 2002 Plan process that is due October 4 - excel templates will be turned in at that time, and the Adaytum model will be completed and reconciled back to the excel results shortly after that.  If your group would prefer to start with Adaytum, we have prepared excel output files and we will come and work with your planners at their desk to get them up and running.  Let us know when you want us to work with you.
