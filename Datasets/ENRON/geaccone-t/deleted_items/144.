Tracy:

I'm back!  I enjoyed my long weekend.

My 20th anniversary with Enron is today. (I started at a very young age!)   I have already selected my gift and you should be receiving it soon.  It will probably come in a box because I ordered a matching necklace and bracelet.


There are not many days remaining in 2001 and I need to take some vacation days because I have quite a few days left to take.  I have looked at the calendar and hopefully chosen days that will have the least amount of impact on everyone.

Anyway, this is what I came up with:

November 1
November 9
November 19-21 (Thanksgiving week)  I had already made plans to visit my family in Kansas for Thanksgiving
				       before Palu left.  I spoke with Jeanette and she has agreed to do the 
				       weekly on that Tuesday before Thanksgiving, if we do a weekly that week.
				       I don't think we did a weekly last year due to the 3 day work week.
December 7
December 17
December 21
December 31 

I also plan on carrying over 1 week.

Let me know if you have a problem with any of these dates.

Jan
