Actually we are not going to wear any of these in FA&A.     They will be carried at the legal entity level, even though we may put them in the model as FA&A.   There are just some issues that won't go away.    I will still need the calculations of the depreciation and such so that we can determine who is responsible, when we do the legal entity stuff, so we may as well add everything the way we were planning to do it and we will format it to where we want to show it in the final.

The latest from a discussion with Rod, Mary Kay and Dave N. this morning:


FA&A will carry the depreciation - targets may be adjusted for yr to yr increase

IMP and FAS 106 will  be carried at FA&A ,Potential offsets to yr to yr increases are yet to be  determined.


Thus, the above items will not be put into the NNG Commercial Adaytum model.
