Why do I need to do this?  Should you discuss with Mary Kay?

Tracy,  could you please send me the info for TW Commercial for the 3rd CE and also the TW 2002 plan detail.  Please send me any updates as they occur also.  I'm receiving the detailed info from Steve Gilbert, but he doesn't always have the TW info, so it would be easier if you just sent it directly to me.   Please call if any questions.   thanks   Mary Kay
