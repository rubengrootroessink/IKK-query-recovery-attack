Tracy,

Over the past few weeks I have received a great deal of financial information.  Would you have time today to sit down for a few minutes with me and walk through what I have so I make sure that I don't miss anything when I sent the financial section to the data room?  Please call me when you have a moment and let me know if this would be possible.

Thank you for all of your help!
Sarah
