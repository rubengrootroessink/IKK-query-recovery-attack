Dear Tracy Geaccone, 

Home for the Holidays takes on special meaning this year. Transform your home into a holiday winter wonderland with our Fresh Evergreen Wreath & Garland <http://www.calyxandcorolla.com/pages/product.cfm?Group=BU000653&TID=11 2701Hol_01>, a perfect complement to any d?cor. Imagine how beautiful our fresh-cut garland and wreath combination will look on display. It also makes a lavish decorating gift sure to be remembered and appreciated. To complete the holiday look, add our Fresh Evergreen Centerpiece <http://www.calyxandcorolla.com/pages/product.cfm?Group=BU000611&TID=11 2701Hol_05> with its bow of gold-dotted red ribbon and lovely fragrance and greenery.

Our Noel Wreath Trio <http://www.calyxandcorolla.com/pages/product.cfm?Group=BU000663&TID=11 2701Hol_02> adds merriment to the holiday home and makes a lovely hostess gift or party favor. It's comprised of three 6" cedar wreaths with pine cones, juniper berries, canella berries and sprays of white rice flowers suspended by luscious red satin ribbons connected to a stylish 30" wide bundle of twigs.

The Christmas Garden <http://www.calyxandcorolla.com/pages/product.cfm?Group=BU000265&TID=11 2701Hol_03> is our most festive holiday basket. The decorative 10" round basket houses a cyclamen plant with bright red flowers and variegated leaves, a miniature red rose bush covered with buds and blooms and a blue pine tree. Long-lasting, it makes an ideal gift for a business associate or a superb decorating addition to your home. 

Our first-ever offering of exquisite handcrafted decorative floral ornaments must be seen. The Ornament Trio <http://www.calyxandcorolla.com/pages/accessories_product.cfm?sku=AC92& TID=112701Hol_04> is crafted in Europe, mouth-blown, and painstakingly detailed by hand. These make an unparalleled gift for any flower lover.
