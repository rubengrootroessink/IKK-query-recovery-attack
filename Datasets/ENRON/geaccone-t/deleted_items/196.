I will be out of the office the afternoon of 10/25 and all day on 10/26.  Please direct and/or copy Nancy Carpenter on your email so that it will receive the required attention.  Nancy will handle all financial related questions and can be reached at x36311.  For any GMS/PGAS related questions please contact Ellis Stern x67896.
Thank you...cvb
