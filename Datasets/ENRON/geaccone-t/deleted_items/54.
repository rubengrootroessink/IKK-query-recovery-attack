We will not be discussing TW as we have already met with Danny on our numbers.

Thanks

Bring your schedules and enough copies to the meeting (and fax a set to Steve Gilbert in Omaha) on Wednesday, September 19th, 49C2, 10:30 - 12:00.  No Lunch.

Since we don't have much time.  Bring whatever schedules you want to help tell your story.  I am going to update my Net Commercial Contribution page to show our Stretch and my Capital Budget has changed significantly.  If any of the pages that were presented to Danny on August 16th changed significantly, I suggest you update them.
