Greg/Stephen,
Our Europe and Middle East projects has also changed significantly following Jim Hughes trip to Europe.  We'll rework the numbers (with Cuiaba also) and forward that to Tracy tomorrow.  Thanks.

Greg,
It does reflect the consolidation of Cuiaba except that Cuiaba number is changing significantly.  We hope to update for that by tomorrow.

Agatha & Mei-Ling,

Does the current version of the plan you submitted reflect the consolidation of Cuiaba?
In particular, the impact on Interest Expense & Capital Expenditures for 2002.

If you need to make changes please get them to us ASAP.

Thanks ........
