I have attached the minutes from our last User Group Meeting along with the revised training schedule.  Please note that we will NOT be meeting next week, October 24, 2001.  We will resume our meetings beginning October 31, 2001.  Also, I will be out of the office until Thursday October 25th, so if you have any questions please contact the ISC Help Desk at 5-4SAP or leave me a message and I will get back with you when I return.
 
Thank you,
Brad Stewart
