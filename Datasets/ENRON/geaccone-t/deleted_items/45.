Please note that Steve Hotte's organization is verifying that these charges are valid for all companies and that they have not been agreed upon.  I will keep you posted as to the final agreed upon numbers.  This line item will be entered into Adaytum under Information Technology by Nancy Carpenter.  Please call if you have any questions  x36375.  Thanks?cvb

Attached is the updated version of the 2002 plan assessments from ENW for your business unit.  This intercompany billing invoice now includes pass throughs.  Consistent with 2001, pass through billings (long distance, market data, WAN, etc.) will not be included in the standard assessments ("8xxxxxxx" accounts).  They will be posted directly to direct expenses ("5xxxxxxx" accounts) at the cost center level.  This pass through number is only a high level place holder and is not intended to replace the dollars already being budgeted for by each cost center owner.

If you have any questions, you can contact Kevin May at x52508 and he will answer any questions or direct you to the correct person.

If you are not the correct person to receive these assessments or if there is someone else that you would like to include in this process, please reply back to me with this information and I will add them to the contact list for future correspondence.

Thanks,

Jay
