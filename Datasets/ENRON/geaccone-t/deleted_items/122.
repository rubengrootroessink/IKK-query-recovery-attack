Subject:	2002 Plan Template - Revsion #4

Again, I do apologize for all of the revisions.  The only change in this revision is the deletion of line 20, "Taxes Other Than Income", in the 3rd sheet, "O&M by Department".  It was included erroneously.  Thanks to Mei-Ling Kaster for discovering this.  TOTI has a section of its own beginning on line 49.  Please use this template to submit your Plans.
Thanks,
Steve
