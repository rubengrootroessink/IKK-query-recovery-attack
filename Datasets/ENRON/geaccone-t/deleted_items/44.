EOTT the MLP should not receive charges.  Co 1195 which represents Enron Pipeline Services, the support for EOTT, MLP operations should not have any as well.  These ususally go to very upper level management only. 

Lori, do you know if Dana participates in this?

EOTT should not be allocated any of the charges detailed below but since I do not know what any of the company numbers are can you please confirm to me that EOTT is not receiving an allocation.  Thanks.
