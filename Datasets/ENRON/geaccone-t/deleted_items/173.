	Karl,
	Sorry for the delay in responding.  I have spoken to Jim Saunders on the Accounting allocation.  He is sending 3% of his time for the accounting information flow to and from Co. 1195 as well as the investment accounting, and time spent on the reorganization accounting matters.  The remaining dollars of the accounting allocation are from Rod Hayslett for the time he is spending on Co. 1195 issues.  I hope this gives you the information you need.
	Mary

I'm getting back to something, I left  you a message last week.  When Barney presented the ETS budget for the pipeline operations, he included amounts allocated from ETS for IT ($170k) and Accounting ($59k).  You left me a phone mail  message regarding the IT charge and suggested that I contact Caroline Barnes (which I did today).  Both of these appear to be new charges for 2002 and we'd like to get information on what they relate to.  Can you shed some light on the Accounting charge?

Thanks
Karl
