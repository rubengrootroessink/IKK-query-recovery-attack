Take all American women who are within five years of Menopause - train us
for a few weeks, outfit us with automatic weapons, hand grenades, gas masks=
,
moisturizer with SPF15, Prozac, hormones, chocolate, and canned tuna - drop
us (parachuted, preferably) across the landscape of Afghanistan, and let us
do what comes naturally. Think about it. Our anger quotient alone, even whe=
n
doing standard stuff like grocery shopping and paying bills, is formidable
enough to make even armed men in turbans tremble.
We've had our children, we would gladly suffer or die to protect them and
their future
We'd like to get away from our husbands, if they haven't left already. And
for those of us who are single, the prospect of finding a good man with who=
m
to share life is about as likely as being struck by lightning.
We have nothing to lose. We've survived the water diet, the protein diet,
the carbohydrate diet, and the grapefruit diet in gyms and saunas across
America and never lost a pound. We can easily survive months in the hostile
terrain of Afghanistan with no food at all!
We've spent years tracking down our husbands or lovers in bars, hardware
stores, or sporting events...finding Bin Laden in some cave will be no
problem. Uniting all the warring tribes of Afghanistan in a new government?
Oh, please ... we've planned the seating arrangements for in-laws and
extended families at Thanksgiving Dinners for years ... we understand triba=
l
warfare. Between us, we've divorced enough husbands to know every trick
there is for how they hide, launder, or cover up bank accounts and money
sources.
We know how to find that money and we know how to seize it... with or
without, the government's help!
Let us go and fight. The Taliban hates women. Imagine their terror as we
crawl like ants with hot-flashes over their godforsaken terrain.
I'm going to write my Congresswoman. You should, too!
