There are files that back up the revenue projections that Steve Kleb gave me hard copies of for 2001 and 2002.  Can I get electronic copies of these, they have volumes and margins and appear to back up the revenue projections.   File looks like s/marketing/twfinmkt-anly/
Tw/twfin/2001/misc/plan-forecast-design.xls/summary.  If the same exists for 2000 can we get it as well.  I would like as soon as possible and you can email to the cc addresses as well.
