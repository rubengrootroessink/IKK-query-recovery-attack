It's a report of actuals, most of the data comes off the templates the overseas offices send in.  It compares back to plan and current estimate and is still reporting the 2nd CE numbers.  What is reported is Revenue, EBITDA and EBIT by project.

Michael works for John and we have reviewed the 3rd CE with both.  I can forward to you, I am curious as to what the report is that you are preparing?

Thanks

Tracy

Tracy,
Can you send me whatever you got from Kenny/Michael for Azurix 3rd Current Estimate?  I have a report due to John Garrison that asks for that information.

Thanks,

Paula
