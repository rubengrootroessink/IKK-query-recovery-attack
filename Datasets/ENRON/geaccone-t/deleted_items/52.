I am not sure what you mean by GPG, really ETS, corporate groups?  Maybe you can give me a call and we can discuss.

Thanks

Gina and Jo- I'm pulling together some information regarding the company's total spend on PR and Gov't Affairs.  I'm in contact with the individual pipeline groups regarding their state level GA spend.  Can you provide me any 2002 budget and headcount estimates for the GPG corporate groups?  I understand that the business units prepare their budgets later than Corp., but even rough numbers would be helpful.

Thanks for your help!
