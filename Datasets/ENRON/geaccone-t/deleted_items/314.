An elderly couple was driving cross-country from Florida to attend their
granddaughter's wedding. Both were hard of hearing, but she was growing
deaf as a post. They pulled into a service station, and the attendant asked
the man if he could help them.

The old man replied, "Fill her up!".

His wife said, "WHAT'D HE SAY?"

The old man said, "HE WANTED TO KNOW IF HE COULD HELP US. I TOLD HIM TO FILL
IT UP!"

"Oooh...", she replied.

When the attendant had filled up the tank, he returned to the driver's side
and said, "Will that be cash or charge?" The old man passed him his charge
card, and the old lady said, "WHAT'D HE SAY?"

The old man replied, "HE WANTED TO KNOW IF IT WAS
CASH OR CHARGE, AND I TOLD HIM TO CHARGE IT!"

"Ohhh..", she said.

The attendant returned with the card, and while the man was signing, he
said,

"I noticed from your license plates and your charge card that y'all are from

Florida. I was in Florida once, and I can tell you that all I can remember
about that trip was that I got the worse piece of ass down there that I've
ever had."

The old man nodded, and took his card back. The old woman said, "WHAT'D HE
SAY?"

The old man said, "SAYS HE THINKS HE KNOWS YOU!"
