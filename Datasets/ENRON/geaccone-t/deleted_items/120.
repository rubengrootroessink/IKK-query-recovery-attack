The charge needs to be sent to Co 1202.  Tell Vera to make sure she picks up in 2002 Plan and tell the Corp group to send to Co 1202.

Thanks

      Mary,

      I personally do not know this individual but I am sure Vera can confirm it with Don Hawkins.

      Vera,
CLick on the file that Mary sent. The name of the employee is Patricio Puente, Quality Management, and he appears to be an expat. in Bolivia.

Thanks,
Rositza

	Rositza,
	Do you know if this individual is in ETS EAMR?  This group works with Expat employees and they are wanting to send us costs for 2002.  Thank you.

Mary,

I don't work for the Global Employee Services Group (GES).  It was my responsibility to forward to all BU's the plan numbers that were forwarded from Tim Callahan to Agatha Tran.  The GES Group deals 100% with all Expats through out Enron.  If you onto the Internet and get into Planet.enron.com this should provide you with a better idea of what this group provides through out Enron.  According to the employee listing that Tim Callahan provided to backup plan assumptions, ETS has only one employee.  I've attached that information.

Hope this helps.

Thanks,

Patti

	Patti,
	I have not received a response.  We need additional information regarding these expenses for 2002.  We will be finalizing our plan next week (Wednesday) for presentation to Management.  If we are not comfortable that these are valid expenses we will not be able to include them or accept them in next year's budget.  Thank you.
	Mary

	Patti,
	I work with Tracy Geaccone in ETS.  Can you provide us some detail about the services provided to ETS by your group?  Also, which cost center will you use to send us these charges?  Thank you.

Attached is the 2002 Plan Allocation Assumption by BU regarding the Global Employee Services Group.  I've also attached the employee listing in case you have any questions as to who makes up your numbers.  The information was provided by Tim Callahan.

Thanks,

Patti
