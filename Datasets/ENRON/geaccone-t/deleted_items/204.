Hi James - know Michele has come to you with financial # crunching requests & she would have this time as well, but she's stuck in Duluth (airplane problems).

Anyway, we're putting together/coordinating preliminary bonus recommendations for EGS.  Do you have Q3 IBIT numbers for the various EGS Business Units such as EGS International/NEPCO, Azurix, etc. or is this information that I need to get from each group?

Thanks much./Jana
