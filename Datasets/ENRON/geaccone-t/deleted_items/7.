I know I have been absent from the 2 regularly scheduled meetings on Friday am for the last 2 weeks and it is not going to get a lot better for the next 2 weeks either.   For this I apologize, but I am trying to understand the new expanded world to determine any potential points of integration, if any.    I am going to have Kathy see if there is a time earlier in the week that we might be able to use for direct reports and administrative matters and a separate time for Commercial support reviews.  Please keep the reports flowing  as this is currently my means of keeping up.     I would like for staff meetings to continue, even in my absence for the next 2 weeks.

I am working on some organizational changes, which I am not quite ready to discuss, but they should not impact the majority of you at all.     I will not be replacing me in my old position in ETS, but will be expanding the crew to include the worlds of EGAS, Wind, Azurix, EEOS, Portland (they will be here for most of the next year) etc.     In the meantime if you need to talk to me please have Kathy get you in to my schedule in person or via phone.    I am also in the office nearly everyday, other than tuesday (EOTT staff meetings), by 6:30 am.
