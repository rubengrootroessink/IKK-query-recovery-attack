Any costs related to looking at buying an asset must be expensed if we don't buy anything.  Thus, these costs need to be expensed on 1755.  We will need to write off the costs in Eric's cost center in December if we don't buy anything to write them off against.

Thanks

Tracy,

What exactly do you want moved over to the new company (1755)?  The only thing we have moved so far is the 1N9 revenues (and related costs). Do you want all of Eric Gadd's costs moved?

Whatever the new company is that we set to record profit and losses on.

	Tracy,
	Did you want to expense these costs in Eric Gadd's cc?
