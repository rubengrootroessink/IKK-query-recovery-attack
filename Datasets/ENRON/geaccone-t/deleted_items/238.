See Julie's note below.   We'll want to go ahead and proceed with the Quarter Forecast Meeting even if Danny's not available, right?

Cindy:
Please note that Danny will returning on November 13th from a business trip (out 11th-13th) and not able to make the 1:30 Quarter Forecast Meeting with Stan.  Note the Management Conference is November 14-16 and the following week is Thanksgiving.  

Please advise if you want to reset the meeting. Thanks.
