For you, it is not really due today.  We just sent you the e-mail that we sent to our other companies.  As soon as you can get the data is ok.  Corp is looking for a 4th Q estimate pretty soon , though.  We also need to get this through Stan.  Lets discuss this afternoon.  Sorry for the scare.

Tracy

James and Tracy

I was under a completely different timetable with regard to the 3rd CE.  Was it really due today?  I still need a day or two to clean up?  Can you provide some guidance on timing?  Thanks.
