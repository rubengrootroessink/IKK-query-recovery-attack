Tracy,
As Michael already told you, I am working on a valutation project for Rod, and was hoping to get cash flow (projections) for Northern Nautral and Transwestern. If you have info for EOTT also, that would be great. Otherwise, can you direct me where to get the info?
Please feel free to ask me any questions you might have.

Thanks,

JB
