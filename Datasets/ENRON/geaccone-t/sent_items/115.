Rod and Tracy,

I'm confirming who's planning to attend the Nutcracker Market Brunch on Friday, Nov. 9.  

Confirmed to date include:

Gina Taylor
Cindy Stark
Debbie Horton
Lynn Blair
Socal Customer

Roc, is Kathy still planning to attend?  Tracy, can you come?

Please let me know by the end of this week.

Thanks!

Gina
