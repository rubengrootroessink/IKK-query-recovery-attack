Well, the stock price is down $1 and some change because of the 3Q 10Q.  I went over the 4Q numbers with Stan.  He was ok with them.  I am either sitting in for him or accompanying him to the Whalley meeting today.  Enron announced they are going to have layoffs next week.  I am sure you have seen the e-mail.  The office is quiet.  How are things going up there?  Are you leaving this afternoon?
