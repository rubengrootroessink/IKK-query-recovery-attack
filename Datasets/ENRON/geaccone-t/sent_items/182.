Oh?next Monday is bad because I have a Halloween party for MC at Cr?me de la Cr?me?so I'm taking off early that day. The 31st is bad, too.  How about Tuesday, Thursday or Friday next week?

I like the dinner group idea.  What about lunch on Monday, Oct 29?

Hey Tracy,
 
How are you?  It seems like ages since we've seen each other. 
 
Bunco?well, I know Pam Guidry was the October person, but we figured it wouldn't happen because she hasn't been to the last couple of Buncos.  Then the list ended and I haven't heard from anyone complaining.  I'm not sure if Christi Chickering is still having a Holiday Bunco or not. I'm surprised we haven't heard from Sandra or Debbie via e-mail. Mary Lynn probably won't join again, she wants to do a small dinner group with just you, me, Lisa, Stephanie?the five of us?unless I'm missing someone.
 
Let me know when you're free for lunch, I'm pretty flexible these days.
