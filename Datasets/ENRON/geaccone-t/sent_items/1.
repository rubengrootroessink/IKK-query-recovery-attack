No problem. I have a meeting that should be over around 6 and can be home around 6:30. If you need to drop them off earlier let me know and I will call Mari and she can watch them. Either way is fine....we are happy to help!

We did a little bit later in the morning shut down.  Can you guys watch Garret and Jackie for about 30 min this evening?  Gary needs to do a walk through at the house and I would rather they not be at home.
 
Thanks
 
Tracy

He is interested in the technology track or the analyst program. Is there anyone you could introduce him to? I believe he specified this in his objectives on his resume. Thanks so much for your help! Why are you at work? I thought Enron shut down?????

Ask him to look at Enron job postings to see if there is anything he is interested in.
I will see what I can do.

Tracy,
Here is Cal's resume. We would appreciate any help you could give him. He is available to come by and meet anyone you would think appropriate in the intern process. Please advise us what we should do next. He is working up here to get some experience but very interested in any prospects you might have at Enron. Thanks, Tracy!
Marsha
