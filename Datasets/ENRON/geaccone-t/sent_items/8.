ETS  103
PGG  28
EREC 53.2
Azurix (not including Marlin) (5.2)
Clean Fuels (21.1)  I need to double check this one this morning.

We talked about EGAS yesterday.  Its their 2nd CE plus ( in this case minus) the assets we have picked up.  We will review updated 4Q with Stan on Tuesday afternoon.

I will have to check with EEOS unless you already have.

Sorry for the delay, I had to talk to Rod.
