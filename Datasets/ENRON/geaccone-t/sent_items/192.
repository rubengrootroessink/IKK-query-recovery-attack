No problem on the reschedule. What about Thursday, Nov. 1?  Actually, Jackie is going to stay with her friend Claire.  But, Garret is very excited about staying with Jake.  Will that be ok?

Can we reschedule our glass of wine? I have been burning the candle at both ends and starting early and working late every night. We are still on for Saturday with the kids. Let me know when you want to bring them over. Also, lets pick a day next week for that glass of wine.
