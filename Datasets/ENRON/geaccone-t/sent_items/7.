I ordered the pastries.  I will bring them on Saturday.  Don't forget to make the ice cream.  I can't wait to be with you tomorrow.
I love you.

Good morning beautiful. I can't stop thinking about being with you and holding you. All night long all I could think about was how wonderful it is to hold and kiss you. You are so sweet and affectionate. I love it!

I have a slight sinus headache this morning but I hope it will go away after I take something for it. Can't wait to see you and touch you.

	Love,

		Your Seetheart
