Danny, Tracy,

Please see revised slides.  Steve is talking about TransPecos, so I didn't include in my bit.

Danny,

Please see the attached slides an Asset Dev.  Steve Dowd pulled the earlier slides that were included for Corp Dev. Let me know if you would like to make any modifications.  Tracey is working to a Monday deadline for Stan's book.
