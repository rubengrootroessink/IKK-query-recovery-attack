After reviewing the budget yesterday, we noticed that goodwill was still being
amortized in 2002. We need to take that out of your numbers. Jim and Kiri
thought it was approximately $14 million. Thus, PGG should have an IBIT of
$270. Please revise file and send back to me and copy Steve Schwarzbach
thanks.

Hi Tracy, 

Please see attached for the Plan that Stan Horton will be looking at tomorrow 
morning. This version includes Intercompany interest expense that was not 
previously budgeted. It also has a more detail break-out of capital 
expenditures. 

For the O&M detail pages, we will not be able to give you the same break-out 
for our cost as you have requested. Our GL is build on FERC accounts and is 
not condusive to SAP type sorting. 

Also, note that all O&M are at this point still straight lined for the year. 
The quarterly shaping of earnings will not be available until mid to late 
November. There will be significant swing between quarters from these results 
to the final one. 

Let me know if you have any questions.
