Tracy,
Here is Cal's resume. We would appreciate any help you could give him. He is available to come by and meet anyone you would think appropriate in the intern process. Please advise us what we should do next. He is working up here to get some experience but very interested in any prospects you might have at Enron. Thanks, Tracy!
Marsha
