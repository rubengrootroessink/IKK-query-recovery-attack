Tracy,
 
Amount of 2000 bonus' paid in 2001:  $16.74M
(The $16.61M reported by PGE employee Joyce Bell in HR was the recommended amount submitted to Corporate for approval.  The actual payouts differ by $130K due to upward adjustments made by Corporate to the recommended amounts.)
 
Accrual amount for 2001 bonus:  $13.0M

Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks, Valerie
