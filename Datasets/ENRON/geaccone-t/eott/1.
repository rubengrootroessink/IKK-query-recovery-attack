Please review the attached list of guarantees issued for unconsolidated subsidiaries.  Let me know of any changes.  Discuss this with your Arthur Andersen audit team so the report you provide them has the same guarantees as the consolidated list below. 

I need a response that the list is okay or any changes from you as soon as possible.



Jill
