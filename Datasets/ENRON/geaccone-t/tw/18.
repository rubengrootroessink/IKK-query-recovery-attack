I need to solicit your help for TW transport revenue variances for 1st qtr 01 compared to 1st qtr 00.
This is for the Enron 10Q report.  This information will be passed on to Traci Rainbow in ETS consolidation who will consolidate with other ETS companies and forward to the ENE Corp Reporting team to be utilized for earnings release.

Normally they would need explanations for the qtr ended and for year to date, but since the 1st qtr is same as year to date, only 1st qtr will be needed.

Sorry, for the short notice, I just  found out,  we are now responsible for gathering the infomation from here forward.
This infomation is needed by 3:00 pm tomorrow, Tuesday April 10.

I know you normally supply Aurora with the detailed variance explanations for the Noteholders and Browncovers each qtr.
For purposes of this Corp explanations, it is usually on a higher level.  But if time permits, you can supply a detail explanation and we can use this for purposes of the Qtr variances also, Just do what you can in this short time period.   Thanks  x37115

       YTD      @3/30/01                  @3/30/00          Variance
