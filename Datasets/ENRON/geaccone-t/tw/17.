Rod,
         It just keeps getting better and better.  I just found out that our TW drag reduceing project created 80,000 in new capacity, not 40,000.  But, as originally designed, the San Juan lateral could only transport 810,000/day rather than its certificated capacity of 850,000, and it was not designed to take into account fuel usage.  So, of the 80,000 of new capacity, 40,000 goes to bring it back to certificated levels  and 40,000 goes to compensate for fuel usage.  
         Phil is of the opinion that Stan knows all about it, and was surprised that there was any confusion.
