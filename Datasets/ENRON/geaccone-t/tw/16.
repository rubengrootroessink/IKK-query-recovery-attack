I made the following entry to accrue for the marketing support payment.

54005000 103991209999 G&A-Other          $142,000
30016000  AP Trade-3rd Party                    -  142,000

When the payment is ready to be made, the wire should be coded to AP Trade-3rd Party.

If there are any questions, please let me know.
 
Thanks, Debbie

Where do we usually accrue for these types of payments?

Debbie, accrue a liability for a market support payment to Southwestern Gas for $142,000, I assume you will charge TW's marketing cost center.

We need to set the reserve up for the full $142,000.

In January 2001, Transwestern had $127,750 revenue from speculative deals. Please set up a reserve for this amount in March 2001 as this will be offset by an unbudgeted market support payment to Southwest Gas Corporation in December 2001 of $142,000.

Thanks
