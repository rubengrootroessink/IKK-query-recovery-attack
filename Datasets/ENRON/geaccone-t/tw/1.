Jan:

I looked at your attachment and noted that you explained the variance of $8.7 MM but you did not indicate the breakdown of the revenues.  Can you please provide the composition of $150.3 for 2000 and $141.6 for 1999.   For example you can breakdown $150.3 and $ 141.6 into:

		Dec. 2000			Dec.1999	Variance
West  		$ xxxxxx		West  		$ xxxxxx		$10.2
East		   xxxxxx		East		   xxxxxx		( $2.8)
Ignacio		  xxxxxxx	Ignacio		  xxxxxxx	$1.3
San Juan 	xxxxxxxx	San Juan 	xxxxxxxx	xxx
Other		 xxxxxxx		Other		 xxxxxxx		xxx		
Total		$150.3		Total		$141.6		$8.7

Thanks.


Aurora
