At the recent Income Statement review, a issue was discussed regarding the volatility of  the encroachment account valued at the monthly index.  Currently, the balance in the encroachment account is 276,672 Dth valued at Feb. 01 index of $5.62.  The encroachment account is over and above the balance in the system balancing account of 1,925,572 Dth valued at $3.71.  
Accountings question for operations is concerning the balance in the encroachment account, is the balance a permanent increase in pack due to the operation of the pipe?  If so, can it be determined how much of the balance is permanent  and does it make since to move it to the system balancing gas account at Dec. 00 price?

Accounting would like to setup a meeting to discuss this issue during the week of Mar. 19-23(Dan's on vacation this week).  I'll be getting back to setup workable date and time.

Please let me know if you feel someone else should be included in this meeting and I'll forward this email on to them.

Thanks,

Debbie
