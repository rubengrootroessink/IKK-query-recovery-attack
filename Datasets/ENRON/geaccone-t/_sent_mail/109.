Mary,

We have received you SAP Security Request Form.  However, before we continue processing this request, I need you to confirm several PS roles you requested for your.  I noticed you selected the following additional PS roles: FN PS Project Controls Engineer, FN PS Project Budget Controller, and FN PS Master Data Entry with FN IM Capital Budget Controller for yourself.  These roles are considered incompatible roles, because the combinations of the roles should not be jointly assigned to a user, as such would compromise segregation of duties and is considered a business risk.  Do you want me to continue requesting these roles for you?  If so, I would need approval from the Chief Accounting Officer (CAO) of your Business Unit.

Attached below is the SAP Security-Internal Control Guidelines:

 

Please advise.

Thank you,
SAP Security (Eva)
