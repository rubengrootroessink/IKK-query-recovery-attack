Subject:	2001 Accounting costs

Please complete the attached schedule of the 2001 plan accounting costs and headcount.  The schedule should include the costs for all accounting, structuring and tax departments, but exclude mid-office support, customer services, etc.   Please e-mail me the completed schedule by the end of the Friday.  We will be presenting this information to Rick Causey on Monday.

Thanks
