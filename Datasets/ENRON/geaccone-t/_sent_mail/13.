Tracy, you may want to call Eric to get the location for this meeting.  I think this is the one Steve J was referring to and should encompass a majority of the outage costs for 2001.

In response to your comments made in Tuesday's TW Marketing Staff meeting regarding planned outages for TW CS 1 - 4, David Boothe and Jerry Graves have a meeting planned for Tuesday, 2/27, to discuss timelines, throughput affects, and work scope for each station.  The matrix of additional work that you have obtained is additional to the annual maintenance and safety device work that you are already aware of.  In lieu of performing major overhauls at each station due to the "Redrock Expansion," the additional work is slated to sustain existing equipment reliability and engine performance during the interim period.  The objective of David and Jerry's efforts on Tuesday will be to minimize downtime and throughput affects, and you will be kept advised for your bulletin posting requirements.  Feel free to contact Jerry with any questions or concerns you may have.
