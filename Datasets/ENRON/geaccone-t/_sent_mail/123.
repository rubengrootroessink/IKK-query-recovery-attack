>  Surprise!
>  It was the day before my eighteenth birthday. I was living at
>  home, but my parents had gone out for the evening, so I invited
>  my girlfriend over for a romantic night alone. As we lay in bed
>  after making love, we heard the telephone ring downstairs. I
>  suggested to my girlfriend that I give her a nude piggyback ride
>  to the phone. Since we didn't want to miss the call, we didn't
>  have time to get dressed. When we got to the bottom of the
>  stairs, the lights suddenly came on and a whole crowd of people
>  yelled, "SURPRISE!" My entire family: aunts, uncles,
>  grandparents, cousins and all my friends were standing there. My
>  girlfriend and I were frozen in a state of shock and
>  embarrassment for what seemed like an eternity. Since then, no
>  one in my family has planned a surprise party again.

>  One of the funniest "most-embarrassing-moment" stories I've come
>  upon in a long time was about a lady who picked up several items
>  at a discount store.  When she finally got up to the checker,
>  she learned that one of her items had no price tag. Imagine her
>  embarrassment when the checker got on the intercom and boomed
>  out for all the store to hear, "PRICE CHECK ON LANE THIRTEEN,
>  TAMPAX, SUPER SIZE." That was bad enough, but somebody at the
>  rear of the store apparently misunderstood the word "Tampax" for
>  "THUMBTACKS."  In a business-like tone, a voice boomed back over
>  the intercom. "DO YOU WANT THE KIND YOU PUSH IN WITH YOUR THUMB
>  OR THE KIND YOU POUND IN WITH A HAMMER?"

>  Mom's Advice
>  A teacher noticed that a little boy at the back of the class was
>  squirming around, scratching his crotch and not paying
>  attention. She went back to find out what was going on. He was
>  quite embarrassed and whispered that he had just recently been
>  circumcised and he was quite itchy. The teacher told him to go
>  down to the principal's office. He was to phone his mother and
>  ask her what he should do about it. He did it and returned to
>  his class.  Suddenly, there was a commotion at the back of the
>  room. She went back to investigate only to find him sitting at
>  his desk with his penis hanging out.  "I thought I told you to
>  call your mom." she screamed. "I did," he said, "And she told me
>  that if I could stick it out till noon, she'd come and pick me
>  up from school."
