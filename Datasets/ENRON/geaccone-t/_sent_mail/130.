I think everything is working for the Valentine's Day party. Julie backed
out on the activity, but Robin Burks and Lorraine Lewis are going to
oversee it. There is one problem though. The craft needs to be picked up
and paid for on Thursday morning after carpool in the cafeteria. Both Robin
and Lorraine are working and I will be in Chicago on business. Do you think
you could drop by there?
Thanks,
Karen
