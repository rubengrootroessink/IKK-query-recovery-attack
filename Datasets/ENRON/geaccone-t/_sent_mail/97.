Yes, the one we've all been waiting for... Darwin Awards 2000. They have  
finally been released! 

For those not familiar with the Darwin Award,  It's an annual honor given 
to the person who provided the Universal human  gene pool the biggest 
service by getting killed in the most extraordinarily  stupid way. As 
always, competition this year has been keen again. Some  candidates 
appear to have trained their whole lives for this event!  

DARWIN AWARD CANDIDATES 
1. In September in Detroit, a 41-year-old  man got stuck and drowned in 
two feet of water after squeezing head first  through an 18-inch-wide = 
sewer 
grate to retrieve his car keys.  

2. In October, a 49-year-old San Francisco stockbroker, who "totally =  
zoned 
when he ran," according to his wife, accidentally jogged off a =  
100-foot-high 
cliff on his daily run. 

3. Buxton, NC: A man died  on a beach when an 8-foot-deep hole he had dug 
into the sand caved in as he  sat inside it. Beach goers said Daniel = 
Jones, 
21 dug the hole for fun,  or protection from the wind, and had been = 
sitting 
in a beach chair at  the bottom Thursday afternoon when it collapsed, 
burying him beneath 5 feet  of sand. People on the beach, on the outer 
banks, used their hands and  shovels, trying to claw their way to Jones, 
a resident of Woodbridge, VA,  but could not reach him. It took rescue 
workers using heavy equipment almost  an hour to free him while about 200 
people looked on. Jones was pronounced  dead at a hospital. 

4. In February, Santiago Alvarado, 24, was killed in  Lompoc, CA, as he 
fell face-first through the ceiling of a bicycle shop he  was 
burglarizing. Death was caused when the long flashlight he had placed in  
his mouth (to keep his hands free) rammed into the base of his skull as  
he hit the floor. 

5. According to police in Dahlonega, GA, ROTC  cadet Nick Berrena, 20, 
was stabbed to death in January by fellow cadet  Jeffrey Hoffman, 23, who 
was trying to prove that a knife could not  penetrate the flak vest = 
Berrena 
was earing. 

6. Sylvester  Bridal, JR, 26, was killed in February in Selbyville, Del, 
as he won a bet  with friends who said he would not put a revolver loaded 
with four bullets  into his mouth and pull the trigger. 

7. In February, according to police  in Windsor, Ontario, Daniel Kolta, 
27, and Randy Taylor, 33, died in a  head-on collision, thus earning a 
tie in the game of chicken they were  playing with their snowmobiles. 

DARWIN AWARD HONORABLE MENTIONS  

1. In Guthrie, Okla, in October, Jason Heck tried to kill a millipede =  
with 
a shot from his 22-caliber rifle, but the bullet ricocheted off of  a = 
rock 
near the hole and hit pal Antonio Martinez in the head,  fracturing his 
skull. 

2. In Elyria, Ohio, in October, Marty Eskins,  attempting to clean out 
cobwebs in his basement, declined to use a broom in  favor of a propane 
torch and caused a fire that burned the first and second  floors of his 
house. 

3. Paul Stiller, 47, was hospitalized in  Andover Township, NJ, in 
September, and his wife Bonnie was also injured, by  a quarter-stick of 
dynamite that blew up in their car. While driving around  at 2 AM, the 
bored couple lit the dynamite and tried to toss it out the  window to see 
what would happen, but they apparently failed to notice that  the window 
was closed. 

4. TACOMA, WA - Kerry Bingham, had been  drinking with several friends 
when one of them said they knew a person who  had bungee-jumped from 
the Tacoma Narrows Bridge in the middle of traffic.  The conversation = 
grew 
more heated and at least 10 men trooped along  the walkway of the bridge 
at 4:30am. 
Upon arrival at the midpoint of the  bridge they discovered that no one 
had brought a bungee rope. Bingham, who  had continued drinking, = 
volunteered 
and pointed out that a coil of  lineman's cable lay nearby. One end of  = 
the 
cable was secured  around Bingham's leg and the other end was tied to the 
bridge. His fall  lasted 40 feet before the cable tightened and tore his 
foot off at the  ankle. He miraculously survived his fall into the icy 
river water and was  rescued by two nearby fishermen. "All I can say," 
said Bingham, "is that God  was watching out for me on that night. 
There's just no other explanation for  it." Bingham's foot was never 
located. 

AND NOW, FOR THE WINNER:  

1. PADERBORN, GERMANY - Overzealous zookeeper Friedrich Riesfeldt  
fed his constipated elephant Stefan 22 doses of animal laxative and more  
than a bushel of berries, figs and prunes before the plugged up =  
pachyderm 
finally let fly - and suffocated the keeper under 200 pounds  of poop! 
Investigators say ill-fated Friedrich, 46, was attempting to give  the 
ailing elephant an olive oil enema when the relieved beast unloaded on =  
him 
like a dump truck full of mud. "The sheer force of the elephant's  
unexpected defecation knocked Mr. Riesfeldt to the ground, where he =  
struck 
his head on a rock and lay unconscious as the elephant continued  to 
evacuate his bowels on top of him," said flabbergasted Paderborn police  
detective Erik Dern. With no one there to help him, he lay under all  
that dung for at least an hour before a watchman came along, and during =  
that 
time he suffocated. "It seems to be just one of those freak  accidents 
that happen."
