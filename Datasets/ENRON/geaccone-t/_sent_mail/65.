I will call everyone and remind them about Sat. at 9:00 and I will get shirt orders and money on Sat.  Let me know what size you will need.

Thanks

Blue, white, and orange are the colors.  I think blue or orange would be  
good. Cliff and Lee will commit to one apiece.    Also you may want to call  
all the parents about the practice shirts and remind them of the changed  
practice time this Saturday which starts at 9am. Thanks Tracy!   CLR
