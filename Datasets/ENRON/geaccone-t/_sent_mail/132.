Updates....



Corporate Overhead allocations are complete.
EGF Assessments are complete.
ENA Research Group Assessments are complete.
CATS entries for prior month were posted and final hours were transferred to CO and PS. 

Due to Labor Distribution valuation issues, True-Up postings are being postponed in order to allow time to analyze and correct the errors. We will evaluate our progress on Monday morning and provide you with an update in the close meeting.  Best case scenario we will begin running allocations on Monday afternoon. 

See you at 9am CST EB48C2 on Monday.
