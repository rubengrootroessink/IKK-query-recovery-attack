Judy,  Will you please look in the attached cost centers and let me know when ETS began receiving payroll charges for the employees listed and compare that to the effective dates that Greg has listed.  We are trying to determine what we owe EE&CC due to delays in the employee transfers.

Thanks for your help,
Elaine
