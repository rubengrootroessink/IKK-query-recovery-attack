Tracy -

Would you happen to have the information EES is asking for? They need 1-3Q for 2000 throughput... see attached power point presentation below...

Thanks!

Kimberly:

Attached is the info I need from you (the data on the far left - green graph) to update for the EES All Employee Meeting this Friday.  As I'm sure you are aware, this is an urgent request.

I appreciate your prompt attention,
Rana
