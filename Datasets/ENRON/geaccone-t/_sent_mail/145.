This unfortunately is true.  We, ETS, have agreed to an amount which is flat to previous years.  The IT has new managment in, primarily Kerry Roper formerly Clean Fuels, to try to fix or actually create a billing system similar to what we had.  Rod and Steve Hotte have been involved in this.  At this point in time, there is not a better alternative.

Hello, Tracy!    I am curious (and somewhat concerned because they are ALWAYS overcharging me for items I don't have or don't use!) about Paige's second paragraph.   Are her statements true?    And if so, who is going to "police" this to make sure that we are actually getting what we're paying for?

Cindy

Hi Cindy,

Looks like we've gotten to the bottom of the billing issue. The IT billing group is going to refund you $360.00 for erroneous charges over the last year. I had them audit your bill, and they sent me a list of the things that shouldn't have been billed in the first place, and this is the amount you are due. You should notice it on your January bill. Please let me know if you do not see this (you'll probably get the bill in Feb.)

Secondly, the billing system is being changed as of Feb 1. Now that we are using the SAP system, you will no longer receive an itemized bill. All IT charges will be sent to the business unit, at a pre allocated/predetemined amount. This amount was agreed to by all business units. Basically everyone will be billed a single amount for all IT usage, and the Business Unit will be charged, not the individual.

The only things you will be billed for are as follows:
Long distance charges
Market Data Application charges

These things can actually be traced back to the individual(s).

This should make life much simpler.

I apologize, again, for the delay in handling this situation.

Paige
