James Weitekamp who works for me sent out my full year planning calendar last week via e-mail.  I have asked him to resend to you.

Interesting.  Who put a notice out on the Feb 23rd meeting ?  I do not have the meeting on Danny's calendar and unfortunately he is out of town that week.  I have gone through my meeting files and do not have any information.

Does Danny want his VPs at the meeting with Stan on Feb. 23?
