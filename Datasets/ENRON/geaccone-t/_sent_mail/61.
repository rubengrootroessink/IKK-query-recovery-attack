Welcome back.  All the statistical data is on the Investor relations website.  I don't have an extra one.  They are in the kitchen on 49.   Investor relations drafts that supplement and has in the past worked with me to get any data they don't already have and to review the content.

Hi Tracy!

How are things going?  I'm slowly getting back in the groove!

I am currently working with the Annual Report writer on the ETS portion of the book.  Do you know who drafts the copy for the Enron statistical report?   Also, may I get a copy of the 1999 statistical report from you?

Thanks for your help.

Gina
