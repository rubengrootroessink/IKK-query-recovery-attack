Elaine forwarded the functional IBIT statement (sent by James W)  to me today.  I was wondering if we could now meet  for a couple of hours to discuss the transition issues.  I will be in Houston on Wednesday, February 7th.  I would like to meet with you or your representative sometime in the Morning (I suggest 9:00 to 11:00).

Please let me know as soon as possible so we can book a room. 

Thanks

I would rather we wait until the funtional income statements are complete.  I need to review with Rod and we will have some minor adjustments to make.  I will set up a meeting when we are ready.  It will probably be towards the end of next week.  We can also discuss the quarter forecast

Thanks

Tracy

 Dana Jones and I met with Steve Kleb last week for about 3 hours to go over the NNG Earnings model.  It was somewhat overwhelming  and I could easily see how it could absorb one or more full time equivalent.  I think there is still a great deal that is undefined right now regarding the amount of effort required to keep that model updated.   Some observations/comments.:
Who will take the lead on updating the earnings model for actual?  Is this more of an Accounting responsilbility than Planning ? .  From talking to Steve Kleb its pretty clear that a significant amount of work is involved in getting actual accounting entries at an account level and splitting it into separate business events.
Depreciation - Will Property Accounting take the lead in all aspects of the depreciation.  My impression is that this would be a change from  historical responsibilities.

OTHER QUESTIONS:

Who are the experts on these items?
Carrying charges 
Trackers
Other Income
Taxes


What are the deadlines for reporting legal entity and functional IBIT ( I assume the first quarter forecast is the next one)

I will be in Houston on  1/30 and hoping that we could get together for a couple of hours.  I am hoping we can start defining deadlines and deliverables for our respective groups.  

Please let me know  if you are available on Tuesday 1/30
