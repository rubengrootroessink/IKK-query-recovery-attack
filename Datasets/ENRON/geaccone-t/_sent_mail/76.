I like the reports.  I think we need a input section where it lists data by contract/shipper where we can manipulate and add  data for weekly/daily deals.  I also would like for there to be a section to extend to outer years.  We also need to the far right of the monthly a quarterly sum.

Some IT people will be joining us at 4:00 today.

Thanks 

Tracy
