I called everyone today.  The trip is to the ZOO.  I will let you know if anyone can't make it.  I have spoken to some and left messages for other.

Hi Tracy,
Do we know what the March 7th field trip is? I guess we need to start
contacting volunteers soon. I can't believe this month is already over!!!!
This school year is flying by.
