Not really, because assessments are run at the end of the month only.  We can bill 584 and then you guys can make an entry to move 1/2 to 012?

Tracy,
Is it possible to have the first half of the month flow to 584 and the second half to 012?  Please let me know.
Thanks,
Karen

We will bill in February the full amount.  We will not bill any charges in March unless services are being provided.  
This should apply to the Corporate charges as well.  The corporate charges should not be reallocated amongst only ETS companies.  They should be spread across all Enron Business units.

Thanks

Tracy

Effective 2/16/01, approximately 65 employees will move over to HPL Co. 0012.  Please have Corporate and ETS charges to Co. 0584 stop as soon as possible as we will not be able to charge them to ENA.  These should be charged instead to Co. 0012.

Karen, if you have any specific comments on this please let me know as soon as possible.
