I think we should show margins and expense and come down to net contribution.  I think it be important to maintain the margin stuff separately.  We also should show the assets sales and others separately.

Tracy, I agree.  We just weren't there yet last week when we met with Danny.  

Tracy and Steve, I want to substitute "Net Contribution Commercial" for the Net Margin on my combination schedule.  Do you have the other line items by Quarter that you can come to a Net Contribution Commercial number?
