I can speak on your behalf.  I have left your numbers flat to plan.  You might want to sit in just to see how he wants to handle this going forward and how all of this fits together.  I will be sending you the schedules within the next few minutes.

It appears there's a meeting this afternoon with Stan.  Do I need to attend?

This year we will be looking at the income statement on a functional basis rather than a legal entity basis.  As such, it is important the you and/or your functional unit coordinator (BUC) attend these meetings.  Your BUC should be meeting with you prior to these meetings to review your numbers.  We sent a planning calendar out last week which shows when these meetings are scheduled.  You do not need to attend the pre-meetings.  

Our first meeting with Stan for the first quarter is on Friday, February 23 at 3:30 in 49C2.

Please let me know if you did not receive the calendar or could not find it on the intranet.
