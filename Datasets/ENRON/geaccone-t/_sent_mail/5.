I need this paid right away!!  I sent an e-mail out to you last month on this.  The expense needs to go against the environmental reserve on 1N9.  Please let me know the status.

Bob,

I have checked with Sandy Sheffield in credit and she says that Enron Liquid Services has not yet paid that $16,000.00.  Could you please give Tracy Geaccone a call.  We would like to get that off the books.  Thanks for all your help.

Karen
