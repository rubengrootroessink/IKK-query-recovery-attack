Stan has not directed me to do so.  He is the one who told me to send the $15,000. It is not really a % of anything.  Its your call.

We are invoiced  $15,000 every month as an allocation of Stan's salary to EOTT.  We are currently working on the compensation section of EOTT's 10-K and I need to know if we are going to be allocated any of Stan's bonus and if so, what that amount will be because I will have to disclose the amount.  I figured you were the best person for me to ask.  If there is someone else I should talk to just let me know.  Thanks for the help.
