Subject:	AA PBC Requests for 10-K

Traci,

As I'm sure you are aware, Corp has moved up the filing of their 10-K to Feb. 16th.  We must have all of our audit work (with the exception of some post-10K items) completed by this date, including our 10-K review and our normal quarterly review.  I am in the process of sending out PBC requests for items we will need in order to finish our work.  Items pertinent to your group are listed below.  Note that these items are PBCs we normally receive from you each quarter.  

EOTT Calculation for 4th Qtr earnings release (we have already discussed this item)
ETS Consolidated Balance Sheet as of 12/31/00
ETS Consolidated Income Statement for 4th Qtr '00 YTD (we need the updated statement)
ETS Cash Flow Squeeze (3rd Qtr schedules are attached for your reference)
    

Please let me know if you have any questions and if there will be any significant delays in obtaining these items.  We would like these items as soon as they are available.  Thanks Traci.

Tony - AA
