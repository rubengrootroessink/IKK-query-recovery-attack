If you don't mind that would help out. Does that mean you would stay at my house tonight? Do you need to go home and get your things? I can't wait to see you again.

I can't wait to see you tonight.  If you have alot of things to do at home, I don't mind driving to your house after Jackie's conference.   I have an Azurix 2002 Plan review from 2:30-4:30, so I will not be at your staff meeting.  I should be around until then.

Love you,
