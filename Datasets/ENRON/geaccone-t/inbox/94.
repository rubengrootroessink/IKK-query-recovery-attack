Subject:Request: Current Headcount 

Hi everyone. I have yet another request for which I need your input. Causey is
reviewing his budgets/direct reports, and would like to get the most current
headcount numbers for the accounting groups in your business unit(s). 

What I mean by accounting groups includes everyone whose superior ultimately
reports to Causey. For instance, this would include the traditional
Accounting/Reporting departments, Tax departments, and Transaction Support
departments. It should NOT include any settlements/mid-office groups (for
example, Sally Beck's world). I say "department" because I don't want just
accountants, but everyone who is in that dept, i.e. admins, clerks, etc. If
you have a question on any unique situation, please just give me a call and
we'll discuss. 

The data needs to be as recent as possible. Hopefully, I can get this as of
July 31/August 1. If you have more recent data, that would be great. At a bare
minimum, I need total headcount as described by group (acct, reporting, tax,
etc.) It would also be useful to get as much detail as possible, i.e. by
sub-group, by personnel level, etc., but I know that may be a challenge given
the timing of the request. 

Additionally, if you can provide me with a "current estimate" for the groups
you report, that would be ideal. I know that the official CE doesn't go to
that level, but I'm betting that most of you have something that projects your
G&A by cost center (or group/dept) for 2001, as of the 2nd CE. 

The headcount information is a must have, and the 2001 cost estimate is
secondary, although I'd like to ask everyone to strive to provide both. If you
can't provide estimated costs for the groups you report, please call me so we
can discuss. 

Speaking of the timing, I need this by Wednesday, August 29 at 12 noon. This
will be given to Rick on Thursday morning, so I'll need some time to
consolidate the data and to ask you all any further questions. 

If you have any questions, please give me a call. 

Thanks, 
Steve
