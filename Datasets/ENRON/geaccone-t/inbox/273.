We want to remind you of a few upcoming events for your calendar:

Book Fair
*	Oct. 17th, 6-8 PM is Family Night.   Enjoy Mrs. Nikki's delicious
spaghetti dinner (tickets must be purchased in advance) and the opportunity
to shop for books and CDs with your family.
*	Please feel free to join your children as their class attends the
Book Fair on Oct. 18th at 1:00 PM.   They will have 30 minutes to make a
selection so it helps the hosts/hostesses to have a few extra hands.
