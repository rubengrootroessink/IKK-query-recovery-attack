Hi Tracy,
earlier this week you mentioned you might email out earnings targets
this week.  I have not yet received them from you.  I will be on
vacation all next week, so if the targets are set or you have any
information to forward us, please copy Dee and he will reply to you or
route the information as needed.

Have a nice weekend, jb
