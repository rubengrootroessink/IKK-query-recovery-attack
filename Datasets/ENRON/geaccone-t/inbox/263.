Tracy,
Is there such a thing that we need to do for you.  If yes, could I get the template from you.  I don't think our G&A will change.  Thanks.

One item which falls under Item 6)  -  at the meeting Rod said that they have standard G & A graph template that they use.

Agatha -  you should probably see if you can get something from Tracy

While I had a free minute, I was trying to remember the action items from the EGAS Plan review with Horton.  I will list what I can remember but please edit and add as needed.

1) Roll forward from 2001 2nd CE to 2002 plan by asset
2) Updated Cuiaba numbers
3) Updated European Numbers including E Power
4) Final Currency Reserve number from Louie Fisher ( current 10 million place holder)
5) An "Exposures/Issues Currently Managing" Schedule by Project  ( see attached schedule format)
6) Coordinate the format of EGAS Lay presentation with the rest of ETS
7) Revised Asset Sale slide from Fisher
