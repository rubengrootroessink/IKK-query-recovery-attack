Pam-

The following is a summary of estimated costs for the remodel and occupancy of Levels 39-46 in ECN. These are present estimates and ETS would receive formal, hard budgets at project inception and only be charged actual costs:

Construction:  $3,500,000
Design:  $350,000
Churn: $250,000
Furniture:  $1,150,000
Contingency: $250,000

Total:  $5,500,000

Please feel free to set a meeting time with Tara should you want to discuss details.
