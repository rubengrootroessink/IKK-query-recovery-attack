Per our telephone conversations, property tax information for the budget process is only needed for the calendar years 2001 and 2002.

In order to complete the property tax portion of this process and provide the cash flow analysis for Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company, the Property Tax Department needs the following information for the calendar year 2001:

(1) Net Utility Operating Income (Net Income before Interest & Taxes) 
(2) Capital Expenditures (Income Enhancement/Marketing Projects only): preferably by state, if not; total by company

In order to provide the required information in a timely manner, please forward the aforementioned information to my attention as soon as it becomes available. If you have any other questions or comments, please advise.
