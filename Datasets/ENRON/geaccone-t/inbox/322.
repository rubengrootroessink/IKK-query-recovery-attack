eSource is based on your current year usage as a percentage of total current year usage.  The amount is simply a guideline and charges will only be incurred if you use eSource in 2002.

The additional amount for IT Infrastructure relates to a passthrough to Other Business Units of Infrastructure charges allocated to ENA from ENW.  The basis for this is a calculation of FTE's based on 2002 Planned allocations from ENA support departments to your business unit.  You are then charged a % of that support department's Infrastructure charges applicable to the FTE's.

Please let me know if you have any further questions.

Thanks,
Edie

	Edie,
	Can you give us more information on these additional costs.  What is the "esource" and why the additional expense for the IT Infrastructure?  Thank you.
	Mary

Attached, please find an updated allocations schedule which now reflects in a separate line the planned IT Infrastructure Allocation related to each support department that will be passed on to each Business Unit from ENA for 2002.

Also attached is related support:
