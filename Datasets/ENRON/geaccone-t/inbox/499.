Tracy:

Attached is the revised 4th Qtr Forecast Summary.

Also, attached is the expense analysis I did.  Please note, I did not include UAF.

I have compared our actual numbers with James' spreadsheet and Steve Kleb's earnings model.  Once I made that adjustment for the $244 reserve in August on James' spreadsheet, we are all in agreement that the YTD actuals for TW commercial is $162.7.  I have also verified that number with Robert Miller and he agrees that is the number reflected on the Income Statement.

The $244 reserve reversal was made in September and reflected in the transport margins revenues.
