Lori -

Sorry I didn't get this to you earlier today, but I was hung up on Enron 3rd qtr deals all weekend and didn't get a chance to work on it until tonight.  I did check it for consistency with Andersen's documentation and everything is consistent.  FYI - I promised Andersen that I would return their original documentation without retaining or distributing any copies, so I will not have their documentation in any company files.  Let me know if you have any questions (713-853-7046).  Thanks.

Mary
