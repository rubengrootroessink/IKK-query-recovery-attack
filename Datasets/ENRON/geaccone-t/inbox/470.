Let me give you my thoughts.
We acquired MGT on April 30.  If you include O&M expenses prior to that period of time you will be including all of the MGT salaries, allocations and overheads for which we had no responsibility.
El Paso, through the transition services agreement, is performing the accounting functions for MGT.  Each month someone in my department provides to them actual expenses paid through Enron that need to be recorded as O&M on MGT.  These are additive to those expenses processed through the El Paso system.  
I believe you should be picking up actuals from May 1 forward.

Subject:	Forecast for MGT

At Third Current Estimate, we added a full year forecast for MGT for Operations and added the MGT and Border amounts together on the Border page in the ETS Functional Income Statement as instructed.

We are trying to confirm what we should be reflecting.  Jason is being instructed that ETS should not pick up any actuals for January through May, and that we should use Actuals received from El Paso for June forward, and not our numbers.  The El Paso amounts for June through September are close to what we have, but not exact.

Please advise us as to what we should be reflecting and we will revise our schedules.  We did not pick up MGT at all until 3rd CE, so I'm OK with restating 3rd CE to reflect the appropriate amounts for MGT and rolling forward from there.

Thanks,  Elaine
