Tracy is losing most of her TW team to other jobs.   Palu is going to Opera=
tions Support for a promotion, Jeanette Doll is going to the Rates crew and=
 Jan Moore has expressed a desire to make a change as well (I think I have =
those all straight).   I would like to consider this a development opportun=
ity for someone on the high potential list to see what they can do in a dif=
ferent role.    The role is important as it is the key representative of ou=
r group facing the TW commercial team full time, Tracy needs to be able to =
count on this person to lead when she is not available.   The names that co=
me to mind off that list are Henry Baker, Dana Jones, Sophie Patel, Greg Sc=
hlender, Deelyn Pool, and Robert Geheb.     I would like Tracy to interview=
 these people (by phone if necessary)  and to decide who should be offered =
this opportunity.    If there is someone on this list that you no longer su=
pport as a high potential employee, please let the group know ASAP.   If th=
ere is someone else on the list that we need to consider please let us know=
 as well.

For Brian and Laura: Could you make any recommendations from the ETS lists?
