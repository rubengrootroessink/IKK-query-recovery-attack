The qtr forecast and CE due dates have been moved up from the original calendar each month.  Don't you plan to continue that into the 4th quarter.

I show the following:
3CE due Sept. 13
4th Qtr Fcst due Oct. 15
4th Qtr Fcst due Nov. 12
4th Qtr Fcst due Dec. 10
Final Plan presentations due Oct. 31

Can you confirm that these are current dates?

Thanks!  EC

Thanks!  Tracy,  Can you review the dates for the remainder of the year and let me know of any review or due date revisions.  If any of the 4th quarter due dates have been moved up, I will need to reschedule my due dates and reviews with Phil as soon as possible.

Morris,  I will send out a revised Planning Calendar to the coordinators as soon as I get the revisions from Tracy.

Thanks!  Elaine

Amelia,

I was reviewing the Plan Calendar after I heard about Phil's Director's conference.  Tracy has a 2002 Plan Review with Stan scheduled for October 10th, which conflicts with Phil's Directors Conference scheduled for October 9th through 11th.  Tracy has her calendar of Reviews with Stan on the intranet for the rest of the year.  You may want to be sure they are on Phil's Calendar.  Below is a link to Tracy's ETS Planning Calendar of due dates and reviews.

Tracy, is Stan's review still set for the 10th?  If it is a firm date, do you think there will be further discussions regarding Operations by that time since we are reviewing O&M and Capital on September 5th.

Thanks,  Elaine
