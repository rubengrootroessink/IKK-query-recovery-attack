I am in Germany on Nov 1 but will call in.  Let me know what time Stan wants to do the dry run (I will be 7 hours ahead of Houston; it would be best for me if I could call after 8 pm German time).  I know we will only have 20 minutes with Ken per business unit.  After sitting through my presentation to Stan, I would appreciate your recommendations on what we should focus on for EREC.  Thanks. Adam
