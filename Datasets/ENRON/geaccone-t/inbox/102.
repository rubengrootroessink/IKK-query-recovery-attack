I wanted to let  you know about a few things that are scheduled this week 
for the soccer team.  First of all,  we will distribute uniforms this 
Wednesday at practice.  I will also have picture forms available for 
everyone to fill out and pictures are scheduled for  Sunday, Sept. 9  at 
1:00 PM.  (Need to be ready to go at 12:45 at Pershing Middle School.)    I 
would like for the forms to be returned  at the game on Friday evening so I 
can fill out the order form for the team before Sunday.  The first game for 
the Tornados will be held this Friday at  6:30 PM  Field 6  (be there at 
6:15 for warm-up)   I will also have a  signup sheet for snacks after the 
games if everyone thinks we want to do this.     Let me know if  there is a 
question.   Thanks.  Janet Rowley   Home # 713-667-7846
Cell # 713-302-2171.
