As we collaboratively worked with the ENW team to put Pipeline Capacity on EnronOnline we worked through annual maintenance costs for each of the ETS pipes to participate in the offering.  You and Philippe then had further discussions refining that figure.  As we work on budgets do you mind refreshing me with the annual EnonOnline maintenance cost per pipe that you and Philippe had agreed to.

Thank you.
