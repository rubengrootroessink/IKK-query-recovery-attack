Hughes is a real piece of work.    I thought you should be aware of this.

I think I have this covered.    The issue is with Corp. planning and their requests, not the other Corp groups and Tracy and I have taken care of that.    Jeff didn't take it the way Jim has, in fact he welcomed the idea.    Jeff has told me that dealing with Jim might be an "experience".    Maybe you should ask Jim to raise the issue with me, or alternatively just let him know that you would like to be aware of the numbers before they go to Corp, which is all Tracy asked for.     Do you see "the tone of the message is demeaning" in Tracy's message?    Just curious.

Stan:
 
I would like to discuss the below message when you have a chance.  There has been a lot of distrust and concern over "managed information" with respect to the international assets.  My team has overcome this by going out of our way to cooperate and be transparent with corp the last year and a half.  I am uncomfortable asking my people not to respond to corp requests for information.  I also think the tone of the message is demeaning and could have a morale impact on my folks.
 
Jim

Please make sure your numbers go through me or Stan before we give them to Corp. Corp's request for these things should be coming through me in the future.   Rod and I are meeting with Stan on Monday, October 22.  We would like to discuss your 4th Q numbers then if possible.

Let me know. 

Thanks 

Tracy

Mark, 

In response to your voicemail this morning, this is EGAS 4th Qtr per the 2nd CE.  It has been adjusted to pull out the items that have been transferred out of EGAS since the 2nd CE  ( Azurix International and South America Merchant ) and the transfer in of European Assets and the Middle East.   This does NOT include EPower which I understand will be transferred from Europe to EGAS in the 4th Qtr.   We are currently working on our 3rd CE and will send you those numbers when we are done.
