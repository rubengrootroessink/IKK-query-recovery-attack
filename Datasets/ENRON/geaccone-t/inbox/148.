Steve,

The last cash flow you sent on Aug 20, 2001 showed we would spend $41.5 million on the Red Rock Expansion in 2001. This cash flow shows $30 million to be spent in 2001. We will be include the difference of $ 72 million and 2001 forecast in the 2002 Capital Plan as a carryover. Please confirm the 2001 cash flow.

Palu
