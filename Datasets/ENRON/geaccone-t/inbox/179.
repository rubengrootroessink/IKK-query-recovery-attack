Tracy,
A portion of the $200k cost is for an EWS team which does Mergers, Aquisitions, and Divestitures(MAD) work.  ETS' allocated cost is approximately $50K for the MAD team but we will only pay for actual charges in 2002 if we use the team.

Tracy,
There is a team in Enron Wholesale Services Human Resources which is dedicated to PEP/PRC design and administration.  The Human Resources charge of $200K to ETS is an allocation of the PEP/PRC team's cost.

I need to understand what services you are providing and to what group within ETS.

Thanks

Attached please find a schedule of planned allocations from ENA to other Business units.  Please review those allocations to your business unit (ETS) and provide positive confirmation of your agreement.
