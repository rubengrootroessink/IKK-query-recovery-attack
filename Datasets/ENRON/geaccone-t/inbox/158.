Subject:  West U Soccer's New Skill Development Program



Dear Coaches,

In an effort to continue the development  of the West U Soccer program to
become one of the finest in the city, we have  introduced some innovative
ways to provide the players with greater development  while having fun.

This year we have already introduced once  a week training for all players
who participate in the West U Soccer in house  programs.  From the reaction
I have  received to date this has been very successful.  We plan to
continue to make improvement  in this program to make it the finest in the
city.

In pursuit of this goal, West U Soccer is  sponsoring in conjunction with
Nebo Pro Soccer Academy a skill development  program for our players from
U-6 through U-19.

The goals of this program:

?      To provide players in  their development years the ability to
develop the skills necessary to enjoy the  game.

?      Have fun while  learning

?      Play fun games and  play against other competition.

?      Coach mentoring by  association with pro trainers

Last week was a trial run of the clinic  and I have a child who is a U-6
player.   He had a great time and learned a lot about soccer and wants to
go next  week because he had so much fun.

Nebo has done a great job of developing a  curriculum for all types of
player from the serious to the recreational.  He has assembled a staff of
trainers who  are well recognized.

If you have players who may be interested  in the training, I strongly
recommend that you hand out the attached sign-up  sheet at your next
practice.

Please tell the player who are interested  to bring the form on Sunday
September 23 at 5:00 to West U Elementary Field for  sign-up.

Thank you for your consideration on this matter .
