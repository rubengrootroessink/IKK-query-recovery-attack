I wanted to give Causey a heads up on our 2nd current estimate especially the major variance in PGE.  I understand we narrowed the variance but have not received infor on how.  Could you just have a one page schedule which lists for ETS, EW, PGE, Clean Fuels and Wessex the 3rd quarter forecast per the 2nd current estimate versus the last current estimate or plan and the 3rd quarter of last year with a variance explanation?

This is a meeting that I think you asked Tracy for.    Do you know what you want to cover?
