The Pain Care Center, 713-623-2478 ext.203.  My friend's name is Marsha Hughes. She owns it.  I told her the other day that you would be calling her.  You will have to ask where they are located.  I have to run, I am busy submitting questions to
 e-speak.

I love you.

Do you have the name and number of the place you told me about for the physical therapy and massage? I love you. It has been so great to spend time with you.
