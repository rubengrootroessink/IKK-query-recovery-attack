I am confused, you said below you wanted to go first so I assumed that meant first thing in the morning.  What about
 3:30-5:00?

I thought you told me afternoon, between 3:00 and 5:00?  We will probably be conferencing in California and 8:30 is too early.

I think we should be held to forty five minutes to an hour.  If you think he really wants a detailed review we could go two hours.

I have it on the calendar for 10/12.  If we could go first that would be our preference.

Let me know.
