Tracy-

I will see if we have any updates, although I doubt we would change the number from last we met.  I believe the presentation of the numbers has caused some confusion.  We are forecasting a (5.2) recurring loss, plus a (13.8) loss on Marlin, totaling (19.0) loss.  I think you added the 19 and the 5.2 to get to the 24.2 you have listed below.  The correct total is (19.0).
