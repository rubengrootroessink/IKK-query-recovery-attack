Tracy,

Omaha needs me to be onsite to help them complete there O&M model.  Rita was able to help them make the model changes they required, but they need someone to explain and train them in the use of the entire model and dataflow.  I am planning on spending next week in Omaha.  Please let me know if you have any concerns.

Hoang Vo
