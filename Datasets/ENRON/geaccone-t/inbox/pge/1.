Portland General Group variance for Q2 2001 vs Q2 2000
 
IBIT was basically flat, reflecting only a $2.6 million increase over the prior year quarter.  The main drivers were increased gross margin due to wholesale sales at a higher price, offset by increased expenses (plant maintenance costs, energy efficiency expenditures, MMF Q1 catch-up, Power Cost Adjustment and GATX leasing portfolio termination fee).
