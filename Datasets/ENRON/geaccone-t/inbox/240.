I was tied up in some other meetings and wasn't able to attend.  Do we have the final info, detail and presentation package for next Friday with Stan?  How about "Stan frequently asked question response? "  MK

We are meeting briefly with Danny this afternoon in EB 1336.  Let Audrey know if you want to call in.  We can e-mail you something.

Thanks
