Use $4,800 so there will be no surprises. That includes fixed and variable. 
The budget has not been approved yet, there could be an increase, but I feel confident with the $4,800 estimate.

Caroline,  What I been told is the following:

	$3,775/hr  fixed costs plus variable costs associated with specific trips i.e. fuel, landing fees, catering etc.

Typically I think an average per hour cost of $4,500 is used.

Gary,  Does this sound reasonable for budgeting purposes?

Dana

For the 2002 Plan NNG will budget aviation by function i.e commercial, operations etc.  Therefore each functional area needs to assess their company plane usage and budget accordingly for 2002.

Gary,  Once we have rolled each functional area up to the NNG legal entity level we will be able to provide you with the total NNG aviation budget for 2002.
