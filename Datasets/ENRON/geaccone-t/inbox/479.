Privileged and Confidential
for Discussion and
Settlement Purposes only




Yesterday, Maria and I spoke with Georgetta Baker, Counsel for SoCal Gas.  We proposed the settlement offer reflected in the attachment to this email.  We walked Georgetta through the details of the offer and the support for its reasonableness.  Georgetta, at the time of our conversation, did not have the written offer reflected in the attachment, however, we will provide her the written offer this morning.  Georgetta was very appreciative of our offer and said she would discuss the same with her clients on Tuesday.  (Apparently, her main clients are at the Transwestern Customer Meeting today and will be out as a result of Veterans Day on Monday.)  Once we hear back from SoCal Gas we will advise.
