FYI - If this request is approved, the reclassification/reporting of AFUDC Equity within Other Income-Other should result in an additional $700K to IBIT for 2001 (NNG $500K, TW $200K).

Request to remap the below two SAP accounts for AFUDC equity from hyperion account 1755 (Other Deduction-Interest Capitalized)
to hyperion 1690 (Other Income -Other)               Effective: for SEPTEMBER 2001 Close.

     SAP Accounts      Description                             From: Current Mapping              To: New Mapping
          59900900     AFUDC Equity Settlement                1755_59900900                     1690_59900900
          69010000     AFUDC Equity                                 1755_69010000                     1690_69010000


 




AFUDC equity (SAP accounts 59900900-AFUDC equity settlement and 69010000-AFUDC equity) map to Hyperion 1755-interest capitalized.  The only companies using these two SAP accounts as of July and the YTD credit balances in each of them are companies 141-$531,155, 179-$328,270, 413-$12,681 (debit), 536-$3,066,408, 60-$91,391 and 62-$290,438.

In conclusion I have reviewed the proposed remapping with representatives of the various ETS companies and they confirmed the remapping would not present any problems to them.

PS.   Pls notify me or Hoyt Ivey when change is made in Corp Hyperion so he can remap same accounts in EOC hyperion.
