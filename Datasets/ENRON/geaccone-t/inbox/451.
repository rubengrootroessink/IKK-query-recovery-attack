If your mobile number is now corporately billed and your Corporate account is already set up for the I Buy It system, then I just need your mobile number and permission to transfer the final balance for your personal account over to your new Corporate account.  Thank you.

I want the payment from the final bill to go to the Corp account as 
well.  I do not need the bill to go to my home address.  I would like it 
paid through I Buy It. 

Thanks
