Hi:

I heard back that many of you have been unable to open the original
solicitation letter I sent to you because of the links involved with the
mail merge.  So, I removed the links and am resending it to you in hopes
that it works this time.  I have gotten requests from many of you to resend
letters via fax, etc. to various businesses.  I am more than happy to do
that for you.  Unless you tell me otherwise, in the interest of time, I am
signing your names to those letters and faxing them.  However, if you want
to use the attached letter on your own, feel free.

Thanks,
Peggy Haney
