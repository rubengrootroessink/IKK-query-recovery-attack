We are turning into Corp today, (3CE), (34.9).  This is a variance of (8.3) to what you have below.

NEPCO = (8.5) - due to project profit adjustments on LS Power/Kendall, IL, Cogentrix/Jenks, OK, and E.Coast Power/Linden, NJ.
EEOS =      .2 - Puerto Rico 2.0, Bonus accrual (1.0), and misc. other (.8).

FYI,  We are currently looking at the NEPCO projects to see if they require further writedowns.

Are we reporting the 4Q through EGS and not Wholesale?  Please let me know.

Erin
