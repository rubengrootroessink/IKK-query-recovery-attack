 New! Build and Save Customized Streamer

Dear Tracy Geaccone,

  <http://a676.g.akamaitech.net/f/676/773/60m/images.m0.net/catcontent/datek/nov1901-streamer/odot.gif>	
  <http://a676.g.akamaitech.net/f/676/773/60m/images.m0.net/catcontent/datek/nov1901-streamer/odot.gif>	Now Streamer
 real-time quotes can be as individual as you are - each and every time you log on to trade.

Our new Quick Launch feature <http://datek2.m0.net/m/s.asp?HB4845574550X1153469X83727X> lets you load, arrange and save your favorite Streamer
 screens onto your desktop. Customize these screens to fit your trading preferences. Save what you like and you'll save valuable time by returning to your favorite screen every time you open Streamer
.

Also new at Streamer
: our Actives applet <http://datek2.m0.net/m/s.asp?HB4845574550X1153470X83727X> that lists the 10 most active stocks within parameters you choose. Choose your criteria, time interval and market - The Island ECN
 or activity among Datek customers - and Streamer
 Actives does the rest!

You can also save screen space with smaller font sizes and resizable applets, or use Streamer
 hotkeys - back by popular demand.

As always, if you have any questions regarding your account, please contact Datek Customer Support at support@datek.com <mailto:support@datek.com> or call us at 1-877-94-DATEK (1-877-943-2835) from 8 AM to midnight ET on weekdays, and from 9 AM to 7 PM ET on weekends.
