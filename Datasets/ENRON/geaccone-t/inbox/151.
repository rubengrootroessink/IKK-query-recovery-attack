We need to discuss the timing and requirements here before I send this to anyone else.

Thanks

Subject:	2002 PLAN TEMPLATE

Attached is the template to be used for the 2002 Strategic and Operating Plan.  It includes the Income Statement, Indirect Cash Flow Statement, and numerous supplemental schedules.  

As discussed previously, this template requires more detail compared to what has been required in past years.  Some of the detail sheets are linked to certain lines on the summary sheets, so if you encounter an error message regarding a cell being locked, it will be because there is a more detailed sheet for input for that particular item.  Some sheets include check figures, so please make sure these are all reconciled before submitting the file.

A few reminders:
1. Please do not add any lines or alter in any way the 'Format' or 'PRMA' worksheets.
2. Please round all amounts to one decimal place, even within the cell (for example, don't have a cell show 45.2 and have 45.24395135 as the actual number in the cell).
3. Please do not include any embedded links in the file you submit.

With regard to Operating Expenses, there is an SAP Cost Element Mapping worksheet included to assist you in determining where expenses are mapped.

Also, please note that the due date for this file is THURSDAY, OCTOBER 4.

If you have any questions, please contact me (income) or Greg Adams (cash flow).

Thanks,
Steve
