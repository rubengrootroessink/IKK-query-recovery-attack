Recently, Enron Corp received a request from the U.S. Environmental Protect=
ion Agency (EPA) to provide information relating to any spill, discharge, o=
r release of "oil" (broadly defined but excludes natural gas or liquid petr=
oleum gas) from any EOTT pipeline facility for the time period from July 1,=
 1998 to July 7, 2001. A "pipeline facility" includes those fleet operation=
s where tanks are connected by/to pipelines or to other tanks through pipin=
g and in which any EOTT entity owns an interest. The EPA request seeks deta=
iled information concerning releases of "oil" during this period, including=
 among other things, the extent and nature of the spill, which EOTT or EPSC=
 representative/employee was the first to learn of the spill, remedial effo=
rts, weather conditions at the release site, etc. The request also seeks in=
formation concerning pipeline management system(s) in place during this thr=
ee-year period and efforts or investments made by EOTT to prevent the relea=
se of "oil," including capital costs, expenditures and maintenance costs.=

een contacted/visited by one of our teams by August 17, 2001, please contac=
