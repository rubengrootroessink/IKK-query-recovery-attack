Tracy, it looks like it is because of the estimate we used for the July cash
flow. I will keep looking at this and see if I can come up with a specific
item that caused this.

Sorry Tracy, I can't come up with the reason behind the July change of $11 
million in "Other, Net". Carolyn who completes the schedules had surgery 
yesterday so will be out until Sept. 11. I can't find the source of the 
amount that is hardcoded in the spreadsheet - she must have combined 
something. One thought was TOLI, but it was flat in July. I have two other 
people who might be able to help me on vacation this week as well.

There was a big change in the Funds Flow number you submitted for the 3Q in 
August from the 3Q you submitted last month. Can you tell me what the change 
is due to? 

Thanks 

Tracy
