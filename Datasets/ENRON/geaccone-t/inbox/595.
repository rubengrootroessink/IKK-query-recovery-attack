Yes I told Steve.  Your stretch number keeps growing.
You may need to take an evening job to cover all the stretch he has assigned you.

I will be attending a TW imbalance meeting on Thursday morning faciliated by Market 
Services.  Dan Fancler has also been invited along with Kim Watson, Michelle Lokay
& T.K.

Have a good evening!

Jan
