Please take a look and get back to me by the first thing next week.    Please copy Tracy on your response to this....    Let's be honest so that Stan and Rick can get the right feel about the issues remaining relative to the years earnings.

Subject:	MESSAGE FROM MARK LINDSEY - 4TH Q 2001

As discussed in Rick Causey's staff meeting yesterday, please begin to review 4th quarter earnings for your business unit(s) and compile a list of any major hurdles, challenges, etc. (i.e. bonus accrual, "clean-up" items).

Furthermore, please assess any additional items that would be candidates for clean up, given the opportunity to expedite their resolution.

Meetings will be set up within the next week to discuss these items with you.

Thank you,
Mark Lindsey
