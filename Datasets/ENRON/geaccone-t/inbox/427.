Fair Value is applied to plant and is being amortized over a useful life. 
TW Fair Value is very similar to Goodwill in that it represents an excess over book value, and is not formally being recoverd in rates; BUT at the time of the  acquistion it was treated as a purchase price allocation an applied to plant. Goodwill is meant to be a "leftover" after all costs have been allocated.

Banks want to exclude goodwill. How would you explain the difference between the two?
