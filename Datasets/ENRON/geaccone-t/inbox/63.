Hello Tornado Parents,

Attached, is the Game schedule for our U-7 Tornados team.  As you an 
see most of our games are on Friday pm and I think three of them are 
on Sat mornings.

For the games, try to mark your calenders so you arrive at least 15 
min. before the start of the game.

The kids have been great and we are really going to have some fun. 
Thanks for signing them up for soccer.  I'm really looking forward to 
a good season.
