Tracy,
There is a lot of confusion as to how 2002 Plan and Actual will be linked and how the related variance reporting will be made available.
I was glad to hear you would be having a separate meeting to discuss this issue.  Would you please make sure that both Cheryl Perchal and Barry Wiederholt are included in this discussion?

Thanks!
