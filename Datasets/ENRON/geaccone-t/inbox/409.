Hello Tracy,

I wanted to share some conversations that I've had with both Demetrics and
Hoang this week related to the project.

On of the biggest issue seems to be with resources.  I know that you guys
have been quite busy with your planning process but it has been very
difficult to get the required information or time from the resources that
are committed to the project.  This is due to the fact that they currently
have a heavy workload and cannot dedicate the time necessary for the
project.  It is having an impact on the timeline.  The home office model
could be a lot further along if some of the required information was
delivered as requested.  Also, I am also getting a sense that there is a
lack of ownership with regards to the Adaytum application.  It is important
that the users have a comfort level with the application otherwise it will
become very difficult to transition it when the project is over.

We need to think about who will administer the system once it is in full
production.  This individual should be identified and running the
administration duties as soon as possible.  My fear is that without proper
ownership of the application and a dedicated administrator (at least in the
short run), it will be very difficult to transition the roles.

We've had some technical issues with the production and development
environment.  Although these issues have been resolved, it has had an impact
on the timeline.

There are times that the definition for the model is not clearly articulated
and it has resulted in the redesign of the model.  Much time has been spent
on gathering business process information from various people which has
caused a delay in the model development.

I hope that we can constructively talk through these issues tomorrow and
produce solutions that will rectify the situation, mitigate the risks, and
result in a successful implementation.


Our call is scheduled for 1:30 tomorrow but I can be available earlier if
you would like to discuss this.
