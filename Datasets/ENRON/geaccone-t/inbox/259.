to my knowledge...we kept the "status quo" for sept (third qt)...that is, it "grew" by another $100,000.

from an acctg perspective we do have some flexibility to set the reserve at a level deemed appropriate

I just wanted to close the loop on the question of deferring the $.7million UCU credit to 2002.  The last we talked, it was decided that we could not defer the credit because of cash target concerns.  If this is still the directive, we will see a positive variance to Third Current Estimate in October of $1.2 million.  

Would you confirm that this is still our decision?  If so, we will include the earnings upside  in our Quarter Forecast next week.

Thanks
