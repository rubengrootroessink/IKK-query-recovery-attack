This is a preliminary working session  where we (ETS only) will be developing specs that we can provide to Sunrise, communicating our detailed business requirements.  The specs will be given to Sunrise and they will have to let us know if they can do the work and how much it will cost ETS.  Greg Lewis has arranged for a facilitator to help keep us on course during the day.

We have asked you to attend as representative for the Consolidations group.  While we might finish before the end of the day, we believe it is important that most participants reserve the full day in the event we need that much time.  If Tracy or James can attend all or some of the session that would be excellent.

The meeting with Sunrise is scheduled for Friday, November 30, at 11:00 a.m. and Tracy is on the attendee list for that meeting.

If I can answer any more questions, please let me know.
