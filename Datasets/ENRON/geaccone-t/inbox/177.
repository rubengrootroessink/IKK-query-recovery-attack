Tracy, FYI, I already provided a list of Q4 challenges/hurdles to Rod a couple
of days ago.  Let me know if you need a copy.

I only need bonus data. Don't worry about 4Q data today. Please send directly
to me. 

Thanks

Subject:URGENT REQUEST 

Hello everyone. Management has begun to look toward the 4th quarter and is
requesting certain information from each business unit. 

I need to know, by 10:30am Wednesday: 

a. Total bonus accrual for 2001 
b. Amount of bonus accrual that is (or will be) accrued YTD through September
2001 
c. Amount remaining to be accrued in 4th Qtr 2001 

Additionally, each CAO* has been asked to compile a list of potential
hurdles/challenges/clean-up items for the 4th Qtr. that will be discussed at
an offsite this week. You may want to touch base with them and make sure they
are aware of this and come prepared. I have sent a reminder message to them
today also. 

Thanks, 
Steve 


*with the exception of EGEP (Jim call me if you want to discuss) 


PS - Faith and Tracy - I'm assuming you guys will coordinate for wholesale and
stan's world respectively. If you'd like me to contact any group directly, let
me know.
