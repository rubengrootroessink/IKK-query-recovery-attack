In conjunction with your migration to the Outlook/Exchange email system,  your Lotus Notes mail file has been moved to a new server in order to free up disk space and help reduce the time it takes for backups.   The new server name is NAHOU-LNARC01P/Enron.
 
Please note: your mail file is in the \mail2 subdirectory on the server (not the \mail subdirectory)
 
Your Lotus Notes Location document will need to be modified to reflect the new server name.  Also, you will need to add the new file to your Lotus Notes Workspace by opening up your re-located mail file.
 
If you need assistance configuring these changes, please contact the resolution center at X-31411.
 
Thank You.
