You always say the most wonderful things!  I love being with you.  I think we were made for each other.  Everything seems to work really well between us. I have found everything I have ever wanted with you.  I can't wait for us to be together always.  I miss you already.

Love you,

Tracy

Hi. You are so wonderful. Can it get any better?!!! Every minute with you no matter what we are doing is perfect. I love you so much and can't wait for us to be together always. You have a great sense of humor and you understand mine (that's a plus!). Take care babe.
