The following volumes are capacities west of Station 1 that will result fro=
m tie-in construction work slated for the Red Rock expansion.  Tie-in assem=
blies will be required on both the Mainline and Loopline at stations 1, 2, =
and 3.  New block and side valve assemblies for new compressor and scrubber=
s will be installed on the suction side main and loop lines at each station=
.  The tie-in will entail blocking (isolating) a line segment within the st=
ation yard on the suction side (each line done separately) thus creating a =
dead leg back to the next upstream block valve crossover(s).  Hence, all of=
 the flow will be forced into a single line when making tie-in on the adjac=
ent pipeline line.  The result of forcing all volumes into a single line wi=
ll produce greater pressure losses in the operating segment to the existing=
 compression and reduce throughput due to lower suction pressure and respec=
tive horsepower limitations.  Discharge piping at the station having tie-in=
 work will be unchanged regarding valving configurations.
