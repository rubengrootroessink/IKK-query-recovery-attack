Griffith Update :

The steam turbine is 95% re-assembled and should go into a 24 hour oil
flush this afternoon.
This will follow with 24 hours on turning gear.
We anticipate lighting off CTG #2 on Saturday morning, followed by CTG #1
mid morning Saturday.
Gas and electric noms are out - if anyone foresees any problems
accomplishing our goals, especially over the weekend, please advise.
