I did not send one first thing this morning, however I did give the map to Michelle in the morning.  I told her I did not
fax one down this morning.  Sorry Steve didn't get his copy seems I can't win either way.  He will get one from someone.

Darrell, we did not receive the gas day map this morning via fax.

Would you please make the necessary arrangements to have this document faxed to Steve every morning.  It is essential that we receive this on a regular basis.

Thanks in advance for your assistance,
