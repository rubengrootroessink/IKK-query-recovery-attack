1.  On your first request for down time next week.  You may have an opportunity this weekend 23, or 24 depending on the volumes.
We can communicate this to your Team Friday afternoon.  We can not committ to next week at this time.
2.  Your best opportunity to pull your ESD is going to be on a weekend or weekday when or flows are down to the border.
We can check every day and let you know when this may be possible.  At this time we cannot committ to your outage requests.

Thanks DS 
We will stay in touch.
