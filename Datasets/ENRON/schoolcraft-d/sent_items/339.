Talked with PG&E today and they would like to flow rate today and we can talk to them each day.  Our imbalance is 
85,000 mmbtu they owe TW.  I will visit with Mike O'Donnell about our imbalance.  For now use the scada point
for daily flow rates and not the spread sheet.

It looks like we are over delivering 2000 to 3000 mmbtu/d at PG&E Topock everyday.  I will have the Field go out and 
take a look at the measurement.  We need to set the point approximately 5000 short every day until further
notice.  I will visit with PG&E and let them know what we are doing.
