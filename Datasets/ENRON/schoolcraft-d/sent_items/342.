Disregard the below message.  Sorry about that. I've got egg on my face.  TW did not over deliver to NNG.  The previous day accums for Estes did not role in scada until a little after 10:00 am.  I did call Dale to ask if that should take that long to role over.
We are just trying to keep a close eye on imbalances.
