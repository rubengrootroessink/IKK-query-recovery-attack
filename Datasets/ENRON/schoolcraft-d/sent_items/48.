Subject:	Griffith Gas & Electric Estimate - Monday Sept 17, HE 8:00 to Sept. 18, HE 7:00

Notes:
1) On Sunday the startup team changed their plans and did 2 ST Trip Tests
instead of tuning Duct Burners as planned.
2) Will do Duct Burner Tuning on Monday.  Expect MW swings.
3)  MW outputs are average values only in order to schedule overall gas
nomination for the 24 hour period.
4) Actual MW must be handled in real time.
