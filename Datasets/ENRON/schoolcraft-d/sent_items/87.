Darrell - Did you ever find out what we have on the Atoka points regarding sulfur monitor?

Lorraine after looking over what volumes we'll be receiving we'll be needing a total sulphur instrument at this location. I understand NGPL has one at the Indian Basin Plant which is an Old Barton Recorder type. These type of instruments will not pick up all the sulphur we're experiencing out of the field in that area. We have instruments that will pick up butyl sulphur along with many others that most other companies equipment can't read at this time. We're also experiencing large amounts of butyl which is a major problem for us in the Atoka field. By receiving this into our system we're having to batch or inject corrosion inhibitor's in our pipelines for protection. This is a cost to operations that we need to get a handle on. Thanks for your help in this matter

Perry I agree with Arnie and the team. In order to keep our pipelines in good shape we need to know what we are receiving, especially from these larger delivery points. It seems like every time we agree to something different than what we require operations has to go back to marketing for dollars or put in equipment to correct the situation. We're trying to cover all bases up front so this doesn't happen in the future.
Thanks
RJ

Perry,
The Artesia Team and I still have concerns about having no total sulfur monitor at the location.  We are already taking gas that has high total sulfur at Atoka 2.  Since we have started using sulfur instruments that pick up Butyl Sulfur, we are almost always over .75 grains at Atoka 2 into the West Texas lateral.  The instruments that NGPL uses at the Indian Basin plant may not see Butyl Sulfurs.  If this it the case, we may have the same problem that we have at Atoka 2.  If we don't have enough other inputs to blend the gas, this can become a quality problem for deliveries at other locations. 
Since this is a 50mmcfd input to our system, I sure think we need the protection.
Thanks,  Arnie

Laura & Earl:

Planning and Gas Control can accept control valve operation by NGPL, which is included in the current drawings.  The installation of 2 control would give us problems with them fighting each other.  We have an OBA with NGPL, and we will monitor their future compliance to volume requirements.   We might have to address in this in the future if the fail to comply, but for now we're okay.

NGPL has basically the same tariff as TW and they feel protected from total sulfur at the tailgate of the Indian Basin Plant.  The Delmar H2S at the NGPL/TW point  will protect us both from H2S.  We may want to grab a sample from the IB plant to baseline the current sulfur content and verify accuracy.  Darrell and myself are comfortable with the current plans, to not install total sulfur at our interconnect with NGPl.  The cost of this new instrument is around $40,000 and I don't believe either company has plans to replace,  NGPL total sulfur instrument.

Arnie and Terry, please review and let us know if Operations can comply with our findings.  I am sure this can be resolve to our mutual agreement.
