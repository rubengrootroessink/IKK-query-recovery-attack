Darrell,

Are these correct?  These will definitely affect the TW allocations AND Outages you post.

I have changed the point / group lookup when posting TW notices through the Informational Postings Administration Utility.  It now takes the group information from the CAS system instead of PLE.  Please take a look at it to make sure it looks right.

Go to http://172.30.200.203/ebbadmin/notices/default.htm and log on as "ebbadmin","august2000".  Go to enter a new TW allocation and press the "POI/Lateral" button from the notice detail window.  The point information is now taken from the new PLE system and the group information is now taken from the new CAS system.
