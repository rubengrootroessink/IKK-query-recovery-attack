Beginning today June 14, 2001

We need to operate the Interconnect points between Transwestern and Northern
just like we do all others.  We have orders everyday and we need to balance
unless both pipes have agreed to work on the imbalances.
When Transwestern or Northern get into operational constraints we need
to work with all the Interconnect customers.  If customers are not in the position
to help and we have to go out of balance on Transwestern or Northern for operational
constraints, please leave myself, Gary or Steve and E:mail or telephone message
of all volumes, and why's.  We will need to be able to address them in the morning
meeting.

If you have any questions please feel free to ask.
