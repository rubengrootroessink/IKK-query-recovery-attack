The pig runs on the Panhandle Lateral this week were a success.  Liquids received are as follows:
P-1 - 500 bbls
P-2 - 500 bbls
P-3 - 350 bbls
We really appreciate everyone's efforts to make this happen as smoothly as possible.  It's a lot of work from the teams and a lot of trouble for gas control to get the gas flows needed, but still necessary to do.
I suggest we look at pigging the lateral again during the week of Sept. 10th.  This time we will need to run a pig from Sta. 9 to the Pecos River on Monday and then sweep the river crossing.  The run from the river to P-1 would be Tuesday, P-1 to P-2 on Wednesday and P-2 to P-3 on Thursday.  Let me know if you have other thoughts on this.
Thanks,  Arnie

Darrell,
Per our phone conversation this morning, I'm requesting gas to run pigs on the Panhandle Lateral next week.
Preferred Schedule:
  Tuesday - 8-14-01 - River to P-1
  Wednesday - 8-15-01 - P-1 to P-2
  Thursday - 8-16-01 - P-2 to P-3
I spoke with Tony Teakell and he said they can run the pig from P-2 to P-3, even with short notice.
If you and/or Gary can't get the flows at these times, contact us as soon as you know, so we can work around it.
Thanks,  Arnie
