We have been under burning at the Great Lakes - Carlton Interconnect for the past few days.   Gas Control was seeing what appeared to be a good flow rate but due to a calibration error between our Seimens Controller at Carlton and the Great Lakes computer we have actually been under burning.    The Control Tech - Roger Salmi - is performing a calibration now and we should be sync'd up with Great Lakes this afternoon.

I have passed this to Gas Control and they will make the necessary adjustments to correct the imbalance once Roger has completed the calibration.
