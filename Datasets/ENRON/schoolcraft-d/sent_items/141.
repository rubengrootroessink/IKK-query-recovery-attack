I talked to Jim about this today. He is going to contact the transformer people (Virginia) to see what they recommend. Jim is thinking they should stand behind this repair since it is a manufacturing problem. Since we are in tariff and no urgent problem exists at this time, maybe gas control will give us 8 hours in September to make the repairs.
Sorry it took so long to respond but this one got lost in my e-mail.
Thanks for your help Jim. We will talk again in week or so.

Thanks, Korey
