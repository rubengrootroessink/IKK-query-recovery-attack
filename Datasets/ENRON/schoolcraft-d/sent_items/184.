Darryl can you use this as your senario cards...    What I think we should do is as follows:  I will give you a call at 11:30 CST insuring that you are at the gas control board.  I will call you on your cell phone (713-826-4223) and stay in contact with you for the first 10 minutes or so.  When all the players are in place (Mangement, Local Emergency Planning Committee representative, you, etc....) I will initiate the drill by verbally telling you to start.  

At that point you will hand the controller on the board a note stating: 
1)  This is a mock situation, do you understand that this is a mock situation?  
2)  Tell the controller that with all communication they make from this point forward they will need to make it clear to start each message or phone call with "This is a mock emergency do you understand." 
3)  Pass out the first Step information on a piece of paper at the given time....
4)  Pass out the second Step information on a piece of paper at the given time....
5) and so on......


Step 1 -  11:30 CST 
Loss of pressure (and flow, if flowing) at the Citizens Kingman TBS.

Step 2 - 11:32 CST
Loss of pressure and flow to the Griffith power plant and North Star Steel.  (As Darryl and Tiny will be in continuous cell phone contact, Roger will now know that as Step two is handed to the controller he will need to initiate the call to the OCC simulating a call from a contractor that has hit our line.)  

Step 3 -  11:38  CST
Discharge pressure increasing quickly at Station 1.  Supply pressure slowly dropping at Needles and Calpine.  
(Trying to simulate mainline valve line break activation.  At least one of them.)

Assumption is that the OCC would notify Gas Control and Team????  (wait to see what happens from there)  Darryl make whatever modifications you feel would enhance this drill.  I know you are more familiar with what your folks should expect to see.  The main thing we are trying to simulate is a rupture on the Kingman TBS lateral which will activate a line break between the Kingman TBS and Station 1.  No line break down stream of the Kingman TBS will activate...  Therfore we will see the pressure dropping at Northstar, Griffith and eventually at Needles and on the Topack Lateral (Calpine, Mohave, and PG&E...)  Let me know your thoughts..   

Darryl and Tiny will remain in contact for a few more minutes and Roger will be on location with Tiny so we should have a closed loop on communications.  Arnie Bailey will monitor the conf. bridge from Roswell.  

Any questions give me a call as I will be in meetings for the next two days so drop me an e:mail or get me on my cell....  thanks....
