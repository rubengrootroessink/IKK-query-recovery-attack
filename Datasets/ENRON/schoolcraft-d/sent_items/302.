Lindy,
You are correct they are physical plant receipt points.
The Pecos Diamond plant is the straddle plant located on the Atoka Lateral.

Thanks DS

I don't think any of these are straddle plants.  (The plant we discussed previously, I think, was the Peco Diamond which is a straddle plant.)

Linda, am I correct on these 3 below?

Sorry it took me so long to respond.  Maybe you already have answers to this.

I'm afraid I asked you this question before, but I can't find where I wrote down your answer. Sorry.

Anyway, are any of these plants straddle plants, or are they "real" physical receipt points. These are the plants we're receiving gas from in May.
