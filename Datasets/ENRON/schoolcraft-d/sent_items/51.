Subject:	Pigging of SJ - Bloomfield to Gallup

As the efficiencies of the lateral (between Bloomfield and Gallup) steadily decrease it is time to probably think about pigging that section again in time for the upcoming tariff season. We will be scheduling a meeting next week to talk about the following:
1)	When should we do this?
            Ben can your group figure what volume loses we are incurring as the percentage of efficiency goes down? After that we need to get marketing involved and 
            let them tell us when to pig the line and add new inhibitor. 
2)	Should we also consider surfactant cleaning?
            This will have to be looked at but only after running pigs to see what condition the pipeline is in. 
3)	It has been almost 6 months since the application of the DRA on that section. Should we re-apply?
            Again this is dependent on revenue loss compared to percentage loss and marketing will have to be involved.
4)	What are the costs-outages, cost of app
            This is dependent on what all we will be doing. If we add surfactant the cost will be quite a bit more. How many times do we run the pigs to get the line ready 	(we don't know this.) We'll need to work with Darrell Schoolcraft and marketing on outages. Cost of application we can get this from Nalco.
  5)	What are the benefits.
            Getting back to 7% increase in efficiency. 

           I'll be in a meeting in Oklahoma next week but will be available for a call.

Thanks
RJ

Please let John Sturn or myself know of when you cannot make a meeting next week.
Thanks
