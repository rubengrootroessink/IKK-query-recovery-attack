What seems to be the problem with start up.  When you do will you be in more test phases or commercial.

Subject:	Griffith Gas & Electric Estimate - Friday Sept. 14, HE 8:00 to Saturday Sept 15, HE 7:00

This schedule is for performance testing as follows:

1) Cold Start Test
     Must bring the plant up to Base Load in less than 8 hours.
     Scheduled to start both CT's during HE 8:00

2) Steam Turbine Trip Test:
     Scheduled to occur in HE 17:00 then bring CT back up to base.

3) Operation at Minimum Load:
     Scheduled to occur  HE 21:00 to HE 22:00

Special Request to DETM and WAPA for today to permit Griffith to change
plant output without constraint as long as we strive to make the average MW
shown on this schedule for each hour.  (This has been approved by Cal
Ingram of WAPA)

Note: If something happens and BVZ cannot stay on this schedule, then DETM
can again call for limits on the timing of ramp up or down as required.
