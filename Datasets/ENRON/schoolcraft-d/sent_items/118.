Darrel attached is an e-mail sent out to the North Team approved by Gary concerning the Trailblazer outage.  Gary did not plan on posting the rescheduled Trailblazer outage for Nov. 8, since it will not affect throughput.

This is a correction to the Trailblazer outage, the outage has been rescheduled for Nov. 8 and is an outage on NNG side of the pipe.
Per Gary this outage has been worked out between both Trailblazer and our Gas Controls to not affect throughput.

The outage planned at Trailblazer Beatrice Point 1318 for Oct. 30 has been rescheduled for Nov. 6 by NGPL.  This is a 16 hours outage on NGPL side of the pipe and is not a NNG outage. This information was supplied by Gerry Graves of System Planning.
