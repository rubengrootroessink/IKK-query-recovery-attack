I failed to identify myself on the note below. I am the Operations Foreman
for St. Johns Operating # 1 L.. P.  We have a total of 7 wells in the
Higgins Tx. area shut in. Our daily loss of production is 1.9 MMCFD. This
loss is hurting our cash flow very badly. Your attention to this matter is
greatly appreciated.........

In early June 2001, GPM/Duke Energy informed me of the planned shut in for
maintenance on your processing plant in western Oklahoma. The planned
maintenance was supposed to be for the period of 6/12/01 thru 6/29/01. On
6/28/01 I received notice that the shut in would continue until 7/9/01 due
to "waiting on parts/material"
On 7/8/01 I received a notice that the shut in would continue until 7/13/01
due to "waiting on parts/material". On 7/10/01 I recieved a notice that the
shut in would continue until 7/18/01 due to "waiting on parts/material".
When I checked as to the status of the project early the morning of 7/18/01,
I found that the shut in would continue until 7/27/01 due to " waiting on
parts/material".

When is the parts/material ever going to arrive?

Was this a planned shut in?

This has turned out to be very, very, costly to your customers. Are their
any plans for any compensation to them?
