Ron from NNG Gas Control called around 7:00 pm.m informing me that ElPaso has a turbine down creating high pressure, NNG can't deliver the gas at Waha. I confirmed the gas to 0 for the next cycle (eve cycle) in ElPaso. but did not cut any for gas day 10/8/01. The gas for tomorrow is sourcing from Altura so please contact them in the A.M. and let them know the shipper was cut ot zero. Gas Control was able to deliver gas yesterday because the pressure wasn't as high as it is now. Evidently this outage started on the 7th and is scheduled to last through the 12th. NNG probably shouldn't allow nominations at Waha until the outage is completed. 
NGTS contract 107848 was the only Shipper nominated for tomorrows gas day. EPNG will try to get the pressure down to allow us to flow to them, but won't know that until later, or tomorrow. 
(Reliant has a nom on NNG side, but not in ElPaso' system)


Also, Darrell (the allocatin' dude) decided to allocate Linam Ranch (ID2 cycle) down to 100,000 because they were not making rate since last Friday. In cutting the Linam Ranch Point the Hobbs system Group was not allocated on the ID2 cycle. 

so far my first night back has been rather exicting!!
