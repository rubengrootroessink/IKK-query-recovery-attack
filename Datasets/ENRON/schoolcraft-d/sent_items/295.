Through the 21st TW owed you 36,000.  It looks like to me through the 24th TW owes you 42,000.   Amy and I agree on the numbers.
If you have any questions please call.  Since we are scheduled at max capacity we may not be able to give you gas for imbalance,
let's continue to talk on a daily basis and they can also work with gas control for this weekend.
