This was originally an Enron operated facility prior to selling of the gath=
ering assets, which then became a Duke operated  facility. This point was r=
e-activated in December,2000, without Measurement's knowledge, and apparent=
ly Market Services and others until April 2001. Had this been a new point, =
the current procedures for assigning station number, POI numbers, etc. woul=
d have probably prevented an incident such as this from occurring. Bottom l=
ine, in addition to generating PPAs and  distortion of the pipeline balance=
 report by improper accounting of all receipts and deliveries, this has rai=
sed several areas of concern such as safety, transportation of unscheduled =
volumes, and others. We would like to schedule a meeting sometime in June (=
time and place to be announced),  to address procedurally, what all departm=
ental requirements are for volumes to enter and exit our pipeline facilitie=
s. Please forward to contacts within you various organizations that you fee=
l are necessary and critical to examination of current procedures, and poss=
ibly adoption of new ones, and let me know and I will add them to the distr=
ibution.
Thanks-

I have gone back through all my own removal (First and Final) history and I=
 didn't remove that one.  My own history goes back to 9/98 so it was done b=
efore then. The reset will be easy enough when we find something out assumi=
ng we use the same number.  Someone REALLY dropped the ball here!   Sigrid

Karen Brostad called about this point,  Duke Schultz #1.  It was supposed t=
o have been reconnected Dec, Jan time frame.  I called Ronnie and he said h=
e remembers it but we had to assign a new number.  He didn't know what it i=
s seeing as he's here in Houston.  I tried calling Sammy Williams, he too i=
s in Houston.  I talked to Danny Garvin he only knew of one Duke connect an=
d the name did not match up.  I also paged Randy Fitzgerald, he has not ret=
urned my call.  Karen is having the same problem getting hold of anyone.  I=
 didn't see it on your first and finals either.  Anyway, if you know anythi=
ng about this call Karen in the AM and let her know.

Thanks,
verlene
