 Dear Heavenly Father,
 We are  moved by the alarming news and crisis that our country
 is facing.   This, the greatest nation, founded in the belief of "In
 God We Trust"  and the "Land of the Free".
 Please have mercy on  those
 suffering, hurting and in fear, and give wisdom & strength to  those who
 are
 assisting.  May the forces of evil be  broken by your power and may
we  humble before thee, our strength and  refuge.
 Give wisdom to all our President & our  leaders
 and bring your  comforting peace
 through the  power of your Holy Spirit.  Help us here to reach out
 to those  that have been affected by this tragedy.
  In the name of our Lord  and Savior, Christ Jesus.  AMEN

  Please send this to all your  friends and create a prayer chain
  throughout  this  nation.
