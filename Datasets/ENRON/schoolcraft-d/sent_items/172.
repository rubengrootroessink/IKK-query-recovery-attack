TW Red Rock Team: Just spoke with Byron Rance and his message should read a=
s follows for the Tie-In Schedule.  (Station 2 was listed twice; the second=
 listing for March tie-ins should be Station 3.)


After discussion with Arnold Eisenstein, the following are (very) tentative=
 dates for tie ins.
=20
Station 2, mainline, October 22, 2001, 4 days
Station 2, loop,  November 5. 2 days
=20
Station 1, mainline, March 4, 2002, 4 days
Station 1, loop, March 13, 2002, 2 days
=20
Station 3 , mainline, March 18, 2002, 4 days

Station 3 , loop, March 28, 2002, 2 days.

The following volumes are capacities west of Station 1 that will result fro=
m tie-in construction work slated for the Red Rock expansion.  Tie-in assem=
blies will be required on both the Mainline and Loopline at stations 1, 2, =
and 3.  New block and side valve assemblies for new compressor and scrubber=
s will be installed on the suction side main and loop lines at each station=
.  The tie-in will entail blocking (isolating) a line segment within the st=
ation yard on the suction side (each line done separately) thus creating a =
dead leg back to the next upstream block valve crossover(s).  Hence, all of=
 the flow will be forced into a single line when making tie-in on the adjac=
ent pipeline line.  The result of forcing all volumes into a single line wi=
ll produce greater pressure losses in the operating segment to the existing=
 compression and reduce throughput due to lower suction pressure and respec=
tive horsepower limitations.  Discharge piping at the station having tie-in=
 work will be unchanged regarding valving configurations.
