When operational capacity changes during any cycle the below comments will need to inserted into the point
or group comment section in CAS. 
1.  Socal Window
2.  Low line pack inventory
3.  I/C or plant non performance
4.  High line pack inventory
5.  Compression status
6.  Other
  
*During normal business hours except for Evening and ID-2, Myself, Gary, Steve, Terry, or John should be 
 responsible for loading comments into CAS unless the Reps. have been given the directive to update comments.
*Weekends, and Holidays, Reps. will be loading comments into CAS.
*When new points or groups show up to be allocated that have not previously been allocated, you will need
 to page me or in my absence Gary, Steve.  We will let you know what to do with the capacity either update
 or allocate.  
If you have any questions please call me or page.

Thanks DS

When doing allocation process and we allocate points or groups on the Timely, Evening, or Non-Grid. 
We allocate with the capacities that are loaded from CAS.  When allocating points or groups that have
not previously been allocated on any of the previous cycles during ID-1 or ID-2 we need to use the flow rate calculation.
.
Example :  Allocations are as follows

The only point to be exempt from this method should be Socal Needles because of their window issue
Timely:        M/L Thoreau West System                1093.000  (capacity)
                   I/B Link                                             700.000  (capacity)
                   Laplata/Ignacio                                  500.000  (capacity)
                   Socal Needles                                   775.000  (Window)
Evening:      Same sequence 
Non-Grid:     Same sequence

ID-1or ID-2:  Same sequence shows up to be allocated.  
                   Since they were previously allocated on the earlier cycles we do not need to right mouse 
                   click and calculate flow and update capacity based on flow rate.  The only time we should 
                   have to calculate flow rate is when there is a new point or group shows up that has not been previously
                   allocated.                   
             
 The reason for the change is we have recieved more FERC data requests on capacities and scheduled volumes.
lets try this for a while and see how it is working.
