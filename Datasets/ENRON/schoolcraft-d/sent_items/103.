The pigs arrived at Gallup about 1:00 pm, and were pulled  out of the trap for inspection. We found very little
liquid and about a gallon of yellow chalk looking powder. The pigs showed to be worn some, and that may indicate
 there was not liquid in the line.  We blew the scrubber before and after the pigs arrived and found no liquid in it. We will
go ahead and run another set of pigs om Monday 10/15/01 and we let everyone know the results then. We are going to send the samples we pulled into the Lab. next week, if you have any questions please give use a call..........Gallup Team..Pat
