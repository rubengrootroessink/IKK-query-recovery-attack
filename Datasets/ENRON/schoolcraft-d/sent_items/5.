I don't know that for a fact.  I assumed since they do the same thing for the lamar power plant they should know to do the same
for Griffith and Calpine, that is why we send those daily schedules.

They had a 35,000 order and Kieth put the setpoint in at the mainline.  They sent a schedule for what they intended to pull hourly and
he didn't look at it.  I got with him yesterday and explained how the spread sheet works they send us and how to figure the hourly takes 
for a 24 hr period.  Guess I should'nt assume they know to do that.  I will take the to do to get with each gas controller again and explain
how Griffith works both at the power plant controls and the mainline.

We need to keep our communications open to the plant.  I know that during their test mode they have had a variance in load projections.
Hopefully when they become operational their loads will be more steady.  
Ken,
Sorry about yesterday.  Thanks to your quick responce to our gas control so we could correct the problem before the plant
went down.  
If you have any more questions please call. 

Thanks DS  713-853-4299
