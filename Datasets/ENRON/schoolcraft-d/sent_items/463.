The Bisti Motor failed Thursday evening and resulted in a station ESD.  Initially, it was thought that the ESD was the result of a faulure in one of the fire detectors.  Once the alarms were cleared by the Operators and the station was totally reset, an attempt at a restart was made.  A variety of alarms (primarily related to the Motor RTD's) started flagging.  The Operators continued through a trouble shooting process that lasted until late this afternoon at which point it was determined that the motor had failed.  

Industrial Repair Service (IRS) out of Farmington Nm. was contacted and a rep. (Doug Harrison shop foreman) is due on site this evening (Friday) to further evaluate and provide timelines/schedules for removal.  Todd Ingalls has been in discussions with IRS's Paul Heikkinen (505-860-2398) in an effort to coordinate this removal process.   At this point, Operations is proceeding with a turnkey scope of work request from IRS for removal, repair and re-installation.  Moving as quickly as possible to turnaround this motor, field estimates tonight are in the range of 4 to 6 weeks.  We are looking at a "stator" failure this time versus the historic "rotor" failures that have occured at this facility.  

A couple of issues need to be discussed so I have set up a conf. call for 1:00 pm CST Monday.  (877-795-3687  pin 151120)  Updates should be available by this time.  (In the mean while, we are moving forward, pending IRS's availability, with the removal of the equipment)
