To: ALL EMPLOYEES

Due to the increased workload, the management has
decided that the company can no longer afford for you
to take time out of your schedule to go to the
restroom. Instead, to increase employee efficiency,
the company will shoulder the expense of remodeling
your cubicle to accommodate restroom privileges.

See your new cubicle layout (jpg attached)

Thank you for your cooperation
