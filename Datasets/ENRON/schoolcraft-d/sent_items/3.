We need to keep our communications open to the plant.  I know that during their test mode they have had a variance in load projections.
Hopefully when they become operational their loads will be more steady.  
Ken,
Sorry about yesterday.  Thanks to your quick responce to our gas control so we could correct the problem before the plant
went down.  
If you have any more questions please call. 

Thanks DS  713-853-4299
