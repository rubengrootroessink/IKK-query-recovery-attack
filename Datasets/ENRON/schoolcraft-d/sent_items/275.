I would be glad to play.  However I am not a scratch golfer anymore.  My ha=
ndicap is at 15 now that I don't play as much.
If you still want me to play let me know.  Thanks for the invite. =20

I love to play, I'm just not very good.  I would suggest Darrell Schoolcraf=
t (in gas control for ETS).  He's a good guy and almost a scratch golfer.  =
His extension is 34299.
