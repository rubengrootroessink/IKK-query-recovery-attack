We need to watch this real close.  We are scheduled for a conference call with Griffith and Citizens and El Paso.
They want to discuss operational scenarios.  Jesse I will let you know when and where so you can listen and add
your view points from a gas control perspective.

Thanks DS

This schedule is for performance testing as follows:

1) Cold Start Test
     Must bring the plant up to Base Load in less than 8 hours.
     Scheduled to start both CT's during HE 8:00

2) Steam Turbine Trip Test:
     Scheduled to occur in HE 17:00 then bring CT back up to base.

3) Operation at Minimum Load:
     Scheduled to occur  HE 21:00 to HE 22:00

Special Request to DETM for today is to permit Griffith to change plant
output without constraint as long as we strive to make the average MW shown
on this schedule for each hour.

Note: If something happens and BVZ cannot stay on this schedule, then DETM
can again call for limits on the timing of ramp up or down as required.
