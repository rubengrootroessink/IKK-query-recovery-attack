After talking with Ken and our Gas Control it appears we had and operater error, a setpoint was put in at the TW mainline.  The problem
was corrected and the plant pressure came back.  We think with an open line of communications between the plant and gas control
we hope to minimize the mistakes.  If any other concerns please call.

Thanks DS  713-853-4299

Please advise why the gas supply to Griffith Energy was shut off on 3 Sep
01 and what measures we can take to insure this does not repeat.
