Station 1:
Unit 101 was completed on the 24th. 
Unit 103 had one bearing that was running a higher then normal temp. We decide to utilize the contractor to change the bearing. The bearing was removed Thursday evening. Due to the amount of aluminum in the bearing saddle the cleanup is taking longer than we had hoped for. I just talked with station 1, and they are in the process of installing the bearing now. If all goes well, the unit should be running in a couple of hours. 

  This should complete all the scheduled overhaul work that was planed for stations 1-4.
