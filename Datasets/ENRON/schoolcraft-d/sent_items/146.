We are moving the tap from the side of the pipe to the top of the pipe on an existing tap(Rockwell Place)  to lessen the likelihood of fluid entering the customers equipment.
Thank you,

Why are we doing a hot tap?  Is this a new I/C?   If so is it a receipt or delivery.  Seems like gas control doesn't know anything about it.

Thanks ds

On Monday, July 9th commencing at 0700 we will be doing a hot tap on the TW 24" panhandle lateral at the Rockwell Place meter near Canyon, Texas. This is merely a courtesy notice as the scope of work will not require any manipulation of line pressure or interruption of service. 

Thank you,
Eric Haiduk
