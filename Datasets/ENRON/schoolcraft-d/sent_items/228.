Cleaning pigs are being run in Section 7 & 8 as gas flows allow.  Cleaning pigs will be ran in Section 5 during the week of Aug. 20th.  

Gallup - please notify Gary Choquette before and after each cleaning run and caliper run in Sect. 5 so he can check efficiencies.

Teams, please let me know who on your teams will be available for these caliper runs so I can set up support help as needed.  I know that Gallup will need 2 support people the week of Aug. 27th.

During the week of Sept. 10th there will be a TD Williamson representative on site to determine if Sections 7 & 8 are clean enough to smart pig.  Teams Roswell, Mountainair and Laguna will need to run the cleaning pigs until acceptably clean.  The smart pig runs in Section 7 & 8 is scheduled for the week of Sept. 17th.  I will send another e-mail dealing with the smart pig.
