Hey everyone,

In Ken's absence this week, I will be filling in as coach. I will not tolerate any of the nonsense that you all use to give Ken - there is a new sheriff in town this week. No really, game times are (9:00 & 11:00 this week. Please be there if you can.

Rich:

I called ken (he is in Pennsylvania) to get contacts for some other people. Feel free to forward to anyone I missed.

Thx all,
MW
