Subject:	2002 TW Overhaul Plan

By the end of next week, I will have the planned 2002 overhaul schedule for TW.  I would like to meet with you so you are abreast of what we have planned particularly  on the mainline.  We have developed the plan assuming units on the mainline, currently in PHFFU, will be necessary to meet system capacity.  I will be on vacation the week of July 16th, returning the week of July 23rd.  I suggest an afternoon meeting on July 25th or anytime on July 26th.  Please advise as to which one of these dates works for you.  Please advise if anyone else should be included in the meeting.

Thanks, Gary M
