Subject:	Caliper Tool Run on Section 5

Team Gallup,
We will be running the TD Williams caliper tool in section 5 (both lines) during the week of August 27th.  This run is a free run from TD Williams to try to lock down the locations of the dents in both lines near station 4 that we were unable to locate during the dig outs.  Prior to running the tools, we need to do two pig runs in each line for cleaning.  Hopefulling it can be done during the week of the 20th.
I've spoken with Gary Choquette and he requests to be informed before and after each pig run so he can check efficiencies.  
Please let me know for sure that these pigs can be run during the stated time frames, and also if you will need support help.  I think you indicated that you would need 2 people during the week of the 27th.

Darrell,
No flow restrictions will be needed for these pig runs.  The pigs, including the caliper tool can run at any speed.  We will need at lease 120mmcfd flow through station 5 to keep the pigs moving.  Do you see a problem?
Also, during the week of August 20th, we will be running the TD Williams caliper tool in the mainlines in sections 7 and 8  (station 8 all the way to station 6).  Again we will need enough flow to keep the pigs running, preferably 200mmcfd or more.  Do you see any problem?

Thanks,  Arnie
