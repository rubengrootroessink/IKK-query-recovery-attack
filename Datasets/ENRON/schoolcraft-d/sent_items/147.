I received a call from Ben Tanner saying that 2 discrete points have been discovered to not be working at Griffith Power Plant (Citizens).

CITZ.1001	General Alarm 2" Rotary Meters
CITZ.1002	General Station Alarm

They are working to see what is going on and will let us know when they are working.

Also, George Marshall found out that the Accums for the 2" runs on both the TW and El Paso side do not appear to be resetting at gas day.  Calls have been place to Citizens to follow up on this.


Let me know if you have any questions,

Angela
