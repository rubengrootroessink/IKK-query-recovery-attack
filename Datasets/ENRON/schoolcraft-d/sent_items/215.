Subject:	Griffith Testing Prior to Plant Outage

We are now in the process of planning a total Griffith Plant Outage to fix
equipment deficiencies.
Most likely start of Outage is on Sunday Aug. 12.  (earliest Saturday)
Duration of Plant Outage is approximately 6 days.

We have been running very steady for the last couple of days.  However,
please be advised that prior to the outage, various operational tests are
being planned.  During this time, MW output will be variable and difficult
to schedule. May I request your indulgence as we work through this phase.

Tomorrow morning, the Startup Manager will produce a list of tests to be
run prior to the outage.
As the Test Plan is developed, I will keep everyone informed as much as
possible.
