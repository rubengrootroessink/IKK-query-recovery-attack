Hey guys, 

Is there anytime today that we can meet to be sure we are all on the same page concerning P-3 and Halley issues?  My main concern is P-3, and its ability to handle the volumes we may need (pre- and post-modifications).  It seems Station 9, and the lower MAOP due to class location between P-3 & P-2, could put us at risk in various cases.

I am on vacation all next week, so if we can't do it today, Eric can set up a meeting with the rest while I'm gone.  I really don't want to let this go any longer than is necessary.

Let me know about today.

Thanks,

-Morgan
