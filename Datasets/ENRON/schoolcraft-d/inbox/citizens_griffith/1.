Received a call from Tom Tucker approximately 1600 wanting to switch the fl=
ow from TW to El Paso for testing purposes.  Tom explained that it was warr=
anty work and the flow would only be switched for about 5-15 minutes. I agr=
eed to allow him to switch the flow.  He agreed when he was finished testin=
g that everything would be put back to the original set points and he would=
 call GC when finished with the test.  Tom called GC shortly after the flow=
 was put back to TW feed to Griffith.  He explained that it did not take lo=
ng and everything was finished to his satisfaction.  Shortly afterwards at =
approximately 1725, I noticed that the TW feed to Griffith was falling in r=
ate and El Paso went to 165 flow rate.  I resent the set point for TW flow =
to Griffith.  I called the Griffith plant and spoke to Dave (operator at th=
e plant), who was unaware that Tom was in the yard, to check on the plant p=
ressures and flow.  Dave had not seen any problems with pressures or flow. =
 I also called Tom's cell phone - reached him the second time.  He was stil=
l at the site and told me that he had by-passed our meter to Griffith.  He =
also told me that the reading from El Paso was false and apologized for not=
 calling to let me know that he was performing additional work.  I asked hi=
m to call once again before leaving the site. =20
