>A little something to put things in perspective...

>An article in National Geographic several years ago provided a penetrating
>picture of God's wings. After a forest fire in Yellowstone National Park,
>forest rangers began their trek up a mountain to assess the inferno's
>damage. One ranger found a bird literally petrified in ashes, perched
>statuesquely on the ground at the base of a tree.
>
>Somewhat sickened by the eerie sight, he knocked over the bird with a
>stick. When he gently struck it, three tiny chicks scurried from under
>their dead mother's wings.
>
>The loving mother, keenly aware of impending disaster, had carried her
>offspring to the base of the tree and had gathered them under her wings,
>instinctively knowing that the toxic smoke would rise. She could have
>flown to safety but had refused to abandon her babies. Then the blaze had
>arrived and the heat had scorched her small body, the mother had remained
>steadfast.
>
>Because she had been willing to die, those under the cover of her wings
>would live.
>
>"He will cover you with his feathers, and under his wings you will find
>refuge." (Psalm 91:4)
>
>Being loved this much should make a difference in your life. Remember the
>One who loves you, and then be different because of it.
>
>Please pass this on to others you care about and don't drive faster than
>your Guardian Angel can fly. My instructions were to send this to people
>that I wanted God to bless and I picked you. Please pass this on to people
>you want to be blessed
