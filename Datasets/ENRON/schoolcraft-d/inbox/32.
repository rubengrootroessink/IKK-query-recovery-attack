I have spent a significant amount of time reviewing the operations and SCAD=
A on the San Juan lateral over the last couple of weeks.  I've uncovered so=
me issues that could significantly reduce fuel consumption on this system. =
 Listed in order of priority are:

Resolve La Plata Unit #2 flame-out problem.  Currently this unit is running=
 in manual control to limit flame-outs.  This prevents the station from run=
ning with only one unit at low flow conditions.  According to the La Plata =
team, this will require the replacement of the fuel control valve and unit =
control software changes.  Running in the manual mode is costing an additio=
nal 550 MSCF/D in fuel plus the extra O&M costs associated with the fired h=
ours on unit #1.  The team is expecting the new fuel valve soon but anticip=
ates that they will not get the necessary downtime to install the valve unt=
il after the end of the tariff months.  Due to the potential emissions issu=
es associated with its current operating mode, we may have to expedite the =
modifications to this unit.
Auto calculate a suction pressure setpoint for La Plata.  There are three f=
low controlled interconnects on the suction side of La Plata.  Using the me=
ter run pressures and/or the flow control valve position, we can maximize t=
he suction pressure setpoint to achieve the interconnect flow rates.  The h=
igher suction pressure reduces the power required at La Plata with an avera=
ge expected fuel savings of 175 MSCF/D.
Auto calculate a suction pressure setpoint for the Bloomfield Low service s=
imilar to the La Plata modification recommended above.  Estimated fuel savi=
ngs of 80 MSCF/D.
Modify the controls at Gallup to enable a quick turndown for a power peak. =
 Currently when a power peak is predicted, the Gas Control operators manual=
ly transmit a lower discharge pressure setpoint.  It may take a long time f=
or the new setpoint to actually gain control of the unit.  The suggested mo=
dification would have the Peak Power alarm I calculate automatically retran=
smitted to the field and unit/station controls were modified to quickly ram=
p down the unit in a controlled manner (minimize recycle and prevent unit t=
rips) to minimum power.  Gas Control could then send an override signal tha=
t would allow the unit to operate at higher loads if required.  Likewise, i=
f my Peak Power alarm clears automatically, the unit would return back to i=
ts normal process setpoint conditions.  Note that if Gas Control overrides =
my alarm, the override needs to latch until my Peak Power alarm clears.  Th=
e suction and discharge setpoint rate ramp limiter logic should be modified=
 to make them more responsive when they are far from the process values.  B=
ob McChane, Todd Ingles, and myself can develop this logic.
Modify the La Plata station control for improved load sharing.  Recommend t=
he load share method be based on matching compressor flow range margins.  I=
 will work with Todd Ingalls to develop the logic and code.  This control m=
ethod will ensure both units are operating as close to their high efficienc=
y point as possible and minimize surge recycle.
Modify the station control process setpoints logic at La Plata (Bloomfield,=
 Bisti too?) to include rate ramp limiters.  Currently, when Gas Control tr=
ansmits a new setpoint, the station accepts the new value and quickly chang=
es operating conditions to try and reach the new setpoint.  However, these =
changes may be occurring too fast and may contribute to the flame-out probl=
ems.  Again, I will work w/ Todd to develop the controls to achieve this.

In addition, it appears that the Compressor Performance utility would be he=
lpful for the operating personnel in determining when one unit could handle=
 all the flows at La Plata.  I'll try and package a version that can be ins=
talled locally and send it to Todd  Ingalls.

Todd, I looked and I do not have a copy of the existing station control for=
 La Plata.  Could you please zip it up and send it to me?

Additionally, I finally got a copy of the drawings for the Griffith Interco=
nnect.  It appears our flow swings at this point can be reduced significant=
ly by changing the operation of the flow control valve to a downstream pres=
sure control valve with a maximum flow control override.  Todd, who is resp=
onsible for the programming of the RTU for this point?
