Subject: A prayer for you


I said a prayer for you just now..... When you receive this e-mail just 
recite the following prayer. That's all you have to do. There is nothing 
attached. This is the power of prayer at work. 
Just send this to 4 people (including me) and see what 
happens on the fourth day. Do not break this, please. There is no cost, but 
lots of rewards. Let's continue to pray for one another. 
May today there be peace within you. May you trust God that you are exactly 
where you are meant to be. May you not forget the infinite possibilities that 
are born of faith. May you use those gifts that you have received, and pass 
on the love that has been given to you. May 
you be content knowing that you are a child of God. Let His presence settle 
into your bones, and allow your soul the freedom to sing, dance, and to bask 
in the sun. He is there for each and every one of you.

1. Be ye fishers of men.. You catch them - He'll clean 
them.

anonymous.

3. Don't put a question mark where God put a period. 
~~~~~~~ 
4. Don't wait for 6 strong men to take you to church. 
~~~~~~~ 
5. Forbidden fruits create many jams. 
~~~~~~~ 
6. God doesn't call the qualified, He qualifies the called 
~~~~~~~ 
7. God grades on the cross, not the curve. 
~~~~~~~ 
8. God loves everyone, but probably prefers "fruits of the 
spirit"  over "religious nuts!" 
~~~~~~~ 
9. God promises a safe landing, not a calm passage. 
~~~~~~~ 
10. He, who angers you, controls you! 
~~~~~~~ 
11. If God is your Co-Pilot - swap seats! 
~~~~~~~ 
12. Most people want to serve God, but only in an 
advisory capacity. 
~~~~~~~ 
13. Prayer: Don't give God instructions - just report for duty! 
~~~~~~~ 
14. The task ahead of us is never as great as the Power 
behind us. 
~~~~~~~ 
15. The Will of God will never take you to where the 
Grace of God will not protect you. 
~~~~~~~ 
16. We don't change the message, the message changes us. 
~~~~~~~ 
17. You can tell how big a person is by what it takes 
to discourage him. 
 Jesus Test 
 This is an easy test, you score 100 or zero. It's your 
choice. If  you aren't ashamed to do this, please follow the directions. 
Jesus said, " if you are ashamed of me, I will be ashamed of you before my 
Father."  Not ashamed? Pass this on . . . only if you mean it. Yes, I do Love 
God. He is my source of existence and Savior. He keeps me functioning each 
and every day. Without Him, I will be nothing. Without Him, I am nothing but 
with Him I can do all things through Christ that strengthens me. Phil 4:13  
This is the simplest test . . . if you Love God, and are not ashamed of all 
the marvelous things he has done for you, send this to ten people and the 
person who sent it to you!  Hebrews 13: 15 Through Jesus, therefore, let us 
continually offer to God a sacrifice of praise - the fruit of lips that 
confess his name.
