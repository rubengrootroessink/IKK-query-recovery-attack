Damn you are hard to catch on the phone...  I know we can do the maint. in March but like this past year they sold the fuel through March and as a result we had to wait until April to start the maint.  That is what I am concerned with.  Have we made a committment on this fuel figuring a projected rate (based on your numbers below) of a 1071 which we could not reach with maint in March.

It really doesn't matter if we have sold firm or not March is still available for maintenance, as we would do it through april, may or june.
To answer your firm question.  Jan. 02 1091, Feb. 1071. Mar. 1071, Apr. 1057, May 1057.  This is what I see right now you know how 
things change.

Just checking... In the previous two years we had sold firm through March which prevented us from performing maint. in the month of March.  So, my question:  Have we sold firm through March yet or is that month still available for maint. if we push this schedule up?  If I'm not making any sense give me a call.

  Yes Ronnie, I would still like to do that for 2 reasons.

1.	It moves the overhaul on unit 401 into March, which is the same month we are doing the tie-ins at Station 1 and 3. And since there will be a flow restriction from those tie-ins we can coordinate the two outages together and save a little of the flow loss.
2.	Starting and finishing the overhauls earlier will keep us away from our summer comments, if there are problems or delays.    

       If  there are no objections, I will change the dates to the new schedule listed below.

Jerry, A while back you suggested moving the overhauls up at Station 4 to
March 1st, 2002. If its still works for you lets give it a try. The only
concerns at this time may be parts delivery time, but I think we will be
ok. The recommended outage dates are listed below. Let me know if this will
work for you. Thanks!

Ronnie........

401 start date 3-1-2002, Completion date 4-9-2001
402 start date 4-11-2002, Completion date 4-21-2001
403 start date 4-23-2001, Completion date 5-3-2001
