Attached is a copy of the preliminary report that  recommends that the inlet pressure to Citizens "Griffith Plant" Station be  limited to 740 psig.  Note that this is only a preliminary report that  Citizens is reviewing.  Some of our "reviewers" are on vacation, and have  held up the process of getting this report finalized.
 
Since  I was temporarily assigned to another position during the time that gas was  introduced to this line, I have asked my employee Martin Conboy to create a log  of events on how these stations had been operated.  I will send it to you  later today.  
 
Can  you have David Roensch review to see if anything is missing.  I feel that  it is a good idea to document the different operation modes with results prior  to agreeing on any further changes.

Robert,
 
I had to delete a couple figures to get the size  below 1 meg to email.
 
Call if you have questions.
