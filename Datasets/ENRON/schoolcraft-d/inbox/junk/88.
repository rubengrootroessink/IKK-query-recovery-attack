The Operator Qualification (OQ) Rule, 49 CFR 192.801 requires that all pipelines develop a qualification program to evaluate individual's ability to perform covered tasks.  Each gas controller must complete the qualification program no later than June 1, 2002.  Each task must be completed in the presence of a trained Verifier in order to be qualified for that covered task.  The successful completion of a task must be documented and sent to the Training Group.  An individual may ask to be verified on a task as many times as necessary to successfully complete the task and receive a "Qualified" status.

At the November gas control staff meeting each gas controller was given a copy of the Skills Qualification Manual (SQM) and the Training and Verification Guide (TV Guide) to review.  I will be receiving the official personalized SQM this week and verification can begin at any time after that.  Steve January will assign you to one of the verifiers listed below:

Jerry Graves
Dale Ratliff
Darrell Schoolcraft
Gary Spraggins 

Verification and qualification will take place on days and at the control board.  Your team members will be responsible for operating your position and answering the phone during this process.  It is very important to keep interruptions at minimum.  You can verify on all or any part of the SQM when you feel you are ready. 

We are required by law to document that you can perform the task in the SQM. Remember this is your job, you do this everyday, and you do it very well.  If you have any questions call me at 713-853-1534
