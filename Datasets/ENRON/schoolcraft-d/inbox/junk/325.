I've arranged for Debbie Midgley from VeriForce to provide the training on January 31 from 8AM until 5PM.  This class is for the personnel who will evaluate the skills of other personnel.  Maximum class size is 10.  Please let me know if I've missed Houston or Midland based personnel in the distribution list.




Dale,
Can you reserve a conference room on your floor for the day?  We've called 3 people and can't seem to connect with the person in charge!
Thanks
