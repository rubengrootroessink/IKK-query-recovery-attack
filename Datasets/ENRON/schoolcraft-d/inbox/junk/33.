POI 78161 Is not in TMS production, not in PLE, but it is coming accross in TMS Model Office as part of the San Juan 2 group.  Charlie and Wayne will you please look into this.  I was using K#21901 and under the San Juan Group 500543.

Thanks

Maggie

POI 78161 is not valid in both production and model office PLE and has been since 8/1/2001.  I'm not sure where you are seeing it valid but it is definitely not valid in PLE.

Linda,
Here are two other points to update. Darrell told me that the BRI Jackrabbit poi # 500620 is active on TW, but not on Burlington's side. They are not set up to take the gas. It should be made inactive. Also poi 78161 & 500168 are the same point. We sum to poi 500168. So # 78161 should also be made not valid for Transport. 
Thanks Ramona

POI 500631 is an active, valid point in the San Juan Basin.  It has not started flowing as of yet.  It will stay in the groups it has been set up in until we are told otherwise by facility planning.
