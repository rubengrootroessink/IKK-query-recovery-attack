Darrell,

I have two questons for you.  First of all, New Mexico Natural Gas is disputing the allocation and stating some operational reasons, and they would like to talk to you.  Also, Phillips is interested in our Park service, and would like some information.  I know where the rates are posted on the web site, but is there other information I should give them?  

Thanks,
Christine
