   Last week we had our annual Links meeting in Liberal to go over upcoming=
 outages this summer and coordinate them with Mobile & OXY (well testing) a=
nd Oneok ( field compression & Bushton Plant). The goal of the Links meetin=
g is to improve communications and coordinate outage so that we can have th=
e least amount of throughput loss for all. We also discuss any ideas that c=
an be improved on. One idea that Mobile brought up is they would like to ca=
ll into gas control in the morning around 6:30 to 7:00  and get an update o=
f any outages during the night in the Hugoton area that may have caused the=
m to be short on gas. They need this information so they can report in thei=
r marketing meeting so they can adjust noms. So if the central controller c=
ould start making notes of any outages in Hugoton during the night that aff=
ected flow and pass them on to the day crew they would have this informatio=
n to pass on and not have to look it up. This would be very helpful for Mob=
ile. They may not call every morning but we need to have the information wh=
en they do.

Thanks=20
