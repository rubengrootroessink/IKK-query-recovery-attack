As of Sunday, January 20, 2002 
Griffith Power plant located off of TW's mainline was declared operational for Commercial Usage to the Power Grid market.

Gas Control Issues:
Nominations:
Their could be nominations every day for flow from El Paso and TW depending on the price and transportation agreements
between Duke and PPL.
You will see a total nom for the TW side in your daily orders and the El Paso order will have to come from the TW logistics 
Team.

Flows:
We may have to batch the El Paso volumes depending on the nominations.  We will watch the noms this week to get a feel
of where and how much they may vary.  
As agents for Citizens under the EMAR umbrella, We will need to get with the El Paso controller and let them know that your
going to open their side to be Primary and start taking flow from them to accumulate the order.(If this looks like it is going to be
small volumes we may need to batch the gas and work with El Paso Controllers.)  
Currently at the Griffith Power Plant TW and El Paso screens the primary control set point is 1 (TW primary)  
When you need to flow from El Paso you will need to switch the service to 2 (El Paso primary), and flow the gas until accumed
and switch back to 1 (TW primary). 
If anyone has a question on this please call me and we can walk through it.  Again as EMAR we are to make the changes at the
Site from Gas Control.
The only time we should get the Citizens people involved with the I/C is if we have a problem with Primary switches or pressure
problems.  Please refer to the call out sheet on the Console for Citizens.

Please don't hesitate to call if you need help.

Thanks DS
