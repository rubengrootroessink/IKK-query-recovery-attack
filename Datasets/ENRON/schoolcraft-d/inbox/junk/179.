Tim, I know we have the budget crunch and meetings this week, but when you get time per our conversation yesterday, please provide the Project Tracking Number for the Citizens Griffith RTU modifications to the folks listed above.  As long as we have this number available before timesheets are due we should be alright.  

All, this number should be used to track all of your labor, traveling expenses and/or any material required for this project.

At this point the modifications continuing forward for a Friday morning installation.  Citizens has been advised of the schedule and Darryl Scoolcraft has been notified.  Scott and Russ, please make sure you contact the gas control desk just prior to implementing the changes so they can be standing by.  Citizens has notified El Paso of the planned changes and timeline so that they are prepared to make up any volumes should a problem occur.  Scott and/or Russ will provide gas control with the register number to access the variable pressure setpoint remotely.  Darryl has requested that we initially set the pressure control at no lower than 680 to 700#'s.     Let me know if anyone has questions.
