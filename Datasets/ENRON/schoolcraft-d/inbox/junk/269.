Darrell

I was speaking with Linda Ward and she mentioned that there is displacement on POI 8042 PEPL Hansford Cactus.
This point is not showing in Model Office because in PLE is a delivery point, but it is currently in production as a valid receipt because it is part of the Panhandle all receipt template in CBS.  Call us Monday morning if we should be including this point as displacement SP group Panhandle.

Thanks



Maggie
