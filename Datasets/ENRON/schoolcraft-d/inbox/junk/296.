San Juan/La Plata,  do you folks already have your required downtime (outage info) for 2002 turned in?  I know the date may well change since the Outage meeting with the customers up there will not occur until March 7th, in Houston but, your estimated required downtime per unit should be available.  Please provide the amount of downtime you need at each facility to myself, Jerry and Darryl asap..  Let me know if I can help or if you need claification.  Thanks
