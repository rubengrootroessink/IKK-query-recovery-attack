Trailblazer will have an outage starting Tuesday, Feb. 5th. for 4 to 8 days. They are only going to schedule firm on their side during this time which is 522,000 mmbtu/d. This is about 100,000 mmbtu/d less than their capacity.  Also their pressure will be running lower which will be around 625 #  maybe higher.
