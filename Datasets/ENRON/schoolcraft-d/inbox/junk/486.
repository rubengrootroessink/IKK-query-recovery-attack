I received  a high h2s alarm at the Westar Carson point and had Joe Martinez to check it out. The point is not flowing at this time, but he did say that we can ignore this alarm in the future because it is a default reading. He will talk to some people soon and get this removed. My understanding is that it used to be a split signal there that would measure the h2s at the kb and westar. But now it's just one signal monitor there that measures the kb and it's set up on 10 min increments. After it gives you an h2s reading on the kb, it automatically switches to westar and gives you a reading there.
