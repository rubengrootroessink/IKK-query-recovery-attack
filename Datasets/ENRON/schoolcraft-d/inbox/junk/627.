I contacted Jamie Scnorf this morning, she forgot to send the daily burn order via email yesterday. She tried to send it this morning but for some reason it was returned to her. Per Jamie there is no change to the 60,000 order,  evidently there is a problem with the internet as she has tried to send this out several times this morning and we still haven't received it. (We'll probably get them all at once)
