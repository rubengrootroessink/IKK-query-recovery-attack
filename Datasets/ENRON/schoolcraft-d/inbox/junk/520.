Darrell:

Would you PLEASE go into the CAS system and let me know what shippers have primary firm at these three points:

NWPL La Plata   POI #500533
WFS Ignacio      POI #500535
Amoco Florida    POI #500536

I will then look at each individual contract and determine where they are delivering the gas to determine our commodity 
impact.

Thanks!
