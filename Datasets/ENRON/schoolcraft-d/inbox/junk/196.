All,

Attached below is the updated list of displacement points and Bidirectioanl points. I have made the changes for the Displacement SP group and the Displacement IT Groups. The points to be added to the Displacement SP group are valid as receipt points only and not as delivery points on  Supply pools.

Linda,
Can you let me know when these updates are made to PLE model office & Production?
I have also saved this file to the P drive under CMS projects.

Thanks Ramona
