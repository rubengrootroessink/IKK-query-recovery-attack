In visiting with the Canadian Team, they have informed me that we still have not ran a pig on the TW 24" Panhandle Lateral. It has been years since this pig has been run and we are sitting with a lot of high PH liquid in the line that is acidic. The last time a pig was run from Canadian River STation into P-3, they received approxamitly 1200 bbls and the station was flooded.

Due to the increase in pipeline safety and awareness, it is imperative that we set something up to run a pig on this line. We should run a pig quarterly or at least twice a year to maintain our pipeline integrity. Please let me know what you can get done on setting this up.

Thanks, 
Mickey
