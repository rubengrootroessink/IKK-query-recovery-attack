On-call reps for the upcoming weekend. Please read the message below and test your system out prior to the weekend. This will ensure all On-call reps that they have access to the WEB site and can access all applications required to work the weekend with minimal interruptions. If you have questions please ask someone prior to the weekend to assist you. Thank you.

Corporate IT will be performing maintenance this weekend which may interrupt our connection to the R: drive which houses the INTERNAL ETS TMS  from the INTERNAL desktops ONLY.   If the maintenance does cause a problem with the R: script, weekend reps. will have to access TMS via the HotTap web (www.hottap.enron.com).    Please have weekend reps. call the HotTap Help Desk to ensure they know their ID and passwords to access HotTap via the web.

Thanks,
HotTap Help Desk
Kim Perez

P.S.   This should not affect HotTap RAS access which is different from HotTap.
