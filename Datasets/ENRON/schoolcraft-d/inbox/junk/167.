Darrell,

Who are we physically receiving gas from at POI 59927, the GPM Zia Plant.  Is it GPM or Conoco?   I found a letter from GPM requesting Conoco to be their agent at this point so I need to know if this is GPM's point and Conoco is only the agent or is Conoco actually the physical operator.  Please let me know as soon as possible.

Thanks

Linda
