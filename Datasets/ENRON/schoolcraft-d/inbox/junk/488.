Ben, I understand the team collected pressure data at the mainline valves on the SJ lateral and forwarded to you all Tuesday.  Have you had the opportunity to calculate the current eff. following the dry pig run made last week?

Gallup, please provide digital pictures if possible and of course quantities of liquids and/or solids received.

Ben, I assume you be able to provide the post pigging effeciency on the lateral so we can continue to evaluate the timing of the DRA application?
