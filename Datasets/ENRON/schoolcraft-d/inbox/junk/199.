Hello everyone, I am putting together a few things for the meeting on March 7. I need to get a head count on who will be attending the meeting, joining us for dinner and also who will be joining us for the golf outing. If you need hotel suggestions please let me know. We will have the golf outing on the 6th followed by dinner. The outage meeting will still be on the 7th.

Please let me know ASAP and I will be sending out additional information the end of this week or early next week.
Thank you

Jerry Graves
