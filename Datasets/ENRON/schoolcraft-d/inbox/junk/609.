   Thursday, February 21, 2002 Issue 47   EDITORIAL  Protestors, Profits an=
d Cows    Most of the Eyeforenergy team has returned from our recent, Energ=
y, Weather and Emissions Trading conferences in Amsterdam.  With over 250 p=
eople at the event (and that's not counting the protestors and media who sh=
owed up), these events were a true success and we'd like to thank all the s=
peakers, sponsors and delegates who came and made it what it was.   Our new=
sletter this week brings together a number of interesting issues.  Al Masse=
y's written an article on the new Bush plan unveiled as a Kyoto alternative=
.  We've also got a first day summary of some of the key issues emerging fr=
om the Amsterdam conference.  And we begin looking further into the world o=
f energy management and what's out there for both the buyers and sellers of=
 energy in terms of both key issues and concerns as well as solutions.   An=
d finally, to end on a light note (and after a week that saw our conference=
 attacked by people with blue wigs and water pistols, how can you end on an=
ything else?), we've got a joke that was forwarded to us about cows and Enr=
on.  It certainly made us chuckle...     Feudalism You have two cows. Your =
lord takes some of the milk.Fascism You have two cows. The government takes=
 both, hires you to take care of them and sells you the milk. Communism You=

cows are transferred via an intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretl=

INSIGHT   Bush Unveils Kyoto Alternative "GHG, Global Warming and the Battl=
e of Semantics"    Since he came out in opposition to the Kyoto Protocol la=
st March, President George Bush has drifted from most of the world communit=

 Kyoto supporters came last week when the President unveiled his alternativ=
