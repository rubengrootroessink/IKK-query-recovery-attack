Following decisions were reached in the meeting today:

1) CMS will continue with it's implementation of Bloomfield Compressor point and points behind it in Division and associated points pattern.
2) CMS will continue to assign volume to each point behind the compressor as well as the compressor itself.
3) CMS will pass to TMS the Bloomfield Compressor point as well as the points behind it along with their assigned volumes.
4) CMS will pass to CAS information regarding the Bloomfield Compressor point only.  This fits the current business pattern (Dennis Lee and Perry Frazier will validated this in model office).
5) Since there is no change to mechanism that will feed information to CAS, Information Posting for TW capacities (Unsubscribed and Operationally available) should not be impacted.  Toby Kuehl will validate this in model office.
6) Since there is no change to mechanism that will feed information to CAS, EDI for TW capacities should not be impacted.  Mary Draemer, working with Steve Plant, will validate this in model office.
7) TMS will fix the view that displays capacities at points to make it like current production. (Wayne)
8) Ramona will start testing the TMS allocation process
9) Jose will assess the impact on any TMS reports
10) David Duff will review the TW Batch reports for any impact
