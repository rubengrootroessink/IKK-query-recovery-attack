Darrell - has Burlington disconnected from TW?  If not could gas flow at any time at this point?

Linda,
Here are two other points to update. Darrell told me that the BRI Jackrabbit poi # 500620 is active on TW, but not on Burlington's side. They are not set up to take the gas. It should be made inactive. Also poi 78161 & 500168 are the same point. We sum to poi 500168. So # 78161 should also be made not valid for Transport. 
Thanks Ramona

POI 500631 is an active, valid point in the San Juan Basin.  It has not started flowing as of yet.  It will stay in the groups it has been set up in until we are told otherwise by facility planning.
