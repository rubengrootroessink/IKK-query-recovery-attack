This shows that with a 350 Hp increase per unit, we would still not exceed operational Hp even in the winter.  We max out about 4500 Hp in the summer on a good day and this winter TW had a one-hour peak of 5500 Hp.  Adding 5500 + 350 Hp still is below the 5879 Hp rating for emissions.  I'm copying Larry to be sure that the assumption the air permit was issued for 5879 Hp is true.  I'll verify with Larry ASAP.

guys, the turbines at Bloomfield are site rated at 5879 HP.  Solar rates the three units at sea level for around 7000, but due to the elevation impacts on the units they are derated to the 5879 number.
