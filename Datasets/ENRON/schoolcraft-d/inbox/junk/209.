Terry stopped by to ask that all of us look at the Gas Plan -- the portion listing our points, the monthly imbalance and the cumulative imbalance.  

Probably this is Scott mostly -- Scott has the Oasis, EPNG, Lone Star group & Valero interconnects, Cara has PEPL, Robert has KN Pony Express, and Chris has Halley.  In any event, please take a look at this summary page of the Gas Plan.  We need to be aware DAILY if these numbers that are coming across are fairly correct -- are we in the ballpark, etc.  

The example we can look at is Oasis -- we don't see how we could be short 620,000 cumulative at Oasis yet that's the number that is being reflected.  Scott is already tackling this one.  Terry said we need to get in touch with Dale Ratliff to get the numbers corrected.  And, we need to do this today.  This is a high profile item that Dynegy will be looking at.

Terry has asked that we make sure Gary is always kept informed as well as the people who generally go to the meeting -- thanks.
