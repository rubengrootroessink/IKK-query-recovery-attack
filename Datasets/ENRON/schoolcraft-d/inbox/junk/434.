Larry Bertholf at Holcomb called today saying that this point was running 22# of water at about 1,000 mmbtu/d flow rate. He has notified the contract pumper that it will be shut-in tomorrow if it is not fixed. I have notified Jerry Knight (Oneok) and he will get a hold of his contacts with the supplier. Oneok is buying the gas at this point. I have already set the capacity at zero if he does shut it in Friday.
