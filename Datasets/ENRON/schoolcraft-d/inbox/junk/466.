Mike, I think we can go ahead and do the work. There is no flow affect right now, so I don't see a problem doing one unit at a time. Darrell what's your thoughts?

Here is a blank outage request form Mike.

Darrell / Jerry
We are about ready to install the unloader system at Station 8 to wrap up the automation project. We've been working on installing electrical and mechanical equipment without disabling the units. The valve people estimate 2 days per unit to install the valve actuators / unloaders and do some commissioning work. We just need one unit at a time.

Do we need to wait until the tarriff months are over? Jerry can you send me an outage request form?

Thanks
Mike
