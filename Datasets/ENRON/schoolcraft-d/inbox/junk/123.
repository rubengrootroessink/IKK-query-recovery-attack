, which is sent every two weeks to anyone in the energy industry who are in=
terested in news, features and interviews about everything from e-business =

y 4, 2002 Issue 45 (sample copy)      It remains an interesting time for th=
e energy sector...    In a scenario vaguely reminiscent of the California e=
nergy crisis, most of the news focuses around one big story- the continuing=
 Enron saga.  There's no lack of stories about the Enron disaster, and each=
 one seems to be more dire than the last.  With Congressional probes, secur=
ity guards posted at Enron's headquarters and the recent sacking of an Ande=
rsen partner, it looks like the story's still got a way to play out.  You c=
an keep up with all the latest including Al Massey's ongoing articles and i=
nterviews at Eyeforenergy.   We've got a packed briefing for you this week.=
  After focusing the last few editions on the developments surrounding dere=
gulation and energy trading in both the US and Europe, we're taking a close=
r look at two other issues of interest to the energy community-emissions an=
d weather.  Two of the articles below focus on the growing market in emissi=
ons trading-the first a look at the market, how it's developing, where the =
money's to be made, and the second article takes a closer look at the regul=
ations governing the market.  We've also got an article on the latest devel=
opments in weather trading which seems to be a growing part of many energy =
traders portfolios and is increasingly popping up on Risk Managers' radar s=
creens.   All these articles serve as an excellent segue into a few announc=
ements here at Eyeforenergy.  Just a quick reminder about the upcoming Euro=
pean Energy, Weather and Emissions Trading conferences in mid-February.  We=
