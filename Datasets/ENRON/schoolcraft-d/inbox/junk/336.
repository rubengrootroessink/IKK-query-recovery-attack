Karen,

OK, so I'm a little slow.  I am waiting for Darrell to get back with some additional information on Agave Dodd to verify the Lat ID and Mktg Lat ID, but here's what I see so far:

Because they are receipt points, the GRI indicator set at NO is ok since it's only applicable to delivery points
The supply basin for both should be changed from West Texas to Central
Verify which templates these points may have been added to and correct (s/b CE9REC)

Thanks,
Elizabeth
