D, 

Here are two San Juan outages the guys sent me. The date for Bisti is 04/12/02 for 12 hrs not 24. I put them in the system, and we can adjust the dates and flow affect as we need to. They were thinking that Gallop would be sometime after Station 4 overhauls are complete in May. I haven't heard about LaPlata yet.

Jerry
