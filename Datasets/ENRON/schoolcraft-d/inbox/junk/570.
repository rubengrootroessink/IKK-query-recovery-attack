Jerry,
Attached is a revision to push the outage back one week.  In fact it would fit my schedule better this way.

Thanks

Randy, the time table you have for this outage  is 02/26 to 02/28 to replace a section of the exhaust header. If we have cold temps the first part of the week, can this outage be pushed back a few days? 

Jerry
