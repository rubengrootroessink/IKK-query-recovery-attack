I don't mind giving you a overview of the unsubsribed CAS process, this afternoon.  I would suggest we have the meeting in my office at EB 4082, so I can demo the screens.  Buzz, if you are free it might be a meeting you would want to attend.

Due to Ramona being out Friday, I would like to keep this CAS overview scheduled for today, Thursday afternoon, from 1:30 to 3pm.  Ramona will be available for only a short time today.  Perry, if you don't mind, for today, could you show Jerry Skertich and I a CAS overview from your viewpoint.  Darrell, perhaps Jerry and I can get with you either tomorrow or sometime next week to get your viewpoint.  

Please let me know if everyone is okay with meeting today for about an hour.  I will see if I can get room 3907 for this afternoon.  Thx, Jim
