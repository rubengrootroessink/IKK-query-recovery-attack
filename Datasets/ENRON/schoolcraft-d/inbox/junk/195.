Since NNG is allocating storage you may get a call from USGT wanting to bring gas into NNG from Transok or Oasis going to TW. If they do they will  get all  parties on the phone and make sure everyone agrees to start flow real time at receipt and delivery point. Also USGT would need to fax a nomination into gas control the following morning so that it is accounted for. (Like we do with Minnigasco) Be sure and log this and let your relief know so that we don't miss it the next morning.
