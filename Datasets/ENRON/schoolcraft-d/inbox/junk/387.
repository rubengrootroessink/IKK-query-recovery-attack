I am having Dale set alarm limits on TBS gas temperatures. Several heaters blew out due to high winds in Minnesota today. Minnegasco noticed the low gas temps and reported them to the Field. The low alarm will be set at 20 degrees and the low low at 10 degrees. You should call the Field if you get a low alarm and if the gas temperature keeps trending down. Also, in the future, if Minnegasco notices low gas temperatures, they will call in to Gas Control, and we will make the call out to the Field. thanks. sj
