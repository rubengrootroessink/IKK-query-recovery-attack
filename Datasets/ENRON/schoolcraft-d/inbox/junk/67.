    Thursday, February 7, 2002 Issue 46   EDITORIAL  The hottest topic in t=
he energy industry this week remains the Enron disaster...    ...with Mr. L=
ay not showing up to testify in front of Congress, and attempting to dodge =
a subpoena.  The Enron fallout continues to threaten not only the wholesale=
 energy trading sector but the energy sector as a whole as companies retren=
ch to shore up balance sheets after downgradings by the market analysts.  I=
s Mirant's pull out in Europe and the continued French resistance to deregu=
lation threatening to put the breaks on the developing energy trading marke=
t in Europe or simply a bump in the road?  We'll be keeping an eye on it, a=
nd it'll certainly be the topic of conversation at the upcoming Energy Exch=
anges Online show in Amsterdam.   This week's briefing includes an article =
on a developing market within the energy industry--strategic energy managem=
ent for corporate customers.  Once large companies could count on their uti=
lity bills to be a constant monthly amount --well no longer.  With deregula=
tion, price spikes, the development of the wholesale trading market, energy=
 purchasers have been forced to become savvy comparison shoppers and risk m=
anagers all rolled into one.  Al Massey's article takes a look at what this=
 developing market means both for the companies supplying the energy and th=
e companies purchasing it.  In fact we think it's such an important topic f=
or the energy sector, we'll be running a conference in Philadelphia this Ju=

ent developments in the green energy market.  There's a lot going on in thi=
s area, and we're even shipping our journalist off on a field trip to a win=
d farm to give us a first hand look for an upcoming briefing.   As you all =
no doubt know, the Eyeforenergy team will be heading off to Amsterdam at th=
e end of next week to prepare for our Weather, Emissions and Energy Trading=
 conference extravaganza.  We're looking forward to seeing a large number o=
f you there, and for those of you who can't make it, we'll have a number of=
 reports in the next briefing on what our speakers had to say, what the lat=
est buzz in the industry is and what you need to look out for in the upcomi=
ng months.     --Allison Robertshaw, Editor    FOCUS   Managing Energy Reso=
urces in the Global Economy    The highly charged atmosphere of newly dereg=
ulated markets, coupled with rapid changes in the energy sector, Enron's me=
ltdown, and price volatility is forcing companies to reexamine the way they=
 have traditionally looked at energy.  Once considered the Bermuda Triangle=
 of the company balance sheet, the run up in energy prices is serving notic=
e that ignoring energy management is a recipe for disaster. Suddenly, energ=
y management has become a strategic issue that can burn a big hole in a cor=
poration's budget.  The rapid changes in the energy industry have forced ma=
ny companies to scramble to put together new business strategies, corporate=
