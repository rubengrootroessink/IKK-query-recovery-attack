Hey D,
Here's the outage for P3. What should I put in for estimated volume affect?

Jerry ,  I would like to tentatively schedule an outage to tie in the station surge control at P3.  We will need 2 days.  We will need to remove some material that we are going to reuse and test it before we can make our tie-ins.  We would like to schedule this for Tuesday, Feb. 19 at 8:00 a.m. and ending Wed. Feb. 20 at 5:00 p.m., 2002. 

The Pampa Team will be sending you an outage report.

Thanks,

Rick Brown
