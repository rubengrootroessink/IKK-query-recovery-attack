Subject:	outage request

Jerry, regarding the station #8 outage request #37 on outage report dated 01-17-2002.  We requested an outage to block in the mainline at  station 8 to replace a leaking scrubber valve.  After further research we found that we can change this valve without blocking in the main line.  Therefore that outage request may be eliminated.
Thanks
Mick  Becker
