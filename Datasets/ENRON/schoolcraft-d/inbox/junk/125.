Ron,

To the best of my knowledge it should not cause any quality problems to compress Redfield to a common B-C discharge.  There could be some concern with responding to an H2S treater upset at Redfield, but the travel time for the gas to reach Ogden is long enough to divert any gas from Farmland Ft. Dodge.

But the B-C common/D split idea was just an alternate to a C-D common configuration.  As long as we can make a C-D configuration and Redfield compression work out, we would never have any need for a B-C common/D split out configuration

Since we talked Gas Control was able to common up the C and D north on 01/29/02 and it has been running that way ever since.  It looks to me like we should be able to stay with this through low flows (like this weekend) and high flows (like this morning).

At current Redfield capabilities in the 300 to 350 MM/D range, the order of compression from low flow to high flow would be:

		Flow North	Ogden						Ventura	

		<300		Redf to C-D north				Bypassed
		300-375		Redf to C-D north & East regulated to C-D	Bypassed
		375-425		Redf to C-D north & East regulated to C-D	C to C-D
		425-650+	Redf to C-D north & B-C-D to C-D north		C to C-D

The flow rate where the D would have to be split out from the C is pretty high.  I don't expect that we will see demands that high.

Of course at high rates the C-D common saves a lot of horsepower vs. the D only north, probably 2 - 3 units less to get the same suction pressure at Ventura.  At lower rates the net compression savings is not as strong.  But the advantages are running Ventura verticals to minimize Ogden horizontals as well as delivering higher a suction pressure to Owatonna.

Some thought following our telecon this AM. We probably don't want to consider running the
"B" & "C" North common & compressing Redfield into it. Wouldn't that cause some problems
with gas quality to Farmland on the "B"? Thanks..
Ron Hagge
