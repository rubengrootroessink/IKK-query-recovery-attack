Max, 
I'll put all of these on the outage list, and we'll keep an eye on them as they get closer. I not sure we want to have the digs in the same time frame as our San Juan outages, Bisti, Gallop, LaPlata, and Bloomfield turn arounds, (4/2 to 4/13). I'm going to visit with Darrell and see if we want to move them out of that time frame.

Jerry
