Hi Shelley,

Through these stressful times of people moving around and the company restructuring and splitting out the pipelines, I strongly recommend that Darrell Schoolcraft remain with the TW pipeline group as manager/director of this pipeline group. He is very knowledgeable and very professional  in his duties as a coordinator and certainly would make an excellent  manager/director under any new restructuring plan. He's also been very helpful to me and others in maintaining a solid pipeline as well as keeping the lines of communication open between ourselves and our customers. Shelley, for whatever this is worth, he comes strongly recommended for this positon under any type of restructuring plan. Thanks.
