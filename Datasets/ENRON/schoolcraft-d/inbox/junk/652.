We are ordering hard copies of the regs as you requested, but in the mean time, you can read the official text at the following web site:

		http://ops.dot.gov/cfr2000/part192.htm

For gas, OQ is addressed near the end of the file at 49CFR 192.801, Subpart N.



		http://ops.dot.gov/cfr2000/part195.htm

For oil, look for the OQ Rule at 49CFR 195.501, Subpart G - also near the end of the document.......
