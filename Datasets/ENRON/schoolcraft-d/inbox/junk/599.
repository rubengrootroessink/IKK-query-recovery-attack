I received a call from Darrel Belt with the South Sioux team, he said that Terra Chemical's chromatograph has quit working and they are needing to know what the BTU is running for their operation.  We can give them the reading at South Sioux City from stream 2050, which is the Hooper C line.  They will be calling for this reading every 3 hours until Monday best estimate for repairs.  The easiest way to find it is NORTH REGION CHROMATOGRAPH then it is the first one on the list.
