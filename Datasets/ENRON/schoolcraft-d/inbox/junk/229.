Dan,
We will have pipeline repairs to do on the mainline in sections 7 & 8,  bet=
ween Stations 6 and 8.  PII is running a LAPA program on the smart pig resu=
lts from the pigs ran last September.  Once the LAPA results are complete, =
probably within the next 2 weeks, Earl Chanley will put together a scope an=
d estimate of work.  We don't have a date for the work yet, but probably wi=
ll be in the May/June time frame.  These smart pig runs are a part of Trans=
western's Risk Management Demo Project with OPS.  We will probably have to =
take the mainline to 60% MAOP for repairs, so there is a possibility for fl=
ow restrictions. =20
We also have budgeted to smart pig the Crawford Lateral this year.  Regulat=
ing flow for the proper pig speed may cause flow restrictions.  We don't ha=
ve a date for this pig run yet.  I'll work with Jeff, Max Brown, Darrell Sc=
hoolcraft, and Earl Chanley to schedule this and the pipeline repairs in se=
ction 7 & 8.
Thanks,  Arnie
