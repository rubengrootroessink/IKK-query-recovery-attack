The excavation has started at the red rock tie-in point at Station 1 (Kingman) for the new compressor. Depending on flows out west, we need to try and hold the suction pressure at station 1 under 806 with a differential no greater than 190lbs. Plant personnel and Gas Control will be monitoring the pressure during the day hours. After hours, until 5:00 pm and on Week-ends.  Gas Control will need to contact Larry Meeks who is the contractor on site and his number is 928-753-7145.
