CHECK DRUG INTERACTIONS
Did you know that Ibuprofen, a common drug found in over-the-counter
medicines like Motrin and Advil, causes major drug interactions when combined
with the prescription drug Coumadin? If you've recently received a sample
from your doctor, or are trying a new over-the-counter medicine, be sure and
be safe. Check for possible interactions between prescriptions, vitamins,
supplements, herbals or over-the-counter drugs you are taking on
Walgreens.com. Learn more here...
