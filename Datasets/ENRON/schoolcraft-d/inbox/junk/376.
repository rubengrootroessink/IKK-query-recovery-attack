Thanks for relaying this again.........Just make them aware this is sending out several Critical e-mails for each point every time they forget to change the reason code.  

Thanks!

One more thing, if you are uncertain as to what allocation code to put on the point or group being allocated or the information was not relayed to you from one shift to another. Please ask or call one of the Gas Control Team Advisors or Scheduling Team Advisors prior to allocating. This will assure that all individuals are using the same code for all cycles. If you have questions, please ask. Thank you.

Subject:	"FMJ" on the MOPS Outage

For the remainder of the Mops outage or until Gary or Darrell tell you otherwise, make sure that you select "FMJ" for every "CYCLE", while we are allocating. As this can and will cause confusion to the shippers and operators when they look at the posting on the EBB. As, we don't want the posting to be "Critical" one time and the next time "NOT Critical" the next. If you have questions, please ask. Thank you.
