I'll add the "fuel valve change out" to the scope of work to be done at that time.

The fuel valve replacement is scheduled for April 2nd, in order to accommodate everyone's schedule, contractors, Solar representatives, regional field engineers, etc..  This will coincide with our annual turnaround, which is scheduled for April 2nd through the 5th.  Unit A-102 is currently running in the normal solonox mode to prevent any compliance issues, but is being operated at a reduced RPM.  Hopefully this will satisfy all interests until repairs can be made.  If you have any questions, please call us @ (970) 259-8238.

I don't have an outage for fuel valve replacement yet. Would that need to be done during the scheduled turn around?

Has there been an outage scheduled to replace the fuel valve on unit 2 at La Plata?

Todd, where do we stand with the station control modifications?
