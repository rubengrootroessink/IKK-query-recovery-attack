Team,

This is the latest info that I know about MOPS.

There is a leak in the 24inch line. The entire system had to be shut down so that the divers would have safe working conditions.

There are currently divers on the sight.  Over the weekend they were not able to make repairs due to the inclement weather.  The EARLIEST the MOPS system can be expected to be up and running is late Wednesday night. 

If customers inquire please direct them to the bulletin board. Please do not disclose volumes or answer probing questions.  (Telling them that we think that MOPS might be back late Wed. night is ok.)  If you are in doubt you can refer any questions to me (I will probably ask Sherry or Chris:) I will be out on comp days Thurs and Friday in my absence please contact Chris Greaney at extension 3-4826.

It is also very important that we continue to allocate the 6 MOPS delivery points with the force majeure code. All customer who request critical day notices receive notices when that code is either 1) set on the timely and 2) removed on any cycle once set on the timely.  If you are in doubt please ask.
