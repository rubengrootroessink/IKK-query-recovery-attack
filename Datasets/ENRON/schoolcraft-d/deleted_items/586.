The Dumas plant is going to Derhime starting at 9:00 am tomorrow, Friday March 22nd.  They will continue to flow approximately 35,000 dth of raw gas.  They DO NOT have a processing agreement with OneOk at Bushton, but the gas will physically be diverted into the B-Line due to it being raw.  

The plan is for them to be down through Tuesday morning at 9:00 am, subject to changes that may extend the time.

Any questions, please call.
