Yes, West Texas supply basin is correct, East of Thoreau is also correct.  I'll ask TK for the other questions.

I have set up POI 78269 for this fuel delivery. I need someone to provide the following information in order to complete setup of the POI.

Is the West Texas Supply basin correct?
Is the East of Thoreau Area correct?
Should the point have GRI yes or no?
What is the Lateral ID to be used?
What is the Marketing Lateral ID to be used?

Thanks

Karen
