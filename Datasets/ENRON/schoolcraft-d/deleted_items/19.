  Gas Control looks at the 3 receipt/delivery points we have with Viking an=
d net everything out at Pierze. Dependant on pressures on both sides at the=
 Pierze point determines whether we have to run. We try to batch if we can =
on our side if it fits our operation. We may not always be able to do it if=
 it does not work for them. In some ways there maybe a trade off between ru=
nning Alex or Pierze.  Now that we are getting into winter months  we are g=
oing to want to keep our pressure up higher for Benson,  There may have bee=
n times that we may have lost a opportunity to not run Pierze, but sometime=
 it may look like a opportunity but all the pieces may not fit for everyone=
. Gas Control will continue to try shut Pierze down when they can and with =
the cooler temperatures Viking may run with higher pressure which would all=
ow us to free flow more often. Is there a economic difference between runni=
ng Pierze vs. Alex? We are always open for suggestion or ideas so if you se=
e something operational that would make for a better operation please give =
us a call.

Gary,

I think we have discussed this issue a bit at a Winter OPS meetings, but I =
was in Willmar the other day and took the to do to bring it up again.

When we run the Pierz Compressor, it is about $300 a day in electric bills.=
  That in and of itself, is not a big deal if there was no other way to ope=
rate the system.  It appears to us if the pressures on Viking's system stay=
 at a good level, we can free-flow nearly twice as much gas into our system=
 through valving and save the cost of running horsepower.  There were times=
 over the past months where we operated like that for extended periods and =
we realized a huge savings in O&M $$.  It did not seem to be a big deal to =
keep the unit idle.=20

We will not claim to understand all the "ins and outs" of the system.  We s=
ee our little part of the world, and it appears to us at least on the surfa=
ce, that there may be a much more economical and more efficient way to run =
one of our facilities.  We ask you to take some time and provide us with so=
me of Houston's background thinking on the operation of the Pierz Compresso=
r Station.

Thanks,=20
Tom
