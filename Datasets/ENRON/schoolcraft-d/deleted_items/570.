Bruce says parts (guide vain) should be in tomorrow and if so, they would have them by 1500.  The starters that are coming in from Kermit might not be in until Saturday.

I tried putting Hugo on this morning and it didn't start.  Bruce Pals and Mark Rinke have been trying to get the unit on line and it is unavailable.  The guide vain actuator came apart and the controller and 2 starters now have to be replaced.
