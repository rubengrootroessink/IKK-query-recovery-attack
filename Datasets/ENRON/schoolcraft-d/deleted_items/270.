FYI....

I have been asked to be part of a Focus Group on Enron. As I understand it,  HR is facilitating the effort to seek out employee attitudes and ideas. I don't have a lot of the particulars  but I thought it is an opportunity for me to represent any of the feelings and ideas you might have but don't know who to tell.... i.e.; what's going right or wrong and ideas on how things could be improved. I'll keep your comments confidential.
If you would add your thoughts to the discussion, drop me a note, call me or stop by and tell me.
I'll report back to y'all after the meeting...which is today at 3:00 p.m.
Thanks.....
Mike

p.s.....In my haste, I know I left some people off this e-mail.....Please pass the message to anyone you think might be interested.
