Darrell called and informed us that there is a turbine down at the Fullerton Plant POI 36511.  For the Gas Day of 10/17 we will need to  confirm down the location to 18,000 dth.  Darrell is changing the capacity for the Gas Day of the 18th through the weekend. We have contacted the operator and we are expecting a call back to instruct us for Gas Day 10/17 confirmations. We need ensure that the gas remains confirmed down through the ID2 cycle. 

If you have any questions please contact either Cara (5-2871) or Chris (3-4826)

Thanks.
