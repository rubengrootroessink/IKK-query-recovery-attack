A conf. call was held Thursday afternoon to further discuss the pigging tim=
eline of the San Juan Lateral.  Obviously there is concern with regards to =
delaying the pigging project and how that might relate to line eff and ther=
efore capacity impacts.  A request was made to re-apply the DRA asap or by =
April.  It seems that after the last pig run the line eff. held it's own fo=
r two weeks and then started to drop off significantly.  The major concern =
is, will we be able to continually bring the eff back to acceptable levels =
with dry pigging?  An agreement was reached to postpone any pigging efforts=
 until May or June while in the mean time we increase our pigging frequency=
 of the lateral and continue to monitor eff. results and cycle times.  In o=
ther words when we pig, how long before the eff. starts to drop significant=
ly.  Although it may be a long shot, if we can insure that by pigging on a =
two or three week cycle the eff. of the lateral can be maintained to accept=
able levels we may be able to postpone the DRA application until after Tarr=
iff months (July & Aug.).  Once through the hot tariff months we have an op=
portunity to make it through the remainder of the year.  $320,000 is on the=
 table for this project and that's why we really need to take whatever step=
s are necessary to delay as long as we do not jeopardize throughput....

Rick and I would be appreciate hearing your view points or concerns with th=
is plan but, in the mean time the following actions need to be taken:

1)  Send a sample of liquids and/or solids from the last pig run to Ben Asa=
nte for analysis.  (Gallup Team)

2)  Send a sample of solids from the inlet of Bloomfield to Ben Asante for =
analysis.  (San Juan Team)  This sample may have to come from a seal gas fi=
lter or fuel gas filter or???  Let me know if there are problems collecting=
 a sample in the next few days and we will put our heads togeather)

3)  Start pigging on a two week cycle.  Darryl S. agreed on the conf. call =
to take whatever steps are necessary to work with everyone on the pigging. =
 Please do not exceed 15 days between pig runs.  (Gallup and San Juan Teams=
)

4)  Collect valve data on the same cylcle time as the pig runs whenever man=
power and/or work loads permit.  (Gallup and San Juan Teams)

5)  Collect a sample of the liquids in the tank at Gallup and send in to Ti=
m Sweeny for analysis.  (Will you need to stir the tank before this is done=
?)  The reason for this step is we may have the opportunity to re-use the o=
ld DRA.  (Gallup Team)  Rick, you may want to contact Tim and insure he can=
 run this analysis for us.  (713-569-7973)  By the way, how many gallons do=
 we have in the tank at Gallup?  We will need 4000 to 5000 for a reapplicat=
ion...

6)  If the sample of the old DRA at Gallup determines that the solution is =
not fit for furhter use, work with Larry Campbell on disposing and insure t=
he tank is available for a May/June timeframe of re-applying the DRA.  (Gal=
lup Team)

7)  Gear up for an May/June timeframe to reapply the DRA if necessary.  (Ga=
llup and San Juan Teams)  Get togeather and pick two or three dates that wi=
ll work for you all and let Rick and I know.

8)  Currently all the project dollars reside in the San Juan Team's plan.  =
Advisors need to get with Vera and determine what distribution needs to mad=
e of those dollars to the Gallup Teams plan to insure overages are covered.=
