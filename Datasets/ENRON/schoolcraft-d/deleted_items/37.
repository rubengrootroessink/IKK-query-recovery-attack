I now have you guys slotted for an hour and a half versus the 45 min. in the first agenda.   Knowing you suckers feed off each other it was foolish of me to think one of you much less both of you could talk for only 45 minutes... Ha    Look forward to seeing the both of you.   (Kim will be addressing the Teams Wednesday morning so you can have her time Tuesday)
