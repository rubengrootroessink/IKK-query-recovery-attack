After utilizing the Gallup Peak Avoidance program and talking with Gary Choquette the following procedures should be used to minimize power usage during peak periods.  The unit should be slowed down when the digital Tri-State Power Peak In Progress (CLC) goes into alarm and reads "PEAK".  The unit should remain slowed down until the Tri-State Power Peak In Progress (CLC) returns to "NORMAL".  The program will be adjusted to insure the unit is slowed down long enough to avoid the peak.  The analog values are to provide advance warning that a peak may occur.  If you have any question call me at 713-853-1534.

Thanks
