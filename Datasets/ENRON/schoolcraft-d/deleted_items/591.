It seems like a lifetime ago, but the system actually behaved itself and didn't invalidate points on contracts or stall during any of the processes.

ID2:		No variances or manually scheduled items.

EVE:		Small variance at ANR due to problem with USGT at NNG-Halley.  Transcolorado is off, but I should be able to fix it on 		ID2.


See you later,  Bert
