Below is a list of additional TW displacement points that marketing/Gas Contral have approve for TW on IT & SP contracts. Please add to the Displacement IT Group and Displacement SP Groups.

Thanks Ramona

I have marked the ones below that I believe would be used as displacement points.

TK,
Here is another list of differences from old to new system. Are they displacement points?

Thanks Ramona

	In checking contract data on Sunday after we implemented, we have come across several delivery points that are in the old CBS system & they appear to be valid on pools and interruptible contracts. I know when we got together on our displacement list for the new system, these points did not come up from anyone as valid displacement points, so the new system does not have these points identified as displacement. Can you verify & let me know ASAP on Monday if these points below should be displacement points or not.

Thanks Ramona
