Ok 

What days did you say you would be out next week? I forgot I am going to the Shell Open.

Jerry and I will work with the Field teams and Tiny to see if late April might be an option.

Perhaps we should look at applying the drag reducer sooner.  With Bisti out of service, the drag reducer may give us some additional capacity.

What do you think?

Ben:  Please check and see if the DR application w/o Bisti gives us enough additional capacity to warrant an earlier application.

Thanks

FYI,
To stay out of conflict with some big EL Paso outages on the San Juan Lat. in May, we need to look at dates after May 21. Just a heads up.
