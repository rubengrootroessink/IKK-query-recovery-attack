Let Madeleine know ASAP about the arrangements.  We have a real cheap rate.  Let's not lose it.  I've talked to Rich J. and it's okay to start the PNM. meeting later.  They will supply lunch.  If you don't know, we have to take a shuttle to pick up the rental car.  Not like the old days at the terminal.
