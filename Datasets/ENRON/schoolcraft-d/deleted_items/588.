 Well it looks like they have change their mind again. As of now we don't know when they will be shuting their plant down.

I talked to Lavila Lawrence and Duke has postponed the "permanent" shut down of this plant.  The last date she gave me was April 1st but this has been extended to an undetermined date for now.

Soon as I heard anything different I will let everyone know.
