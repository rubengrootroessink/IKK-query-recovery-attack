Yes it is in the crate and I just got a phone call from James Fleak saying KDHE said we could install at Bushton.  Sometime this week we will ship it and hopefully start the assembly at Bushton next week.  Still hoping for a November 1st available date.

Jerry as mentioned a couple of weeks ago, we are still investigating the vibration issue on the compressor end of unit #26 at Mullinville.  To bring everybody up to speed (no pun intended) we have Hickham Industries scheduled to be on site WEdnesday and Thursday this week to continue the analysis.  My hope is to have a plan of attack this Friday, that will give us some timelines to shoot for.

As of today the outage I believe has been extended to the end of this month, and pending our analysis results it may have to be extended for a couple of more weeks.  Jerry, I will keep you informed if you can keep everyone else informed within Gas Control, Planning and System Optimization.  Thanks if you have any questions give me a call (515)275-9606
