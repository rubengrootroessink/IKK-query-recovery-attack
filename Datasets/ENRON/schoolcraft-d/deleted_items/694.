	Earlier this week I installed some new functions at station 5 for ease in controlling the pressure regulator when the 	station is down.

	Please install the following discrete and control points.  They will effect the setpoint on register 7025.

	1031 -  Input showing flow direction   0= west   1 = east


	1160 - Will put the control in West Flow  (write a 1 to this)
	1161 - Will put the control in East Flow    (write a 1 to this)


	If this doesn't make any sense please let me know.

	Thanks
	Todd
