Operations has approved the facilities at the NGPL/Eddy TW receipt point for gas flow immediately.  Until mods are made on an NGPL mainline compressor we are to expect IT noms only.  It may be several days before we should expect to see firm noms through this point.  Please call me with any questions.  Thanks for everyone's help in this and forward the message to those who need this info.
