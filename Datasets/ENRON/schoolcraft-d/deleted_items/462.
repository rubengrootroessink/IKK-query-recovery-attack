Wrenshall is continuing liquefaction and should be at full inventory in early February.  

Garner's York compressor is down.  On Monday they will decide how to proceed.  If they send the unit into the factory, then the current inventory of 1.75 Bcf will be the max for this heating season.

There may have been some misinformation that the minimum order for vaporization at the LNG tanks is 100 mmcfd.  In talking to the LNG operators they say that the following are minimum orders for vaporization:

Wrenshall  -  50 mmcfd

Garner       -  40 mmcfd

This is not the most effiicent operation for their units, but it is manageable.  

The utilization of the SBA Peakers at Carlton can be balanced with the use of Wrenshall LNG as a backstop.  On days when calling SBA Peakers 24 hours in advance is a borderline decision, it may be best to wait and use LNG if the situation warrants it.   In any case, the utilization of Wrenshall is encouraged, to allow them some run time.  Utilization of Wrenshall may be possible more often if the volume coming in is 50 mmcfd rather than 100 mmcfd.
