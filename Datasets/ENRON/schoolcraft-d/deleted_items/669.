	In verifying IT point contract data this Sunday after our implementation, we came across some point differences in old system to new system. Looks like possible displacement points for interruptible contracts. Should the points listed below be valid displacement points for Interruptible contracts? Please let me know ASAP on Monday.

Thanks Ramona
