Just wanted to let everyone know that I spoke with Theresa Juergens with Duke this morning.  Previously Bert had worked out with Theresa that Duke would give TW an extra 5,000 a day, Duke now wants to increase it to 7,000 a day for the 29-31.  I spoke with Helen in gas control and she said that is fine.

Thanks,
Christine
