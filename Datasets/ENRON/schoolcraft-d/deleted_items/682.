Jerry,  Again, I want to apologize for missing your meeting.  Our lawyers
won't let me leave town while we are preparing for the FERC hearing.

The attached calendars show the reductions of capacity coming out of San
Juan (blue bars), on the North Mainline going to California (yellow) and on
the Crossover going east from San Juan (green with outline).

In April, I will have to separate the Seligman and L 1300 jobs.  Can't have
both the same week.
