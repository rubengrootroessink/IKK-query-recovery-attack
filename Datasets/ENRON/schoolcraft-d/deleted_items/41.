Subject:	Gallup Peaks

When we slow Gallup down or take it down to avoid the electric peaks, please log it.  This will help the field to keep 
track of the days and give Rich Jolly and David Roensch (Tiny) the information they may need to answer questions.
Your help in this matter will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks DS
