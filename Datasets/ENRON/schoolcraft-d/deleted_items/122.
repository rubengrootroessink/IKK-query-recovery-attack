Rodney called to check in.  He did got to the doctor last week and got things fixed up.  Tomorrow he will go in for more testing for anymore leaks and then on Friday he actually sees the doctor to review all of the information from the tests with him.  Rodney indicated he's feeling much better but  just has no idea of when he'll be coming back.

Talked to Rodney.  He came home late Friday afternoon.  Recovery is very slow.  He had some trouble with some IV medication, causing heaving, causing a few broken stitches.  He goes back to the doctor tomorrow. Physical progress is slow, spirits are a little down naturally.  He felt like he was so close to coming back and then another setback. I'll keep you posted.

Rodney had his surgery last week. They went in and patched another fissure in his stomach.  The following day they took him back into surgery and removed his spleen.  I did talk to him this afternoon so at least he didn't have a trach but was on the ventilator for awhile.  He said he feels better this time around in his recovery.  He said the doctor would wait for a couple of more days before they run tests to check for anymore leaks (pretty much like hydrotesting he said).  Keep Rodney in your prayers.  Once again:

Subject:	RE: 9/18 - Update - Rodney Barnes

I called and talked to Rodney yesterday.  He's was doing pretty good.  Can walk about a block before he tires.  Also can tie his shoes now which though pretty simple it was not something he could do when he first go home, retrained the thumb muscles.  He lost weight, down to 161.  Can't eat much at one sitting but eats about 6 small meals a day.  He had wanted to try to come back on his set of nights this week but his doctor had some concern over more drainage.  They ran tests and he was waiting for the doctor to call him back.  

Steve January got a call yesterday evening from Rodney saying the doctor found another small hole in his stomach.  He was scheduled to go back to the hospital last night for an additional surgery to repair this.  Naturally Rodney was a little down about this since he had made so much progress.  I'll keep you posted.

Rodney is finally home!! He called in and visited with me before lunch. His trach is now out but he still has to hook at an IV with antibiotics 3-4 times a day at least for another month.  He finds it hard to believe that he has to use a walker to get around in his own house. Even has to have therapy for his thumbs since they didn't move, can't even tear a piece of paper.  He said he's glad we saved him a spot and didn't give up on him..

Really good news... Rodney called in yesterday.  He's in rehab and still has his trach but able to talk.  Sounded good and very happy to be talking to anybody considering what he's been through.  He commented on how he almost didn't make it.  Should be in rehab another week and then hopefully he thinks he'll be able to go home.

Pretty good news - Rodney is finally on the mend.  The one thing they discovered that the fungal infection that he had was resistent to the antibiotic they had him on, got that changed and he started to turn around.  He's still has the trach in but is off the ventilator, still in ICU.  Martha said he will probably go to a rehabilitation facility next week.  He's been laying so long he'll have to learn amoungst other things how to walk again.

Rodney had the tracheotomy yesterday and things went real well.  Breathing a lot easier but not totally off the ventilator yet.  Already feels better when he's awake, still sleeps a lot because of medication.  He will have to do rehab with his  breathing and somewhat with his walking since he's been down so long.  I'll keep you posted.

Just visited with Martha.  Things are a little bit better. Rodney is still on the ventilator. They delayed doing a tracheotomy but will do so probably tomorrow.  It's easier to wean him off the ventilator this way.  Martha said he's looking much better.  His blood pressure is more stable.  When he's awake he will wink and nod at her so he understands what she's saying.  So this is a big step up from where he was last week.

I called the hospital this morning.  Rodney is still in ICU.  I called the house to visit with Martha to get an update. She was asleep but an aunt at the house indicated there is not much change in Rodney's condition.  He still on the respirator and mostly sedated.  Said he will open his eyes but doesn't seem to recognize anyone.

I talked to Rodney's wife this morning.  He had the surgery on Monday, quite bit more extensive than they had planned.  There was a lot of internal infection.  He is still in ICU and on a respirator.  They hope to start weaning him off the respirator soon.  Just keep Rodney in your thoughts and prayers.

Subject:	RE: 7/12 Update - Rodney Barnes

Rodney's wife called this morning to update us.  He will be having surgery Monday or Tuesday to repair the perforation in his stomach.  The tests they did earlier this week revealed that it was not healing.  He can't eat or drink anything, nourishment through an IV only since nothing will stay in his stomach.  Doctor is trying to get his albumin level (amino acids) up before doing surgery since this aids the healing process.  Martha will call and let me know when surgery is actually scheduled.

I visited with Rodney's wife this morning.  He is still in the hospital.  There is a problem with a perforation sealing properly.  The doctors will be doing some tests today to see if things are progressing or if they need to do something different.  I'll keep you updated.

Hello,

I spoke with Martha, Rodney's wife tonight. Rodney was moved from the ICU unit today and into a regular room.  He is in Houston Northwest Hospital, room 476.  She is expecting him to remain in the hospital for another week.  I let her know that they are in our thoughts and prayers.
