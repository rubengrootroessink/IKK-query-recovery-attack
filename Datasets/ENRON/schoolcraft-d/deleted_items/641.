                       The suc set has been rasied back up to 687 which is about as low as we can go on this unit.  We were real close to tripping the unit on low suc press.  The reason is that the reading we are getting for the suc. pressure is in the YARD  and the trip alarm for the unit is set off the press on the UNIT itself , so the press at the UNIT  is lower than the reading in the YARD.   If you have any questions refer them to CHRIS GASTON  San Juan Team.
