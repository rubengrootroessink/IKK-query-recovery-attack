To all of my friends, I do not usually forward messages, but this is  from my good friend Pearlas Sanborn and she really is an attorney.  If she  says that this will work - it WILL work.  After all, what have you got to  lose?
 
 
 
SORRY EVERYBODY.....JUST HAD TO TAKE THE CHANCE!!!
I'm an attorney, and  I know the law.  This thing is for real.
Rest assured AOL and Intel will  follow through with their promises for fear of facing a multimillion dollar  class action suit similar to the one filed by PepsiCo against General Electric  not too long ago.
 
 
 
We're not going to help them out with their e-mail beta test without  getting a little something for our time.  My brother's girlfriend got in on  this a few months ago.  When I went to visit him for the Baylor/UT  game.
 
 
 
She showed me her check.  It was for the sum of $4,324.44 and was  stamped "Paid In Full".  Like I said before, I know the law, and this is  for real.
 
 
 
Intel and AOL are now discussing a merger which would make them the largest  Internet company and in an effort make sure that AOL remains the most widely  used program, Intel and AOL are running an e-mail beta test.
 
 
 
When you forward this e-mail to friends, Intel can and will track it (if  you are a Microsoft Windows user) for a two week time period.
 
 
 
For every person that you forward this e-mail to, Microsoft will pay you  $203.15.
 
 
 
For every person that you sent it to that forwards it on, Microsoft will  pay you $156.29.
 
 
 
And for every third person that receives it, you will be paid $17.65.   Within two weeks, Intel will contact you for your address and then send you a  check.
I thought this was a scam myself, but a friend of my good friend's  Aunt Patricia, who works at Intel, actually got a check of $4,543.23 by  forwarding this e-mail.
 
 
Try it, what have you got to lose????
