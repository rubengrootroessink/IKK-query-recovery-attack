Per our discussion on Friday, attached are the spreadsheets that show the
dig locations for the integrity work. Please look at the column that shows
Mile Post since there is a lot of other information on the spreadsheet that
you do not need.  We will need to have the pipeline pressure less than 655
when we excavate these locations.  We need to discuss outage dates after you
have a chance to look at the locations and do some modeling.

 One spreadsheet shows only the dents from 8-7 and 5-4 mainline and 5-4
loopline.  All of these need to be excavated. A second spreadsheet shows the
pits from 7-6.  These all need to be excavated since they did not meet the
LAPA calculation criteria.  Then, a third spreadsheet shows the pits from
8-7 and we are planning to only excavate a couple in order to verify the
LAPA calculations with R-String calculations.  There are no dents from 7-6
which need to be looked at.

8-7
From 8-7 there are 3 dents on the mainline and they are all in an area where
the pipeline is not looped. These will all be excavated and a sleeve or
clock spring will be installed.  There are a couple of pits on the line that
will be excavated.  We will start with the pits at mile post 28.567 and
28.570.  These are in the segment of line that is looped.  If the R-String
calculations on the pits agree with the LAPA calculations, we will recoat
the line and stop with those two.  If they do not meet the LAPA
calculations, we will continue with the next closest one and continue on
until we get some agreement.  We can do the two that are not in the looped
segment last, if we have to, but we do not expect to have to excavate more
than the two.

7-6
The spreadsheet shows 19 pits that need to be checked.  However, 3 of them
have already been replaced in the Becker Flats work order, which leaves 16
pits.  Of the 16, only one is in the area that is looped.  (Murphy's law at
work here.)  All 16 pits need to be  checked and repaired with either a
sleeve or a clock spring.  However, there are really only 8 sites since some
are very close together.

5-4 Mainline
All five dents need to be excavated and sleeved or a clock spring installed.
All are in the area that is looped.

5-4 Loopline
All eight dents need to be excavated and sleeved or a clock spring
installed.  All are in the area that is looped.
