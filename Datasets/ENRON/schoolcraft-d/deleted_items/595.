Jeff,

The MAOP limits you have here sound real good to us. I visited Alan and Richard (2 of our Gas Controllers) and they had a good suggestion. When we get into a situation where we lose a station or a major delivery like Socal, and we know we will be at or above MAOP due to the roll back. Would it possible to set up the stations where the Gas Controllers could send a set point to take that station off line and put it on idle?  

Pros-  1. It would give the Controllers time to make other moves.
           2. It would give the teams time to get to the station if needed.
           3. It would reduce ware and tear on the units. (Starting & Stopping) 
           4. It would reduce call outs, which reduces overtime.

Cons-  1. There could be some $ cost to set it up.

This looks good to me.  If you don't have any issues with this we will proceed.  Comments?

Yes, I forgot to get back with you on this.  Jon Hendricks, Scott Hill and myself got together last week and thought this might be a good approach.

The control system does pretty good with control of the units until they get down to minimum speed and that is where we get into problems.  If we get over 1010 psi on the mainline or 2psi over maop on any system we will look at the governor speed and if it is not at minimum we will speed up the process trying to get back to maop.

If we are over 2psi (.2%) and at minimum speed for 2 minutes we will take one unit off line and wait for 5 minutes to see if we need to repeat this and take off another unit.  At anytime if we hit 1015 or 7psi (.7%)over maop we will keep the station shutdown and all units will go down.
1015 is where we will have the pressure switches will be set.  I feel that we should be comfortable with these numbers as we will not ever get over 1% of maop unless we have a failure of the system and at this point the relief valves will protect us.  We will have to have several failures for this to occur.

If you feel that this is a good plan please let me know and we will come up with the programming to make it happen.
We can start implementing this right away and should be able to get it done by the end of the year.  We would  be quicker but we seem to have a lot going on right now.

Thanks
Todd

I got busy and I know you probably did too.  Are we making any headway on a strategy?

Thanks,
