	Received a call from Peoples Co-op Service today and spoke with Phil Swenson (507-288-4004).   He informed me that there will be an outage of electrical power to Chatfield Compressor Station on 01/22/02 @ 0800 to 1600.   Phil would like to receive a call back to proceed with the outage so he can schedule it with the electric suppler.

                                                                        Thanks
