We will continue monitoring the A line H2O reading at Sublette which is now reading approximately 13.8 pounds of water. This is the H2O content of the Haskell and Sublette field after it has been dehyed.  It is important to remember that the A line is discharged into the B Line suction thus the H20 is being blended down to 1 pound.  If you have any questions call me or the Sublette Team.

Disregard Sublette's A-line H20 readings at register# 7079. Scott at Sublette station is having George Marshall remove it from the system. Sublette is not flowing up the A-line anymore. We need to continue to focus on the B-line moisture.
