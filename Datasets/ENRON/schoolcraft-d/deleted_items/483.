Can we be on the agenda the afternoon of the 22nd? We would not need more than 30 minutes. Unfortunately, I have to be at another meeting in Omaha, so the attendees will be; Jerry Graves, Darrell Schoolcraft, and Gary Spraggins. Let us know what time is best. thanks. sj

PLEASE NOTE:

Dan's Director/Staff meetings scheduled for January 22 - 23, 2002 will be held in the Enron building.  Originally these meetings were going to be held at the Sheraton Houston North.  I have canceled all reservations with the Sheraton.

You need to make your own hotel reservations at the hotel of your choice.

January 22 - 23, 2002 meetings will be held in EB13C2 (7:30AM - 5:00PM).  Agenda will be distributed at a later date.

Call me if you have any questions.  Thank you.
