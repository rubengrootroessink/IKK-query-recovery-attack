Dale ,
You need to make to where we can change the trailblazer nom on the north end plan.  We had a Minnegasco storage deal and needed to make a change to trailblazer and we couldn't do it due to it automatically downloading.  Some points automaticly downloading is fine, but I would appreciate it if you would fix this for us.

                                    Thank you,

                                     Margaret

The Gas Control Morning Meeting Report has been change to improve the presentation of the information in the morning meeting.  To facilitate this a number of changes were necessary on the North and Central Plans.  The most notable change was the addition of a column showing the spot rate.  There are other minor changes involving how the load is calculated in the average and spot column.  There have been no changes made to the future days on the plan.  Also, there have been minor changes made to the Permian and Anadarko plans but the basic functionality is still the same.  If you have any problems or have any question call me at 31534

Thanks 
Dale
