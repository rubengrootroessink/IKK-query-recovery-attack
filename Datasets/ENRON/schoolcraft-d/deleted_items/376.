 19 THINGS THAT IT  TOOK ME 50 YEARS TO LEARN by Dave Barry 
 1. Never under any  circumstances take a sleeping pill and a laxative on 
the same night.  
 2. If you had to identify, in one word, the reason why the human race  has 
 not achieved, and never will achieve, its full potential, that  word would 
be "meetings." 
 3. There is a very fine line  between "hobby" and "mental illness." 
 4. People who want to share  their religious views with you almost never 
want you to share yours  with them. 
 5. And when God, who created the entire universe with all  of its glories, 
 decides to deliver a message to humanity, He WILL NOT  use, As His 
 messenger, a person on cable TV with a bad hairstyle.  
 6. You should not confuse your career with your life. 
 7. No  matter what happens, somebody will find a way to take it too  
 seriously. 
 8. When trouble arises and things look bad, there  is always one Individual 
 who perceives a solution and is willing to  take command. Very often, that 
 individual is crazy. 
 9.  Nobody cares if you cannot dance well. Just get up and dance. 
 10.  Never lick a steak knife. 
 11. Take out the fortune before you eat the  cookie. 
 12. The most powerful force in the universe is gossip.  
 13. You will never find anybody who can give you a clear and  compelling 
 reason why we observe daylight savings time. 
 14.  You should never say anything to a woman that even remotely suggests  
 that you think she is pregnant unless you can see an actual baby  emerging 
 from her at that moment. 
 15. There comes a time  when you should stop expecting other people to make 
a big deal about your  birthday. That time is age eleven. 
16. The one thing that unites all human  beings, regardless of age, gender, 
 religion, economic status or ethnic  background, is that, deep down inside, 
 we ALL believe that we are  above average drivers. 
 17. The main accomplishment of almost all  organized protests is to annoy 
 people who are not in them. 
18. A  person who is nice to you, but rude to the waiter, is not a nice person.  
 19. Your friends love you anyway.
