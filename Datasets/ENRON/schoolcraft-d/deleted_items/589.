Darrell,

Ben at Conoco would like to know the answers to the questions listed below. His 3rd question below, I think he means 705,000 instead of 205,000.

Thanks,

Tracy

Tracy,

Can you please help me with the following?

What is the total capacity for the San Juan lateral?
What is the total capacity for the Mainline West of Thoreau?
On April 2 the Ignacio to Blanco line is going from 705,000 to 0 with La Plata dropping 500,000 through April 5.  When does the 205,000 come back online?

Thank you,
Ben
