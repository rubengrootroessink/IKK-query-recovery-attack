Just so that everyone is aware, the units at Station 4 can be operated at l=
evels above their rated horsepower of 4,000 during periods of lower ambient=
 temperatures.  Clark ambient rating increase from 100% torque at 100degF t=
o 108% torque at 40degF.  I realize that this rating is weather dependent, =
but the horsepower is available if weather temperatures permit.
=09To obtain ambient rating as ambient temperatures permit, three unit modi=
fications would have to be implemented; these might be handled by unit cont=
rol programming only.  Clark allows ambient rating when jacket water and lu=
be oil temperatures can be driven down proportionally to 135 and 125 degF r=
espectively.  Jacket water and lube oil control valves may be needed to red=
uce jacket water and lube oil temperature as ambient temperature permits, a=
nd unit control programs would require modification to accommodate ambient =
ratings. =20
=09There may be environmental emission issues such as permitting the site f=
or the higher horsepower.  Also, previous checks with Legal indicated these=
 units could operate in the ambient rated zone if the units were purchased =
with this capability; ambient rating capability was part of the original pu=
rchase and stated as such in the unit purchase orders.
=09Again, I am just making sure everyone is aware of the unit capability at=
 Station 4.

Subject:=09FW: TW Sta. 4 capacity in 3 unit scenario=20

Viewing Tip: maximize window and increase zoom to 150% to get better view o=
f figures below (View, Zoom..., select percent number and type 150)

Based on recent capacity concerns or inquiries by E&C, Gas Control and Oper=
ations regarding Compressor Station 4 capacity in a 3 unit Red Rock Project=
, Planning and Optimization have re-evaluated models to put these concerns =
to rest.  Figures 1 and 2 below detail steady state results from modeling t=
hat Planning used for determining the respective capacities, as have been p=
rovided in the past. =20

Figure 1 shows the pipeline simulation maximizing horsepower at CS 1, 2 & 3=
 to pull discharge pressure off of CS 4, thus allowing CS 4 to operate with=
in its Rated HP (11800 BHP).  Note: CS 1, 2, & 3 in the first diagram Figur=
e 1 are modeled conservatively using 83% efficiency; however, Gary Choquett=
e represents that having evaluated the horsepower curves made available by =
the vendor, there is still much horsepower available for compression at CS =
1, 2 & 3.  The compression efficiencies at the stations may be achieved as =
high as 87%, thus providing more capacity to pull gas from CS4.  It is cust=
omary Planning practices to error on the conservative side until facilities=
 are installed.  Once installed and the true performance can be realized th=
en the opportunity shall exist for further optimization.

Based upon the pipeline model with CS1, 2, & 3 at 83% efficiency, the range=
 of conditions that may be expected at CS4 are suction pressures between 76=
9 - 776 psig with discharge pressure at about 923 psig.  The HTSCompress mo=
del for CS4 has been modified to closely match field performance testing.  =
These results shown in Figure 2 also represent that the 1230 MMcfd capacity=
 will be more than achievable even at the lesser operating conditions shown=
.

However, if any capacity shortfalls might be experienced, several measures =
can be implemented to improve conditions (some of which are currently plann=
ed).
1.=09Operate San Juan Junction pressures at or above 960 psig (currently ac=
hievable, measure would provide higher suction pressure to CS4)=20
2.=09Perform engine and compressor overhauls at CS4(work is slated for Marc=
h-April 2002 timeframe)
3.=09Install/modify scrubbers and inlet piping at CS4 to reduce inlet pipin=
g losses (work is slated for post Red Rock, scrubbers from CS 1, 2, & 3 wil=
l be relocated to CS4)
4.=09Relocate evaporative cooling skirts from CS 1 or 2 after Red Rock unit=
 installation to CS 4 to prevent horsepower derating due to high ambient te=
mperatures.
5.=09Modify programming at CS4 to optimize speed control maximizing availab=
le HP (this done at existing CS 1 & 2 have realized 1% throughput improveme=
nts).  Also modifying unloading sequence could be considered.
6.=09Pig/clean main and loop lines from CS 5 to CS 4 (pipeline efficiency i=
n this segment is lower compared to segments due west, cleaning would incre=
ase suction pressures at CS4 or allow lower junction pressures.)
7.=09Maximize available HP at CS1, 2, & 3 (all horsepower at 86% efficiency=
 as shown in second diagram Figure 1)

Should further discussion be required, do not hesitate to give us a call.  =
A conference call can be scheduled if needed; otherwise, save this informat=
ion for August 2002.  EF
