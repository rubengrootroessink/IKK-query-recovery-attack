Some users were having sporadic problems logging on to TMS this morning.
Don Daze finally isolated the problem to two terminal servers.
He took those out of service, and the problem has gone away.

All testing was completed, but we were notified by the TMS On-Call that they are looking into some problems with TMS.  They will update us as they have more information.   We have confirmed with the ENW Resolution Center that the Exchange servers are up.
