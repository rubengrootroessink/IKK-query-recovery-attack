	I'm confused?  Are we allocating at this time to be sure the imbalance does not
	grow any more?  Thanks. Lynn

that would be one of our options if they don't cash out the balance as of 12/31/01

	If I understand correctly, the scheduled volume is continually higher than the flow?  Why don't
	we allocate this point to minimize the imbalance?  Just a thought?  Thanks. Lynn

Who is the marketer assigned to Devon SFS Operating?  

Devon owed TW $161,292.49 as of 12/31/01 related to oba contract 21749.  There is one point on this contract(Bilbrey 28 Fed 1) which flows about 500 mmbtu per day.  Devon is currently having problems delivering gas into TW which is increasing the imbalance further.

Devon has told Amy that they will possibly cash out but they haven't made a commitment yet.  If Devon doesn't cash out and they do not lower nominations on this point, then we will have to explore other options to get this gas/$$$$.  

Amy will continue to follow up with Devon and pursue cashing out.  

thanks
Richard
