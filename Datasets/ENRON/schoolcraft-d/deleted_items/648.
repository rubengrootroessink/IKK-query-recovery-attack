Bisti unit went down at 1415 on 03/14/2002 unit BSD not an ESD. There was no evidence of a fire
so the Team reset the fire eyes and tried to start the unit back up. The unit failed to start because the
units PLC ( processor ) went out. After trying to fix it and to no avail it was decided to send for a new one 
at Bloomfiled. After the team installed the new and tried to start the unit it was evident the new one was
bad also. So we tried to track down Solar for advice. All there reps are in Wyoming, So we talk to a 
few of there specialist and they said we needed a new PLC. Keep in mind by now it's midnight PLC are
 hard to find late at night so we called a few good friends  ( Northwest Pipeline ) and located one in Colorado.
 After we got it to Bisti, It was installed and the unit came right on line just to have another BSD still no avidence
 of a fire but this time the winding temps on the unit were over 400 hundred degrees, Shut downs at 250 so the
 team began to trouble shoot the problem it was decided to us one of the spare wires in the winding box and see 
what would happen
