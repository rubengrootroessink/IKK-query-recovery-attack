The reports used in the Morning Meeting have been changed.  A new sheet called the "ets_west_region_tw_summary" has been added to the TWMAINLINE spread sheet, it is used to show long and short for the TW system.  For the morning meeting you will need to press the  F9 key, hit the Internet button, and then print this sheet.

Print and copy of the TW Map on one side, print and copy the "ets_west_region_tw_summary" on the other side,  print and copy the NNG Summary sheet separately and take to the morning meeting. The morning meeting report will now be 2 pages long.  If you have any questions call me at 31534.
