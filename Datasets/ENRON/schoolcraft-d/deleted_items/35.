Just a quick reminder that all choirs sing this Sunday morning, October 21.


We had a great time at the recording last Saturday and I've missed you since
then.  I'm so proud of you all!!  See you Sunday!  Love, Dick

P.S.  We will pass around a sign-up this Sunday for your commitment to
participate in the Christmas program.  The deadline to commit is Sunday,
November 4.  Make sure you have sandals for Act II.  Those of you who are
new and have costumes will need to have your costume approved by Nancy
LeBeau by October 28.
