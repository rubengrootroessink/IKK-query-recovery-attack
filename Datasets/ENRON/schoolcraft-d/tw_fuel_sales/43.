I am doing fine!  I can't wait until Friday because we leave Sat. morning for Hawaii!  I have been practicing on my Hula, but have not perfected it yet!  John seems to be enjoying the practice!

Hope you guys are having fun.  Tell Lynda happy birthday from me.  

Jerry has been doing a great job.  He is much quieter than you.  He even lets me sit in your chair!

TK
