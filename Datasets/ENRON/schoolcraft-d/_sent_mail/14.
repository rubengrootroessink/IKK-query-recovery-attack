Darrell, unfortunately those who need to be at Station 4 are traveling back home from a PEP/PRC meeting we had in Albuquerque yesterday.  

Time frame to analyze the malfunction unloaders should include 3-8 hours travel for the Analyst and Division Mechanical Specialist.  Presently, outage was requested for Wednesday, June 6th, from 8am to 6pm.  Initially, that outage was to accommodate program changes to the Unit Control program.  This outage also needs to include unloader inspection, which means there will be substantial downtime of Unit 401during the day.  Do I need to provide other information because unloader inspection will be performed?

We found out last Thursday which unloaders were not functioning correctly.  I have asked Steve SanMiguel to circulate a memo detailing which unloaders are not operating correctly.  This memo should be sent today.

If outage arrangements, other than the filling made for June 6th, can be made earlier, please let me know as soon as possible.  I will be on the road headed back to Amarillo today.  My cell phone number is 806-886-8105.   Otherwise, I will assume we will be on schedule to do this work June 6th.

Thanks
Ken N Young

Ken,

We currently have a unit down at Station 4.  If you need to work on something now is the time to do it and not wait until June.
