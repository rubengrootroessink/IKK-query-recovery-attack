Subject:	Outage update on unit 103 at station 1

On may 26th unit 103 went down on high bearing temp #4 main bearing. In the last two weeks this bearing has been changed two other times due to high temp problems. The last time the bearing was changed Roy Smith identified a high spot in the saddle area. This would cause a heavier load on the bearing and would result in temp problems. Today (Monday 28th) we worked on cleaning up the high spot. We also identified that the bearing that was installed also had a bonding problem. The babbitt on the bearing was pealing off. We then installed a bearing and took a complete set of deflection readings. The readings on number 2/10 throws indicated that the #4 main bearing is not over loaded. How ever the readings on numbers 7/15 indicate that #14 main is loaded heavy and might explain why this bearing is running higher then normal. Tomorrow ( Tuesday 29th.) we plan on making some adjustments to the chocks to relieve some of the load. 
  On Tuesday and Wednesday the Kingman team will be changing a turbo and after cooler. Myself and Roy Smith and two Tehas crew members will be working on the main bearings. We should have the alignment and bearing problem resolved by the time the turbo work is complete. 

Ronnie.......
