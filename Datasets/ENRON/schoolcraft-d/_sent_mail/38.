Is there a reason we think we will need to run station 8.  I think with the volumes we will have to move to insure 6 miles and hour for the smart pig
will be approx. 100 to 200 m2.  If my thinking is wrong please let me know.  

DS

Subject:	Concern - Possible Change In Smartpigging Dates

This is to advise that if we are now actively looking at rescheduling the smartpigging dates that was previously agreed upon at our Albuquerque mtg on April 11th, we need to know ASAP.  We do not have alot of flexibility in juggling schedules based on smartpig tool availability, but we can sure check and see what shakes out.

Plz let me know at the earliest possible date what the plans are here.

Thanks - Max

TW - Station 6-7 & Station 7-8 Smart Pigging - C.014524/C.014527
Project will conflict with Station 8 Automation Project if conducted in September or later.  Actively chasing TD Williams and PII for their cost estimates.  Must review costs to determine if dollars are sufficient.  Project should try to be a done in August or sooner if at all possible.
