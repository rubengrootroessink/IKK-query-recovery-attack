OUTLOOK EMAIL NOTIFICATION

Your Date of Migration is: May 2nd

YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO SEND E-MAIL unless you take the following action:
Please go through your Notes email and clean out as many old/un-needed email items as possible BEFORE your date of migration.  After you are migrated to Outlook you will only be allocated 100MB of total Mailbox space.   If more than this amount of data is migrated to Outlook YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEND E-MAIL until it is below the 100MB limit.  Cleaning up your Notes email now will prevent this from happening to YOU.

Enron's messaging platform is migrating from Lotus Notes to Microsoft Outlook 2000 worldwide.  You will be accessing Outlook for all of your email functions. 

WHY IS ENRON MIGRATING TO OUTLOOK 2000?

Many factors contributed to the decision to migrate from Lotus Notes to Microsoft Exchange/Outlook.  The most prominent factors were:

?	Significant advantages to moving to a product that is more integrated with current Enron apps (Windows 2000, Office and Internet Explorer)
?	More efficient Shared PC and Roaming User features
?	Improved support and integration for Palm/CE devices
?	Instant Messaging capabilities

WHAT IS BEING MIGRATED TO OUTLOOK 2000?

?	Email Messages.  From the date of your scheduled migration, the last (30) thirty days of your Email will be converted for use in Outlook.
?	All your folders in Notes you use to store email messages in.
?	To Do Items
?	Journal Items
?	Calendar Entries dating from (1) one year in the past to (10) ten years in the future will be converted.
?	Address Books, but NOT your Distribution Lists that you created.  You will need to re-create these in Outlook.

Thank you,

Outlook 2000 Migration Team
