Salisbury,

I'm sorry.  I don't know what information you might need.  Nokia is a brand
of cellular phones.  I have a couple different Nokia phones and prices.  If
you are looking for rate plans, it might be easier just to call (any time,
even in the evening).  There are so many rates and a few that just rolled
out yesterday.

If you'd like to call I can be reached at 503-860-2500.

If not just let me know what you are looking for.

Susan Nothnagel
