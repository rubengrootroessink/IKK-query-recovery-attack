Community Affairs has 2 pair of tickets left for tonights Beaver game.  
If you would like to go, I'm giving them to the first 2 people who respond.  
Keep in mind, members of the community will be in the box tonight.  

While we're not asking anyone to "host" the box, there might be some 
general questions about Enron, so please bear that in mind before you respond!
