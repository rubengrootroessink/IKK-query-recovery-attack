Internet Outage:

There will be a very temporary (10 seconds or so) internet outage at 5:45pm tonight  as we switch from using the PGE route to the Enron Houston route.

The IT contact for tonight is:

Chip Cox
503.464.8916 
503.703.0536

PGE is doing maintenance on their firewall tomorrow and to avoid a prolonged outage we will be using a different path to the internet.

Tonight we are just testing the alternate path and will be back on the PGE route around 6:00 PM tonight after testing.

Tomorrow, around 6:45PM, we will once again reroute our traffic to Enron Houston's Internet path while the PGE route is down for about 2-3 hours.
This will again cause a very brief outage that will most likely go unnoticed by most.  After PGE has completed their work, we will jump back over to their service.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
