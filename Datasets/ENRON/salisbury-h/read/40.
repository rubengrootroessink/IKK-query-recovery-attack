MPC-DETM-EPMI-AVISTA-GCPD.

Duke was unable to purchase transmission for this path on preschedule.  Duke has notified everyone in the path that they will be purchasing the transmission in real time.  EPMI real time group needs to monitor this and make sure they get the upstream from Duke and pass it on the Avista.  Avista will make tags.  

According to Drew/Duke, Montana will generate at Colstrip and the transmission should go from Colstrip to Garrison, then another leg of transmission from Garrison to GCPD system.

If you have any questions, let me know.

Thanks, Donald Robinson.
