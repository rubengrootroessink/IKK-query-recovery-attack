We have parking with PNM for off-peak on Monday.  The energy schedule is as follows.  The energy is at 4C but you should be able to move it to PV with PNM if you ask nicely.  We will split the upside over $35 with ST SW via annuity.  Please make all transmission purchases or other sales under their book.  

Deal number on the buy from PNM is #581199.

The shape of this length is:

HE1	50
HE2	50
HE3	50
HE4	50
HE5	45
HE6	20
HE23	35
HE24	50

Day total is 350.

Thanks
Bill
