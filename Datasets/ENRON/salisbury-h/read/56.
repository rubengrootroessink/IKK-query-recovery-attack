Group,

Whoever is working on Sunday (I think it's Steve and Leif), you will be receiving a call from East Bay Municipal Utility District.  They are in NP15, and they have 3mw available real-time for Monday, HE1-6.  They will be calling looking for your bid sometime Sunday afternoon.  They are pretty much a price taker, so don't be afraid to give them a bid that's quite a bit below the market.

You will do the transaction over the APX trade application.  All you have to do is go into the "bilateral" screen, and when you see the trade come up at the bottom, you just have to highlight it, right click, and then click "confirm bilaterals."  When you schedule it in CAPS, it's just an SC Trade with the APX, there's no generation schedule associated with it on our end (the APX will put in the generation schedule).

If you have any questions you can give me a call on my cell, 503-819-1132.

Thanks,
Stan
