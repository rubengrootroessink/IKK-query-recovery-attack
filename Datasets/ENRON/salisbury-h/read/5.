Real Time:

1.  We need to sell 60 MW Peak Hours 7 - 22 on Sat 5/26 for Harbor.  Anything north of $150 after commission is OK.  South of $150 is a little dicey, and we might take the dec.  I will call in Sat morning to see how this is going.   

2.  Please make sure we have submitted supplemental energy bids offering 80 MW @ $250 for all hours on Tuesday for Harbor (harbgn_7_units)

3.  Arco might call with a unit outage for Sunday for a few hours.  Their day ahead price was $85 and they might want to lock in a price for 19 MW for HE 5 - 12.  Susan Kolbush is the contact.  They might just buy the inc, however, if prices are soft.
