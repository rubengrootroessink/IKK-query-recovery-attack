Dear Holden,
 
You have been provided with access to PIRA  Online, PIRA's Internet-based energy library, as part of the Retainer Service  that your company has with PIRA Energy Group. 
To access the online service, please  go to our website at www.pira.com .  Once you  enter the site, click on the "Login" prompt on the left bar to enter the Client  section of our website. At the Login  page, you will be prompted for a User ID and Password.  Please enter the following codes (NOTE:  they are case-sensitive):

Once you have entered the Client  section, you have three choices for accessing your information.  In the center of the page we list PIRA's  latest 10 reports for all fuels; on the left is an option to go directly to the  most recent issue of the main reports for Global Oil, North American Gas,  Electricity, and European Gas; and at the top of the page you may select  "Latest" to retrieve PIRA reports issued over the last 30 days by fuel, or "All  Reports" to retrieve all PIRA reports (archived and recent) by  fuel.
