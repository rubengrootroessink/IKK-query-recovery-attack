Holden I am going to be in Houston Wed - Friday.
I completly forgot about this when I told you we could get together tomorrow to go over this.
I will be back in the office Monday.  If you want to look at it before I get back Fran or Samantha could help you.
If not I will be more than happy to go through it on Monday.

For right now this is the way it worked: 1) Deal entered: created New Deal Value
2) Changed deal: created a change in existing deal value in your "change in price"

-> our project is to locate these numbers and tie back to them.

Sorry for not getting with you today.

Heather
