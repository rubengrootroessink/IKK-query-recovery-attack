Please join me in welcoming Mo Elafandi to the West Structuring Desk.  Prior to joining Enron, Mo worked for First Union Securities in Corporate Finance.  Mo has also worked as an analyst for Exxon Corp., a reliability engineer for Texas Instruments, and served as an officer in the US Navy for seven years.  Mo has an undergraduate degree in Engineering from the US Naval Academy and an MBA from Duke University.

Additionally,  I will be leaving for Houston on Monday, May 21 to begin working on the EES project.  Initially, I will spend most of my time in Houston and return to Portland periodically.  I will continue to oversee the functions of the West Structuring Desk and have complete confidence in our current team of Jeffrey Oh, Glenn Surowiec, and Mo Elafandi.  As soon as I have a telephone in Houston, I will forward this information.

Todd
