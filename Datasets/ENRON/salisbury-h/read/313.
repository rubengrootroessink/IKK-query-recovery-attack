By now you have probably seen Rick Causey's announcement of the iBuyit initiative.  iBuyit is Enron's new procurement and payment tool and is now live for those who previously requested IT hardware from IT Central.  For others, iBuyit will be coming your way during the year.  To learn more, visit http://ibuyit.enron.com.

The iBuyit team will continue to work with your business unit to customize the tool to meet your needs and to prepare for its phased roll-out:
May 2001:  iBuyit Payables for those organizations supported by the Houston-based accounts payable processing center
July 2001:  iBuyit eProcurement for ETS, Corporate, and EWS
October 2001:  iBuyit eProcurement for EES and EBS
December 2001:  iBuyit eProcurement and Payables for Europe

We look forward to your questions and comments about iBuyit.  E-mail us at <mailto:ibuyit@enron.com>
