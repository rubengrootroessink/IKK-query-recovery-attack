Subject:	Transmission purchases

I have purchased 78mw of transmission monthly firm from APS for May , Palo Verde to West Wing.  The oasis number is 21253 and the deal number is 594301.  This replaces the daily transmission that I had previously purchased.

I also reserved 50mws of tranny monthly firm from APS, Palo Verde to Four Corners 345.  This is from 5/2 - 5/31.  Oasis # is 21254, deal number is 597347.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks
