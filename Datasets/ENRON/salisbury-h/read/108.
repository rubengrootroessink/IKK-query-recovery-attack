FYI
I do not work with any of the PIRA reports.  I distribute the MegaWatt, Gas, and Electric Daily reports (which may be accessed on the Enron home page under publications).  I also distribute the California Energy Markets and Northwest Clearing Up reports once a week.  Contact me if interested in receiving any of these.
