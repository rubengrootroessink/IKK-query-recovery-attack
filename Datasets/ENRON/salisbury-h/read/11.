This is just a reminder that you have signed up to take Derivatives on Monday, June 4 and Tuesday, June 5.  As class size is limited and there are people on a waiting list, unless I hear otherwise by Tuesday, May 29, I will expect that you have made a commitment to attend this class for both days.  Here are the details of the course.

Date: 	Monday, June 4 AND Tuesday, June 5
Place:	World Trade Center Bldg 2, Mezzanine 5
Time:  	8:00 am to 5:00 pm

Lunch will be provided!

For your information, Tim Belden has asked to be alerted of any last minute cancellations or no shows as he feels that the training opportunities that have been presented are important for your development.
