This is a reminder that the following training is available starting today and available Thursday and Friday.  The training room has changed to the Cascade Conference Room.

It is a great opportunity to take advantage of professional training on Outlook!  Anyone using laptops will want to go to one of the sessions, and it is recommended that all Enron administrative staff attend one of the sessions.  If you have any questions, please contact Dave Steiner or me.
