A lightload schedule was cut in preschedule.  The path is BPA C#23928-EPMI-SEMPRA-MIRANT-SNOH(T)BPA(T)BPAP/BE #96092NF-BPA(T)BE/NOB #359363F-CISO(T)NOB/SYL-CISO(T)SYL/SP15-MIRANT(SP15).

This path is run 25mw for HE1, 4-6, 23-24PDT.  It will run 24mw for HE2, and 22MW for HE3.
HE2 was cut by 1mw.  Mirant plans on booking out the 1mw with BPA in real time.
HE3 was cut by 3mw.  Mirant plans on booking out the 3mw with BPA in real time.


Thanks, Donald.
