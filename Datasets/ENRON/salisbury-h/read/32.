Chip,

	The issue seems to be that of an Information Risk Management problem where they haven't pushed out all the application access to Holden's profile.. I had put in a ticket with (31411) under your name for this matter on Monday. I will call them and ask them to escalate this matter.

regards

Hi Asem, just wondering if you've gotten any updates on the Foster Application issue for Holden Salisbury. 

Thanks,  Chip
