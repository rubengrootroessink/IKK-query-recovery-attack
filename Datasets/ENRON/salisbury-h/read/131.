I am told ISO hosts media calls on occasion during emergencies where they talk about system conditions with the media.  I have asked CAISO to be notified of such calls.  If you are interested in knowing about such calls or listening in, please let me know.

If you would like an email sent to you anytime a Stage 1/2/3 is called, sign up on www.incident.com.  This site was recommended to me by the CAISO media rep.
