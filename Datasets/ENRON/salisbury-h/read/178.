We will be having a group meeting on May 10th at 4 PM. We will be discussing tagging, changing fundamentals, and group changes.  Pizza will be provided.  I would like to have these meetings on a monthly basis to stay on top of the changing market and to keep everyone updated with changes on the floor.  If you cannot make the meeting or have something in particular you would like discussed, or have a preference in pizza, please let me know as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Bill
