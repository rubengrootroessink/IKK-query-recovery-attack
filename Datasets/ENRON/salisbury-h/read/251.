I am pleased to announce that Jim Reyes has joined the Volume Management group.   

Jim comes to us from the Finance Group at EBS here in Portland.  He will be spending the next few weeks rotating throught each of the VM  chairs 
and familiarizing himself with the responsibilities of those positions.

Please take a moment to stop by and welcome Jim to Enron North America.

Thanks,

Murray O'Neil
