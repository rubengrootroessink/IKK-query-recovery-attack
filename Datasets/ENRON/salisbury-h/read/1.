I have been asked to forward on some information from our Bloomberg Sales Rep Kristin Hordyke.

They are holding a free Energy Seminar on July 11th @ 1:30 pm in the Heathman Hotel.  You can sign up directly from your Bloomberg Terminal under the  Bloomberg University function, option #2.

Also for those of you who are interested in a training session on the Bloomberg terminals, Kristin Hordyke will be in Portland July 12th and 13th.  Please let her know if you are interested in learning more about your Bloomberg.

Please feel free to contact Kristin with any questions at 415-912-2978 or email her at khordyke@bloomberg.net

Thanks,
Diana
