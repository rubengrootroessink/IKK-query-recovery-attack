Group,

Our discussion forum notes as a group are significantly improved in the pas=
t 3 weeks in many areas.  I believe communication in the group at shift cha=
nges is improving and is quite good in general.  However, there is always r=
oom for more improvement.  Specifically, other traders in the group and on =
the floor would benefit from more detailed information regarding outages.  =
Please try to include the reason for a plant derate as well as the ETR when=
 a unit is lost.  I would also highly recommend notifying the cash desk in =
the region affected by the outage, either by email or verbally.  An importa=
nt outage was recently missed by both the real-time group and another cash =
desk on the floor.  Real-time had ready access to the information concernin=
g the outage but did not pass that information on to others in the group at=
 the shift change or others on the floor.  In this case, such poor communic=
ation simply made us look foolish.  We work hard for (and justly deserve) t=
he solid reputation we have on the floor.  Let's make sure we do the little=
 things to maintain it.=20

Again, keep up the good work.
Bill
