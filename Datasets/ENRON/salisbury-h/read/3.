I found that the said icons where never moved out to Portland.  I have moved these and added the foster security group to them.  All they should have to do is refresh there start menu..  I checked the scripts and the installation packages and they are correct so everything should work properly.

If you have any problems feel free contact me about it.

Michael,

	Holden Salisbury, trader in our PDX office, seems to be having problems [emails included below] with getting full access to the Foster project's applications. Seems that when he browses through his program menu's on his local machine he sees only Oasis Net Exports and Transmission Ticker and when he goes through TerminalServer he's got access to all of them, he needs to be able to access all apps [ Transmission Ticker, Net Exports. Transmission Offerings, Reservation Reports, Batch Scheduler, ATC reports] from his local machine.  IT IRM  contacts up on the Portland side are Chip Cox [503-703-0536] and David Steiner [503-703-1553]. Please do let whomever know what needs to be done in order to get this resolved.

thanks in advance

I need all of the Foster applications on my local profile.  I have some of them on local and some of them on my terminal server profile.  I need the same Foster profile that Diana Scholtes has on her local machine.  As of this morning I still do not have it.  Please let me know when my profile gets updated.

Thank You,
Holden

Chip,

	The issue seems to be that of an Information Risk Management problem where they haven't pushed out all the application access to Holden's profile.. I had put in a ticket with (31411) under your name for this matter on Monday. I will call them and ask them to escalate this matter.

Hi Asem, just wondering if you've gotten any updates on the Foster Application issue for Holden Salisbury. 

Thanks,  Chip
