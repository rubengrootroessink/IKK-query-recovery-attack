Dear ST-SW,

   I have added deal # 615628 for 3-31-01 to account for Line Loss charges on transmission reserved by the ST-SW desk during 
March 2001. 
   The calculation is as such:

   ($769,538.28 total) x (2.3% of total Kilowatt hours of energy provided)  = $17699.38 for MWh

   Detail is in your box.  Please contact me with any questions.

  Thanks,

  Virginia
