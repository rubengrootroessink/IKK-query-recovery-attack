Our upstream is Sempra, our Downstream is Mirant, it is a llh schedule that was cut by 1 mw HE 4-6, 23-24.  Mirant is taking it to real time, and Snohomish who is generating agrees with this.

Please call Mirant for the hours above to make sure everything is being handled.  The path is marked in lotus notes with a cut symbol.
