Mark,

As per our discussion attached to this message is a proposed general outline of the main characteristics of a DSTAR RTO.  This document should be as Trader friendly as possible.  If it doesn't easily and quickly convey the types of information that are important to you, please let me know and we will develop something to meet your needs.

Please forward this information to Tom and anyone else you think needs to see this information.  In advance, thanks for your time.

Kind Regards,

Dave
