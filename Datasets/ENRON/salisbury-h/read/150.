Mark - since these deals are now valued in Enpower (effective Apr 01):
570272: LTSW buy from STWR
573463: LTSW sell to CSU
563945: STWR buy from WAPA 

we do not have to enter an Annuity between LTSW & STWR because Enpower now calc's the daily position STWR is managing.
Before the system was not so we had to calc the annuity and enter this once a month (between LTSW & STWR the position you are managing).

Currently you have an annuity to WAPA for the premium payment on the Option Deal#563945
(Annuity Deal#563969)
May payment = $83200 (dated 5/31)

If you have any additional questions let me know.

Heather
