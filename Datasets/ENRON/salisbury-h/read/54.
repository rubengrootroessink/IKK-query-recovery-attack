As stated in the previous note, the detm-epmi-gcpd schedule was cut to zero for HE23-24pdt on 5/21, Monday.  Duke will resupply in real-time.  EPMI real time will need to make sure you get an upstream from Duke then tag the schedule for these two hours.  I have already cancelled the first tag and made a new tag for HE1-6pdt.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks, Donald.
