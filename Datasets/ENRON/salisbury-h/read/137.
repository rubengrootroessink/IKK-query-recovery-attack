As we all know, our activation date of the AT&T DS3 is drawing nearer (projected date at this time is 05/31/01). Until that date we still have a large dependency on the Terminal Server (TS) environment in Houston. If you have a TS issue, please follow the below steps:

?	Ask co-workers around you if they are experiencing TS issues
?	is it TS in general or a specific application
?	Contact a member of local IT support (Steiner's Team & Mike Tully)
?	Communicate your findings
?	IT support will troubleshoot and, if needed, escalate to local Development team (Poston's Team) or TS support team in Houston (Hawthorn's Team)
?	Communicate to you status, resolution, and permanent fix (if applicable)

If you require to have the TS session reset extended for running the reports, please contact Andrew Hawthorn directly via email. This request has a 1 day turnaround SLA. This process requires one server to be isolated for your use which impacts others in the ENA world.

Dave Steiner and Andrew Hawthorn (TS Support Team Lead) and their respective teams will continue to do their best to maintain a stable environment for your business needs. When unseen issues occur, they will do their best to address them in a timely manner. Please continue to communicate your business needs through Dave Steiner. The one exception to this will be requesting the TS session timeout extended.

Following are agreed upon SLAs from the TS Support Team:

	NEW REQUESTS				SLA	
	Application moved to TS	production		1 week 
	TS session reset extended			1 day
	H:\ drive creation in Houston for TS		2 days

We all understand that there are times when unforeseen circumstances arise and the above notice is not possible. IT will work with you to do the best we can to meet your requirements.

Please advise if you have any questions or concerns.
