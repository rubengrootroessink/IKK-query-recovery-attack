Morgan called and informed us, I called EPME and let them know.  They should make new tags.


LLH path: PPOA-PPOA(T)PPOA/BCAB GF-BCHA(T)BCAB/BCUS #299499NF-PPOA-DUKE-SUB(T)BPA(T)BCUS/GCPD #96038NF-DETM-EPMI-GCPD

was cut to zero for HE23-24pdt on Monday.  Duke called us, I called GCPD.  Duke will resupply in real time!!!!!!!

I will make a new tag for the first six hours.  RT will make RT tags for the last two hours.

Thanks, Donald.
