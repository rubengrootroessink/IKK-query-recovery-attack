After reading the WACM tarriff,   we do have to return losses for the day we use the transmission on the same day.  If we have multiple transmission reservations and we use more than one, we have to aggregate all of the losses together and return them as a single schedule.

If we don't pay the losses on the same day that the transmission is used, then we are forced by their tarriff to pay the financial cost, which they assign.

Losses are calculated at 5.5%,  and broken into LLH and HLH return. (standard rounding applies)

Please let me know if you have any questions.
