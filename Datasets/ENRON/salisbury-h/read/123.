Group,
We are short in SP-15 for HE 7-22, 50 mws at $429.  We have 50 mws from LV Cogen for HE 7-10 at $185 at Mead 230.  We will need to submit the tranmission requests this evening for tomorrow morning.  We will need to contact NEVP, WALC and the CISO on this import 2-3 hours before it flows.  Purchases and sales for this 50 mws should be made under ST-WBOM(Les has made the purchase from LV Cogen and the sell to us).  California is also 50 mws short in SP-15 on peak (Deals should be made under their book).  Temperatures should be off substantially tomorrow from today.
Please call me with any questions.
