Customer Support Group is committed to continuous improvement of our service.  This survey focuses on the services you receive from the Resolution Center, Desktop Support, Hardware, and System Access Support.  In order to improve, we need to hear from you. This survey should only take about 5 to 8 minutes to complete. Your input is key to our success. The deadline for returning this survey is April 20, 2001.  We appreciate your participation.
