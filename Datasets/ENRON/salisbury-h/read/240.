ENRON MS WALK - RAIN OR SHINE
Saturday, April 21
Walk Begins 9:00 am sharp
World Trade Center 
121 SW Salmon
Portland, Oregon


CONGRATULATIONS!  Your commitment to join TEAM ENRON has helped our TEAM be the LARGEST MS team in the state of Oregon.  This is a great achievement and one that we can all be proud of.  Your commitment to this Walk and the pledges you raise will help to find the cause and cure for multiple sclerosis.

At the time of this email notice, approximately 150 TEAM ENRON walkers have registered.  The following Q&A will provide instructions/directions in order for us to have a successful Walk this Saturday!

Where is the Enron MS Walk held this year?
This year's Walk begins and ends at 1st & Salmon Street, near the Salmon Street Springs - in Waterfront Park.  Registration will be  directly across the street at Two World Trade Center (middle building of PGE's offices at 2nd & Salmon).

What time does the Walk begin and how far is it?
The Walk begins at 9:00 am - rain or shine!  You can elect to walk in the 5K or 10K - no decision or commitment needs to be made; just decide the day of the event.  It is recommended, due to parking constraints, that all Walkers arrive downtown by 8:00 am, in order to complete required tasks before the Walk.  

Can I bring my dog with me?
You sure can!  All TEAM ENRON dogs are welcome to walk with their owners for this great cause.  All dogs should have leashes.  Just be sure to bring along your own pooper-scoopers for this purpose. 

Where do I meet up with TEAM ENRON?
TEAM ENRON walkers will meet around 8:30 am near Salmon Street Springs - look for the TEAM ENRON sign.  There will be lots of activity and people in this area, so plan ahead to meet up with your fellow TEAM ENRON walkers no later than 8:45 am.  

I haven't received my TEAM ENRON t-shirt - what do I do?
Because of the number of TEAM ENRON registrants and the various locations of our TEAM walkers, it may not be possible to deliver t-shirts to each walker.  Therefore, if you HAVE NOT received your TEAM ENRON t-shirt by the end of the work day on Friday, April 20, please plan on picking up your t-shirt between 8:00-8:30 am on Walk Day.  Pick-up location will be at One World Trade Center on the Bridge Level (at the top of the escalators).  T-shirts will be distributed at this location from 8:00-8:30 am  ONLY..

Am I suppose to wear my TEAM ENRON t-shirt at the Walk?
Yes, yes, yes!  As the title sponsor of this year's Walk for the state of Oregon, we want to show off our name and support for this great cause!  

What if I have NOT turned in my pledge form to a Team Captain before the Walk?
No problem.  We encourage you to turn in your pledges at the MS registration tables at Two World Trade Center prior to the Walk that morning.  Most of you have received the yellow notice and white envelope in the mail from the MS Society.  This envelope is to be used to put your pledge form and collected dollars/checks in.  If you did NOT receive the yellow notice and white envelope in the mail from the MS Society, they will provide an envelope for this purpose at the MS Registration table. 

Upon turning in your pledge form at the Registration table, you will receive an MS walk t-shirt.  (For those that have already turned in their pledges prior to Saturday, the MS Walk t-shirt will be delivered or sent to you.)

I thought I was pre-registered and the pledges would be picked up prior to the Walk.
Again, because of the various locations for our Walkers, it may not be possible to pick up all pledges.   If your pledge form is NOT picked up prior to the end of the work day this Friday, you will need to do the following:
1)	Pick up your TEAM ENRON t-shirt (instructions above)
2)	Go to MS Registration Table to turn in your pledge form
3)	Pick up your MS Walk t-shirt at the same time you turn in your pledge form. (You will only receive your MS Walk t-shirt once your pledge forms have been turned in.)

I have a friend that wants to walk but isn't registered, can they register the day of event?
Absolutely.  Send that friend to the "Walk On's" table in the Registration area.  Be sure to have them sign on as TEAM ENRON walker!

Do I need to bring anything else with me for this Walk?
If you plan on carrying anything with you, ie,identification, wallet, MS walk t-shirt, water, umbrella, camera, munchies, etc., you may want to carry a backpack.  


Does Enron match employee contributions?
Enron will match Enron Broadband Services and Enron North America employee contributions.  If you have not completed a matching form, please contact your team captain.  These employee contributions are matched 100% and adds up easily.

Is this tax-deductible and how are receipts given?
You bet it is tax-deductible.  If a pledge is $75 or greater, a tax-deductible receipt will be sent directly from the MS Society.  However, if the pledge is less than $75 and a receipt is requested, a receipt needs to be provided by the Walker.  You can pick these receipts up at the MS Registration Table or contact Judy Timson, 503/886-0501 or email her at judy_timson@enron.net.

What if I have not collected all my pledges OR have forgotten my pledge form at home?
Not to worry.  You have until May 25 to turn in your pledge forms and dollars to the MS Society, in order to be eligible for the prizes offered by the sponsors of this Walk.  If your pledges are turned in after the MS Walk, they should be sent as follows:

			National MS Society
			Portland Chapter
			1650 NW Naito Parkway
			Suite 190
			Portland, OR  97209
			(Phone 503/223-9511)

How does this work for TEAM ENRON prizes IF my pledge form does not get turned in the day of the Event?
The TEAM ENRON deadline is earlier due to the key prize award of two round-trip airline tickets on Continental Airlines. In order to be eligible for this prize, you must have ALL your pledges into the MS Society by April 30th. 

How am I eligible for the two round-trip Continental Airline tickets?
One of the TEAM ENRON walkers will walk away with this grand prize.  On May 1, the MS Society will confirm with Judy Timson which TEAM ENRON walker successfully raised the most dollars.  Judy will then contact the grand prize winner by phone. Notification of the WINNING WALKER will be sent out, via email, to all registrants that provided an email address.  GOOD LUCK and continue collecting - you could be the lucky winner of this wonderful prize!


I thought there were other incentive prizes - what are they AND how am I eligible for those?
For every TEAM ENRON walker participating in the MS Walk, your name will be in a drawing to receive one of the following prizes:
?	Overnight Hotel Package at The Benson Hotel
?	Overnight Hotel Package at The Riverplace Hotel
?	Overnight Hotel Package at The Marriott Downtown Hotel
?	Overnight Hotel Package at The Marriott Residence Inn
This drawing will take place on April 25.  The winners will be contacted by phone; notification of these WINNING WALKERS will be sent out, via email, to all registrants that provided an email address.

Are kids allowed to walk and is there a Prize for them?
Yes, kids can participate in the Walk.  All kids will be eligible for a $25 gift certificate to Toys-R-Us, with one lucky winner taking home this gift certificate.  This drawing will take place on April 25.  The winner will be contacted by phone; notification of this WINNING WALKER will be sent out, via email, to all registrants that provided an email address.

Are TEAM ENRON walkers to meet after the Walk?
No, due to participating in the 5K or 10K and due to people's own walking times, it would be difficult to hold a gathering afterwards.  However, we encourage all TEAM ENRON walkers to enjoy the activities, booths, music, refreshments, food, etc., that will be provided at the end of the Walk.

What if I have questions?
Please feel free to call Judy Timson, 503/886-0501 or email your question: judy_timson@enron.net.  

Walk in good health and have great time!
