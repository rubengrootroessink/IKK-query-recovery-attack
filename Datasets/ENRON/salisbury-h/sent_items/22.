Good Evening,

We just completed the Chapter 11 application to zero-out the schedule volume on selected deals.  The new executable is located at  o:\portland\westdesk\california scheduling\chap11.exe.

We did some preliminary testing with Phil Platter and all looks good.  We will migrate the new application to production on Monday using the traditional method so that it will be accessible from the Enpower toolbar.

Phil can show you how to create the short-cut.

Thanks,  David Poston
