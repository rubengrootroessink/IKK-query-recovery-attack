BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets has recently completed the first transaction for a new 60-day fixed price product for the lumber industry. Available for delivery in Houston and Dallas, the product is offered by Enron in the over-the-counter market and via Clickpaper.com, Enron's Internet-based transaction system dedicated to the forest products industry. The first transaction was completed via Clickpaper.com on March 14 with a major lumber buyer in the southern United States. This represents the first online fixed price transaction contract in the industry. With the growing volatility in the lumber industry, the availability of a long-term fixed price product provides companies with another opportunity to mitigate their exposure. Additionally, this transaction represents the convergence of Enron's increasing involvement in physical lumber transactions with our recognized expertise in financial risk management.

In addition, EIM has announced that it has completed its acquisition of the Quebec City, Canada newsprint mill and related assets from Daishowa Forest Products Ltd. In July 2000, Enron purchased Garden State Paper, a recycled newsprint mill located in Garfield, NJ. The acquisition of the Daishowa mill now positions Enron as the seventh largest producer of newsprint in North America. The Daishowa mill in Quebec City will now be called Papiers Stadacona. The new name has great historical significance to the local community in Quebec City. When Jacques Cartier first explored the mouth of the St. Charles River in 1535, the aboriginal people living there referred to the village as Stadacona. This is now the site of modern-day Quebec City. 

Enron Freight Markets
In March, Enron Freight Markets (EFM) completed the acquisition of Webmodal, Inc to help launch the traditional intermediary transportation business.  EFM also started its spot trading business and completed 981 transactions in its first month.

East Power Origination
On Tuesday, April 3, the St. Lucie County Commission voted 3-2 to approve the Midway Energy Center near Fort Pierce, Florida, which is a 510 megawatt peaking power plant.  Next steps for this facility include receiving a water permit from the South Florida Water Management District and an Environmental Resource Permit (ERP) from the Florida Department of Environmental Protection.

Enron Canada
Ken Lay addressed a breakfast meeting of the Toronto Board of Trade on Wednesday, April 4, as part of the "Power Breakfast Series".  His topic was "Moving Forward with Electricity Deregulation."  Before his speech, the chairman of the Board of Trade commented that "this was the best attendance ever" at one of their breakfast meetings.  After the meeting, Mr. Lay spoke with reporters from Reuters, the Globe and Mail, the National Post, and Report on Business TV emphasizing Enron's commitment to deregulation of the Ontario power market.

IN THE NEWS

JAPAN: Enron presents power plant plan to Japan government
TOKYO, U.S.-based Enron Corp on Wednesday presented plans to build a liquefied natural gas (LNG) fired power plant in northern Japan, aiming to become the first foreign company to build such a plant in Japan. The move brings Enron one step closer to realizing its plan to build a power plant with an initial capacity of two million kilowatts in Aomori prefecture.
"We submitted our basic plan to build the plant to the governor of Aomori prefecture today in line with last November's announcement," Tatsuro Seguchi, president of Enron Corp's Japanese affiliate Encom Corp, told a news conference. "We are aiming to start construction of the plant in 2004 and start operations by 2007 since Japan's power market is one of our highest priorities," he said.    03/28/2001  Reuters English News Service   (C) Reuters Limited 2001.
