We have two positions open for Trading Assistants with UBSW Energy.  One will work for Jeff Richter and Chris Mallory on the Cash Trading desk and one will work for me and Mike Swerzbin on the Term Trading desk.

In short, the Trading Assistant helps the traders run EOL markets, provides analytical support, prepares daily market summaries, reviews trade press for pertinent information, performs checkouts with brokers and counterparties, assists in pricing new deals.

Please send an e-mail to Amy Fitzpatrick by noon on Tuesday expressing your interest.  This position is open to both Enron and UBSW employees.

Tim Belden
