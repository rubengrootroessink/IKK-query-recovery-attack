Try 816 969-8995 for a fax number.  Let me know if this one does not work.  The phone number for my contact is 816 969-8953.

Thank You,
Holden

Holden and Kysa
Do you happen to have a phone number for WestPlains, we are having trouble faxing to the fax number 816.936.8775.  Or do you happen to have a different fax number for deal 819089.01

Thank you
