I sent this email out on Friday morning after talking with Radonna.  I was given the wrong email address and was not aware of this until today.  Please accept this email as my notice.

To Radonna or responsible party:
 
I would like to give my 30 days notice to move out  today.  Please let me know if you need any further information than  given.  Our address is 3354 SW Beaverton-Hillsdale Hwy, tenants are Holden  and Tamara Salisbury + family.  We have our new house on June 1st and would  like the opportunity to recoup our June rent.  Please let me know the best  way to accomplish this.  I can be reached on my cell phone if you have any  questions.  The number is 503/807-5669.  Radonna informed me that  email would serve as a valid form of written notice.
 
Thank You,
Holden
