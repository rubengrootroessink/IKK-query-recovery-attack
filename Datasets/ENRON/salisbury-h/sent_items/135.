REGARDING THIS TEST, A QUESTION HAS ARISEN ABOUT ACTIONS TO BE TAKEN
SHOULD ANOTHER (NONTEST) UNIT TRIP DURING THE PERIOD WHEN AGC IS
SUSPENDED FOR THE TEST.
The CMOPS Chair, the Test Director and WSCC Staff discussed this
question and all are agreed that the control area(s) affected by
tripping of a unit not intended as part of the test should return AGC
to service and attempt to meet DCS requirements.

To all WSCC Control Area operators

This is the 7 day notice of WSCC System test on May 8, 2001
for the proposed Frequency Responsive Reserve (FRR)
 Operating Policy obtaining the system response information
 under the existing MORC spinning reserve policy.

The WSCC is proposing changes to the Operating Reserve policy
 that would change Spinning Reserve practices to newly proposed
 Frequency Responsive Reserve (FRR). The new policy specifies
 the minimum MW component of FRR that should be achievable in
 60 seconds. A Summer(Fall) test is also being planned for June 7.

**
During the generator dropping tests all WSCC Control Areas are to
 suspend AGC 3 minutes prior and restore 4 minutes after the
 generator trips.

This is to have unhindered governor response throughout the system.
**

The test sequence is similar to the June 2000 WSCC System Test

WSCC Frequency Responsive Reserve (FRR) generator dropping test
 May 8 (light loading)

All times are in Pacific Advanced Time (PAT) and are subject to change
 when the tests are finalized.

May 8, 2001

1250	Make final preparations for compliance with test objectives
		to be completed not later than 13:10

1310	Start continuous sampling of SCADA data (2 second sampling if
possible)

1315	Chief Joseph Dynamic Brake Test 1

1317	AGC suspended and disable plant setpoint control at Hoover.
1320	Hoover (750 MW) generation trip
1324	AGC on
		and restore generation setpoint control to normal
1325	Start Hoover generation ramp-up
	 (restore to pretest level within 5 minutes.)

1337	 AGC suspended and disable setpoint control at NW RAS
1340	NW RAS (1250 MW) generation trip
1344	AGC on
		and restore NW RAS generation setpoint control to normal
1345 	Start NW generation ramp-up
	 (restore to pretest level within 5 minutes.)

1350	Stop continuous recording of SCADA data

1415	Chief Joseph Dynamic Brake Test 2 (Tentative)
1420	PDCI Mid-Level Probing Signal Test sequence
	 (Four 2-minute tests), Tentative
1440	Finish test

Each control area is requested to complete the Frequency Responsive
Reserve Survey
form for each of the two generator tripping tests.  Refer to the
instructions in
the April 16, 2001 letter e-mailed to the WSCC Area coordinators.
