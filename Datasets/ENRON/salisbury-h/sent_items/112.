We had a very strange cut today starting HE 1-6. Tag # 016370L where the gen is EPE- E-CISO-PACE   happened to be a cancelled tag and none of the counterparties including us did not know anything. After spending hours on the phone with CISO and PAC John @ PACE found that this tag had been replaced by tag 16381N   but none knew anything about it. This tag was for 78 MW and it was done by a PACE prescheduler.  We were trying to find a new sink in the meantime so before this new tag was found the following went RT

HE 01 78 MW to APS  (APS took the power)
HE 02 sank with LADWP @ $0. I agreed with John at PACE that we are going to charge PAC for HE 1-2 LDs
Then for HE 3-6  the power was sent to PACE for the original deal price at PV.

John at PACE was going to leave good notes to his prescheduler about this cut. I did not do anything HA to manage the cut (in enpower, Lotus notes ) as JOhn at PACE did not consider this a HA cut but a DA cut that nobody knew about. We left it up to the preschedulers to agree on this cut.

if you have questions ask me,
Monika
