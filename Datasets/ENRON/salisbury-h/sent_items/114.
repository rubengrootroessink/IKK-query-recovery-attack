Hello,

I need one ticket to Las Vegas leaving on Friday 4/20 and returning Sunday 4/22.  I have a ticket reserved through my travel agent leaving Portland at 4:20pm and returning on Sunday at 12:30pm.  I reserved this yesterday as the spaces seemed to be filling up.  The price on this is $550 round trip.  My only need is to be back Sunday on an early flight.  I can hold this ticket for a few days.  Let me know if you can do better on the price and I will cancel the reservation.  If not let me know and I will book it.

Thanks,
Holden
