You might ask Sean or Diana.  See what they think.. I know of the schedulers  Dave and Bonnie, but I don't think they will be much help.

The deal was done between Mark and Janice at SRP.  I heard him make the call.  Also, do you have any more avenues with PAC tranny like a supervisor or something.  I am not really in a position to negotiate with anyone.  They all claim that they can't change the Oasis system.
