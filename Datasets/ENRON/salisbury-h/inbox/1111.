Hi Lynn,

According to my records, I do not see where we used  our WAPA transmission on May 12th or May 20th.

I do see purchases from WAPA at Midway on those days, but losses are not billable to Enron on those purchases as the energy was purchased at Midway.

My tags are as follows:

May 12th. Day total of 370,  tag 22299

May 20th,  Day total of 55,  Tag # 22803

If your records indicate that we used WAPA transmission on our own account for those days, please provide me the OASIS number that was assigned to this transmission.

Thank you

Subject:	Enron Losses Due WACM for May 2001

Attached please find an Excel spreadsheet depicting the losses Enron owed WACM, and amounts deficit for May 2001.

The one spreadsheet contains day to day transactions "EnronMay2001.xls" and the other "EnronMaybilldetail.xls" contains calculations of the shortages, with the amount billable being depicted, $6,295.97.

Please feel free to call me if you have questions or concerns or have tag information that may alleviate some of these charges.

This will appear on the May bill to be issued within the next week or so.  Thank you.
