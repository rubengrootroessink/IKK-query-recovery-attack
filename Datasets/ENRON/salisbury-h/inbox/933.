NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

EES Europe Lands First Outsourcing Deal
Congratulations to EES Europe who recently clinched their first outsourcing=
 transaction with supermarket giant, Sainsbury's.  The deal means EES will =
provide gas and electricity to all 493 Sainsbury's properties in the UK inc=
luding stores, offices and depots. EES will also manage a program of energy=
 reduction measures designed to improve energy efficiency at Sainsbury's fa=
cilities.

Stuart Rexrode, Vice President of EES Europe, said: "This was a sensational=
 team effort - a fantastic achievement for EES Europe and a truly groundbre=
aking transaction in the marketplace.  The whole group should all be extrem=
ely proud and I am confident that this is the start of many more outsourcin=
g deals to come."

EBS Europe
EBS Europe has just completed its 100th transaction. The transaction involv=
es a 12-month contract for an STM-4 circuit from London to Madrid. This cap=
acity is equivalent to approximately 830 DSL lines or Internet connections =
into the home.  Commenting on the achievement, Matthew Scrimshaw, President=
 of EBS Europe said, "This is just one of the many milestones that EBS will=
 achieve, as we continue to create a market for bandwidth trading and origi=
nation."

Pioneering International Coal Agreements Signed
Enron has signed a five-year agreement with Spanish utility HidroElectrica =
del Cantabrico for the import of at least 600,000 tonnes of steam coal per =
annum in Enron's first long-term coal import deal into Spain.  The agreemen=
t gives Enron full optionality with regard to sourcing, timing and quantity=
 of coal supply, which will be delivered via the port of Gijon in northern =
Spain and transported by rail and truck to a number of coal-fired power sta=
tions, predominantly in the north of the country.  Gijon itself could becom=
e a trading hub for Spain's rapidly expanding coal market. "Spain is experi=
encing strong demand growth for electricity generation and with an annual p=
roduction of only 17 million tonnes of expensive, low-quality coal at its d=
isposal, the country has a need for new, flexible sources of supply - so th=
ere's lots of opportunity for us to extend the scope of our agreement," say=
s Sam Grossman, Enron's coal group director who led the team which included=
 Katrina Bensadon and Janet Wood with support from the coal and freight tea=
ms.

In a separate agreement Enron's first foray into the US coal import market =
is delivering a cargo of Colombian coal to Dynergy via the Mississippi and =
two further cargoes of 45,000-60,000 tonnes to northeastern US utilities vi=
a Charleston, south Carolina.  With coal supplying the fuel for more than h=
alf of the USA's power generation and the domestic coal market showing high=
 prices - the Nymex coal price has doubled over the past year - this is an =
excellent time for Enron to help meet customer demand.  "This is a classic =
Enron deal exploiting optionality," says Sam Grossman.  "We were able to re=
direct one of our coal cargoes bound for Europe and find an alternative sou=
rce to fulfill the European order."  The import agreement is expected to en=
courage other counterparties into the US coal import market.  Congratulatio=
ns to Sam, Peter Bradley, Lenny Hochschild and the Enron freight desk.
