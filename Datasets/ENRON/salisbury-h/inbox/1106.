AT noon o'clock PST I will need to ask that everyone please get out of CAPS 97 for routine maintenance. The historical and settlement databases will NOT be affected. The purpose for this maintenance will be to help with the locking issue that we have been experiencing lately. Could you let the rest of the people in your department, who will be affected by this, know that they will need to get out of CAPS at noon. Also, if this is going to be a MAJOR problem for anyone, please let me know so that I may be able to try to work out something different.

Thanks,

Michael Tully
