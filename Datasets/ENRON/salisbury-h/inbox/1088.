Group,
Some heads up for this weekend.  For CAPS problems see Mike Tully, his contact info is below.  Also, the generators should have their supps submitted already, but if you decide to sell them real-time be sure to withdraw their supplemental bids.  We are still short at Mead 230.  From HE 1 on Saturday to HE 22 at $50.34 at Mead 230 going to CRC (remember this schedule ends HE 22 on Friday before starting back up HE 1 on Saturday).  Finally, you may have already seen it in Kate's email but BLOOMBERG TRADES ARE FLAT BROKER FEES PER TRADE (WITH NO MW DISTINCTION), PLEASE CLICK OFF THE PER MW TOGGLE NEXT TO THE FEE.

Thanks and call me with any problems.
Bill
