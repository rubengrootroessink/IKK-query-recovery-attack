Happenings for the week of October 22--26

Enron Business

Here is the revised link to Enron Business, which is on desktops now at http://home.enron.com/pubs/enronbiz/2001/vol4/index.htm and coming soon by mail.  If you live in the U.S., you'll find it in your mailbox at home and if you're outside the U.S., it should be coming to your office.

In this issue:
?	Get to know Greg Whalley and Mark Frevert a little better
?	Our internal communications survey results -- what you told us and what we're going to do
?	How employees around the nation responded to Sept. 11
?	The Analyst/Associate program -- holding some of Enron's future stars
?	Crude -- more than just a drop in the barrel
?	The Insider -- what is bid week and how does it work?
?	Extreme Enron -- martial artist, orchid chaser, hydroplane racer, ultramarathoner and more
