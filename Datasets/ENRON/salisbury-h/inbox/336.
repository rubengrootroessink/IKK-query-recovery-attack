Not too much has changed - the models are sure having a tough time resolving this split flow thing and its giving me headaches. So far, things are going according to plan. I feel confident that we will not see a major surge into the river basins but I continue with the idea that snow melt will occur along with somewhat higher snow levels and warmer rains in the Northwest.
