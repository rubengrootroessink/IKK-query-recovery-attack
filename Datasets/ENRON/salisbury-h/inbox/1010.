Holden--

I forgot that Amy will be out of the office next week until Friday. Can I schedule you for sometime in the afternoon this week, or on Friday of next week? Let me know. Sorry for the miscommunication.

Thanks,
Grace

Early next week in the afternoon would work best for me.

Thanks,

Hello all,

Amy would like to meet with each of you individually for about 45 minutes to assess your HR needs. Her schedule is fairly flexible; however, I would like to go ahead and get things set for either later this week, or early next week.

Please let me know what day and time you will be available to meet with Amy.

Thanks!
Grace
