The following message is from the World Trade Center Leasing office.  Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

This is to advise you that the World Trade Center is presently having water testing done by the City of Portland. These tests are causing mineral sediments to come through the pipes. There is no cause for alarm, and thank you for all the calls. The water is not pleasant to look at, yet it is drinkable, the tests show the water to be very safe. Hopefully by Tuesday morning, if not earlier, the water should be back to normal. For those of you who wish to have clear water to drink, please feel free to come to suite #250 where we have filtered water available. 	
This is something that is done once a year and is out of our control. Thank you for being patient.
