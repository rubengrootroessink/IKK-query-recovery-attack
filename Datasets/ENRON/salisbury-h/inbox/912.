Do you know that Enron is committed to providing procurement opportunities to minority and women-owned business enterprises?  Do you know how it works?  Ask Calvin Eakins, director of Minority & Women Business Development about his group's goals for 2001.  Tuesday, July 10 on eSpeak at 10 a.m. Houston time.

Can't make the live event?  No worries.  Go to eSpeak (http://ethink.enron.com/eSpeak/exec/default.asp) now and submit your question.  Calvin will try to answer it during his event and you can read the transcript later.


How do you feel about Enron's cost savings initiatives? Have you thought of some innovative ways to save money?  Talk amongst yourselves in eMeet  http://nahou-lnapp01.corp.enron.com/eThink/eMeet.nsf .
