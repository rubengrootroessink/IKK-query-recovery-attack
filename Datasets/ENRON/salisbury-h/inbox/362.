BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Japan
Enron Japan Closes Its First Yen Based Dubai Crude Oil Swap (11 Oct)
This groundbreaking deal involved Enron Japan purchasing 12,500 barrels of =
Yen-priced March Dubai swaps from Japanese trading house, Kobayashi Yoko. E=
nron Japan purchased the Dubai swaps (Dubai being the marker crude oil in t=
he Asian region) in US$ from Enron Singapore and hedged out the FX risk int=
ernally, offering the customer a yen-based product which best suited its re=
quirements.

This deal highlights the large and (as yet) untapped demand amongst Japanes=
e trading houses and end users for oil risk management products. During the=
 5 months since Enron Japan started its crude and product marketing activit=
ies, it has developed relationships with numerous customers that are lookin=
g to hedge on the basis of both international and domestic indicies (such a=
s the "Japan Crude Cocktail"). Enron Japan is moving very quickly to develo=
p the kind of products that customers need by utilizing the whole suite of =

IN THE NEWS

In these challenging times, Enron deserves our thanks=20
Houston Chronicle, October 28, 2001  By BILL WHITE=20
Enron and its employees have blessed Houston, and many Houstonians should n=
ow take the time to say "thanks" when the company has experienced some high=
ly publicized challenges. Enron attracted thousands of great people to Hous=
ton and changed Houston's economy forever. The company's management encoura=
ged their employees to be active citizens, and those folks responded by mak=
ing a big difference in their community.=20

Enron's lead in shaping a nationwide market for electricity gave birth to a=
 multibillion-dollar new industry, with Houston as its hub. Even while it c=
ompeted hard to win in the marketplace, Enron's example helped show other n=
atural gas pipeline and trading firms how to move into the even bigger mark=
et of electricity

This explosive growth attracted bright young people -- and they in turn hel=
ped fuel an explosion in residential growth in Houston's downtown. This, in=
 turn, helped revitalize downtown's retail and restaurant scene. Enron's co=
nstruction of a large Class A office tower, still going up, is a milestone =
in Houston's growth, an official end to more than a decade of large amounts=
 of vacant office space.=20

Enron's corporate success reflects the stories of so many of its employees =
who have lived the American dream. Enron rewarded innovation, while many fi=
rms afraid to alter the old formula wondered why their leadership eroded. Y=
ear after year, top executives throughout the country voted Enron our natio=
n's most innovative corporation. Enron recognized, even when financial mark=
ets do not, that innovative firms are secure enough to accept occasional fa=
ilure and the inevitable price of other successes.=20

And so if Enron experiences problems, it will learn from them, just as stro=
ng people do. Let's not prejudge Enron's current challenges. The more than =
a decade of my life that was dedicated to trying cases against companies wh=
o hurt consumers and investors taught me both to insist on the truth but ne=
ver to jump to premature conclusions based on a headline or a news story.=
=20
Throughout its years of success, Enron folks have never forgotten to find s=
o many ways to make the firm's hometown of Houston a better place to live a=
nd work. As Enron enters a new phase of its life, let's not forget to expre=
ss thanks and steady support.=20

NUGGETS & NOTES

Portland Bikes to Work
In September, the Portland Office participated in the 2001 OREGON BIKE COMM=
UTE CHALLENGE sponsored by the Bicycle Transportation Alliance (BTA).  BTA =
is a non-profit organization working to promote bicycle use and to improve =
bicycling conditions throughout the state of Oregon. More than 185 business=
es and public agencies across the state and SW Washington registered for th=
e competition to see which among them could tally the most bike commutes ov=
er the course of the month.  Within our category of companies (100-400 empl=
oyees), Enron came in first place with a total of 21% office ridership.  Th=
is was a terrific turnout (second place was under 13% ridership).  The Enro=
n participants had a blast - we broke into teams to challenge each other wi=
th total miles and total trips.  A website was created for our teams to tra=
ck the number of trips and watch the competition.  Overall, Enron participa=
nts completed 1113 commutes for a total distance of 4645 miles, saving 258 =
gallons of gasoline.  Bicycling Magazine recently named Portland "Best Bicy=
cling City in North America".  Many thanks to Heather Dunton for leading En=
ron's participation.
