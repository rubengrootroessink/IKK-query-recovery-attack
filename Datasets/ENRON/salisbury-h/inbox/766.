I would like to talk to you about the Rockies, and just how you see it progressing.  I need to do some workload mitigation stuff, and wanted to pick your brain this afternoon if I can.

I am starting Susie taking care of Midway as of tomorrow, and am thinking about moving the Mead responsiblities to the COB scheduler because COB is so small.
