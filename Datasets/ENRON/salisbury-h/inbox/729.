I don't think I can help you with this until the litigation stuff is over.

It seems that PNM is charging an unreasonable amount for losses.  Is there any way we could address this.

Thanks,
Holden

Guys-

   FYI  --  Public Service Company of New Mexico charges ancillary as follows:

  Schedule 1    Scheduling, System Control, and Dispatch Services -  $0.047 per MWh
  Schedule 2    Reactive Supply and Voltage Control - $0.066 per MWh
  Schedule 9    Loss Compensation Service - $3.00 per MWh.  This $3 is based on a $100 market price x 3%.  I have disputed this charge, arguing that the market (and as you mentioned the Cap) is well below $100.00.  I should be hearing from them soon and I will let you know when I do.  That could bring down  your total ancillary cost from July 2001 going forward.
  New Mexico Gross Receipts Tax - 5.75% of gross charges for the month.  This taxes applied to all schedules that remain within New Mexico. )For   example from Four Corners to San Juan).


Attached is a spreadsheet outlining this month's charges as of today (not accounting for any changes that may come in response to my dispute).

Let me know if you have any questions.

Virginia
