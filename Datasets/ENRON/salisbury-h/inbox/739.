Hi Guys -

  Here is a revised version of that charge split between the ST-SW and ST-WROCKIES books:

     

   FYI  --  Public Service Company of New Mexico charges ancillary as follows:

  Schedule 1    Scheduling, System Control, and Dispatch Services -  $0.047 per MWh
  Schedule 2    Reactive Supply and Voltage Control - $0.066 per MWh
  Schedule 9    Loss Compensation Service - $3.00 per MWh.  This $3 is based on a $100 market price x 3%.  I have disputed this charge, arguing that the market (and as you mentioned the Cap) is well below $100.00.  I should be hearing from them soon and I will let you know when I do.  That could bring down  your total ancillary cost from July 2001 going forward.
  New Mexico Gross Receipts Tax - 5.75% of gross charges for the month.  This taxes applied to all schedules that remain within New Mexico. )For   example from Four Corners to San Juan).


Attached is a spreadsheet outlining this month's charges as of today (not accounting for any changes that may come in response to my dispute).

Let me know if you have any questions.

Virginia
