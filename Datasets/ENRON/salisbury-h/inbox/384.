Subject:	USW/Luscar strike update

A memorandum of agreement has been reached between the USW and Luscar.  A
ratification vote is likely to occur over the weekend although the USW are
in control of that aspect and they face logistical challenges  in
conducting the vote.  If the vote were to occur, and if the it resulted in
ratification it is anticipated workers would be on the job by Tuesday with
it taking several more days to restore normal operations.

I will provide another update if I receive word of the outcome of the vote
before Monday (which I may not as, again it is the USW that are in control
of this).

Regards,
Jim
