The outage will continue through the weekend for the 17.91 MW on the steam turbine.  I filed an outage report with the ISO for this period although the ISO has not returned it.

Group,

Per my earlier email, there has been one change.  Harbor's second unit (HRBGN_7_PL2X3), 17mw, will be down for maintenance on July 4th.  I have submitted an outage report to the ISO.

So, no action is required for this unit on 7/4.  The gas turbine, HRBGN_7_UNITS, 80mw, is still available.

Thanks,
Stan
