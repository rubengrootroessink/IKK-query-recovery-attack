Tomorrow night at 5:30 the Exchange Mail Server will be taken down for upgrading and standardization. From 5:30 to about 8:30 our mail system will be down.

I have had the two realtime traders working tomorrow night migrated to a Houston server so that they will continue to be able to send and receive email during the outage.

If anyone absolutely needs email during the outage, please let me know as soon as possible.

Regards,
Paul Kane
