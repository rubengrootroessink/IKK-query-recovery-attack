With the departure of Greg Wolfe and Holli Krebs, it is necessary to reestablish responsibilities to assure our continued success.  To this end:

Chris Foster will assume responsibility for the Services Desk in addition to retaining overall responsibility for the Middle Market Coverage Group.  Although he will continue to provide leadership to John, Paul and Stewart in managing the Middle Market Coverage effort, Chris will focus his day-to-day efforts on our Services business.  

John Malowney, Paul Choi and Stewart Rosman will be taking a greater leadership role within the Coverage Group.  Within this coverage group, John Malowney will assume a leadership role for Industrials throughout the WSCC, Stewart Rosman will assume responsibility for public utilities, IOUs and public/federal utilities in the Northwest and Northern California and Paul Choi will cover these same sectors in the Southwest and Southern California.  Although each of these individuals will take the lead in assuring coverage for their market segment, it will be done on a collaborative basis to take advantage of individual relationships and talents and to make sure there is back-up if someone is out of the office.  Additional personnel will be hired in the Middle Market Coverage Group within the next month.  Job postings will be made shortly.

Bill Williams will continue to manage the Real Time Group and will now report to Tim Belden.

Lisa Gang will move into the Services Group to help manage our scheduling agreement with El Paso and provide support for other services arrangements.  This will be effective September 10.  Lisa Gang, Les Rawson, and Stan Cocke will report to Chris Foster and endeavor to expand our already successful Services business.
 
While we will miss Holli and Greg personally, I have complete confidence that the new energy and fresh ideas that their departure brings will assure our market leader position will not compromised.
