Just a reminder that Bloomberg will be hosting a free energy seminar this
Wednesday (7/11) at 1:30 pm at the Heathman Hotel in downtown Portland.  To see
a description of what will be covered as well as to sign up to secure your
spot, go to BU <GO> on your Bloomberg.  Select #2 (Events and Seminars in your
Region).  Choose Portland.  The energy seminar is the only menu option.  If you
have any questions feel free to contact me at 415-912-2978.  This should be a
very informative session that will discuss different aspects of Bloomberg's
energy product.  Kristin Hordyke
