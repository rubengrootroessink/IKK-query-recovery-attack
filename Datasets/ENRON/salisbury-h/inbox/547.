Hello Everyone,

	On Tuesday, Oct 2nd, a trainer from Reuters will be here to train us on the new Reuters Kobra application. This application will replace Telerate so it is pretty important to attend this training so that you can pull in the market data that you need.

	Here is how I've setup the schedule.  On Tuesday morning, around 9:30 the non-trading folks (Maria, Jeff R., Julie, Kourtney, Tim H, and Jeff Oh) will attend a class that should only take about one hour. After that, the trainer will spend time at each of your work stations giving you some personal instruction and answering any questions.

	On Tuesday afternoon, around 2:30, the trading folks (Mike Swerzbin, Tom Alonso, Mike Driscoll, Matt Motley, Mark Fischer, Bob Badeer, and Tim Belden) will attend the class. Again, this should only take about an hour.  After that, the trainer will spend time at each of your work stations giving you some personal instruction and answering any questions.

If you have any questions, please feel free to call me or come by my desk.

Regards,
Paul Kane
Portland IT
