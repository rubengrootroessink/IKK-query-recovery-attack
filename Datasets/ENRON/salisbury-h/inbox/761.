Agency has deployed 130 engines to fire lines

SACRAMENTO - The Governor's Office of Emergency Services is working
day and night at its headquarters and in the field to rapidly deploy
additional fire crews to the Northern California fire lines.

As of now, OES has dispatched 130 state OES and local government
engines to battle numerous stubborn  blazes including the Emigrant
Gap fire in the Tahoe National Forest near Interstate-80.

At OES Headquarters, resource requests are being managed by the State

Emergency Operations Center and the Inland Region Emergency
Operations Center, which have been activated. Fire & Rescue, Law
Enforcement, Telecommunication, and Operations staff of OES are all
active in this effort at headquarters and in the field.

Emigrant Gap Fire is one of more than seven Northern California fires

being closely monitored by OES. Combined, the fires have burned
approximately 107,000 acres. All fires combined bring the total
OES-coordinated response to 26 fire engine strike teams working
107,000 acres (see chart for participating cities and counties)
alongside other local, federal and state agencies. 

The local and state-owned equipment has been dispatched through
California's Fire and Rescue Mutual Aid System, administered by OES,
to assist the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection,
and federal wildland fire agencies, and local departments.  The
system is designed to ensure that additional resources are provided
to local jurisdictions whenever their own resources are committed or
insufficient for any fire or rescue operation.

Each strike team consists of five fire engines - with three to four
firefighters per engine - and one strike team leader per team. 
	
Four of the seven fires are being battled by local firefighters
called to duty by OES under the Mutual Aid system:
