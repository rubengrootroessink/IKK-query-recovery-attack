Subject:=09Loss Tag Reminder

Transmission Customers:

The Western Area Colorado Missouri control area (WACM) has just implemented=
 a new scheduling package and thought this would be a good time to offer a =
reminder about how loss energy tags for delivery to WACM are to be complete=
d.

1.  Please ensure that "WACM" is the last PSE on the tag.  This is importan=
t as it provides proper credit to the Transmission Customer for losses deli=
vered.
2.  In the 'Comments' field, please put the words "WACM Losses".  If the ta=
gs are for a real-time transaction from the previous week, please indicate =
the date; i.e., "WACM Losses for MM/DD/YY".
3.  Prescheduled transactions require a concurrent tagging of loss energy t=
o WACM.
4.  Real-time transactions require a return of loss energy to be accomplish=
ed same day, next week, same profile.
5.  It is allowable to combine losses due in any day/week/month/season on a=
 single tag if that is easier for you to do so.  WACM calculates the amount=
 of loss energy due from a Transmission Customer per day based on preschedu=
led transaction losses due on Day 0, plus real-time transaction losses due =
from day -7.

We are working with WACM Operations staff to see if, with the new schedulin=
g software implemented, we will be able to accept real-time transaction los=
s energy concurrent with the real-time transaction.  If we are able to effe=
ct that change, it will be posted on OASIS and we will get an e-mail off to=
 you immediately.

In the meantime, if you have any questions, please give me a call or send a=
n e-mail.
