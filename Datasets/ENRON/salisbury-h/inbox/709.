SACRAMENTO - Today, the Governor's Office of Emergency Services
reports that it has pulled together the largest contingent of
firefighting resources in California history since the Malibu fires
of 1993.

State OES has deployed firefighters from within 51 of California's 58

counties to battle this month's wildfires (see attachment). The 1,500

firefighters make up the second largest mass of firefighters deployed

by OES to a single incident since the Southern California Fire Siege
of October 1993. That month, OES called out 810 engines to battle
193,814 acres. This month, OES has called out 368 engines to battle
more than 100,000 acres.

State OES pulls together local government and state fire fighting
resources through the California Fire & Rescue Mutual Aid System. The

neighbor-helping-neighbor system is designed to assist the California

Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, federal wildland fire
agencies, and local departments. It is also designed to ensure that
additional resources are provided to local jurisdictions whenever
their resources are committed or insufficient for a fire.

Today, 160 fire fighters that OES dispatched to the Ponderosa Fire in

Placer County are returning to their homes in El Dorado, Contra
Costa, Nevada, Placer, Sacramento, Yolo and Solano Counties.

In all, 368 local government and State OES engines deployed by OES
remain on four fires along with eight California National Guard
helicopters. Those fires are:

?Creek Fire in Mariposa and Tuolumne counties at 11,565 acres, 60%
contained with 211 OES and local government engines. Since the fire
started 5 p.m. on Saturday it has threatened 3,000 homes.

?North Fork in Madera County at 2,710 acres, 10% contained with 10
local government engines. Since that fire started on Monday, it has
destroyed two homes, and led to evacuation orders on 210 homes.

?Highway Fire in Fresno County (Sequoia National Forest), which is
1,275 acres, 0% contained, today, with 15 OES and local engines.
Since the fire started at 6:45 p.m. on Sunday, it has destroyed three

homes, and four out buildings. 

?Leonard Fire in Calaveras County, is 3,800 acres, 30 % contained,
with 90 OES and local engines. Since the fire started at 2:15 p.m. on

Friday, three structures have been destroyed: 1 home and two
outbuildings. Evacuations have been ordered for numerous communities.



The OES Fire and Rescue Emergency Operations Center in Sacramento
remains activated 24-hours a day to provide statewide coordination of

fire and rescue efforts. Representatives from OES Executive, Law
Enforcement, Inland Region and California Department of Forestry and
Fire Protection are co-located in the Fire EOC.
