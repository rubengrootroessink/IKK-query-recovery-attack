Deadline extended through Tuesday, Sept. 25 for disaster relief donations.  So far we have $2049 ($6147 w/Enron match!).

Thanks for your support!




In an effort to support our fellow citizens during this time of disaster we will be collecting donations for relief efforts in NY, DC and PA.
A designated collection box has been placed by the lobby area.  All donations will be double matched by Enron.

If we all donated what we have would spent on the complimentary lunch today or what we would spend on coffee tomorrow, matched double by Enron, it would really add up.  The money will be sent on Monday, September 24.

The funds will be donated to the following organizations, please pay by cash or check payable to an organization listed below or a relief organization of your choice.  We will take care of the appropriate matching donation forms.
