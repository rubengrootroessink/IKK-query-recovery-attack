Holden,

I created a new user for you so that you can gain access to the Traffic
Report.

Your username is holden and your password is fried

I believe that there is an agreement screen which you have to sign off on
the first time you log in.  After you log in successfully, you can change
your password.

Feel free to call with any questions or concerns.
