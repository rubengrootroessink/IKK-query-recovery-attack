Heather,

  Do you know :
  If there are 3 strips in a deal that cover different time periods, say April 1 for a strip, April 2 for another strip, and April 3 - 31 for a third strip....if we plug in a price on only one of the strips, are the days from the other strips going to get valued properly?  

 In the instances that we have had, all three strips were filled in and Risk valued the deal properly; it was just CARP and UNIFY that were reading three times the MW Month amount, which I guess in the end is a simple problem.

 Holden brought up this point and I wonder the same...do you know?

  Virginia
