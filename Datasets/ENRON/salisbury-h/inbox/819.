An old scam has surfaced recently with renewed vigor.  The Nigerian-419 fraud letter, so called because it violates section 419 of Nigerian law, is sent in many variations, by surface and airmail as well as by fax and email.  Generally the form it takes is to ask the unsuspecting victim to provide their bank account information in return for a promise to deposit a very large sum of money into that account under some pretext.

Employees should be advised that any information given will be used to further promote the scam through the emptying out of bank accounts, counterfeit and forged checks being written against the accounts, and for other illegal purposes.

If you receive what you believe to be one of these letters, forward it to Mike Hicks (Michael.Hicks@enron.com).  Corporate Security maintains a file on them, and works with the US Secret Service to reduce the number of letters received by our employees.

For more information on these letters, please email or call Mike at (713) 853-6198.
