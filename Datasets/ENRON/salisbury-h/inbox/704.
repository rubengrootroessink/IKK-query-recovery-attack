Please be aware that the last leg of transmission listed on tag #28010 is a dummy leg of transmission that needs to be placed on the tag in order to reflect Valley Electrics Load at Mead 230.  We use this dummy leg of transmission because Valley Electric does not have a PSE acronym in the OATI tagging system.  We have been creating tags such as this since the OATI tagging system has been in use and have not or should not be getting charged for using NEVP trani.  Please refer to the following tag numbers as examples:  22655, 22654, 26279, 26387.  Please note that each of these tags was approved by NEVP the control area and NEVP the transmission provider and therefore has been implemented.   It was our understanding that this was a practice agreed upon by NEVP and Enron in order to reflect Valley Electrics load at Mead.   My contact at Nevp is Jannella Battles.   Please, keep me in the loop as to what the result of this issue will be.

Thanks,
