Hi,

I want to let you know about a QuickBase database called "Pool Information Guide".  You can get there by clicking this link:

 https://www.quickbase.com/db/6545ewmy?a=i&pswd=dynicdfpr

Here's a quick description of the database:

"WELCOME to the "Pool Information Guide" and thank you for taking the time to register!  Please click "ADD RECORD" to fill in the template with your information.

This on-line database was designed to help all of us stay in touch this summer at Enron and beyond (and to save us from having to keep forwarding and updating spreadsheets).  Feel free to update your record and/or download the database as often as you like.  Please encourage your peers to register with the site so that we may all benefit from having one central reference point.

You can use this site to locate someone's desk, to find out who is working on projects of interest to you, to get the word out about your interests beyond your assigned project, to round up folks to discover Houston with, to see who is celebrating a birthday, or to plan a carpool or shared commute to the office.

You will notice that there are several required fields - these fields will be used by HR for their "book."  All Summer Associates & Analysts will receive a copy of this book, which will also contain our pictures.

Enjoy!
    John Walt

(Please direct technical questions to Laura Ann Jones at 3-1413 or laura.jones@enron.com)

Instructions in Short:
______________________

To ADD YOUR CONTACT INFORMATION:  Click on "Add Record" and fill in the template.

To PERUSE the database:  Click on "List"

To EDIT your record:  Click on "List" then "Edit"

To DOWNLOAD the database into Excel:  Click on "List" then "Spreadsheet".

To PRINT the database:  I highly recommend downloading the database and then printing as usual from Excel.  Printing from the web page only gives you part of the whole spreadsheet.

To SORT the database:  Click on one of the pre-defined "Views" to the left.  Email me if you want to sort by something new.

ps.  The reason we need to keep our attached pictures 10k or less is QuickBase is only free for databases less than a meg in size.

pps.  Please keep in mind that if you lose your password or want to invite other people to join the Pool Information Guide - just send me an email and I can help.  <laura.jones@enron.com>"

By the way, going to the link above will automatically add you (or anyone else) to the access list for this database, so be careful to whom you forward this e-mail! (This link will expire in 30 days.)

If you're not already a QuickBase user click this link anyway.  At the sign-in screen click the Register link.  When you're all done registering, QuickBase will bring you right to this database!
