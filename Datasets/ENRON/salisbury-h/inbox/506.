Leslie,
 
Holden just informed me that he wants to use Pinnacle without any reference to 250 or 500 kV.
 
Thanks,

I'm still waiting on Holden Salisbury to look into this product a bit more -- he's confirming that they really want the Pinnacle 500 kV.

Leslie, 

Have you had a chance to look into the other location requested by West Power, Pinnacle Peak.
