Melissa:

As per our conversation, please create 2 new delivery points in EnPower -- West Wing 500 kV and West Wing 230 kV.  When these have been created, please deactivate the current West Wing delivery point.

Please let me know when this has been done so that I can create the new EnronOnline delivery point requested by the West desk.  Give me a call if you have any questions or comments.

Leslie
