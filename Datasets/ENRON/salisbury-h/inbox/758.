Tom/Mark,

Thanks for taking the time to review the introduction.  The purpose of the document will be for all parties in the west (TO's and participants) to discuss and address commercial seams which, if left unchecked, could develop with the implementation of RTO West and DSTAR.  The introduction is intended to be a summary of the needs of the market and discuss the development of good base-business practices west region-wide that the RTO's can use to implement common methodologies.

Kind Regards,

Dave
