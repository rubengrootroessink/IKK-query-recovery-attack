Change is inevitable (especially at Enron)!  Although the announcement of Jeff Skilling's resignation is a surprise and generally sad news, it is important to remember that our business here in Portland will not be affected by Jeff's departure.  Likewise, the leadership of Enron Americas and the broader Enron Wholesale Services management team remains unchanged by this announcement.  In summary, business as usual!
