If your TERMINAL SERVER H: drive is located in Houston, Please let me know ASAP. You will know if it is by signing on to a terminal Server session and then double clicking on My Computer and then select the H: Drive. If it says anything like nahou then you are located in Houston. If it says napdx then you are located in Portland. The only ones I need to know about is if you are located in Houston. Thank you for your time.
