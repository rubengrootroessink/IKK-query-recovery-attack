For Short Term this is how the Sunday price works:

Sunday Peak price should be marked as is - we will value at whatever you mark for Peak.
6x8+24 price is not affected by the Peak price (only LT because it looks at what the Sunday price is marked @).

For Short Term - Portcalc (calculation system) will take your Sunday deal and value like a Peak day.
ie HE 1-24, portcalc will take your Sunday offpeak price for HE1-6,23-24 & your peak price for HE7-22.
So mark the price as you want it valued.

Portcalc uses 75% of peak for Long Term only.

They are looking into the Sunday scalars option..... I will keep you updated on that.

Arun what do you think about giving them the option to mark Sunday Scalars?

Arun could you help me decipher the proper way to mark Sunday.

I am working w/ the STSW desk on this.
Does Portcalc use 75% of what they mark for the Sunday (in the ON PEAK column)?
If so should Holden be marking that Sunday price a little higher if it will be valued at 75% of what he marks?
How is the Off-Peak (6x8+24 - since this is the short-term desk) price affected by how he marks Sunday Peak?

Thanks for your help,
Heather
