Subject: Server Outage In PDX
Importance: Low


We just experienced an outage of around 7 servers for 1.5 minutes.
 
Cause:
 
One of our master network switches crashed and rebooted itself making the device attached to them unavailable.
 
The Servers themselves did not crash, just there connection to the network.
 
The Network Team is looking into why this happened.
