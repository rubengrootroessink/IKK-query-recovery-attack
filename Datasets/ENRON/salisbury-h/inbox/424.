The current status is:

   As indicated previously there are many variables that prevent TransAlta
   from being able to predict how long we can maintain current output
   levels but we will advise in advance if changes from current operation
   are anticipated.  Coal blending impacts have resulted in some derates.
   The risk of disruption of coal supply or unit problems as a result of
   degraded fuel quality remains high.

   As with any labour disruption the situation could change quickly.

Regards,
Jim
