Dear QuickBase Customer:

We want to let you know of a great opportunity that will take your use of QuickBase, the Web-based service for managing, organizing, and sharing information, to the next level!

Beginning November 9, 2001, you can create a single database, up to 10 KB in size, attach up to 500 KB in files and program QuickBase - all at no charge.

How does this impact you?
It's a great opportunity for you to evaluate QuickBase for free and see how easy it is to share information. Create your database from scratch or choose one of our samples for common business applications. Or, maybe you have a spreadsheet you want to share. Simply import or paste into QuickBase.

Can you create even more databases? 
Yes, you can. If you're impressed with QuickBase, sign up <https://www.quickbase.com/db/main?a=realmmain&realmid=47207&promo=1&s=8> for one of three monthly service plans. Be sure to sign in using your QuickBase username, Holden, and password.

On these plans, starting at $14.95/month, you can create multiple databases with expanded capacity to meet your growing business needs. You can also have better control of database user access rights, receive expert support via e-mail, and program QuickBase. Review our Service Plan Highlights below to choose the plan that best fits your needs.

As a special offer for our existing Starter Plan customers, your first month of service is free when you sign up <https://www.quickbase.com/db/main?a=realmmain&realmid=47207&promo=1&s=8> by November 9, 2001.*

Once again, QuickBase is a great way to manage, organize and share information. Create a QuickBase database, and you'll see why!

Regards,
Jill Ward
General Manager
Intuit QuickBase
