Thanks,

I submitted the wire for the $757,200 payable to PNM.  Just keep me posted
if you need anything additional to supply the remaining Pinnacle Peak.  I am
glad to hear that APS is giving us transmission.  I was afraid they would
cut us because of the late $43k.

Steve

We have a receipt from CRC at Mead to fulfill the other 25mw's.  Also we
have a light load receipt at Four Corners from EPE that we are wheeling on
APS transmission to fulfill the light load at Pinnacle Peak.

Your table shows a short of 25 RTC (vice HLH) at Pinnacle Peak.  In
addition, we are only buying 25 HLHat Mead 230, but have a short of 50 HLH??

This is everything for PNM.  We still need to buy 25mw heavy load at
Pinnacle Peak.  PNM did everything else.  I will send you a complete email
as soon as we procure the last piece.

Thank you,
Holden
