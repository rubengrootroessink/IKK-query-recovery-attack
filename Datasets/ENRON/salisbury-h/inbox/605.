Please join me in welcoming Julie Kearney to the Human Resources department in Portland.  Julie has been working as a Manager in Human Resources for EBS since April of 1999.  Prior to joining EBS, Julie was a Recruiting Manager for Triad Technology Group.

Julie and I will be working together over the next week to ensure a smooth transition.  If you need to reach either me or Julie, please call x7404 or stop by and say hi.

Thanks -
Amy
