As much as I'd like to, I can't get to every floor or to every location across Enron to talk with you about what is going on around the company.  So I'm doing the next best thing.  Beginning today, you can access a videotaped message from me about our second quarter results and our new strategy concerning Enron Broadband Services.  As you listen, I hope you find the information valuable and this new way of communicating easy and timely.  I plan to do this regularly, so watch your e-mail for future messages.  Thanks for listening and have a great day.
