Please note that there is a new deal entered today to transfer the BOM portion of the UAMPS deal from LT-SW to ST-WR per Matt's request. The deal details are:

Index-Option: 807382.1
Term: 10/8/01 - 10/31/01
(we use the same method to pick the hours as we use for the CSU option)
The MTM value calculated from this deal for ST-WR is $30,685.

For Monday strip:
Index-Forward: 807382.2
Term: 10/8/01 - 10/8/01
HE 11 - 10mws
HE 12-14  -  25mws
per Holden.

The BOM strips for the index-option deal #804470 in LT-SW have been zeroed out.

An annuity deal #807428 was entered for the difference between $2.5 MM (per Matt) and $30,685 = $2,469,315, for LT-SW Buy from ST-WR.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Samantha
