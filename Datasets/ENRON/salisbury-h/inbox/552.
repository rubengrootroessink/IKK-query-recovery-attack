Before I leave today, I just wanted to say what a great experience it has been working in Portland over the last 15 months.  I have learned so much and am amazed at what a motivated and talented team we have.  I will miss all of the friendships I have made and wish everyone the best of luck and success. 

If you are ever in Houston, please give me a ring!

Take care -
Amy
