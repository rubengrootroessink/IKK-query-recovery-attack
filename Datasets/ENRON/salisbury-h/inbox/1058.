Hi Kate,
Melissa Murphy just notified me that there will be a list of about 10 counterparties (we do not have the list yet) to whom we will need to start sending confirmation letters for hourly deals.  That is no problem at all, except that I just pulled up the first two (Chris Foster specifically wanted us to confirm these two today) and they have the wrong energy type.  They should be CAISO energy.  These are deals #640353, and #640338.
I know that the hourly traders are not in the habit of making sure that these energy types are correct, but if we are going to confirm these, they need to make an effort to do so.  Will you please forward this to them and make sure that all of them are aware how important this will be for documentation purposes?
Thanks so much!
Kim
