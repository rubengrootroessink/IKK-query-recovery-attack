Why You Need The Outlook in 2002

If we've learned anything in recent years, it's that cool heads will 
always prevail. That's why The Outlook is your best bet for successful 
investing in 2002. The Outlook did not make a name for itself based 
on a handful of hyper-inflated "good years" - its stellar reputation 
comes from over 75 years of proven investment advice.

You don't stay in the business that long without providing subscribers 
with consistently high returns.

What should you expect from The Outlook? Solid research, unbiased 
investment ideas, candid buy and sell recommendations, easy-to-follow 
charts & graphs, plus unlimited access to The Outlook's complete 5-STARS 
and Platinum portfolios.

Best of all? Total honesty and perspective from an independent investment 
advisor that does not generate commissions through its recommendations. 
The Outlook's sole objective is to build wealth for its subscribers.

Maybe that's why - through good times and bad - The Outlook's top picks 
have consistently outperformed the S&P 500 by nearly 3-to-1.

Special New Year's Offer

Now you can put The Outlook's profitable investment advice to work for 
you in 2002 - starting with 30 RISK-FREE days.

Find out why American investors have made The Outlook their one 
indispensable investment resource for the better part of a century.
