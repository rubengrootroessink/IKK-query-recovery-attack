Good Afternoon Folks

I am sure this will come up in a month or so. 

We bought 20 mw from Mirant at 4 Corners for 9/27 and 9/28.  Mirant cut the schedule for 9/28 because they could not get transmission.  We are accepting this cut. We re-supplied our downstream and no LD's are to be billed per Mark and Holden.

I changed the volume to Zero in scheduling, and wrote a note there.

Lemmie know if there is trouble with this.
