My name is Stuart Wright and I am the Director of Marketing and Sales for F=
riedWire Inc.   I check our use log everyday and throughout the day and not=
ice that you are always among the most intensive users of our Traffic Repor=
t System.  I am very thankful for this and was wondering if you could tell =
me what you do at Enron and (since you are such a great user) if you have i=
deas for enhancing the Traffic Report?  We would value your feedback highly=
. =20
=20
We are building two new tools that you should be aware of.  One is a greatl=
y expanded version of the Traffic Report that will contain the real-time pr=
icing and news from a major provider of this information.  We will be annou=
ncing more on this shortly and plan to deliver the new version in September=
.  Additionally, FriedWire is building a PJM information module similar to =
the California tab now contained in the Traffic Report, which presents regi=
on-specific information; in the case of PJM, mostly the LMP and FTR informa=
tion. Following PJM, we will be developing similar detailed regional module=
s for NY/NE and ERCOT (in order).  A very rough draft of the information co=
ntent in the PJM Module is outlined here in the attached PowerPoint file.  =
Some of the features you see may not be available in the very first release=
, but we'd love to hear your opinion on what features would be most useful.=
   We debated internally over whether or not our first independently releas=
ed PowerSurge product should cover PJM or some other region.  We chose PJM =
despite the fact that the PJM ISO already does a decent job of presenting/s=
haring market information and because PJM is such a liquid trading region a=
mong many of our existing clients.  Our goal, however is to build a product=
 that is so much more powerful than the PJM information interfaces (such as=
 eData) that in selling the product we never get asked the question "why sh=
ould I buy this when I can get eData for free?"  That means a fair bit of w=
ork, but it's also the kind of work that we're good at: charting, geographi=
c displays, interface design, e-mail and wireless paging notification, and =
integrating various data sources.  Some of the areas we think will be valua=
ble and set us apart from eData are
=20
}          Combining real-time and day-ahead LMP data with the public FTR d=
ata to provide a real-time estimate of FTR value
}          Easy interface for querying FTR data for the sake of competitive=
 intelligence in the primary and secondary FTR markets
}          LMP charts and maps
}          Eastern Interconnect frequency monitoring
}          Histogram displays of historical and real-time load and LMP data
}          Mapping of planned and unplanned transmission constraints
=20
FriedWire would be especially interested in knowing Enron's interest in the=
 FTR features.  In fact, if you have a PJM expert that would be willing to =
talk to our lead product developer, we would be grateful.  We know that PJM=
 does very little with their display of the FTR information and we know tha=
t there is a lot of competitive intelligence to be gained from it, but we'r=
e not sure how many traders are interested in FTRs.  Our understanding is t=
hat there's not a lot of liquidity in the FTR markets and therefore, there =
may not be lots of money to be made/saved there.  We also are going back an=
d forth about how to market and sell the PJM data.  Whether we integrate it=
 straight into the Traffic Report or make it the first of a series of regio=
nal intelligence modules in a larger product called "PowerSurge" is current=
ly unknown.  Also, the pricing for the product is not yet determined.
