Please keep in mind when entering NPC transmission into Enpower.  

Beginning July 2001, the ancillary services rate for
Nevada Power has been changed from $0.70 to $0.58539(roughly 59 cents) per
MWh. 

TOTAL = $0.58539 per MWh

Reserved transmission is $1.70 LLoad  $2.90 HVLoad

If the transmission is wheeled the .59 should be added to the reserved price and the amount entered should be:

$2.29  LLoad

$3.49  HVload

The problems I see are deals entered at prices of $4.10, $3.60, or $2.40 or deals have been entered in at the reservation charge even though they the transmission was used.
