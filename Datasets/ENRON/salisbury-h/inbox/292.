If you are unable to login to the Open Enrollment 2002 site online, you have another option:

Please call the Benefits Center directly at 800.332.7979.
Select option "5"
Enter the company number on your benefits worksheet (for most people, it will be 0741--not that same as the SAP company number)
Enter your login (Your SSN, followed by the "#" key)
Enter your password (Last 4 digits of your SSN, followed by the "#" key)
Use your worksheet to make your selections 

Please note: The system will walk you through the steps. It takes a little while, but HAVE PATIENCE--it's faster than waiting to access the system online!

If you have any questions, please stop by my desk -- I will be happy to assist you. 

REMEMBER: You have until 3:00pm to make your elections!

Thanks,
Grace
