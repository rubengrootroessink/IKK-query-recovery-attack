Hi Heather.

I am in SF today but will be back in the Portland office tomorrow (Thursday) morning. I do have two bikes that I can make available. One is a road bike and one is a mountain bike. Both are in good order.

The question will be how to get them to the Portland office from my house in Hillsboro. I'm sure we can work that out Thursday.

Jeff
