The Short Term West Hourly group is responsible for the physical and financial integrity of prescheduled energy transactions. This includes managing curtailed schedules and preserving Enron's financial rights with trading counterparties. The group is required to maintain records and update databases that explain supply or market interruptions in order to minimize customer disputes 

The Hourly group interacts with the Services and Middle Marketing groups to administer terms of Service Desk contracts, which may include the selling of excess generation and/or the purchasing of energy to meet customers' requirements.  Also, each trader is responsible for gathering and reporting information on unit outages, transmission line derations and other information pertaining to all West Desk Trading activity.

The West Hourly EOL Trader will be responsible for helping to lead the transition of hourly trading of energy in the California ISO and bilateral markets to Enron Online.  The trader is expected to initiate profitable trades while managing the company's risk exposure.  The trader is expected to understand all settlements procedures and be familiar with charges related to each type of trade.
