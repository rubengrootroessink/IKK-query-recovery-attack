Holden,

Can you look at this deal, 602737.1.  It's not comming through on the CARP report even after I schedule it and PNM is wondering why. 

 Also, a purchase for $58 27 mw's isn't in the system and they are seeing it.

I'm not sure how Parking and lending deals are entered in the system, but somthing looks out of wack

thanks
