Holden,
Please forward me your credit card number(s) and any relevant frequent traveller information so that we can set up a profile.
Also, I unfortunately needed to book you in two different hotels in Denver. I booked Paul in the Hotel Monaco for two nights, and you in the Monaco for the second night. I have found you another hotel down the street from the Monaco for the first night. I hope that is ok.
Thanks,
Anna
