Please make sure that all of your deals are correctly entered in Deal Entry as confirmation - "no."  There are quite a few coming over to our system as "yes" agreement.  This is a problem because it is very easy to mistakenly send a confimation letter to the counterparty on hourly trades -they always call confused when that happens.  Most of the time, I change these to no confirm, however, there are several everyday now and it really slows us down when volumes are high.  

Thanks so much for your help!
