PSCO Tag # 1020226,

The path:

MPCO@COLS-MPCO(T)COLS/YT-MPC-DUKE-PSCO-MPCO(T)YT/HOTS-PSCO-DUKE-ENRON-SNPD-BPA(T)HOTS/SNOH    for 5 mw flat

The path is stable so far, but there are rumored to be outages pending that may affect this path.

Please call DUKE and SNPD before this path begins (HE 0100 Sunday) to make sure it is ok.

Good Luck!

c
