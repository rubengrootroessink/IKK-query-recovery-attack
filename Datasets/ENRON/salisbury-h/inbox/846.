Please consider hosting the Enron Suite while we help the community!!
 
We have donated our Suite to Metropolitan Family Services on Monday, and need an Enron representative!
 
I have 2 tickets and one parking pass available for the Beavers Game at PGE Park on Monday.
 
Please see me if you are interested.
 
Thank you!
