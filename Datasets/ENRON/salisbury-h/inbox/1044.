In the next few days, 250 randomly selected U.S.-based employees will receive Fortune's "100 Best Companies to Work for in America" survey.  Check your home mailbox.  You could be one of the lucky ones to receive this very important survey.

The input you provide in this survey is the most important element in the evaluation process.  Your honest and open responses, as well as written comments about your personal Enron experiences, will help Fortune gain an insider's viewpoint. 

So look for the survey in your home mailbox.  Thanks for your participation.
