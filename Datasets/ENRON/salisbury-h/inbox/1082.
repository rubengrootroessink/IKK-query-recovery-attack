All, 

This weekend Houston experienced a flood that significantly impacted the IT environment, several Enron Information Technology systems experienced outages.  At this time all critical systems have been restored and should be operational.  

The Portland offices lost their connection to Houston for several hours (as did other Houston based companies due to power failures and Telco carrier failures). The following functionality was lost or severely impacted:

?	Email
?	Internet (CAISO access)
?	Houston file access
?	Houston based market data feeds
?	Tie lines and ring downs to Houston (Complete phone service has not been restored  in Houston and the circuits are very busy.)
?	Terminal Server Clusters, General and Trading. (CAPS, EnPower)

The above services have been restored.

While Houston was in the process of restoring service, several user and common data directories for Houston users and Houston based applications had to be restored from the backup tapes from Thursday evening.  Therefore, some of you may be missing data files on your M or O drives that you created or modified on Friday.  

Please contact me if you encounter any issues or have any questions.

Regards,

	David Steiner
