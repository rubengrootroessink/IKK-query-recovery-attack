Amy-
I show DMS #'s 10444 and 10445.
I'll enter these in the system today, although we do not agree with the loss charge from DMS 10444.  I have been disputing this directly with their transmission department.  We will pay the bill as is so as not to incur any late charges but there is a great possibility that we will need to future-adjust for a $500 credit from them as we are not in agreement with the $ 6120.

Thanks,

 Virginia

Holden, Mark, and Tom-  FYI - I called Don again and he is "out" til Thursday.  I was given the name of John Montoya to contact.  Do you know who he is?
