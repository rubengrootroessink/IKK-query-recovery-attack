This is just to let everyone who is using the New Curve Manager in Enpower:
The Curve Manager is having a problem in Terminal Server 2. (NAHOU-TRDTS2) The problem is currently being diagnosed by both the Enpower Team and Terminal Server Team in Houston. As Soon as it is fixed, I will let everyone know. For now you can use any other terminal server session (i.e. TRDTS1, or TRDTS03 - TRDTS5) for running the Curve Manager.
