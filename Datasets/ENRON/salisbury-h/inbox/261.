The Enpower (Oracle) database is back up, please let me know if you have any further problems. You should NOT have to get out of Enpower to continue working.

The Enpower Database is down. I have been speaking to Houston and they are estimating 20 minutes before it is back up. As soon as it comes back I will let you know.
