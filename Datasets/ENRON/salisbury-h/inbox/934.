Honestly, I don't know - maybe a risk person could better answer.  All I know is we only give DPR in the amount of the variance between what they flashed and what we actualized ( finaled ) - Sorry I can't be of more help - maybe ask Casey Evans - A

Amy,

  For my own information, how does risk flash only ($ 67,580) worth of tranny purchases in April if EnPower was accounting for ($196,200.00) until the end of May?

Virginia - 

In April Risk flashed ($67,580) for WAPA CRSP trans.  You were also given in April , DPR of $3,495.50. This would bring your books to reflect the true/finaled amonut of $64,084.50.  The DMS variance was strictly an accounting variance - we used that to adjust to what we accrued - which was the multiplying incorrectly piece.  So no more DPR - your books should be good for April WAPA CRSP trans.

Let me know if you have any more questions - A
