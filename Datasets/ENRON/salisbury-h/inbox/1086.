IMPORTANT:

PLEASE READ THE ATTACHED FILE ("Ethical Wall Procedure") AND PRINT AND SIGN THE EMPLOYEE CERTIFICATION (below).

For your convenience, I have made copies of the document and the compliance form, which are available at my desk. You are welcome to review the document (3 1/2 pages) and sign one of the certification forms. Signed forms can be placed in the confidential envelope, also at my desk. I will forward them to Donna Lowry next week.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks,
Grace
