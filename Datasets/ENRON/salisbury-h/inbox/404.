Doesn't look like too much change - but this weather pattern is so conducive to precipitation in and West of the Cascades in the Northwest and British Columbia that I needed to up precipitation amounts there. Calfiornia should remain mostly dry and and most of the time mild to warm. Overall no split flow regime seen on the models through 15 days which will benefit western Canada and the northern 2/3 of the watershed areas for a little while until things change again.
