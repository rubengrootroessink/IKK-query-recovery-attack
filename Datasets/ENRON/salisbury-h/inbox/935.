Here is amy's message forwarded.  looks like we actually flashed close to the correct amount. 
this looks like an accounting variance more than a DPR impact.

Virginia - 

In April Risk flashed ($67,580) for WAPA CRSP trans.  You were also given in April , DPR of $3,495.50. This would bring your books to reflect the true/finaled amonut of $64,084.50.  The DMS variance was strictly an accounting variance - we used that to adjust to what we accrued - which was the multiplying incorrectly piece.  So no more DPR - your books should be good for April WAPA CRSP trans.

Let me know if you have any more questions - A
