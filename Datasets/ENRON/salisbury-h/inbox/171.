All,
	
We had a piece computer equipment that has gone missing.

The device is a network hub that looks like the attached picture.

It was hooked up to 3 computers over in the area of HR last night about 4:00 pm and was noticed to be missing about 6:00 am this morning.  If anybody know where it may have gone please let HR or myself know as soon as possible.


Regards 

Dave
