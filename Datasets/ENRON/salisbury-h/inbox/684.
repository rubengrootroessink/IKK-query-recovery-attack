All,

Recently I have taken over as Director of the Volume Management Group.  Wit=
h Murray O'neil and Chris Stokely leaving, as well as other key members, I =
am becoming increasingly aware that the group is not currently providing th=
e value to your desks as it has in the past.  My hope is that over the rema=
inder of this year we can make a concentrated effort to bring the current g=
roup up to speed so that we can restore the level of service provided in th=
e past.  We are currently initiating training both interally and externally=
 to increase the groups understanding level. We are also Implementing new t=
ools that should increse our effectiveness and efficiency.  Additionaly,  I=
 would like to personaly invite your feedback on how indivduals and our gro=
up is performing and progessing during this transition.  Your feedback is c=
ritical to our success and I consider it critical to shaping this new group=
.  I want to know if we are performing the core acitities well,  and if we =
are developing a reputation as experts of how our markets  works as well as=
 providing valuable analysis.  Personally,  I will be introducing myself to=
 you over the next week or two and would like to sit with each of you to ga=
in an appreciation for your roles and how we can play a role in aiding you.=
  as a parting shot Murray has asked most of the team to do the same so don=
't be suprised if you are suddnely enundated with requests to shadow you. I=
 look forward to working with you all.=20

Regards,

Scotty Gilbert
