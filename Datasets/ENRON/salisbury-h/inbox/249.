I regret to inform the Portland office that Tracy Ngo has resigned from her position effective immediately.  Although it will be tough to fill her shoes, Susan Rance (503/464-7086) will be coordinating with the rest of the credit department to help us address credit issues.  Please refer all questions and inquiries regarding credit to Susan.
