Do you want to know more about how Enron gets its messages out to the media?  Ask Karen Denne, vice president of Public Relations, how the media process works.  Tuesday, July 24 on eSpeak at 10 a.m. Houston time.

Can't make the live event?  No worries.  Go to eSpeak (http://ethink.enron.com/eSpeak/exec/default.asp) now and submit your question.  Karen will try to answer it during her event and you can read the transcript later.
