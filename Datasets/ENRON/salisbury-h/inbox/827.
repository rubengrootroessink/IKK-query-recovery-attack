Good Morning,

EPE has agreed to pay a scheduling fee for all MWh we schedule for them and prepare on their sheet.  Greg Wolfe has included language in the contract that all deals we do directly with them need to be adjusted by .25 in our favor for scheduling fees.

Please talk to me if you have any questions about our new EPE scheduling deal, it is going to cause some changes on this side of the row.

C
