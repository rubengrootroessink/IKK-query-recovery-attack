Holden see Scenario III for Demand Charge Frequency per MW/hr

Each strip is calculated.

demand charge per day = # of hours per day * demand charge volume in MW * demand charge price in $

So OffPeak would have 2 strips - one for HE1-6 and one for HE23-24

Does this help?  Let me know what we need to do w/ 707211.
