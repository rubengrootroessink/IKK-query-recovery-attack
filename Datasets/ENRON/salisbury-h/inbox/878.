Do you like golf? 

Do you like kids?

How would you like to put the two together, AND 
earn a free day-pass to the 2001 Fred Meyer Challenge  
at The Reserve Vineyards & Golf Club?

--------------------------------------------------

Metropolitan Family Service (MFS) will be running several fund-raising activities during 
the Fred Meyer Challenge, August 5-7, at The Reserve Vineyards & Golf Club. 
Proceeds will help support MFS programs for children, families, and the elderly.

MFS needs your help! 
Volunteers are needed to help run these fund-raising activities!
Each volunteer shift is three hours in length and includes a lunch ticket, shirt, parking pass 
& credentials (for the volunteer day), as well as an additional day-pass to the Challenge.
At this time, volunteers are needed for Monday & Tuesday (7-10a, 10-1p, 1-3p shifts), 
although some Sunday shifts slots are still available (11-2p, 2-5p).

The duties are simple: 
greet and register participants, 
collect/handle money, 
keep scores, 
distribute prizes, 
and other easy tasks

You can have fun, work with kids, and 
help raise money for a great organization--all at the same time!

Are you interested? 
Please contact Tiffany Dean at MFS (tiffanyd@metfamily.org) or let me know (x8321).

--------------------------------------------------

If you are unable to volunteer but are planning on attending the Challenge, 
please stop by and support the following MFS activities and contests:
Putt for Kids
Kids' Interactive Golf Course
"The Long Drive"
"Chip-On Game"
The events are fun for the whole family!
