John Lavorato confirmed that UBS is indeed the winner.  As I understand it, UBS has come to an agreement with Enron for the purchase of the North America Gas/Power Trading and Marketing organization.  We either have received or are expected to receive approval from the Creditors committee today.  Creditors Committee approval is considered likely as they have been in the loop on this transaction all along.  It will most likely go in front of the judge on Monday.  Approval from the judge is expected.  I have a meeting in the next couple of hour where I will get more details.  Stay tuned ...
