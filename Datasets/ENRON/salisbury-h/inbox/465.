In case you are interested, the results of the Bike Commute Challenge were given last night at the Bike Commute Hubbub. Enron placed Second behind REI of Jantzen Beach. The stats were not given, but when Heather gets back, I am sure that she can get this information and pass it on.

Thanks for everyone's participation! Lets take first NEXT YEAR!
