 Holden I am changing it to HE 11, 19-20 and the last 8 peak days of the month will have HE14.
This will bring us to the 15% Load Factor = 108hrs


The change won't come through in your Position Mgr until I recalc - let me know if you would like me to do that before tonight.
Sorry about the confusion.

Thanks for your help,
Heather
