DJ Avista's New 280-MW Rathdrum Unit In Final Test - Source 09/06 11:15 =09=

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Avista Corp. (AVA) has started the final, seven-day t=
est of its new 280-megawatt Rathdrum power plant unit 2 in Idaho, a source =
familiar with the plant's operation said Wednesday. The generator, which wa=
s generating near full capacity Thursday morning, will enter commercial ope=
rations if the final test is successful, the source said. The company would=
 only confirm that the unit is in tests and declined to estimate the start =
of commercial operations. The original schedule, set when construction bega=
n in March 1999, projected the plant would be on line in the fourth quarter=
 of this year. More recently, however, the company had pegged commercial op=
eration for August. A couple of previous attempts at the final, seven-day t=
est had to be abandoned. Avista spokeswoman Catherine Markson declined to s=
ay what problems had arisen. "It's just the normal start-up testing sort of=
 stuff. We're still way ahead of schedule, which is contracted with vendors=
 for Nov. 1," Markson said. -By Mark Golden, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4=
