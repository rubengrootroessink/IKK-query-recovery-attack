For the past several weeks, we have been working diligently to receive the parking subsidy from Houston.  However, due to the bankruptcy filing Enron has not been able to process checks.  

For the month of December, you will be personally responsible for your parking. This includes all parking lots (Lot 108, Lot 303, the WTC parking garage) and any parking validations.  

If you have been parking in Lot 108, Lot 303 or Lot 2WTC, your responsibility begins 12/1/01.  For those parking in other lots, we will be unable to reimburse employees for the month of December.

For those who have a payroll parking deduction, we will stop the deduction on the 12/31/01 pay period.  Grace and I are working on a resolution plan for the monies that were deducted incorrectly, so please be patient as we work through the various issues. 

It has not been determined whether Enron will continue to subsidize parking but you will be notified as soon as we receive information from Corporate.

We sincerely apologize for the insufficient notice and the inconvenience that this may have caused.  Again, thank you for the patience.  We are all trying to do our best in a difficult situation!
