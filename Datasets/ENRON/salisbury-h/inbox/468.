BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Freight Markets 
Enron Freight Markets signed four capacity contracts with three new counterparties to finish the third quarter.  Three of the capacity deals were for options that will allow EFM to take up to 49 million truck miles along 11 different shipping lanes through 2003.  The contracts will be used to meet current customer needs, as well as to expand the foundation of products offered by the mid-marketing and trading groups.


IN THE NEWS 
The Fittest 50: Winner Profile 
Power the Web: Using a small energy trade site as a springboard, Enron transformed itself into a master of e-markets. 
Darwin Magazine BY DAINTRY DUFFY

Enron launched its online energy marketplace in November 1999. Still, many longtime customers were wary of the change. "I had one guy that I was talking to for three to four months, and I couldn't get him to trade online," recalls Larry Gagliardi, director of marketing for the crude oil and refined products business. "Finally, I talked him through it: 'Put the little arrow on the sale price, click and you're done,'" Gagliardi says. "The next day he did five trades with us. The next week he did 20. The following week he did 40 in one day, and I had to call him and tell him to slow down."

An extreme case of love at first site? Perhaps. But the simplicity-and the lack of red tape and paperwork-of EnronOnline has rocketed the company to success.

Since launching the site, Fittest 50 winner Enron has not only revolutionized the energy markets but pioneered the Web as a supremely easy place to buy and sell commodities. EnronOnline now encompasses 30 commodity markets, from forest products and plastics to broadband and weather futures, and currently averages a whopping $3 billion in transactions per day. "EnronOnline is one of the leading examples of the right way to apply technology," says Bruce D. Temkin, group director at Cambridge, Mass.-based Forrester Research. "While other dotcoms tried to invent new business models, or made them up, Enron has done a great job of [using technology to] extend its business model."
