The following day ahead tag# 24395 for the 11th was denied by WACM because it was submitted after the 3:00pdt tag deadline.  Tag# 24365 was the predecessor and was approved by WACM.  Still, WACM refuses to approve TAG#24395.  Please copy this tag and submit it as a real-time schedule on the 11th.  Sorry for the inconvenience I received ZERO cooperation from the control areas.   Please check out with each control area when submitting the new tag.  Per Mary at WACM, I could not tag this schedule day ahead.  

Thanks,
Stacy
