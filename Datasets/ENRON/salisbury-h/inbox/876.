PGE has informed us that they have a couple of voice mail cards that are down.

WHAT THIS MEANS:

If a call that is going to voice mail hits one of these cards, the call will continue to ring without ever getting to voice mail. 

This is a random event as calls get routed to cards based on availability.

If this happens, the party would have to call back and try again, or get a hold of your admin to leave a written message.


THE FIX:

PGE will have cards here in the morning and will replace them on Saturday.  They are waiting to do this because it will require a system wide outage of voicemail.

The repair is currently scheduled for this Saturday, 10:00 PST and should last no more than 2 hours.


Please let me know if you have any questions.

Regards

Dave
