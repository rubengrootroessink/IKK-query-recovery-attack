We should seek some kind of confidentiality assurances from Pac that they won't share our price or identity with their merchant side to prevent them from front-running our desk.

Subject:        Request for Proposals - PacifiCorp Eastern Control Area 



The regulated merchant arm of PacifiCorp is requesting proposals from entities who are capable of supplying electric resources delivered to PacifiCorp's Eastern electrical control area.  Responses to this Request for Proposals ("RFP") are due prior to 2:00 p.m. Pacific prevailing time on October 19, 2001.  Both supply-side and demand-side resources capable of being scheduled for delivery on a day-ahead and/or hour-ahead basis are welcome to bid and those resources capable of accepting schedule changes during the day and/or hour of delivery will be ascribed the highest value.  Resources not capable of being scheduled for delivery in advance are welcome to bid under this RFP, however, they will not be valued the same as resources capable of meeting their pre-scheduled amount with a high level of consistency. In addition, resources that are capable of providing either the spinning or non-spinning component of operating reserves are also encouraged to bid under this RFP. 

Please review the RFP carefully.  Your proposal will be considered separate from any existing wholesale purchase, electric service or DSM agreements you currently have in place with PacifiCorp. Entities bidding must have either FERC status for resource delivery or be capable of delivering resources under existing regulated restrictions and appropriate retail tariffs.  PacifiCorp intends to pursue definitive agreements with entities that provide PacifiCorp with the best combination of resource characteristics and evaluated resource costs, including credit risk factors.

The RFP provides a contact number for questions and shows a schedule for submittal.  Please note that a Notice of Intent to Propose form must be returned by October 1st in order to bid. There will be a pre-bid conference scheduled in early October.  We look forward to your interest and proposals.  If you still have additional questions, do not hesitate to contact Lisa Lynch, Project Management Office at (503) 813-5669.
