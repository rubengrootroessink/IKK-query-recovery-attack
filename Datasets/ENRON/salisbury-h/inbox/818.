    We have a few old 17" monitors that we would like to offer for sale to the employees of the ENA Portland office.  The monitors will be offered as is, no warranty for $10.00 each.  If you are interested in purchasing one, please let me know by close of business Monday August 13. On Tuesday morning, we will hold a drawing to allocate the available Monitors.
 
We will keep the list of people wanting one in case we run out of monitors this time around.  If more monitors become available, we will work our way down the list.
