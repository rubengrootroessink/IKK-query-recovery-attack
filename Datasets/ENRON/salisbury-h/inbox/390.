As you may know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former
officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and state court. Some of
the litigation claims relate to the performance of the Broadband Services
Division.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests
in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to
preserve documents that might be used in the litigation.

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended
immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings,
e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way
relate to the performance of the Broadband Services Division, including, but
not limited to, the demand for bandwidth, the Company's efforts to create a
trading market for bandwidth, and the creditworthiness of participants in
the market for bandwidth.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement
of federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal
penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously. In the
meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone
other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.

If you have any questions, please contact Charles Schwartz at Vinson &
Elkins L.L.P. at 713-758-3852.
