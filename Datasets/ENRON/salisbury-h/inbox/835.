To Our Valued Traffic Report Clients,
 
Today, FriedWire's Traffic Report experienced a disruption in service as a result of network and general connectivity problems caused by third parties.  We apologize for this inconvenience and are working with all of our partners to insure that this does not happen again.  As always, we remain committed to providing you power markets information around-the-clock. 

Product Update 

FriedWire has just added significant new content and capability to the Traffic Report, which are outlined below.  Please contact us for brief, online tutorials on how to use the new features. 

NOAA Climate Prediction Center (CPC) Weather Forecasts 

    3-7 day Maximum Temperatures 
    6-10 day Outlook and Temperature Probability 
    8-14 day Prognostic Temperature Anomaly 
    Excessive Heat Outlooks (for the same time periods listed above) 
    Precipitation Outlooks and Anomalies 

***You may also be able to set up e-mail notification services to alert you when the new forecasts become available so that you don't have to continually check to see if the new data have been posted. 

Available Transmission Capacity 
FriedWire has developed a new interface that will allow you to search for available transmission by path.  The new geographic interface will allow you to choose a path and then view the detailed ATC offerings and then navigate to easily see reverse-path information, thru-path offerings, offerings from non-path providers and more. 

***E-mail and wireless text-paging notification services are now available along with the new ATC interface.  Now, you can be automatically notified when new ATCs are posted by providers or on paths that you track ongoingly.  You can custom define your alerts according to the provider, path, service increment, time period, class, etc.that you're interested in, as well as define when you want to be contacted (days of the week, time of day, times per day, etc.). 

The following additional product upgrades have been deployed: 

All hourly offerings are now reflected in military time designations. 
Hourly ATC selection reflected now as a range (i.e.; 13:00 - 14:00) instead of hour-beginning 1:00 PM. 
Eight new flowgates have been added for Sierra-Pacific Power and 74 for MidAmerican Energy.  They all have Intertie Profiles and can be located by selecting "View All Interties".  All will be located and plotted on the power flow maps in the next couple of weeks. 
 You can now add one (or multiple) e-mail and text-page addresses easily in order to get Alerts from the Traffic Report.  Simply click on the link that says "My Account" at the top right-hand corner of any Traffic Report screen and look for the link just to the right of the E-mail * input field that says Enter additional e-mails.  Go to the Add an E-mail Contact link at the bottom of the next screen. 

We hope you enjoy and find useful the new version of the Traffic Report.  Please stay tuned for more exciting additions in the near future. 

Sincerely, 

Bill Townsend 
President 
FriedWire Inc.
