Cara.

I'm going home for the weekend and I thought I would let you know the
procedure to follow to get your schedules at MEAD scheduled real time.

These are the schedules that are in as a preschedule:
	TAG   0025726
	TAG   0025777
	MSCGO1 TAG MSCI113

The left over mw's, after these tags,  will all have to be submitted as a
realtime tag NO EARLIER THAN 4 HOURS BEFORE THE SCHEDULE RUNS.

You will have to call PSCO marketing realtime desk to tell them what you new
tags will be  303-308-6175.  They have a heads up from me as to what you
will call about.  If you do not call,  THEY WILL NOT PUT THE SCHEDULE IN, WE
WILL NOT GENERATE.

I understand EPMI's problem today.  I've been there when I worked for MIECO.
Our control area that we turn all our schedules into are kind of hard to
work with sometimes.  It is up to them weather or not a schedule gets put in
as a preschedule.  Before they go home every night, they must check out
preschedules with their adjacent control areas.  Since they work on an
hourly basis, and don't get bonuses,  they are not always willing to stick
around and wait on late tags.  Between 3:00pm and 4:00pm MDT, they take the
tags they have and start to check out with them.  Everything else must be
put in real time.  This sometimes makes our jobs harder but there is nothing
I can do about it.  I hope everything else goes well and these schedules get
put in.
