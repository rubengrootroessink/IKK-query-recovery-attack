Holden -
Can you take a look at this itinerary and see if it looks OK.  
If you want to change anything let me know.  

Also the Travel Agency said they didn't have a profile for you 
on file.  Does your AMEX card end with 41005?  If so then we have
the correct information for your card.  

Thanks, Jill
