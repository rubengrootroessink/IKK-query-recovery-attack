Hi Mike,

Starting July 2001, we have updated our energy loss rate for ancillary
services from $0.47644 to $0.45764. Apparently, we have been mistakenly
overbilling our customers by $0.0188 since March 2000. Therefore, a credit
will be issued in the July 2001 invoice for the differences for the period
from March 2000 to June 2001. Please update your total current ancillary
services rate to $0.6812(roughly 68 cents).

Thanks,

Jackson
