Mark,
If you where to look at it from an Palo index basis, how would this look?  I think he wants to float with an index price but wants some feel for what type of basis to Palo we would use.   Its not really a firm bid since he is not really going to transact, so its really an indication of the market.  Kind of odd, but the better we make our price relative to Palo, the more likely we can get the business.  We should show him a strong bid subject to credit etc.   When the time comes to actually lock it in,  and most likely he will not since the units have no historical performance,  who knows what the market price  will be.

Mike
