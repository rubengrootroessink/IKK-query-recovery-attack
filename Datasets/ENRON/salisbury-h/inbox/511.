Holden,

  Can you (Mark or Tom) provide any off-the-top-of-your-head information about El Paso?  Marina is doing a project in school and had the following question:

Virginia,

I am doing homework now, and I need your help. For my finance class, we are 
investing for real a 1 million $ in the stock market, my sector is Energy 
and I am doing a recommendation on Thursday this week. I am trying to decide 
between 2 stocks: one is El Paso Corp, the other one is Philips Petroleum. I 
know we do business with El Paso. Any valuable info that you can provide me 
with will be a great help (i.e. are they a good customer, how are they doing 
in your opinion, that type of info).
Sorry to bother you with this but it is really important. I will be making 
my presentation in front of the Trustees of the fund.

Thanks,

Marina
