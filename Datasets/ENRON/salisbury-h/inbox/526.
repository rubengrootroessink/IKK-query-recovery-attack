I am trying to locate the basis price.
Do you know anything about the basis price?

you have to add the basis piece in from the exotic book also to come up with the fixed price in deal entry

Casey when you moved the CSU deal # 573463 from the Exotic Book (13982) to Enpower - where did you receive the strike prices?


The STSW desk looks at the contract for the Strike price, which has the following:

10/1/00-9/30/01 = 28.082
10/1/01-9/30/02 = 28.9245
10/1/02-9/30/03 = 29.7922

Deal Entry has

10/1/00-9/30/01 = 27.832
10/1/01-9/30/02 = 30.0345
10/1/02-9/30/03 = 31.2522



Do you happen to remember where these prices had come from?
