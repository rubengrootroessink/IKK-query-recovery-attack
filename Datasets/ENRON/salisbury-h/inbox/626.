Good Morning,

We are pleased to announce that Bala Kandaswamy has joined Enron's Information Technology group working on the new Volume Management System.  Bala has been working for Enron for the last year as a Razorfish consultant on the VMS project.  Bala and his family recently relocated to Portland from Los Angeles.

Thanks, David Poston
