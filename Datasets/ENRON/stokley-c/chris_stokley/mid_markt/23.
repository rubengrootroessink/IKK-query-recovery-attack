Godfrey:

Attached is a spreadsheet indicating the payment I would like made to Harbor ASAP.  As I told you, for numerous reasons, we are late in payments to Harbor, going all the way back to July 2000.  Our lateness has already cost us a least $75k in interest reflected in the attached payments.  Please do everything you can reasonably do to get them the $2,757,248.74 for the remaining amount due for July - Sep business.  All deals are in EnPower except the ISO amount which can be confirmed through Chris Stokley's group.  The $2.7 million dollar figure represents the sum of all deals in EnPower plus the ISO amount less payments already made.

Thanks

Chris

PS  Melissa...Help????
