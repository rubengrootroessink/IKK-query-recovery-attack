Melissa:

Can you please give me an update on the Harbor Cogen payment?  We told the client they were going to be paid today.  I phoned Godfrey who couldn't tell me the status.  I will need to inform the client what is going on first thing in the morning.

Let me know if there is anything I can be doing to avoid situations like this in the future. 

Thanks

C
