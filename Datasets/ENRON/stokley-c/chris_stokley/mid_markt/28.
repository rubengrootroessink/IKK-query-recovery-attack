THIS IS JUST A ROUGHT  DRAFT:

Hello Dudley,  So I see  you have added mindreading to your many talents.  =
I never said that I wish  you would go away.  I have made reference to the =
fact that your continued  need to be a victim gets really old.  As I've sta=
ted many times just call  me anytime.  I'm usually home in the evenings aft=
er 5:00PM.  If you  ever try to call and miss me I will call you back.  I a=
m more than willing  to discuss these items with again.  We have discussed =
them since your  request and I thought we were clear on them.  But we can s=
urely discuss  them again.  I have given you Ravens school schedule and Sch=
ool name as you  requested a while back.  You said that you would call the =
school and get  the info yourself.  I thought it would be redundent to send=
 it to you in  addition.  What Chris and I would prefer is that you discont=
inue putting  words into our mouths.  You do a fine job staying out of Rave=
ns life by not  sending letters or calling.  About the Christmas gift, he d=
id get it but  since he didn't get a birthday gift from you he thought that=
 mabe that was it  and that you were going to send him a christmas gift lat=
er.  But if you  would have called him you would have known that he did get=
 it.  The only  "ripples" are caused are your own doing.  Have I ever denie=
d you visitation  or opportunities to come see Raven.  I know that you and =
I can honestly say  No.  As far as making love, how can someone that loves =
you make try to  convince you to have an abortion? ASSHOLE...
