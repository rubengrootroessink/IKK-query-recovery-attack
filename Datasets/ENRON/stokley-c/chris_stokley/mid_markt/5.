K:

I wanted to document what just happened on receiving a dispatch instruction from the ISO for Harbor Cogen (harbgn_7_units).   At 12:20 we received a dispatch instruction from he ISO due to the Stage 1 emergency.  The request was for 1 MW from Tosco and 27 MW from Harbor.  

As you know, we are no longer the SC for Tosco and have sent you the required documentation.  Can you make sure the ISO has this in their system?

With respect to Harbor, we were running 60 MW and were inc'd 27, indicating a request for a total of 87 MW.  We already had an approved outage request from the ISO as indicated by the fax I sent you indicating that Harbor only had 80 MW available.  So, the ISO should only have been able to dispatch 20 MW.  

We initially declined the dispatch instruction from the ISO due to the errors the ISO made and the confusion it caused us.  We immediately "hit the phones" to clarify the facts and subsequently inc'd generation to 80 MW by 12:45.  Why did the ISO dispatch group not have our outage request indicating a maximum of 80 MW? 

We believe we have completely responded to the ISO's instruction and should have no penalty charges.  Please let me know the settlement implications of this confusion event.

Thanks

Chris
