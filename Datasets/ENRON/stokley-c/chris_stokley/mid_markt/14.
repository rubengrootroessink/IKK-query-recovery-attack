The pricing indicated on the attached matches our records.  I will have someone contact you to provide data so you can send us an invoice (Chris Stokley can you help on that?).  We will not be signing the attached contract, but that will be no problem as it looks like we are in agreement on price and quantity.  The reason for this is that we want to get a Master Agreement in place with you guys.  That will be forwarded to Ken today.  Then, all deals will be confirmed by us under the Master.  Signing confirms without a master is something that creates some internal issues for us. Please let me know if this plan creates any problems for you.

Thanks!
