K/C/M:

I wanted to document the things that I hope you guys can make some progress on next week as I will be in Houston and won't be able to bug you personally:

1.  Arco - Kourtney to send Alicia a spreadsheet (use the one I started - attached, make a new one or send the carp report) indicating the bilateral and real time activity that resulted since March 30, and the ISO imbalance activity based on meter reads if possible).

2.  $150 payment issue - Kourtney to recalculate the January payments and enter annuities to true them up based on the $150 cap on an hourly basiis rather than for the day's average.  The generators will probably owe us $ as a result of this recalc.  And, send out spreadsheet documentation to support our January payments

3.  December recalc. - Murray to recalc the Dec. %.  Can this be done and send out payments/invocies for the new %?

4.  EPMI Policy on ISO payments - Chris S. will get with Tim B. next week to accept or modify my receommendation for handling ISO short pays by next week so we can begin sending out estimated invoices/payments.

I know you will miss me next week, but I am sure I will be in your thoughts.

Thanks!

Chris
