Murray/Chris:

Please proceed with processing ISO settlements for the December through March period for Wheelabrator Shasta and Martell, Delano, Tosco and Arco.   I had planned on trying to process these statements in conjunction with a legal settlement with these clients, but after talking to legal, we concluded that such a formality is not the best approach.

And, beginning with April, now that we are caught up, please immediately process ISO statements for all California generator SC clients except Harbor as Donna finishes here estimate and Caroline finishes her final.  I will work directly with Volume Management each month on the Harbor process as we have previously agreed.  Also, we plan on utilizing Volume Management to interact with our clients to explain the Volume Management reports as it is my understanding we will no longer be using the "Kourtney Tool" to show the hourly ISO amounts.  

Thanks!

Chris
