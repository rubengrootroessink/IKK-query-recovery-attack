We need to straighten out this latest mess. I know you wish I  would go away
but that is not an option.
Let me know when a good time  is to call so we can talk peacefully. What I
would like to discuss are  following things:
1) Child Support
2) Visitation Rights
3) Summer  Vacation with Raven
Reminder... You said you would send me your thoughts  on visitations the last
time I sent you my proposal. I never got  that.
You said you'd send me his school info but I never got that  either.
I assure you that if we could come to some common ground I could  stay out of
of your life 99 % of the time. Something Chris and You would  prefer.
I'm sorry you still have so much resentment/hate toward me.  Though there
have been several occasions Chris and you have done your best to  cause
unnecessary ripples in my attempt in building a relatioship with Raven  
will continue to try.
No matter that you regard me as a "sperm  donor" I have contributed to
creating the life we call Raven. So next time  you see him just remember I
was not donating sperm to you but we were making  love at the time.
Let go of the past please and lets do what is the best  for Raven.
Sincerly,
Dudley Raven Bailey
PS Did Raven  ever get his xmas present from me?
