Chris:

I entered the Services Profit Annuity into EnPower for Oct.  All deals should be in the system no so we are ready to "true-up" the Harbor Oct. settlements.  By my calculations we should be paying them $185,631.78.  Let me know if you are seeing another number.  And, please work with Houston to set up the payment and let me know when the payment will be made.

Thanks!

Chris
