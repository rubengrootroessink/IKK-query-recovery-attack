Chris:

I didn't exactly ask for confirmation.  Can you let me know if the payment is set to be made?

I just correct a mistake in one of the dela entries for Harbor.  The attached spreadsheet reflects the correct amount.  The total payment to Harbor should be $2,770,821.77.  When you are set to make the payment, please forward an e-mail to Harbor (or me).

Thanks

Chris
