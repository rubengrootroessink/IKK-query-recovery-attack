You are receiving this message because you have been identified as a potential approver for IT hardware purchase requests charged to your cost center.  On April 2, you will begin using Enron's iBuyit eProcurement tool to approve IT hardware purchase requests online.  

The purpose of this message is to:
* Provide logon instructions.
* Point you to documentation on how to approve using iBuyit eProcurement.
* Provide answers to questions you may have.

How will I know if I need to approve an IT hardware purchase request?
If an IT hardware purchase request is submitted to your cost center and is within the appropriate dollar-level limit, you will receive e-mail notification that a request awaits your approval.  You will be prompted to launch iBuyit eProcurement to approve or reject the IT hardware items.  If you do not have approval authority, you are not required to take action on the e-mail notification.

How will I log on?
When you launch iBuyit eProcurement, you will be prompted to provide your User ID and Password.
User ID:  Your SAP User ID  
TIP:  This is the Personnel ID (PID) that you use to access SAP-related applications, e.g., eHRonline.  If you do not know your SAP User ID, please call SAP Security at 713-345-4727.
Password:  ENRON1
IMPORTANT: When you first log on to iBuyit eProcurement, you will be prompted to change your password.  You may use the same password you enter when logging on to other SAP-related applications, e.g., eHRonline.  Should you select a new password, your password in other SAP-related applications will automatically reset.  You only need one password for your SAP User ID (PID).
