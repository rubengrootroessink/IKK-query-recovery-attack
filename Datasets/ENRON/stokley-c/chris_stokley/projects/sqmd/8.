Mechelle,
              I  should have an answer today on the month that had the greatest number of resubmittals to the ISO. What are the dates that the ISO is showing for the greatest UFE inpact? Also, I will try and set up a time later in the week that Murray O'neil and myself can come by to get an update on the audit.
 
 
                                                                       Thanks
                                                                         Chris
