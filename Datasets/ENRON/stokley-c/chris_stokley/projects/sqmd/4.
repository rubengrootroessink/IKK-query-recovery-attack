Chris,

It is my understanding that Kevin Hughes was going to contact Murray to discuss
the ISO Audit status.  No decisions have been communicated to me thus far.  We
are awaiting direction from EPMI or EES before commencing our work.

Thanks,
Linda

          Chris,

          Thanks for your reply.  I received the ISO requirements
and timeline; the
          requirements appear to be materially consistent with
prior year.  We can set up
          a call to discuss the audit as early as next week, as we
are in the midst of our
          earnings release testing this week.  Would next Thursday
morning around 9:00
          a.m. (your time) work? Any other time on Thursday would
work with our schedules.

          Thanks,
          Linda
