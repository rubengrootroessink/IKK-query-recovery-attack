The information we require is 2000 dynamic load profiles for individual rate classes by hour (or 1/2 hour).  The attached link is where SDG&E has this type of information but 2000 DLPs are not posted.

Chris,

We require 2000 load profiles for SDG&E.  Unlike the other utilities, SDG&E does not have 2000 LPs loaded on their web-site.  Do you know of a contact at who may be able to help us?

Thanks,

Ken
