Chris,
No problem.  Just trying to verify your/Murray's schedule.  We will need to spend a fair amount of time together, as we previously discussed.  I want to ensure you guys are aware of everything and we have thoroughly thought through the issues, how they are worded, what the corrective actions are, etc.  So, we will need time to go through in detail, re-draft, review again, etc. until we are all confident we have a good product.

With that in mind, you are in Houston the week Labor Day (Tue - Fri??, I would guess?), what about the weeks of 8/27,  9/10 and 9/17?  We are still receiving a few last details/wrap-up on the draft, as you know.  We could review with you before it is totally completed, but the more complete the better.

Just glancing at my schedule, it looks like next week and the week of Labor Day are already quite full, so the week of 9/10 may be best.  We can jointly make the call when I hear back from you.

Thanks.

Mechelle,
	I apologize for not getting back w/ you in a timelier manner. I will see if there is any way we can fit something in for tomorrow. If not, we could come by some time during Labor Day week when we are back in town.
