Chris,  

I would have Maurice move forward with the request.  I would make sure that we know what detail data we want them to provide in the file and what format we want it in and have that in the request.

We should also have a listing of all of the meters we expect this information to come in on so we can validate that we are getting everything we want.

Ask if there is an automated process on the CSC side where we can send requests for data.  In other words.  Can we submit a request to a server which will kick off an MV90 job and that job will kick out the results to a FTP site.   (Same concept we have with ISO meter data - for generation).  

If the automated process does not exist ask CSC what it would take to create it.

Thanks for the update - MO

Subject:	Load Forecasting access to MV90 interval data

All,

I spoke with Pat Priestley this morning about our request to get access to the MV90 daily interval meter data for load forecasting.  She said that she would not be available to meet formally until Monday due to the declared disaster at their operations due to the flood.  She said they are moving back to the Pennzoil building today and Friday, so things should be close to normal by Monday.

Pat said that it is not be a problem to export the MV90 data (in just about any format) on a daily basis for us.  The data is housed in MV90 databases which , according to Pat, can only be read by an MV90 system; so we would need to purchase MV90 (very expensive) if we wanted to read the data directly.  

I suggest we get the data exported daily from CSC to an FTP site at Enron, because they can manage the process on a daily basis.  We can sweep the FTP site daily and have it automatically imported into our databases.

If we are in agreement with this solution, I  will create an emergency work request with CSC to begin working on this immediately.


Maurice
