Here is the comparison of our EES California load forecasts using  forecasted weather data (high/low temperatures) from the days for which the day-ahead schedules were created (anywhere from 2 to 4 days in advance of the actual scheduled day), and actual weather data which was used to "back-forecast" the days for which we already scheduled.  If you have any questions, please contact me.  Thanks.
