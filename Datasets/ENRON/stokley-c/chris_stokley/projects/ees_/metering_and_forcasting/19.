Neil -- to confirm what we discussed this morning and to keep others in the information loop:
The attached message is apparently in response to a request from Diann to try to get us better data from the utilities or from the CSC process, particularly with regard to customer switchover dates.  I have been pushing on her to get the information we need (although she reminded me it is no longer her job to do so), and she in turn asked Jay Bhatty to extract the data.  I have left a voice mail for Richard Miller, who is unavailable today, asking for a meeting or message outlining where the responsibility now resides that was formerly under Evan Hughes' operations group.  I also spoke with Diann, who told me she has a meeting set up with parties from the "service desk" in the new EWS organization handling data requests and CSC liason duties for us.  I asked her to impress upon them how expensive omissions can be.  She thinks an announcement of a reorganized group is coming as soon as Monday.

The CSC representative in Dublin producing the "Frazier report" mentioned below told me that PG&E has agreed to start submitting the expected switchover dates, but will back-date those fields for meters that are already flowing (ones that resulted in the shortfall between expected and actual load of returning customers).  That may be important in determining if there is any recourse for tagging the utility with some of the cost of underscheduling over the last two weeks.  I will keep you updated as I learn more.  Meanwhile, the load desk is making what we believe to be reasonable assumptions of load ramp-ups in August and beyond.  Call if you have questions.

Subject:	Work Requests must be WRITTEN and emailed to Me and Jay

 		


FYI----We must have written requests that explicitly define all work requests.  Please provide this and we will work it into the queue.
We will attempt to do everything as fast as possible, but we must prioritize the work.

I have told Jay NOT to do any work requests based on verbal instructions from anyone.  This is brutal but necessary.

I know there is a version of a "Frazier Report" that can be provided by CSC.  I know that certain knowledge has been passed to 
Michael Frazier.  

I must have a written request for your project.

Jay's main job in to do set-up enrollments and train our team to do set-up enrollments.
He will be assuming the meter and DASR functions as necessary beginning next week.

Jay is not available to do data requests if there is any chance at all that CSC can do the work.
If CSC does the work late or wrong, that is another issue.

Thanks, Richard
