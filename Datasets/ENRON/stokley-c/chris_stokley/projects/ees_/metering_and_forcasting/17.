For clarification, let me summarize my understanding of discussions held over the past few weeks concerning data requests and reports from your group and from CSC.  For forecasting and scheduling purposes in both established and new markets, we need to develop the following products and services:
1.  Capability to identify, track, and cross-reference customers by all unique "meta data" such as name(s), address (service sites), account number(s), underlying LDC/UDC (by service zone where applicable), utility tariff and profile, etc. and to aggregate loads by these descriptions.
2.  Capability to capture and store for subsequent analysis the 12-month (or longer) billing history provided by the UDC/customer when deal is initiated.
3.  Capability to incorporate and utilize metered data and billing data into a forecasting and scheduling process for all customers (existing and potential) where physical delivery of gas or power is required or anticipated.
4.  Reported data must contain specific identification of those customers who are/will be physical and best known start and stop dates for physical service.
5.  Capability to monitor validity of forecasts on a near real-time basis by comparison with actual aggregate load(s), as estimated by pre-settlement quality data.
6.  Final settlement quality data that is as complete and accurate as possible.

It is evident that data collected by or under the control of your group is integral to accomplishing the above.  Your unique placement in the process, as interface to CSC, means that data from origination, deal sheets, dasrs, and meter ops passes through your group, directly or indirectly.  The following information, at a minimum, would seem to be key components of a process needed to provide such data needs to the Load desk:
1.  Access to live data feeds, where available, for metered data from MDMA and other systems (EDI,...).
2.  Access to alternative usage information systems such as files sent by UDCs or posted to websites.
3.  Deal sheet and DASR (or "de-DASR") information to anticipate changes in customers.
4.  Query and report capability to obtain routine reports, such as a weekly report on the impact on load of added/returned customers, and to obtain special reports, such as customer count or load by region, rate class, UDC, demand zone, or individual "deal" (like UCCSU, IBM, Sony, etc.)

In order to better develop our capabilities, the load desk has been working directly with CSC and through your group to turn that data into usable information.  We now understand that you wish to establish a single point of contact with CSC for facilitating development of customized reports or interfaces for data.  In addition, your group plans to add in-house querying and reporting capability that would augment or replace certain report needs from CSC.  I would suggest we meet and discuss again the exact form and timing of deliverables from CSC, or your group, that will be used, in turn, to underpin the systems and products needed from my group for more accurate forecasting, scheduling, and trading.  A meeting this week, while Chris Stokley could attend, would be especially helpful.

If everyone would please let me know your schedules for this week, I will arrange a meeting time and location.
I greatly appreciate your help in this matter.
