I spoke with this guy at Iron, the company the sells MV90.  MV-Webb may be what we need.  He says it costs about $50k but we may be able to get CSC to pitch in.........they also have some load forecasting tools.......see below

Sorry about our meeting.........I will try to set one up tomorrow, if things go as planned tonight.

Maurice,
Here is the MV-WEB demo website information as requested.  I have also
enclosed some brief white papers on other solutions from Itron EIS.  Again I
will be going through Houston next week and could visit your site either,
Wed. or Friday to discuss any of these software solutions.  Please let me
know if I can answer any other questions for you.  Thank you for your time
and consideration.
