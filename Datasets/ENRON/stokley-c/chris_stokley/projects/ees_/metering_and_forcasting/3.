Neil,

Pat is meeting with the CAISO auditors all afternoon, but I have asked if she can give us some time after 5pm.  If she is not available, what time tommorow morning is good for you? Chris and Micheal?

Also, I have attached the CSC systems drawing that I spoke of in our last meeting.

Maurice

Sounds like a feasible solution to me as long as we can get specified formats and the data uploads are well-maintained by CSC.  Are there any extra costs on their end for performing this posting function?

Subject:	Load Forecasting access to MV90 interval data

All,

I spoke with Pat Priestley this morning about our request to get access to the MV90 daily interval meter data for load forecasting.  She said that she would not be available to meet formally until Monday due to the declared disaster at their operations due to the flood.  She said they are moving back to the Pennzoil building today and Friday, so things should be close to normal by Monday.

Pat said that it is not be a problem to export the MV90 data (in just about any format) on a daily basis for us.  The data is housed in MV90 databases which , according to Pat, can only be read by an MV90 system; so we would need to purchase MV90 (very expensive) if we wanted to read the data directly.  

I suggest we get the data exported daily from CSC to an FTP site at Enron, because they can manage the process on a daily basis.  We can sweep the FTP site daily and have it automatically imported into our databases.

If we are in agreement with this solution, I  will create an emergency work request with CSC to begin working on this immediately.


Maurice
