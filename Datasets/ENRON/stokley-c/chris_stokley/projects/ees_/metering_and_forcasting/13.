We have a common logon id that everyone uses.  The people that I know of who normally access the database
are Michael Frazier's group, John Rutledge from IT supporting Michael Frazier, SH, Maurice, and John Hamby.

Vivian has regained access to the MDMA.    However, I need to control who has access so that we don't interfere with CSC's operation.  Let me know who will need access to this data.  Thanks.
