This report compares load forecasts created using forecasted weather data in order to create day-ahead schedules and forecasts created using actual weather data received after the forecast date has passed.  It will be provided regularly in order to keep you informed of the accuracy of our forecasts based on unexpected changes in weather.  If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me.  Thank you.
