Please note that the IBM load (approximately 40 MW per hour) in the PGE3 demand zone that was expected to be returned to PG&E bundled service on June 1 is now expected to remain a scheduling and supply obligation for EES.  A complete hourly schedule for June 1, including IBM and incorporating all known changes confirmed by that time, will be sent on Tuesday May 29.

In addition, a sample "flash report" based on weather-corrected load projections and the explanation of available forecast detail will be sent on Tuesday.  Please call me at 713-345-3200 or Michael Spruiell at 713-345-8644 for questions.

Thanks
Michael
