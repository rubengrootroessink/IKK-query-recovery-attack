Confirmed with Charles Alvarez some questions that came up at yesterday's meeting:

Regarding the elimination of PowerStation, this is only for the West Desk, not East Desk.

The "Cadillac of Servers" is being employed for RPS, in order to boost performance. (It even comes with a longhorn hood ornament!)

The "80 Gigs of space" has been reserved for Steve Gullion's use. Charles says that once we're ready to proceed with the Load Database, it will not be an issue to get server space and an Oracle database setup for us. (i.e., we will not--more than likely--need to purchase additional hardware.)

Have a great weekend,

--John
