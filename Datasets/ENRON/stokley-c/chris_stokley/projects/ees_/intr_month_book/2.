Brenda,

We are exploring ways to obtain previous day's hourly meter read through MDMA.  Are you planning to store hourly metering data in Project Ranger as well?  And when do you plan to have these data available for access?  Of course I can't speak for everyone but I think we will be more than happy to get the data from Project Ranger rather than from CSC.

Thanks,
Kenny H.

As part of Project Ranger, it is my goal to have a single repository to house all actual data, allowing users to access data through an ad hoc reporting tool.  Additionally, as areas identify needs, I would hope that we can develop feeds rather than just ad hoc reporting.
 
We are setting up a meeting with CSC for this Wednesday to discuss the needs and start defining Iteration 2 of the project.  Vivian forwarded me this meeting that you have already set-up.  My question:  Without knowing the full scope of your efforts, I'd like to propose a single initiative to obtain actuals.  Additionally, we wanted to set-up this meeting for Wednesday when the CSC business analyst is in town.  Do you think it would be advantageous to combine the meetings, and schedule it for Wednesday?  
 
We will move forward with our efforts and will schedule a meeting for Wednesday.  If you all want to combine efforts, please let me know and we will include you on the meeting.
 
Chris - I had already included both you and Murray on the invitation listing.  Will you forward this E-mail to him?  I'm having problems trying to call up his E-mail address.
 
Please let me know.

Kenny Ha who works for Anthony is already setting a meeting with the Portland guys on this.

Should you just attend this meeting or do you still want to have a separate meeting.  Kevin

Crippen is not going to be in until Wednesday though.
