Subject:	RE: Request Escalation for MV90 Interval Data Project

I need a timeline of the request, and what has been going on for the past couple of weeks related to this.  When was the request made?  When did CSC receive it?  What have they done with it?  I know this was discussed several business days back.
 
I don't have a problem with the approval for the emergency request AFTER someone explains why we have had a delay.

	Steve and Bob, please work with me Monday morning as soon as possible to do whatever we need to do to escalate the status of this 

	request to the highest response level possible.  Help me get the approval and forms needed to initiate work on this project on Monday.

	If we need to meet with the requesters, please advise.  Thanks, Richard

	Subject:        MV90 Interval Data

	I am trying to help some people in our team to obtain a data download from MV90 of all interval usages on a daily

	basis.  This has been a big issue with our traders in the California market.  They have been trying to get this information

	to get better Schedule numbers for power usages.

	John Rutledge from IT had filled a work request for CSC to start this work, but according to CSC, for this to be approved

	as an emergency request you have to approve it.  This is a high priority request for the traders.  CSC can start on this

	Monday first thing and start giving us samples.

	Please approve this request as an emergency request.  Attached is the work request and I've asked Richard Miller to

	help escalate this also.

	Thanks.

	John-

	I have attached a copy of the Work Request for this effort. Please review

	it to be sure that it accurately reflects your need.

	Everywhere on the form where you find 3 questions marks (???), you need to

	supply the data. If there is no information to be filled in, feel free to

	leave the field blank. The only fields that are REQUIRED are the fields for

	Lead requestor (the person who can answer questions related to this

	request), the Alternate requestor (someone who can answer questions in the

	lead's absence) and the Business sponsor (the person who can authorize

	spending for this effort if it approved -- must be VP level or above)

	When you have filled in those fields, please forward this form to Jackie

	Jackson (jjackson@enron.com) for submission to CSC in Dublin. (They are

	aware of this request, but need the official request from Enron.)

	Please let me know if you have any questions.

	--Steve

	Chris--

	To clarify what I meant regarding prioritization:

	CSC handles multiple, often independent, requests from ENA as well as EES,

	many

	of which are of the "we need this as soon as possible" variety. What they

	want

	from us (not just EES, but Enron as a whole) is a prioritization of *all*

	of

	these outstanding requests, not just what our group might have asked of

	them.

	Sorry about the confusion,

	--John

	Subject:  WIP for MV-90 data

	Steve--

	Here's a quick synopsis of what we need:

	   Users want actual historical metered data. If they can't get the data

	before

	   it has been EEV'd (?) by MV-90, they need to know, for each value,

	whether it

	   is the actual metered amount or an estimated value.

	   Users understand that there may be missing data, but do not require the

	   meta-data detailing this. However, this is with the understanding that

	the

	   back-fill data will eventually arrive at some later date.

	   We want any account- and meter-descriptive data as well as the

	associated

	   volumetric data.

	   A  test file to see what kind of data are available and a few

	consecutive

	   days worth of data to get a feel for volumes are needed.

	   If data is received from 12 - 6 a.m., how soon after 6 a.m. can we get a

	   file?

	Please do not "burn in" this process just yet because data and timing

	requirements may change.


	Chris--

	With the bullets above, Steve has promised to turn around the completed WIP

	by

	COB today or tomorrow morning. Hopefully this will at least get the ball

	rolling. It is then up to the business to determine whether to proceed and

	how

	to prioritze it. There must be concerted effort from the business to

	prioritize

	requests to CSC. Steve gave me Richard Miller's name as the EES coordinator

	for

	these requests. Please contact him and let me know what you find out.

	Going forward we MUST establish who is responsible for filling these things

	out

	and keeping track of them. I've heard different things from different

	people,

	and I don't want to end up (nor should anyone else) being the person who

	fields

	random and anonymous lobs from the other side of the fence.

	Cheers,

	--John
