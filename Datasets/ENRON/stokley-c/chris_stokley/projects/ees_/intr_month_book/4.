Todd,

I assumed that the "new position value" is what will be allocated to the Site Profile Desk, right?

Thanks,
Kenny H.

OK.  I figured it out.  The problem with our analysis yesterday was that we were not capturing the value of the incremental volumes at current curves.  In effect, we have new volumes which need to be valued against the current curves for the first time.  Yesterday, we were valuing the new volumes at prior day curves.  This is WRONG.  The spreadsheet I have attached shows the new rules...
