Is EPMI involved with the APX also ?  They do not indicate a time line here but I assume they are talking about the end of last year/early this year. 
Let me know if we need to be more involved in this process.

Independent System Operator and the California Power Exchange.  APX strongly
encourages you to read this letter in order to protect your interests
regarding these refund claims.
