Murray,

Over the past two weeks I have been engaged in the same activitiy you describe - trying to get included on ditribution lists and brought into the loop.  I am involved in the Project Management office of Project Gutenberg (as of Monday), and I am atending Project Ranger meetings.  I have a full copy of the CSC and AVISTA agreements.  I think that is about the extent currently.  Sounds like you have the data around Gutenberg.  Project Ranger is a tactical initiative led by Robert Bailey in Evan Hughes organization that is intended to be a Repository for actual settlement data.  I have committed to Beth that I would set up a status meeting with Robert to summarize the initiative, status, deliverables and timeline.  I will include you and Chris in that meeting.  It will probably be the week of 7/9.

I have attached Paige's listing of issues.  This is from the Gutenberg perspective as that is Paige's full-time focus.  Hope it helps.  I don't be leive you would be interested in the CSC or AVISTA agreements, but if you are, let me know.  I have only hard copies, and the AVISTA agreement is manageable in size.  However, the CSC agreement is very large.  Either you are Chris are welcome to stop by and look at it when you have time.

Just on another note, can you help me better understand the role you and Chris are playing?  It will help me better understand how we will need to interact and how I can help you all better, or even more, how you all can help me!!  Look forward to working with you both.

I will be out of the office next week (I felt I better get in a few days off before my role really cranks up!), but let me know when you all are back in Houston.  We will have to plan lunch, or drinks and dinner.  Take care, and have a great 4th!

Brenda,

Yesterday, 6/27/01 when we were in the meeting with Jay Lewis, you had a document which I believe contained a list of all of the issues to date.  I think you referenced the document as being something which was put together by Paige Grgrumulaitis.  Can you please forward myself & Chris Stokley a copy of that document.

In addition, it would be beneficial to these efforts if you could add us to any distribution lists which have already been established or will be established in the future  for scheduling meetings, distributing communications?  

It would be helpful if you could provide us with any documentation which we may have been previously distributed. We are looking for any documentation that references process and / or systems for EES current or future state.
I currently have two documents from the Gutenberg team:  
 1 - ("Gutenberg "Is" and "Should" cross-functional process maps")
 2 - ("Gutenberg Calculation Engine Project - Phase I) dated May 25, 2001.  

There are many activities currently underway in this transition, and I am making these requests in hopes that we can prevent people from trying to reinvent the wheel or performing redundant activities.  

Any assistance you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks - MO
