Here are a few of the issues that I am aware of and trying to get resolved:

- Some of the larger retail deals do not show up as retail because they were booked as "wholesale" equivalents.  Due to the complexity of the deals and number of batches, it is my understanding that it will take a while before these deals get booked properly given current resource availability.

- There are several counterparties and /or batches that show up on the reports as "?".  This is a naming convention issue which I don't believe will take too long to resolve.

- NP-15 and SP-15 have several positions showing as direct access that should not be (ie Seagate, Lyons Magnus, Unisil, Starwood).  I have followed up on this but not received a response yet.

- Many of our index priced deals show up in our positions without any designation that they are financial positions.  RPS does not currently have the capability to differentiate between physical and financial.

There are also several issues relating to CTC dates and transition periods relating to other regions.  Chris Leonard and I are going to talk about this today and figure out who we need to follow up with.
