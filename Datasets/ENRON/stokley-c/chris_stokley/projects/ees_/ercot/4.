Everyone

Clarissa and John have pulled together all of the changes we suggested in our Fri. meeting. This should be our final attempt for any changes to these confirms before we send them back to Legal as APPROVED. Please look these over carefully before we submit. Let me know when each of you are OK with these forms.

Thx

Berney
