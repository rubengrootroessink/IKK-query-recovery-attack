While cautious of the issues we face, I'm very encouraged by your experience and your willingness to help. 

I tried to summarize the issues discussed in the meeting this afternoon in the attached report. Please let me know if I've erroneously attributed your name to an issue. 

Don't pay much attention to the Scenario at the bottom of the report. I haven't spent much time on it. 

 

We will continue to fill in the blanks (and probably add issues) over the next few months. 

My short term goal is to identify the vast majority of the issues and have a plan of action related to those issues within the next week. 

Any feedback you have is welcome.
