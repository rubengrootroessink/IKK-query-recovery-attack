Subject:	FW: Meeting Thurs. 8/2 on Texas retail issues

Please attend a premeeting on Thursday 3:00 in 3109 to discuss the above item.

The objective of this meeting is to discuss our strategy and process required to fill our wholesale and retail needs in Ercot as a group.  We need to define the process that we will be using to fill the Ercot load from the wholesale/retail markets starting from the meter to the wholesale settlement process.  This needs to be a common vision and documented process between us for all.

This premeeting will allow us all to get ready for Nancy and capture any additional action items for the above objective.

Please ensure that any additional staff required are invited.

At Lloyd's request, I've scheduled a meeting at 4:00 on Thursday, in EB 3109, to discuss issues related to Texas retail power sales.  Nancy Hetrick and Thane Twiggs will be on hand to update us on requirements that EPMI needs to comply with in order to sell retail power within Texas.  Please feel free to bring anyone else you think might be interested.  Also, please let me know if any scheduling conflicts arise.
