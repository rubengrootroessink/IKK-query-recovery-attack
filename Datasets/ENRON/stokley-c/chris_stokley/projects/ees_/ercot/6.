That's great.  Are Murray and Stokley here? I worked with them in the Portland Office.  I'll get a room for 10am Wed morning.

can we meet Wednesday sometime between 10 and 12? there are a couple of people from the Portland office that I'd like to attend. we can probably benefit from their knowledge of what we've done (and haven't done) in CA

Preston,

We've got a process for customers sending information to EPMI so we can load it into our scheduling & settlements software.  It takes very little effort but it is currently a manual process--(i.e., a .csv file is emailed to EPMI).  In the meantime, we'll work that way until we get a more automated process (we've already alerted our programmers to the solution you've suggested) in place.  I'd like to meet with you Wednesday morning so we can start this project. Let me know a good time and I'll get a conference room.

As far as moving to 31, I agree with your relocating here. We'll discuss those logistics on Wednesday, if that's OK with you.

I look forward to meeting you.

Regards,
Jeff Miller

Issue: Technical interface issues. Do we interact (send schedules, trades, etc.) using e-mail and Excel spreadsheets or do we develop a more sophisticated interface? 
Proposed solution: Smith Day and I have gotten our IT groups together for preliminary discussions about how to develop and maintain a common shared interface. I propose we continue this effort with the goals of (1) automating the process as much as possible and (2) giving us access to as much market/settlement information as possible.
