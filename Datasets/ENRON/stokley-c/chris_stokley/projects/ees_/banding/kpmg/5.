Kristin/Steven -

Thanks for the reply.  To answer your questions:

1.	The assistance you and Steven will be giving by going through some
contracts will be invaluable.  We have had several meetings lately with
representatives from all sorts of Enron groups, but have still not been able
to at least minimally define a solid contract.  This is an absolute
necessity for designing and building the validation and reconciliation
tools.
2.	It is actually Steve Watson, not Scott.  That was my mistake.  He is
a contact of ours in Toby Ellis' group, which is gathering power contracts
and copying them for us on an ongoing basis, including new business.  The
process being followed for this detailed in the attached presentation.  We
have not fully developed a plan for how to handle new business, but such a
decision is forthcoming.
3.	As for the number of contracts, I am not sure.  We of course have
the paper copies delivered so far, which equal 6 letter-size boxes, with
about 5-7 pages per each contract.  On top of that, there are some contracts
being copied at CSC, totaling about 10 full file drawers, although we are
not sure yet of the overlap of these with our already on-hand copies.
Finally, we do have extracts from the RPS and CSC (Loadstar and STAT)
systems.  The CSC dump equaled about 32000 records, which are summarized in
the attached Excel spreadsheet.  The RPS dump equaled about 15000 records,
but no real analysis of the comprehensiveness of the data has been executed.
We are working with IT and business representatives to garner a more keen
understanding of the fields themselves, as well as determining what
additional ones can be of use to us, so as to formulate a final request for
RPS data dump.
4.	Rest assured that the work is being executed.  We currently have 6-7
staff persons on hand already.  With the preparation of the Access DB for
contract validation today, alongside our already available set of contracts,
there will be plenty of data entry and validation work to do.

Please contact me if there are any other topics you wish to discuss.  I can
be reached by any means as listed below.

Josh,
Thanks for the update.  Please include Steven Fisher on all
communication related to the project.  He is leading this project from
Enron's side.  Just a few questions/comments:
- Steven is in the process of finalizing necessary fields.  Our plan is
to go through a few contracts ourselves to ensure we are not missing
anything before you guys ramp up.
- Who is Scott Watson?  
- How many contracts do we think we have? I may have an EES resource to
help track down contracts.  
- Let's just make sure we have enough contracts/work to keep that many
people busy.  I'm doubtful that we do at this point.
Thanks again,
Kristin





Kristin -

I just wanted to drop you a line since my last email communication last
week
to give you a status on our current activities for the Power Contract
Validation/Reconciliation Project.

1.	The Access Database that will be used for the validation and
reconciliation processes is 70% complete.  Our estimate is about 1.5-2
days
for completion.  The main issue slowing the development process is that
we
are still trying to identify all of the required fields for a complete
Power
contract.  After doing so, we will need to go back to the folks working
with
Scott Mills to do another RPS data extraction.
2.	Toby Ellis' group has been working to gather paper contracts
from
the Legal Dep't, CSC, and Origination so that we have all of the sources
necessary for validation and reconciliation.  As further contracts are
generated and/or located, they are copied and on a daily basis, we are
to
meet with Scott Watson mid-afternoon for ongoing collection.
4.	Leveraging the experiences of the Gas Project, we are currently
documenting the processes and procedures that the staff personnel will
use
to actually execute the validation and reconciliation procedures.  This
should ensure a smooth transition for them.  I will look for Chris',
Murray's, and your recommendations for these at some point by end of
week.
5.	We are currently ramping up the staff involved with this
project.
By week-end, we should have about 7-8 staff personnel on board.  Finding
a
physical location for everyone will be difficult.  Murray O'Neil, Chris
Stokley, and one of the office managers in 3 Allen are aware of this
need
and its urgency, and are working with me to arrange the space.

Please let me know if you have any questions about the above.  I can be
reached at any of the numbers/locations below.  Thanks.
