Kristin -

As per our discussion yesterday, I am writing give you a status on the
Access Tool we are building for the Power Deal Validation and Reconciliation
processes.  We have taken the Gas Tool's model, and begun to modify it to
suit the activities planned for Power deals.  This work has focused thus far
on the look-and-feel of the tool, with work on the data and performance
factors promptly following, scheduled for completion by early next week. 
T
 he modification process has also considered some additional Power deal
required data, which were not necessary for Gas.  Also, in consideration of
the initiative where we will work to calculate/correct the settlement
amounts on the deals, we have developed a billing section.  In this section
we hope to leverage paper contract, CSC, and RPS validated and reconciled
deal information to pump through a calculation engine for said settlements.

Please take a look at the attachment, which includes screen shots of the
main sections of the tool so far.  The screens developed are mostly useful
for the validation and reconciliation activities, although others are
pending modification or development, as needed.  We hope to use your
feedback for tweaking the screens.

Thanks for the time and I hope you enjoy your weekend.
