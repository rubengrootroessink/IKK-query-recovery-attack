Just a reminder to everyone that we will be meeting with Dickson Koo
tomorrow at 2pm to discuss the Power Batch Modules and how pricing, volumes,
etc., are calculated and fed into the RPS system.  As well, considering the
potential for large amounts of manual data entry of contracts during our
validation procedures, we will be discussing options for appropriately
handling this on a periodic basis.
