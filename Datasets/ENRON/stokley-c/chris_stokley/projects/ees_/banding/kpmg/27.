Paige,

I set up a time with your admin to meet with you tomorrow about the baseline
database at 10:30am.  Please let me know if that will work out for you.  

I also met with Chris in the afternoon and gave him an overview on what we
went over today.  He will try to come to the meeting tomorrow.

Thanks,

Annie
