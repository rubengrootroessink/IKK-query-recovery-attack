We will meet tomorrow at 10AM to discuss the contents of the Project Ranger
data extracts delivered thus far.  We can use the Team Room at 2946.
Briefly, we will need to cover the following:

1.	Addition of "STATUS" and "METER #" fields to the Project Ranger data
2.	Rationale behind the extent of customer data included in the Project
Ranger extract
3.	Specific needs of the Power Contract Reconciliation Team for
activities involving RPS and CSC data
