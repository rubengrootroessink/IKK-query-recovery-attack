Murray -

Sorry for the delay.  We spent a lot of time this morning working with the
designer of the Gas solution.  We have a much better understanding of their
business case now, and of course the resultant IT solution.  This should
help us in attacking the Power issue.

Attached are the updated memo I sent yesterday, with a more detailed
description and an illustration of the data flow, and a new document with a
set of questions that we may use to steer our initial information gathering
sessions.  Please take a look at these and let me know if you have any
questions.

Annie and I will be meeting with Chris for more business case understanding
next week.  I look forward to this time, and will work with Randy Wilson to
post status to you by week-end.  Thanks.

Joshua,

Thanks for the document.  I am also a very visual person.  Can you
please forward me a data flow where I can see the sources of the
information and how they are tied together.  Don't spend a lot of time
on it. I am hoping that this has already been put together.

Thanks - MO

 << File: Enron-GasAccessDBArch-Aug2001-IRM.doc >> Murray -

As requested, I am attaching here a document describing the high-level
uses
of the MS Access Gas solution.  It also details the main table and the
primary key for all records therein.

Please review and let me know if you have any questions.  Annie and I
have a
meeting planned with the developer of the Gas solution tomorrow at 9AM,
after which we are planning on working with Chris to identify some of
the
key data areas required for the Power solution.

Thanks.
