Murray/Chris -

Attached is an Excel spreadsheet with the breakdown of the CSC-extracted
power data.  You will find that the majority (~70%) of the contracts are
PG&E or Southern California Edison Co.  Additionally, we noted that 144 of
the deals have repeats, with varying numbers of repeats by each account, and
resulting in 305 records with non-distinct account numbers.  These numbers
are listed in the last four pages of the report.  We have not determined the
reason some of the account numbers are repeated.

The data extracted from CSC includes the following fields:

ENTITY (LoadStar, EESI, etc.)
POWERLINE_CUSTOMER_NAME
ENRON_ACCT_NUMBER
POWERLINE_DEAL_NAME
CUSTOMER_TYPE (Residential, Commercial)
OPCO_CODE (Operating Company Code?)
PES_INVOICE_DATE
SERVICE_PERIOD_START
SERVICE_PERIOD_STOP
TOTAL_CHARGES
TOTAL_USAGE
UOM (?)
FLAG (?)
SERVICE_CODE (Status)

We are in the process of identifying the main contact at CSC to describe the
data to us, as some of the fields (e.g., those with ?'s above) contain
values that we are not familiar with or that exhibit some non-clarity.  For
example, in the Status section of the summary report, you will notice some
"DE-ACTIVE", "CANCELLED", and "CLOSED" types, which seem all to be the same
or quite similar in nature.  We want to make sure that we understand these
values and where they come from in order to work with the data.

Please review my report, and let me know if you have any questions.  As I
continue to work with the data, I will be able to speak to these.  Thanks.
