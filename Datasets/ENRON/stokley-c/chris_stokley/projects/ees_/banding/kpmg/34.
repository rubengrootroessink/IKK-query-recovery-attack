Chris as discussed this morning attached is the scope document.

 
This morning's meeting has helped in defining the types of calculations / reports that will be needed in the database.  

Outcomes from the meeting are:
Verify transaction economics for newer contracts
Power Baseline team to compile data so that you can get an indication on the number of contracts that have baseline information for California.  
Data relating to material change will be captured and we will attempt to identify trends in the data captured.
Process flow to be prepared for baseline / bandwidth capture

Items that we are waiting on from you are:
Confirmation that we will be basing calculations for bandwidth on Project Ranger data
Copy of some sample MDMA data for use in constructing the database.
Confirmation of the scope described in the attached document.

Call me if you have any questions at 832 465 5443.
