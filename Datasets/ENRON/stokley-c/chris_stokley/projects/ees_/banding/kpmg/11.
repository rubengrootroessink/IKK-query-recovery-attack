Chris -

We have gathered the information from the Gas Team as to what the procedures
are for rounding up contracts.  These details are illustrated in the
attached PowerPoint presentation.  I am assuming that the Gas approach will
serve as the basic model of the Power roundup activities, with minor
adjustments, depending on such things as regions, number of contracts, and
the like.  Please take a look at the slides and give me any feedback you
feel necessary.  Today, we will be working to establish communication lines
with the listed contacts, as well as determining contact points where holes
exist.

Also in the presentation is a slide describing the procedures for
controlling paper documentation for new contracts.  As you'll recall, the
Gas group has established a new process for capturing deal information,
something that has been in place since end of July.  Given the fact that the
RGS system is still live during the contract review process, however,
another review will have to be executed at some future point in time in
order to cover any new deals being incepted.  Your feedback on an approach
to handling this for Power deals will also be valuable.

Thanks and have a good weekend.
