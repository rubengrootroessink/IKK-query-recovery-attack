Chris -

Find below the details as to the Power Baseline/Bandwidth Project Status.

Issues/Addressing Actions
*	Issues that have been identified with approximately 50 current
contracts visually reviewed:
*	Bandwidth (Max and Min) but NO baseline
*	Baseline with NO bandwidth
*	Min Bandwidth noted but NO Max bandwidth. 
*	Baseline with no level of aggregation noted
*	Bandwidth with no level of aggregation noted
*	No escalators for Baseline
*	No escalators for Bandwidth
*	CSC data has not been reviewed (Chris S to follow-up) - Data from
Project Ranger may also address (see below)
*	Decision on how to aggregate data volumes for CSC data (Chris S to
follow-up)

Current status
*	The Access DB tool has been completed with regard to requirements
submitted as of Friday, 9/21/01.  Development is in progress for the
calculation functionality, as is the necessary gathering of CSC/billing
information for volumes.  We expect that we can finish this request within a
week, if we can obtain suitable CSC/billing information soon.
*	We have met with a contact from the Enron side for the Project
Ranger.  Vivian Hart is providing for us thorough documentation on the
status strategy and tasks, as well as a data model depicting their solution.
From this information we have identified and scheduled the necessary data
extraction information to assist us in determining what data source will be
used for the baseline/bandwidth calculations.  This data contains 8 months
of volume information (Dec 2000 - August 2001).
*	Statistics of data analyzed:
*	Missing data (common areas where data is identified as missing) : to
be determined when a greater population of contracts is analyzed
*	Contracts processed : 35
*	Deals processed : 350
*	Deals with baselines specified : 90 (of 350)
*	Approximate minutes processing time per contract : 8

Future planned activities
*	Annie Leung and one KPMG staff person are dedicated to the
baseline/bandwidth data capture activities.  One additional staff will be
added per week for the next couple of weeks.
*	Contracts continue to be copied at the Pennzoil Place location of
CSC (Houston, TX).  Preparations may be made by end of week for a trip to
Dublin, OH with the Gas Team to obtain any further contracts.  We are
working closely with a contact in the Legal Department to refine the number
of expected paper contracts; we will retrieve any that they have on-hand as
the week wears on.  After these activities, our final option will be the
originators.
*	Full validation is underway on the paper contracts available,
focusing on the CA utilities first.  As discussed, the Baseline/Bandwidth
data capture activities require less work, and so these activities are
occurring after validation procedures.
