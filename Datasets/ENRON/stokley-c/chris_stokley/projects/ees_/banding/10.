Chris - Attached is the spreadsheet shared with KPMG.  Feel free to add anything else needed for settlement.  One area that we thought you could provided a lot of insight to is the upper/lower band and parameters needed for to figure these calculations (hourly, daily, monthly, annually, etc.).  Call if you have any questions.  Please forward back with any changes you might make.

Thanks
Steve
