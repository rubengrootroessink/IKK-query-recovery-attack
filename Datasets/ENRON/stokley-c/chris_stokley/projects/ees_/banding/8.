Attached is the same spreadsheet that lists out 70 plus information fields needed for the power process.  I have taken a first cut at what we specifically want validated by KPMG.  I have made these fields red or if you print you will see a small x to the left of the field name.  Please review and let me know if there are other fileds that should be validated in this process or if I have highlighted fields that do not need to be validated.  We can discuss this afternoon.
