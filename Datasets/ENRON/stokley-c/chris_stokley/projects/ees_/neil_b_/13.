Neil,
The revenue for the sale that Phil entered to the CAISO will be captured by our volume management group.  RT will have no access to this revenue.  Consequently, we will not buy or sell it on your behalf to capture it.
Please give me a call tomorrow for a more thorough explanation.
Thanks,
Bill
