Diann,

What is the status of the check for this true up?  I spoke to Cheryl and she wants to pay in one lump sum as opposed to the two seperate checks.  I have a call into the Controller to discuss delaying the payment until July 1 (for Q end purposes)  So let me know where we are on generating a check for these guys.  Thanks.

Ress,

Where are we with the January true-up.  I need to give Southland an idea of when we think those revised settlements will be finalized.

Thanks 

Lamar

Hi Lamar: 
Just following up on our conversation a couple of days ago. Any additional information regarding when I should expect to see the check? By the way, why don't you send it to my attention: 7-Eleven, Inc. , 2711 N Haskell, Dallas, Tx. 75204 Attention: Ed Herman, Legal Department. I will make sure it gets to the right folks. Also, any guess as to when we will know the resolution of the January  bill (i.e. when the outside agency will make the rate determination?). 

Please keep me posted. 

I appreciate your help in this matter. Thanks. Ed
