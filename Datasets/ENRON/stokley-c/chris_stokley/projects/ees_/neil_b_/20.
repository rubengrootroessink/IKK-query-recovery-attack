The attached presentations have some info which may help.  Regarding bands, in CA, PacBell and UC-CSU have no band.  All other commodity only transactions have +/- 10% band on annual basis with the exception of recently executed deals (monthly band) and old deals ran which were associated with the national "outsource" transactions which had customized volumetric structures (in some cases no band) which were executed and priced by the old consumption desk.
