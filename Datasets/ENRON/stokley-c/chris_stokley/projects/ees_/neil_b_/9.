Ann Watson of Comm. Bilas' office said that the decision ending DA and the =
Bilas alternate would be mailed outtoday, but probably not up on the websit=
e until tomorrow.  Everyone should watch their mail and e-mail for it.

Ann confirmed that Hertzberg had called Lynch asking for them to delay.
And, of course the PUC accommodated them today.  Ann said however, that she
was not able to hold the decision until July 12.  The reason is that a
letter from the Treasurer, DWR and Finance was sent to Commissioners and
legislators telling them that DA had to be suspended by June 28 in order fo=
r
appeals etc. to be settled by the time the issue the bonds in August.  I
believe someone else referenced this letter in an e-mail yesterday.  Ann is
appending the letter to the Bilas alternate so everyone can see it and
comment.  Also, they are going to ask for comments on going to "bottoms up"
rates.
