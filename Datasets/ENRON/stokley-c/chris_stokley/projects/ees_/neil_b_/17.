Issues:

Non performance by counterpart (don't deliver energy when called) :
- Penalty from ISO to ENA ?
- Loss of capacity payment credit back to the last date energy was called and delivered

Credit offset with ISO for receivable when energy is called 
- What is our daily debt to ISO associated with serving load (other charge types) 
- What is our corporate debt to the ISO and who manages the offset
- How do we calculate (anticipate what our debt will be foreword looking) 

What is our recourse if the Offer cap is changed within the day 

What is the minimum increment that the counterpart will sell power if called 10 min 1 hour ?) 

What are losses associated with the delivery point ? 
- Do we gross up our purchase or pay the inc price to the ISO 

Is there any congestion associated with the real-time call on energy 

Is there any congestion associated with Day Ahead Capacity 

ANY OTHER ISSUES ??????????????????????
