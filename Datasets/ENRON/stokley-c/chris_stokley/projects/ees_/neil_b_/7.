Lets make sure an estimate makes its way into our models .............

(2) When a reserve deficiency period ends and generation operating reserves rise to 7% (a non-reserve deficiency period), the maximum
price that can be charged for spot market sales in California and the rest of the WSCC during the non-reserve deficiency period, absent
cost justification, will be 85 % of the highest hourly price that was in effect during the most recent Stage 1 reserve deficiency period called
by the California ISO. An uplift charge for fuel used for start up of generators will not be included in the market clearing price, but instead,
will be recovered through ISO charges to all California load on the ISO's transmission system.
