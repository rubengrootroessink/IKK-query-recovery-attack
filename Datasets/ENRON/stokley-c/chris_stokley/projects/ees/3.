Chris-

I'm sorry that we didn't get the chance to meet before you left. Some
information for you and a couple questions:

Information:
     The Power Historical report that contains all the invoice data for all
the accounts in STAT and in Lodestart is going to be a large report. We're
estimating each report at over a million lines of data. With this amount of
data to pull and the other priority reports that we have received this
week, we will not be able to produce this information before next week.

Question 1:
     Is there a way to narrow the search on the accounts that you need for
that report so that we are not producing such a large amount of data? Are
there specific accounts we can pull or other criteria that we can use to
narrow the search?

Question 2 (different subject):
     How should the Historical Power Banding Work request read? Are we just
pulling data, are you asking us to create the invoices (what criteria are
there for this?) etc.?

I will try to get in touch with you via your cell phone yet this afternoon.
If you want to get in touch first, I'm at 713.345.6397.

Thanks,

--Steve
