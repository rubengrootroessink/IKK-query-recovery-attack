All programmers need to be getting their responses back to Anna ASAP.
We are trying to prepare for this weekends production runs.  We have a
number of estimates to complete this weekend prior to Monday morning and
want to make sure that we are aware of any screen / functionality issues
you may be aware of.

Anna should not be required to send this out again to get everyone to
respond.  

RESPOND NOW!!!!

If I come across any problems while we are working this weekend and have
not been made aware of them prior.  I will be calling you to have you
come into the office to fix them prior to the next release.

If you have any questions please give me a call.

Thanks - MO
