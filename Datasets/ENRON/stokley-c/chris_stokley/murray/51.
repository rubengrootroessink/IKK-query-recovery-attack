Brenda,
 
I agree with your proposal to only have one location to store metered consumption information.  
 
Project Ranger has always been presented to me as a project focused on getting meter data out of the CSC systems for those customers who have already been settled.   I am still trying to get my hands on a copy of the requirements for project Ranger so I have a better understanding of what the request to CSC contained and to determine what the plans are if any for the information once it is inside Enron's network.
 
The purpose for our meeting on Tuesday, (Today) is to determine methods of accessing real-time consumption information and making that available to the Intramonth book and if possible improve estimates associated with all transmission costs.  This meter information is in now way settlement quality and will be replaced with meter data which has gone through a VEE process as the utilities make it available.
 
As for combining efforts.  I'm all for it.  I have been asking to be a participant in this process for the past 4 weeks and have not received any documentation or notification of meetings regarding project Ranger.  In an effort to ensure that we are getting real-time information as a starting point we have been moving forward.  I would have to say that this information should be part of the overall request going to CSC and anyone else working on gathering utility settlement information.
 
At this point in time I'm not sure that everyone who needs to be included in the meeting today can be available.  So,  I recommend that we move forward with the separate meetings and work to combine efforts on a go forward basis.  I will try and summarize the outcome and next steps of today's meeting and pass it on to you.
 
If you need to get in contact with me please call my cell 503-702-9846.
 
Thanks - MO

As part of Project Ranger, it is my goal to have a single repository to house all actual data, allowing users to access data through an ad hoc reporting tool.  Additionally, as areas identify needs, I would hope that we can develop feeds rather than just ad hoc reporting.
 
We are setting up a meeting with CSC for this Wednesday to discuss the needs and start defining Iteration 2 of the project.  Vivian forwarded me this meeting that you have already set-up.  My question:  Without knowing the full scope of your efforts, I'd like to propose a single initiative to obtain actuals.  Additionally, we wanted to set-up this meeting for Wednesday when the CSC business analyst is in town.  Do you think it would be advantageous to combine the meetings, and schedule it for Wednesday?  
 
We will move forward with our efforts and will schedule a meeting for Wednesday.  If you all want to combine efforts, please let me know and we will include you on the meeting.
 
Chris - I had already included both you and Murray on the invitation listing.  Will you forward this E-mail to him?  I'm having problems trying to call up his E-mail address.
 
Please let me know.

Kenny Ha who works for Anthony is already setting a meeting with the Portland guys on this.
Should you just attend this meeting or do you still want to have a separate meeting.  Kevin
Crippen is not going to be in until Wednesday though.
