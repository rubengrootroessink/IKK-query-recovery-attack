I discovered this error, and had Pat send us an e-mail explaining the reason the Meter was wrong as well as updating the data.  They updated this within the 45 days.

Jim, the above settlement files were misstated due to an error in tracking 
weekend vs weekdays. The original file showed the data for 5/26 to be a 
normal load for a weekday while 5/28 reflected the load for a weekend. 
The problem has been corrected and the files for 5/26 and 5/28 were 
reposted.  The file for 5/26 was reposted on 7/17, day 45.
