Diann,

I agree with you that Maurice appears to be the resource with the most knowledgeable in the areas we are diving into.  

However,  The point here is that you committed to take ownership of  action items which came out of a meeting we had last week (I was dialed in from Portland).  It was expressed in our meeting the importance of the information we are looking an a time frame we hoped to get it in.

Chris Stokley sent you a few message in follow-up to ensure that progress was occurring and you failed to respond to anyone letting them know that you would not be the point person spearheading those action items.  (Until a week later)

We are now another week into this transition and still unable to deliver interval meter data to the business units requesting it.  If it takes CSC a week to make it available to us.  We could have had today or tomorrow.  Now it would be another week.

We all know who the responsible resources are now.  Thanks for sending that out.  It is time for us now to focus on end results and getting this data in-house.  

Thanks - MO

It was not my initiative to have this follow-up meeting, nor was I even invited to it.   When we met last week, I stressed that Maurice knew the systems better than I and I would have to defer to his recommendations.  When he was invited to the meeting earlier this week, I assumed you were engaging his expertise and that I was not needed.  

I apologize for the misunderstanding.   However, I trust Maurice's recommendations as being the most logical.  If you still need us to pursue the Energy Sense proposal, let me know.

Diann,
	You should have notified me that you had passed this off to Maurice and not acted on it since we talked last Wed. From here on out I will assume that Maurice is the key person to get these issues resolved. Based on the e-mail below, I lost one week by your not having this conversation w/ a CSC rep last week. This is a week that we could not afford to lose. 

Maurice,
	Let me know what we need on our side to get the MDMA process escalated to a high priority item. Also, what is the estimated time of delivery from CSC once we make this a priority?  I agree w/ you best scenario recommendation, I would just like to be able to compare delivery dates b/w the two process that you have laid out. Thanks for your help on these items.

			Ps. When next week can we expect CSC to deliver these accounts to the FTP server? Also, what time the next day can we pull the files off 
			      Of the server?

Chris,

In our meeting with Pat Priestley yesterday, she said it would not be difficult to post a CSV file to an FTP server for all the Interval Meter Data accounts in MV90.  Pat said that to post it in the Energy Sense format (MDEF) would be very difficult because of how the system operates.  

Pat also confirmed that they do not post data from all MV90 accounts to the MDMA on a daily basis.  I asked her if they could change this process and she said that it was something they have been wanting to do, but it has not been a high priority.  

I recommend that we get the daily CSV file from the FTP server and import it into the Load Database that John Rutledge is developing.  Pat says that if we can have the Work Request completed today, we could have this set up next week. 

The best scenario is for all the data to be posted to the MDMA daily, so we can possibly get CSC to make this a high priority.

Maurice

Diann,

	We have a few paths that we are looking into, including the one that we discussed w/ Maurice. Never at any time in that meeting did we decide not to look at the paths listed below. Does this mean that you have done nothing to facilitate these request to CSC?

Chris,  I thought that you and Michael met with Maurice the other day and decided a slightly different path.  Is that not the case?

Diann,

	Do you have an update on the status of the other two items we discussed.

1)	CSC's ability to send all of our Calf. Customers files out to the FTP server as they do with the Energy Sense customers, along with the  timeline to get this implemented.
2)	The cost and timeline to put all of our customers into the Energy Sense website.

Vivian has regained access to the MDMA.    However, I need to control who has access so that we don't interfere with CSC's operation.  Let me know who will need access to this data.  Thanks.
