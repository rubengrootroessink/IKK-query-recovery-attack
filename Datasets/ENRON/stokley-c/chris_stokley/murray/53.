To all: 

Attached is our first stab at a more detailed listing of all of the efforts which are ongoing in the operations area with owners, proposed deadlines, IT dependencies and some more detailed comments.  It is trying to tie in quite a few moving parts, so there is a lot of info on these few pages.  Hopefully still "readable".

The document also attempts to cross reference all of the various projects out there (Ranger, Genysis, Gas Solution......) -- so we all understand how these projects affect all of the initiatives that we have underway.  We will also be setting up consistent project management documentation to individually track each of the cross functional projects - to ensure that they do not impact the detailed Operations initiatives.

I intend to use this listing to control all of the Operations efforts, and as a tool to update you all on our progress (weekly initially - and then we will see what is needed).

This is a "living and breathing" document which we will be constantly adding to, as new initiatives become active and others are completed.  

For those of you who will be at the EES/EWS offsite next week, I will plan to walk thru, and for others that attend the Thursday Causey/Buy meeting will also review it's intension there.
