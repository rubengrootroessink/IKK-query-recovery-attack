Murray,
Pursuant to our discussion this morning, inclusive in this email are the detail behind a proposed method of invoicing a potential customer.  Jim Wood and I discussed a product idea for invoicing the customer based on areas aggregations by congestion zones - as determined by the regional ISO and UDC region, and as define in the contract.  This is similar to our current practices of invoicing the customer based on their internal regional alignment.  Also, inclusive in the invoice would be an additional charge (when applicable) when the customer's consumption falls below 90% or goes above 110% of their baseline usage.  The difference from current practices is that this additional charge (credit) would be assessed to the region and not to an individual site/account for this customer.  The question is, can Operations handle this type of billing method and if so, is there a potential additional cost for processing the invoice?

Thank you in advance for your expedient assistance,
