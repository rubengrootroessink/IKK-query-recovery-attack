Jason/Tom

The Mack-Cali deal is getting hot and they hope to sign an Master and CA confirm on this Thursday.

The client has a major issue with the excess and deficiency only cutting in Enron's favor.

The desk does not have an issue with letting it cut both ways.  I'm am currently investigating this with the consumption group.

Does your group have any issues with allowing it to cut both ways?   I know there is a settlement issue, but we've done it in the Boston Properties and other deals, so I'm assuming that the systems are build (or being built).

Given the tight time frame on this deal, a quick response would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

B
