Subject:        90/110 Consumption Bands

Details regarding EES/CSC deal capture and billing for 90/110 consumption bands -

Power

EWS Business Contact - Richard Miller

Deal Capture Status - Information is not included on any CSC power deal tickets (deal sheets)

Risk Book Status - Currently not captured - A.K. Matheson is researching and will provide details

Billing Status - CSC does not know which customers bands apply to - currently not applying to any power customer bills

Gas

EWS Business Contact - Lisa McClendon

Deal Capture Status - Information is included on CSC gas deal tickets (deal sheets)

Risk Book Status - Currently captured

Billing Status - CSC does know which customers bands apply to - currently applying bands to some gas customer bills, but process performed manually

        ==>  Lisa has been working with CSC this week to determine the following -

                - How many gas deals do bands apply to?

                - How is CSC tracking penalties by meter and by billing period?

                - What is total $ amount of penalties?

                - What is the estimated unbilled penalty amount and what is CSC's plan to resolve on a go-forward basis?

I will forward additional information as it becomes available.

Thanks,

James
