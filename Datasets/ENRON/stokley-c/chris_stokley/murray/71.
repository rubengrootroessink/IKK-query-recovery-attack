Attn. All,

Everyone should have access to the Global application.  (Global Counterparty, Global Facility, Global Contracts, Global Common Codes).  You should be able to find them under your start menu (See below).

If for some reason you do not has access to all of them you will need to put in a security request, requesting them.  In addition to the production application you should also have access to the Test and REP Test applications for each.  (These test applications can be found through your start menu as well under Programs>Development application>Global>

With the implementation of VMS our data processing is directly integrated with these global tables.  All Location, Customer, SE, SA...  will be driven from these tables.  

If you have any questions please give me a shout.

Thanks - MO
