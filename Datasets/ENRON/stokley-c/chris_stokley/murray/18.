The original request should have been from 97 to current.  Not just '01.

Chris, Can you please follow up on this?

Thanks - MO

I was reviewing the data dump request from Scott to Todd Taylor and wondered if this was sufficient for the settlement side of this project.  We have only requested usage for 2001 and I would believe that we would need usage information for 97 to 00.  Are we getting this from another source?  Should we stop the current request and modify or can we add this to the database with the next RPS dump request?  Any thoughts would be appreciated.
