Murray,

Hi.

I manage EWS Site Profile Desk, which is responsible for identifying, pricing and managing consumption risk in all EES deals. I understand from Jeff that you will be responsible for Power settlements and will be able to help me in developing appropriate actualization / settlement processes. I would love the opportunity to get together with you and talk about these issues at your earliest convenience. Thanks.

Mallik
