Here is the data model and data flow diagram for MDMA.  

  

I am trying to find out if the data from MV90 get interfaced into MDMA on a daily basis
or not.  If it is done on a daily basis, then I don't think there is a need to go into MV90.
MV90 will have raw data and will not have gone through validations which are performed
in MDMA.

Vivian,

	I just wanted to leave you my contact numbers:
	
						Cell:    503-807-8959
					           Work:   503-464-8219
 					          Home:   503-625-3541

	I will be flying out tomorrow, but I should be in around 1:00 Pacific Time. Please send me an e-mail on where we stand with being able to get into the MV90 tables. I have Jeff Richter chomping at the bit on this one so it would be a nice if we can get our hands on that data. Thank you very much for your help on this topic.
