Lyman,

Yea, he should be able to cover most of my concerns or inputs.  Sorry I can't attend.

Will you make sure that someone is taking good meeting minutes and distributes them after the meeting.  There are a number of different groups who will be looking for this information.

Thanks - MO

I believe Chris Stokley can address your concerns, can he not?
