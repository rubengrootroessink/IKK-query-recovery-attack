Andrew,

As discussed numerous times in the past, the Volume Management terminal server utilization / demands change frequently.  The Volume Management team has been directed by the application development group to re-run all of the reconciliation tools for September-00 through January-01.  For some reason when running this tool over the past two week the tool is taking exceptionally long.  It used to take 20 - 30 min to run for one day.  It has been known to take up to 2 hours during the last couple of weeks to complete one day.  On the average when we have to re-run for a month we don't run it day by day.  However, the amount of time required is still in excess of 2 or 3 hr window provided.  These job will take anywhere from 6 to 10 hr for an entire month. 

The dollar amounts associated with the settlements which need to be recalculated and distributed are in excess of $70 mil.  and our customers are growing inpatient in receiving their money.

Please remove the terminal server restriction on at least one of the terminal servers through 4/27/01.  If all goes well we should be successful in completing our efforts by then.

In the future when contacted by Dave Steiner with a request like this it, would be appreciated if you would take action without requesting a email from me.  We discussed with Dave what was needed and I see where someone in Houston made the decision that this was not an emergency.  Until that individual knows what is happening in our office on a real-time basis (Like Dave Does), I feel they should let the West Power Desk make that decision.  The Application Integration group can support us by helping us meet the objectives rather then act as an additional hurdle.

If you have any questions please feel free to give me a call.  My cell number is 503-702-9846.

Dave:
 
Timeout restrictions have been lifted on NAHOU-TRDTS1.  Have the users who require no timeout connect directly to this server.  Timeout restrictions will be put back into place at 5:00 P.M. CDT, tomorrow, April 17, 2001.  Any requirements for timeout restrictions to be lifted past that point will require an email message from Murray O'Neil.
 
Andrew

Eddie, 
        Murray O'Neil, the Sr. Director over this group does consider this an immediate emergency.  I am sorry if I did not make that clear.  I would appreciate any help you can give me on this, I am willing to do whatever I can if anything to make this happen today as Murray is very motivated.

Please let me know 

Dave

	David this would not be an emergency issue. I will address it with Andrew tomorrow morning. The user must maintain an "Active" connection to keep their session alive. I believe it is set to 3hrs but I will check.    

	Andrew, 

	We will discuss tomorrow AM

	Eddie, 
        The immediate issue is that our Volume Management Group run almost exclusively through Term Serv.  The processes they run far longer than the time out allows (they are getting bumped off due to some inactivity time limit).  They have a very critical need to have this limit extended or removed.  I don't know if we can by user, machine or even at all? 

	Please let me know 

	Regards 

	Dave
