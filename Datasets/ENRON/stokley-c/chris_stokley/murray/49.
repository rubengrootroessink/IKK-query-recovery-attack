Even,

Who do I need to contact to see a copy of the current Enron to CSC project request log.

Do we have a listing which contains the following information:

Request description
Requestor
Date of request
Quantifiable justification for request
Cost to Enron for CSC to do the request
Enron's priority of request
Enron's preferred date of completion
CSC targeted date of completion.
CSC current status (% complete)

Is there a formal reporting process of these requests and is there a group who manages the priorities to make sure they are in-line with the current business needs.

Can you also tell me if CSC is off on their cost estimate for doing a project does Enron get billed actual project cost or just estimated costs?

Any information you can provide related to this request would be appreciated.

Thanks - MO
