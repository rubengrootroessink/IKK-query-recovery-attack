Brenda,

I agree with Mark that this functionality does not exist today. However, I =
don't see developing a solution will be that hard.  There are very few cont=
racts / deals which will have this language in them today.  I'm not trying =
to make this sound easy.  We still need to get the input information.  Thes=
e deals will be more of the Interval meter data transactions which will hav=
e a hourly load shape and we can get access to the hourly index price.  I h=
ave access to that information today. =20

We do need to get a solution in place quickly.  I don't want to speak for h=
im but I think Mark was saying that they would not have a solution in place=
 win the current tactical solution.  I do think that we can add something o=
utside of that process which will be added back in manually at first.

I am copying Chris on this as well so he can start taking a look at it.  Th=
is is the type of activity we perform on a daily basis in the Portland offi=
ce.  There may be something which we can replicate

Chris,  Please get together with Mark and his group to discuss their proces=
s and let us know what is required.  Please provide the following in a writ=
e-up.=20

When this language came out, we sought approval, as we were well aware of t=

Please see the below contractual language and Mark Denner's response.  I wa=
nted to highlight this to all of you as this will soon be a customer servic=
e issue in additional to a risk issue.  All new non-matrix (Master and Mid =
market contracts) deals since June have contained similar language requirin=
g hourly calculation for excess and deficient usage, either using the ISO h=
ourly price or the Dow Jones daily on and off peak price weighted by the cu=
stomers actual hourly usage. =20

There are several deals that will require this calculation every month as v=
olumes have been stipulated at some percentage (90 or 95%) of historical us=
age with no bands around the stipulated volumes.  In this instance all volu=
mes above or below the stipulation are settled using the hourly mechanism. =
 Home Depot CA is a specific example of this deal structure.=20

We need to quickly formulate a plan to ensure that we are able to execute o=
n these contracts from a both a risk management perspective and customer se=
rvice stand point.  Please let me know what input you need from me.  I can =
provide example contracts and deals as required.  Thanks.

Jason, I'm very concerned regarding our capability regarding the below cont=
ractual language.  This has been the standard language in all new deals sin=
ce late June.  It was my understanding that you were responsible for approv=
ing contractual language and ensuring that Operations could execute against=
 it.  We (Site Profile Desk) are significantly at risk if they are not able=
 to execute against this language.  This language was developed as a risk m=
itigant for our desk and must be implemented.  Thanks=20

Erling...we are not set up with this capability to date nor do I foresee us=
 having this ability in the near future.  This request has come from others=
 as well and we are trying to get the word out that we do not have the syst=
ems in place to support this type of invoicing.

Just one more time for clarification.  Are the two of you in a position to =
price and bill out the below language?  It is very important that you are a=
ble to execute on the below to ensure that we are not unwitting risk that i=
s not being charged to the deals.  All new deals have this language - the b=
elow is from Limited TX - a deal that contains 90/110 bands. =20

Home Depot CA back in June did not include 90/110 bands, but rather a fixed=
 volume at 95% of their historical consumption and then similar language to=
 the below for any excess over that - thus I assume that this has already b=
een implemented for HD CA as this would be required each month.  Thanks.
