Chris,  I thought when we looked at this last week you were just going to cut and paste from Notes to Outlook.  We did that with one of the email on Friday.

Murray,

	I tried to send Mechelle the SQMD documents through the old Lotus Notes, but it would not allow me to do so. I will give you a call in the morning so we can discuss a work around. I know that Donna was able to send me an e-mail from Lotus Notes just last week.
