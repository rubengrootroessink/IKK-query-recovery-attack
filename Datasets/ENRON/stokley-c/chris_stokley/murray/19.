Wes  -- this would be my proposal for how to use these resources

Ken -- Become the Operations expert/coordinator for all Socal and PG&E Bankruptcy issues.  This includes lots of resolving billing issues, including building the necessary process around these efforts (CSC and internal) coordinating with MLR's accounting function to ensure that payments and credits are accounted for properly.   attending meetings and communicating within operations

Vicki  -- part time for Mary Lynne -- reconciliation of mid-market power  bill payment activity in the subledgers and build new process
             Part time to work and aim towards moving into GNO billing function on a longer term basis to help out there, and build future team.

Mechelle  -- Build a "SWAT" team to handle short-term, high-priority issues.  Own and manage resolution and transition back into teams
                    Potential issues could be around DASR process; Historical Validation efforts; deal capture process; etc.

Please let me know when I can move on this.  I would like Ken to be at a meeting tomorrow on the California issues
