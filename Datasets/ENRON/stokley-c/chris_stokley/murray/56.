Attached are my notes from my first week of EES Transition involvement.

I will attempt to publish updates every week.  In the future as my knowledge grows I will include others in the distribution.  (Don & Rogers?)  I just wanted to make sure that I was letting you know what I have seen, learned or been doing.

If you have any questions please let me know.

 

Thanks - MO
