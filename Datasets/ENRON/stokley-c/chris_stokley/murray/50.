Chris,

I thought this was a done deal after we talked with CDWR on the phone.

Hi Stewart,

	I am hoping to get this old issue resolved and I have that the last time we talked about this (with Thresa Allen & Diana Scholtes) was back at the end of March.  This is for the Transmission Profit Sharing that we owe California Department of Water Resources for the month of December.  Right now I have that we need to pay them $189,148.34 (CDWR profits) and this is also what you have in your spreadsheet (see attached) and what they invoiced us.  However, I was told not to pay them until you all had determined what the PX shortfall annuity would be that you would put in and apply against this payment to CDWR. Has this annuity been determined?  I would like to move this payment through our system since it is now almost 8 months old.  Let me know as soon as you get a chance,  when you expect for the Cal. PX shortfall annuity to be determined and entered, so that this Dec. payment can be sent out.

Thanks so much - Amy
