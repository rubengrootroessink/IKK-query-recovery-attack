Andrew,

As of Monday we completed our historical catch up process.  You should be able to re-implement your standard TS cycle process.

Thanks for all your cooperation. - MO

Murray:

Are you all still needing a server without timeout settings on it or can I put the server back into production?

Andrew,

We still need to have one TS which has no timeout on it.  I will estimate and say that we will need this for another 3 weeks.  We have gotten a lot of work done over the past month but still have about 3 months remaining to actualize.

If you have any questions please give me a call.

Thanks - MO

Gentlemen:

Do I need to continue to have a terminal server that does not have a timeout setting or may I return all of the servers to their normal state?  If so, can you give me an estimate of how much longer?

Thanks.

Andrew
