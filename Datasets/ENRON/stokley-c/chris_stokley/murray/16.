FYI? Not sure if you have sent his one yet.

I'm working on moving Rebecca Fite into the Retail Volume Management group.  This will help us stay in tune with all new market entries as well as new products.

I've attached the preliminary Product Approval Template for the new physical delivery product for ComEd for your review.  There are a number of actions currently underway for product finalization, e.g. contracts and load profile approval.  Beginning Wednesday morning a notional pricing matrix will be located on Market Central.  The following overview provides a product description and value assessment: 
 
Product
Illinois (ComEd) Physical Delivery Product - $/MWh discount to prevailing bundled rate (PBR) Rate 6 or 6L through February 28, 2002, followed by a fixed price for retail generation beginning March 1, 2002.
Fixed price includes energy, congestion, and losses; ICAP, ancillary services, T&D and other UDC-related charges are passed through to customer. 
The product passes through ancillary services primarily because of market power by incumbent UDC  and lack of an ISO.
Physical delivery is approved for ComEd March 1, 2002, with maximum allowable load set at 25 MWs by EWS Logistics.  Once max. load is contracted, reassessment of the cap will follow.

Contract
Currently under development (Mini, Mid) - Target date of COB 9/20, with Master to follow.

 

Regards,
Marcus Dotson
