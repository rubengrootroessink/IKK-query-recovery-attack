You need to make sure that Greg Moreno-Earle (sp) knows about this stuff in the future.  That is the person Pete is talking about.

I send this to Pete.  Is there someone on FSP/VMS who should know about these changes to Meter collection?
Poston?

Jim,

I have passed this information on to the group (Mike Marryott) that will be making the appropriate changes to the Meter Scout.

I don't own that application in the FSP/VMS world (at least for now).

The Meter Scout will have to be re-written to handle the new procedures.

Pete

Pete,

Did you see this e-mail?

Is there anything we need to do to prepare?  Want to discuss?
