Tracy, If you take the original shortfall position into consideration.  There were only two companies who paid any portion of the shortfalls (PX and Koch).

		ISO Market Participants:

		On Friday, February 8, 2001, the ISO received payments from
certain parties that had defaulted (either in part or whole) on their
previous obligations to the ISO, due on February 2, 2001 (based on the
November 2000 preliminary invoices).

		As a result of these payments the total funds which became
available for distribution to Market Participants were $149,333,046.54.  The
ISO instructed its bank to distribute pro rata payments on Friday based on
this amount.

		The ISO distributed these payments in accordance with ISO
Tariff Section 11 and Settlements and Billing Protocol ("SABP") Section 6.

		A reconciliation of amounts received with the amount
distributed follows:

Payments Received:
California Power Exchange	$ 149,349,573.52
Koch Energy Trading	$              331.73
Interest on ISO Reserve Account	 $              793.35
Subtotal	 $ 149,350,698.60

Less:
Interest Cost on Previous Borrowings on Market Line of Credit	 $
17,652.06

Total Distributed 2/9/2001	 $ 149,333,046.54

The ISO applied payments due to Market Participants under this distribution
to first extinguish any outstanding obligations, consistent with SABP 6.10.4
and 6.10.2:

		SABP 6.10.4
			The ISO shall apply payments received in respect of
amounts owing to ISO Creditors to repay the relevant debts in the order of
the creation of such debts.

		SABP 6.10.2
			The ISO is authorized to recoup, set off and apply
any amount, which any defaulting ISO Debtor is or will be entitled, in or
towards the satisfaction of any of that ISO Debtor's debts arising under the
ISO Settlement and billing process.  Each ISO Creditor and each ISO Debtor
expressly acknowledges that the oldest outstanding amounts will be settled
first in the order of the creation of such debts.
