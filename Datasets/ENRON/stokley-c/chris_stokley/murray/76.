Chris F,  What about the other service customers which we have held off on settling for Jan PX business.  Do we need to be going through the same process with them as well?

Murray:

Here is a list of the clients who I would like to be paid the lower of $150 or the PX index for PX index sales to EPMI in January 2001.  Chris S. indicated that although we might not be able to get the wire transfers out this week, we could at least set up the payments this week for payment on Monday.  That is what I am communicating to the clients.  Please let me know when Chris S. has the data he needs to set up payments.

Delano:  All hours for the Month
Tosco:  All hours,  January 1-18
Arco:   All hours January 1 - 17
Wheelabrator Martell:  January 1-17
Wheelabrator Shasta:  THey have PX activity from 1/10 - 1/17.

Thanks

Chris
