Patti,

Please schedule some time with Suzanne and who ever else she wishes to include from her business team.  I would also like to have Mark and Chris participate in the meeting.  I have copied Brenda on here so she can let you know if she wishes to participate.  Please schedule 30min for Chris, Mark and I to meet at a point prior to the meeting with Suzanne.  I want to make sure we have a list of questions formulated when we meet with them so don't make it right before.

Mark & Chris,

I think I have forwarded you a copy of the Distributed Generation proposal Suzanne has already sent out.  Please take a look at it and let's come up with a consolidated list of questions prior to this meeting.  

I'm not quite sure the function of the ROC.  It appears that wholesale has created some redundant function to those we use CSC for today.  (This could be a good thing).

Hi Murray.  I am working closely with Victor Gonzalez and Tom Blanks, and they are both familiar with the DG product.  A majority of the questions you asked below concern functions that will be handled by Fred Kelley or Lloyd Will in the Retail Operations Center (ROC).  I put my response to your questions in red below.  Please let me know what day and time is convenient for you to meet and I'll reserve time.

Thanks Murray,
Suzanne

Suzanne,

I have taken a look at your proposals and it looks like a very attractive product.  There are a few items I'm going to need to research to determine our ability to quickly turn a settlement solution around.  I do not know of any internal automated processes to support the type of billing you are proposing in your deal.  Which mean that everything would be manual.  

This type of settlement is something which is similar to settlement calculations we have performed in our wholesale business in the west.  However.  To feel comfortable that we can settle these deals in the quick turn around time which you have identified (10 days following the end of the month).

I do have a few questions which I would like to discuss with you next week (9/24 - 9/26).

Will we install meters at each facility to ensure we have real-time access to generation / curtailment data? The ROC will install interval meters on each of the DG assets.  We may or may not be able to access the data in reat time.  For LC, we will use a baseline calculation.
Who are you anticipating will install the meters and perform the MDMA function? The ROC
Will each contract have the utility / control area market price identified in the contract (Actual Publication being used in settlements)? Yes.  For example, our initial target market is New York Zones J and G.  We will settle with the customer off of the NYISO hourly posted clearing price for the respective zone.
For invoicing the Generator, Where will the Operation cost be derived from and will it be stated in the contract? The Generator will receive a fixed payment for every MWh they run.  This payment is intended to cover O&M and fuel expenses and it will remain fixed over the life of the contract.

This is the start of my questions.  As I review your proposal further, I'm sure I will have some more.

Thanks - MO

Murray,

At your earliest convenience, we would like to discuss billing for the Distributed Generation and Load Curtailment products.  I am re-sending the DG contract and power point presentation for your review.  Please let me know your availability and if you have any questions regarding our products.

Thanks Murray,
