To all Market Participants:


		As noted in previous announcements and forums, an improved
OASIS site will replace the existing site effective May 31, 2001.  All of
the existing PMI/OASIS reports that are currently available on both the
Internet and the private SI network (WEnet) will be replaced with the new
OASIS site.  In addition, all of the download templates will be replaced
with new XML technology.  If you are unsure about the effects these changes
may have on your systems, please contact your Client Representative
immediately or send a correspondence to:

xmlwg@caiso.com
