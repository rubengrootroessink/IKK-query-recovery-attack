Overview
The California ISO is enhancing two of its meter data systems, scheduled to
be in production by October 2001.  The objective of this development effort
is to provide the ISO with robust, flexible, maintainable, and more
cost-effective metering systems to meet its ever-changing market and
internal needs.  Market participants and other systems will use the internet
based MDAS-Online application for meter data submission and requests.
