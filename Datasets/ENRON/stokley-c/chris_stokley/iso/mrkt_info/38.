following days:

				Session 1: Monday, May 21st, 2001      -

				Session 6: Tuesday, May 29th, 2001     -

					We encourage all market participants
to plan on attending one of the above sessions. Due to the limited amount of
space, we ask that no more that two representatives from each company
attend. Additional representatives may sign-up to attend on a
space-as-available basis. Please notify us by May 11th, 2001 indicating
which session you would like to attend, so we can reserve your seat.
(xmlwg@caiso.com).  You will receive an e-Mail confirming your reservation.



				We welcome comments and recommendations from
all interested parties.
