		ISO Market Participants:
		In my earlier message, I stated that BEEP Split will be
become effective on May 22, 2001.  Please note that FERC has not yet acted
on Amendment No. 38, i.e., it has not yet approved the BEEP Split proposal.
The ISO issued this notice to provide the necessary ten days notice,
contingent upon FERC approval of Amendment No. 38.  But, the ISO will not
implement the BEEP Split unless or until the Commission approves Amendment
38.
