The March 4th Final Settlement Statement (FSS) was scheduled to be published
today, May 14th.  However, due to an additional data re-push, the March 4th
Final Settlement Statement will not publish as scheduled.

The March 4th Final statement will publish one day late, on May 15th, along
with the March 5th statement. The formal dispute window timeframe for the
March 4th FSS will be adjusted out, 1 day accordingly.

We apologize for any inconvenience.
