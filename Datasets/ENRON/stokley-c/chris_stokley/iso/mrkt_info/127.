ISO Market Participants:
in light of a growing pattern among Market Participants of failure to submit
feasible Schedules, failure to comply with the must-offer obligation,
failure to comply with Dispatch Instructions and the recent untenable acts
by certain Market Participants that resulted in serious threats to WSCC-wide
reliability, the ISO is compelled to immediately impose new requirements to
prevent reoccurrence of such events.  Please see the Market Notice posted at
http://www.caiso.com/docs/2000/06/01/2000060109560313721.html
<http://www.caiso.com/docs/2000/06/01/2000060109560313721.html>  for a
complete discussion of the new requirements.
