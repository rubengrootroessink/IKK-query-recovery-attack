To Market Participants and Scheduling Coordinators:

Today the ISO received a subpoena from the Electricity Oversight Board
("EOB")  which requires a response by June 8. The subpoena is attached.  The
subpoena requires monthly updates on an ongoing basis through April 26,
2002.  The ISO intends to comply with the monthly update requirement.

In its June 8 production and subsequent monthly updates, the ISO will mark
as confidential documents it produces to the EOB that contain information
subject to 20.3.2, and will request confidential treatment in accordance
with the EOB's prior agency opinion letters discussing treatment of
confidential information. Concerns related to the subpoena should be relayed
directly to the Electricity Oversight Board. The EOB contact related to the
subpoena is Lisa Wolfe who can be reached at (916) 322-8601.   The ISO would
appreciate being notified also of any concerns.  The ISO contacts are Jeanne
Sol? at jsole@caiso.com and Norma Formanek at  <mailto:nformanek@fbm.com>
nformanek@fbm.com both of whom should be copied on correspondence.
