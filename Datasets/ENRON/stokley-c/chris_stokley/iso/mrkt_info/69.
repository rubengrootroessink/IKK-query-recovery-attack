Market Participants and Scheduling Coordinators:

Attached please find two discovery requests to the CA ISO from Pacific Gas
and Electric Company in the Grid Management Charge proceeding before the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC").  The discovery requests seek
invoiced amounts for the Grid Management Charge for each Scheduling
Coordinator or other appropriate party for each month of 2001 for which
invoices are available.

There is a Protective Order in the Grid Management Charge proceeding, which
is also attached.

This message is to inform Market Participants that the CA ISO will comply
with the discovery requests, unless it receives an order prohibiting
disclosure from FERC by the close of business (5:00 PM) Thursday, June 21.
The CA ISO will seek confidential treatment of the information under the
Protective Order.  Any concerns relating to the discovery requests should be
communicated to Beth Ann Burns at (916)-608-7146 and bburns@caiso.com and
copied to Julia Moore at juliamore@swidlaw.com.

Beth Ann Burns
Regulatory Counsel
