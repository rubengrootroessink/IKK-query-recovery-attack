Market Participants:

During the bankruptcy court teleconference on discovery yesterday it was
determined that 1) for the moment, the ISO has been relieved of the
obligation to respond to the subpoena, and 2) PG&E will file a motion with
the bankruptcy judge requesting the information it requires from the ISO and
the PX.  The motion will be served on the primary contact for each ISO
scheduling coordinator.  Parties will have an opportunity to respond.
Market Participants with concerns about discovery matters in the PG&E
bankruptcy proceeding should make sure they get papers from the Scheduling
Coordinator primary contact in a timely manner and be prepared to present
their own positions to the bankruptcy court.  Market Participants should not
rely on the ISO to make their arguments for them.

In accordance with the tariff, the ISO will continue to provide notice of
any subpoenas it receives that request information covered under section
20.3.  However, once this notice has been given, Market Participants have
the obligation to take the steps they deem appropriate to seek protective
orders or other relief from the bankruptcy court and should not rely on the
ISO to argue their positions for them or to provide ongoing notices of every
development related to a subpoena after the initial notice of its reciept is
given.
