Please respond to Sole, Jeanne ISO Market Participants:

A few hours ago, the CA ISO circulated to Market Participants a subpoena
(attached).  The CA ISO has received an extension from the Committee on the
due date to Monday, May 7.  As noted in the earlier message, the CA ISO
intends to work with the Committee to develop a confidentiality agreement
addressing confidential information subject to ISO tariff section 20.3 and
will appraise Market Participants of progress.

 Any concerns relating to the subpoena should be communicated to Jeanne Sole
at 916-608-7144 and jsole@caiso.com <mailto:jsole@caiso.com>  and copied to
Charlie Robinson at crobinson@caiso.com <mailto:crobinson@caiso.com>  and
Norma Formanek at nformanek@fbm.com <mailto:nformanek@fbm.com> . The
relevant contact related to the subpoena is on the subpoena itself.
