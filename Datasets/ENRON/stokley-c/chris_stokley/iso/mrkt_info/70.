> Market Participants:
>
> The California ISO is initiating a study to determine the feasibility of
> interconnecting SCE's Big Creek transmission system with PG&E's Fresno
> area transmission system.  This study is being initiated to determine
> whether some form of interconnection between these two systems is
> beneficial to the overall system.  Some of the potential benefits that may
> be realized by this interconnection are:
>
> (1)  Expansion of the pumping window available for the Helms Project,
> (2)  Reduction in RAS tripping for the generation and pump modes for the
> Helms Pumped Storage Project,
> (3)  Improved spring and summer stability performance in the Big Creek
> system (and a subsequent reduction in RAS),
> (4)  Improved reliability for the Rector, Vestal, and Springville load
> areas following double circuit line outages,
> (5)  Additional transmission capacity for potential new generation in the
> area (Pastoria expansion and others) without major transmission
> construction, and
> (6)  Incremental improvement to Path 15 transfer capability.
>
> A stakeholder group is being formed to provide input into the studies.  In
> addition, a draft Study Plan has been posted on the ISO's web site for
> your review and comment
> ("http://www.caiso.com/docs/2001/06/14/200106141553509859.html").  Due to
> the expedited nature of this study, please provide your interest in
> participating on the study group and/or comments on the study plan to
> Peter Mackin (pmackin@caiso.com) by June 26, 2001.
>
> An announcement regarding the first stakeholder meeting for this study
> will be sent out shortly.
