Security Reasons
Version: 4.0
Effective Date: 6-6-01
Procedure Purpose: The purpose of the COI/NW-Sierra and PDCI north-to-south

WSCC Minimum Operating Reliability Criteria (MORC) and to protect the WSCC
system during heavy export conditions from the Northwest to the Southwest
from disturbances similar to those that occurred on July 2 and August 10,
1996.  The Nomograms are based on the loss of the Bipolar PDCI, a 2-unit
loss at Palo Verde, a 2-unit loss of Moss Landing, or a Table Mountain South
Double Line Outage.  The Nomograms are limited by post-transient Outages.
Changes / Reasons: Function of Sutter Power Plant for Super Heavy Summer
