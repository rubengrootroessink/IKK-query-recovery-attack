Attention PMI and OASIS USERS

Your participation is requested in the OASIS Re-design Market Simulation.

As previously announced, the ISO has scheduled the OASIS Re-design Market
Simulation for May 3, 2001 through May 17, 2001. The Market Simulation is
being scheduled to allow all OASIS and PMI users an opportunity to
participate in the use of this new functionality.

The OASIS Re-design Market Simulation is scheduled to begin with a
conference call to review the Market Simulation Test Plan on May 3, 2001 at:

9am - 10 am PST
Telephone #: 1-877-670-4111
Passcode:  246870

During this conference call, we will also request participants help in
finalizing details of the Market Simulation Plan.

All OASIS and PMI users are strongly urged to participate in this
simulation.   As noted in previous announcements, the new OASIS site will
replace all of the existing PMI/OASIS reports that are currently available
on both the Internet and the private SI network (WEnet).  In addition, all
of the download templates will be replaced with new XML technology.  If you
are unsure about the effects these changes may have on you or your systems,
please contact us immediately.

It is suggested that this simulation include personnel that would be
responsible for IT. Please respond to Jblatchford@caiso.com to be part of
this simulation. The final Market Simulation Plan will be distributed to
those respondents the week of April 30, 2001.

A separate announcement will be distributed shortly regarding user-training
sessions being offered by the ISO.
