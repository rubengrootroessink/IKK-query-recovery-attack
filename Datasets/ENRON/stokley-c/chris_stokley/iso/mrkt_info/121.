		ISO Market Participants:
		Attached is an announcement for the May 10, 2001 EOB/CAISO
Generator Outage Coordination Stakeholder Meeting to be held from 9:00 to
3:00 p.m. at the Sacramento Marriott - Rancho Cordova.  We realize that this
meeting is the same day as Market Issues Forum (MIF) and some of you may be
interested in attending both meetings. However, the tariff filing deadlines
associated with FERC's recent order and other previously-scheduled meetings
prevented us from avoiding the conflict.  We apologize for any inconvenience
this may cause you.
		If you plan to attend the Outage Coordination meeting,
please send your RSVP to Myrna Neeley at mneeley@caiso.com
<mailto:mneeley@caiso.com>  before Monday, May 7, 2001.  A conference
call-in line will also be available as follows:
		Call In Number:	(888) 261-7938
		Passcode:	9163512190
		Should you have any questions regarding the meeting please
contact Myrna at  916-351-2171.
