 - MARKET NOTICE -
SUBMISSION OF GENERATOR HEAT RATE AND EMISSION DATA

The Federal Energy Commission's (FERC) April 26, Order Establishing
Prospective Mitigation and Monitoring Plan for the California Wholesale
Electric Markets and Establishing an Investigation Of Public Utility Rates
in Wholesale Western Energy Markets, imposes price mitigation on all
generators in California, including non-public utility generators, with
available capacity during periods of reserve deficiency, defined as
emergency situations beginning at Stage 1 Emergency.  FERC's price
mitigation measures will become effective May 29, 2001.

FERC directed each gas-fired generator in California (both those who have
signed Participating Generator Agreements (PGAs) and those non-public
utility gas-fired generators who sell into the ISO's markets or utilize the
ISO Controlled Grid)) to file, by May 1, 2001 (within five days of the
order) with the Commission and the ISO (on a confidential basis) the heat
rate (not including start-up and minimum load fuel costs) and emission rate
for each generating unit.

In order to facilitate the provision and use of the heat rate and emission
data to be provided by the above-described generating units, the ISO has
developed a template (attached) for submitting the required data.  The
template requests that generating unit owners provide the heat and emission
rates at various output levels.  The template also specifies that generating
unit owners must provide the heat and emission rate data "at or near" each
unit's maximum output.

Please submit the required data, in the format specified, no later than 5:00
PM, May 1, 2001.  Please submit such information electronically to Jim Price
at the ISO (<jprice@caiso.com>).  The ISO will treat all submitted data on a
confidential basis.
