See second paragraph.  I'm still looking to see if the changed this
requirement or what the outcome of what is suggested below.

> 		Market Participants and GCP Market Participants:
>
> 		Since start-up the ISO has been obligated to gain direct
> communications access to Generating Units in the ISO Control Area, subject
> to existing contractual arrangements.  Initially the investor-owned
> utility (IOU) Control Centers and ICCP links were utilized on an interim
> basis to provide this capability, until the ISO could establish the
> communications links that would facilitate direct communications to the
> Generating Units.  This communication link is vital for all resources,
> including Generating Units and loads that provide Ancillary Services (A/S)
> to the ISO.  The ISO and Market Participants began the Generator
> Communications Project in 1998 to develop standards, equipment, and
> communications protocols to provide this link.  The initial focus was on
> Generating Units providing Regulation.  Generating Units that provide
> Regulation to the ISO must have a Remote Intelligent Gateway (RIG) unit,
> which provides the ISO direct AGC control of the Generating Unit as well
> as direct communication.  (The RIG installation at those units satisfies
> the requirements of this Notice.)
>
> 		With that phase of the installation almost complete, the
> next phase of the program has started to establish the communications
> links for all resources providing Ancillary Services.  (Currently Loads
> greater than 1 MW can provide Ancillary Services and Generating Units over
> 10 MW can provide A/S.  The ISO is currently considering lowering the
> floor for Generating Units providing Ancillary Services from 10 MW to 1
> MW.)
>
> 		This will require all remaining resources providing
> Ancillary Services to install by June 1, 2001 an ISO-approved direct
> communication system for its affected Generating Unit(s) for telemetry to
> the ISO Energy Management System (EMS).  The ISO currently has approved
> the Data Processing Gateway (DPG) technology for such direct telemetry.
> Thus, each affected Generator and Load must install a DPG for its
> Generating Unit(s) or Load(s) that may provide Ancillary Services other
> than Regulation unless it requests and receives ISO approval for the use
> of an alternative technology.  (Of course, Generating Units that provide
> Regulation to the ISO must have a Remote Intelligent Gateway (RIG) unit,
> which provides the ISO direct AGC control of the Generating Unit as well
> as direct communication.)
>
> 		As announced initially by the ISO at the February 3, 2000
> Generators' meeting for the ISO's Generator Communications Project (GCP),
> and reiterated most recently at the July 20, 2000 GCP meeting, the work
> required to install and test the DPG (or ISO-approved alternative
> technology) and to undertake re-certification of the capability of the
> Generating Unit(s) to provide Ancillary Services to the ISO must be
> completed by June 1, 2001.  After that date, Generating Units that do not
> use the DPG (or other ISO-approved) technology may be precluded from
> supplying Ancillary Services to the ISO.
>
> 		The ISO will provide a formal notice of the foregoing
> requirements by a letter to each Participating Generator.  If you have any
> questions or concerns about the requirement to install and use a DPG (or
> ISO-approved alternative technology), please feel free to call Ernest
> Senior of ISO Operations Systems (916-608-5887) or the ISO Client
> Representative for the Generator Communications Project, Dave Timson
> (916-608-7065).

> NOTE:  In order for the ISO to make appropriate accommodations for the
> interconnection between the ISO's EMS and DPGs for all Generating Units
> supplying Ancillary Services other than Regulation to the ISO, the ISO
> will be requesting that Generators provide an installation schedule
> applicable to each affected Generating Unit.  We intend to issue the
> request for DPG installation schedules by October 10, 2000.
