Chris,

I am working with John Rutledge on getting the Load Desk database up.  One of the data sources is the MV90 data coming from CSC.  I have learned that you are also in need of this data in order to compare our trades with actual consumption.  Attached is the proposal CSC gave us that outlines the tasks and the cost.  Are you the one who needs to approve it or does someone else usually approve such charges?

Thanks,
Charles
