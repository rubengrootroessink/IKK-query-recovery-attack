I received confirmation:  The Soft cap at $250.00, was effective on 12/08/00
and the soft cap at $150.00 was effective on 01/01/01.  Sorry for the
confusion, but there are so many changes going on its hard to keep up.  Here
is another market notice with further clarification on allocation:

Subject:	CAISO Notification -  New Charge Types - Soft Cap


Effective trade day December 12, 2000, pursuant to Amendment 33, the ISO
will allocate the amount paid to purchase Energy above the soft price cap
and for energy procured out-of-market to those Scheduling Coordinators who
underschedule load or overschedule generation.  The ISO has developed the
following two new Charge Types for these Settlements.

CT 481 - Soft Cap Payment to SCs
The ISO will compensate Instructed Energy providers for energy instructed at
a price above the MCP in two parts.  The amount of instructed energy
delivered will be compensated in Charge Type 401 at the interval MCP.  The
difference between the interval MCP and the bid in price above the soft cap
will be compensated in Charge Type 481.

CT 487 - Soft Cap Cost Allocation to Market
The total payments made by ISO in charge type 481 will be allocated on a
regional basis to SCs based on their net negative Uninstructed Energy in the
corresponding region through Charge Type 487.  Units providing Regulation
are exempted from the charge type 487.

The supporting details for charge type 481 and 487 will be provided in the
Instructed/Uninstructed Energy Detail Records in the Imbalance Energy/No Pay
Settlement Detail File.  The Uninstructed energy file contains a new section
called Excess Cost section.  These statement file changes are reflected in
version 12.2a of the Settlement Statement File Specification which was
distributed to TSWG and SC Settlements Contacts January 30, 2001.
