See note below. This is a mess.  I'm trying to get what the prices should be
for the error referenced below.  That way you can take the correct price,
figure out what your A/S obligation and payment should be, and pay that
accordingly.  This suggestion is not recommended by the ISO as the ISO
expects the market to pay their invoices in whole, however, when we only pay
two cents on the dollar, this is an alternative that you may want to
consider.
