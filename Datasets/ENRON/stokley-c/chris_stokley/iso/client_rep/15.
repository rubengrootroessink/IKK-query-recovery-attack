Good news.  See e-mail below.  Epstein is our Controller.  Spence is our
Director of Settlements.  Bill Regan is our Chief Financial Officer.
On another note, it has been requested that a detailed explanation be given
and what will be done to prevent this in the future.  I hope you can
understand the reasoning for this request.
