I have a request in for clarification, however, I believe that these are the
scheduled re-runs for settlements for post-final disputes that require
re-runs.  For example, your August 7, 8, and 9 disputes that have yet to be
adjusted, are scheduled for adjustment on June 29th.  Not all post-final
disputes need a market re-run, therefore, some of your postfinal disputes
may be done on an earlier date.  Once they do, I will be notified and then I
will in turn let you know.  At any rate, I will make sure my assumption here
is correct.
