> The Unscheduled Demand Penalty was ordered by FERC in its December 15,
> 2000 order to be effective on January 1, 2001 Trade Date. The ISO is
> filing a request with FERC to suspend this penalty. Additionally SCE and
> PG&E have jointly filed at FERC requesting suspension of the penalty.
> Until FERC provides direction and clarification, ISO will calculate the
> Unscheduled Demand Penalty charges and credits, but will not include them
> in the settlement statements.  There is no impact to any other charges or
> payments since the penalty and the allocation of the proceeds is self
