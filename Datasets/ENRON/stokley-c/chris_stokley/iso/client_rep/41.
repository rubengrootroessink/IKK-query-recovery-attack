 <<Keoni.zip>> Chris, per your request here are the 480 and 1480 charges
that have been tracked to date for Enron.  Please keep in mind that the
systems have not been built to incorporate this data into our Settlements
process so the normal validations built into our Settlements process are not
applied to the manual tracking of these charges. Therefore, this data should
not be considered Settlement quality.  If these charges ever to become
effective the proper systems will be built to pull in this data into the
Settlement process. 

I checked with some folks and found out that FERC should rule on this during
September. 
Take care.
