Folks, because of the many meetings that take place and the difficulty of
staying on top of all the separate issues I thought I would forward to you a
newsletter put together by my former VP, Susan Schnieder (now a private
consultant).  These newsletters are nice in that they summarize the issues
in a concise, simple to review, format.  If you are interested in
subscribing her number is on the newsletter below.  The newsletters also
summarize the board meetings, such as the one in the last attached e-mail.

November Board Meeting
Part 1:  Voting Items
February 21st, 2001

Attached are the following documents:

>  First attachment:  February 21st Board Event Report, Part 1 (covering
Board votes at this meeting)

Despite the lengthy agenda, the Board made decisions on just two items:  The
Summer 2001Demand Response Program bid awards, and the third Metcalf
Substation transformer - altogether, around $100 million of decisions.

The remaining items were discussed (except Market Power Mitigation, where no
documents were issued and there was no discussion), but decisions were
deferred until at least the next Board meeting, scheduled for February 28th
(see below).  We'll cover the highlights of those discussions in Part 2 of
the Board Event Report (Management updates and other non-voting items),
which will reach you tomorrow or early Saturday.

>  Second attachment:  Updated calendar showing tentative Board meeting
dates through the end of March.

November Board Meeting
Part 2:  Management Reports and Other Non-Voting Items
February 21st, 2001

Attached are the following documents:

>  First attachment:  February 21st Board Event Report, Part 2.

A warning/apology:  This report is pretty long, even after condensation of
background and discussion sections, because it includes all the items
deferred for decision as well as the regular status reports.  As usual, we
use subtitles and font variation liberally to aid you in skimming.

A clarification about Market Power Mitigation:  While there was no written
or oral discussion about any Management proposals, there were "Public
Comment" remarks on that topic, and limitd discussion of those comments by
the Board.  They're covered in today's report.

> Remaining attachments: Previous reports referenced in today's report.
