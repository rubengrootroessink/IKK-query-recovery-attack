		ISO Market Participants:
		The ISO has posted on its web site questions and answers
that we have received to date on implementing the FERC's June 19 Order.  You
can find them at

<http://www.caiso.com/docs/2001/07/12/2001071217543428639.pdf> .  This is
intended to be a "living document" and we plan to add to and/or modify it as
necessary.
		If you have additional questions that you would like to have
addressed at Monday's conference call, please e-mail them to me ASAP.
