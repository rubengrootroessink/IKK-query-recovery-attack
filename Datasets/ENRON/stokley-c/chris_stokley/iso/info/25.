ISO Market Participants:
In recent days and weeks, there have been many scams perpetrated by con
artists on the Internet to "help the victims of NYC and Washington D.C."
Now we are seeing unscrupulous people spreading computer viruses by using
what happened on September 11.   
An email is circulating the Internet with an attachment infected with the
Trojan_Vote.A (also known as Vote Virus, W32.Vote.a@mm
<mailto:W32.Vote.a@mm> , VBS Vote.A).
The email looks like this:
Subject: Fwd: Peace BeTween AmeriCa And IsLam!
Message: Hi! iS iT A waR Against AmeriCa Or IsLam! Let's Vote To Live in
Peace!
Attachment:  WTC.EXE
This destructive, mass-mailing Trojan was created using Visual Basic 5. It
propagates via Microsoft Outlook by sending emails to all addresses listed
in an infected user's address book.  It deletes certain anti-virus products
installed in a system, drops the files WTC.exe MixDaLaL.vbs, and Zacker.vbs.
It also modifies the infected user's Internet Explorer startup page, and
formats the infected user's drive c:\.   It parses drives and directories in
search of HTM and HTML files and overwrites them.
This malicious program is spreading rapidly, so be aware and take
precautions to avoid it.  The ISO suggests the following precautions:
*	DELETE - DO NOT OPEN - Unsolicited email messages with attachments
from unknown sources.
*	When in doubt, DELETE it.
*	Scan all attachments from unknown sources.
