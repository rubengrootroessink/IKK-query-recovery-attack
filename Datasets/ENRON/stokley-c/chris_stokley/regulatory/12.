Hi,

I wanted to bring these new ISO charges to everyone's intention, so that we=
 could compare them to our EES Master and Confirmation Letter to determine =
whether these costs would be passed through to our EES customers.

As a result of the FERC's June 19 Order, the ISO will be assessing new char=
ges against Scheduling Coordinators.  These charges are for Emission Costs =
and Start-up Fuel Costs incurred by generators in providing energy to the I=
SO under the new "Must Offer" requirements.  The FERC ordered generators to=
 bill the ISO directly for Emission Costs and Start-Up Fuel Costs, and the =
ISO is going to pass these costs through to all SCs, on a pro rata basis, b=
ased on each SC's metered demand in California (both inside and outside the=
 ISO).  See ISO Tariff Sections 2.5.23.3.6 through 2.5.23.3.7.7.    =20

Looking at the EES Master Agreement, the customer has agreed to pay for the=
 following charges:

=09all charges associated with delivering the energy to the utility, includ=
ing ancillary services, uplifts, congestion, losses and other similar charg=
es and =09fees; provided such charges will not duplicate charges in the Spo=
t Energy Price.  In addition, you will be responsible for and pay (without =
=09duplication) all utility distribution and related charges; other charges=
 and surcharges, including the Special Utility Charges and the Special DA =
=09Charges, and any other charges that apply to direct access customers (e.=
g. rate recovery, energy procurement, system reliability, public purpose =
=09and similar types of charges and surcharges); Initial Exit Fees; fees re=
lative to any future return to utility bundled service; and ICAP Charges.

While we could argue that these charges were "other charges that apply to d=
irect access customers. . .e.g., . . .energy procurement," an EES customer =
may argue that it isn't responsible for "energy procurement" charges becaus=
e these charges are also being passed through to utility customers, i.e, th=
ese costs are not assessed on direct access customers only.  For this reaso=
n, I think it is better to characterize these charges as "Special DA Charge=
s."

Under the terms of the EES Master, I believe we can pass the ISO charges fo=
r Emission and Start-Up Fuel Costs through to EES customers as "Special DA =
Charges," which include  "any charges. . . imposed. . . by any Governmental=
 Authority on 'direct access' customers (regardless of whether any such cha=
rge is also imposed on other classes or types of customers [i.e., utility t=
ariff customers---sch]), . . .that are related to. . . charges for system r=
eliability."  These charges are (1) imposed by a Governmental Authority (th=
e ISO), (2) on direct access customers, and (3) are related to "system reli=
ability" because they are incurred by the ISO when the ISO is calling on "M=
ust Offer" generators because of inadequate supply.  Although these charges=
 will be imposed on both direct access customers and customers served by ut=
ilities, the definition of "Special DA Charges" is not limited to charges t=
hat apply to direct access customers only because the "Special DA Charges" =
apply "regardless of whether any such charge is also imposed on other class=
es or types of customers."    See below for the full definition of Special =
DA Charges.
=20
=09=09"Special DA Charges" means any charges, fees, assessments, adders or =
surcharges imposed or authorized by any Governmental Authority on =09"direc=
t =09=09access" customers (regardless of whether any such charge is also im=
posed on other classes or types of customers), however styled or payable, t=
hat =09=09are related to (i) a Utility's, ISO's or Governmental Authority's=
 energy procurement, including, without limitation, charges for system reli=
ability, rate =09=09recovery, future payback of under-collections, amortiza=
tion of above market purchases and energy load repurchases; or (ii) public =
purpose programs, =09=09including, without limitation, environmental, socia=
l/low income, renewable energy utilization, and demand side management =09p=
rograms.  Such charges will =09=09apply regardless of whether the =09energy=
 requirements of the Accounts are being supplied by us or the applicable Ut=
ility.


Also, I don't think the ISO charges would qualify as "Special Utility Charg=
es" because they are not "Utility" charges.=20

=09"Special Utility Charges" means charges by a Utility for services other =
than standard electric service under a tariff of general applicability, =09=
including, without limitation, charges for facilities or equipment rental o=
r for other products or services not generally available to customers of th=
e =09same rate class and type as Customer.

To summarize, I believe the terms of the EES agreement permit us to pass th=
e ISO charges for Emission and Start-Up Fuel Costs through to EES customers=
 as "Special DA Charges.  =20

Any other thoughts or comments?
