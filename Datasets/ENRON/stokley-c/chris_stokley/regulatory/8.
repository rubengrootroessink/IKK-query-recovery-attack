On May 16, FERC rejected the ISO's proposed Amendment 38, which would have suspended the penalty.  FERC said it would look at the issue later.

Are we going to see this money, I thought they had asked FERC to do away with this charge.

$30 million bucks!!!  I would have hoped for 10 times this amount, but it's still 30 million bucks.  Legal and Settlements should get origination credit for this.  Let me know when the ISO's check clears.---Steve
