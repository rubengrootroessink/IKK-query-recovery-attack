Mike,

FYI.

Geir had to buy transmisison from APS for Mirant because their trader didn't know how to and time was drawing too close real time (if no tranny bought, energy would not have gotten to where it should have.)  The date of this transaction was Sat. June 2nd, 2001 (I know the details because I was in the office when it happened.)
We don't have a deal entry function that will allow is to enter a transmission sale deal.  (since we are not a transmission provider and don't sell transmission), so this deal was entered as a purchase annuity for purchase of tranny from APS  @ $3.50 and a sale annuity to Mirant for that tranny @ $7.50.  
I have a feeling we may have to kill the purchase annuity deal and enter it as a transmission purchase but leave the sale annuity to Mirant as is. I'll let you know when I figure it out.

Just FYI.

Virginia


Chris - any suggestions?
