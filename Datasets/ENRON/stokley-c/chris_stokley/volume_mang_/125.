Pete,

I called Glenna and she informed me that they are no longer in Folsom but are in Alhambra.  Apparently an email was sent to you and Chris in regards to this, but I am not on this distribution list.  

The new IP address is 166.49.55.18.  

Chris will need to resend yesterday's Load meter files and I will need to pull the meter files. 

Please Chris or myself a call when you get back in the office so we can get this squared away.

Thanks,

KN

Chris & Kourtney,

I think the ISO Meter system is not working.  I even tried running the Meter Scout manually and the confirmation still times out.

Contact Glenna and find out what is going on. 

 I'm leaving for a funeral this morning so I'll be out of the office and pager range.  You can reach me by cell, 409-656-6219.

Pete
