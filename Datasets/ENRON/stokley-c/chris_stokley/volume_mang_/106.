>
> In our conversation Tuesday, Enron asked about how they should set their
> Pmax rating for a unit, given that they have to overgenerate above their
> Hour Ahead schedule to cover their GMM, and that we might dispatch them
> the difference between Pmax and their HA schedule to comply with the FERC
> order.
>
> Example:
>
> Enron has a 36MW unit that can reliably operate at 31 MW.  Their GMM is
> 0.967, or about 1 MW of losses.  They usually submit an HA schedule of 30
> MW, and generate at 31 MW to cover the GMM.  In this particular case the
> resource is fuel-limited, so that they can't usually generate at their
> maximum output.
>
> The answer from the compliance department is:
>
> A unit should set their P-max at the level that they are capable of
> generating at.  The ISO should be notified immediately if there is an
> outage or de-rate that would prevent the unit from operating at it's
> P-max, otherwise it will be presumed to be available.  A unit that keeps
> the ISO apprised of its availability in real-time and performs in
> accordance with its bid characteristics when dispatched should not receive
> penalties.
> 	A unit with a Final HA Schedule of 30 MW that is dispatched for the
> additional 1 MW and generates 31 MW according to meter data will not be
> penalized under CT 485.  The Total Obligation for CT 485 for a unit that
> is dispatched for Incremental Energy is Final HA Schedule + 90% of
> Instructed Incremental Energy.  The Total Obligation for the hour is
> compared to the hourly meter value for that unit and is not adjusted for
> transmission losses, i.e.. GMM is not taken into account. (Currently,
> penalties for failure to perform are assessed on an hourly basis, however
> CT 485 may be assessed on an interval basis in the future.)  So the Total
> Obligation for the unit is 30 MW + .9 MW ( 90% of 1 MW) = 30.9 MW which is
> less than the meter of 31 MW.  For CT 485 purposes, this unit will not
> receive any penalties.
> 	It is important to note that there is a 10% tolerance or 2 MW for
> Instructed Energy less than 20 MW on CT 485 penalties.  If the unit is
> instructed for less than 20 MW, 2 MW will be taken off of the Instructed
> Incremental Energy instead of 10%.  This means that any unit that has an
> Incremental Instruction for 2 MW or less would not be flagged for CT 485
> review.
> 	For other Settlement charge types such as, CT 401 and No Pay charges
> on Spin, Non-Spin, and Replacement, a unit is required to provide the
> Instructed Energy plus any transmission losses in order to receive full
> credit for providing  the Scheduled Energy and Ancillary Services.
