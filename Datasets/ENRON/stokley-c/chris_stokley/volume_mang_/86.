Dear Settlements,

I'm writing to let you all know that Mike and I are working as quickly as possible on all of your outstanding DMS's.  

This month, we have had 220 new DMS's and unlike in prior months, I have not had Caroline's help to manage the number of DMS's that were entered.  My trip to Houston, as well, put me behind a week with disputes. 

Last week, we brought Mike on board to be fully dedicated to DMS.  (He's doing a great job, so please keep in mind that Mike is still new to DMS.)  Together, we hope to have everyone's DMS's finished in the near future.

Thanks for your understanding.

Virginia

At this time, we ask that you e-mail or call ONLY with absolute URGENT matters.  We will get to everyone's DMS's soon
