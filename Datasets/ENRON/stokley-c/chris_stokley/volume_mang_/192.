Jim, aside from the normal deviation replacement reserves charges, the only
other charges for deviations are Market Services (Charge Type 523) and of
course the Imbalance Energy (CT 401) and Excess Energy, CT 481.

Keoni,

	I realize that there are no penalty charges associated to Load,
I am referring to the neg. and positive load deviation. What are all of
the charges associated to the penalties for deviation from schedule.

	Ps  Jim, take your best cut at what you think these charges are
and then get Keoni too sign off on what results you come up with. We
need to put every charge that we think is linked to a schedule and then
just have Keoni fill in the gaps and sign off on the document.

								Chris

		This is what Keoni says:  See below.  I have placed all
the numbers on the Charge Names and am putting together a list of what
is missing from this document.

		There are no "penalty charges" associated with loads,
just the load
		deviation charges such as replacement reserves.

		This is one request of Chris.  Is he talking about 403
with 111-116?
