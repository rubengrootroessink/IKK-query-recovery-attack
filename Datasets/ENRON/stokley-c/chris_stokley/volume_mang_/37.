Steve,

Attached are the details of the results of our actualization, estimates compared to ISO actuals, for the Import Deviation assessed against SCL schedules in September 2000.  Please note that this does not include any of the transactions for which we have submitted disputes.  I have also included details reflecting our original estimate for these charges.

Please feel free to call me or Chris Stokley if you have any questions.
