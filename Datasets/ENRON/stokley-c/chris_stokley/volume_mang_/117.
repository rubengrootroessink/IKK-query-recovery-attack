Godfrey,

Thank you for your message this morning in regards to the payment made in December.  I would prefer if you outlined the details of the payment in an email, in order for me to clearly understand and be able to explain to my customer what the payment entails.  Also, you mentioned demand charge in your message, could you be more specific to what the various demand charges relate to?  That would be very helpful.

Thank you,

Kourtney
