All, 

On January 1, 2001, the CAISO retired charge type 352 - Wheeling Out/Wheeling Through due ISO.  It was replaced by 382 - High Voltage Wheeling Charge due ISO and 383 - Low Voltage Wheeling Charge due ISO.  The charges are allocated to gross exports (same as before).  The difference is the exit location.  High Voltage Access Charges are accessed for wheeling from transmission facilities with a 200 kV or higher voltage rating, while Low Voltage Access Charges are accessed for wheeling from transmission facilities with a 200kV or lower rating.

Settle 15 has been changed to capture the new wheeling charge types effective 1/1/01.  On the top sheet, Anna added a couple of cells (please see below) and changed the logic to make it date effective. 

WHEELING LV	TRUE	
January 1, 2001	TRUE	

Also on the top sheet, I changed the Wheeling ID for all low voltage tie points to differentiate between the LV and HV charges (please note the change in blue).  

Tie Points	Wheeling	From ZoneTo Zone		
BLYTHE_1_WALC	SCELV	LC2	SP15	
ELDORD_5_MCLLGH	SCE	LA2	SP15	

I've also updated tblRates in the Settle Database and added the charges to FTRflash.  If you have any questions, please ask.
