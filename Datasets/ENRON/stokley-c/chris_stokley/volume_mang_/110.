All,

An error was discovered in SettleGeneration for Charge type 402.  Prior to the change, the rate being pulled was always the Dec, the logic in the formula was incorrect.  Now, when the deviation mw are greater than zero, they are paid the dec and when the deviation mw are less than zero, the are buying the Inc.  This was tested with Caroline and Donna's approval.  The new tool is effective as of now and is properly names in the ISOandPX folder.

Thanks,
Kourtney
