Dear Thresa, Chris, and Mike,

Please find below a composite list of changes and additions that I requested of Mike Self while in Houston.  Please let me know what change requests need to be signed off on before Mike can make any changes.

Thanks, 

Virginia


DMS Changes and additions as discussed on 4-20-01

Reports
 Put desk name and date range at the top of each type of report 

Separate out total negative DPR Impact and total positive DPR Impact and then give net DPR Impact at the end of each report
                                                                                         

Additions  

Add NONE to change type list that shows total DPR impact as "potential DPR impact", but which does not calculate this value into the net DPR impact (as presented in the reports).  For reporting purposes, this field will not be calculated, but simply appear in the report as a net total of disputes "won"
 
Add a field to the form called "Actual Trader" that is to be populated by the VM Coordinator when it has been determined which trader is responsible for the dispute

Add a section that contains 2 fields for who is correct in a dispute and who is wrong in a dispute.  These fields are to be populated by the VM Coordinator when it has been determined whether the EPMI trader or counter-party is correct 

Add "Given to trader" to the status list in the DMS form and put a time stamp that will keep track of how long the dispute was under the status of "given to trader"

Add "Newly revised" to the status list in the DMS form and put a time stamp that will keep track of how long the dispute was under the status of "Newly revised"

Add time stamp to all items in the status list in order to keep track of how long the dispute is in that status: New, pending, closed, given to trader, newly revised


Other

Make a default function that will warn the user if a west delivery point is attached to a DMS that is marked "east" and if an east delivery point is attached to a DMS that is marked "west"
