Julie,

I received your voicemail this morning.  I was out of the office yesterday for training and that training continues today (Wednesday).  I will be back in the office tomorrow and will call you then.  If you have any immediate concerns please contact my manager, Chris Stokley at 503-464-8219.

Thanks,

Kourtney
