Details of Changes:

The changes to SettleSupp were in the rate formula.  The original formula said, :"=IF(AK4>0,Curves!i49,Curves!I42), which means that if the volume in AK4 is greater than zero, use the Inc (I49 reference) price, otherwise use the Dec (I42 reference).  The problem was that the references were backwards, so I switched them to be . . .Curves!I42,Curves!I49.  That made the correct price come in.

This affected the 405 part of SettleSupp only, no other charges were modified.

For 403, the rate formula was "=IF(AK20<0,CURVES!I81,CURVES!i88" which means that if the deviation volume was less than zero, use the Inc, otherwise use the Dec.  I changed it so that it reads . . .(AK20>0,CURVES!i81. . .) so that it would use the Inc if the dev volume is greater than zero.  I confirmed that the dev volume calcs were correct first.

In all of my test runs, both of these changes pulled in the correct Inc or Dec rate, and applied it to the correct dev volume.

There were changes on made on 4/24 to both Settle15 and SettleSupplemental related to the rate calc.  The old versions have been copied off into the Backup directory with today's date, and the new versions have been saved as Settle15_TenMinute.xls and SettleSupplemental.xls.
