Dear Laura,

Just wanted to let you know that the $0 price on Nevada Power deal # 549117.1 is correct.  David Porter gave the following reason:

Monika thought she had purchased APS transmission to wheel from LV Cogen to NEVP, but she hadn't.  I guess this is kind of a bookout at $0 cost to customer.

The NEVP doesn't need to know the reason, just that the price is at $0.

Thanks,

Virginia
