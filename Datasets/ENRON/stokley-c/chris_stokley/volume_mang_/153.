Sean,

The estimated charge for December 2000 DC Line Loss for ECTstNW is approximately $200,000.00. This number was based on the following:

*The total Line Loss at SYLMAR_2_NOB was approximately 1,394 Mw
*ECTstNW's allocation was approximately 920 Mw (66% of the total line loss).  The 66% was derived using ECTstNW's total scheduled exports divided by EPMI's total scheduled exports.
*The rate used was $217.68 which was the average of the incremental price for December 2000.

I've attached a couple of spreadsheets which may be helpful.

You may look forward to the final numbers for December 2000 by May 21. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Donna
