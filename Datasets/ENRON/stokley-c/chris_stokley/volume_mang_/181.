This is what I found:

1) Waheed A. Ahmad of CSC, has records of entering PGES 4/29/01 into Sparky.  Apparently, this did not occur.

2) Pete Davis ran meter scout, and we have confirmations everyday except the 29th.

3) On June 14, Reyes ran both Meter Validation and Schd Vs Meter for several days including the 29th; the lack of data for PGES wasn't picked up.  29th was checked off

4) During April actualization, Anc Charges, and deviation variances for the 29th were not flagged and addressed.

5) Today, 7/17, Chris Stokley calls me and asks why there is no meter in the system.

That is what happened on 4/29.
