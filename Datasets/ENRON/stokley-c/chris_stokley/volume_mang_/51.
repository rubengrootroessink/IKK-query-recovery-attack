Dear Murray (and Chris),

    Mike and I have been noticing that a newcommer in Houston, Alicia Nguyen, may be in need of some additional attention from the Settlements group.  We understand that she had limited training time with Laura Dewett before Laura left the Settlements group, and we recognize that she is not at fault in her mistakes.  This does, however, seem like an issue that needs to be addressed immediately.  
    It does not seem that Alicia knows how to identify real variances or how to then enter the disputes into DMS properly so that we understand what we need to research (and skewing the numbers that I report to our traders) .  Often times, we have found that a problem that she has identified as a dispute is not in duspute, which can be frustrating to us as well and delaying the DMS process.  We think that with some guidance, she will have a much better understanding of the process and be better able to identify real discrepancies. 
   For examples and recommendations, please see Mike or myself.

   We appreciate you attention to this matter,

  Virginia

Virginia,

It seems that Alicia Nguyen in Houston Settlements is not understanding the nature of disputes and the DMS system.  On many occasions we are getting disputes that are not justified when comparing to Enpower.  Alicia may need more training in determining a disputes and how to lay them out on the DMS form.  

Thank you 

Mike Purcell
