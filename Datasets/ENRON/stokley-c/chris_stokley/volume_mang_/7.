Thanks, Melissa.  That clears up most of my questions.  However, on Avista, they inadvertently included their ISO bill with their October bilat transaction invoice, and the full amount was paid.  Their ISO amount was $151,686.52, which, when compared to our actual, is $13,543.24.  They should be invoiced for that amount.

I will let you know when we can schedule a conference call.  I would imagine that all of Volume Management will need to be included in the conversation.

Caroline

Caroline, 

EES & PGES are requiring further research due to intercompany transactions.  It is unclear as to what exactly needs to be reversed, re-booked, etc. until I am able to pull and research 11/00 JV's for 10/00 production.  I am working with EES on these revisions/payments.
Avista will be invoiced the total actual amount, as no one, from what I can see, has been invoiced from our end.  All invoices for counterparties will be going out as soon as we are able to complete the payments requested for 11/00 production.  It is my understanding that the payments for each month are of a higher priority than the invoices...please let us know if that has changed. 
Harbor was paid on 5/23/01 per Chris Foster's 5/21/01 spreadsheet in the amount of $185,631.38.  You may want to comunicate with him any questions you may have.  The ISO piece is included with the Gas and Energy pieces each month.  Their payments for 7/00-9/00 were also processed as such.

Again, please let me know your schedule, and who else you feel should be involved to discuss procedures for these actualizations to ensure they are processed and communicated in the most efficient manner.

Thanks, Melissa

Melissa,

I analyzed this report and have a few questions:

On Avista - Washington Water Power, were they invoiced for the $13,543.24?
On EES, I see a different actual amount than reflected in the report - my number is ($473,206) and this report shows ($707,388.86)? Also, are they invoiced on Estimates?  or should we be paying the actual only, not the difference?  It's not clear to me how they are handled.
On PGES, are they invoiced and do they pay on Estimates? Again, same question as for EES - pay actual or difference?
On Harbor, it says, "net with energy" - need clarification on how and when they will be paid.  Also, I don't show a payment based on estimates, so I show that they should receive the actual of ($192228.39) instead of the ($28,908.39) difference as shown in this report.



Thanks!

Caroline

Caroline, 

Please see the attached file for payments made on 5/21/01 (highlighted in purple.)  All were paid according to the instructions in the email below.  In the future, we will incorporate this step into our process, but I would like to schedule a conference call with you and my coordinator for sometime this week to discuss all procedures related to the settlements of the Cal ISO actualization.  As we have had two different coordinators settling this piece since we last actualized in the summer of 2000, this will probably be beneficial to both groups in ensuring that we are meeting all expectations relating to actualization and invoicing/payments.

Also, in relation to your email regarding 9/00 Actuals, we paid those counterparties that were approved for payment per your email...those that have not been paid were held per those instructions that they required special handling and that we would discuss later.  I will ensure that payment is set-up for tomorrow, 5/23/01 for those mentioned, and will send you a verification via email.

If you have any other questions, please let me know.

Thanks, Melissa

Melissa,

Please send to me within the next hour a list of the customers that were paid and the amounts wired on 5/21/00.  As a part of the normal process, a complete listing with amounts is to be sent to us prior to any funds actually being wired.  This allows us an opportunity to do a final cross-check and ensures accuracy in the payments.

Thank you,

Caroline

Melissa and Sharon,

The final ISO Actualizations for October 2000 have been saved in the CALISO shared folder, and customers can be paid or invoiced according to the remaining amount shown  on the Flash file, except for the following:

Valley Electric
Colorado River Commission - Check with Paul Choi for actual amount to pay them

Please e-mail to me a listing of the anticipated payment amounts per customer prior to issuance of funds so that I may perform a final cross-check.

Thanks,

Caroline Emmert
