Murray and Chris,

Here is an update on what has been completed and what needs to be completed:

First, I moved the Excel "mock up" to P:\VolumeManagement\Settlement Stats

I added Murray's corrections and re-constructed the Mock Report.

In the same directory, you will find an Access Database, "Settlement Analysis DB"  I created a table and a report and a form to create a report.

There is a hard copy of the report at my desk.  

The various connections need to established, and I took a first shot at where the information is stored on the Oracle database.  The reports that I believe will populate the table are FSP_SETLMT_HISTORY_HDRS & FSP_SETLMT_HIST_DTL_QTY .  I have taken a shot at what fields I believe these come from relate to the table.

I need help in populating the tables and then some coaching on how to create a "program" feel to create a report based on selection criteria.

We can meet tomorrow to review where my work is.

Jim
