I have started the actualization process with 403 Load Deviation, and need to work closely with TJ on Monday to find out why the allocations don't match the variances.  I have isolated one day, zone and hour and will work on that with him.  We have got to get it working properly, or else there will be a lot of manual work required.

404 Export Deviation is complete for October, and the records can be set to A with the other days as normal.  

405 Import Deviation needs the new calcs that will be provided by a re-run of SettleSupplemental, which I am going to kick off just before I leave.  I will run that on Monday while TJ is researching the 403 errors/problems.

402 Gen Deviation will also be started on Monday.

Tentative target date for completion of Prelim's is next Thursday, and Finals on Friday.

See you Monday.
