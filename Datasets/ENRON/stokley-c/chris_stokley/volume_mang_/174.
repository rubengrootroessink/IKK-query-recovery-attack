> 1. A/S Soft Caps

> A delta payment will be entered against the applicable A/S charge type for
> capacity bids accepted above the soft cap --- CT 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 51, 52,
> 54, 55 and 56.  The calculation for the delta payment is as follows:
> 	Billable quantity (the automated billable quantity which was paid at
> the MCP price) x the delta price (bid price - MCP).
>
> The A/S soft cap charge will be allocated to participants who had A/S
> obligation using the applicable A/S offset --- CT 111,112,114,115,116.
> The calculation for the A/S soft cap charge is as follows:

>
> Comment detail will include the accepted bid price & total dollars

> 2. Replacement Reserve Capacity or Energy:
>
> An SC will be paid for either Replacement Reserve capacity or Replacement
> Reserve imbalance energy, but not both. The capacity payment will be
> rescinded under CT 4 & 54 and credited back to the market under CT 114
> based on net obligation.   The calculation for the payment recission is as
> follows:
> 	Billable quantity for payment rescission (minimum of hourly ERR
> Prime or CT4 billable quantity + CT54 billable quantity ) x price (if an
> SC was paid for DA capacity & HA capacity, then price = CT4 Settlment
> Amount + CT54 Settlement Amount / [CT4 billable quantity + CT54 billable
> quantity] {this is a weighted average price}; otherwise, price = MCP.

> Comment detail will include total dollars allocated.
