Melissa,

I have a question in regards to the handling of Harbor's ISO numbers with the recent payments made to them.  Were the ISO numbers included in the payment, netting against any revenues and charges in the system through Enpower?  Or were these handled in a different manner?  I just want to make sure that I have an understanding of how they were handled.

Thank you,

Kourtney
