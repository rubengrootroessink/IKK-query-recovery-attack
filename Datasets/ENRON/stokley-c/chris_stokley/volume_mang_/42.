Continue to have difficulties matching up volumes for Import Deviation, caused by an internal database functionality problem.  

Have analyzed the Instructed/Uninstructed settlement data provided by the ISO and created formulas for variance identification and allocation for all types of deviation, as well as special case handling (exceptions or export deviation for example).  Also looking into Region differences and working with Anna on how to incorporate region into the process.

Anna has added the functionality to be able to actualize by settlement file SeqID, but this needs to be tested (settlement database crash prohibited proper testing today).

Reviewed TJ's functionality for allocating dollar variances in Total 407 (after volumetric and related dollar variances are allocated, remaining dollar variances are applied to ECTstCA); provided feedback on same.

Need to accomplish the following  to wrap-up September:

Review formulas currently in database - revise if needed
Test formulas
Obtain valid allocations for variances (especially for 405)
Check results on new allocations for 402, 403 and 404 to see if formula changes made any difference, and if so, is difference good
Delete existing allocations (based on current formulas, may be invalid)
Send new allocations up to FSP
Run total 407
Re-run whole process for Finals
Finish Final actualizations (Brett left off at the 19th)

Anticipate completion of deviation stuff for Prelims complete by end of week, and finals by Tuesday next.
