Scotty,
    Below is all of the emails between Bob Buckingham (LP), and Godfrey (Houston settlements).  This is entirely unacceptable how Godfrey and Settlements ignored this.  Bob has been waiting for three months on a resolution to a six month old issue.  Bob should have been notified by Melissa Ratnala of Godfrey's departure and the account should have been handed off to someone else.  I will be forwarding this to Melissa and ask her to address it immediately.  I am copying everyone in the group who deals with settlements to keep them informed.  The Houston Settlements saga continues.
-Kit

Can you guys assist me by having the appropriate Enron person contact Bob Buckingham of L-P.  I can not seem to locate Godfrey Hyde on our internal directory.  Thanks,  John

John,
We're having a difficult time resolving a discrepancy with Enron on our February billing (we were overcharged $8,300).  I've forwarded several requests to Godfrey Hyde (Houston) with little or no response.  Also, we have not done July's "check out" as of this date.  Godfrey has been the individual of late that has usually contacted me and taken care of that.  Technically that means that Enron is unable to invoice us for July, until that is done.
 
Can you shed some light on the issue(s).  Is Godfrey still handling LP from an accounting standpoint? I'm including the pertinent e-mails to date.
 
Thanks,
 
Bob Buckingham

Godfrey, (Enron)
It's been nearly six months since the February billing error and three months since we began investigation of it.  Is there a problem in us being able to resolve this one way or the other?  Please advise me ASAP of your progress or actions to know if we need to get others involved.  Also, I've yet to hear from you on July's "check out" for our Missoula facility.  I'm assuming you guys want to bill us some time soon.  Please contact me at my new number below on both of the above issues.

Godfrey,
It's been almost a month and we're not hearing anything back from Enron on this billing descrepancy.  Can you please advise me of the investigation status and findings?
 
Thank you,

Subject: Louisiana-Pacific Missoula - Descrepancy in February 01 Billing


Godfrey, (Enron)    
Per our phone conversation of today, we've discovered a potential overcharge situation in our February '01 settlement numbers for this location.
 
Enron billed us as follows:
4,590 total MWhs sold Enron to LP (@ $48 - $220,320)
288 total MWhs sold back LP to Enron (@ $177.74 = $51,189.73)
That adds up to total MWhs for the month of February: 4,878
 
The descrepancy occurs when you verify the total available MWhs for the month was only 4,704 (7MW x 24hrs x 28 days)
If I'm correct, that means we were overcharged for 174 MWhs @ $48/MW or $8,352.
 
Please investigate this potential error and advise me of your findings.
 
Thank you,
 
Bob Buckingham
