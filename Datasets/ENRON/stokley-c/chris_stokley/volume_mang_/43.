Steve,

Here are the comparisons that I ran for September for both energy and capacity payments between the estimate sheets that SCL is using, and the actuals received by the ISO.  I also have provided explanations for the differences between the two.   Please call me this morning (before 9 or after 10, please) if you need to discuss this further.
