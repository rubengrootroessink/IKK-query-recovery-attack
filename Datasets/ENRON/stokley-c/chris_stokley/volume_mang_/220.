Hello All,

	I want to give you an update about where we are with January actualizations, and going forward.  Currently, charge type 523, a grid management charge, is proving very difficult to allocate given the limited information the CAISO is currently giving us.  If you want specific detail regarding this feel free to talk to myself or Caroline.  Our deadline has currently been the second week of this month to have through March completed.  Given where we are today, which is half-way through January, this deadline is probably unrealistic.  Further progress depends entirely on being able to reconfigure our tools to allocate this charge type.  It is unknown at this point how long that will take.  I plan to keep you up to date where we are so there are no surprises.  We will have a better idea in a few days when we will be finished.  Again, please talk to myself or Caroline should have any questions.

-Kit Blair
