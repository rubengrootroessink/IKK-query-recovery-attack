All,

These two tools have been saved over as Production, and are now called, "SettleSupplemental.xls" and "FTRflash.xls" - the original files have been copied into the Backup folder.

Hi All,

Anna has made changes to these tools in the following manner:

SettleSupplemental.xls - Removed all references to calculations of 407

FTRFlash - Added new tab that shows the Total EPMI 407 Deviation position, as well as adding Intervals to the DetailData.

When all have tested and approved the changes, Anna will save them over as our Production tools.

Caroline
