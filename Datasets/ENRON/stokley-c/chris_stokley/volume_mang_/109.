Kourtney, 

The ISO numbers were included in the payment per the attached schedule from Chris.  My apologies for waiting so long to reply back to you, I have been in and out of the office this week.  If you have any other questions, please let me know.

Thanks, Melissa

Melissa,

I have a question in regards to the handling of Harbor's ISO numbers with the recent payments made to them.  Were the ISO numbers included in the payment, netting against any revenues and charges in the system through Enpower?  Or were these handled in a different manner?  I just want to make sure that I have an understanding of how they were handled.

Thank you,

Kourtney
