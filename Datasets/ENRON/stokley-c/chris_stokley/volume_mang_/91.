Dear Bill,

  If I remember correctly, you will be having a real-time trader meeting tomorrow.  
We were wondering if you thought it might be beneficial for Mike, Donna, and I to formally introduce ourselves (especially to the 4 new guys) at the end of your meeting and to address a few items of importance and how they affect EPMI getting paid (California, El Paso, MPC, tranny charges, and traders' logs).  Please let us know if you think our input might be useful.

Thanks,

Virginia
