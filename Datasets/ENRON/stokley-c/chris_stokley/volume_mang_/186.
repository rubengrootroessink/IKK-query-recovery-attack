I discovered this error, and had Pat send us an e-mail explaining the reason the Meter was wrong as well as updating the data.  They updated this within the 45 days.

Subject: Settlement Files 5/26 and 5/28


Jim, the above settlement files were misstated due to an error in tracking
weekend vs weekdays. The original file showed the data for 5/26 to be a
normal load for a weekday while 5/28 reflected the load for a weekend.
The problem has been corrected and the files for 5/26 and 5/28 were
reposted.  The file for 5/26 was reposted on 7/17, day 45.
