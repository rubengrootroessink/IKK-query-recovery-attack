All,

At the conclusion of yesterday's meeting, I felt there was still some room for us to clarify the situation with Harbor.  I have summarized below what the Volume Management team concluded the process will be on a go-forward basis (starting in May):

1)  On the 2nd to last business day, Chris Foster will enter two annuities for the gas transaction.  The 1st annuity is for the West Gas to sell to West Services and the 2nd annuity is for West Services to sell to Harbor.  The amount of this annuity is based on the most current number Vivan Chen provides Chris and has zero financial affect on the WestServices book.

2)  On the last business day of the month, Risk calcs the month's transactions taking into account the gas annuities and the Forward power (deals which are entered on a daily basis).  Also included is the ISO Actualization for a prior month as well as an annuity entered by Chris Foster to account for the West Services shared savings for this prior month.
	-this shared savings calc is from a spreadsheet that takes into account all the costs that Harbor informs Chris Foster of 	and will never be a loss to the West Services book	

3)  20th of following month, update both gas annuities by production month

4)  25th of following month, send 2 separate invoices/payments sent to Harbor for 1) gas and 2) forward power.


For the clean-up of months prior, Chris Foster and Kourtney will go over the July through September spreadsheets in order to determine the deal entry and clean-up that needs to occur.

Please respond to all with additional comments/ammendments.

Thanks,

Kourtney
