Pete,

Chris Stokley called me regarding Meter data on 4/29 for PGES.  What we received from the ISO does not include meter in our data base, yet below you can see there was meter for PGES.  

We ran the schedule to meter report, and the data is missing from this report.

I will also find the e-mails reporting sending this to the ISO.  We need to determine what part of the process broke down keeping the data from being reported.

Jim
