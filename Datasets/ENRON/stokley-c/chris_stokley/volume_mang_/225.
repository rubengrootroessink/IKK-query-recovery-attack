Ola Mr. Stokley,
	I spoke with Les Rawson today, and he met with El Paso last week.  He said they are "really nervous," about how much money they owe us for underbilling of PX losses.  The believe it is at a minimum half a million, maybe more.  Could you forward to me any information or data regarding what we charged them, and what they still owe us?  Let me know if I can help at all, I know you are very busy.  Sweet.  Peace out.
