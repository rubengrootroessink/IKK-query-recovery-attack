Hi,

The Preliminary and Final Actualizations for November 2000 ISO transactions have been completed.  A Flash file has been saved in the CALISO shared folder as "1100 Settlements Final ISO_051701.xls."  This file reflects the total amount of settlement, as well as the amounts to pay or invoice based on the short-pay amount that the ISO actually paid to EPMI.  This amount will be found in column G under "New Settlement."  The amounts in column H, "Short Pay," represent the amount that we did not receive from the ISO; an accrual needs to be put in the system to account for this unpaid amount.

Please feel free to call me or Murray O'Neil if you have any questions regarding this file.

Caroline
