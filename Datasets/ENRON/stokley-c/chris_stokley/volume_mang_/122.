Anna,

I just left you a message, but thought I would outline the problem that arose.  We are running the CustomerReport_update tool for the month of April for each of the generation customers.  Upon running Wheelabrat, we found that the meter is not dumping after HE 2 on April 1.  The query that pulls the meter is in the Settle database and is called "qryGenCustMeter" and when I ran it, I came back with no data.  My guess is that it all goes back to the DLS time issue.  I've looked at it as much as I could and don't know what to do to fix it.  I'm a little confused b/c you fixed a DLS time issue earlier in the month and I ran it w/out this problem.

Let me know what else you need from me.

Thanks,

Kourtney
