Pat,

I have been reviewing the Meter Vs. Load Validation Report we use to keep an eye on Load Schedule vs. Meter Data.

I have been running these reports daily since 4/1/01.  We have found the following information missing from the reports from 4/1-4/9.

All the missing information is for PGES

1) Zone MID1 and SMD1 is missing both Load Sch. and Meter
2) Zone PGE1, PGE2, PGE4 are missing Meter Data

Due to all the issues we have been experiencing lately, we want to make sure that all the data is complete.  Could you let me know via
e-mail, what you know about these zones, and why we are missing this data.

Thank you.

Jim
