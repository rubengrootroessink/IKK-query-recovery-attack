Dear Laura and Alicia,

Could you guys spend a few minutes reviewing how to enter DMS's, as Mike and I have found 6 or 7 that are entered so confusingly that it takes us a longer time to figure out what the dispute is than it takes us to actually solve it.  

Please also remember that ALL DMS's that are not Counterparty changes should have a DPR impact.  All of the DMS's that I have done with your name on them this week have had a $0 Impact, when, in fact, there is a very large impact.

Thank You,

Virginia and Mike
