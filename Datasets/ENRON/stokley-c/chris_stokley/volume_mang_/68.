Jes,

Can you please let me know what steps have been taken to improve the disputes we are having with EES?  After speaking with our settlements coordinator in Houston, we both think that 80% of the problems are on our Portland side.  Is there a better process that we can impose that will help us to make less technical errors (especially when sending EES our spreadsheets)?  

Just wondering so I know what to expect.

Thank you,

VA
