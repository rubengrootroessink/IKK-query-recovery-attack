Anna,

I ran SettleGen for 4/1 and 4/2.  These appeared to return meter data in correct form.  I then ran SettleGen for 4/23-25 and these are the results I received:

4/23/01:  HE 1 = meter data
	  HE 2-24 = 0

4/24/01: HE 1= 0
	 HE 2-24 = meter data

4/25/01: HE 1 = meter data
	 HE 2-24 = 0

I understand that with the Daylight savings, there is a one hour shift, thus explaining the HE 2 on 4/23 finishing HE 1 on 4/24. I confirmed that there is meter data available for 4/23 & 4/24.  There is no meter available for 4/25 (that's another issue).  It seems that the pull is skipping a whole day.  

One other thing that I checked:
I pulled meter from the Settledb from qyrMeterDstGen_Interval for 4/24 and ran SettleGen for 4/24.  The qyr meter data HE 1-23 is equal to the SettleGen data for HE 2-24.  

If you could please call me at your earliest convenience so we can get this taken care of today if possible.

THANK YOU ANNA!!!

Kourtney
