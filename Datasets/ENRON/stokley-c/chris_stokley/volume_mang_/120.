Chris,

I believe that you know what things have come up in our dealings with Godfrey, but I wanted to reiterate them via email.

-We send out wires on the 25th for each of the generators energy payments from the prior month.  I sent an email to Audrey and Godfrey stating the amounts to be paid on the 13th.  Normal procedure is for Audrey to send an email to each of the customers prior to the wire in order for their A/R to prepare for them.  Audrey gave Godfrey the contact list that I had created for her.  Godfrey sent emails to customers on the 24th, but there were two emails that went to wrong customers.   Thus payment amounts were given to wrong customers.  I believe that this was due to a tech person working on his email but obviously not something to be repeated next month.

This is the major dealing that I have had thus far w/ Godfrey.  He has always been really concerned about getting things right when I've talked with him.  So I think that he really wants to do a good job but he just really does not have enough knowledge yet to do a good job.  

I will be working w/ Chris Foster to pay Harbor for July, August and September activity.  I will let you know how that goes.

KN
