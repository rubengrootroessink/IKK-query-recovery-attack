FYI-

  As of June 2001, Portland General Electric's Enpower name has been changed from PORTLAND to PORTLANDGE.  
  You can pull CARPs for both counterparties, but if you enter deals, only PORTLANDGE is active.
  This will make a difference for anyone true-ing up months prior to June 1, 2001 by entering the deals into the system after June 1, 2001, as the information will fall under 2 counterparties and will have to be merged in Excel.  

  Please ask me if you have any questions.

  Thanks,

  Virginia
