Chris and Murray,

To reiterate the story, Phil Tuohy needs access to Wheelabrator Shasta and Martel unit information.  He is able to access Shasta's information but not Martel's information.  When he goes to the Enronwest website, he sees the two counterparty names "WheelSHAST" and "Wheelabrator Settlements" (the second is Martel's info) but the "Wheelabrator Settlements" gives him an error.  I first approached Allen about this in the beginning of December and sent an email with the details on December 7th.  This email is below.  I then followed up with another email Jan 24th describing two different issues with the enronwest site.  Allen called with an answer to one of the problems, but did not address the second issue--which was Phil's issue.  This email is also below.  I do not believe that Allen was able to replicate Phil's error, but I do not know how much further he looked into the issue.

Phil Tuohy called this morning and is frustrated that he can only receive the Martel information via emails that I send.  He sees the Wheelabrator/Enron relationship continuing indefinitely and needs timely access to the data.  I told him that I would elevate this issue to my manager in order to get an answer for him.  Let me know what else you need from me.

Thanks,
Kourtney

Allen,

Talked to Phil at Wheelabrator.  His browser is AOL version 4.0.  But he made a good point--
if he can see WheelSHAST with this browser, shouldn't he be able to see Wheelabrat Settlements?

When he clicks on Wheelabrat Settlements, this is the URL address that pops up:

eel.enronwest.com/goPage.asp?url=/settlements/settlementlist.asp?/Wheelabrat

But when I log on as him and click on Wheelabrat settlements, I get this URL address:

http://eel.enronwest.com/settlements/settlementlist.asp?/Wheelabrat

The URL he sees matches the one that we use in Lotus Notes workspace for setting up the accounts.  

So obviously it is sending him to the wrong address.  

His name is Phil Tuohy at (863) 665-2255 x112 if you would like to ask him any questions directly.

Thank you for you help on this,

Kourtney

Also, Heather logged on as Phil Tuohy (WheelSHAST) on an outside analog line and could see both the "WheelSHAST" and "Wheelabrator Settlements."  She also logged in as Fabi Mendez (Arco) and she could see the customer information.

If you could please see where the problems may lay, I would greatly appreciate it.  I have dealt with some very frustrated customers and would really like to be able to serve them better.  If there is anything else you need from me or the customers, please let me know.  This is an issue I would like resolved as soon as possible.  Thank you Allen and enjoy the long weekend.
