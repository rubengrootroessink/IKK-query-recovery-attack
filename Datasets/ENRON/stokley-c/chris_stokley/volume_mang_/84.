Dear Chris,

Just a reminder that I will need 1/2 of a personal day this Wednesday 5-2-01.  I'll be in the office until about noon.

My mother's graduation is this weekend also, so I was wondering if it is OK that I will not be in the office on Monday 5--7-01, as I will be in Atlanta over the weekend.

Please let me know if there is anything that you need from me before that time.

Thanks,

Virginia

Dear Chris,

This e-mail is to let you know that I will need to be out of the office on a personal matter for part or all of the day on Wednesday, May 2, 2001.  

I will also be in attendance of my sister's graduation in Massachusetts from May 25, 2001 thru May 29, 2001 , returning to work on Wednesday, May 30, 2001.  (That is Labor Day weekend, so I will miss only 2 business days)

Please let me know if there is anything I can prepare for you before that time.

Thanks,

Virginia
