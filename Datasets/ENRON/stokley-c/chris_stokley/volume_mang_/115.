Kent,

I received your voicemail this morning.  I was out of the office yesterday for training and that training continues today (Wednesday).  

The file has been saved out on the Enronwest website in the Estimate folder for April.  If you have any specific concerns, I will be back in the office tomorrow and would be happy to go over those at that time.  If you have any immediate concerns please contact my manager, Chris Stokley at 503-464-8219.

Thanks,

Kourtney
