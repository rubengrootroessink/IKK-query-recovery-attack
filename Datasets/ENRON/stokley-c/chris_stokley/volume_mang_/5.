Melissa,

This looks fine.   Paul Choi will again be offsetting any payments to Valley Electric, so no physical payment will be sent to them.

Just as a final cross-check to make sure we are all operating under the same understanding for Willamette, they have been paid the full amount plus an overage of $25.  They will not be receiving any additional funds on 5/31, nor will they be charged for the overage.  The amount overpaid to them will be included  in the entry for ECTstCA.  Is that your understanding as well?

Other than that, payments listed in your spreadsheet are good to go. 

Please let me know when the payments are actually released.

Thanks!

Caroline

Caroline, 

Please see the attached file for amounts scheduled to pay on 5/31/01 (highlighted in yellow.)  We will not actually be releasing these payments until we have final verification from you.

Thank you, Melissa

Hi,

The Preliminary and Final Actualizations for November 2000 ISO transactions have been completed.  A Flash file has been saved in the CALISO shared folder as "1100 Settlements Final ISO_051701.xls."  This file reflects the total amount of settlement, as well as the amounts to pay or invoice based on the short-pay amount that the ISO actually paid to EPMI.  This amount will be found in column G under "New Settlement."  The amounts in column H, "Short Pay," represent the amount that we did not receive from the ISO; an accrual needs to be put in the system to account for this unpaid amount.

Please feel free to call me or Murray O'Neil if you have any questions regarding this file.

Caroline
