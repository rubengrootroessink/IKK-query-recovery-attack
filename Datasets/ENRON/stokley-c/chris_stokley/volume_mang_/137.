Anna, 

I am missing some manual entries that I made.  For 12/8/00, I made some manual entries for Willamette and I see them in the Del do not open qyr for Trans type D and E, but not for C.  I was under the impression, that EPMIM's could be saved as D's, E's etc, but that they would always stay as a C.  I also see the same problem for ECTRT on 12/11/00.    

Please let me know how I should proceed or if there is anything else you need from me--or if I should contact someone else??

Thanks,

Kourtney
