Hi Chris,

Look at the file called Flash_06_01_2000 EES.xls.  It is saved in the directory I told you O:Portland/Westdesk/VM/VM/Jim/EES Monthly  I created a pivot table and a formula  to separate Peak from Off Peak on the flash...Look it over, it covers June 2000 and July 2000.

If this is some thing you want, it takes about 15 min per spreadsheet.  Let me know 1) if you want this kind of analysis and 2) what months and in what order you want.

Jim
