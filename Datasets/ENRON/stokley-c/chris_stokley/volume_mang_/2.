Melissa,

This looks fine.  We will let you know when payments can be released for the ones on hold per the traders.  

Amounts for Valley for September - December have been provided to Alicia for inclusion in their April billing.

For Harbor, we will be netting the amount owed to us with all of the rest of their December transactions (gas, and day ahead energy), leaving an amount owed to Harbor of $(2,843.58).  The Gas amount = $616,304.42; Day Ahead energy = ($680,400).  The ISO amount is $61,251.  The net of these three amounts is the amount due.  Please confirm that you are seeing these values in the system.

Caroline

Caroline, 

Please see the attached schedule for Dec payments...please note that we show a payment for the Williamette estimate on 5/7/01 so we will only be paying the adjustment.  Please let me know if you agree with this...Upon your approval, we will release the payments for Thursday, June 7.

Thank you, Melissa
