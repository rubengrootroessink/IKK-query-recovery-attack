Pete/Dave,

I'm not sure who needs to take care of this, but here is the issue:

On Friday, 4/6/01, the RT group did SC trades with APX3.  This is not a counterparty in CAPS, thus they entered the deals through workspace.  Thus, it was not captured in CAPS and my Enpower/CAPS report is off by this exact amount (212mw).  

The trades were:  

HE 15-22: 21mw
HE 19: 15mw
HE 20: 14mw
HE21: 15mw

Could APX3 please be added to CAPS so we can create these SC trades.  I don't mind helping do the manual work, please advise as to how I should proceed.

Thanks guys!

Kourtney
