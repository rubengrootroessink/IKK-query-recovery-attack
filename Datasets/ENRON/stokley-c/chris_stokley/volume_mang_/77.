Dear Alicia,

I received your fax today for detail on PGE.

I need you to go through it and highlight the discrepancies and put them into DMS.  

The systems that you have in place should allow you to identify the variances rather quickly.

Maybe Laura or Thresa could show you how to put them in the DMS system.

Please call me with any questions you have. I'll work on the DMS discrepancies as soon as I receive them.

Thanks,

Virginia
