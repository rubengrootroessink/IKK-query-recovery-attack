Dear Amy,

Please have a look at DMS # 7706 for an AEPC deal.
You wrote the following comment in DMS:   "Deal came through after 1st workday.  We are missing this deal.  They say the downstream is Southern Cal. Edison - there is one deal for SoCal on this day #461072.1 - but it is not routed in scheduling?"

When I looked a the deal ticket,, the deal was entered on 3-12-01, which is the day before the deal flowed.  

We are wondering why, if the deal was entered before it took place, is it just now comming thru after April 1, 2001?   Is there a chance that it was paid in March and then again in April?  

Please inform.

Thanks,

Virginia
