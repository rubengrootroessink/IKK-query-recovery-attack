We have all but the last of the exceptions actualized for 405.  TJ is writing code to take the customer search up to the day level and automatically allocate these records.  There is one day with a 35MW difference between the variance and the allocations - I will chase that down and fix it in the morning.

I have the last of the numbers ready to send to Seattle, showing the breakout between us and them.  There was a swing of about 104k in Import Deviation - we estimated a charge of about 15k, and the final actualization shows a credit of approximately 88k.  Of that credit, roughly 84k belongs to Seattle.  I will e-mail the document to Steve in the morning.

Once the 405's are fully actualized, we will transfer them to Oracle, set them to A, then run the Total 407 process (allocates remaining dollar variances to ECTstCA) for Prelims.  Set the newest actualizations to A, run a Flash and do the last cross-check to the Invoice.

For Finals, we have seven days to run through the actualization process, then transfer to Oracle, set to M, and run a Final flash.  We will then be able to provide details to Houston Settlements.

Anticipate completion of Preliminaries and Finals by mid-Thursday.

Charge types 402, 403 and 404 have been fully re-allocated and are set to A.  

Finals for the regular stuff have been completed; incomplete actualization found for 9/5 and will need to be re-run on Monday.  Data had not been set to M as the allocations were not correct.  Did not discuss the date with Brett.

Charge type 405 (Import Deviation) is being re-run, with exceptions created that will require manual allocations.  The volume is still not allocating properly and research must be done to determine what is causing the bad allocations.  I may need some help looking at the data, if help can be found.

What is outstanding for Prelim actualization:
Finish 405 allocations, upload to Oracle, and set them to A.
Run Total 407 to assign remaining dollar variances to ECTstCA.
Run entire process, comparing A's to F's for Finals
Upload Finals to Oracle and set to M
Re-run 9/5 Final
Run Flash reports for A and M to double-check a match to the Invoices.

Still shooting for a COB Tuesday for all.

We have transferred new allocations for Gen and Export Dev based on the changes to the formula that I gave to TJ.  Tomorrow we will work on redoing Load Dev using the same formula changes, then we need to finish researching whatever is wrong with Import Deviation and get that one done.  

Once all four are done and transferred, then we can do the Total 407 part, which will identify remaining dollar variances and allocate that amount to ECTstCA.  The code hasn't been fully tested yet, so completion of this part may be delayed until cob Monday.

I am finished with September Finals for the non-deviation stuff through the 28th, and will have the last two days done tomorrow morning.

I anticipate having all of September completely actualized (for both Preliminary and Final) by cob Tuesday.

TJ looking into the formulas, with Anna's assistance as best she can by telephone and IM.  We had to dump the existing export deviation records and re-do the manuals that had been previously added incorrectly, so that type will have to be run through the process again for sure.

No additional progress on any of the other things that need to be done for September, with the exception of 3 days worth of Finals actualized without deviations.

Tomorrow is another day, and if Anna is back we'll get that much closer to completion of Prelims by weeks' end.  At least we didn't have a database crash today.

Continue to have difficulties matching up volumes for Import Deviation, caused by an internal database functionality problem.  

Have analyzed the Instructed/Uninstructed settlement data provided by the ISO and created formulas for variance identification and allocation for all types of deviation, as well as special case handling (exceptions or export deviation for example).  Also looking into Region differences and working with Anna on how to incorporate region into the process.

Anna has added the functionality to be able to actualize by settlement file SeqID, but this needs to be tested (settlement database crash prohibited proper testing today).

Reviewed TJ's functionality for allocating dollar variances in Total 407 (after volumetric and related dollar variances are allocated, remaining dollar variances are applied to ECTstCA); provided feedback on same.

Need to accomplish the following  to wrap-up September:

Review formulas currently in database - revise if needed
Test formulas
Obtain valid allocations for variances (especially for 405)
Check results on new allocations for 402, 403 and 404 to see if formula changes made any difference, and if so, is difference good
Delete existing allocations (based on current formulas, may be invalid)
Send new allocations up to FSP
Run total 407
Re-run whole process for Finals
Finish Final actualizations (Brett left off at the 19th)

Anticipate completion of deviation stuff for Prelims complete by end of week, and finals by Tuesday next.
