Sharon,

Please talk with Godfrey about the payment to Saguaro, as a couple of weeks ago he worked with Les Rawson to arrange a payment to them, and the ISO capacity payment was included in that amount.

You are correct on the SCL payment, and I have revised the actualized file to reflect it.

Thanks for checking.

Caroline

Caroline:

Upon review of October ISO revised activity, we have found the following discrepancies:

1.  The amount of 3,025.52 for Saguaro has been listed as an amount settled on estimate, but we show no such payment
     having transpired.
2.  We show payment of 2,050.00 for SCL on Feb. 20, 2001 by Ck No. 2000075016 but do not see the amount listed on
     your revised copy of the EPMI ISO customers for 10/00.                                                     

Please review and advise on these descrepancies.

We will make payment, with the exception of Valley Electric as per your instructions, on May 17, 2001 or May 18, 2001 depending on the journal entry booking, and will advise you of the final payment date as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Sharon
