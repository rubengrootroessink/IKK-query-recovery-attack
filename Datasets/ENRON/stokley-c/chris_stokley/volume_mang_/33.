All,

Clarification on new findings statements below:  trading minute and trade
interval are the same thing.  So,

  -- If an  exception occurs at trading minute level, the volume usage at
trade hour level is used to do pro-rata
  -- If an  exception occurs at trading hour level, the volume usage at
trade date level  is used to do pro-rata
