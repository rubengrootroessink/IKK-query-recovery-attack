The underscheduling of load penalties are not in effect.  For exports there
are no penalties for deviations.

Keoni,

As our group has researched all of these new Out of Market charges, we
have yet to see charges tied back to strictly to exports.  The Soft Cap
Pmt/Allocation charges (481/487) are based on underscheduled load and
overscheduled generation.  CT 485 relates only to generators.

The Underscheduled Load Penalty/Revenue charges (480/1480) apply to
total load plus exports if there is a variance by more than 95%.  For
our non-load customers, this would most likely only occur if the export
schedule is cut.  The alternate way this might happen is if EPMI
decreases load and exports the power.

Are there any other OOM penalties that we are missing?  Specifically any
relating to exports.

I know how fun these things are to sort through, thank you for your
help.
