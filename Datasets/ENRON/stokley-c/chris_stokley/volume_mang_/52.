Dear Thresa,

  I'm writing to follow up on our phone conversation of last week regarding the document I put together to help Houston Settlements in the researching disputes.  
I know that you and Melissa have been busy, so I was wondering if you had yet had a chance to talk with her and the Houston VM group about it, as I hoped to get it into production this week.  Please let me know your thoughts or suggestions.

 Thanks,

  Virginia
