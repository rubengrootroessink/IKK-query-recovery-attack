Anna made a change to SettleSupplemental today to accurately reflect the sign convention for dollar amounts for Import Deviation.  The tool was calculating payments where there should have been a charge, and vice versa.   I compared hourly values for both volume and amount between a new caclulation with the volume and expected amount result in the ISO IE table and it is reflecting them both with the correct sign convention.
