Check out the last couple of tabs.  I will try and find more info that
actually describes this terminology.

Hi Keoni,

Would you please clarify zones for me.

Here's what I think:

Congestion Zones are - NP15, SP15, SF HUMB, ZP26
Load Zones are - PGE1, PGE2, PGE3, PGE4, SCE1, SDG1
Tie Point - SYLMAR_2_NOB
Location ID -  ?
Resource ID - ?
Branch Group - PATH26_BG

Please provide examples of each and when they would be used (What charge
types).  I tried looking in the glossary on your web-site and wasn't
able to find everything.  Is there someplace else I could look.  I also
reviewed the settlements manual and was unable to clearly answer my
questions.

Thanks for any help you are able to provide,
Donna
