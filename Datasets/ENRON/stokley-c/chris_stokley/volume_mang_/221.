Chris,
    Could you please look at this?  We are trying to determine if we should pay this or not.  It appears we withheld payment from CDWR because of the PX short payment.  Do we need to call CDWR and tell them we are not going to pay until we collect from the PX?  Amy Clemons keeps talking about an annuity that needs to put in Enpower.  Stuart seems to have no idea what to do.  In any case, I am not sure what to do with this, can you shed some light on it.  Word.
 
-Kit

Stewart, I would like to come to an agreement on November and December payments.  The situation to date re the sharing agreement:
 
CDWR November Profit    $1,025,958.32
EPMI Paid CDWR                606,753.73
 
December Short Pay         $ 419,204.59    from EPMI's records
 
Edgar Najera of CDWR invoiced EPMI for $189,148.33 for the month of December 2000.  In addition, EPMI owes CDWR $20,500 for 82 MWs x $250/mw for HE 2200 on December 6, 2000.  CDWR delivered 275 MWs to EPMI in NP15; EPMI delivered 193 MWs to CDWR in SP15.  Total owed CDWR = $209,648.33.
 
What is the status of the December payment at this point?  The last phone conversation I had with you you indicated the $209,648.33 did not include any short pay for December.
 
Will you please get back to me and let me know what is needed to complete the November/December transactions?
