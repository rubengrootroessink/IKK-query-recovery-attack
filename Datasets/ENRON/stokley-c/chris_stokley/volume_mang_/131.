Chris, 

This is the activity I was telling you about last week, it is on May 10th.  Let's chat about this when you get a chance.

Also, my planned vacation this summer is:

June 27-29
July 5-6

We can figure out who will help with Flash/Month End once we bring the new people up to speed.

Thanks,

KN

Kourtney-

How would you like to come join us in beautiful California for our annual Energy
Day and represent Enron?  So what is Energy Day........

This is our 5th year of putting on it and it's getting bigger and better each
year.  We invite over 1700 kids (6th, 7th, and 8th graders) from three counties
to spend a day learning about every aspect of energy.  Because of the "energy
crisis", we have had a tremendous response.  Adults, as well as the kids, are
extremely interested in learning about what is going on the California.  We
expect this year to be the largest ever.

Our plant is transformed into an "Energy Carnival".  The kids play Energy
Jeopardy, Wheel of Fortune, Crossword, Word Relay, Bingo, etc...all with
questions designed to teach the kids about electricity.  We also have vendor
alley where kids are introduced to solar, wind, geothermal, and hydro companies.
Of course, we would like the natural gas industry to be represented as well.  We
are currently working to get as many vendors as possible so the kids have any
array of booths to learn from.  To add to the event, we have a presentation by
the "Fire Guy".  This is a 20 minute presentation which has proven to be the
highlight of the day.  Lastly, we have a huge BBQ to feed all the kids.  We
prepare hamburgers, and Pepsi sponsors the drinks.  Needless to say this is
quite an event.

We would love to have you come.  It's actually fun for the adults too -
especially if we have good weather.  Let me know what you think, or if I should
be contacting someone else.

Talk with you soon-

Sophia
