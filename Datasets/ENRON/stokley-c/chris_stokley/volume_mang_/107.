Our folks are continuing to review all the questions. However, below is a
section that been has responded to:

> 3.	On any Day, if the Must Offer Generator cannot generate the full
> PMax it must file a generation outage report, in the form of Attachment 2,
> to the CAISO.  Otherwise the full PMax is deemed to be available for
> dispatch by the ISO.
>
> Q - Is there any tolerance here given by the ISO?  For example, if a PMax
> is 30 MW and a Must Offer Generator can only do 29 MW due to ambient
> temperature conditions, must that Must Offer Generator submit an outage
> report for 1 MW?
> A - Yes, see next answer for detail.
> Q - Can such minor deviations be called in to the Generation outage desk
> rather than a report being filed?
> A - At this point there is no tolerance factor. An Outage Report must be
> created for any change of state (i.e., any factor impacting the maximum
> capability of the unit) whether from a de-rate (e.g., ambient temperature)
> or an equipment outage.  If the de-rate is known in advance (e.g., low
> water), it may be submitted to the Outage Coordination Office.  If the
> de-rate surfaces only in the real-time, it must be reported to the
> Generation Dispatcher who will create an Outage ticket.  At this time, it
> should handled as an outage, indicating that the unit is de-rated and for
> what cause and expected duration.
