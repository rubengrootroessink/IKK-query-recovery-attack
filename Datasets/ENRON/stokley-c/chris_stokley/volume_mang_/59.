Dear Melissa,

  Per our conversation on Friday 6-8-01, I want to come to a clear understanding of the expectations of Mike and I for completing outstanding PRIORITY DMS's and true-up.

  The following have been presented as priorities (in parenthesis are comments on their status):

   PGE - purchases and sales true-up for August - November 2000  (August and September are done, October is very messy with more than 3 discrepancies on any given day; we have only 3 days left oustanding in October, and only one day outstanding in November) (No DMS's for these)

  PAC - Friday we spoke about pressing issues with PAC (that have not been entered into DMS and that we in Portland didn't know about until Friday 6-8-01).  September 2000 DMS's have been completed and we are awaiting DMS's for the October and November outstanding stuff.  (There was one day in February 2001 that was outstanding that has now been completed for Feb 2001checkouts, so we should be current now for the year 2001)

  BPA - has completed their control area checkouts for purchases, sales, and transmission for June 2000 - December 2000.  (I have trued up the transmission side for August 2000 thru December 2000 and we are currently working on trueing up purchases and sales for June 2000 thru August 2000.)  There are many discrepancies each day given that these are the summer months and there are alot of cuts.  This will take a while to finish, but we are working on it every day.

  CRC - We spoke about on Friday; nothing has been entered into DMS, thus we did not know about any discrepancies until Friday 6-8-01.  We will await the DMS entries for discrepancies with Colorado River and work on them accordingly as a priority.

  El Paso - Kate Symes in the Real Time group is almost finished with May 2001 true-up and then we should be current.  She will be the point of contact person for El Paso going forward and she will work with Kathy at El Paso daily to make sure that our numbers, Kathy's numbers, and the El Paso Model match on a daily basis.

  These are the Priority issues as I understand them.  As you can see, Mike and I are spending almost 100% of our time just on last year's true-ups.   Please understand that given this information and per your agreement, Mike and I will be putting all current issues on hold until these things are complete.  Please also let Houston Settlements Coordinators know that we are not ignoring their current DMS's on purpose.  
Please let me know if any of the above mentioned are not a priority and I will move them to a medium status with a note to the Settlements Coordinator as to why they are off of the priority list.

Thanks,

Virginia
