Anna,

What would it take to change Settle15 for the "IsoIe" type of 405 to make it create and store the InterchangeID?  We are still getting duplications for them, and the days that Brett has as C's can be re-done if we mess it up.  It might be faster to change the tool (we need to run it again, anyway, since we're apparently missing the wheels, right?) rather than keep messing around in the database.

What do you think?
