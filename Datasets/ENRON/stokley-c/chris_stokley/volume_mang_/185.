Murray and Chris, 

The following is more detail on what had occurred below.
In running the metervalidation tool, I noticed on 5/28-a Monday there was a lower than average meter for load zone SDG1 (San Diego).  It was reported at 2,461, when a typical weekday is around 2,750.  I phoned Pat, and we discussed what was occurring and we noticed that Sat. was reported at 2,757 5/26, Sat.  Typically weekends days run at 2450 in SDG1.  

Pat's explanation doesn't fully explain why the weekend would slide one day.  And just in time, we discovered it.

If you need more information, please let me know.  I just re-ran the meter validation and the correct values are placed in 5/26 and 5/28.

Jim

I discovered this error, and had Pat send us an e-mail explaining the reason the Meter was wrong as well as updating the data.  They updated this within the 45 days.

Jim, the above settlement files were misstated due to an error in tracking
weekend vs weekdays. The original file showed the data for 5/26 to be a
normal load for a weekday while 5/28 reflected the load for a weekend.
The problem has been corrected and the files for 5/26 and 5/28 were
reposted.  The file for 5/26 was reposted on 7/17, day 45.
