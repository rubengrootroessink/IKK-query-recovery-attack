Mike,

Our group has a few questions about the inner-workings/process for the IT Website.  

When logging a problem, if we do not assign the incident to anyone--who receives the email and how do we know who is going to resolve it?  Is there a 'default' person whom we should assign issues when we don't know who should handle the problem?

Also, is there a closing procedure for the incidents?  If we add an incident and work w/ the IT person to resolve it, do we need to close the incident?  What is our responsibility?  

Thanks Mike, we just want to make sure that we are using your tool in the most efficient manner.

Kourtney
