Dear Mark and Tom,

We have received the bills for January and February transmission line losses.  I have disputed a few days each month and we have now paid the bill according to our figures for wheeled transmission: 


January 2001  Annuity Deal #  559263   for a total of    $115,579.91  (Tom's name)
February 2001 Annuity Deal #  559250  for a total of      $ 9,068.93  (Mark's name)

I have attached an excel document for each month to show our differences and how we have calculated the total annuity.  Cara and I have looked over them and we think this looks good.  (both annuities we are paying less that SRP is asking for, according to our MW Wheeling #'s)
  
Please contact me with any questions.

Thanks,

Virginia
