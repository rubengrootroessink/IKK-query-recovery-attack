Chris,

FYI:  Harbor's October wire will be going out tomorrow in the amount that Foster noted below.  Melissa and I confirmed these numbers.  And Caroline went over the November numbers with Foster as well.  So I think we are getting the process down!

Hope you're having fun!  :)

KN

Chris:

Confirming our discussion, there are 2 things that I want to make sure happen Monday and Tuesday this week:

1.  Harbor gets paid for Oct.  The amount is      $185,631.78 
2.  Caroline is going to get me final numbers for Nov. Harbor so I can put in the Services Desk Profit Annuity.
