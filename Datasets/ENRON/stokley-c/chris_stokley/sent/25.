Subject:	WIP for MV-90 data

Steve--

Here's a quick synopsis of what we need:

Users want actual historical metered data. If they can't get the data before it has been EEV'd (?) by MV-90, they need to know, for each value, whether it is the actual metered amount or an estimated value.
Users understand that there may be missing data, but do not require the meta-data detailing this. However, this is with the understanding that the back-fill data will eventually arrive at some later date.
We want any account- and meter-descriptive data as well as the associated volumetric data.
A  test file to see what kind of data are available and a few consecutive days worth of data to get a feel for volumes are needed.
If data is received from 12 - 6 a.m., how soon after 6 a.m. can we get a file?

Please do not "burn in" this process just yet because data and timing requirements may change.


Chris--

With the bullets above, Steve has promised to turn around the completed WIP by COB today or tomorrow morning. Hopefully this will at least get the ball rolling. It is then up to the business to determine whether to proceed and how to prioritze it. There must be concerted effort from the business to prioritize requests to CSC. Steve gave me Richard Miller's name as the EES coordinator for these requests. Please contact him and let me know what you find out.

Going forward we MUST establish who is responsible for filling these things out and keeping track of them. I've heard different things from different people, and I don't want to end up (nor should anyone else) being the person who fields random and anonymous lobs from the other side of the fence.

Cheers,

--John
