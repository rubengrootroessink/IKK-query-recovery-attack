Chris,
 
I have not been able to properly print these attachments.  Can you print a color copy & forward to Brenda at 3AC 1697?
 
Thanks,

Can you get me a color copy of this flow diagram?  I couldn't print it at home.  Thanks.

Here is the data model and data flow diagram for MDMA.  
<<MDMA_FLOW_DIAGRAM.ppt>> <<MV 90 data Model.ER1>> 
I am trying to find out if the data from MV90 get interfaced into MDMA on a daily basis
or not.  If it is done on a daily basis, then I don't think there is a need to go into MV90.
MV90 will have raw data and will not have gone through validations which are performed
in MDMA.

Vivian,
        I just wanted to leave you my contact numbers:
        
                                                Cell:    503-807-8959
                                                   Work:   503-464-8219

        I will be flying out tomorrow, but I should be in around 1:00 Pacific Time. Please send me an e-mail on where we stand with being able to get into the MV90 tables. I have Jeff Richter chomping at the bit on this one so it would be a nice if we can get our hands on that data. Thank you very much for your help on this topic.
