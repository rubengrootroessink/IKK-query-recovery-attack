Chris when you get a chance can look into this?

My back office has explained that we have received our  final payment for September business.  Thank you for the processing on that  part of the transaction.  We have, however, invoiced EPMI for interest  payments based on the understanding we had reached at my meeting in your offices  late last year.  The two interest invoices we have sent are for $16,359.28  and $4,530.74, for a total of $20,890.02.  To date, no payments have been  made by EPMI.  Could you look into the status of the processing on these  bills for us?
 
Thanks,
Steve
