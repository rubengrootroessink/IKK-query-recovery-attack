Attached is the TX market diagram and tentative answers (in red) to the settlement questions posed below.  

 << File: TXMarketDiagram.xls >>  << File: TXPreston730.doc >> 

Also, regarding the question posed earlier today,  Marty Sullivan 214-875-2636 (Enron's TXU representative) is checking to see if the information you requested is public and available.  TXU considers industrial customers to be >1 MW.  He informed me that on September 1st customer information will be released to marketers.  There is a possibility that by sorting through this information, you can identify the industrial customers in the TXU service territory.

Please call me with any questions.

While cautious of the issues we face, I'm very encouraged by your experience and your willingness to help. 

I tried to summarize the issues discussed in the meeting this afternoon in the attached report. Please let me know if I've erroneously attributed your name to an issue. 

Don't pay much attention to the Scenario at the bottom of the report. I haven't spent much time on it. 

 << File: ERCOT Physical Delivery Process.doc >> 

We will continue to fill in the blanks (and probably add issues) over the next few months. 

My short term goal is to identify the vast majority of the issues and have a plan of action related to those issues within the next week. 

Any feedback you have is welcome.
