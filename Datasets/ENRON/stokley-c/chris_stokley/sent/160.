I would agree, but I didn't think Kevin followed the Catholic faith so I moved him over to the Mormon faith. A lot of people I work w/ are Mormon and they remind me of old school Catholics, lots of kids.

Hey Stoke,

You were surprise about the baby! Just imagine how shocked we were - all
this time we figured it was a beer gut. If you are in Houston, we'll have to
get together on one of the weekends that you stay in town. The job search is
"...like jerking-off with a cheese grader, its slightly amusing , but mostly
painful." -Andrew Dice Clay

I disagree with the Mormon comment; as a matter of fact, I believe he is
doing great at upholding the catholic teachings regarding birth control.
Seriously, I believe this one is the last of his flock.

Bud,
	I had zero idea that Kevin had another baby on the way until he
sent out the pictures. He will need to convert to being a Mormon soon if
he keeps having kids. What is your latest on the job search? I am
currently on a 6-mth project in Houston, so forgive me if my responses
are not prompt.

		The room was full of pregnant women and their partners,
and the Lamaze class  was in full swing.

		The instructor was teaching the women how  to breathe
properly, along with informing the men how to give the  necessary
assurances at this stage of the plan.

		The  instructor then announced, "Ladies, exercise is
good for you.  Walking is especially beneficial. And, gentlemen, it
wouldn't hurt  you to take the time to go walking with your partner!"

		The  room really got quiet. Finally, a man in the middle
of the group  raised his hand. "Yes?" replied the instructor.

		"Is it all  right if she carries a golf bag while we
walk?"
