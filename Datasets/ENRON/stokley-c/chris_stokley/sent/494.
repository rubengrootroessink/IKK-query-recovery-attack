Mary Lynne - I spoke with Pam/Chris S./Mike F.about this issue.  Since Chris is  charged with improving the general settlement process including this specific inssue, he has asked me to be available to answer all his questions and defer all questions I receive to him.  He stated that he understood the urgency and attention this issue commands and will respond accordingly.

George - Do you know anything about this problem?  I would assume you would have seen large discrepancies b/w meter and scheduled.  Would appreciate a response asap as this has a great deal of attention!

Wanda and Jeff, 
Attached is the file we discussed putting together for your. 
Energy Schedules vs. Energy Usage (Meter Data) 
By looking at the information, it appears that the PGES book of business is the biggest problem. 
EES has constantly under scheduled the PGES book of business in the PGE3 load zone.  I'm nut sure if it is related to under scheduling or reporting incorrect meter data to the ISO. 
We discussed that starting on 2/1/01 the combined schedules for EES/PGES should have changed to 50mwh per hour (Both books of business included in this number). On averages.
Based on what I am seeing this is not the case. 
I have copied Michael Frazier on this message so he can take a look at the schedule information we received.  I have also included Jim Reyes in the Portland Volume Management group so he can look into the Meter vs. Schedule issues in April and May.  EES was scheduling volumes but never identified / reported usage (Meter data).  At the same time they were drastically under scheduling on PGE3
If anyone has questions please feel free to give me a call @ 503-702-9846

Thanks - MO
