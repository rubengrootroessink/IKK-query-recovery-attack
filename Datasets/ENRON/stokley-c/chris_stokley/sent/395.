Hey Chris,

I hope all is continuing to go as well as can be expected in H-town.

I'm writing with a worry and am not sure the best way to approach it.  The =
gist of it is that I am worried about the VM group and their reputation on =
the floor.  I'll give you a couple of examples as to why:  1) Chris Mallory=
 came to me and starting asking me questions about charges that go w/ impor=
ts and exports--I briefly answered but told him to talk to VM.  He said he =
didn't really know who to talk to, who would be able to answer his question=
s w/out Heather, you or myself back there.  (and he also did not know Jim R=
eyes' name until he asked me yesterday), 2) Bill came over the Darren today=
, concerned that he had been charged cong incorrectly b/c when Bill had che=
cked CAISO, the cong prices were all $0.  Not a huge deal that this happene=
d, but Jim needs to be signing off on the Flash ( i don't know if he is or =
not) and cong charges should always be closely monitored; and I don't think=
 that this is the first day that Bill has been incorrectly charged cong 3) =
Richter asked me who would be the person in VM that should help Tim Coffing=
 (his new analyst that moved up here) to deal w/ looking at the EES wholesa=
le settlements.  Jeff didn't know who would be the best b/c he doesn't real=
ly know the VM team anymore.  (I suggested Kit b/c he seems to be good at d=
igging into problems and getting answers).

Essentially, I think that the traders do not know all of the new faces, wha=
t they are doing and who they should be talking to.  You were always very c=
oncerned about the visibility/availability of the VM team as well as the cr=
edibility and I think these are suffering right now.  And of course on top =
of all of this is VMS.

Do you think I should send this to Scotty? Murray?  Without any management =
being here, I think it is tough to keep a heartbeat on the feeling of the t=
raders and I think that is part of the problem.  And I assume things will i=
mprove w/ Scotty here, but he needs to build relationships on the floor as =
well. =20

I am not trying to be critical of anyone or step on any toes, but I am conc=
erned. =20

Please let me know what you think...thanks and sorry to add a little more t=
o your plate of concerns... KN
