Subject:	Change Notification - Consumption

It is now apparent that the Change Notification Process, in particular Material Changes in Consumption, is more convoluted than what first appeared. To that end I am proposing the following:

1. A standing meeting to be held on Wednesdays at 2.00pm for the next 4 weeks to address the issues and formalize a Process Flow for each occurrence.
2. Draft Process Flow Documents to be prepared in the interim and passed out ASAP to all relevant parties for comment.
3. All comments/issued to be addressed through the Wednesday meeting.

An invitation for the meeting will be sent out shortly. Your attendance at yesterday's meeting was instructive and appreciated. Let's all try and get a good solid system in place by mid-October.

Also, a request for the attached questions to be sent out was proposed. Please review the questions and provide comments and/or add other issues you feel are not addressed. Please send your replies to all in the distribution list above. (I will be out of the country for 2 weeks and not have access to e-mail).

 

Thank you for your participation.

Martin
