Yes.  Of the 100 on that list, 30 are GNO and 70 are commodity.  I'm leaving early today and taking a few days of vacation.  I'll be back on Tue. night.  Have a good weekend.

Andy,
	That is 30 out of a total of 100 if I understood you correctly. Are the other 70 just the straight commodity deals? Thanks for your help on this item.

Chris--

The file attached below lists all the Project Phoenix deals.  I believe that all GNO deals (approximately 30 of them) are covered.

Let me know if you have any other questions.

Thanks,

Andy
