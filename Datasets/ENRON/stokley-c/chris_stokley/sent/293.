John,

	Could you tell me who I would speak to in order to find out the priorities that are pushing this process back to 11:00am? Also, how much time does it take you to get this file into the database once you receive the file from CSC? This is making the assumption that the database is configured and ready to go. What are you currently seeing in the way of missing data coming in from these files on a daily basis.

Have attached the project proposal as returned by CSC. I am also summarizing a discussion I had with Geoff Goodfellow of CSC:

Since CSC is using a third-party, packaged application to produce this file, they are limited in their ability to deliver exactly what we want (in the context of the 51 hour, $4,883.62 estimate).

We requested that missing data (e.g., phone line down) be backfilled in a later day's file, but this is not possible because the process to produce this file only queries on meter data for a specific date, not all data received on a specific date. For example, if they ran it today, for 7 August, we would receive all meter data for that date, but they would have actually received more than that on the 7th, perhaps data dated 6 Aug for meters that failed to dial in on that day. Getting this data will require further development (read: mo' money).

Also, the file is 26MB, of which more that 25% is blank spaces on the end of each line. Again, since this is an external application, I have been told that it is not possible to eliminate this extra space. (Not a killer, since we won't actually be putting it in the database, but it just adds to processing/network overhead.)

I have also been told that file delivery will occur between 11 a.m. and 12 p.m. daily. This is because of current priorities, but even at the earliest, we won't be able to get it before 7:30 a.m. (Data is collected from 12 a.m. to 6 a.m., the report run takes 1 hour 30 minutes, a file is produced at 7:30.)

--John
