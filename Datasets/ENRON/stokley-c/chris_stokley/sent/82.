This e-mail is being sent to users identified as current or past users of <\\eeshou-fs2\retail$> (known to most users as R:\ ) who are not members of the EES Risk Management Group.

In order to facilitate the integration of EES Risk Management into Enron Wholesale services it may be necessary to migrate the information contained in the R: Drive (<\\eeshou-fs2\retail$>) to another server.  We need your help to avoid unnecessary system overhead and also to make sure that no users are denied access to vital data.

If you would please verify and provide the following information:

1) That you are not a member of EES Risk Management.

2) Do you still Access <\\eeshou-fs2\retail$>  ( R:\ )?
	2a) For What purpose?
	2b) What folders in this drive do you access? (specific folder names please)
	2c) Can this information be saved elsewhere?

If you have any questions, please contact
