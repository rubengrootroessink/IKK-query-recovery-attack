Kristian,
	I will get the list of accomplishments out by end of business tommowrow. I apologize for taking so long to respond, it has been pretty hectic around here the last couple of weeks. I have been desperately trying to fill the positions within the group.  Hope all is going well with you and Monica. Did you find a place to live yet?


	ps     Did you hear that PG&E declared bankruptcy?

Great.  Paul asked if you could put together a summary of your accomplishments in an email.  Paul will shop you around to some different groups here.  He mentioned Rich Lewis (head of UK power) is looking for people who are good at analytics and have allot of perseverance.  Paul will be out of the office for the next week so don't feel pressured to do it right away.   I will try to give you a call.

Kristian,

	I met with Tim today to inform him of my intentions to pursue opportunities outside of the Portland office. It seem to go very well, w/ TIm also saying that he had expressed an interest in working in London. He did make sure and state that the London office is the highest cost office in all of Enron, and therefore would probably be the first on to experience layoffs if the economy took a downturn. His thought is that he wants to see if he can get me into something on the floor by mid year, but would support me if I decide to go elsewhere. The tougher issue is going to be telling Murray of my intentions. What do I do now to start truly pursuing a job in the London office?
