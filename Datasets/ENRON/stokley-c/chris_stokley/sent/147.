Chris,

A request was put in from Mike Tully to add exporting funtionality to the Scheduling Activity Report (SAR).  This functionality has been added and is now currently in Stage, ready for user testing.  I spoke with David Poston about who to contact for this, and he directed me to you.  If you have any questions please let me know, also please e-mail me back if the report is fine so I can put the request in to move it to production.

The Stage Version # is:  2.0.0.19
 
Thanks,

Brett Pate

Hey, good morning Will. I was out yesterday, so I could not get in touch with you. Sorry. Anyway, the problem is that the SAR report has no way to save the data to anything other than it's own special format. We need the ability to save this data into a CSV type file. The reason for this is that we sometimes send this report to customers and, presently, they cannot view the information. We also share this report with our traders who need immediate access to this report and cannot view it unless they take the time to Open up Enpower and then view the report through there. This presents a problem as most of the time Enpower is so slow. Is there any way that we can have an option to save the data to either a CSV Type, or as an Excel Document.

Thanks

Mike
