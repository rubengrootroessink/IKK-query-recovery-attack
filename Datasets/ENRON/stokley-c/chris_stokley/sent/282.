Good morning, Chris.

I apologize for not replying to you on Friday; I have been out of the office until today.

The problem with the Publications container is a Yahoo issue, as they are the backbone to the portal.  I have spoken with our Portal administrator, and he is working to fix the problem with Yahoo.  As soon as it is back up and running, you will be one of the first to know.

Thank you for your patience,
Elizabeth

When I go into the publication area to add magazines nothing happens. I added 
Megawatt Daily and Electric Power Daily and then hit the finished button, at this point 
nothing happens.
