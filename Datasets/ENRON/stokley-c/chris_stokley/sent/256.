Stewart,
	Let me make this very clear, no phone call will take place until you and I talk about this issue.

I am not interested in talking any more about this issue - you deal with it however you want and call whenever you want.  I am out of the process completely.  I will call you at noon tomorrow just to make sure it got resolved.

Stewart,
	How amazing that this is exactly what we agreed to this morning. You then apparently decided to put yourself back into the process and schedule a meeting that I did not agree to attend. I made it very clear that it would be difficult for me to attend a meeting today, but that I could try to break free for 2:30. I then thought that it would be on ME not yourself to schedule this meeting if I was able to break lose from my meeting by 2:30.I left my schedule open most of last week in order to resolve this issue. However, we never got a response from Steve to allow us to close this item. Before any phone call takes place to Steve tomorrow, you and I will talk about the handling of this item going forward. Please stop by at your earliest convenience so that we can put this issue to rest.


							Chris
