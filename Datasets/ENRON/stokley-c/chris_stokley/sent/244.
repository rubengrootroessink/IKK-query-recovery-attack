Pamela,

	Please forward to me Brett's last e-mail so that I can make sure that I keep the report in the same format that you are comfortable with using.

Chris will you be forwarding me the HA_Finals for EES and EEMC with Brett leaving the company?  Please let me know.  If so, will you forward me the lastest files you have for April.  Brett has already forwarded the 1st - 3rd.

Thanks,

Pam
