Jeff,
	Two questions:
		1) Whose name is the apartment in(Do I expense it)?
		2)  Isn't $107 a day higher than what we currently pay?

Jeff / Chris,

Well, I think the corp housing saga is finally completed!  

On 10/3/01, your belongings will be moved, free of charge, from Apt.# 4140 to Apt# 2307 in Mid Town Square.  The apartment is on the third floor, corner lot, w/ a slight view.  It is a 2 bed/2 bath and should be comparable to where you are now.  The rate should be $107 / day.  The apt is leased for three months until 12/31/01.  

Denise of Ex Lodging, will be calling you, Chris, to make arrangements for the key and garage door opener drop off.  I gave her your email address. I have the signed contract agreement which I will hand over to Jill when she returns from vacation. 

Jill:  I dealt w/ Denise at Ex Lodging. She can be reached at 713) 552-9852 x111.  They made a specific notation in the file that only you or Debra Davidson are authorized to make changes / cancel / modify the lodging agreement.  Come by my desk when you get back in town and I download the whole story.

Thanks, guys, and again, you've been great thru a frustrating experience!

Julie K
