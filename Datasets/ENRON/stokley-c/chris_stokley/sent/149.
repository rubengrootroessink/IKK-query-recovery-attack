A leopard never changes its spots! Is this an after thought since they heard you were going to leave? I would be worried about any position that I felt needed arm twisting to get to in the end. Sounds like a good opportunity, but I wonder why it is now coming to the surface and what is behind it. I am bias, I don't trust anyone on that side of the pond so I may not be the best person to give an objective answer. You have a good feel for people, go w/ your gut. You knew in you the back of your mind that this is the way that it would go down at the end of the day. Get some more opinions and then go w/ your instincts.

The opportunity here has been enhanced;   in addition to Managing RT,   I would be managing all of the Service Assets in Texas.   This includes trading around a 500 mw plant,   serving EES and New Power Company loads,  and also the potential for managing a new 1500 mw full requirements deal. 
Of course,  I would have to have all of this in writing.      I would be working with the Texas Term trader to enhance my trading skills in order to effectively manage this position.
This makes the offer more attractive,  but still I would be in Houston.      I am still apprehensive of the bait & switch exposure.
What do you think?
