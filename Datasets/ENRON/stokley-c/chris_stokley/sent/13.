Mary Lynne,
	I just got a chance to look at this document. Take a look at line 19(Utilities Covered), I think it has all of the information you are looking for.

Chris - Is there any master list of Utility acronyms with the full name of the utility ?

Take a look at this document. The section with major players is the one with the utilities that are tied to an index, however, there are some minor utilities that are not covered in that list. Do you think that we need the minor utilities?

Were you able to get the utility names for PJM?
