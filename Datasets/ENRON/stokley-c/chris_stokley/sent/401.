Kit,
	Sorry about not being able to get back with you on the PX issue yesterday. I will be wrapped up today until this afternoon. Give the Dan or Clark a call and have them walk you through this invoice, the number are listed at the bottom of the second e-mail. Find out where the PX short pay is encompassed in the account summary(about 9 million dollars). Once you walk through this with them, give me a call on my cell and lets discuss before we comment back to the lawyers. Sorry about having to pass the buck, but they have Murray and I scrambling. Call me on my cell if you need any further guidance.

							Chris

The attachment in the e-mail below contains the EPMI balance with the PX(EPMI 081001.xls). The Win zip files sent by the ISO contain the backup to the 1480 Overview file.

Subject:	EPMI - Account Summary as of August 10, 2001

PARTICIPANTS:
Enclosed is your updated Account Activity Statement summarizing all accounts receivable/payables activities with CalPX occurring during 2001 starting with the issuance of the December Day-Ahead/Day-Of Market invoice back in January through the April Real Time invoices in August.
The April billing cycles are adjustments being made by CAISO that go back as far as Spring 2000.  CAISO is continuing to make these adjustments, which are basically meter corrections and approved scheduling coordinator disputes, for prior periods.  These will probably continue for a few more months because of the recent FERC ruling regarding refunds.
Please feel free to call Don Deach (626-685-9876), Rachel Axelrad (626-685-9843) or Clark Cheng (626-685-9846) with any questions.
Thank You.
(See attached file: EPMI 081001.xls)
