Paige,
	It has been requested that I fly back to Portland sometime today, so I will not get a chance to meet with you this week. I have attached a document with a  list of the variables that I thought needed to be captured to settle a consumption band contract. Please take a look at this and give me your input. Thank you very much for your help on this item.
