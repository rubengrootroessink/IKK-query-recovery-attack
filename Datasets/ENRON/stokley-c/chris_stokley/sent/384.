FYI?

I left Mark a message today indicating that I was not comfortable that they were capturing all of the different parameters associated with Baseline and Bandwidth on our current contracts correctly.  My biggest concern here is that we need to make sure that CSC who is doing our billing is reflecting the same information.  There needs to be an action items which I thought was started two weeks ago to ensure that everything which is needed by CSC on the Deal Ticket is captured by us on our deal tickets so we can on populate a deal ticket once.  The ultimate would be that we have more on our deal ticket then CSC needs and they can pull just their relative elements.

Brenda,
	Operations have for some time communicated the consumption excess and deficiency charges to CSC on the deal request form in the comments section. They have also indicated the method of calculation. We strongly suspect that these are not being charged correctly and as a result Barry VanDerHoarst and I am currently running an investigation of 10 randomly selected deals to check the CSC pricing calculations. Please let me know who in your group should be involved with this initiative. We have been capturing this information on our deal tracker now for the past two weeks for both power and gas.

Regards,
Mark

Subject:	RE: consumption band confirm

AK,

Thanks for the voicemail yesterday.  This is what I need confirmation on:

Power - Are the consumption bands being captured on the del sheets?  Are they being communicated to CSC for invoicing purposes?  If they are being captured and communicated, what day did this start?  It had to be within the last week.  If they are not being captured and communicated to CSC, it needs to start ASAP and I would like confirmation of the official start day.

Gas - It is my understanding that they are being captured on the deal sheets and in the Risk books.  I have confirmed that CSC is billing over/ undertakes.  I just want to make sure that the deal sheets, when consolidated with the customer/new deal set-up with CSC, continues to capture that information.

Thanks for your help.

This is what I know.

The DASH definitely captures the consumption band.  As I understand it, a consumption risk book is not up and running.  I believe Mallik's intention is to have in running by the end of the year.

If you need anything else come see me.

Mariano:
In your review of the following contracts, is the DASH capturing the consumption band and is this structured into the risk books?


Pac Bell
Home Depot	
Sysco
EOP
Pepsi
 "Medge Industries"

Please advise.
Thanks.
