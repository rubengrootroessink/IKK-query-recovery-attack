fyi

Here are some questions and answers that you will find helpful:
*	Are self provided ancillary services (on a SC required basis)
sequential; excess spin rolls into nonspin requirement for the SC (if
offered
as nonspin).

 NO, If an SC self provides 130 MW of SPIN capacity yet the calculated
market requirement is only 100MW,  the self-provided amount of 120 MW will
be accepted for SPIN and none of the EXCESS 30 MW of capacity considered for
other A/S services.

Please Note if in this example the SC's SPIN obligation is calculated to be
90 MW, the over self provided portion (100MW - 90MW) = 10 MW would receive a
payment.  In this example there is an additional 20 MW of EXCESS above the
total market requirement that "gets left on the table" which will receive no
compensation.


*	If self provision reserves are offered in excess of the total
quantity required for the total market, will the ISO take them all anyway or
will the offerings be truncated and perhaps roll into a subsequent service
(if offered as self provide in that service).

NO, As in the above answer.  The total Self provided quantity will be
accepted and there would be no reduction of the preferred schedule even if
this amount is ABOVE the total market requirement.
