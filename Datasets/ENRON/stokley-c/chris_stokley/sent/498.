Chris:
This is further to our conversation in the afternoon.
I am doing a project to value real time power consumption information. Currently the forecast is done based on old data and there is a variance between the forecast, the load block purchased and the actual power consumption. The variance between actual and the forecast  entails penalties. I would like to know more about the structure of penalty and the amount being paid in Californai by EES where it serves physical power. Some of the questions that I have is:
How is penalty determined.
Are their other expenses apart from penalty that is levied on EES for the variance.
Any other information in this context that can help in the valuation.
What are other things involved in the settlement process that can help in determining the value of real-time information.
I would like to meet with you to discuss this further.
Regards,
Rajat Khater
