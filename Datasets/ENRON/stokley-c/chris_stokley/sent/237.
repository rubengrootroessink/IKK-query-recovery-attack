Chris and Murray,

Jane requested that I follow up with you regarding EPMI's need for ISO audit
agreed-upon procedures.  (I visited the Cal ISO website, and did not readily see
discussion of 2000 audit requirements.)

Please let us know as soon as possible if you will need our assistance, as we
are in the midst of our 2001 planning.

FYI - Jane is no longer with Arthur Andersen.  Debra Cash is our engagement
partner, and I am an engagement senior.

Thanks,
Linda
