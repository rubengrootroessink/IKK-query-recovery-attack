Great.  Let me know the room, and I'll send out a meeting update.  Or you can email everyone; whatever works best.

Neal

Where:	

Dave Poston will be doing the demo here in Houston.

The main demo should take maybe an hour and a half depending on how many questions we ask.  After that, Dave would like to go over things in more detail if anyone wants to learn more.  He says he can spend 4 hours or more discussing it if we want.

I'll send out location information when I get it.
