Chris,

I believe Neal Symms is working with Sung-Hang's boss for transition him over to EES.

This is the gentleman we discussed several weeks ago from EBS who understands the "old" EES system set-up very well.  He worked with John Henderson (New Power), Anoush Farhangi (New Power), Vivian Hart (EES- IT), and others in the establishment of several databases (e.g., Pub DB) and systems applications when EES was first getting started.  He might be a great candidate to help transition EES systems into the established EWS systems you prefer as an end solution.
Michael

FYI:  The word is that HR has a moratorium of some sort on placing former EBS staff with IT.  That's why this guy is now available -- he wants some options.
