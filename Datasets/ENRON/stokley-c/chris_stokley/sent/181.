Hey bud,
	I am now officially out of VM and working on the EES mess. I will give you details later, but in a nut shell I will be spending a lot of time in Houston over the next 6-mths. Looks like I will be working with Richter on try to sort out the issues that we currently are having w/ EES.  Did you get a house yet? Also, set up the MSN IM so we can talk.

				Chris

Hey, 
When you get a chance, will you email me with the reading list?  
What's the latest with your situation - VM vs Cali vs London? 
Hope all is going well with you and yours.  Keeping too busy down here.  Tell the group I said Hey.
