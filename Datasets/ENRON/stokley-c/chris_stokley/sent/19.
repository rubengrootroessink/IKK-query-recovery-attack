Hi Chris.
 
Brett said that he has had trouble sending you e-mail to this address since we have arrived in Austin.  I just wanted to see if you could return this same message to me if this address is correct.  Don't worry about writing a reply.  
 
He sent you another message last week and I just wanted to make sure you received.  I know Brett isn't looking for a reply anytime soon considering how busy you and he both are.  
 
Take care and tell Rachel I said hello.
 
Holly
