Hi Chris,

Here are the deals I spoke to you about over the  phone.  These are hourly deals however, based on the information that is on APX's website I can't seem to match these deals with anything.

The deal numbers are: 595705, 595714, 595819.  They were traded at the end of April.

Thanks very much for your help.

Evelyn
