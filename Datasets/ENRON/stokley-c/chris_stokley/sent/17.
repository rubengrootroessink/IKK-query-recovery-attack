Chris,

I submitted a WIP last week for 3 other pieces of information for each of our 5 audit days.
% of estimated accounts
% of estimated intervals
Detailed account file, SQMD file and MDEF file

CSC is preparing a quote to provide this information, which will be forwarded to me Friday. 

Please advise what needs to be done to obtain approval for this quote.

Thanks,

Ken
