Chad,
	Sorry I haven't called you back, I flew into Houston yesterday and rt back out that afternoon. Your message last week didn't show up on my phone until Friday morning. My phone seems to get somewhat buggy when I am in Houston. I will be back in Houston next week, but I will give you a call tonight or tomorrow.
