What is weird is that Jeff S. is still in the building, so it must have truly been his decision. They are issuing more stk, but I have not yet heard the details on how that will work. As far as Greg, I have heard very little on what lead up to his final departure. I know that his son had just had an operation and I think there may have been some complications. Then throw in a new born and watch the stress level rise.

Thanks for the update - off the record, does Gregory know what he is doing? I'll have to give him a call. 
On another subject, has Ken Lay taken odds that if he "opens" the books now, he can go back to cooking them later?  Also, heard that the big e had to issue more stock to retain employees - are you so lucky or does your contract tie you up?
