Steve,
	I don't see the attachment. As far as the percentage of Calf. contracts that have  band consumption, my assumption is that it is quite high. I base this on our discussion w/ Dennis and my talks w/ Neil Bresnen. My understanding is that all contracts that where written after first quarter of 1999, have some type of  band consumption language in them.  I spoke w/ Joshua yesterday and I feel that we are making the progress that I would expect at this point. I would like to meet w/ you when I get back in Houston on Monday if you have the time. Also, Joshua is supposed to send me an update today so that I can better assess as to where we are at on the consumption band initiative.

			PS. Sorry I am late getting back w/ you, I could get into my e-mail yesterday but could not send out any e-mail. I still owe you the Project Phoenix   			       list. Also, do we still need to meet w/ Kristian and Murray?


									Chris

Attached is a spreadsheet created by KPMG with some results from CSC data and RPS testing done on California.  This is just for your information.  Do you have any idea what percentage of contracts will have a band consumption.  I am trying to understand your personnel needs to accomplish your objectives.  You can give me a call to discuss or just respond via email.  Thanks.
