Kate,
	Returned your call, but your phone would not put me through to voice mail. Any help you can give Pam would be quite beneficial and appreciated by both her and I. She is getting zero help down here and that is why I pointed her you your direction. I have not dug down in the process, but is seems to be way to  manual for all parties involved. I just want the process improved so that it takes some of the manual error work out the flow. Give me a call at 713-345-6120 if you need anything.

								Thanks
								 Chris

Pam -

I am your Hour-Ahead, or Real Time, contact. I've attached all of my contact information below. You can also find this information attached to the EES Hourly sheet I send you each day.

Kysa is your Day-Ahead contact. Her phone number is 503-464-7486.

If you can tell me more specifically a) what kind of problems you're running into with the CARP report and our sheets, and b) whether the problems are related to the EES Daily sheet (which outlines day-ahead deals) or the EES Hourly sheet (which outlines real time deals), then I can be of more assistance. As I said in my last e-mail, I've gone over all the variances you've sent, and none appear to be related to hourly deals. I've also attached the reconciliation model I maintain each day so you can see how I've tied out Enpower to the hourly model for every day in September.

Please let me know if I can do anything else to help.

Thanks,
Kate Symes

Kysa/Kate, we are still having problems with the real time sheets and the CARP/Enpower report not tieing.  Given this, Chris would like to know what group in your office is preparing your Reat-time/Daily excel spreadsheets and is there a contact person for this group?

Thanks,

Pam
