Bob,

Brenda wants us to move quickly with this request.  In your opinion, what is the best way to process this request?  If you put it under the 'Ranger' request, will this escalate this to the top?  If so, please do it.  It you have another process, let us now.  We do not want to incur additional charges by using an ECR, if we can avoid it.

What 'paperwork' needs to be completed?   WIP?  other?

Thanks

In an effort to centralize information uncovered in various meetings, I have put together a short document covering *my* understanding of the meter data flow. Please take a look at ...

     http://172.24.5.129:90/sp/doc/project/analysis/meterdataanalysis.html

...and reply with any corrections, additions and feedback--I will incorporate them into the document.


Pat Priest has told us that if we could get a WIP in by today regarding the daily download of meter data from MV-90, CSC might be able to turn something around to us by next week. Who is in charge of this process? Who gives the go-ahead?

--John
