Kristian,
	
	I finally grew some balls and had my meeting with Murray. It went really well, a lot different than I expected. I now have to meet w/ Tim so that he can lay out what opportunities he thinks exist on the floor. That should be interesting. I will get in early tomorrow, and give you a call to give you an update. I have not sent my accomplishments b/c I wanted to hear what Tim had to say as far as opportunities on the floor. The last thing I want to do is have Paul take the time to go pass around my resume and me not follow through on those potential offers. Talk to you tommorow.

								Chris
