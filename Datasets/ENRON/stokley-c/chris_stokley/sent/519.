Mary,
	I apologize for being such a pain in the ass, but  I will not be in the office today due to sickness. I think I have some form of streep(?) throat( rash around my neck and very painful to swallow). Reschedule the 11:00 Genesis meeting for any open time after 1:00 tomorrow, the rest of the meeting I will try to call in on. Feel free to call me, I will be online working if you need anything from me. I feel well enough to work, just worried that I might be contagious.


						Chris
