Chris,

I left a message on you answering machine last Thursday at 4:36 p.m. (PST)
regarding higher loads noticed in PGE territory. I'm sending this email n
case you're out for a period of time.

I basically just noticed that load had risen above observed normal levels in
July for EPMISCE1, EPMIPGE1, EPMIPGE2, and EPMIPGE3. I was wondering if you
knew why this was happening? On my phone message I also indicted that I had
seen schedules going up as well and assumed that you may be picking up new
customers.

Thank you,

David Alvarez
