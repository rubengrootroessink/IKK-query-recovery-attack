Caroline, 
	
	While I agree with you that having you go to Houston would be productive, it is a luxury that we cannot afford. We are currently four and a half months behind on our actualization process, with both the internal and external customers running out of patience. With also have Brett leaving this Friday and Donna out until next week, I need you to focus solely on getting us actualized for the months in question. We also have a deliverable to Seattle City Light by the end of this week. Until we get these items settled, I can not allow the transition of duties between yourself and Virginia to take place as we had planned. We all want this transition to happen, but we have to get these deliverables out the door.  I hope that you can understand that with all of these issues on the VM plate, my answer will have to be no to your going to Houston. 



							Chris

Chris,

I understand that Virginia has been approached to head down to Houston and meet with the Settlements group.  I would like to be part of that as well, if that is alright.  There are still some things they do on their side that I would like to learn about, and I think that Virginia and I could collaborate on a sharing of information meeting and both would get a lot out of it.

Let me know.  I guess the date hasn't been settled, yet, but I am available pretty much any time in the next few weeks.
