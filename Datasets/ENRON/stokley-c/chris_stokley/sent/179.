Pat,
	The files are checked by EPMI on a daily basis, however, nothing is done w/ these files until an explanation is sent as to why they are being resubmitted. In our process we need to be able to explain both the reason for the resubmital and the MW variance to the ISO.

Subject:	Settlement Update

All, since our last meeting, here's where we are
now........................

In summary, our late submissions for early March dates were due to missing
load profiles in our manually run estimation database.  Once the problem
was detected and corrected on 4/18, day 41 for 3/8 settlement, the process
began to generate and regenerate the files from 3/1 forward.

A second problem was detected on 5/1 that caused high loads for SCE in
settlement files 3/17-3/24.  The MDMA system, which generates the actual
usage settlement file was incorrectly updated from our STAT system causing
the MDMA system  to calculate incorrect settlement numbers for an incorrect
set of customers, primarily those customers in SCE which had rolled back to
bundled service.  These files were posted to sparky and are now being
corrected for resubmission to sparky.  The load differences will be sent to
you as the corrections are made.

Observations and changes to procedure:
We were unaware that sparky was not manually checked on a daily basis for
late postings.  We became aware of this on 5/7 when Chris called to find
our why all of the late files were sitting on sparky.  Going forward,
Chris, I will let you (all) know of any late submissions.  Do you (Chris)
need notification on all postings or just the ones that are after day 45?

We are  securing a full time settlement person who will be in a position to
detect problems at the time the file is generated and move more quickly
toward resolving problems.

Steve Walker is working with Mike Frazier on the request for account,
usage, etc. listing.

Update on MDMA system generated estimates:
Still testing - fine tuning the missing accounts selection; calculations
look good.  With all of the above interruptions, this has taken a bit of a
backseat during the past couple of weeks.

Give me a call, if you need more details or have questions.
