Paige,
	Here is an update of the document that I sent this morning.

		ps. I may be staying in town until at least tomorrow morning, if so, I would still like to meet with you at your convenience.

Guys -

Please review my amended requirements for the Baseline/Bandwidth project.  I
think the approach will be relatively simple, with a lot of data entry on
the side of our staff.  That notwithstanding, I think that our requirements
are pretty solid, with the exception of the code/calculations required for
actually establishing baselines/bands where they do not exist.  We will need
to establish processes and procedures for doing so; this for the staff
actually performing the contract-by-contract work.  We should discuss this
stuff again today.  thanks.
