Steve,
	Take a look at the e-mail and give me you insight. We talked about this a few months ago and never came to a solid conclusion. I just want to try and put it to bed. Thanks for your help on this matter and I hope all is going well for you.

							Chris

Hi Chris,	
	
	I wanted to check on California Energy Resouces Scheduling - the piece they disputed paying us in February.  Virginia had in DMS that you are handling this now. So, to refresh your memory, they did not pay us $186,000 in February - broken down as follows:

Deal #533136.1  2/1/01  800 mws on peak @ $46.50/mw = $37,200
Deal #533136.1  2/2/01  800 mws on peak @ $46.50/mw = $37,200
Deal #533136.1  2/3/01  800 mws on peak @ $46.50/mw = $37,200
Deal #533136.1  2/5/01  800 mws on peak @ $46.50/mw = $37,200
Deal #533136.1  2/6/01  800 mws on peak @ $46.50/mw = $37,200

They said CDWR did not pick a block forward from the PX until 2/7/01.  So they are saying these weren't theirs until the 7th.

Thus my accounts receiveable shows that we have been shorted $186,000.  I need to know if I can collect this from them or if we will change the deals so that they will not be charged for the above days they are disputing.  I really need to get this fixed as soon as possible - since this shows possible exposure to us if we can't collect or DPR to the West if we have to remove these deals for the above days.

Let me know if you have any questions and let me know what info. you have.

Thanks!
Amy
