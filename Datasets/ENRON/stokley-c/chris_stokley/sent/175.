Subject:	January 2001 Price Cap Adjustments

In accordance with FERC

?s April 6, 2001 Order Dismissing Rehearing, Accepting
Compliance Filing and Directing the Recalculation of Lower Wholesale Rates,
CalPX has implemented the $150 breakpoint detailed in FERC?s December 15, 2000
order.  CalPX has included an adjustment amount on the January 2001 Day-Ahead
and Day-of invoices reflecting the breakpoint implementation.  In summary, CalPX
calculated the Day-of and Day-Ahead market settlements and Block Forward
settlements as usual, and included an adjustment amount that took into account
congestion, bid prices, overscheduling, and block forward contracts.  These
adjustments are detailed in new forward market products created specifically for
the adjustments (see new product list below).  The attached file provides a
further explanation of the method used. Also attached are the CalPX filing
requesting guidance and FERC's response. The January Forward market invoice,
price cap adjustments, and CTS invoices are scheduled to be released May 8,
2001.


Product Codes Codes for FERC Adjustments:
