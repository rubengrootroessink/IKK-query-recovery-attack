I would like to see this project get move forward immediately. Is there a reason that AA will not start working on this until July?

Chris,

We plan on performing our work in July in order to be able to issue the report
in August. Please let me know if you disagree with this timeframe.

Thanks,
Linda

Linda,
     I am ok with the  most of the Audit plan except for the date of
completion. August 2001 seems quite excessive since we now have one SQMD
audit under our belts. Please provide to me the logic behind the thought
that this Audit will take over 3mths to complete.

                                         Thanks
                                          Chris

     Chris,

     I just wanted to follow up with you to ensure that you received the
     ISO Audit
     Plan draft yesterday.  If you did not receive it, please let me know
     so that I
     can re-send it.  We would like to receive your feedback before we
     finalize the
     document.

     Thanks,
     Linda
