Todd,
	I apologize for not getting back w/ you in a more timely manner. As far as tracking a deal through the system, we have made very little progress. I have been pulled off on a couple of other projects that were deemed to be of higher priority. I talked to Chris Leonard last week to see if he could be of some help in tracking this down for us since he knows the Risk systems very well. He agreed, and I will follow up w/ him to day on what his approach will be.
