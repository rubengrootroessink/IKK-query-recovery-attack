Sorry, but I have a previous engagement that slipped my mind.  We will
have to move this back a week.  Let's plan on October 25th.  Will this
work for everybody?

Chris, sorry to interrupt your meeting.  

Let's all get together for supper at my house on Thursday October 18th
around 7:00pm.  If you can come earlier feel free to do so.

Kerry, bring the family.
Chris, I don't know if your family is down here or not, but if so then
they are invited as well.  Just give me a call and let me know if you
can make it.  My work number is in my signature.  My home number is
281-516-0743.  Best way to get directions is by using www.mapquest.com.
my address is 19526 Rocky Bank Drive, Tomball Tx, 77375-7751.  Mapquest
will give you perfect directions.

Regards,
KMJ

Well just wanted to drop you a line and say Happy Birthday.

Hope your hands heal soon.  I assume you haven't responded to my emails
because you probably broke both hands and can't type right now.
