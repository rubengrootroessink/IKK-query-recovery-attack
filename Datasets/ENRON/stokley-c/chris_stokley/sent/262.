I would like to discuss the EPMI/SCL split on the differences  detailed in Caroline's spreadsheet.  It appeared that the differences were  the gross amounts owed by the CISO for our business, without being segregated  into a recomputed EPMI portion and SCL portion.  I would like to clarify  the magnitude and certainty of the difference between our Prelim and expected  Final payments at this point in time.  Given the magnitude, I think we  should then discuss the timing of payments, so it might be a good idea if Stuart  were on the call as well.  My calendar is open from 1 to 2 if you want to  work it in then.

Steve,

     I will  be in meeting most of the morning but have an open schedule
after 12:30  today. Would 1:00 be a good time for us to discuss any pending
items that we  have left to complete? Could you please send me a list of the
hot items so  that I can research them before our  meeting.


                                    Thanks for your  patience
                                              Chris
