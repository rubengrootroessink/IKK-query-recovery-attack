Hi Chris. Since you will be going to baton rouge one weekend and then to New orleans the next, I changed your return flight on the ticket originating from Portland on 23jul to return IAH/PDX on 10aug the 940am flight. The other ticket we did originating in Portland on 30jul will be printed and used towards your next trip from Portland. This was the least expensive way to handle your traveling to Baton Rouge and New Orleans. If this is confusing, you may call me at 713-860-1155 for me to explain it better. I assume the last itineraries for Baton Rouge and New Orleans are okay to ticket. 
thanks
cynthia
