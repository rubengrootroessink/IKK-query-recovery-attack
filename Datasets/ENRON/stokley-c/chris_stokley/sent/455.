Attached are copies of the most recent drafts for the various change
notification processes.  I have a hard copy available as well if you are in
town and you let me know where I can find you.  These maps will be covered
in our meeting on Wednesday.  Please let me know if you have any questions.
I can be reached at ext. 56446.
