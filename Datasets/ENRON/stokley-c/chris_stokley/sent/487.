Chris,
I left you a phone message yesterday requesting some of your time to
discuss Wholesale Settlements within the Risk Management.  Since my
voicemail isn't setup, I thought I would also send an email.  Murray O'Neil
suggested we meet with you.  Please let me know when you are available.
Thanks,
Kristin

Do you have availability on Monday afternoon or Tuesday to meet with the
Project Genesys Business Architecture team?  Please let me know what days

Thanks,

Good Morning Chris,

I'm working with Craig Everson and Mark Feist on the Business Architecture
Phase of the Genesys Project. Mark identified you as EWS's manager
responsible for Wholesale Settlements within the Risk Management Group. I
would like to meet with you Thursday to ask a series of questions about
this functional area. Please let me know when you can meet and I will
schedule a conference room.

Thanks,

Scott

P.S. If there are additional people that would add value to this
discussion, please let me know.
