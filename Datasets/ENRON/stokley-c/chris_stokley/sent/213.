Melissa,
	The payments that we need to send out to these counter parties are listed below. These payments are being made based off of our estimates for both the month of Nov. and Dec. The Nov. payment is being calculated at 23 cents on a dollar (Due to the ISO short-pay) while the Dec. payment is dollar for dollar.  We will then actualize both Nov. and Dec before the close of the May accounting month. Please give me call if you have any questions on this topic.
