Diane,

	Jeff Richter has put me on task to resolve the issue that we currently have in trying to get meter data from CSC in a timely matter. Michael Frazier mentioned that you had sent a proposal to Jeff, and that you were waiting on him to review it and give you a sign off to go forward on your proposal. However, when I spoke w/ Jeff last night he had not yet received your proposal. Could you please forward your proposal to myself and Murray O'Neil so we can get up to speed as to what our option are in resolving this issue.
