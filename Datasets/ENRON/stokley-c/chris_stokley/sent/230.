I was informed that Brett is no longer handling the HA_Finals reporting.  Would you please let me know who will be handling this reporting hence forth.

Thanks,

Pam

Brett, for March 17th, hour 1 SCE1 has no volume.  Also, for March 11th I still need to get a revision for hour 1 on PGE3 and SDG1.

Would you please give me updates as soon as possible.

Thanks,

Pam
