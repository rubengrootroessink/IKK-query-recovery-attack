>>>Well, I asked how much, and she responded, "Only two fifty, it's a great

>>>and I remembered I had only spent $9.95 for two salads and about $20.00
>>>for a

>>>Attorney
>>>General Office for engaging in fraud. I was basically told, Do what you

>>>Don't bother thinking of how you can get even, or even try and get any of
