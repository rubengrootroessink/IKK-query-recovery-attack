This email is to summarize how i think we are going to book the LA AS transactions so as to ensure smooth settlements and month end.  Whoever intiates the deal will put in two enpower transactions:

Transaction One:  This one represents ENA buying AS from LA at the agreed upon capacity price and volume

Transaction Two:  This one represents ENA selling AS to EES at an agreed upon price and volume (Once Bill finishes his assessment of work he will work with Neil to determine what fee is appropriate  - this fee will be embedded in the price he sells to EES).

Lastly any time the AS gets exercised Bill's group will put the energy in caps and enpower.

If you have any questions or comments on the process let me know.

Stewart
