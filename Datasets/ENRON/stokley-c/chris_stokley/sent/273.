Subject:	FW: Question about Instructed/Uninstructed Energy Data Usage


I had to leave early yesterday, but I was able to get in touch with John to
follow-up with your page.  See response below and feel free to provide a
specific example for us to research.  Thanks

> two columns.
> For LocationType G, there is a volumetric difference of 153.15 (more in
> the Deviation column than in the Energy column)
> In comparing IE to the Settlement Statement data -
> When I use the volumes in the Uninstructed Energy column for all
> LocationTypes, I have a volumetric difference of 10.52 (less in the IE
> data).
> However, when I use the Uninst Energy column for L and C, and the
> Deviation column for G, I then have a volumetric difference of 142.63
> (less in the Settlement Statement Detail data).
> My question is two- or several-fold:
> What causes the volumes in the two columns to be different for the G type?
> I could find no discernable value to make it change anywhere in the data.
> Which column has the values that the ISO uses in determining the total net
> position for EPMI?
> Why don't the two sets of volumes match (IE to Settlement)?
> I really need to understand this, as we are required to tie all of our
> customer's volumes back to the Settlement Statement file, and, again, when
> the backup file doesn't match or is inconsistent, that makes our goals
