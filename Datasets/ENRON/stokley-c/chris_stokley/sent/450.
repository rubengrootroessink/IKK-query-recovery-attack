I wanted to get w/ Steve Fisher to discuss the gathering of the different types of contracts that we spoke about in yesterdays meeting. As for the 1:00, I wanted to go over the fields needed to calculate the consumption bands. How much time do you have at 1:00, maybe we can consolidate these meeting and go over all of the fields with Steve and Glenn in the room.

what is the subject of the four o'clock - are we only talking about the consumption bands or all the fields in general.  I was wondering if it would be good for Glenn to hear their process.
