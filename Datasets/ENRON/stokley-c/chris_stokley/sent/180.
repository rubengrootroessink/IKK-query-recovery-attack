For those that  haven't got a clue yet, Mother's day is Sunday!
Call your Mother! ;-)  */
A man called his mother in Florida. "Mom, how are you?"
"Not  too good," said the mother. "I've been very weak."
The son said, "why are  you so weak?"
She said, "because I haven't eaten in 38 days."
The  man said, "that's terrible.  Why haven't you eaten in 38 days?"
The  mother answers, "Because I didn't want my mouth to be filled with food
if you  should call."
