Keoni,

	Are you sure? It seems that we would have a charge or expense or both.

Keoni,

	Take a look at the file you sent last time and you will notice
that it does not contain 4/13/01. As far as the 4/29/01 file, you have
finalized this and should be able to send it to me.


								Chris

 << File: Book1.xls >> <<Book1.xls>> Sorry about that.  There was a lot
of cutting and pasting
involved.
