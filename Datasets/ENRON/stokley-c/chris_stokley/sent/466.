Hi Chris.  
 
I know you must just be swamped.  Brett and I have been wondering how work is going for you and how Rachel, Raven and Savannah are.  Please forward me your home e-mail address and your physical address so that I can keep in touch with you guys through Rachel.  Tell everyone hello.
 
Holly
