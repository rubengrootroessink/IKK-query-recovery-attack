Chris:

Per our conversation last week, I have changed the trading terminal server on which the timeout settings have been lifted.  At present, the timeout settings are lifted on NAHOU-TRDTS1.  We will cycle NAHOU-TRDTS5 into the maintenance schedule this weekend.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Andrew
