Update time. What is the latest on the job hunt? Since talking w/ you I have seen so many articles coming out on how difficult it is for the recent grads to find employment. I was hoping that I could be of more help to you, but Enron is long people right now. I do feel like I can be of some help by year-end, but I realize that doesn't help you rt now. I am spending pretty much every week in Houston until year end trying to get one of our internal units sorted out.  Maybe we can try to hook up one weekend in Houston, if not, I will see before the year is out.

				PS. Rachel is coming in to town this month and she wants to make sure she gets a chance to see you. I will find out exact dates and send them to you.
