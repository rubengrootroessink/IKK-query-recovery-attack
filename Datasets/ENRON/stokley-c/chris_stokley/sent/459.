In STAT, they mean the following:

     Active - delivering commodity, billing has begun
     Submitted - the account has been DASR'ed, commodity is flowing, no
bill has been sent from the UDC
     Cancelled - the account never became active
     Closed - the account is no longer flowing commodity, last invoice has
been sent
     Deactive - the account has been sent to the utility to close, last
invoice has not been sent
     Pending - account is waiting for installation of a meter to being
flowing commodity

(Pam did I get all these correct?)
