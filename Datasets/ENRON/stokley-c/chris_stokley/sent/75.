Hey, I was just thinking about you and Kristian yesterday. I never see you on the IM anymore, do you still have access to it? Spending most every week in Houston is getting old, but I think we may finally be making some progress. Family is doing great when I see them  and I will evaluate my situation at year-end. How is your job going and is Kristian going to remain in the fold. I think things have finally gotten much better in Risk, so that is a very good thing. You and Kritian pop on IM sometime so we can chat. 

						Chris

We haven't heard a peep from you in ages.  How's life treating you?
