Chris,

I believe you said all communications for this customer will be through Pam Carter?  I will be actualizing July soon and will send a file directly to Pam.  If that has changed and I need to add either of these folks, please let me know.

Also, we need to come up with a method wherein they can receive all of the details - currently we can only send a total tab via e-mail.  Let me know what shared folder you can access, or if you have another option.

Caroline

Caroline,

In an effort to make better accruals and analyze our numbers, can you provide the ISO charges for EEMC and EES, both estimates and actuals, as they occur?  I think Accounting was originally on the distribution list, but with turnover we seem to be missing them monthly.  Please send them to Troy Klussmann, who will be the point person on this.  Thanks!

Laura

Attached is the summary file of the ancillary, other and penalty charges for EES and EEMC from Sept 00 to June 01 (different levels of detail on each tab).
