Chris,

We received the following four data files from EPMI on Wednesday, 08/08/01.
epmi_epmi_20010429_003.dat	Trade date 04/29/01	Received 08/08/01 16:10 Was this data file sent in error?  Should it have been for trade date 06/29/01?  Let me know if we can disregard this file.
epmi_epmi_20010625_003.dat	Trade date 06/25/01	Received 08/08/01
16:11
epmi_epmi_20010628_002.dat	Trade date 06/28/01	Received 08/08/01
16:12
epmi_epmi_20010630_001.dat	Trade date ???????  	Received 08/08/01 20:52 Assumed to be for trade date 06/30/01 by file naming convention, but unable to view the contents of this data file.  I suggest you either submit a request to review what we have for trade date 06/30/01 (if this is the correct date) or resend for trade date 06/30/01.
Please advise as soon as possible regarding the status of the above mentioned files.  I also wasn't sure if the data files EPMI sent were for trade dates only for those listed above or perhaps they should have sent 06/26/01 & 06/27/01 as well.  Thanks.
