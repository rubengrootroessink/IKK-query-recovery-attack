Please respond to Hey Chris
That book I mentioned to you is titled, "BLUR: the speed of change in a
connected economy". As a matter of fact, you can just go to the books
website and find almost all of the relevant content.

It sure was great talking to you. We have to take the time to talk more
often.

Take care,
Kerry
