What's up Chris?  I haven't heard from you in a while.  I don't know how things are going to pan out with the re-org, but I think the re-org is being done out of necessity.  I don't know who Don Black is.  I know that when he came in, Dennis Benevides reported to him.  He moved Dennis off of the Power Desk and put Neil Bresnan in charge.  Obviously, his role has expanded.  Will your group be reporting to him now?

Rick Baltz was our Director when Derenda and I left.  He has since moved over to work for Evan Hughes.  Mary Lynn Ruffer is now over the group.  George Phillips is managing the settlements/volume control function.  At least this is my understanding. 

I think Derenda will be a much happier person wherever she is going.  It's too bad that she had to get a raw deal in order for her to find happiness, but that's the way the world works sometimes.

So what all are you going to be doing over the next 6 months?  Is it strictly related to volume management?  Is it only related to the West?  Maybe we can grab some lunch when you come to Houston.  Talk to you later.

Wayne

Wayne,
	What do think of the latest re-org and the e-mail we got from Derenda. Do you have any insight into what is going on over in the EES world. It looks like I will be on the team that helps sort all of this out and I wanted to see if you had any knowledge on Don Black. Also, who is the gentleman that caused you and Derenda so much grief? I guess this all worked out well for you in the end, since you won't have to sweat all of the decisions that are about to take place for that area of the business. I more than likely will be in Houston quite a bit over the next 6mts, so I will swing by and visit with you and Chad when I find out my schedule. Hope all is going well, Derenda told me that you were enjoying your job.



							Chris
