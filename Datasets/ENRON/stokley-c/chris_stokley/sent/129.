Jim,
	We are missing one significant piece of info in this document. We need to add the charges associated Positive and Negative  Load Deviation (Penalty Charges). I don't think that there are any for Positive Dev., but I know that there are charges associated to Neg. Dev.

Harvey had created the above document that shows the ISO Charges that occur due Firm and Non-Firm Imports and Exports and Load.  I had Keoni look it over and edit Harvey's file...And here is the version not showing Keoni's edits.
