		     Thanks Chris, I am really hoping to have all of the
audit plan
		     correspondence completed by Wednesday because I am
taking three weeks
		     off of
		     work.  So, I would really appreciate it if you could
get the audit
		     plan to
		     me as soon as possible.  Thanks for getting back to me
and let me know
		     if
		     you have any other questions or hold up.  Thanks again.

		               Jeanette,
		                    Sorry I am so late in getting back w/
you on this
		     topic. We had
		               a mix up w/ AA that had to get worked out but
I think we are
		     clear to go
		               forward. I have the Audit Plan from AA so I
will give them
		     my comments
		               and send it to you by tomorrow.




		               Chris
