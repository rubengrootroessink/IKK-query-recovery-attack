Jennifer,
	I will need to know what the volume totals you are expecting in each of the hours listed below. Please send your comparison of what was expected by EES  vs what you received from EPMI. 
						             Thanks

Chris, 
thanks for sending these files promptly.  However, there are a couple of zones and hours I need you the check in the EES file as the volume look a little inconsistent when compared to hours before and hours after. 


Please check the following:

Date		Zone		Hour
4/1		PGE1		14, 17 & 18

4/4		PGE1		11, 13 & 17
		PGE2		11
		PGE3		11&12
		SCE1		1, 11 - 17

4/5		PGE2		2-5

4/7		PGE3		13-15 & 18

4/11		PGE2		2-6
		PGE3		2-6 & 24
		SCE1		4, 5 & 24

Please let me know if  you have any questions.


Thanks again,

Pam
