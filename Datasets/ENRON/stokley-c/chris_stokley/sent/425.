s Bar Date

IMPORTANT NOTICE
UNDERSCHEDULING PENALTY AND
PG&E BANKRUPTCY PROOF OF CLAIMS
As you are aware, the claims bar date in the PG&E bankruptcy is September 5=
th.  Consistent with our practice of providing information held by the ISO =
to Market Participants that concerns the amounts that may be owed to them i=
n part by PG&E, the ISO is today sending to each Scheduling Coordinator an =
accounting of the amounts it owes or is owed in the event the underscheduli=
ng penalty is not modified by FERC.  FERC adopted the underscheduling penal=
ty in a December 15, 2000 Order.  Because there are several rehearing petit=
ions pending regarding the underscheduling penalty, to date the ISO has cal=
culated but has not invoiced amounts owed or owing pursuant to the undersch=
eduling penalty.  It is our expectation that Scheduling Coordinators will s=
hare with individual entities for whom they schedule, information that is r=
elevant to them.
As we have advised in prior Market Notices, although the ISO settles transa=
ctions on behalf of Market Participants, the ISO is neither authorized nor =
in a position unilaterally to assert claims on behalf of Market Participant=
s in any bankruptcy proceeding, i.e. assert claims of "ISO Debtors" against=
 "ISO Creditors" (ISO Tariff Section 11.20.1).  Further, while the ISO may =
be asked by an "ISO Debtor" to assert such claims in the PX or PG&E bankrup=
tcy cases, the ISO is not obliged to do so and will decline any such reques=
t.  The ISO expressly disavows any liability for any Market Participant's c=
laims, whether or not the Market Participant files any such proofs of claim=
 in the PX or PG&E bankruptcy proceedings.  Further, as we have advised in =
prior Market Notices, all statements, including the information sent today =
regarding the underscheduling penalty, are subject to change.  A number of =
transactions are currently known to be the subject of disputes and market r=
eruns.  There are also proceedings pending at FERC, Federal Courts, and Sta=
te Courts, the outcomes of which may affect amounts owed by PG&E to each Ma=
rket Participant or by the Market Participant to PG&E. In addition, we anti=
cipate that further disputes and proceedings may arise and market reruns ma=
y be performed that will affect the calculation of such amounts.  The ISO w=
ill continue to work diligently to resolve these matters as quickly as poss=
ible.  Nonetheless, it is clear that significant issues may remain unresolv=
ed and/or unidentified by the claims bar date.
Market Participants should consult their own legal COUNSEL as to their resp=
ective rights  and proofs of claims in the bankruptcy cases of the PX and P=
G&E.
