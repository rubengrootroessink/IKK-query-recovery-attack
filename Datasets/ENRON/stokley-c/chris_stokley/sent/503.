Actually, that was per my request when I was working on the intra-month book. However, I was wondering if it is possible to get the data loaded into MDMA on a daily basis so we can pull from their.

Chris, you requested a copy of the MV90 report for Meter Operations. This report can be found at L:/EESO/MV90/EXPORTS/DAILY MV90 EXTRACTS/. This report was set up several months ago on the Enron/CSC shared drive per the request of Mike Frazier and Maurice Winter. Please let me know if you have any issues locating the report. If you have any questions about the report you can reach Pat Priestley or Di'onne Williams of CSC at 713-632-8508 or 713-632-8750 respectively. 

We look forward to meeting with you on Wednesday at 11:00. The agenda is to discuss Meter Operations including the ISO audit and arrangements for a metering workshop for Enron and CSC. Meeting room is 1170 at the Enron building. 

Thanks, Cara Tammaro, CSC
