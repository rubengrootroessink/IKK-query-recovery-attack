Greetings, attached is an excel spreadsheet that lists the 5 highest UFE

days broken out by demand zones and for all trade days during the audit

period.  We though this might be a useful piece of information for you as

you begin picking your sample days for testing SQMD.  We have put this

spreadsheet together strictly as information to provide to you.

We are already at the half way mark of the audit period and wanted to again

extend our services if any of you have any questions or concerns that you

would like to discuss, please feel free to contact either myself or Glen

Perez at gperez@caiso.com < <mailto:gperez@caiso.com>> , 916-325-2135.
