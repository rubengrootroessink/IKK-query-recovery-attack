Pamela,
	Where do you get the numbers for the EEMC tab? Here are the stages of the process that I currently know about:
	
		1) EES sends the schedule  file to the EPMI server
		2) Calf. schedulers pull EES schedules into their portfolio and submit the information to the ISO.
		3) ISO sends back Day Ahead Finals (Changes could occur with EES original schedule)
		4) ISO Sends back Hour Ahead Finals (Changes could occur with EES schedule from the Day Ahead Market)

	As you can see, there is quite a few places that changes can occur to an EES schedule in the course of a day. So I am trying to follow the information flow on both the EES side and the EPMI side. If the only schedule you see is the one that is originally sent to the  EPMI server, then I can see where we have the potential to have many unexplained variances. If this is the case, this may be nothing more than providing you with the incremental information that is provided by the ISO during the course of a given day. Just update me on your process flow, and I will keep this issue moving along until completion.

								Thanks
								  Chris

Chris,  the spreadsheet below contains the HA_Finals that you send to me(EPMI) as well as the scheduled volumes sent from the scheduling group(EES).  The volumes on the EPMI tab is inconsistent with the EEMC tab.  Please review the variance sheet tab which will denote the days, zone and hours where the difference occur.    I am assuming the EPMI numbers are incorrect because of the hour by hour consistency on the EEMC  spreadsheet.  However,  this assumption could be incorrect.   Again, please review and let me know. 

Thanks,

Pam
