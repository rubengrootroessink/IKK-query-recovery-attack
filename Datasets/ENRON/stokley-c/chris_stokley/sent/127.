Remember how bad T.A. reported that we all were on putting cuts into the system, enpower work,  reconciliation,  etc. ? 

THESE GUYS DO NONE OF THAT - NO ONE EVEN KNOWS HOW.   

Settlements is working hard,  but TA doesnt say a word to the RT traders here,  as it would be political suicide.     That's why she turned toward us.
She is supposed to be our rep to the ISO,   and I talked to her,   explaining my expectations.   She was squirming  about saying that she or Rebecca wouldnt know the answers.   Im cool with that,  but cant you find out?   Everything is such a big struggle here.

Im not coming until February at the earliest.    I am an Oregonian.
The freaking mosquitos are terrible now that the floodwaters have subsided.  I forgot about that bit of joy.

Later,
