Sorry bud,
	I appreciate you taking the time to e-mail me. I am in town every week, why don't you I and Kerry go and grab a bite to eat. I would love to swing by and see the family. It is awesome to hear how well things are going for you and now Kerry. My cell number is 503-807-8959 and my Houston number is 345-6120



										Chris

Well just wanted to drop you a line and say Happy Birthday.

Hope your hands heal soon.  I assume you haven't responded to my emails
because you probably broke both hands and can't type right now.
