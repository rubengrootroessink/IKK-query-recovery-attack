I will look into what timeline that we can get these guys paid on and talk with you today. As far as the other issue, we are no where close to being able to take that project on. The current new hires are just to get us caught up in the short term. After that, then it may be a do able item, but right now all I want the new guys concentrating on is getting us caught up. I see this hand-off taking place sometime in the 3rd qtr of this year, when we get the rest of our staff in place.

Chris,

I just received a call from Willamette Ind. concerning our future business. It seems Aquila is making a proposal for Willamette's business. 
Willamette is reasonably satisfied with their Enron relationship with the exception of the time it takes for Enron to settle California business.  They mentioned that timely settlement of the outstanding balances for November and December would be helpful in discussions with their upper management.

I'm confident that Enron will retain Willamette's business, but it would be extremely helpful if we can get them paid for CISO business for November and December before the end of April. 

Let me know what Volume Management needs from Services to get Willamette paid for Nov. and Dec.

On another topic, with your new hires coming soon can we shift the settlements for Services Customers, like we've discussed, to Volume Management?


Regards,


Les Rawson
