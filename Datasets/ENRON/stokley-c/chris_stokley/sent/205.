Chris, 

This wire payment of $497,076 for Willamette has been set up for payment on Monday, 5/7/01.  We were trying to set it up for payment today, but Treasury encountered system problems while interfacing to the bank.  Please let me know if you have any further questions. 

Thanks, Melissa

Melissa,
	The payments that we need to send out to these counter parties are listed below. These payments are being made based off of our estimates for both the month of Nov. and Dec. The Nov. payment is being calculated at 23 cents on a dollar (Due to the ISO short-pay) while the Dec. payment is dollar for dollar.  We will then actualize both Nov. and Dec before the close of the May accounting month. Please give me call if you have any questions on this topic.
