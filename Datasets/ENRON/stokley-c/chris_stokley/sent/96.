Actually, I think the settlements group would have to have this number at an aggregate level to be able to potion FERC.

I would have to go into each spreadsheet and make that calculation.  An
example would be for Jan. 1, the total charges were $2,053,504.

I confirmed that since Enron does not deviate from their schedules in
real
time a good portion of the payments have been going to Enron.  It is
still
up in the air what they will do with these charges.
