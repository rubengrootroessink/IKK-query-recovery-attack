Chris, 

We are planning to use the following days to gather data for the ISO audit:

Februay 5, 2000
June 11, 2000
July 15, 2000
August 7, 2000
December 28, 2000

No data is taken from 1999 due to the conversion from CHEOPS to MDMA.
The 5 days represent high UFE days from each quarter of 2000 (see ISO analysis).
July 15 and August 7 were included on the resubmittal analysis you provided.
December 28 is an "exit" sample from the audit period.

Please respond with any concerns or comments.

Thanks,

Ken
