Kristian,

	I apologize for  not doing a better job of staying in touch the past few months. I have been flying into Houston every week for the past two months, which is getting quite old. I am not sure what will come of this project, but so far I am still dealing w/ Settlement issues. I hear that things are going a lot better for you since we last spoke, promotion, your own book, etc. Monica seems to also be doing quite well in her new role in origination. She did have time to give me shit for not doing a better job of staying in touch. I told her to go slap you in the head and make you install Instant Messenger on your Computer, so please do so. It is about the only way that I get a chance to communicate  w/ anyone these days including my family. 

										Chris
