Yes, this is a new show, not to be confused with Quidam which they did the
last time they were in Houston.  Now here's how I think we should handle
this.  Instead of your preferred date, respond to me by tomorrow with the
dates you are NOT available and I'll pick a date that avoids as many
scheduling conflicts as possible.  The deal that my company is offering
requires the purchase of fifteen tickets for a given performance.  If they
don't get 15, then we'll be offered an alternative date.  Tickets are $60
each.  Let me know if you are interested in going and how many tickets you
want by tomorrow and I'll put it all together as a single order.  You can
send me a check at the address below.

Can you say CIRCUS!
