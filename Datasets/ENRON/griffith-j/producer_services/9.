Sandy, we are still finalizing the contract and expected volumes with Cabot 
Oil & Gas Marketing Corporation for the two Terrebonne Parish deals 
referenced above, but we expect to enter into a long term deal prior to the 
end of December.  Would you please re-confirm that the notional pricing set 
forth in your 11/13/2000 memo for the two Cabot Terrebonne Parish deals is 
still valid for 5 years firm out of January 2001 for 80% of the volumes cited 
in my original request .  Thanks.
