George/Sandy, 
Are you guys nominating/confirming this gas on Tennessee Passkey and Transco 
Transit for December or are we?  
Are there going to be two sets of tickets for each deal (one for the firm 
volume and one for the swing)?  We'll need those deal numbers when you have 
them.. 
Are you scheduling this internally in Unify or are we? 
Please let me know as soon as possible as noms for December 1 are due to the 
pipelines by 11:30 this Thursday morning!  THANKS!

Sandy,

Attached are the tickets we intend to submit to document the two (2) deals 
with Cabot for December.  Once you and John have had an opportunity to review 
these tickets, Melissa and I would like to come down and walk them through 
the system.  Thanks.

Cabot has agreed to do the December deals at index minus $0.01 for 80% of 
their volume and gas daily minus $0.01 for the remaining 20% of their 
volume.  We expect that they will soon execute the long term paper providing 
for index minus $0.005 for the 80% firm traunch and gas daily minus $0.005 
for the 20% spot traunch; a set of new long term tickets will be prepared and 
submitted upon execution of the long term paper.

If this mechanism of documenting our deals works, we intend to submit all 
future deals in a similar manner.

George x3-6992
