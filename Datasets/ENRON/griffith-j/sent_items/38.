Greg,

I want to thank you so much for all you work on the trade blotter.  We are getting close here.  I put together a list of items to get the thing completely operational.  Below is the list and maybe we could talk today to discuss.  Thanks.

BLOTTER

 - rearrange the deal input screen
 - have Amy's sheet pull deals from access database
 - get Mike Maggi's computer set up for the access database
 - build a spreadsheet to take a snapshot of the blotter for Mike Maggi
 - set up a default month for the deal input screen (possibly an input on the spreadsheet)
 - have deal input screen popup on the screen that the spreadsheet is open in
 - on morning macro, include clear trades, clear charm, clear theta and clear recon numbers
 - separate price and vol on the Fetch Curves button
 - delete evening macro
 - add button for settle prices
 - add button to print position, pnl, options and swap pages (one button)
 - test multiple user input on the deal input spreadsheet

This list might look like alot, but I think most items will only take a few minutes to correct or change.  Let me know when you get a chance to sit down and talk about this.  Thanks.

John Griffith
