I had a great time working with the best option trading team in the energy industry.  What I have learned from you will benefit me a lot in my future career.

I will start looking for a new job.  If your friends in other trading house are looking for a junior trader, please let me know.

Deep in my heart I want to be part of your team.  Count me in when the new company starts hiring people.  

Sincerely
