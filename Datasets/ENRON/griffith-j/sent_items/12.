Hey Reggie, 

How are you doing?  I don't know if you remember me but I was a friend of Chris Larson's.  I was wondering what you  guys are going to do with the furniture and the flat screens?  Do you need any help selling them?  Will you offer any to the employees?

I know you are busy in these times.  If you get a chance, call me at x.36247 or at home (713) 527-8743.

Thank you and have a great day.  Hope all is well with you and your family.

John Griffith
