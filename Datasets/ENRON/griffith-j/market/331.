Weather Headlines
Monday November 26, 2001


*** Battle continues between Atlantic Ridge and arctic air. The result is a
much stormier pattern for the nation. ***

     The models may still be having problems in timing delivery of arctic
air to the Lower 48, but seem to be doing very well with the increased
storminess. A significant winter storm is in progress for the North with
the Dakota's and Minnesota in line for possible blizzard conditions into
midweek. The Gulf of Mexico opens up for some rain to the South.
Eventually, t-storms and possible severe weather may occur over the SE.
While this occurs, another strong storm slams into the West with more heavy
rain and snow for the region. The Atlantic ridge holds sway over the East
coast and will only grudgingly give way to the onslaught of storms coming
in from the West. We have clearly gone to a winter pattern now in the short
term for the North and West, but it is less clear for the South and East.

     There is no denying the buildup of Arctic air in Canada, whether it
drops South in the 6-10 day forecast time frame is another matter. The
European seems to be the most consistent model in recent days and it does
drop below normal temps in to the Plains and Great Lakes. But, the SE US
ridge is still around as well. My feeling right now is that sustainable
cold in this period will have a tough time moving East. The current
storminess will not be as strong this period, but does not disappear
either. Given that, I look for an above normal period for temperatures in
the South and East and a bit below normal for the North and West.

 For the period Monday November 26 through Friday November 30, expect the
following temperature trends:

Average 4 to 6 below normal: California, Desert SW, Intermountain West,
Rocks, Plains?

Average 1 to 3-degrees below normal: Great Lakes, Mississippi valley,
Pacific NW?

Average 1 to 3-degrees above normal: Ohio Valley, Gulf Coast?

Average 4 to 6-degrees above normal: Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Southeast?
