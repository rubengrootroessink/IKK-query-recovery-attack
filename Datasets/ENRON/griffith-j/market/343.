Weather Headlines
Tuesday November 27, 2001

*** Very stormy pattern for the next few days as Canadian cold interacts
with Atlantic warmth. ***

     A series of strong storms are expected to run through the Continental
U.S. during the five-day period. One has already produced heavy snows in
the Northern Plains and is producing another round of strong t-storms along
the Gulf coast. The cold air has pushed far enough South through the Plains
to produce some snows into Northern Texas today. This cold is having a
difficult time pushing east thanks to a strong SE U.S. ridge. There will be
somewhat of an eastern push later in the week, but with a sizeable
weakening as it occurs. The next in the series of storms for the West mid
to late week appears to be a powerhouse. Rain along the coast will be
measured in inches (primarily from San Francisco North), mountain snows
will be in feet and all of this will be accompanied by strong winds. The
deep trough in the West will keep temperatures all through the region below
to much below normal. The extreme East remains above seasonal norms while
the rest of the country sees a fair amount of fluctuation on daily
temperatures depending upon their location in respect to these storms.

     The 6-10 day period it is safe to say will be less active than the
short range. That's not much of a stretch though given the magnitude of
short-term storms. The overall pattern does not change much with some
degree of trough still expected in the West. We will probably beat down the
SE ridge somewhat this period. It still looks doubtful to me that we would
see any sustainable cold air very far South into the U.S. In fact, the
trend in the arctic regions appears to be one of cooling during this
period. Typically when this happens, the result is one of warming in the
Southern half of Canada. I don't see a major warm up and in fact many areas
of the Lower 48 will be cooler than recent weeks. However, in a relative to
normal sense, I anticipate most areas to run near or slightly above normal
through the first week of December.

For the period Tuesday November 27 through Saturday December 1, expect the
following temperature trends:

Average 4 to 9 below normal: California, Desert SW, Intermountain West,
Rockies, Plains?

Average 1 to 3-degrees below normal: Great Lakes, Mississippi valley,
Pacific NW?

Average 1 to 3-degrees above normal: Ohio Valley, Gulf Coast?

Average 4 to 9-degrees above normal: Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Southeast?
