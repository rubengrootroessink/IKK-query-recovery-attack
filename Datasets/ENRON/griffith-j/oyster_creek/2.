John,

Could you please check whether the following HSC Gas Curve reflects our 
forward forecast about two months ago? (I am not quite sure from Chu Chu's 
model on what exact date he got the curve from the desk.  We believe it is 
about two months ago.)

2001 3.70
2002 3.20
2003 2.96
2004 2.91
2005 2.90
2006 2.91
2007 2.93
2008 2.96
2009 3.00
2010 3.05
2011 3.11
2012 3.19
2013 3.27
2014 3.36

Thanks!

Ying

Ying,

Here are the yearly curves for Houston Ship Channel.  These are indicative 
curves from 11/29/00.  They do not include the trader's bid/offer, or any 
costs that may be incurred in getting the gas to the plant.  
  

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.  Thanks.


John
