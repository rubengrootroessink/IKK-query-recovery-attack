John,

A couple of items - would you mind updating the curves for me so I have the 
most current info before we begin talking with Chase.  Also, I just wanted to 
follow-up on the status of our open items:
Pushkar is on-board and waiting for a contact from Fleet
Credit will still have to be addressed for Stoneville
The margin agreement between Stoneville and ENA will include broad 
rehypothecation procedures

What is the status of (1) accounting, (2) nymex risk books, and (3) basis & 
index books (dummy trade tickets)?  Let me know when you will have a chance 
to look through the model.  Thanks again for all your help.

Mike
