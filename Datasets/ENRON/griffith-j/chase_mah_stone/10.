Mary Lynne,

Just wanted to updated you on the current prepay that is scheduled to close 
next thursday (28th) with Chase and Fleet.  The prepay is anticipated as 
follows:

Total Funds      $330,000,000
Financing Expenses:
 Upfront to Banks $2,582,500
 Surety Bonds  $2,175,670
  Total Fees         $4,758,170

Anticipated Cash Flow    $325,241,830

The anticipated reserve related to ENE cost of funds versus the prepay is  
estimated to be ($130,501) while the timing differential between delivery 
date and settlement date (55 days) is estimated to be ($2,949,879).  Please 
let me know if you have any questions or need any additional information.  
Thanks again for your help.

Michael
