Steph,  Luis valles from Cementos Chihuahua tells me thatit is the El Paso 
Maximum Interruptible rate that Pemex discloses in their final price....Does 
that make sense ? 
I have am eeting in Chihuahua, next tuesday with a group of industrials that 
want us to supply gas in Chihuahua..The idea is to present Enron, to talk 
about all this issues and get information from them regarding their 
consumptions...
Could John come with me to the meting ?  That would be tremendously 
helpful....

Thanks for the information - we now understand how their deal is priced. The 
only rate I am unable to verify is the max int. Permian - Hueco rate of 
$.15819. The El Paso tariff shows $.1936, exclusive of surcharges (GRI and 
ACA). Can  you please ask where that rate comes from?

Hello guys, hope you had a great thanksgiving weeked...I receiven this email 
from Cementos Chihuahua, they have facilities y the Ciudad Chihuahua region, 
below Juarez, and I think the information is very valuable...I am meeting 
with them next tuesday to go over possibilities of bringing gas to them in 
the Chihuahua and Samalayucaregion. I think they ar eusing a different 
by-pass than the one for Juarez LDC, but the source should be the same, and 
here is the detail...I'll call you guys tomorrow,,,Thanks and regards.
