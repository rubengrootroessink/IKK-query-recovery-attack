Hi John:

It was nice to hear from you.  I am glad that you and Angie are well.  Chris
just got back from Dallas visiting Jeff and Stacy and saw there new house.
He says that it is going to be fantastic and that they are really well.

Things are busy here too.  I am getting ready for another exhibition to open
at the end of August.  It is on early 20th century design.  I hope you will
get a chance to see it.  Chris is very excited about starting his job on
Monday.  I am really happy for him.

We stopped by Don's shop on SUnday and heard that you had been teh week
before.  We will need to ccordinate our visits so that we can all get
together.

I hope we will see you both soon!
