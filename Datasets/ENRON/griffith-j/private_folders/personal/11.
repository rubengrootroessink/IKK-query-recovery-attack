The lovely and talented Beth Secor, the funny funny Beth Secor, the Beth
Secor we all know and love so much, is moving to Baltimore, MD during
the first week of the New Year. I just don't know how the good part of
Texas will survive without her. Just this year Beth won some prize for
her badass painting at the Lawndale Big Show, and she should've won some
other prize for being so damn funny over the years. So here's the thing:

On Thursday, Dec 21, 7:30 - 9pm at DiverseWorks, Beth is doing her Final
Reading. Tickets are $5 and I think all proceeds go to helping Beth
move. Also, she'll  unload a bunch of her old work from the 80's and
early 90's for $10 -$50 that
night. So go check it out. Man, to get a Beth for $50- that's CRAZY! $10
is just insane.

Seriously, Beth is great. Go see her read her hilarious stuff. Go get a
painting. I SO MUCH wish I could go, but I'll be at work. Oh, here's a
link to a bit of her writing:

Ok. Peace. Love. Al Gore.
