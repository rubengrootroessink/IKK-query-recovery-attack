Hey big brother, how are things going?  Happy New Year and a belated Merry
Christmas to everyone.  I hope that everything is going okay.  I am sorry
that I did not make it to your house for Christmas.  I am very bad about
procrastination and I wait to the last minute on everything.  I do miss you
guys and we will come to stay with you soon.  I hope that you can forgive
me.  I am really sorry.  I love you very much.  We just stayed here and had
a very quite Christmas and New Years.  I did see Mel and Keran.  They
seemed to be okay.  Angie and I drove to Keran's house on Christmas nite.
Everything just happened to quick.  We were not prepared time wise and
financial wise to leave town for Christmas.  How was it?  I guess you had
really bad weather.  Lots of ice and snow?  How is business?  I have been
really busy here.  I didn't take any time off during the holidays.  Being
the new person in the group, I couldn't.  It was really busy.

I love you guys very much and I better get back to work.  I will try to
call you tomorrow afternoon.  Tell everyone hi.

Love you

J Boy.
