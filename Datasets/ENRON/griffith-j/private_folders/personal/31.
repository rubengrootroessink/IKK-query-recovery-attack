Well, yep, I am still alive, I still exist here in LA. This hasn't been
easy, it's not easy, but it hasn't killed me, just given me a recurring
chest cold. It seems that it's only really hard to breathe on the days when
I have something pretty big and pressing to do, like the day before actually
getting the truck, or today when I had to go to Aquent to get tested on my
computer skills, and then wanted to go apply for jobs at 12 different
photo-related businesses (which I didn't do). But on the days that I allow
myself to have fun, it is great.

Last week on Monday I went to Point Dume beach w/ Mark Allen and his friend
Elyse, and we had a great time. Of course the water and the day were way too
cold to go swimming, but we hiked up a cliff overhanging the water, where
surfers were trying to catch the 9-15 foot waves. I got pictures of them,
and photo'd Mark and Elyse walking through the crazy daisies that grow
bushlike out of the top of 2.5' sticks in the sand. Then on Sat., I went
hiking by myself in Griffith Park, which is literally up the street from our
house. Griffith Park is a big park in the Hollywood Hills, maybe (I'm not
sure) where the Hollywood sign is. Sort of a California version of Central
Park, with mountains and a whole lot more wild. (From our apartment, we can
see the "lly" and "d" of the Hollywood sign, mostly obscured by palm trees.)
So I was walking along this dirt fire road, amazed at the solitude and
immensity of the nature, my head being buzzed by an annoyed bee or
something, when I turned a corner and saw a huge chunk of LA in front of me.
I'm still too new here to be able to know exactly what I was looking at, but
way in the distance I could see jets taking off from LAX, I think. Closer
was Hollywood, where I live. There were some tall buildings that I think
were the Melrose area, and way in the distance, I could see these buildings
that were backlit from the light reflecting off the ocean. The Ocean. The
Pacific. I could see the PACIFIC from the MOUNTAINS by my house. It is
amazing. Okay, maybe they're technically hills, since I could walk up them
following the trails, but they are definitely mountains to me. Besides, you
can practically walk up Everest, w/ oxygen.
We've gone to art openings, had fun there, gone to parties, had fun there,
too. Can't find really good, really cheap beer here like Pearl, yet, but
I'll keep trying. The Food for Less has a twenty-pack of Budweiser for
$9.98, just 50? a beer. Went to two music shows this last week, at two
different places, and was able to bring my camera in, no problem.
I still haven't processed any film here yet, still way too broke to do it.
I've got about 18 or 19 rolls shot so far, some of it from before I left
Houston. I'll probably process the film even though I "can't afford it", cuz
I'm thinking I might be able to use some of the photos in my portfolio,
which I can use to make me some big money. Gotta spend money to make it,
gotta believe it's worth it, cuz it is. It's easy to believe in my head,
but's harder to get off the couch. I'm still trying to get the guts to go
through all my photos and put together my portfolio. I was out today, had
just filled out a simple application at a camera store (my first), when I
realized I was carrying around my graphics portfolio, and none of my photos.
So I bought some ice cream and came home.
I miss you guys. Tell me how you are. Write to me, email me, call me.
Instant message me, even. Jody is not enough for me, I need other friends.
Remember that I'm two hours behind you, and I stay up really late, so you
can call me at 4am there and I'm still not even home from the bar yet. I
expect every single one of you to move out here one day. Don't forget about
me when I make it big.
