Hey there everybody. I went to the doctor today and they said the 
pathology of my neck stuff was clear, so as far as they know I'm free 
of cancer. So no radiation, but I do get to keep the pirate scar and 
my fetching new lisp, both of which are already attracting 
appreciative notice from the ladies.
I'm relieved of course, and also totally bewildered. I  feel like a 
giant tidal wave swept over me this month and is now heading back out 
to sea. I'll contact you all individually once I get some of the 
saltwater, starfish, and barnacles out of my hair and underpants. 
Thanks for all your positive thoughts and wishes.
Love
Mark
