Hello, Sweetness! Sorry I didn't get back to you right away. You guys should
come here! It is awesome! Jody, Eric Neibhur, and I drove up into the
mountains on Sunday and played in the snow. It was awesome. We got there in
less than an hour after stopping twice to look at the view. I tried to make
a snow angel, but it was more of an ice angel, really. Neither Jody nor Eric
had gloves, so they weren't too keen on making snowballs and throwing them
at me. Still, we had a great time.

Sat. we went to see this performance group Fischerspooner in sort of the
equivalent of the Rice Hotel while it was under construction. They wore
crazy costumes and danced around and sang over djed music. It was pretty
cool, especially since we snuck in the back door, even though it was free,
since we didn't have reservations. (I made an animation of it. I'm trying to
figure out how to put it online for y'all!) Then we went to Chinatown for
art openings, and that was really cool. Then we went to a renovated bowling
alley to see a secret show by Kim Deal, but she didn't play cuz supposedly
Kelly Deal got married that day. But there was an alright band w/ the most
Amazingly cute girl singer, so it all good.

So you guys have to come here! Come here! C'mere!

See yu on Fri at Jessica's opening at Lawndale, then on Sat at the wedding.
Yeah!!!!!

xoxoxox,
Al Herrmann
