BMC was able to get us the 23 tickets for the 19th.  These will be Category
2 seating which I've been guaranteed is great.  It seems that Category 1
seating has been scooped up by season ticket holders and other groups that
also had early purchase opportunities - BMC alone is ordering over 500
tickets for its employees with our 23 tickets included in that number.
Anyway, these tickets are $50 instead of $60 so those of you who have
already put your checks in the mail will get a refund from me at some point.
In the meantime, we can all mark up our calendars for the 19th of January.

Cheers,
cb
