Nope, not this time around.  No movie star.
Other then the work stuff, things are going well for me too.
I'm glad to hear that all is well for you (ferrarri and all...).  Do you
think they'll give me a car too if I
work for them?
In regards to space, I know what you mean.  I needed so much that I am no
longer married.  It was
not an easy decission or thing to do, but definetely the right one.  I've
been living in South Beach
for the past 8 months and lived with my mom for a little while before that.
Butch is doing well.  He is not reporting to Pedro anymore.  He is under a
new manager under
Ana doing web stuff.  He's been working extremely long hours and under a
lot of preassure.
They had to release new hardware.  I don't think things went very well.
I'll let him know you say hi.

Anyway...I'll call you next week and for sure you will be the 2nd, or maybe
third to know if I make it
out to Houston.

Don't work too hard.

Did they think that you were a movie star at the Sushi Bar?  How are things
going?  It is good to here from you.

I haven't travelled at all, I am now trading natural gas options here at
Enron.  I have been really busy.  I get into work around 6:15 and work
until about 6 on the evening.  I don't even leave my desk for lunch.  They
bring it to me.  I only have a chance to leave my desk for the special
things (haha).

I hope that you are well.  I still miss Florida and all my Floridian
buddies, but things are going well here.  My job is going really well
(promotion, big bonus, company ferrarri....).  Just kidding about the car.
But really everything is going well.  I just miss getting away.  Marriage
is good, but I think that everyone needs their space sometimes (you know
what I mean).

Well I better go.  Call me sometime. My work number is (713) 853-6247.  If
you every make it to Houston be sure to let me know.  Talk to you soon.

John

PS  How is Butch doing?  Tell him hi
