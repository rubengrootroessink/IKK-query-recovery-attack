You always said that we would end up working together at some stage...

Actually I've just logged into the mail system here in London were I'm currently working on a project with Enron Metals Trading, still employed by Cap Gemini Ernst & Young though. What's Houston like? Hot as usual I guess and Enron keeps you busy, or? I've been doing a fair bit of travelling around Europe lately so London actually feels just like a short distance and a nice place to be since everybody speaks english and working with Enron is a challangening task. This is going to be an interesting project.

Back home life goes on and I got married last october. We really enjoy our house and in that sence it's a pity to be away so much, but you can't have it all, can you :-)

Got to go! Cheers!
