I am compelled to write a note on this last tumultuous week. It is hard to
believe it is less than a week. It has been a horrific nightmare here in New
York. You can imagine that it is hard to think, work, and smile at a time
like this. But my feeling is that everything we do as human beings if for
each other, for  our public memory and psyche. We create to nurture
enjoyment, pleasure, and experience. I think that we must consider our
evanescent lives and contribute love and peace in everything we touch, do,
and breathe.

I hope for world peace and world love. I send my regards and prayers to
everyone, my friends, my colleagues and everyone that was touched by this
tragedy. I have lost some friends in this catastrophe and it hurts, but more
importantly I am concerned about us as a collective race, as a civility. We
need to start loving each other and forge ahead and create beauty for
everyone.

Be the change you want to see in the world (Ghandi)


Love and kisses, Karim
