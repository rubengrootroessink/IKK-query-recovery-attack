Hey John!
 
How's it going?
 
Thought I'd send you guys images from the show at  Mark Moore in Santa Monica. They and the installation turned out really good,  and I hope they ask me to show again.
 
Try to get these to Angie as well.
 
Let me know how you guys are doing. And hope to see  you around.
 
Later, Todd
 
PS: can you give me Angie's email...I don't want to  get it wrong again.
