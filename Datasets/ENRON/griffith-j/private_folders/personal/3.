Good to hear things are moving. I heard about the Dynegy deal. Things change
quickly sometimes, eh?

Married life's getting better and better. Bonita, my wife, is working since
half a year, and we've moved into a house in Arlington, a short subway-ride
from the office. At one point, we were actually considering moving to
Houston. We even spent a weekend looking for a house. But we changed our
mind, it just wasn't worth the effort, mostly because we're planning to move
back to Stockholm next summer. Starting to get homesick I guess...

You're right in that I'm working with Jeff Young. He's not directly my boss,
but we're in the same group. I report to Jeff Hunter, he's now the practice
leader for the Energy Risk Management group. The corporate structure that
you knew about is very different from today. When we last met, I worked for
Cap Gemini Hagler Bailly, and the Europeans were all from Cap Gemini. Since
then, CGHB has been dissolved (when Cap Gemini bought Ernst & Young
Consulting), and I went on to Hagler Bailly, that eventually got acquired by
PA Consulting Group. I still have some contact with Anders Ryrfeldt (his
wife is expecting a baby in December) at the energy team at Cap in
Stockholm, most of the other guys have moved on.

PA has been doing quite well so far through this downturn. We're in the
black, and have not layed anyone off. The last half year has been pretty
hectic, with work at Shell and El Paso as well as speaker slots at few
conferences. Have also got a couple of articles published, in the September
issue of the Risk Desk and the December issue of Energy & Power Risk
Management (EPRM).

I'll give you a call next time I go to Houston.

Everything is going okay.  Dynegy has bought us out.  I think that if I was
still in structuring then I might be worried, but I am trading natural gas
options and the desk I work for has been very profitable.  I think that the
natural gas and power trading floors are the main reason they bought us.  I
would think they would like to keep things as they are on these desks, but
you never know.  It will take 6-9 months before anything happens.

How are you doing?  I haven't heard from you in a while.  I would love to
get together sometime.  My phone number is (713) 853-6247.  Call me
sometime.

I guess you are working for Jeff Young now?  He used to be my boss.  How is
the Europe group?  Are they still the same?  I am not for sure how your
company is set up now.

How is married life?  Is you wife in the US now?  Are you still in DC?

Talk to you soon.

John

   Hey John,

   Been following the latest development of your firm. Hope everything
   turns
   out well in the end.

   Would be fun to meet up for a drink some time. I'm in Houston on a
   regular
   basis.

   Hope all is well
