Item Description :
NO RESERVE! This RARE , OUT-OF-PRINT , DELETED and HARD-TO-FIND 1990 Original 
CD (NOT a cd-r) by REVENGE (Revenge : Bassist Peter Hook of New Order and 
Monaco - best known for their hit " What Do You Want From Me ? " from their 
CD " Music For Pleaseure .") album CD titled ONE TRUE PASSION (New Order has 
been one of the most successful British musical imports since "Blue Monday" 
stormed American dancefloors in 1983. After a series of successful albums 
such as Low-life (1985), Brotherhood (1986), and Technique (1989), the band 
took an extended hiatus in the early '90s, with each member pursuing solo 
projects. Vocalist Bernard Sumner teamed up with the Smiths' Johnny Marr to 
form Electronic, Gillian Gilbert and Stephen Morris recorded under the 
moniker the Other Two, and bassist Peter Hook released One True Passion in 
1990 as a member of Revenge.
Each of the New Order side projects took a decidedly different route. 
Sumner's Electronic was essentially a variation of New Order's catchy blend 
of dance and rock, while Morris and Gilbert's the Other Two came across like 
a lighter version of Everything but the Girl. Revenge incorporated elements 
of industrial into what was basically New Order's signature sound. 
Unfortunately, the result was less than satisfying, not due to the harsher 
tone, but for the lack of melody. Bearing ridiculous titles like "Surf Nazi" 
and "Fag Hag," the material on One True Passion is ultimately suffocated by 
bombastic arrangements. While Hook's vocals are remarkably similar to 
Sumner's, Revenge shows no trace of the ingenious instrumentation and 
engaging melodies that helped make New Order (along with Depeche Mode and the 
Cure) one of the most endearing British imports of the 1980s. Even the two 
best cuts on the album, "Pineapple Face" and "Slave," sound forced and 
over-arranged. Hook's distincti!
ve!
bass playing is also noticeably missing, replaced by an overabundance of 
synthesizers.) is in Excellent Playable Condition with awesome pictures
