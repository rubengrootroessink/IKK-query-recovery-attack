Dear Ken,

I spoke to Michcon regarding their gas city gates.

They have over 100 connection points in the state. The nearest ones to
Gibraltar (although they will transport it from anywhere because the gas
loses its identity when it is mixed with other gas
already in the pipes) are:

Panhandle.... River Rouge
ANR...........Willow Run
Great Lakes Transmission....Belle River

I am still arranging to get the Pickling invoices. How many months do you
need?

Regards

Tony Wilson
