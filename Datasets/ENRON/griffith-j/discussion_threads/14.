Will, consistent with the tickets we provided you earlier today, you entered 
the following deals with the volumes indicated in the column "11/28/00 
Tickets":


Tennessee    11/28/00    10/26/00
     Tickets    Quote

Baseload
Cabot:  #505762    11,280     9,136
D2D:  #505910

Swing:
Cabot:  #505855    2,820     2,284
D2D:  #505913

Transco

Baseload
Cabot:  #505870    14,720     14,400
D2D:  #505892

Swing
Cabot:  #505880    3,680     3,600
D2D:  #505902


But, the volumes cited in the tickets prepared today were not consistent with 
the volumes for which the East Desk originally provided price quotes based on 
the volumes we cited on 10/26/00.  I have spoken with Scott Neal and he is 
agreeable to allowing us to amend the Sitara deals to reflect the 10/26/00 
volumes rather than the 11/28/00 volumes.  Please, therefore, substitute the 
Quoted volumes for the Ticketed volumes on the 8 deals listed above.  Thanks 
much.

I have prepared and attach herewith revised tickets.

Jeff,

Following my discussion with Bob Hall earlier today, we've changed the two 
desk-to-desk tickets to reflect the full 100% volume - 14,100 Mmbtu/d on 
Tennessee and 18,400 Mmbtu/d on Transco.  A set of six tickets - 3 for each 
deal - is attached.   Please enter these tickets into Tagg and Sitara, or 
advise me if you require additional documentation.  Thanks.

THESE TICKETS BECAME OBSOLETE AT 2:47 PM

1)  Is this deal done?  No, not yet.  Cabot is reviewing our new Enfolio long 
term contract and has suggested some minor modifications.  Also, this new 
long term contract form is awaiting final Legal Department approval - we 
expect this imminently.  Finally, our reservoir engineers are scheduled to 
visit Cabot's offices on 12/5/2000 to review their downhole data - we will 
not enter into a long term contract until a full reserve review has been 
completed.  
2)  What is the firm quantity?   The quantitiy should be fixed.  For 
December, the firm quantity on Tennessee is 11,280 Mmbtu/d, or 80% of the 
14,100 Mmbtu/d we expect to flow.  The firm quantity on Transco is 14,720 
Mmbtu/d, or 80% of the 18,400 Mmbtu/d we expect to flow.  We intend to keep 
the desk whole on these firm quantities.
3)  Who is communcating with Cabot from a logisitics/volume management point 
of view?  We expect to communicate with Cabot from a logistics/volume 
management point of view. 
4)  Why are we nominating ( instead of ENA Upstream) and which group is 
responsible for balancing on Tenn and Transco?  We intend to do whatever is 
necessary to get the gas to pipeline pooling points and thereupon turn it 
over to each Desk's logistics team.  We do not see the need to duplicate our 
existing logistics function.

Victor,

Are you guys nominating/confirming this gas on Tennessee Passkey and Transco 
Transit for December or are we?  We expect that as the deals are entered into 
Sitara, you will be asked to nominate and confirm this gas.

Are there going to be two sets of tickets for each deal (one for the firm 
volume and one for the swing)?  We'll need those deal numbers when you have 
them..  Actually, we've prepared 3 deal tickets for each deal.  One ticket is 
for the 80% firm purchase (first of the month index pricing) from Cabot by 
Upstream, the second ticket is for the 20% spot purchase (gas daily pricing) 
from Cabot by Upstream and the third ticket is the desk-to-desk transaction 
in which Upstream sells the 80% firm volume to the East Desk - this is the 
ticket which will generate origination to the Upstream Desk, if applicable.
   
Are you scheduling this internally in Unify or are we?  You are.

Sandy,

Attached are the tickets we intend to submit to document the two (2) deals 
with Cabot for December.  Once you and John have had an opportunity to review 
these tickets, Melissa and I would like to come down and walk them through 
the system.  Thanks.

Cabot has agreed to do the December deals at index minus $0.01 for 80% of 
their volume and gas daily minus $0.01 for the remaining 20% of their 
volume.  We expect that they will soon execute the long term paper providing 
for index minus $0.005 for the 80% firm traunch and gas daily minus $0.005 
for the 20% spot traunch; a set of new long term tickets will be prepared and 
submitted upon execution of the long term paper.

If this mechanism of documenting our deals works, we intend to submit all 
future deals in a similar manner.

George x3-6992
