These are always funny.  Thought you might enjoy them.

The long awaited Darwin  Natural Selection Awards - Criminal Category have 
been released! ?These  awards are given each year to bestow upon that 
individual, who through  isolation by incarceration, has done the most to 
remove undesirable elements  from the human gene pool. 

RUNNER-UP # 9 Yankton, South Dakota: A woman  was arrested at her stepson's 
Boy Scout meeting. ?While watching a  policeman demonstrate his drug dog's 
ability, the dog found a bag of  marijuana in her purse. 

RUNNER-UP # 8 Colorado Springs: A guy walked  into a little corner store with 
a shotgun and demanded all the cash from the  cash drawer. ?After the cashier 
put the cash in a bag, the robber saw a  bottle of Scotch that he wanted 
behind the counter on the shelf. ?He  told the cashier to put it in the bag 
as 
well, but he refused and said  "Because I don't believe you are over 21." The 
robber said he was, but the  clerk still refused to give it to him because he 
didn't believe him.  ?At this point the robber took his drivers license out 
of 
his wallet  and gave it to the clerk. ?The clerk looked it over, and agreed 
that  the man was in fact over 21 and he put the Scotch in the bag. 
The robber  then ran from the store with his loot. ?The cashier promptly 
called the  police and gave the name and address of the robber that he got 
off 
the  license. ?They arrested the robber two hours later. 

RUNNER-UP # 7 A  woman was reporting her car as stolen, and mentioned that 
there was a car  phone in it. ?The policeman taking the report called the 
phone and told  the guy that answered that he had read the ad in the 
newspaper 
and wanted to  buy the car. ?They arranged to meet, and the thief was 
arrested.  

RUNNER-UP # 6 San Francisco: A man, wanting to rob a downtown Bank of  
America, walked into the branch and wrote "this iz a stikkup. ?Put all  your 
muny in this bag." While standing in line, waiting to give his note to  the 
teller, he began to worry that someone had seen him write the note and  might 
call the police before he reached the teller window. 
So he left  the Bank of America and crossed the street to Wells Fargo. 
After waiting a  few minutes in line, he handed his note to the Wells Fargo 
teller. ?She  read it and, surmising from his spelling errors that he was not 
the  brightest light in the harbor, told him that she could not accept his  
stickup note because it was written on a Bank of America deposit slip and  
that he would either have to fill out a Wells Fargo deposit slip or go back  
to Bank of America. ?Looking somewhat defeated, the man said "OK"  
and left. ?The Wells Fargo teller then called the police who arrested  the 
man 
a few minutes later, as he was waiting in line back at Bank of  America. 

RUNNER-UP # 5 From England: A motorist was unknowingly caught  in an 
automated 
speed trap that measured his speed using radar and  photographed his car. ?He 
later received in the mail a ticket for 40  Pounds and a photo of his car. 
Instead of payment, he sent the police  department a photograph of 40 pounds. 
? 
Several days later, he received  a letter from the police that contained 
another picture ...of handcuffs.  ?The motorist promptly sent the money for 
the fine. 

RUNNER-UP #  4 Drug Possession Defendant Christopher Jansen, on trial in 
March 
in  Pontiac, Michigan, said he had been searched without a warrant. ?The  
prosecutor said the officer didn't need a warrant because a "bulge" in  
Christopher's jacket could have been a gun. ?"Nonsense," said  Christopher, 
who happened to be wearing the same jacket that day in court.  ?He handed it 
over so the judge could see it. ?The judge  discovered a packet of cocaine in 
the pocket and laughed so hard he required  a five minute recess to compose 
himself. 

RUNNER-UP # 3 Oklahoma  City: Dennis Newton was on trial for the armed 
robbery 
of a convenience  store in district court when he fired his lawyer. 
Assistant District  Attorney Larry Jones said Newton, 47, was doing a fair 
job 
of defending  himself until the store manager testified that Newton was the 
robber.  ?Newton jumped up, accused the woman of lying and then said, "I 
should  of blown your (expletive) head off." The defendant paused, then 
quickly  added, "If I'd been the one that was there." The jury took 20 
minutes 
to  convict Newton and recommended a 30-year sentence. 

RUNNER-UP # 2  Detroit: R.C. ?Gaitlan, 21, walked up to two patrol officers 
who were  showing their squad car computer felon-location equipment to 
children in a  Detroit neighborhood. ?When he asked how the system worked, 
the 
officer  asked him for identification. ?Gaitlan gave them his driver's 
license,  they entered it into the computer, and moments later they arrested 
Gaitlan  because information on the screen showed Gaitlan was wanted for a  
two-year-old armed robbery in St. ?Louis, Missouri. 

RUNNER-UP #  1 Another from Detroit: A pair of Michigan robbers entered a 
record shop  nervously waving revolvers. ?The first one shouted, "Nobody 
move!" When  his partner moved, the startled first bandit shot him. 

THE WINNER A  Charlotte, NC, man having purchased a case of very rare, very 
expensive  cigars, insured them against fire among other things. ?Within a 
month,  having smoked his entire stockpile of cigars and without having made 
even  his first premium payment on the policy, the man filed a claim against 
the  insurance company. ?In his claim, the man stated the cigars were lost 
"in  
a series of small fires." The insurance company refused to pay, citing the  
obvious reason that the man had consumed the cigars in the normal fashion.  ? 
The man sued.... ?and won. 
In delivering the ruling the  judge agreeing that the claim was frivolous, 
stated nevertheless that the  man held a policy from the company in which it 
had warranted that the cigars  were insurable and also guaranteed that it 
would insure against fire,  without defining what it considered to be 
"unacceptable fire," and was  obligated to pay the claim. ?Rather than endure 
a lengthy and costly  appeal process the insurance company accepted the 
ruling 
and paid the man  $15,000 for the rare cigars he lost in "the fires." After 
the man cashed the  check, however, the company had him arrested on 24 counts 
of arson.  ?With his own insurance claim and testimony from the previous 
case  
being used against him, the man was convicted of intentionally burning his  
insured property and sentenced to 24 months in jail and a $24,000 fine.
