A woman was very distraught at the fact that she had not  had a date
or
any
sex in quite some time.
She was afraid she might have something wrong with her so  she decided
to
seek the medical
expertise of a sex therapist. Her doctor  recommended that she see the
well-known Chinese sex therapist,
so she went to see him.
Upon entering the examination room, Dr. Chang said, "OK,  take off all
you
crose."
The woman did  as she was told.
"Now, get down and craw  reery, reery fass to odder side of room."
Again, the woman did as she was instructed.
Dr. Chang then said, "OK, now craw  reery, reery fass back to me."
So she  did.
Dr. Chang shook his head slowly and said, "Your probrem vewy bad. You
haf
Ed Zachary Disease.
Worse case I ever see. Dat why you not haf sex or  dates."
Worried, the woman asked  anxiously, "Oh my God, Dr. Chang, what is Ed
Zachary Disease?"
Dr. Chang looked the woman in the eye and replied, "Ed  Zachary
Disease is
when your face
rook  Ed Zachary rike your ass."
