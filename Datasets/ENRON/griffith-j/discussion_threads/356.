Jeremy,

The final checks have been made to the skew evaluation for the ERMS 
Production.
The test post id's that Dave Wei has provided have been check and are correct.

This email is the official request to move the volatility skew evaluation 
into production.

Please contact me with any questions at 713-853-9257
