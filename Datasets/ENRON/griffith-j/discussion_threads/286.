When you have a few minutes, please take a look at the request below.  My 
thoughts are this product is not hedgable.  I'm looking for another opinion 
and I figure you've probably seen everything under the sun.  

I don't need a response today but this week would be great.  Thanks

Phillips Production would like to know if it is possible to do a Financial 
Hedge for both the NYMEX Settle and Basis.  The attached scheudle calculates 
the Basis as a percentage of the NYMEX Settle instead of a traditional 
location basis.   Please review.  

Can the Basis be hedged since it is based on the NYMEX Settle instead of a 
traditional location basis?

Volume:  5,000 - 7,000 per day.
Period is :  Apr01 - Oct01
