Subject: Re: Tenaska Gas management Agreement  

What's the status here? Is the Agency Agreement a gas management contract? 
What is ENA's obligation and who is the point person internally on 
negotiating this? Rick Hill? Does ENA have exposure because this isn't yet 
executed? Please advise. Thanks.
