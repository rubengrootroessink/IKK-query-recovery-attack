John,

I assume that you are working Marsha's values into our analysis of Southern 
Co.'s rate from Zone .  The Southern Co./Sonat transportation contract has 
the following discount rate.  

 Term     Rate
 June 2004 - May 2007   .1973
 June 2007- May 2012   .2219 plus GDP not to exceed 3% in any year
 June 2012 - May 2017   GDP w/no cap not to exceed max rate of $.2663

Max Rate from Zone 1 to 2 is $8.10 or $.2663 which would be the absolute cap 
unless Sonat raised rates during the term of the Southern Co/Sonat contract.

When are we going to meet tomorrow to go over this?  I'm open in the morning 
if ok with you and Breese.

Phil,

as far as incorporating this into a model.
