Hi Julie,

The fee for Market Profile is 70.00 per month per user that requests it.

Thank you,

Becky

Hi Becky,
I just spoke with John Griffith who I believe contacted you earlier
regarding access to Market Profile for CQG.  Can you let me know
what the cost is if he decides to add it?

Thanks,
Julie
