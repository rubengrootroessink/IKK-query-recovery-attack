Included is the updated model for the latest curve.  John - new volumes and 
prices are on the tab "Financing Assumptions."  Pushkar, the nominal cash 
flows are on the tab "Drawdown," Column J.  Sorry for the delay but my 
computer had serious problems last night.  Thanks again and we will talk this 
morning.

Mike
