Hey you two,
?
Yes, this email is business - Lawndale business.? I'm not really accustomed 
to talking business with my friends so let me say right at the beginning that 
should you not be interested in the following, no harm, no foul.? The last 
thing I want to do is create any discomfort but I really think that this 
might be something that you'd be interested in.? 
?
First, I'm organizing a show at Lawndale that will open on March 9th in the 
Main Gallery called Colorforms.? It's going to include 3 painters - 2 from 
Dallas and 1 from New York - and one sculptor - maybe you know her: Jessica 
Halonen?? She's a core fellow.? I'm really excited about the show.? I did 
studio visits with three of the artists this past weekend and they're all 
working on great stuff.? I'm so jazzed about it, that I've been inspired to 
write an essay and I haven't written about art in 6 years!Anyway, I'm trying 
to do something a little more substantial for the gallery notes - more than 
just a folded piece of card stock - and I told Lawndale that I would try and 
fund-raise for it.? I'm mentioning this to you only because you have 
expressed interest in the past in helping out if I am putting any projects 
together.? I'm trying to raise about $250 to cover printing costs.? I'd also 
like to have a DJ at the ! opening - maybe Patrick Phipps - but I need to 
fund-raise for his fee too.? I know you're thinking "what about DJ Grils 
Baloy" and I'd like to do it but I'm thinking that I need to circulate 
amongst the guests at a show that I organized.? 
?
Second, I'm co-chairing Lawndale's Mid-Century Market this year and so I'm 
also fund-raising for it.? There is a formal letter/packet that has been put 
together but I thought I would ask you a little less formally if you're 
interested in supporting the event.? Last year the Market did quite well 
based on booth rentals and admission.? This year we're focusing on increasing 
the number of donors to the event which has traditionally been small.? There 
are several levels of support with varying benefits at each level.? All 
proceeds from the event go directly to Lawndale's operating budget.
?
As you can tell, I've been increasing my involvement with Lawndale, trying to 
help them get through this period of growing pains.? I regret the fact 
that?these events - Colorforms and the Market? - are happening so close 
together purely from an "asking" point-of-view, but they both seem to have 
"John and Angie" written all over them.? However, if this just isn't a good 
time for you to be doing this sort of thing then I completely understand.? 
Nonetheless, I hope that they might pique your interest.? I'll look forward 
to hearing from you.
