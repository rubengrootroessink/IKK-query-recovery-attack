We plan to deliver 5 cargoes on the Heogh Galleon Vessel into Lake Charles 
from the beginning of June 2001 to January 2002.  We will work with CMS and 
the Lake Charles facility to ensure that we can deliver firm daily gas to our 
ENA gas desk from June 1, 2001 to January 31, 2002.  Based on these 
assumptions the daily volume of firm gas delivered to the gas desk by EGM 
will be as follows:
