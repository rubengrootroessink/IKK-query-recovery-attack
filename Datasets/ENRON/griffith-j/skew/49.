I just wanted to say hello and wish you a great day!

 I have this feeling that you will  want to apologize for not being able to
call me this evening.   Don't even mention it, ok?  You have nothing to
worry about with me.   I  want to let you know that I am thinking about
you(always) , and that is why I decided to take a little break from my
studying to write you.  I cannot wait until the next time we are able to
spend time on our own.   I had such a wonderful time talking to you on
Friday.  I did not want it to end, and it made me sad to see you go.  A
phone call from you, however, put a smile right back on my face.

 I want to know everything about you John.  What makes you happy?  What
makes you laugh? What makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside?  What is your
most memorable  moment? What mischief did you and your siblings get into
when you were little? Did you have a  nickname as a child?  Did you ever
have a favorite Aunt or Uncle that would always take you to fun places?
What  were you like as a teenager? May I see a picture of you as a teenager,
lol - I am sure you were just as handsome then as you are now.  Did you have
the same beautiful red hair that you have now?  (Can I run my fingers
through it? j/k - ok, maybe I am not kidding)  I want to know where you
would like to see yourself in 10 years?  Do you believe everyone has a
soulmate?  Have you or do you ever want to give yourself completely to
someone - your heart, your soul? Do you ever want to see "little Johns and
little Janes"  running around? What do you like most about yourself? Do you
have a best friend you know you can count on? What are some of the places
you want to travel to?

 I want to know all of these things and more.   So lets enjoy these few, but
special moments that we already and can continue to  share.  Whether it be a
little smile from across the room, or just a simple hello.   I have all of
the time in the world.   I am not going anywhere.  I will always be right
here.  Close by.

I guess I will end this here - sorry if it was a little long, and sorry if I
"babbled" away - I agree that we females tend to do that sometimes.

I realize it will be Monday morning when you read this and I know it will
probably be a pretty busy morning for you, and me.  I am going back to my
studying now.  I am sure I will be up late again, as usual.

 I can't wait to see you in the morning!   Talk to you soon...
