Scott,

Attached are the two deals we booked last week for Jared.

They are basically identical, with only slight modification on the price for 
June-Sep.  Let me know which deal they want to unwind.  I need to get risk to 
run a mini-book so I can tie it to the model.

I will come up in a few minutes to discuss.

Eric
