John, thank you so much for your help and your leads.
It is strange not having to go into Enron any more. I
have an interview with Salomon Smith Barney on Wed, so
just doing some research and sharpening my interview
techniques. I will keep you posted on my situation as
things change. Thanks again
I am going to send debby and john my resume now
