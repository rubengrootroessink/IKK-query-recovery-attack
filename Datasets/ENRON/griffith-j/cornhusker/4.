John,
I have not heard from Rick on this draft. Did he send it to you? I had 
forwarded the initial draft to you, but we had a meeting and made some 
changes that resulted in this most recent draft. I forwarded it to Rick Hill 
and Darren Farmer for comments and have received none.Copied Rick on my 
earlier email to you to serve as a remeinfer to him. Did you have any 
comments?

I have seen this.  Where do we stand with this draft?  Are we close to coming 
up with a final?  Who are we waiting on?  Please let me know.  Thanks.

John
