Eric (Moon) and John, attached are the tickets for the physical part of the 
Preston VPP deal.  Please work with Will Kelly to have them entered into 
Sitara and provide me with the deal numbers.

Eric (Wardle), we'll need to get contract numbers established for the 
Counterparty Firm Agreement (ECT Merchant Investments) and the Counterparty 
Spot Agreement (St. Mary's Production LLC).  Have either of these agreements 
yet been executed?  If not, should we generate a spot gtc for the St. Mary's 
spot production?

manage the sale, nomination and transport of this production.

Could you please get us a quote to purchase this wellhead gas on a firm basis 
based on the following:

b.  firm purchase and firm transport for 90% of the wellhead volume, starting 
at 90% of 11,567 per day and declining as defined on the last tab labelled 
"Volume" on the spreadsheet attached

c.  gas daily purchase and interruptible transport for the remaining 10% of
