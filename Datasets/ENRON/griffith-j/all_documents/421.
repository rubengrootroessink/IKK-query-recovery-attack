I have an opening at Capp St. Gallery at CCAC April 19 6 p.m.-9pm called
PLOB

PLOB is an enclosed environment created out of hundreds of identical plastic
translucent modules. Each module has a light and single different sound that
are activated from movement.

Plastic Blob is a plob -
A plob is the state between liquid plastic and solid material object.
A Plob is a noun, but is also a verb. I plob in a state of endlessness.
Capp Gallery is turned into a non-stop amorphous plastic scape that denotes
a world with no boundaries - The space extends itself via plastic organic
modules of repetition d a continuum of surface based on a conventional
Cartesian grid. Plob is a metaphor for a continuous world, a neutral
landscape, and an undulating surface that is reconfigurable and sizable ad
infinitum.

The lightweight plastic moldings are rearrangeable abstractions that are a
growth from the floor, walls, and ceiling - an extension of the natural
landscape to the artificial landscape. All the notions of objects as
singular are dispelled and are replaced by an environment rising out of the
ground. The continuous white field is surrounded by field of fluorescence to
allude to the world of technology, to digital space and arbiters, as a
recluse from infotrophy.

Inevitably our entire physical landscape will merge and connect. Furniture
and space merge, Object and environment, City and town, water and ground,
highway to highway, being to being.

Please come.


Sincerely, Karim Rashid
