Dear John,
There should be links on our website also to Vitra, Moroso and Fiam. They
will be able to give you details of distributors/stockists in your area.
Please contact me again if you are unable to find the info you need - we
would then need to know your location in the US.
kind regards,
Caroline Thorman
Ron Arad Associates

Dear Sir or Madam:

I just fell in love with Ron Arad's designs.  I have always been a fan, but
I just now went to your website.  Truly incredible.  I am a collector of
design objects and I am very interested in Ron Arad.  Are there any
distributors of his products in the US (other than Alessi and Kartell)?  I
am mainly interested in the mass produced  items and in particular the
furniture.

Thank you for your time and consideration and keep up the good work.

Sincerely,

John Harris Griffith
