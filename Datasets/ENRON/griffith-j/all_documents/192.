Hello John!!  HOw are you ?? How was your Holiday ?  Yes, there has been a 
tremendous ammount of talks about the Industrials asking for subsidies and 
help from the government to help lower the costs of gas...  They were asking 
for a fixed price of gas @ $3.00, or even $4.00, but the final decision was a 
loan to finance the cost of gas between IFERC and $4.00, to be paid over a 3 
to 4 year plan....I guess the final decision is not so harmful for us because 
we can still sell the derivatives, and it is a short term decision,,,What is 
really concerning me is all the noise behind it..The industrials are still 
pushing for a subsidy or a change in formula and the government is listening, 
so basically a lot of clients could eventually decide not to hedge in the 
meantime....Anyway, when do you have sometime to talk about chihuahua ? Let 
me know what is bets for you....Best regards.

Hey guys, 

Happy new year!! How are things going?  I just read an article in NGI about 
the Mexico Energy Ministry looking to possibly financing rising gas costs for 
the Mexico's industrial sector.  How does this affect Enron in Mexico?  Is 
this something that they have been talking about for sometime now?  This is 
tough on competition, right?

Have a great day and talk to you soon.  Thanks.

John
