Subject: Wellhead Group [Gas]


There has been several discussions this past week as to who does what re the 
wellhead book, so I decided to write this out for everyone to understand.

From now on, we will be going to the wellhead group in order to price out all 
of our wellhead supply.  Our main contact is John Grass.  John is the person 
whom we contact, and it is up to him to bring in someone from origination 
[Gary Bryan, Linda Roberts, Jill Zivley] or not, and he is the person who 
goes to the structuring group to get us our physical premium or discount.  
When it comes time to write up an excess contract or discuss/negotiate the 
excess pricing with the producer, our contact is John, and he will coordinate 
[with legal and origination] the discussions between ENA and the 
producer...of course, Tricia and I will be involved.
