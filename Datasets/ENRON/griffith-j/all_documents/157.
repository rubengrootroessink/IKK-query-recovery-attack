What up, my peoples?!?

After Thursday, Jan. 04, I will no longer be able to receive email at
this address. The Chronicle has opted to cancel my contract, so I will
not be working fulltime for them anymore. I will continue to work here
parttime in graphics, at night, however. Please forward all new email to
me at herrmannal@hotmail.com  starting immediately. Please note this is
a new address, not to be confused with the bad spamful
al_herrmann@hotmail.com (bad! don't send mail there!)  Thank you for
your attention to this matter.

On a much happier note, on Monday Jan. 1st I got a phone call from an
adoption registry I had signed up with on a lark about a month ago. They
found my biological mother, who had been looking for me, and gave me her
phone no., name, etc. We've left phone messages for each other, and I
expect to talk w/ her maybe tonight. Pretty freaky, huh? I am in shock.

xox,
Al Herrmann, Extraordinaire
