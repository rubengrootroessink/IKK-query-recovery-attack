Hey John & Angie, Have you heard the news from K-Girl?  Probably, but I'm
going to tell you anyway.  We're going to have a wedding July 28th.  K-Girl &
B-Boy will get married in Midland at Centennial Plaza(the most beautiful
water garden) in the AM.  We're pretty excited about the whole thing.
Keran's words to you are, you would make it very special if you
Angie(especially you Angie) & John(of course you John) could be there. It's
going to be a beautiful affair, no problems(everyoune must leave problems at
home or not come) that's the rules.  Southwest is running a special and I
would fly you two out for the day or for however long you wanted to stay.
Check your calendar and if you can it will be WONDERFUL but remember if you
can't we certainly understand and will just have to have another one in
Houston just for you two.
Love you so much!!!!
Mel
