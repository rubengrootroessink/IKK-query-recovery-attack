Dave,

To follow up on our conversation about the Pipe Option Book, Errol will 
provide post id's for Friday's COB
to calc the pipe options book with the skew table. As I asked on the phone 
please provide two calcs, one calc
for the pipe options deals with and with out skew and another calc with the 
NYMEX options deals with and without skew.

In addition to this, please recalc  1078960 & 1078963 for the ngpropt book.  
These calcs are for puts and for calls for COB 3-23.

If you have any questions please contact me at 3-9257 with any questions
