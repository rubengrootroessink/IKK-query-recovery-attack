Spoke with Joe Deffner concerning on the delivery points - he mentioned that 
we should assume the same four delivery points as in the prior Mahonia 
transaction:

1. Transcontintal Gas Pipeline, Zone 3 (Station 65)
2. Texas Gas Transmission, Zone SL
3. Columbia Gulf Transmission, Louisiana Onshore
4.Texas Eastern Transmission Company, Eastern Louisiana

Let me know - thanks again.

Mike

For now. Sandra and delapina will have to determine those at the time but 
assume them as placeholders for now.
