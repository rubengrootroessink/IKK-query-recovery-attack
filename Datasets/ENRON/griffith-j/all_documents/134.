you have wiring instructions?  Thanks.

Mary Lynne/John,

Just wanted to follow up on my earlier e-mail.  I re-ran my calculation for 
the Enron Cost of Funds/Deal Cost versus Libor.  The following reconciles 
this calculation:

 Difference between Libor and ENE Cost of Funds    $5,131,161
 Difference between ENE Cost of Funds and Deal Spread (87.5 bps)  $2,491,673

 Total Difference between Deal and Libor     $7,622,834

Sorry for the mistake and again, please let me know if there are any 
questions. Thanks.

Mike
