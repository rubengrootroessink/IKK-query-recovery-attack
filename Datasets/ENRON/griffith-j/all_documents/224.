Ina,

I just received the request this morning - I will send the request to ICE 
this morning and it is overnight processing for them before I receive the 
user ID and password.  I should be able to have that to him tomorrow.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Stephanie x33465

I have requested for John Griffith (request id# 13515) to have the I.C.E. 
program. Please have the process approved this morning.  He is ready to begin 
trading on our financial desk and needs this.

Thank You
Ina Rangel
