Helloo, my beautiful Houston kittens!!

Here's a link to some of the photos from my third-to-last night in Texas:

Thanks so much to those of you who made it out to our going-away party last
night. I'm sorry that not everybody could be there, but I understand and
hope you're feeling better. And thanks to everybody for your friendship and
support over the years. Anyway, I had a great time at the party, even when I
fell on my head while trying to do a keg stand. I wish I'd had more time to
spend with each of you. I feel honored to be able to call you my friends,
and I hope the distance between us won't change that. Please keep in touch
with me, let me know how you're doing, and come visit me in California.
We'll go to the beach, and hang out with movie stars together.

xoxoxox,
Al Herrmann
