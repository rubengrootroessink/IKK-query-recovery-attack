actually,  the hedges will be done at close - not pre-hedge by kcs [we have 
been working with credit, but they want something like $28 MM in escrow from 
kcs], so the hedges will be done at close in the name of ect merchant 
investments - then move to brazos.  last nite i called credit to confirm that 
ect merchant investments can do this big hedge - which i assume they can - it 
is enron.  but, i just wanted to cover all bases.

also, i have a question for you - when you guys get physical premium/discount 
numbers, do you go to the basis trader for this, or to an andy ring/susan 
perrira/kelly stevens/tom donohoe trader type? with peoples new roles, not 
sure who is doing what.   thanks.

joan
