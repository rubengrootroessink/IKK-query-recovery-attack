Dea John,
I didn't sell the Orgone chair,I was hoping for $750,but I
would negotiate.It costs $280 to send to you local airport,or more door to
door 3-4 days.I have a swivel base Gluon chair and ottoman in black leather
coming.That set is $4200 but won't be here for 12 weeks.I can order that for
you any time with wool or leather. I will also possibly be getting the
'Wicker' and 'Embryo' chair also.I can get them to order,but they are not
cheap.Also can get Newson dish-racks for $45.Let me know if you are
interested in anything,
Cheers John.
