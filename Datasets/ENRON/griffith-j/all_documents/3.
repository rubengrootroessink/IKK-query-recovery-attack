John,
Attached is the base curve we used to value the ACE (Ahlstrom plant in CA) as 
of Nov 10,2000.  

What I am looking for is this:

What would be the cost to buy the following four put options,
assuming financial settle 
 volume of 10,000 MMBtu/day ,
settled at Socal,
Option term of 2001-2002 :

Monthly Put option, strike price based on the curve in the attached 
spreadsheet (Nov 10 curve)
Same as above but strike is at the market.
Annual put option, strike price based on the curve in the attached 
spreadsheet (Nov 10 curve).
Annual put option but with strike at the market.

Last week I got bids from Phillips which were ($0.02) and ($0.03) for Socal 
basis for 2001 and 2002, respectively.  We will likely need to update these 
numbers.
