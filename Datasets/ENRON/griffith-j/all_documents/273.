John, 

Doug called me with a question regarding the Historical Henry Hub price: Are 
those monthly gas prices as of NYMEX contract expiration date?  For example, 
Jan. 2001 contracts expire on 12/31/2000.  He wants to make sure that the 
12/31/2000 gas price is actually for Jan. 2001 contracts.  Thanks!

Ying
