Marilyn,

In talking to Amber, she said that you could set-up entities that  are 
affiliated with Enron.  Enron is the GP of Brazos VVP Limited Partnership and 
we need to set-up as  a counter party on the system to assign some trades.   
It is my understanding that RAC (Credit) has approved Brazos.  Let me know if 
you have any questions. Thx  JGM
