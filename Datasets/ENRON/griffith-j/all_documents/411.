John,

The Id that I gave you is for EnronOnline website, if you already have a 
website Id not to worry, the one I issued you is a read only Id.  I show no 
record of an Id in your name, do you mind forwarding back to me the Id you 
are using and I will put into our records.

Thanks,

Kathy

I do not understand. I already have a password and login ID.  Has it changed?

Thanks.
