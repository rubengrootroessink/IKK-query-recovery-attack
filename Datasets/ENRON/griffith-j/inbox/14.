Mr. Griffith,
Hello my name is Garth Camp and I am a close friend of Jeb Ligums.  I wanted
to first thank you for the contact at Carr Futures, Mr. Heffner, I really
appreciate it.  At this point have have emailed Mr. Heffner a few times. I
know that he must be busy, however, I would like to know if he received my
emails, resume and cover letter.  I know you have been kind enough for the
connection, I was wondering if you could help me find out if Mr. Heffner did
receive them.  I wanted to thank you again for your time and your help.  If
I do need to resend information please email me at garthcamp@hotmail.com, or
call (860)582-2275.

Sincerely,

Garth Camp
