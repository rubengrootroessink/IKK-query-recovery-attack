can have a more suitable point of contact.

David,

from a Gas perspective, Iain Greig is running the show as far as I know.  If this is clearly an Estate issue (not too apparent from your e-mail), then we should let Iain field the issue initially.

regards

Steve

Steve,

	John Griffith, a financial trader has approached me asking for some support of some risk/trade worksheets that he had been receiving help
from Greg Couch on.  Franky Sulistio is currently working with John to learn these applications so that he can help, but John is really looking for
a more risk knowledgeable resources, one that can support him from front to back office.  Greg Couch was apparently developing a good bit of
stuff for him and risk.

Do you know who I could point him to for this support?

Thanks,

Dave
