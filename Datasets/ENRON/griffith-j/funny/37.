A woman in a hot  air balloon realized she was lost.  She lowered altitude and spotted a man  below.  She descended a bit more and shouted, "Excuse me, can you help  me?  I promised a friend I would meet him in an hour ago, but I don't know  where I am..."
The man consulted  his GPS and replied, "You're in a hot air balloon approximately 30 feet above a  ground elevation of 2,346 feet above sea level.  You are 31 degrees, 14.97  minutes north latitude, and 100 degrees, 49.09 minutes west  longitude."
"You must be a  Republican," said the balloonist.
"I am," replied  the man.  "How did you know?"
"Well, answered  the balloonist, "everything you told me is technically correct, but I still have  no idea what to make of your information, and the fact is I am still lost.   Frankly, you haven't been much help so far."
The man responded,  "You must be a Democrat."
"I am," replied  the balloonist, "but how did you know?"
"Well," said the  man, "you don't know where you are or where you are going, you have risen to  where you are due to a large quantity of hot air, you made a promise which you  have no idea how to keep, and you expect me to solve your problem...  The  fact is, you are in exactly the same position you were in before we met, but  now, somehow, it's my fault!"
