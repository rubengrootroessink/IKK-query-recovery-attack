WAIT TRAINING

Perhaps you can relate. One man was to meet his wife downtown and
spend some time shopping with her. He waited patiently for 15
minutes. Then he waited impatiently for 15 minutes more.

After that, he became angry. Seeing one of those photograph
booths nearby (the kind that accepts coins into a slot and takes
four shots while you pose on a small bench), he had an idea. He
assumed the most ferocious expression he could manage, which
wasn't difficult under the circumstances, and in a few moments he
was holding four small prints that shocked even him!

He wrote his wife's name on the back of the photographs and
handed them to a clerk behind the desk. "If you see a small, dark
lady with brown eyes and an apologetic expression, apparently
looking for someone, would you please give her this?" he said.

He then returned to his office content that, if a picture is
worth a thousand words, then four photos must be a full-blown
lecture!

His wife saved those pictures. She carries them in her purse now.
Shows them to anyone who asks if she is married..

How are you with patience? One person calls it "wait-training."
It seems that there is always something we are waiting for. We
wait on traffic and we wait in lines. We wait to hear about a new
job. We wait to complete school or to retire. We wait to grow up
or for maturity in a child. We wait for a decision to be made. We
wait for someone to change his or her mind.

Patience is an essential quality of a happy life. After all, some
things are worth waiting for. Every day presents plenty of
opportunities for wait training.

 We can resent waiting, accept it or even get good at it! But one
thing is certain - we cannot avoid it. How is your wait training
coming along?
