A businessman got on an  elevator in a building. When he entered the 
> elevator, there was a blonde already  inside and she greeted him by 
> reciting the letters,  "T-G-I-F." 
> 
>  He smiled at her and replied, "S-H-I-T." She looked at him, puzzled,  and 
> said  "T-G-I-F" again. 
> 
>  He acknowledged her remark again by answering, "S-H-I-T."  
> 
> The blonde was trying to be friendly,  so she smiled her biggest smile and 
> said, as sweetly as possible,  "T-G-I-F" another time. 
> 
>  The man smiled back to her and once again replied with a  quizzical 
>  expression, "S-H-I-T." 
> 
>  The blonde finally decided to explain things, and this time she  said, 
>  "T-G-I-F, Thank Goodness It's Friday, get it?" 
> 
> The man answered, "S-H-I-T: Sorry  Honey, It's Thursday."
