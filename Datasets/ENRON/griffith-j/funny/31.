Hello friends. I'm engaged in yet another bizarre art event. I hope 
to see you there. Details below >>>
00> Cockfight Arena <00
C-level, Chinatown Los Angeles
Saturday Nov. 10th
7pm - 11pm
The creators of Tekken Torture Tournament are proud to bring you 
Cockfight Arena. A one night parade of sweat and adrenaline pitting 
viewer against viewer in brutal virtual cockfighting theatre. After 
entering our dimly lit basement space, audience volunteers will don 
custom-made wireless game controllers with full sized wings and 
feathered helmets. Combatants will step into an arena to control 
their life size game avatars through vigorous flapping and pecking, 
competing for blood and birdfeed while rapaciously inflicting 
onscreen bodily harm.
:::
Cockfight Arena is free and open to the public. Gambling and smoking 
will be permitted. No animals or humans were injured in the 
production of this event.
:::
C-level is a cooperative public and private lab formed to share 
physical, social and technological resources. Its members are 
artists, programmers, writers, designers, agit-propers, filmmakers 
and reverse-engineers. Part studio, part club, part stage and part 
screen; C-Level is located in a basement in Chinatown Los Angeles and 
plays host to various events such as screenings, performances, 
lectures, debates, dances, readings and tournaments.
