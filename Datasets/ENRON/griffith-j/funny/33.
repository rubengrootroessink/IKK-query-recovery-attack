During the next 60 seconds, stop whatever you are  doing, and take this 
opportunity. (Literally it is only  1 minute) All you have to do is the 
following:  
You simply say an "Our Father" for the person that sent you  this message: 
Our Father who art in Heaven, Hallowed be Thy Name, Thy Kingdom  Come, Thy 
Will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven.  Give us this day our daily 
bread and forgive us our  trespasses as we forgive those who trespass 
against us,  and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil. For 
Thine is the Kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever,  Amen. 
Next, you send this message to everyone you know. In awhile,  more people 
will have prayed for you and you would have  obtained a lot of people 
praying for others. 
Next, stop and think and appreciate God's power in your life,  for doing 
what you know is pleasing to him. If you are  not ashamed to do this, 
follow the instructions. Jesus  said, "If you are ashamed of me, I will be 
ashamed of  you before My Father" 
If you are not ashamed, send this message...only if you believe.  "Yes, I 
love my God. He is my fountain of Life and My  Savior. He keeps me going day 
and night. Without Him, I  am no one. But with Him, I can do everything. 
Christ is  my strength." This is a simple test. If you love God and you are  
not ashamed of all the great things that He  has done for you, send this to 
everyone you know, and  the person who sent it to you. Thanks!!!
