John:

I need you to assist me in repricing Kern River.  We are sending a package to 
the customer on Monday and will need to reprice the gas swap before we do 
so.  

I am also attaching a spreadsheet, which includes delivery location and 
monthly MMBTUs.  I would really appreciate it if you send me the model as 
well because the monthly volumes will change with different scenarios.

Call me if you have any questions.

Thanks.

Maria
