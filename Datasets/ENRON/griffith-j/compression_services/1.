Hey John:

I need to get an updated notional price for Iroquois.  We are sending an 
updated  proposal to the customer next week so I will really appreciate it if 
you could send it to me as soon as you can.

Call me if you have any questions.

Maria Tefel

Ps.  Please also forward your model to me because I have to run several 
scenarios, in which the gas volumes vary.
Thanks!

Maria,

Here is the model.  Call with questions.  Once I again I want to remind you 
that these are still indicative.  Thanks.

John
