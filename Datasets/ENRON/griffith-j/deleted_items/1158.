Hey sugar, what is going on?  I love and miss you.  Today is the weekend.  Yippee.  I cant wait.  Enron stock is now below $5.  I think that that is not good, however, as long as our credit rating stays where it is, then we are okay.  We will see.

By the way sugar, Mike just asked me to play golf at 7:40 am friday morning.  Do you mind if I play?  It is not a big deal but I would like to spend some time with mike outside of work, especially in light of what is going on.  Just let me know.

Love you

The Pigs
