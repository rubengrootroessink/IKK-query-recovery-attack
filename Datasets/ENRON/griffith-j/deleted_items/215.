Here's the list of the Software Licenses Needed for NetCo showing the detail break out of the Total # Instances between User, Server, and Other.  

(A few sections still need the instances broken down by type and we'll include them as soon as they're available.)

For the Oracle database products we've included a separate tab with the specific details which apply there.
