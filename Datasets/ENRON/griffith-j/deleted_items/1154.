Good morning my sugar, how are you.  I love and miss you very much.  I had a wonderful weekend with you.  You are so special.  I love you.  

I am feeling a little better, probably because I got up and around.  I am still a little weak but I think I will be okay.  

Have a great day and I will talk to you later.

The Piggy
