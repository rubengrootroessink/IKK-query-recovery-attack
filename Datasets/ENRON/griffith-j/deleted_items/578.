Hey what is going on?  How did you sleep last nite.  I didn't sleep well.  I had weird dreams.  Anyway, I had a wonderful time yesterday.  I hope you did as well.  You have a very nice room.  Everything a person needs.  A nice soft bed, a tv, a closet, a computer and a nice soft bed, oh did I mention that already, I guess that is on my mind.  

Have a wonderful day and I will talk to you soon.

I might need a ride today, are you still okay with that?  I have to call the dealership when they open.  Thank you for offering.
