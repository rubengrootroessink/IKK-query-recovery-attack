What time can you get off?  I think I will work until about 5:45 is that okay?

Thank you so much for doing this.  I really appreciate it. 

Just to make sure you understand what you are doing for me, you are following me to my dealership and then giving me a ride home, my dealership is up by greenspoint mall, is that okay?
