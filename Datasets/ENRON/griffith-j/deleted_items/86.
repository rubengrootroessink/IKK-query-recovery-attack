This had most of the state of Michigan laughing for 2 days and a very
embarrassed female news anchor who will, in the future, likely think
before she speaks.

What happens when you predict snow but don't get any....

True story...we had a female news anchor who, the day after it was
supposed to have snowed and didn't, turned to the weatherman and asked
"So
Bob, where's that 8 inches you promised me last night?"

Not only did HE have to leave the set, but half the crew did too, they
were laughing so hard!
