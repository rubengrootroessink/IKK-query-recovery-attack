Hey sugar, what is going on?  I love and miss you.  Today is the
weekend.  Yippee.  I cant wait.  Enron stock is now below $5.  I think
that that is not good, however, as long as our credit rating stays where
it is, then we are okay.  We will see.
By the way sugar, Mike just asked me to play golf at 7:40 am friday
morning.  Do you mind if I play?  It is not a big deal but I would like
to spend some time with mike outside of work, especially in light of
what is going on.  Just let me know.
Love you
The Pigs
