Hey John,
 
Clearly having any job is better than  none, but I am curious how y'all are viewing the UBS acquisition.  If a  clear break from Enron can be achieved quickly, that would be a beautiful  thing.  However, it is hard to imagine that will be possible.   Thoughts?  I have been talking with Fairley, but I am curious if there was  anything that left a bad taste in your mouth from your meetings with him.   My resume has already been sent to most of the energy companies, but I have  received zip responses.  The Enron Effect has really confused the  market.  I have not lost hope, but if I do not start seeing some movement  by the end of February I will begin to worry.  I still hope to stay in  energy and to stay in Houston, but if February proves to be a dead month, I will  start considering relocating.  What a friggin' mess.  Where are y'all  going to be located?
 
Hopefully, you have been able to put  some of this behind you and enjoy the forced "slow time".  I played golf  last week, but I had to use someone's clubs and it completely screwed me (I  wouldn't even consider what I was doing "golf").  Oh well, back to the  range.
 
Keep in touch,
Mathew
