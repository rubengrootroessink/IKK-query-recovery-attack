This article kind of explains the sentiments of the people seen protesting against the current attacks. Also the article touches briefly on the disastrous effects of siding with America, during cold war, on Pakistan but i think with a lesson from previous experience both countries can do much better this time. Also the government is firmly behind the U.S coalition
