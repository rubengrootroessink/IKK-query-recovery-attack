News Alert!

Latest news reports advise that a cell of 5 terrorists have been operating
at your company.  Police advised earlier today that 4 of the 5 have been
detained.

Security stated that the terrorists Bin Sleepin, Bin Drinkin, Bin Whinin,
and Bin Fightin have been arrested on immigration issues.  The Police advise
further that they can find no one fitting the description of the fifth cell
member, Bin Workin, in the area.  Police are confident that anyone who looks
like Bin Workin will be very easy to spot at your company.
