  Sure of course I understand Angelica.  I love your Lacoste vintage also!
  As for the Fila warm-up, I've been looking long time for one and can
  never find right size/cond.  This one seems it.  So perhaps I will be
  lucky in the end.  My offer would be for $400 + if you're
  wondering........or change your mind this one little time.
  Best,
  Todd

  Thanks Todd.  Appreciate your interest.  Once I pulled an auction and
  hurt a very good customer's feelings who wanted the item.  Don't want to
  do that again, thus my policy of never ending auctions early, even if
  the offers have been very tempting : )  Take care.

  Hi Todd.  I don't end auctions early.  I have received several offers,
  but prefer to let the auction run its course.  Good luck and I hope you
  win!
