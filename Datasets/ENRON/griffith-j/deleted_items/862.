I hope that you foot is okay.  You need to be careful.  I liked the shoes though.  It is too bad you can't wear heels.  You look really good in them.  I guess no more hoochi wear for right now huh?

wearing those heels yesterday was a bad idea.   they were killing me all night.  i had to take them off.   and then when i woke up this morning my ankle was swollen and bruised.  went to the dr earlier and she said i most likely injured a tendon or ligament.    great.  no heels for a while.
