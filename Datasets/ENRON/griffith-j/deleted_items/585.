Hi sweetie!   sorry to hear you didnt sleep well.   i on the other hand slept great!   i would've slept even better with a certain someone at my side.  all  in due time i guess.   
thanks for complimenting my room - but as i said "it serves its purpose".   i bet it is not as nice as your home.  
hey sorry about thunder's hair getting on you.   i think he is shedding.  last night i took him with me to pick something up from my sister's house and his hair was all over my shirt.  i took him a good long bath last night.  he is squeaky clean.   

i'm still ok with giving you a ride today.

Hey what is going on?  How did you sleep last nite.  I didn't sleep well.  I had weird dreams.  Anyway, I had a wonderful time yesterday.  I hope you did as well.  You have a very nice room.  Everything a person needs.  A nice soft bed, a tv, a closet, a computer and a nice soft bed, oh did I mention that already, I guess that is on my mind.  

Have a wonderful day and I will talk to you soon.

I might need a ride today, are you still okay with that?  I have to call the dealership when they open.  Thank you for offering.
