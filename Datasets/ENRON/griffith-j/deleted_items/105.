The Will to Persevere (Abraham Lincoln) 2.012

Next time you want to quit, remember this chronology from the life of one of
America's greatest Presidents, Abraham Lincoln:

In 1831, he failed in business.
One year later, he was defeated for state legislator.
In 1833, he tried again in business. And failed again.
In 1835, his fianc?e died.
In 1836, he had a nervous breakdown.

In 1843, Lincoln ran for congress and was defeated.
In 1848, he tried again, and lost again.
In 1855, he ran for the Senate, and lost.
One year later, he ran for Vice President, and lost.
In 1859, he ran again for the Senate, and was defeated.

And in 1860, he was elected President of the United States.

"The difference between history's boldest accomplishments, and its most
staggering failures is often, simply, the diligent will to persevere."
