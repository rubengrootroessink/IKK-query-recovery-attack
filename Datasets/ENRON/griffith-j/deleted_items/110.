Hey John,

Yes and there's a Design Council event with him Tuesday night and a
reception at Sunset Settings on Thursday.  Will we see you at any or all of
the above?

Chris

Hey Chris,

What is going on?  Are you going to go see the Marcel Wanders lecture at
the museum on Wednesday?  Just checking to see what is happening.  Hope all
is well.  Talk to you soon.

John
