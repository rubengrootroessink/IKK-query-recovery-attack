Do you have time?  I have to call to see if it is ready.  I thank you for the offer.  I might take you up on it.

Did you listen to the CD?  Did you like it?  I saw them in concert in 92 at Fitzgeralds.  I stayed after the show and talked to them.  I was a big fan at the time.  I also saw them a couple of times at Numbers.  Have you ever been to Numbers?

i miss you more and more each day.  have to leave at 3 to go and look at an apt that i saw in montrose area.  small apt complex.  we'll see how that turns out.

i dont think my band is playing this friday after all.  i think one of our members was not going to be in town so i think they booked someone else.

 Hey what is going on over there?  You look wonderful today (as usual).  Are you having a good day?  Thanks for the ride yesterday.  I know it was out of your way.  I enjoyed riding and talking to you.  I hope you did the same.
