You may have received an e-mail from out PEP system asking you to provide feedback on certain employees. Please disregard. This was sent in error and it is not necessary at this time to complete the evaluations. These employees are on vacation and entered their reviewers into the system before they left.  Since then the business has decided to postpone the evaluation process and the opening of PEP. Please feel free to call me if you have any questions. Thanks!
