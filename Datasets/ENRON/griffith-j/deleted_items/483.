your books are in my car.   

geez, now you want to beat me?    meanie.

i wish you'd come over my house.   we need to go to spend time at someones house.

i have a couple of questions for you:     1)   are you the jealous type?             2)  If you were single, do you think that you would be interested in dating someone like me?
