Sorry it has taken me so long to respond, I don't think I will have a chance to have drinks with you.  I have to work a little late then I will have to go home.  I am sorry.  I sure do wish I could join you.  What are you doing tonite?  what are your plans for the weekend?  I hope to see you this weekend.  I will call you and let you know.  

Did you talk to your cousin shelly about the new apt?  Have you decided what you are going to do?  I hope everything works out.  

It has been a very busy day.  I am beat.  I think when I get home I will collapse.  I need a body massage.  Do you know anyone that could give me a good body massage?  I need someone with a strong but gentle touch.  What do you think?  I think I would probably return the favor as well.

What time are you leaving today?
