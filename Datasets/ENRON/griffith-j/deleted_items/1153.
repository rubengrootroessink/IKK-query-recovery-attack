I am sorry, I did get your message the next day, Angie was on the computer and she got off for me to call you, then she got back on, that is our only line, she is on the computer most of the time working, I am sorry I didn't call you, I do love and miss you as well, I do have some issues but they do not involve you or the family, just some work mainly also some others as well, I am sorry I didn't talk earlier, just real busy today, I will call you around noon when things slow down.  Please forgive me.

I am sorry about the kids not knowing their uncle as well.  I will have to change that.

Please forgive me and give me another chance I will not screw things up.

Love you very much

J-Boy

Subject:	hey you called....

You called me the other night.....on my mobile and at home....you also left
a message that you would
call back sometime this weekend...I called your house not 1 minute after you
called my mobile...you wouldn't answer....
I also left messages several times after that....If that is the best you can
do...then I don't need it....
Someone has to stand up and say that's not good enough!!!!!    Family
doesn't treat family that way!!!!!
Enough is enough!!!!!!!!!       My kids don't even know who Uncle  Johnny
Boy is any more...and that is a shame!!!!
I love you more than a real brother and I am truly sorry if this hurts your
feelings...hell, you might decide to even not talk to me any more....but it
sorta seems like you alraedy decided that...so I don't have anything to lose
by sending this...
I still love you whether you want to love me back or not.....Mike
