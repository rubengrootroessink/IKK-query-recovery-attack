I am but I have been very busy over here just as you are as well.  I guess the way that things usually happen is that unless the originator pushes something to happen, I don't worry about it very much.  Maybe not the best way to handle, but my work schedule is usually swamped from 6:30 am till about 4:00 pm.  I do want to get together but I will have to let you know if today is good.  The AGA comes out today, could be a busy afternoon.  Sorry about this.  Please do not think I am blowing you off.  I will call you later. 

What is your number?

Thanks for your patience.

Hey John,

Any comments on what I sent you yesterday? Are you still interested in getting together and discussing results? If so, let me know and I'll be available.

regards,
