John,
Well i am glad that you are still with the firm. I know how you feel cause i
have friends at Enron who tell me the same thing. Infact my brother works
for UBS Warburg in London and he does not know whats going on also.

I am working with a few recruiters but have not received good leads from
them. Actually I never thanked Andy Zipper for referring me to MRE so i
would appreciate if you could let him know how much that helped me out.

Hope things turn out for the best for you!
Bilal
