Hey sexy what is going on?  I am sitting here at work thinking about you.  How has you day gone?  Did you think about me?  I have been thinking about you all day.  How I wish I was there with you.  I am glad you are moving out.  I think it will be really good for you.  To have the freedom that you need.  I am jealous.  I hope to be able to spend some time over at you new place.  

I just want you to know that you are very special to me and I really enjoy our time together even if it is short.  I enjoy talking to you and emailing you.  Of course I enjoy the other stuff but your company is what is very special.  Thanks for being there when I need someone to talk to or to hug or whatever.

Well, I guess I will get back to work.  See you soon.

John
