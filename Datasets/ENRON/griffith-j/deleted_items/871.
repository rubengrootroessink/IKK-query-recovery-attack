I will try to drive.  Probably not tomorrow, but maybe Wednesday or Thursday.  

Could we meet?  I wish I could pick you up, but that would take long.

What time will your cousin bring you to work this week?  I would really like to meet sometime, whether it be in my car or just at work early.

I asked you first.  Are you going to be without your car all week?  That is a bummer.
