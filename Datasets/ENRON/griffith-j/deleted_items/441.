Hey J-Boy, Just wanted you to know I made it home OK.  Keran was doing wonderful and I knew she & Brennen were ready for time to themselves.  I can't tell you how much I enjoyed our visits.  Tell Angie I missed seeing her and next time I want to visit with her too.  Thank you for your concern for Keran, You were there for me when I needed you. 
Mel
