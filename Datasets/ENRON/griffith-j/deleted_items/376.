>IMPORTANT NOTICE:
>Police warn all male clubbers, party goers and unsuspecting pub regulars to
>be more alert and cautious when accepting a drink offer from a woman. There
>is a date rape drug going around called "beer" and it appears in liquid
>form.
>The drug is being used by female sexual predators at parties to persuade
>male victims to have sex with them.
>"Beer" is available virtually everywhere. All a woman has to do is
>persuade a man to consume a few units of "beer" and then simply ask him
>home
>for "no-strings-attached" sex. Men are rendered helpless against such
>attacks. After several "beers", men will often succumb to performing sexual
>acts on horrific looking women who they would never normally be attracted
>to.
>Men often wake up after having "beer" with only hazy memories of what
>happened to them the night before... just a vague feeling that something
>bad
>occurred.
>At other times these unfortunate men might be conned into a familiar scam
>known as a "relationship".... apparently men are easier victims for this
>scam
>after the "beer" has been administered and they have already been sexually
>attacked.
>FORWARD THIS ALERT TO EVERY MALE YOU KNOW!
>However, if you fall victim to this insidious drug and the predatory women
>who administer it, there are male support groups where you can discuss the
>details of your shocking encounter in an open manner with other males
>victims. For your nearest support group, look up "Taverns" in the Yellow
>Pages.
