Hey sugar , how are you doing?  I will probably work a little late just to make sure everything works out right.  Call me when you get a chance.  I love and miss you.

Also, check out this auction on ebay, it is this number  1476553389 .  I didn't know but Verner Panton designed a chair for Ikea.  Weird huh.

Love you
