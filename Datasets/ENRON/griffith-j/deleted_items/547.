Hey sugar, how are you doing?  Did you sleep okay?  I had weird dreams,
I think because I ate then went straight to bed.  I am a puffy frog
today.  Need to be popped.
I forgot about the option class that John is giving today @ 2pm, I don't
know how long it will last, but I do want to join them.  I will probably
learn something.
I hope you have a wonderful day, tell the crazies hi.  
Talk to you later my sugar, IT IS THE WEEKEND, YEAH.  I get to spend
time with my baby.  Love you very much.
