Sure of course I understand Angelica.  I love your Lacoste vintage also!  As for the Fila warm-up, I've been looking long time for one and can never find right size/cond.  This one seems it.  So perhaps I will be lucky in the end.  My offer would be for $400 + if you're wondering........or change your mind this one little time.
Best,
Todd

Thanks Todd.  Appreciate your interest.  Once I pulled an auction and hurt a very good customer's feelings who wanted the item.  Don't want to do that again, thus my policy of never ending auctions early, even if the offers have been very tempting : )  Take care.

Hi Todd.  I don't end auctions early.  I have received several offers, but prefer to let the auction run its course.  Good luck and I hope you win!
