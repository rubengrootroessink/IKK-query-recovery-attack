Yes I think my position would still be maintained if the trade group is acq=
uired, however, I don't know if that is a definite thing.  I have heard tha=
t one company that is bidding on us (I don't know which one) would want to =
cut 250 more people.  Who knows who those people will be.  I just keep thin=
king about the retention bonuses and I was not one of the lucky recipients,=
 so what keeps a company from coming in and keeping only the people that we=
re deemed important in the first go round.  Also, if I find another oppurtu=
nity what would make me stay here when I get overlooked in the area of impo=
rtance (retention bonuses).  I want to work with John Arnold and Mike Maggi=
 as long as I can because I think I could learn alot more from them, but I =
do not want to work for people that don't see my importance, does that make=
 since?  I am not trying to treat this like grade school or anything, but I=
 think I add alot to the group and I know that there are places that would =
see that and reward me for that.  Anyway, I am here for now. =20

I think I told you but maybe not, I have an offer from Tractebel.  It is a =
good offer but not a great one.  I have to think about it.  Have you talked=
 to them?  Have you talked to Fairley?  If not, you need to, they are beefi=
ng up.  Also, RWE, have you talked to them?  You need to talk to them as we=
ll.  Let me know if I can help in any way.

I would love to play golf with you anytime.  Just let me know, I can leave =
here pretty much whenever I want.  Also have a wonderful time in Florida, h=
ave a few drinks for me, make a few double bogeys for me and chase a few wo=
men for me.  Call me anytime, my home number is (713) 527-8743 and work is =
(713) 853-6247.

Good Luck and I look forward to talking to you.

John

Johnny,

What do you mean you are there "for the  time being"?  Wouldn't your positi=
on be maintained when the trading group  is acquired?  I would think that a=
s long as J Arnold has a say you would be  included.  Am I incorrect?  Thin=
gs in Unemployment Land are pretty  surreal.  When I stop and think about t=
he hours that I put in only to be  laid off...go figure.  However, I try no=
t to dwell in areas where I had no  control.  I have been flooding my resum=
e throughout the Houston-based  energy companies to no avail.  There is no =
telling when the "Enron Effect"  will wear off on the capital markets, so I=
 might have to consider a different  industry (know of any good antique sho=
ps that need a full time  cashier?)
=20
I tried to enjoy the holidays, but I  constantly kept an eye on my inbox an=
d carried my cell phone everywhere just in  case.  As you can imagine, not =
completely relaxing.  The good news is  that I am going to Florida Sunday t=
o visit a friend, run on the beach, drink  heavily and hopefully play golf.=
  Have you been able to play?  When  all of this gets resolved, you and I d=
efinitely need to hit the links (as long  as you don't mind me wandering th=
rough the woods most of the time).
=20
Please keep me posted on your plans and  I look forward to getting together=
 sometime soon.
