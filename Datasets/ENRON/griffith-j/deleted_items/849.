Hey sugar, good morning how are you doing?  Thanks for the ride into work.  I love and miss you very much.  I can't wait until this next weekend.  I found the car charger and it fits the phone, so we are set to keep the phone in the car.  That will be good for you.  I worry about you when you are alone.  Have a wonderful day and I will talk to you later.  Don't work too hard.  

Love you
