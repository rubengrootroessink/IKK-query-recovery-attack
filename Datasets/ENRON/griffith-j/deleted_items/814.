Thank you, I will think of what I am working on and let you know.

Give me a few days to think about and I will get with you.  

Again thanks for the offer.

John

John,

Since you seem to be swamped in things that need to be done and I have a strong interest in options trading, I would like to offer any time that I have outside my Gas Structuring obligations to help you with anything that might help make your job easier. I realize some of the tasks may be somewhat mundane but hopefully I will also get a good understanding of how you do your job.

Regards,

cjc
