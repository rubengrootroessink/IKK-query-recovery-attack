Hi John,
Hope you had great holidays. I just wanted to update you on my progress. I
returned on Jan 6th after taking some time off from job search and have been
in active discussion with MRE Consulting and Dynegy. Although I have not
received an offer from either I am hopeful.

At Caminus I emailed Debbie and unfortunately I could not set up a time to
meet her before New Years. She has been on vacation since then and i am
looking forward to meeting her when she gets back. I think after Caminus I
would feel comfortable making a decision.

Do you have any suggestions/thoughts? Once again thanks a lot for looking
out for me!
Bilal
