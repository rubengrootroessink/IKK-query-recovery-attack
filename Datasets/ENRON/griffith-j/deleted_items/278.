Hi Pigs.  You can if you want.  How about sandwiches from the ham place on West gray?  Both of my parents like ham, american cheese, mayo, lettuce, tomatoe, and ONIONS!  What do you think of getting lunch there?  Love you!

Hey sugar, do you want me to bring some lunch home with me for you and the crazies?  I love you.
