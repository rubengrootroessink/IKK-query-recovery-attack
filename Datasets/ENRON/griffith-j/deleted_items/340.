Johnny,
 
What do you mean you are there "for the  time being"?  Wouldn't your position be maintained when the trading group  is acquired?  I would think that as long as J Arnold has a say you would be  included.  Am I incorrect?  Things in Unemployment Land are pretty  surreal.  When I stop and think about the hours that I put in only to be  laid off...go figure.  However, I try not to dwell in areas where I had no  control.  I have been flooding my resume throughout the Houston-based  energy companies to no avail.  There is no telling when the "Enron Effect"  will wear off on the capital markets, so I might have to consider a different  industry (know of any good antique shops that need a full time  cashier?)
 
I tried to enjoy the holidays, but I  constantly kept an eye on my inbox and carried my cell phone everywhere just in  case.  As you can imagine, not completely relaxing.  The good news is  that I am going to Florida Sunday to visit a friend, run on the beach, drink  heavily and hopefully play golf.  Have you been able to play?  When  all of this gets resolved, you and I definitely need to hit the links (as long  as you don't mind me wandering through the woods most of the time).
 
Please keep me posted on your plans and  I look forward to getting together sometime soon.
 
Mathew
