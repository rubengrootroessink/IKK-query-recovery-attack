Hey sugar, what is going on?  I love and miss you.  Nothing happening here just yet.  John and Mike are out until 1 or 1:30, hopefully I will find something out then.  I bet that I won't find anything out for a couple of days though.  Anyway, have a great day.  Talk to you soon.  

Love you

The Pigs
