Hey sugar, I have a meeting from 4 to 5 with my group.  I think we are going to discuss all the things going on here.  I will call when I get out.  I deposited the money.  We have $316.  I put in $240 so that means that nothing has gone through since we deposited the money on Sat.  I kept out $13 just in case.  I love you and I will call you when I get out of my meeting.
