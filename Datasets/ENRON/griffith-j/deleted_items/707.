I think your friend puts you in a funky mood doesn't it?

I feel good as well when you smile at me.  There are alot of duplexes in the montrose area, I know you will find something.

good morning.    i know this sounds corny, but as soon as you said good morning and smiled at me - i felt 10 times better!  you always brighten my day.  i mean it.
i am doing ok this morning.  
i went to see the apt and i didnot like it.  too small.    but i saw a few others that i  want to take a look at today.    
i did not get to speak to shelly last night.   i got home about 8:30 pm.  i just went driving around montrose and i found some duplexes and fourplex apts.  
then i had dinner late with my cousin and my friend mike and came home and went to bed.    i have just been in this funky mood - dont know why...

Good morning, you look very nice today.  How are you doing?  How was the apt?  Any problems at home because of Shelly?

Anyway have a great day.  I really love seeing you each day.  Thanks for the ride yesterday.  I really appreciate it.

Talk to you soon.
