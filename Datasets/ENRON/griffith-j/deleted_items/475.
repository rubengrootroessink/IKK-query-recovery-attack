Good morning,

How are you doing?  I enjoyed our ride in this morning.  I wish it could have been longer, sorry it wasn't.  I so wished it could have been longer, you look so good today.  Let me know what your plans are this evening, maybe I will have some time to spend with you.  I will let you know just as soon as I know.  It is really up in the air right now.  I don't want you to cancel anything.  Hope you have a wonderful day.  

I think I am in a still in a daze from this morning, I can't imagine how I would feel if we would have stayed longer, probably very calm and wonderful.  I still feel wonderful, but something seems to be missing, anyway, better work.

Talk to you soon, my sexy thing.
