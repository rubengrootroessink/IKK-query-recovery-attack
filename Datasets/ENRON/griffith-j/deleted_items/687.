John,
 
We haven't had the chance to talk the last 2-3 days (only briefly today), so I just wanted you to know I haven't forgotten about you and I am doing what I can to get your stuff finished alongside my other to-do items.  
 
As we discussed this evening, I know I still owe you your desired modifications to the input screens.  I believe we are functionally there, you just want some "look and feel" modifications.  Let me know if this you think of something different.
 
Also, if you begin using the valuation model again tomorrow morning, let me know how it goes (accuracy, morning macro, etc).  I really want this in production and I want it to be successful for you.
 
Hopefully things go well with the mods I've done to the valuation stuff.
 
Greg
