=09=09=09 [IMAGE] 1/31/02 John 5:30-47  [IMAGE] [IMAGE] "I can do nothing o=
n my own authority; as I hear, I judge;  and my judgment is just, because I=
 seek not my own will but the will  of him who sent me. If I bear witness t=
o myself, my testimony is not  true; there is another who bears witness to =
me, and I know that the  testimony which he bears to me is true.   "You sen=
t to John,  and he has borne witness to the truth. Not that the testimony w=
hich  I receive is from man; but I say this that you may be saved. He was  =
a burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a  while in=
 his light. But the testimony which I have is greater than  that of John; f=
or the works which the Father has granted me to  accomplish, these very wor=
ks which I am doing, bear me witness that  the Father has sent me.  "And th=
e Father who sent me has  himself borne witness to me. His voice you have n=
ever heard, his  form you have never seen; and you do not have his word abi=
ding in  you, for you do not believe him whom he has sent. You search the  =
scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life;  and it i=
s they that bear witness to me; yet you refuse to come to me  that you may =
have life.  "I do not receive glory from men. But  I know that you have not=
 the love of God within you. I have come in  my Father's name, and you do n=
ot receive me; if another comes in his  own name, him you will receive. How=
 can you believe, who receive  glory from one another and do not seek the g=
lory that comes from the  only God?   "Do not think that I shall accuse you=
 to the  Father; it is Moses who accuses you, on whom you set your hope. If=
  you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote of me. But if  you=
 do not believe his writings, how will you believe my  words?"  From the Re=
