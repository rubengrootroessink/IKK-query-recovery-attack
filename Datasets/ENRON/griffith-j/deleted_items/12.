Hey sugar, how are you doing?  I think I will be able to get home around 1-1:30.  Is that okay?  

Also, there are a few UBS people flying in tonite that I have been asked to go to dinner with them.  It should be an early dinner, probably around 6:30.  Is that okay?  Mike, Dutch and I have been asked to go to dinner with them.

Call me when you get a chance.  Love and miss you very much.
