   I am sorry, I did get your message the next day, Angie was on the
   computer
   and she got off for me to call you, then she got back on, that is our
   only
   line, she is on the computer most of the time working, I am sorry I
   didn't
   call you, I do love and miss you as well, I do have some issues but they
   do
   not involve you or the family, just some work mainly also some others as
   well, I am sorry I didn't talk earlier, just real busy today, I will
   call
   you around noon when things slow down.  Please forgive me.

   I am sorry about the kids not knowing their uncle as well.  I will have
   to
   change that.

   Please forgive me and give me another chance I will not screw things up.

   Love you very much

   J-Boy

      You called me the other night.....on my mobile and at home....you
   also
      left
      a message that you would
      call back sometime this weekend...I called your house not 1 minute
   after
      you
      called my mobile...you wouldn't answer....
      I also left messages several times after that....If that is the best
   you
      can
      do...then I don't need it....
      Someone has to stand up and say that's not good enough!!!!!    Family
      doesn't treat family that way!!!!!
      Enough is enough!!!!!!!!!       My kids don't even know who Uncle
      Johnny
      Boy is any more...and that is a shame!!!!
      I love you more than a real brother and I am truly sorry if this
   hurts
      your
      feelings...hell, you might decide to even not talk to me any
   more....but
      it
      sorta seems like you alraedy decided that...so I don't have anything
   to
      lose
      by sending this...
      I still love you whether you want to love me back or not.....Mike
