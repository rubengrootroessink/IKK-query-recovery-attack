Oh by the way, I am going to take my car in on Monday, so maybe you can give me a ride on Monday.  I will let you know, thanks for the offer.  I do not know what I am doing this evening yet.  Probably not have time to do anything, I thought I would.  I am sorry.   I would like to meet for breakfast though.  Hope you have time.  

I miss you today.
