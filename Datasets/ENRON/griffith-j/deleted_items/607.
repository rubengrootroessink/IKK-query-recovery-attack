i miss you more and more each day.  have to leave at 3 to go and look at an apt that i saw in montrose area.  small apt complex.  we'll see how that turns out.

i dont think my band is playing this friday after all.  i think one of our members was not going to be in town so i think they booked someone else.

 Hey what is going on over there?  You look wonderful today (as usual).  Are you having a good day?  Thanks for the ride yesterday.  I know it was out of your way.  I enjoyed riding and talking to you.  I hope you did the same.
