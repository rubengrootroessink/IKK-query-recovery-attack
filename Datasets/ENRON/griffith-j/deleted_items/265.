I will be home probably between 3 and 4 and yes I will make you some copies.  Do you need green ones as well?

Love You

Hi my little piggy.  Don't be sad, ok?  Everything is going to be great,
really.

Is it possible to make me more pink forms?  Are you out of pink paper?  It
can wait until tomorrow.  Just let me know.

What time do you think you will be home?  Love YOU!
