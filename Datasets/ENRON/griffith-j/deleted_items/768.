Since the Pledge of  Allegiance and The Lord's Prayer are not allowed in
most public schools  anymore because the word "God" is mentioned....a kid in
Arizona wrote the  attached NEW School prayer.  I liked it....
	Now I sit me down  in school
	Where praying is against the rule
	For this great nation under  God
	Finds mention of Him very odd.
	If Scripture now the class recites,
	It violates the Bill of Rights.
	and anytime my head I bow
	Becomes a Federal matter now.

	Our hair can be purple, orange or  green,
	That's no offense; it's a freedom scene.
	The law is specific, the law is precise.
	Prayers spoken aloud are a serious vice.

	For praying in a public hall
	Might offend someone with no faith at all.
	In silence alone we must meditate,
	God's name is prohibited by the state.

	We're allowed to cuss and dress like freaks,
	And pierce our noses, tongues and cheeks.
	They've outlawed guns, but FIRST the Bible.
	To quote the Good Book makes me liable.

	We can elect a pregnant Senior Queen,
	And the 'unwed daddy,' our Senior King.
	It's "inappropriate" to teach right from wrong,
	We're taught that such "judgments" do not belong.

	We can get our condoms and birth controls,
	Study witchcraft, vampires and totem poles.
	But the Ten Commandments are not allowed,
	No word of God must reach this  crowd.

	It's scary here I must confess,
	When chaos reigns the school's  a mess.
	So, Lord, this silent plea I make:
	Should I be shot; My soul please take!
	Amen
If you aren't ashamed to do this, please pass this on.  Jesus said, " If you
are ashamed of me," I will be ashamed of you  before my Father."
Not ashamed. Passing this on.
