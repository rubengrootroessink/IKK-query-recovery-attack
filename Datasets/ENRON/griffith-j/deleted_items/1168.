Good morning my sugar, how are you.  I love and miss you very much.  I
had a wonderful weekend with you.  You are so special.  I love you.  
I am feeling a little better, probably because I got up and around.  I
am still a little weak but I think I will be okay.  
Have a great day and I will talk to you later.
The Piggy
