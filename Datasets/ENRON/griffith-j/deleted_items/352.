Read this & Send it back to me please  
A philosophy professor stood before his class and had some items  in front of 
him. When class began, wordlessly he picked up a large  empty mayonnaise jar 
and proceeded to fill it with rocks right to the  top, rocks about 2" 
diameter. 
He then asked the students if  the jar was full? They agreed that it was.  So 
the professor then  picked up a box of pebbles and poured them in to the jar. 
He shook the  jar lightly. The pebbles, of course, rolled into the open areas  
between the rocks.  The students laughed. He asked his students  again if the 
jar was full? They agreed that yes, it was. 
The  professor then picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar. Of  
course, the sand filled up everything else. "Now," said the professor,  "I 
want you to recognize that this is your life. 
The rocks are  the important things - your family, your partner, your health, 
your  children - anything that is so important to you that if it were lost,  
you would be nearly destroyed. 
The pebbles are the other  things in life that matter, but on smaller scale. 
The pebbles  represent things like your job, your house, your car. 
The sand is  everything else. The small stuff. 
If you put the sand or the  pebbles into the jar first, there is no room for 
the rocks. The same  goes for your life. If you spend all your energy and time 
on the small  stuff, material things, you will never have room for the things 
that  are truly most important.  Pay attention to the things that are  critical 
in your life.  Play with your children. Take your  partner out dancing. There 
will always be time to go to work, clean  the house, give a dinner party and 
fix the disposal. "Take care of the  rocks first-the things that really 
matter. Set your priorities. The  rest is just pebbles and sand * Good Luck! 
I hope it works. 
*  May there always be work for your hands to do; 
* May your purse always  hold a coin or two; 
* May the sun always shine on your window pane;  
* May a rainbow be certain to follow each rain; 
* May the hand of  a friend always be near you; 
* May God fill your heart with gladness  to cheer you. 
* An Irish Blessing  * The Friendship Bracelet  
* O~xxxxxxx@@@@@xxxxxxx~O">O~xxxxxxx@@@@@xxxxxxx~O  
* OK, this is what you have to do...Send this to ALL of  your friends!  But
