And God populated the earth with broccoli  and cauliflower and spinach, 
 green and yellow vegetables of all  kinds, so Man and Woman would live 
 long and healthy lives.  
 
 And Satan created McDonald's. And  McDonald's brought forth the 
 99-cent double-cheeseburger. And  Satan said to Man, "You want fries 
 with that?" And Man said, "Super  size them." And Man gained pounds. 
 
 And God created the healthful  yogurt, that woman might keep her figure 
 that man found so fair.  
 
 And Satan froze the yogurt, and he  brought forth chocolate, nuts and 
 brightly colored sprinkle candy to  put on the yogurt. And woman 
 gained pounds. 
 
 And God said, "Try my crispy fresh  salad." 
 
 And Satan brought forth creamy  dressings, bacon bits, and shredded 
cheese. And there was ice cream for  dessert. And woman gained 
 pounds. 
 
And God said, "I have sent your heart  healthy vegetables and olive oil 
with which to cook them." 
 
 And Satan brought forth  chicken-fried steak so big it needed its own 
 platter. And Man gained pounds, and  his bad cholesterol went 
through the roof. 
 
 And God brought forth running  shoes, and Man resolved to lose those 
 extra pounds. 
 
 And Satan brought forth cable TV  with remote control so Man would not 
 have to toil to change channels  between ESPN and ESPN2. And Man 
 gained pounds. 
 
 And God said, "You're running up  the score, Devil." 
 
 And God brought forth the potato, a  vegetable naturally low in fat and 
 brimming with nutrition.  
 
 And Satan peeled off the healthful  skin and sliced the starchy center 
 into chips and deep-fat fried them.  And he created sour cream dip 
 also. And Man clutched his remote  control and ate the potato chips 
 swaddled in cholesterol. And Satan  saw and said, "It is good." And 
 Man went into cardiac arrest.  
 
 And God sighed and created  quadruple bypass surgery..... 
 
And Satan created  HMOs...
