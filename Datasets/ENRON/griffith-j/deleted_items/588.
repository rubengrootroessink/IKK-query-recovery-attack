You do not have to apologize to me.  I understand completely.  It is stress=
ful for me as well.  I hope your little friend doesn't bother you too much.

By the way, if you don't feel like picking me up at the dealership I unders=
tand.  It is a fairly long drive for you.  Just let me know.  Thanks.

i dont know why, but at first it felt a little awkward yesterday when we we=
re going into my house.  it felt as though i was sneaking a boy into my roo=
m.  i hope i didnt make you feel uncomfortable.  i was so happy that you ca=
me by and that i was able to see you and hold you comfortably at last.  i g=
uess i didnt really know how to react b/c my roommates were home.  dont get=
 me wrong.  they are really awesome people.  they dont care who comes over.=
  i think it has been quite a while since i brought "male"company over thou=
gh.  they probably would have been excited for me.  i think it was just me =
who was feeling strange.  i am really really close to my cousin shelly, but=
 i dont really want her to know what is going on between us.  i guess i sti=
ll feel somewhat awkward with you being married and all and then being at m=
y house - and with things progressing as they are between us.  i just feel =
strange.   like this "feels right", but it "is not right".  i really enjoy =
being with you,  but i guess i'd be much more at ease if you were not attac=
hed.  i am sorry to mention this all over again.  i know it is the last thi=
ng you need to hear on a monday morning.  i dont know what your plans are -=
 and you probably dont know what your plans for the future are as your marr=
iage is concerned.  and you dont  need to answer me.  i am not asking for a=
n answer or explanation - just venting i guess.   i hope you understand whe=
re i am coming from.   do you ever experience this?   this odd feeling that=
 i am experiencing?

i dont know.  maybe i dont know what i am talking about.   maybe b/c "my li=
ttle friend" is visiting i tend to be a little more sensitive than usual.  =
 i feel so uncomfortable today - maybe that is more info than you need to k=
now, right now.   sorry......i guess its a female thing.......  : - (

well i hope that the rest of your day goes well.=20

Hey what is going on?  How did you sleep last nite.  I didn't sleep well.  =
I had weird dreams.  Anyway, I had a wonderful time yesterday.  I hope you =
did as well.  You have a very nice room.  Everything a person needs.  A nic=
e soft bed, a tv, a closet, a computer and a nice soft bed, oh did I mentio=
n that already, I guess that is on my mind. =20

Have a wonderful day and I will talk to you soon.

I might need a ride today, are you still okay with that?  I have to call th=
e dealership when they open.  Thank you for offering.
