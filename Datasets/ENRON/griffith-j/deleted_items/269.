It is good to hear from you Bilal.  I hope things are going well.  Good luck with talking to everyone.  I guess the only advise I have is to keep sending out resumes.  Go to all the web based recruiting sites and send out your resume to anything that looks interesting.  Also, talk to a recruiter as well.  Are you working with one now?  

Anyway, nothing is going on here.  Just waiting around.  I hate it.  I guess I feel lucky to have a job.  They are not communicating very well with the employees.  I can't wait until all of this is over.

Take care and let me know if you need anything.

John

Hi John,
Hope you had great holidays. I just wanted to update you on my progress. I
returned on Jan 6th after taking some time off from job search and have been
in active discussion with MRE Consulting and Dynegy. Although I have not
received an offer from either I am hopeful.

At Caminus I emailed Debbie and unfortunately I could not set up a time to
meet her before New Years. She has been on vacation since then and i am
looking forward to meeting her when she gets back. I think after Caminus I
would feel comfortable making a decision.

Do you have any suggestions/thoughts? Once again thanks a lot for looking
out for me!
Bilal
