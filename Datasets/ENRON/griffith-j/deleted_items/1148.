You called me the other night.....on my mobile and at home....you also left
a message that you would
call back sometime this weekend...I called your house not 1 minute after you
called my mobile...you wouldn't answer....
I also left messages several times after that....If that is the best you can
do...then I don't need it....
Someone has to stand up and say that's not good enough!!!!!    Family
doesn't treat family that way!!!!!
Enough is enough!!!!!!!!!       My kids don't even know who Uncle  Johnny
Boy is any more...and that is a shame!!!!
I love you more than a real brother and I am truly sorry if this hurts your
feelings...hell, you might decide to even not talk to me any more....but it
sorta seems like you alraedy decided that...so I don't have anything to lose
by sending this...
I still love you whether you want to love me back or not.....Mike
