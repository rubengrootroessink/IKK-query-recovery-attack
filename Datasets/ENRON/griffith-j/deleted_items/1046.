John,
 
I tried to call you at work a little while ago, but they said you were gone for the day.  My cable modem has been out all day long and just came up 2-3 minutes ago.  
 
Sorry for not getting you a solution before you left.  I will look at the file (I see it in my inbox) and if I can tell you how to apply the fix, I'll send you a note.
 
Greg
