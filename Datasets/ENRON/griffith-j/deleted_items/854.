My evening was fine, just watched a little tv then went to sleep before 9pm.  It was nice to get that much sleep.  I feel really good today.  I would have loved to been at Foley's with you last nite, sounds like a lot of fun.

Good morning, how are you this morning?  You look good as usual.  Did you have a good time last nite?  I missed being with you this morning.  It is a nice way to start the day.  I hope that everything works out with us.  I don't want to put you in a bad situation, I care about you too much.  Have a great day and I will talk/email you soon.
