Not much going on over here.  Just hanging out waiting on the sale of the trade group.  I have interviewed with a couple of people.  I have one offer, not taking it yet though.  I think I would be giving up too much over here at Enron at this time.  Anyway, things are okay.

No I do not know Cassandra Shultz.  Is she from Enron?

Happy New Year and take care.  Tell Debby hi.  Talk to you soon.

John

Happy New Year!~

Hope you had a great holiday under the circumstances.  What's happening now?

Do you know Cassandra Shultz?

She just got the CRO at Keyspan.
