Yes I am here for the time being.  I am awaiting word on the sale of the trade group.  I have been interviewing a little and just hanging out.  How are you?  Have you been interviewing?  I am leaving right now to go interview with RWE.  A German Utility starting up a North America energy trading group.  Send me your phone numbers so that I can call you sometime.  My home number is (713) 527-8743.  I hope everything is well and hope to talk to you soon.

John

Johnny,
 
Before I type a lengthy email or  attempt to call you, email me back if you are still there.
