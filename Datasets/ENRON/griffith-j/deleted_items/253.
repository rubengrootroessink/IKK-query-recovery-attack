                              HELLO  FRIEND
      READ  THIS VERY SLOWLY.......
      IT'S PRETTY  PROFOUND..................
      STOP AND THINK  ABOUT LIFE........
      Too  many people put off something that brings them joy  just
      because they haven't thought about  it, don't have it on their
      schedule,  didn't know it was coming or are too rigid to  depart
      from their  routine.
      I got to thinking one day  about all those women on the Titanic
      who  passed up dessert at dinner that fateful night in an  effort
      to cut  back.
      From then on, I've tried to be  a little more flexible.
      How many  women out there will eat at home because  their
      husband didn't suggest going out to  dinner until after something
      had been  thawed?  Does the word "refrigeration" mean  nothing
      to  you?
      How often have your kids dropped  in to talk and sat in silence
      while you  watched Jeopardy! on television?
      I  cannot count the times I called my sister and said, "How  about
      going to lunch in a half hour?" She  would gasp and stammer, "I
      can't.  I  have clothes on the line. My hair is dirty. I wish I  had
      known yesterday, I had a late  breakfast, It looks like rain."   And
      my personal favorite: "It's  Monday." She died a few years ago.
      We  never did have lunch  together.
      Because Americans cram so  much into their lives, we tend  to
      schedule our headaches.  We live  on a sparse diet of promises
      we make to  ourselves when all the conditions are  perfect:
      We'll go back and visit the  grandparents when we get  Stevie
      toilet-trained.
      We'll  entertain-when we replace the living-room  carpet.
      We'll go on a second  honeymoon when we get two more kids
      out  of college.
      Life has a way of  accelerating as we get older.  The days  get
      shorter, and the list of promises to  ourselves gets longer.
      One morning,  we awaken, and all we have to show for our  lives
      is a litany of  "I'm going  to,"  "I plan on" and "Someday,  when
      things are settled down a  bit."
      When anyone calls my 'seize the  moment! ' friend, she is open
      to  adventure and available for trips.  She keeps an open  mind
      on new  ideas.
      Her enthusiasm for life is  contagious. You talk with her for  five
      minutes, and you're ready to trade  your bad feet for a pair of
      Rollerblades  and skip an elevator for a bungee  cord.
      My lips have not touched ice  cream in 10 years. I love ice cream.
      It's  just that I might as well apply it directly to my hips with  
      spatula and eliminate the digestive  process.
      The other day, I stopped the  car and bought a triple-decker.   If
      my car had hit an iceberg on the  way home, I would have  died
      happy.
      Now...go  on and have a nice day. Do something youWANT
      to......not something on your SHOULD DO  list.
      If you were going to die soon  and had only one phone call you
      could  make, who would you call and what would you say?   And
      why are you  waiting?
      Make sure you read this to the end; you will  understand
      why I sent this to  you. 
Have you ever watched kids playing on a merry go  round.  
Or listened to the rain lapping on  the ground? 
Ever followed a butterfly's erratic  flight
Or gazed at the sun into the  fading night? 
You better slow down.  Don't dance so  fast.  
Time is short.  The music  won't last. 
Do you run through each day on the fly? 
When  you ask, "How are you?"  Do you hear the reply? 
When the day  is done, Do you lie in your bed
with the next hundred chores  running through your head? 
Ever told your child,  We'll do it  tomorrow,  
And in your haste, not see his  sorrow? 
Ever lost touch?  Let a good friendship  die?  
Just call to  say "Hi"? 
You'd better slow down.  Don't  dance so fast.  
Time is short. The music won't  last.  
 
When you run so fast  to get somewhere, 
You miss half the fun of getting  there. 
When you worry and hurry through your  day,
It is like an unopened  gift....Thrown away...
 
Life is not a race.   Take it slower.  
Hear the music before the song is  over.
      It's National Friendship  Week.  Show your friends how
      much  you  care. 
            Thanks  for being my friend.
