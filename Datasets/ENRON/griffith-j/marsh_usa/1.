Doug,

As we discussed, I am trying to get a feel for pricing if an insurance
company or companies  were to hedge some potential price exposures.
Please assume that the credit quality of your counterparty is A rated
or better.  Attached are some hypothetical volumes to hedge.  The
actual volumes hedged may be less or more.  I would sugest we look at a
cap and a swap (pay fixed, receive floating).  It would be appreciated
if you would please provide some indicative quotes.

If you need more please let me know.

Thanks.

Best regards,

Bob
