NYMEX BOARD EXTENDS PROPRIETARY FEE REDUCTION PROGRAM

At its meeting on March 7, 2001, the NYMEX Board of Directors determined to
extend the current Proprietary Fee Reduction Program ("Program") through
April 30, 2001.

Pursuant to the Program, Member Firms and individuals members who own seats
will have their NYMEX Division fees reduced by 12 cents per round turn (6
cents per trade side).

Individual members who lease their seats, or hold a membership under an ABC
Agreement, will have their NYMEX Division fees reduced by 2.5 cents per
round turn (or 1 ? cents per trade side).

Clearing Members who clear Member Firm trades should adjust their billing
systems accordingly.

Clearing Members clearing floor members' accounts should not adjust their
billing systems for such individual members.  NYMEX issues payments
directly to individual members based upon their trading activity.

Floor members who execute Type 3 trades are asked to pay special attention
to NYMEX Rule 6.18 (B) (ii), requiring the executing member to report the
alpha code (badge symbol) of the receiving member on PTS.

Should you have any questions regarding this matter, please feel free to
contact M. Dawn Lowe or Donna Talamo at (212) 299-2370.
