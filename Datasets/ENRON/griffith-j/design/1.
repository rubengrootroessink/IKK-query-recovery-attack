The new, 1-15 December edition of designzine.com  includes the kind of 
articles on cutting-edge subjects and ideas that readers  of our member 
'zines have come to expect. For example, find out everything you  ever wanted 
to know about the outspoken Murray Moss and were afraid to ask,  in 
Intramuros.  Maria Bottero discusses the pioneer Bucky Fuller, in Abitare.  
And then there's the short survey, "Filming Hotels," by Silvana 
Annicchiarico,  in Modo.

In addition to these articles, there are more than  15 others with all the 
text and all the images from the latest issues of our  nine members. And 
remember that the Calendar  remains definitive.

In case you have designstand.com  coupons you wish to redeem, take a stroll 
down the aisles of the store to see  if there's something you want to pick 
out for the coming holidays. The virtual  doors of designstand.com, whose 
paint  may still be wet, have just swung open. 

Cordially,

Mel Byars
