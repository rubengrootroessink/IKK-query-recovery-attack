John,

Thanks for that...I shall recommend Totem to all US enquirers in the future.


There are lots of very exciting things in the pipeline... but I can't tell
you what they are just yet.


Best regards,

Thank you very much for your email.  One thing I would like to let you guys
know.  I called the company in California (Leif Petersen).  They gave me
the company that carries Magis here in Houston.  The name of the company is
Cantoni.  They are not what I would call a good furniture design store.
They carry alot of very cheesy (sorry for lack of better words) Italian
furniture.  I called them to inquire about the Coast chair.  They said that
they carry Magis furniture and the time for ordering would be approximately
3 months.  No big deal, however, when I asked about price, they would not
answer that over the phone.  They wanted me to come into the store so that
they could consult me.  I don't think I need to be consulted on design.  I
know what I want and all I was using them for was to order.  They said it
was store policy not to quote prices over the phone because of competition.
Competition is what the whole world is all about.  I will not be buying
anything from them anytime soon.  I called Totemdesign and they are finding
all the information out for me.  Totem is so great.  They have helped me
with many things.  I just bought an Orgone chair that I expect to receive
in about a week.

Sorry for the rambling on, I guess what I was getting at is that if you
have any say so about who carries Marc's designs, I don't think that
Cantoni is worthy.  Just take that for what it is worth.

Thank you for your time and consideration and I look forward to talking to
you in the future.  Please keep me informed about anything exciting going
on with Marc's designs or any new products coming out.  I am very excited.

Sincerely,

John Griffith
