John,

Please find details for the distributor for the Coast chair manufactured by
MAGIS:


Leif Petersen Inc. 15 Woodland Avenue San Rafael CA 94901

T+1 415 45 355 00
F+1 415 48 507 76

Personally I like the Orgone chair very much but I don't know how to compare
it with his other pieces...It is to my mind quite unique and a beautiful
piece to look at standing alone in a space.


Regards,


Patsy Youngstein
For Marc Newson Ltd
