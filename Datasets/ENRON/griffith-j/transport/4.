John--Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.  I am available to meet Wed 
or Thurs (20th or 21st)--why don't you see if Greg is available any time 
before 1:00 either of those two days?  I will be on vacation this Friday and 
all of next week.   (That is if you two haven't already met about this).

Colleen and Greg,

I talked to Zimin today and he agreed with me on the change to the model.  
There are basically 3 columns in the model that need to be changed.  Let me 
know when you want to get together to make the change and run parallel.  
Thanks.

John
