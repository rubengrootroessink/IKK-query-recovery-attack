Hey Dad,

The entertainment books you can gt online are at: entertainment.com and the
NDB number is: #624464. I'm not sure when the dead line is but i think it
might be sometime this week. Let Aunt Janelle, Markie, and whoever else
wants one that they can get it online. Order it as soon as possible because
i don't know when the dead line is. Love you

Carla :)
