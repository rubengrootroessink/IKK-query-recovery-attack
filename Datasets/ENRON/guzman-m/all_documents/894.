                         NOTE FROM CHRIS:

             According to a book written by a former
           Cambridge University researcher, a parrot in
            Manhattan can read the mind of its owner.

               "But Chris," you say, "How do I know
                if MY pet has psychic abilities?"
              Fear not!  Here's how you can tell...


           The Top 13 Signs Your Pet Can Read Your Mind


13> You think about having him neutered and the next time you're
    taking a bath, Rover brings you the toaster.

12> They start throwing feces before you even get the typewriters
    out of their cartons.

11> When you fake throwing the ball, he fakes being fooled.

10> "Bwawk!  Polly wanna new gold cage, or else Polly's telling
    Larry King about your rubber hose fetish and what you did
    with that watermelon.  Bwawk!"

 9> Well *someone* ordered the cat-size purple silk turban and
    crystal ball squeaky toy.

 8> You ask for your slippers.  Rover brings you Penthouse.

 7> He times his litter box usage so that total poop-smell
    permeation in your apartment occurs at EXACTLY the same
    moment your date arrives.

 6> The freakin' ferret *always* blocks your Triple-Word Score
    move.

 5> You toss your "Inauguration '93" commemorative Frisbee over
    by the sunbathing babes, and good ol' Buddy comes back with
    two bikini tops.

 4> Spot's able to guess 10 times out of 10 that it's Alpo for
    dinner.

 3> No matter where you hide the key to the liquor cabinet, by the
    time you get home from work, Fido's halfway through the peach
    Schnapps, watching "Beaches," and crying like a baby.

 2> You get the strange feeling that your cat is ignoring you on
    a whole *new* level.


  and Topfive.com's Number 1 Sign Your Pet Can Read Your Mind...


 1> The Waco-style armed standoffs that begin an hour before
    Sparky's trips to the vet.

                      Rumination of the Day

        If it's true that unprotected sex with someone is
         like having sex with everyone they had sex with,
           and everyone *they* had sex with, and so-on,
           then that must mean that in some roundabout
          way most of us have had sex with Kevin Bacon.

                         (Paul Aldredge)
