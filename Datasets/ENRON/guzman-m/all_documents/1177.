Hey!

I had along talk with Joel at Cargill today and discussed future business 
opportunities with them. As everybody that worked this weekend knows Cargill 
has been buying from EL PASO at way above market all Saturday and Sunday. 
They are taking this power to MARKETPLACE where LA Trannie is taking it to 
NOB S/N. They are selling this power to utilities in the NW for a low price. 
They do no do to much business in the West and don't have our knowledge and 
connections. I told Joel that we would be very interested in buying this from 
him at a competitive price.  

Whoever works Monday day needs to set up a BPA Account for LADWP - SNO 
account on the DC with Enron paying everything. 

I also discussed the posibility of us selling them power at MEAD. They would 
not want the 7MW scraps from LV, but are very interested in the LV 50MW 
pieces from 11-16. This could be a good way of selling LV at a very good 
price. 

I do believe they have this trannie all month and this could be a really 
sweat deal for us. So lets be "fair" to these guys as I am sure once we get 
to know them there are other things we can do with them. 

Cargill Telephone# 952-984-3865.

Before we are certain who is leaving and who is staying it might not be the 
best idea to talk to loud about this as we do not necessarily want this to be 
known to everybody.
