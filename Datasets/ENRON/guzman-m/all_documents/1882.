12:54 GMT 27 October 2000 DJ REPEAT:Cal ISO Board OKs Load Differentiated
Price Caps
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--The California Independent System Operator passed a
motion 13-10 late Thursday to implement load-differentiated wholesale power
price caps to be effective Nov. 3, 2000, or as soon after that date as
possible.
The cap would start at $65 a megawatt-hour for an off-peak load below 25,000
megawatts. The cap would increase to $90/MWh at 25,000-30,000 MW, $105/MWh
at 30,000-35,000 MW, $135/MWh at 35,000-40,000 MW, and would remain at the
existing $250/MWh price cap for any load above 40,000 MW.
The cap is based on actual power prices realized in 1999 at differt load
levels, then adjusted upward for current natural gas prices, said board
member Mike Florio, who drafted the motion.
The cost of natural gas will be figured using the average closing price of
New York Mercantile Exchange natural gas futures contracts for Henry Hub
during the last three trading days of the Nymex contract.
Florio stressed the caps were meant to be temporary, and would be removed as
soon as "comprehensive market changes were implemented and the real-time and
ancillary servicave demonstvariety of load conditions, that they are
workably competitive," according to the motion.
The caps would also be void if the ISO Board or Federal Energy Regulatory
Commissioed to vote on certain maret redesign proposals Thursday, but
elected to wait until more information on those proposals came in. As well,
commissioners wanted to wait until the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
issues its report Nov. 1 on California's electricity market.
Commissioners who opposed the price cap said the vote should be taken in the
context of the completed market redesign proposals, as well as any FERC
orders.
"I think this may take a while to implement," said ISO President Terry
Winter, who voted against the caps. "What do I do if FERC comes out with an
order contrary to this on Nov. 1?"

DJ Power Sales May Pare Calif Utils' $4.6 Bln Summer Loss

   By Mark Golden
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

(This is a revised version of an item published Thursday.)
NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--California's two big utilities have said that having
to buy power at market prices and deliver it to customers at regulated rates
has cost them $4.6 billion since May.
But more than 40% of that money has been paid into accounts the utilities
own because the utilities are still the biggest generators of electricity in
the state.
Since California wholesale power prices began to rise in May, Southern
California Edison, the regulated utility unit of Edison International (EIX),
has paid the California Power Exchange $2.358 billion more on electricity
than SCE is allowed to collect from customers.
Through September, however, the CalPX has paid the utility about $1.3
billion over its generating costs for electricity sold into the state's
wholesale power market, SCE's Chief Financial Officer Jim Scilacci said
Thursday in an interview.
Likewise in Northern California, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas &
Electric Co. through August paid the CalPX $2.2 billion more for electricity
than it could collect from its customers. During that time, however, the
CalPX paid PG&E $700 million over its generating costs for power the utility
sold, according to PG&E spokesman Ron Low.
Loretta Lynch, chairwoman of the California Public Utilities Commission, and
the Utility Reform Network, a consumer group, want the utilities to use
those gains to offset some of their electricity purchase losses.
The utilities, however, say that the gains from their power plants aren't
"profits," as TURN calls them. The money has gone to pay off so-called
stranded assets - debts left over from building nuclear power plants before
deregulation, and expensive long-term supply contracts the utility was
forced to purchase in the 1980's and is still paying for.
With income from its generators so high, those debts have been paid off much
earlier than expected, and both utilities' stranded-asset accounts are now
overcollected by hundreds of millions of dollars.
One of the major questions state regulators face is what to do with that
money.
Utilities Say Power-Sale Revenue Only Partial Solution
SCE would support paying off the revenue shortfall with the asset
overcollection only as part of an overall revision of deregulation that must
include an end to the current rate freeze, Scilacci said.
Beyond that, the utility wants the CPUC to "confirm that utilities will be
permitted to recover their reasonable procurement costs incurred on behalf
of customers," according to a regulatory plea it made late Wednesday.
SCE has proposed a rate increase of up to 10% for its customers and is
seeking refunds from independent power producers and power trading
companies, which it says are charging illegally high prices.
Customers who leave the utility and start buying electricity from SCE's
competitors in Southern California should also be forced to help pay off the
debts incurred this year, SCE's chief executive, Stephen E. Frank, said in a
press conference Thursday.
PG&E says that using the asset overcollections to pay off the purchased
power undercollections won't solve the problem completely.
"Assuming that prices during the summer of 2001 are similar to those
experience during the summer of 2000, the unrecovered balance in (purchased
power costs) will grow to more than double its current level by the end of
August 2001," PG&E said in its own filing Wednesday. "Generation revenues
from PG&E's hydro and Diablo Canyon plants above costs would offset only
about one-quarter of the increase in the undercollection from the same
period."
Under current regulations, overcollection for stranded assets is to be
refunded to customers.
Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric emerged a year ago from
its transition to competitive markets and this August sent $390 million in
checks to its 1.1 million customers.
SCE has assumed for the purposes of its own analysis that its stranded-asset
overcollection would go toward reducing rates going forward, rather than to
sending checks to customers as SDG&E did.
