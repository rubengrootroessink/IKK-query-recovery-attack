Lately there have been several questions concerning transmission purchases 
from WACM or BCHA.  In order to access these OASIS Nodes we need to log on to 
Trade Agent in Terminal Server.  The Trade Agent login is on the same menu as 
Enpower and CAPS.  Open Trade Agent and log in using the EPMI Control Room 
Certificate.   Trade Agent will then prompt you for the password.  Please see 
me for the password.  You will then be able to access the OASIS websites and 
schedule power across the rockies(Canadian or US).  The websites can be found 
in Cara's emails concerning the Westpower scheduling database.
Please take the time to become familiar with this system.
