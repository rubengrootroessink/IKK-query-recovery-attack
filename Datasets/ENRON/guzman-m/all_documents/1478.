BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

BA&R Merchant Finance
Not your typical "bean counters", the BA&R Merchant Finance group is=20
responsible for maintaining and reporting the accounting valuations of the=
=20
ENA merchant portfolio, coordinating the quarterly revaluation of the=20
portfolio and directing the Arthur Andersen quarterly review (during earnin=
gs=20
release) and year end audit.  Customers include ENA Office of the Chair,=20
Corporate Reporting group during quarterly earnings release, commercial=20

the accounting and reporting needs of the Principal Investments, Energy=20

commercial groups.  With the recent realignment of ENE lines of businesses,=
=20
the group has recently been involved in the successful transition of mercha=
nt=20
assets into newly formed Enron Global Markets.  The group has also been=20

EnTelligence?
No, its not spelled wrong, it's the name of a prospecting website in ENA=20
designed to deliver market information on existing and potential customers =
to=20
commercial trading, mid-marketing, and origination teams.  It also delivers=
=20
management reports to analyze Enron=01,s position within the key industries=

Credit Aggregation System (CAS), Sitara, Enpower, and ERMS with information=

to identify customer prospects.  By providing the capability to filter and=

improved. Available reports include Market Penetration, Industry Prospectin=

NEWS FROM THE GLOBALFLASH

Enron Direct
Enron Direct was recently cited by Ofgem for high complaint levels with=20
regard to account complaints per total customers served.  Enron Direct view=
s=20
the Ofgem customer service measures very seriously and is committed to=20
improving all aspects of its customer service - even while enjoying continu=
ed=20
strong growth in its retail commodity business.   However, the account=20
complaint level measure is particularly biased against fast-growing new=20
entrants like Enron Direct.  Since all of Enron Direct's customers have=20
recently switched suppliers - which is when most complaints occur - and our=
=20
total customer base is far lower than that of the RECs, our account complai=
nt=20
levels per customer tend to appear inflated versus the REC peer group.   In=
=20
fact, Enron Direct's complaint levels for both transfers (i.e., switchers)=
=20
and mis-selling, as measured by Ofgem, were well below industry averages. =

While we are not yet best-in-class, Enron Direct's portrayal as an industry=

laggard in any aspect of customer service is misleading.  Stay tuned.

As part of the agreement, UPM-Kymmene has requested a dedicated account=20
manager in Oslo.  In order to comply with this request, we have appointed=

to coordinate all Enron relations with UPM-Kymmene regarding power related=

It is important that all Enron businesses take advantage of this unique=20
