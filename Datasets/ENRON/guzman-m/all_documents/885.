Short Term Cali is short NP and long SP for HE 1-7, 23 and 24 tomorrow 
(03/07).  Please look in ECTSTCali to check theshort amounts in PGE2 and PGE 
3, length is in SCE1 and SDGE1 under ECTSTCali and EES 2.  Please do the 
ST-Cali deals under the ST-Cali book.  We will split ST-Cali profits in SP 
50/50 over $150.  Any EES2 sale are still $5(deals under ST-Whourly).  In the 
North we will just buy for ST-Cali to help them cover their short (again 
deals under ST-Cali).  IF you have any questions please call.
