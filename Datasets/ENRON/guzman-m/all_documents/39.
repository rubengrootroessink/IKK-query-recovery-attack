Just wanted to make sure you saw this from Les Rawson concerning Grays Harbor 
and Willamette.
-Bill

Beginning immediately Enron has purchased Control Area Reserves service from 
BPA. 

The allows Services to sell Unit contingent energy as hourly firm since BPA 
is suppling reserves for up to 60 Minutes. If Grays Harbor Paper notifies RT 
of a unit derate or outage RT should notify BPA dispatch immediately and make 
the reduction in the schedule during the next ramp. For example should Grays 
unit trip as 1333 RT would notify BPA and the sink that across the top of the 
hour for 1400 the schedule would be taken to zero for HE 1400. The bottom 
line is that 60 minutes is the maximum time BPA will carry the schedule.

Send me a e-mail concerning any reductions for Grays since the energy would 
need to be repaid back within 168 hours.

Also, for May Services sold 10 mw of UC energy to EWEB from Willamette all 
hours. As part of this sale Services bought 18 Mw of firm transmission from 
PACW to BPAT for all hours. 10Mw of this purchase will be used for the 
monthly sale with the remaining 8Mw used for day ahead and hourly sales. The 
Assignment Reference # 139990. The cost for this transmission is $2.72 per 
hour vs the $5.84 we normally pay for hourly non-firm so hopefully we can 
save some money on PAC transmission.

Also, beginning May 1 Services purchased Ancillary Services from PacifiCorp 
to allow Willamette's Unit Contingent energy to be sold as 1-hour firm with 
reserves. The procedure for dealing with inner hour cuts is similar to Grays 
with the exception of not calling PAC RT dispatch. Simply cut or reduce the 
schedule at the next ramp and note the derate in a e-mail to Services. This 
service adds .43 cents per Mw to the term sale costs. However, this service 
applies to Willamette's sales up to 30Mw.

Let me know if there are questions.

Les
