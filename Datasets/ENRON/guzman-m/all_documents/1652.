19:42 GMT 28 November 2000 DJ Class Action/Calif Generators-3: Antitrust Law
Violated
The "class" - the plaintiffs - are defined as anybody who bought power
through the California Power Exchange last summer, but largely represents
the 1.2 million customers of Sempra Energy unit (SRE) San Diego Gas &
Electric Co., according to the complaint.
The complaint alleges the defendants violated antitrust laws.
The plaintiffs allege that the generators named in the suit deliberately
withheld their power supply from the CalPX forward market, scheduled
unplanned power plant outages and congested transmission lines last summer
in an effort to drive up wholesale power prices.
Houston-based Reliant Energy Inc. (REI), operates five power plants in
California. Atlanta-based Southern Company (SO) operates six generation
units in the state; Houston-based Duke Energy (DUK) operates four power
plants; Houston-based Dynegy (DYN) operates eight power plants in
California; Arlington, Va.-based AES operates four, Tulsa, Okla.-based
Williams Energy operates three generation units and Minneapolis-based NRG
operates eight power plants.
In addition, the suit claims the California Independent System Operator,
manager of the state's high voltage transmission system, wrongfully supplied
the Western Systems Coordinating Council, an agency that manages electricity
reliability in the west, with real-time information about power plant
outages and electricity generating and capacity levels that was used by
generators to manipulate the market.
"Through the WSCC Internet web site, wholesale electricity market
participants ... were thereby given access to real-time data as to their
competitors' actions, although access to such data was forbidden by the
ISO's (rules)," the complaint states.
"Starting on or about May 22, 2000, defendants used such real-time data to
exercise market power, by among other things, reducing their (electricity)
output, strategically underbidding supply to the forward markets and
exporting electricity from the state in order to drive up" power prices, the
complaint further states.
The defendants weren't immediately available for comment.
