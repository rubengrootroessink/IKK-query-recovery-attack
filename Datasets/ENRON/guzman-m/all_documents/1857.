Touche'

Clearly those in power are interested in one thing--preserving their 
privileged position and the status quo.  My opponent is for big lycra.  I 
don't trust big lycra.  I trust the people, and their own ears.

I will make a pledge right now that if I am selected to win next year in 
advance, I will NOT wear camouflage lycra on Halloween.  (This pledge alone 
should ensure my victory).

Furthermore, since my worthy opponent nearly had to pass out earplugs as a 
form of defense against the colorful nature of his costume, I think he should 
be the last to make allegations regarding "visual impairment."  Is that what 
"visions and values" is all about?

I for one believed the judging to be objective and fair. Clearly, "price 
caps" are out of favor. Enron's totally impartial judges, and FERC's 
independent analysis, reached  the same (appropriate) conclusion.  As for 
fatigues, they are difficult to see, so how can one expect to be evaluated 
on  a costume that is visually disadvantaged. 

The foundation of  Enron's business is competition. Obviously, the 
exceptional wisdom of the independent judges recognized that cycling is a 
highly competitive activity. Therefor, a cycling costume reflected the spirit 
of Enron and the Halloween competition. 

 My suggestion to Mr. Rasmussen for next years competition is that he wear 
lycra camouflage.
