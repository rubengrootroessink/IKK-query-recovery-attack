Hi Mark,
I'm really sorry to have heard about your Dad. I know I'm just one on a long 
list of people that always enjoyed his company, hospitality and high 
spirits...he always treated me like a bro and I know how much he meant to you.
I'm heading north to Humboldt with Stacey this afternoon (been in Sac all 
week) and will probably be there for a little while.  Be sure to let me know 
where you're gonna be, 'cause I plan on heading further north sometime.
Hope to see you soon, and I'll be in touch until then...
-Marc
