If you have purchased this transmission,   but will not be using it,   please 
leave the megawatts populated in Enpower with a comment explaining that we 
didnt use for this hour.
This transmission is take or pay and we need to reflect this expense properly 
to avoid customer disputes.

You may see this situation if LV Cogen's unit goes down.

I realize that this will leave Enpower out of balance by the amount of the 
transmission,  but Valarie in Risk Mgmt agrees with this procedure.

Does everyone understand this request?
