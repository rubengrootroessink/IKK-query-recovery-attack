Group,

I wanted to passback some important feedback from the Enron Canada group 
concerning our notes on restatements.  In the notes section of the calgary 
website (see my previous email), we need to input the mws dispatched in EVERY 
call we have.  Enron Canada considers it very important that we have every 
call in the log.  For example:

Entry #1; 01:33...Gary at Powerpool called to dispatch us up to 358 mws from 
352 mws, Transalta excess energy now in merit.
Entry #2; 01:34...Joe at Transalta Plant, called Joe and had him go to 358 
from 352 mws.

and then later on in the evening.

Entry #3; 03:21...Gary at Powerpool called to dispatch us down to 352 mws 
from 358 mws, Transalta excess energy no longer in merit order.
Entry #4; 03:22...Joe at Transalta Plant, called Joe and had him go to 352 
mws from 358mws.

So basically we need to say the time and mws for each call, and whether or 
not the excess energy (anything over 353 MWhs) is in or out of merit.
We also need to be sure to identify restatements because of plant derates, as 
well as the cause of the derate.  This information is VERY important to our 
custormer (Enron Canada) for settlements and payments to Transalta.  
Consequently it should be important to us.  You should all be familiar with 
the systems by now.  If you have any questions, please ask me.  I would like 
to prove our competency on these issues.

Thank you.

Bill
