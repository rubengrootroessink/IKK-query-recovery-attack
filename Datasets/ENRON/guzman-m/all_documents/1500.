Subject: PX HA cut on Sunday, 5/28

Following is an email I sent a few weeks ago.  The parts in GREEN are new.  
Please read this again to make sure you understand how PX cuts should be 
handled.  The reason for the change is we had Pete Davis adjust the 
Enpower-to-PX report to also include Enpower deals where the counterparty is 
CalPX-Time Removal.

If the PX calls to tell us of an hour-ahead cut, leave the prescheduled deals 
in Enpower alone.  In Enpower, enter a purchase from the Cal PX Time Removal 
for the curtailed mws @ the PXHA Index price, and a corresponding sale to the 
counterparty (in this case, EPE) for the same mws and @ the same index.  The 
index should be a negative price, so the above deal entries would show us 
ultimately paying the counterparty (selling @ a negative price) and receiving 
money from the PX (buying @ a negative price).  This is because we (in this 
case, "we" is ultimately EPE) are being paid for getting off of the curtailed 
line and relieving congestion.  The Enpower-to-PX report will show the DA/HA 
deal with the original volume plus the new PX Time Removal deal for the 
curtailed mws.  These two deals will NET to the actual flow for that hour.  
The CAPS section of the report will show the ISO HA Final Schedules, which in 
this case is the actual mw flow.  This will result in no variance on the HA 
Enpower-to-PX report because the Enpower deals will tie to the PX schedules.

If the PX calls to tell us of a Real-Time cut, leave the prescheduled deals 
in Enpower alone.  In Enpower, enter a purchase from the Cal PX Time Removal 
for the curtailed mws @ the ISO Ex-Post Index price, and a corresponding sale 
to the counterparty for the same mws and @ the same index.  In this case, we 
are exposed to the ex-post price because the ISO is having to keep our supply 
whole to fill our load.  The Enpower-to-PX report will show the DA/HA deal 
with the original volume plus the new PX Time Removal deal for the curtailed 
mws.  These two deals will NET to the actual flow for that hour.  The CAPS 
section of the report will show the ISO HA Final Schedule, which in this case 
is not the actual mw flow.  Obviously, since Enpower nets to actual flow, and 
CAPS shows the HA Finals (which is not the actual flow volume), the 
Enpower-to-PX report will show a variance - which should be explained.

Hey.  Per our discussion w/Stokley:

For the deals Holden entered (#345975 and 345976) on 5/28, I changed the 
volume from 50mw to 12.4 mw (the actual curtailment amt) and I changed the 
index from ISOSP15 (expost) to PXHA AZ2.

Here's what I think the procedure for cuts should be going forward:

If the PX calls to tell us of an hour-ahead cut, leave the prescheduled deals 
in Enpower alone.  In Enpower, enter a purchase from the Cal PX Time Removal 
for the curtailed mws @ the PXHA Index price, and a corresponding sale to the 
counterparty (in this case, EPE) for the same mws and @ the same index.  The 
index should be a negative price, so the above deal entries would show us 
ultimately paying the counterparty (selling @ a negative price) and receiving 
money from the PX (buying @ a negative price).  This is because we (in this 
case, "we" is ultimately EPE) are being paid for getting off of the curtailed 
line and relieving congestion.  This will result in an explained variance on 
the HA Enpower-to-PX report because the Enpower deal will still show the DA 
volume, while the PX HA Final Schedules will show the curtailed volume.  This 
variance should be noted on the report that's left on my desk.

If the PX calls to tell us of a Real-Time cut, leave the prescheduled deals 
in Enpower alone.  In Enpower, enter a purchase from the Cal PX Time Removal 
for the curtailed mws @ the ISO Ex-Post Index price, and a corresponding sale 
to the counterparty for the same mws and @ the same index.  In this case, we 
are exposed to the ex-post price because the ISO is having to keep our supply 
whole to fill our load.  There will be no variance shown on the Enpower-to-PX 
report because both Enpower and the PX HA Final Schedules will show the DA 
volume.  What I need from RT in this case is to note on the report the hour 
and amount of the real-time cut.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

Brett
