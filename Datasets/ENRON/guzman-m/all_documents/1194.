Dear Leaf and Mark,

I'm researching a purchase deal for 25 MW @ $15 (probably ancillary charges) 
on 11-30-00 for HE 24.  

The counterparty is showing this deal, but we are not. 

I have found deal # 469836 routed to El Paso deal # 469839, but the criteria 
do not match completely.  I didn't find notes in either of your trade logs.  
Is there possibly a deal out there at HE 24 for exactly 25 MW @ $15.00? 

Please respond soon,

VA
