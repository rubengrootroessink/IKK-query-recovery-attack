Group,

When entering a physical annuity (for example, for the sale of ST-Cali length 
in SP-15), we need to make that the annuity starts and ends for 2 days from 
now, for 1 mw, for HE 1, for the appropriate dollar amount.  So today is the 
22nd, consequently I would make any annuity for deals done today, start and 
stop on the 24th, for HE 1.  I would like to observe this 2 day difference on 
every annuity that we make.  So, if you need an annuity for an amount on the 
23rd, make the annuity for the 25th.  Please be sure that the start and stop 
times for the deal and for the strip match.  An annuity will not flag  an 
error in a mismatch between the strip and the information on top like a 
forward deal.  

We are currently having many problems settling annuitys.  Extra comments in 
the comment sections can only help.  PLEASE ask questions of senior team 
members or myself, and get this right!

Thank you,
Bill
