Within the next few months we will be transitioning from our Lotus Notes 
email system to Microsoft Outlook and also upgrading to Windows 2000.  Our 
local IT department and our developmental IT department managers are involved 
in this project and will be coordinating efforts with the software Houston 
transition team to ensure the process goes well in Portland.

Over the course of the next few days, you will be receiving an e-mail from 
Project GEM.  The purpose of this e-mail is to inventory your PC to check for 
hardware and software requirements.  Please open this e-mail only from the PC 
that is your primary one.  This procedure takes under two minutes and will 
assist us in verifying your hardware and software requirements to make your 
transition to Windows 2000 smooth and seamless as possible.  

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the IT Department or 
Debra Davidson.
