We now have a self-calculating cuts template.  There are two, one located in 
P:/RealTime/Cuts_Worksheet   and one located in P:/Scheduling/Cuts_Template.

These are both write protected, but once you add your changes just do a save 
as and save as the date. This will allow you to calculate the cuts to your 
schedules very quickly, and verify their accuracy immediately. Spaces are 
provided to record paths, tag numbers and enpower deal numbers.  If you try 
this and think of improvements, please don't hesitate to get with me.

Also,  the extra SW transmission is now shown on the Available Transmission 
Capacity sheet in P:/Real Time.  Lisa will be updating the SW portion, and 
Mike will continue to do his updates in the NW portion.  The left column has 
been frozen to allow scrolling without losing the hour designation.

One last thing:  To have our CISO schedules on hand during these times,  just 
go to the lotus dbase, do a sort by global ID, expand the day you wish to 
see, and right click your mouse.  Select Print, and then in that dialog box 
select "Print View."    This will work with any dbase view you need in Lotus.
