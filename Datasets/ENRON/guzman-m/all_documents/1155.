Two new account numbers for your pleasure.

PowerPool to CISO hnf at Malin = 782426
Centralia to CISO hnf at Malin = 682493

Transalta will sell power at a discount at Centralia.

These account numbers as well as many more are located in P:\Realtime\RT BPA 
Account #'s.  The price on both is $5.06.

Thanks,
Holden
