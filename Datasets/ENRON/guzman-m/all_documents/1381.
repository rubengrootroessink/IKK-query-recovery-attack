I've emailed you since then... I thought.  Of course I'm talking to you.
How was New Years?  What did you do?  Mine was good.  Jesse and Matt just
had a party.  It was pretty chill, about 30 or more.  It was a good crowd
and then we went over to this little bar across the street from them until
about 2 or so... I don't remember.

So are you not talking to me anymore or something?  I emailed once and
called twice in the past week and a half  and haven't heard back from you?
