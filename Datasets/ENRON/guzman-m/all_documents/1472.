Hi Mark,

Hope you got the attachment okay that I sent.? If it weren't for the kids I'd 
probably make it my screen saver.? I'm sending you another one that I thought 
was nice but funny too!? 

Cita is doing better.? She back home and says she's feeling better.? But, She 
keeps teasing us with a cough that we have to watch real close.? The first 
few nights she stayed here after her release from the hospital were pretty 
tense.? She was afraid to go to sleep.? She continues to have visions of Bill 
at her bedside!? I keep telling her that he just wants to make sure the she 
stops mourning him because he's finally resting and very happy.? I tell her 
that if he was standing at "my" bedside then I?would surely have reason to 
worry and not sleep!!? Heck, what else can I say?? As always, I try to pop in 
some humor so she can hopefully see the funny side of life.

As fas as I know, we're going to be celebrating Christmas Eve here.? I'll let 
you know if that changes.? And please promise me that you'll keep the cost of 
my Christmas present just under $1,000 - promise?? If spend more I'll just 
have to give you a bigger hug!!? Just kidding!? It'll be a little hug!!

Are you good friends with any University of Oregon Alumni?? Let me know 
because I have a new client that wants to market a really cool UO neon 
light.? Plus, with all the hype of them going to the Holiday Bowl my client 
wants to jump on the fan excitement. (I'm sure they would've rather gone to 
the Fiesta Bowl and earned an extra twelve million dollars!!!)? Anyway, let 
me know if you know any UO Alumni.? Thanks.

Talk to ya soon - Love ya, mean it!?? Uncle Bob
