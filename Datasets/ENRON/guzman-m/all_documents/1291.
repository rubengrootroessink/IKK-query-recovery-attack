This schedule went real time HE 12 on 1/19 and continues through HE 23 on 
1/23.
HE 12-24 on 1/19 were wheeled to Hotsprings and sold to SCL.  We will need to 
sell these 3mw's for 1/20 - 1/22.  Enpower has not been changed so we will 
need to cut the sell to LP and link the RT sells to the PGE deals.

Thanks,
Holden

Subject: Montana System schedule has been curtailed......

PGE@COLSTRIP DAILY-PGE-EPMI-LOUISIANA PACIFIC, 7MW FLAT.  LP deal #421598.1, 
at Montana System.

Louisiana Pacific was getting 7mw flat from our PGE @ Colstrip daily 
purchase.  As of HE23pst on 1/19 and through 1-23, they need only 4mw an 
hour.  
Unfortunately, they called a little late for us to preschedule for 1/20-21, 
so Real time will need to sell off 3mw an hour from HE23pst on 1/19 through 
HE24 
on 1/22 at Montana system.  The deal numbers for the PGE buy are as follows:

1/19:  500047.1
1/20:  500048.1 and 500047.1
1/21:  500940.1
1/22:  500936.1 and 500935.1

The Lotus notes data base has not been changed for 1-19 but has been for 
1/20-22.

1/23 will be taken care of on preschedule.

Thank you.

Donald.
