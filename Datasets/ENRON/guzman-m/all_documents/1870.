2105GMT Details Of Report A Blow To State, Utils
NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--A federal regulatory report into California's
wholesale electricity market couldn't find evidence that power rates were
"unjust and unreasonable," a Democratic commissioner with the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission told Dow Jones Newswires Monday.
The probe, details of which are scheduled to be released Wednesday, is a
blow to California's three investor-owned utilities, state officials and
millions of retail electricity consumers - all of whom have accused
generators of manipulating the market, collusion and "profiteering."
The commissioner, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said "the report
couldn't find that power rates in California were unjust and unreasonable."
Dow Jones Newswires reported Friday that the FERC report also found no
evidence of abuse by energy companies operating in the state, and wouldn't
be ordering tens of millions of dollars in refunds to consumers and
utilities.
Instead, the commissioner said the market structure resulted, in part, in
higher wholesale electricity costs, and several changes, such as price caps,
exacerbated the situation.
The commissioner said the report would address sweeping structural changes
to the state's Independent System Operator, which controls the high-voltage
transmission grid, and the state's Power Exchange, where power is bought and
sold.
Gov. Gray Davis reacted to the news with disappointment, according to his
press secretary, Steve Maviglio. The governor is expected to address details
of the FERC report Wednesday.
