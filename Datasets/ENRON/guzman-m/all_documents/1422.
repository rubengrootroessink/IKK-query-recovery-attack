Louisiana Pacific,  Deal # 421598 is ramping down from 7 mw's to 2 mw's, 
leaving us 5 long PGE deal # 268656.  

The start of the ramp down is HE18 pst on 12/23, and will stay ramped down 
through HE 2100 on 1/1/01.  They are returning to their full 7mw starting HE 
2200 on January 1.

Real Time:

Please sell 5 mw's beginning HE 1800 on 12/23 through HW 2400 12/26. This is 
Portland@Colstrip, deal #268656. Enpower accurately reflects this length.

on 1/1/01, sell the same 5 mw length, same deal number, from HE 0100 through 
he 2100.




Preschedule: We will reduce our preschedule by the 5 mw's for 12/27 through 
12/21, but will schedule the full 7 mw's for 1/1/01, at which time we will 
need to remind real time that this length is there.
