Bob, Mark and Jorge,
here is a pretty cute email from Gina regarding the status of her visit to
Mexico.
I've just sent her your emails so she can send you future updates directly.
Dave

hi mi familia...
im here in mazatlan, enjoying the warm beach wheather. last night was the
carnaval, the biggest event in mazatlan, but i had a fever, so we=01%re jus=
t
taking it easy...we decided not to feel the pressure of driving to our
destination, rather we just are playing it safe...no stress. yesterday we
were in culiacan and we spent the whole day with the family. they are
soooooo nice!!! i contacted Jorge, the son of citas brother, guillermo. he
came to meet us for what i thought was just going to be breakfast. he and
his wife (i forget her name) and grandson Jorgito the 3rd drove us around
Culiacan to the registro civil, where i was looking for mom=01%s birth reco=
rd.
we were directed to go to navolato, which is about a half hour away, they
had no problem driving us there. it was going to take 3 days to have the
procces done, but since Jorge knows the people there, we had it done in 2
hours!!! we got some videos of the navolato, including where cito used to
work at the sugar refinery, and th!
e street where cito, cita, Uncle Jorge and mom used to walk. we then went
to visit Socorro, citas sister, her husband, and her sons Oscar and Carlos.
Socorro is so sweet and looks a lot like cita, inluding the use of a walker
due to a problem with her right hip. she was so extatic to see me and
immediately hugged me and didn=01%t let me go. her face was so lit up, i th=
ink
it meant a lot to her to have family come and visit, even though she hadnt
seen me since i was a child. she also asked about Beto!!! "hows Beto?", she
said.."Is he married yet?" the whole family was very nice and accomidating,
and we got lots of pictures and video, including a greeting from Socorro to
Cita and Ram?n. then we left from there and went to a bay nearby called
Altata where we ate the freshest seafood imaginable! by  the time jorge
dropped us of at my car, it was already night time, where we said our
goodbyes and planned to have another reunion in a few months, when we can
spend more time. it was trul!
y a "padrisimo" experience to see the area where mom was born, and dont
worry, Bob, i didn=01%t leave the pictures behind!!! i=01%ll be in contact =
again
soon, as we are planning to be in mexico city by friday night or saturday
morning to get to the concert "Unidos Por La Paz".. a benefit for peace in
Chiapas. Calling from here is very expensive, so i will  try to do more
emails. well, i love you all, and i hope you are all doing great!!
love Gina
ps..DAD!!! phone number to reach me in Mexico: 5-90-34-70  i love you!!!
