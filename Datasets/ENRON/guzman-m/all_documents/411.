Guz,

Sorry we missed you this last weekend.  Did you and your sister have a good 
weekend?  I remember you mentioning that you were going to take her to the 
Blazer game and some other things.

Give me a call soon, we are going to have to block out some time to watch the 
Blazer Laker series when it starts (if the trail gangsters can even get that 
far).

Later,

Rick
