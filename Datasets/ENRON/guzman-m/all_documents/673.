Group,

When importing/exporting or wheeling energy through California, it is 
important that the schedule ID is included in the inc or service sheet.  
Further, if an import/export or wheel is cut real-time (ie. over the phone 
after hour ahead finals are out), an email should be sent to volume 
management and such cuts or other occurrences should be noted in your day or 
night notes.  This information along with the real-time tag number allows 
other members of the West Desk (and those following you on shift) to do their 
job quickly and more accurately.  I understand that many of you are working 
long shifts and combating systems issues at the same time.  However, it is 
not acceptable to delay members of other groups because of a failure to 
communicate information readily available to us.

To make sure we are clear on this, the expectations are as follows:
      
 AN ORGANIZED AND COMPLETE INC/SERVICE SHEET AT START END OF SHIFT WITH 
SCHEDULE ID'S AND RT TAG #'S
 AN EMAIL TO VOLUME MANAGEMENT CONCERNING RT CUTS ON RT IMPORTS/EXPORTS AND 
WHEELS
 COMPLETE DOCUMENTATION OF THE DAYS EVENTS IN THE DISCUSSION NOTES

An inability to communicate with volume management or settlements is a 
performance issue.  I already receive reports on disputes and deal entry 
errors.  In addition, I will be asking volume management and settlements to 
provide feedback on each trader during the review process.

Thanks,
Bill
