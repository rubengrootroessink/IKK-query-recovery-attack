As promised...

1) Tuesday May 1st at 9:45 PM at Delta #4
2) Tuesday May 8th at 7:15 PM at Delta/Pepsi
3) Tuesday May 15th at 7:15 PM at Delta/Pepsi
4) Monday May 21st at 9:00 PM at Farragut
5) Monday June 4th at 9:00 PM at Farragut

Delta #4 - is at the Delta Park softball complex, however, its separate from 
the main fields.  This field is at the north end of the park.  In the past, 
we have played at Delta #1, which is at the south end of the park.

Delta/Pepsi - is at the Delta Park softball complex.  These are the real nice 
fields and the Pepsi field is marked with Pepsi signs in the outfield.  We 
have played on this field many times.

Farragut - is at N. Farragut and N. Kerby (Thomas guide 566 F4).  One way to 
get there is to take I-5 and take the Lombard exit.  Head east for a few 
blocks until you see Kerby then turn north and you cant miss the park.  We 
have played here a few times.

Again, any questions, comments, concerns, let me know.  I will bring 
photocopies of the schedule to our last practice on Saturday at 1PM.  Take it 
easy.
Chris
