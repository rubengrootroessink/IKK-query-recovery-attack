NEW CLIENT!!!

Grays Harbor Paper Company has 4 Mw available to sell AROUND the clock.  We 
need to schedule this energy from Grays Harbor PUD system to wherever we sell 
it.  Grays Harbor has no imbalance energy accounting system therefore this 
energy must be sold.  We begin selling the 4 mw tomorrow morning (03/07/01) 
for HE 1 PST.  They will be in Enpower as a counterparty tomorrow and the 
energy should be bought at Grays Harbor busbar.  We receive 20% of the gross 
$ amount for marketing these 4 mws.  We then split that number with Services 
75/25.  Holden has made the formula in the services sheet.  I will do the 
Enpower for the 6 and 7th on the 7th.  Stay tuned for more emails on how to 
book this new opportunity.
Good luck!
