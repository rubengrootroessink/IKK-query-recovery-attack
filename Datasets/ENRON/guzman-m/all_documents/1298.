PGE@COLSTRIP DAILY-PGE-EPMI-LOUISIANA PACIFIC, 7MW FLAT.  LP deal #421598.1, 
at Montana System.

Louisiana Pacific was getting 7mw flat from our PGE @ Colstrip daily 
purchase.  As of HE23pst on 1/19 and through 1-23, they need only 4mw an 
hour.  
Unfortunately, they called a little late for us to preschedule for 1/20-21, 
so Real time will need to sell off 3mw an hour from HE23pst on 1/19 through 
HE24 
on 1/22 at Montana system.  The deal numbers for the PGE buy are as follows:

1/19:  500047.1
1/20:  500048.1 and 500047.1
1/21:  500940.1
1/22:  500936.1 and 500935.1

The Lotus notes data base has not been changed for 1-19 but has been for 
1/20-22.

1/23 will be taken care of on preschedule.

Thank you.

Donald.
