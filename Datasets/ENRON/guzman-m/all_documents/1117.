Please note the following changes:
We would like to know the approximate number of attendees for the morning 
sessions, so please be sure to let me know which of the two sessions you are 
interested in attending.
The afternoon session will begin at 1:00pm, rather than 12:00pm
In order to keep the "flow" of traffic moving through Mt. Hood, please plan 
on stopping by at the top of the hour (1pm, 2pm, 3pm, 4pm, 5pm).

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Regards,
Grace
