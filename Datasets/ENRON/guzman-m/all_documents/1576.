Prices Suggest What ISO Pays - Source
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Monday day-ahead prices into the California Power
Exchange hit a state-mandated $250 per megawatt hour price cap for every
single hour, the first time that has happened in the history of the CalPX,
said a source close to the issue.
"Our on-peak prices are at the cap, our off-peak prices are at the cap, our
average price is at the cap," the source said.
The prices are in line with December balance-of-month forward prices in the
Mid Columbia River market electricity hub, which hit $525/MWh, and January
forward prices, which hit $475/MWh on Monday.
Prices in the CalPX, which operates the state's day-of, day-ahead and block
forward electricity market, are likely an indication of the prices the
Independent System Operator is paying to secure that out-of-state
generation, the CalPX source said.
The California ISO, which must ensure the state's grid reliability and
operates 75% of the state real-time market, declared a stage-one electrical
emergency Monday, meaning operating reserves were below 7%.
The ISO said 10,000 MW of power was off line, and issued a call to buy 3,000
MW out of state.
It is strange that the CalPX would hit an across-the-board cap in the
winter, as opposed to the traditional high-peak summer season, market
sources said. The ISO has had an unusual winter, however, having declared an
unprecedented five stage-two power emergencies in November due to a large
amount of generation off line for planned and unplanned maintenace.
