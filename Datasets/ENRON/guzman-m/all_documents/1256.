Group,
We recently have had new counterparties express in interest in doing business 
with us... The telephone numbers are as follows:

Enmax(City of Calgary)  1-403-268-2018
TransCanada       1-403-216-2905
Florida Power and Light 1-561-625-7100

The Canadian companies primarily deliver at the BC border(they are typically 
sourcing from the Alberta Power Pool), please be sure to agree to terms for 
this energy(firm, non-firm, trans-contingent, etc.), in the case of a cut.  
TransAlta will also source from the Power Pool at times(otherwise they use 
the Centrailia plant), please keep this in mind.
FPL has a geothermal plant in SP-15 and some wind generation(?) in NP-15.  
Typically they have 12 mws in SP and 31 mws in NP.  Their SC is currently the 
APX.  

And finally as the credit situations change, or if you have any doubts be 
sure to talk with Tracy or call the credit hotline (6-853-1803).  Remember 
that you may be able to use other counterparties to buy or sell when needed 
(ie.  SnoPUD will buy from POWX for us).

Good Luck.

Bill
