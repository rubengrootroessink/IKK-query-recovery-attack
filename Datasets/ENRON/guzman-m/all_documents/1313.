Guys,
Just a reminder, tonight (01/18/01)we have length in the EPE system at PV, 9 
mws for HE 23 and 4 mws for HE 24.  This mw total may be revised depending on 
ST-SW, but you will likely need to sell this energy.  Be on the look out for 
more emails(they would say 'final' amount if I need to change anything).
Please send me an email with the prices and the schedule.

Thanks.
Bill
