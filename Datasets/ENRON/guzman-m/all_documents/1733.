Hi Mark
?
How are you? 
?
I wanted to call you at home, but I am never really  sure when you are 
sleeping and I don't want to call and wake you up. I know that  you are busy 
at work but maybe you can call me when you have a free moment...in  between 
the stress.
?
I was wondering if you had any plans this week on  your "Friday" night? Which 
I think is Thursday or Wednesday...I'm not really  sure because it seems like 
you have worked a lot already this week.
?
Anyway, I'll get to the point. Would you like to  come over on Thursday and 
have dinner with me? I'll make something good. Val  will be at Jerry's so it 
would just be you and me.
?
Call me and let me know. 
?
Amy
