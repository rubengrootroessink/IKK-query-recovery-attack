I just wanted to remind everyone that ALL cuts are supposed to be noted in 
the Lotus Notes Database!!!!!!!  I cannot emphasize the importance of this 
enough.  Any schedule that we are involved in and the schedule changes from 
the preschedule should have a cut note.  This includes service deals, EPE 
deals, and EPMI deals.  

Make sure this gets done!!!
