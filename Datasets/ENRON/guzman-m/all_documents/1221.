Hey y'all!
Just wanted to send you the address of my new homepage. Right now it's
pretty slim-pickin's...but I plan to build it up and I'm sure that in about
a year it'll be bigger than YAHOO! But until I get those shares sold you'll
have to put up with a few ad banners popping up every so often. Well, just
check it out and tell me what you think!

Just click the link above, or copy it to your browser window...hope to hear
from ya...
