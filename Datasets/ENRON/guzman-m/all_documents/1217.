Dave Steiner will start his first day of employment in our office on Monday, 
February 5.  He is our new IT Manager (replacing Mike McClain) and will 
report to Dan Dietrich.  For the past seven years, Dave has been a manager in 
information technology departments with two different companies, and he is 
anxious to put his skills to work at Enron.  

Please join me in welcoming Dave Steiner to our office.
