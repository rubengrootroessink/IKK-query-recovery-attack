We have some new opportunities with Modesto Irrigation District in Northern 
California.  MID is their own schedule coordinator (SC id for caps -- MID1), 
and has a very flexible system that we can frequently help them run more 
efficiently.  MID has partial ownership in San Juan, and can buy in the SW at 
PV or Mead 230(some wheels to San Juan may be needed).  MID also has the 
capability to buy/sell in the SW or at Capt Jack in the NW and then buy/sell 
respectively with us in NP-15.  MID's real time # is 1-209-527-3185, the RT 
guys at MID are not marketers, they are system reliability folks(dispatchers 
like EPE--old school), be aware and prepared for this when talking to them.  
If we are going to make use of their system flexibility, we should set it up 
WELL ahead of time with Blair Jackson(209-526-7505) or Matt 
Ray(209-527-8001), it also would likely be helpful to reference these two 
when talking to the dispatchers.  

We have also had BPA build us some new account #'s that may help you.  They 
are as follows

#682608 Enron on the intertie and the network, CISO to SnoPUD, Captain Jack
