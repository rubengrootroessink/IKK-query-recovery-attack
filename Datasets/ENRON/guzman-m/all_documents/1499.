1528ESTNorthwest Pwr Sellers Want Cash First
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--The California Independent System Operator said
Wednesday that there was more than a 50% chance the state would have rolling
blackouts as early as 2:00 p.m. PST and possibly lasting through 7:00 p.m..
A dozen market participants in the Northwest have refused to sell emergency
power to the ISO unless it can pay in cash because of doubts about the ISO's
creditworthiness.
The ISO needs 4,000-5,000 megawatts of imports from the Northwest; it's
receiving virtually none, said ISO Chief Operating Officer Kellan Fluckiger.
