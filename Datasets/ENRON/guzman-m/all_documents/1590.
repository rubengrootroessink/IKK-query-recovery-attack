To raise money for our family we adopted for Christmas, we are having a bake 
sale at the filing cabinets by the Christmas tree ( in origination)  All 
goodies are $1.00 a piece.   This is going to be on the honor system, so help 
yourselves!!!

Supply is limited, but I heard that Jeff Richter made a mean cake w/cream 
cheese frosting.  You go, Jeff!!
