After re-creating an entire day's process, I finally figured out it was the 
Schedule Crawler causing the problem when downloading Finals for HE24.

The reason I could not re-create the problem before was that I tested with 
the latest code and not the Executable running in Production.

I've removed the "False Finals" from the Finals for 01/16 so this error 
should not cause any problems tomorrow morning.  

Please monitor Hour Ahead Finals for 01/17 tonight after the 01/16 HE24 
Finals are imported.  The "False Finals" should not appear.

I'm sorry for all of the confusion.  Thanks for you patience!

Pete

Pete,

Primarily it seems like if we submit an HA 24 schedule than the false finals 
show up.  But I believe we will just have to document closely when the finals 
carry over, as I have noticed them after I create a new customer id in a load 
zone but before I submit an HA 24 final.  SO...I guess I do not have an 
accurate answer.  I will try to get you as much information as I can, through 
talking with the group.

Thanks for your attention.

Bill
