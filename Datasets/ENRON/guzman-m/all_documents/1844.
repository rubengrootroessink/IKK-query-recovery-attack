I mentioned it to my family last night but nobody took me seriously.  I'm
not sure what kind of position and/or how much they would offer me.  Right
now I'm only making $29K a year and to live in CA I would think I would need
to make at LEAST $35K a year to meet the cost of living, etc.  I would also
ask for a signing bonus to go towards moving costs.  I am very serious about
moving there.  But it all depends on how good his offer is and what kind of
position it is.  I don't know where I would live - Their office is in
Beverly Hills and I know I couldn't afford to live there.  What do you
think?  As far as time frame, I'm thinking February.  That would allow me to
get through the Hollidays and break my lease.  I'm not sure what Dave's
reaction would be.  Things have been going really good lately and he's been
opening himself up a lot more towards me.  For example, he won't tell me he
loves me and that's fine.  But the other night when he thought I was
sleeping, he kissed me on the forehead and whispered it to me.  Yeah.  So
again, I don't know.  I'm sure he'll be dissapointed but I think he will
understand.  He's not the type to say, "No, don't go!  I love you and I want
you to stay!"  Even if it was how he felt.
What about you?  When do you think you'll make your move?

So, you are really serious about this then huh?  I thought you were just
thinking about it.  So where were you thinking of living? Have you
discussed it with your family.  How much would they have to offer you in
order for you to move and what kind of time frame are you thinking about.
What do you think daves reaction will be?
