I am pleased to announce that Jim Reyes has joined the Volume Management 
group.   

Jim comes to us from the Finance Group at EBS here in Portland.  He will be 
spending the next few weeks rotating throught each of the VM  chairs 
and familiarizing himself with the responsibilities of those positions.

Please take a moment to stop by and welcome Jim to Enron North America.

Thanks,

Murray O'Neil
