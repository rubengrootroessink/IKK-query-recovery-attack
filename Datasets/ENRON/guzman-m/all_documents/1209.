Guys,

I had quite a bitter experience on Saturday with EPE schedules and I am 
sharing it with you so that you know what to do if it happens to you.

The dispatchers called saying that SRP was not checking out and that EPE was 
supposed to send to SRP 100 MW on a prescheduled basis. I had SRP fax me the 
tags and in the meantime I cut some of my econ sales to allow some room for 
this 100Mw to SRP. The tags  looked accurate except  for one little detail 
that I missed which made all the difference.  This schedule was actually a 
generation exchange between EPE and TEP where TEP was sending these MWs to 
SRP.

To be able to tell this tag from a regular one look at the column titled Ref 
which says GF-EX which means gen exch. If you come across a tag that says 
GF-EX 
 DO NOT accept the tag. Be sure first before you go in and cut you econ 
sales. This has happened a couple of times lately and hopefully this will 
help.

If this is not clear to you let me know and I will explain it further,


Thanks,
Monika
