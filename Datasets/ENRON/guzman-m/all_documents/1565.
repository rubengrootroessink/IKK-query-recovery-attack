Night shift:
Please purchase from El Paso the following at Palo:

HE 23 MST - 8 mw's
HE 24 MST - 11 mw's

Pay market price and send this energy to APS  at PV.    Explain to APS RT 
that this is for line loss payback.

Show this in the EPE model as a sale to Enron at market price.   Footnote 
that this is going to APS for line losses.

This has been cleared by Tony at EPE.    If you have any questions tonight,  
call me on my cell phone.


Thanks!
