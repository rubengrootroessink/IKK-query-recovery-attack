Guz,

Here are some details about the winnebago.  It would be great to keep this
thing in the family.  It would be sad to see it go away to someone else and
not be able to party in it anymore.  It would make me very happy to see this
go to a friend!

1983 Winnebago Brave, 23 foot class A
* Purchased Feb 1999, we are the 2nd owner. It was previously in
Arizona for many many years.
* Brakes, tires, exhaust, and suspension were replaced/upgraded.
* Engine has been replaced with a 1999 Chevy 454, bought brand new and
professionally installed by Carr Chevrolet at a cost of $4,500.  Has a
50,000 mile warranty.  There are only 6,000 miles on this engine.
* The upholstery has been updated.
* Floorboards have been replaced and reinforced.
* Carpet was replaced with commercial grade carpeting made for hotels.
* Refrigerator and stove are only a few years old.
* It has been driven only about 75,000 miles in its entire life.

That is the major stuff.  It will sleep 5 people comfortably, more
uncomfortably.  It will ride with 7 comfortably and accommodate 10 easily.
Gas mileage is about 8, loaded or unloaded.  It is equipped for towing and
can easily tow boats. Insurance is dirt cheap at about $15-$20 per month.

Kevin and I have spent somewhere between $11 and 12 thousand on it, but we
are trying to sell it for $9,000.  Most RV's that are under $10k are pieces
of crap. This one is in great physical and mechanical shape.  Kevin and I
know this thing inside and out and can fix nearly anything on it.  It is
definitely a good deal at $9k. I know there is nothing nicer out there at
this price.

Ben
