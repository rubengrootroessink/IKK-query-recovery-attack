Group,
Two quick things...

First- from volume management:
When scheduling a service customer such as Harbor or WheelabratorShasta, 
Arco, Tosco, etc. we need to be sure to schedule using the customer ID in 
CAPS.  Otherwise RT has no generation and we are considered short (please see 
myself or Kourtney with questions).


Second- from the preschedulers:
If we sit at Lisa or Stacy's desk, please be sure to log out of the computer 
and their phone.   Their computers are not necessarily for Real-Time use,  
but I would like to be sure that we can continue to use these computers at 
night.  If they aren't happy with the cleanliness of their desk, or with 
having to reset their computers each morning, etc...we will probably lose 
this priviledge.

Other than that, 

Keep up the good work.

Thanks,
Bill
