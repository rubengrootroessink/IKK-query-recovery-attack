AZPS is infamous for changing their requirements on tags.  So is SRP.  Just 
do what you need to do to get your tags implemented.  Until the standards are 
published, the Control Areas are god.

Becky at APS turned down a tag for me last night for HE 4MST that we have 
been using for several weeks without a problem.  The tag number is 18594.  
Tis was a sale from EPE to PNM at 4C.  She turned it down saying that EPE is 
not a control area at 4C and that PNM should be in the CA for the first 
line.  I argued with her about it for quite a while but she insisted that it 
was wrong.  Could you please take a look at this and tell me if she is wrong. 
Thank you.
