hey mark,
how about them beavs!!!     I suppose that surpassed even your
expectations.     It was definitely fun to watch them wax ND.
Karen and I spent New Years in Palm Desert with a few friends that have a
home right on the golf course.   I played a round, but did not shoot as
well as I did when I played with you.   Shot a 104..... but was still
pleased and had fun.

As I told you last week, I will be going to Seattle for business and will
be staying with Jorge on Saturday and Sunday nights.   I arrive at Seatac
at 1pm on Saturday.      Just wondering if you decided to drive up for the
weekend also.       Let me know either way.     If not, then we'll catch
you in a couple months.

love ya,
dave
