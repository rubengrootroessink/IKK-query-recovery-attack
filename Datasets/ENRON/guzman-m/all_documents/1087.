As was handed out in the RT meeting............

I have a new fun one for all of you..............  the correct (in theory!) 
POD/POR E-Tag acronyms for the entire WSCC.  The attached sheet has the 
entire list as well as a short list that I have created. The short list 
contains most of the points that we use in RT.  Get to know them well.  Enjoy!

Cheers,
Jesse
