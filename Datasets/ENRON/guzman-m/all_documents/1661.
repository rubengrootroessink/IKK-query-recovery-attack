The Mortician's Tale

A Portland area mortician had a new apprentice who was learning the
embalming ropes.  He walked into the embalming room where a cadaver was
lying on the table. Thinking he knew enough now to begin the procedure
without his boss, he began examining the body.  He rolled it over and to his

amazement, there was a cork in its rear end.  Mystified, he pulled it out,
and immediately heard the University of Oregon fight song come out the
cadaver's butt.

Startled by what had happened, he shoved the cork back into the cadaver and
ran up the stairs to find his mentor.  "Sir, you've got to come down and
help me! I've just seen something I can't believe", he cried.  Annoyed by
the naivet, of his assistant, he followed him downstairs.  "There! Look at
the cork in the ass of that body", said the assistant.  "I couldn't imagine
what it was doing there so I pulled it out.  Please, you do it."  The
mortician was a bit surprised to see the cork too, so he walked to the table

and removed the cork.  Once again, the University of Oregon fight song
started playing.  Exasperated, he replaced the cork in its appointed
position, turned to his assistant and said:  "What's so surprising about
that? I've heard thousands of assholes sing that song."
