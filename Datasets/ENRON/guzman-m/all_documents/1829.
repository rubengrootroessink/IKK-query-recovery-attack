You're so right about the Dave deal.  Not sure what I'm going to do.  We
communicate pretty well so maybe I'll just talk to him about it.
That's is so sad about Angela.  I know you mut be feeling so bad about not
being with her but she understands that you can't right now.  She has got
your Mom and Danno and Jay - She'll be ok.

Letting him stir is good in some ways but guys actually tend to like a lack
of clarity in relationships as it gives them more leeway.  However, I don't
really know the dynamic in your relationship at all.

So Angela and I made up from our huge saturday morning fight before I left
on Sunday and she cried like a baby when i left.  I feel so bad leaving
her. She is really broken hearted right now.
