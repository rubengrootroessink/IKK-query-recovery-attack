Guys,

Just wanted to confirm, you are LONG at Palo Verde, this is El Paso electric 
energy.  You are long 4 mw for HE 23 PST, and 9 mwh for HE 24 PST.  PLEASE 
sell this energy off (MWD should be buying if you want to take it to Mead 
230--remember that SRP charges based on CALPX SP-15 MCP for losses).  We also 
have 6 mwhs for HE 1-6 at PV coming from EPE, and 18 mwhs for HE 23 and 24 
coming from EPE.  You only need to make the sell side of this deal, the sell 
side needs to be under ST-SW book, they will make an annuity for the money 
that they owe us.  We are doing a profit share with these extra mws, today we 
made $15,500 for remarketing these scraps, we will have these extras for the 
next couple days.  These guys appreciate our service and our paying us well 
for the help...

And on another note...please update the El Paso reconcilliation sheet...

Thanks for the hard work.

Bill
