03:25 PM Traders Allegedly `Fixed' Power Prices
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Energy marketing and trading companies that conduct
business in California were named in a lawsuit filed in San Diego Superior
Court Wednesday alleging traders "fixed" wholesale power prices and
conspired with other companies to raise the "market clearing bid" for energy
sold into the state's Power Exchange, resulting in more than $1 billion in
electricity overcharges last summer.
The complaint names as defendants PG&E Energy Trading, a unit of PG&E Corp.
(PCG), Dynegy Power Marketing Inc. (DYN), Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc.,
Enron Energy Services and Enron Power Marketing Inc (ENE), Reliant Energy
Services, a unit of Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) Sempra Energy Trading and
Sempra Energy Resoures, a unit of Sempra Energy Inc. (SRE) Southern Company
Energy Marketing (SO), Williams Energy Marketing and Trading and Williams
Energy Services Co., Duke Energy Trading and Marketing LLC (DUK) and NRG
Energy (NRG).
The complaint, filed on behalf of sole plaintiff Ruth Hendricks pending
class action status by a judge, alleges the companies "anticompetitive
conduct included combining to restrain the amount of energy available
through the (CalPX) and ISO energy markets, conspiring to illegally obtain
and trade information relating to energy supply, pricing and demand, and
combining to raise the market clearing bid for electric energy on the CalPX
wholesale markets."

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Early prediction reports from the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration indicate California has a 73%-83% chance of
above normal temperatures next summer, while the entire Western U.S. has a
78% chance of above normal temps.
A NOAA spokesman said early reports, which have a 60% probability, indicate
El Nino or La Nina effects could result in an unusually hot summer for
California between the months of July, August and September.
Normal temperature conditions for the summer of 2001 is a 23.3% to 13.3%
possibility and below normal is 3.3%.
A hotter than normal summer could also have a devastating impact on the
state's electricity resources, creating shortages that could lead to rolling
blackouts, according to the state's Independent System Operator.
