Hey Guys.

Be cautious when doing a NP/MALIN BR even when the person has Grand-fathered 
rights at the tie. Sunday morning the ISO cut my sale to DYNEGY as well as my 
purchase from SCEM so that my schedule would not flow. They do this as they 
cannot cut the GF transmission. As soon as someone schedules on the GF rights 
they get a call from the ISO asking about the transaction, they can then act 
accordingly to avoid the export to happen. They hacked my entire 100MW on 
Sunday morning for some hours.

So if you try this deal in the next couple of days, do it in a moderate size. 
Dynegy will also maybe a little hesitant to do much more than 25MW until this 
issue is solved.
