so that no possiblity for a discrepancy exists.

US DOE Extends Calif Pwr Emergency Order Through Jan. 10

(This article was originally published Friday) 

   
WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The U.S. Department of Energy has extended through 
Jan. 10 an emergency order requiring power producers to supply California's 
troubled electricity market.
But the latest extension of DOE's seldom-used emergency authority imposes two 
new significant conditions on the mandatory power sales. 

First, DOE is requiring California to certify within a week's time that it 
has taken steps to reduce electricity demand by 5% during periods of peak 
demand. 

In addition, the order requires that any negotiated power prices above $64 
per megawatt-hour be submitted to the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission for review to assure the sales price is "just and reasonable." 

The latter provision appears aimed at addressing the above-market prices 
sellers are requiring as a risk premium given credit concerns surrounding the 
state's financially troubled utilities. 

The Federal Power Act, as amended by Congress in the 1970s, gives the 
secretary of energy broad authority to order power sales in the event of war 
or any emergency that threatens "a shortage of electric energy." 

Energy Secretary Bill Richardson first invoked the seldom-used emergency 
authority Dec. 14, as power producers and marketers balked at supplying 
electricity to California unless they received credit guarantees. 

The order was seen as helping the state avert imminent rolling blackouts in 
the face of tight power supplies and skyrocketing prices, which have sent 
California utilities to the brink of insolvency. 

The order requires all power producers and marketers who supplied power to 
California in the 30 days prior to the Dec. 14 order to deliver any 
uncommitted power when the California Independent System Operator declares 
its electricity supply inadequate. 

The original order provided that, in the event the ISO and power providers 
can't agree on a price, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission would 
determine "a just and reasonable rate" for the mandated power sales. 

The revised order means that FERC will now determine the justness and 
reasonableness of virtually all contracts entered into under the emergency 
order. 

Friday's action marked the fourth time DOE has extended the order. Last 
month, when the order was extended through Jan. 5, Richardson said: "It is my 
sincere hope that further action under my emergency powers will be 
unnecessary." 

Richardson said Friday that he hoped last month's extension would be the 
last, but that circumstances dictate the state be given additional time to 
adjust the problem.
