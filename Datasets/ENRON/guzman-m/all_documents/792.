I found a way two new ways we can wheel small quantities of power from the 
South to the north through Sierra Pacific. The downside is that it is very 
time consuming and we can only do small amounts, but now that Malin is 
quieting down, we need to look at other opportunities. Anyway here are the 
two new paths.

The First PATH IS THROUGH GONDER:

1. From MEAD230 Wheel it to RED BUTTE using Nevada Power Transmission (COST 
$2.90). 
2. From RED BUTTE wheel it to GONDER Using PAC Transmission (COST $5.84) 
3. From GONDER wheel it to NORTH VALMY Using SPP Transmission (COST $6.90) 
4. From NORTH VALMY wheel it to IPC-SYS Using IPC Transmission (COST $0)
5. From IPC-SYS wheel it to LOLO Using IPC Transmission (COST $2.38)
From Lolo do a BR with WWPC to their system or wherever you want it.

These are all on-peak prices, did not have time to look up the off-peak. But 
it will of course be less. 

There are a lot of constraints on this path. The most significant is GONDER 
to NORTH VALMY. There are only small quantities available at certain times. 
The other significant constraint is NORTH VALMY TO IPC-SYS.

Could also wheel it to Hotsprings from IPC - Sys.


There is a TAG TEMPLATE OUT THERE FOR THIS DEAL.


SECOND PATH:

The second way is to export out of the ISO at Silverpeak. There is normally 
five MW's of Room there and SPP can pick it up at control and take it to 
NORTH VALMY. From there do like above. This is an untested strategy so be 
careful.

Like I said, there are only small quantities of this trannie available, but I 
think it is worth a shot.
