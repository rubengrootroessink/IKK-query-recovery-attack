Hey Mark!
Here is (FINALLY) the long awaited...true you probably
weren't dying for it.. but here we are anyway- I'm
emailing you! So hows life in Oregon? things are doing
okay here. had kind of crazy/crappy weekend, but it
happens. Anyway-I'm hoping will be able to get
together this week while you are in town. Of course I
have work wed- sun- the whole time your here, but I
was going to try to see if I could get either wed,
thurs, or sunday off if it works for you and we can
hang. Unfortunately I wasn't able to email you until
now and the week came too quick so it is hard to plan
much, but if your busy I totally understand and I just
hope will be able to hook up for a bit. If one day is
better than the other email me or give me a call. I'll
just search on my end to see if I can get any of them
covered. I hope everythings going okay on your end. I
miss you and can't waitto see you. Talk soon. And lets
try to get these emails going.
Lots of love,
Lisa
