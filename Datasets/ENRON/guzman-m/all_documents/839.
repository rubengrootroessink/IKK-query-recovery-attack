Subject: Deal Changes - Add Comments

Melissa Murphy would like us to begin adding a note in the comments section 
of all the deals we change. I know most of you already do this when you make 
big changes to deals, but she'd like to see more comments more often. Of 
course this mostly applies to me, but I thought I'd pass it along just in 
case. See the attached e-mail, and let me know if you have questions.

Thanks,
Kate

Subject: Hello

Hi, I was wondering if it would too time consuming for you to add a note in 
the comments box inside deal entry when you change a deal.  We always try to 
put a note in the comments box so it is easier to research what has changed 
on a trade in the future.  If you could add notes it would help us out when 
we are researching past deals.  Let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Melissa
