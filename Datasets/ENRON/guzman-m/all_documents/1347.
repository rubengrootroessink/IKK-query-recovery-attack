Hey Mark
below is a summary of the costs I paid for Bill's funeral and credit card
costs.

Mariachis             260
Price Club            370
Arturo food           240
chair rental              80

Household CC   600     paid in November
Household  CC   146    paid Dec. 26th
Mervyns bill        1420    total of January statement
Macy's bill           1050    total of January statement
Total                    $4,166

I'll go ahead and pay the Mervyns and Macy's bill as soon as I receive your
check and since I just got their statements.   I'd like to avoid paying
them 18% interest as long as you have the cash.     I have not received a
bill from the funeral home, nor have I paid them anything.   I can't
remember if you gave them my address or your mom's.

FYI,  I've received two voice mails from bill collectors regarding Cito's
old Broadway credit card (I think they are now Bloomingdale's).     I have
not replied to their voice mails and do not know how they received my phone
number.   But I'll ignore them for now since they are trying to hunt down
Salvador Guzman, who died 18 years ago anyway.     They will probably give
up trying to collect, but just thought I'd let you know about that pending
liability.    Do you know how much Bill owed them?

In case you don't have my address, it is
     7971 Southwind Circle
     HB   92648

see ya,
Dave
