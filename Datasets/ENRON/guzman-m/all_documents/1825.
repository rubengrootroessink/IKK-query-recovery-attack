The group has been doing a great job with deal entry - with a few 
exceptions.  I just want to go over a some basics:

Make sure your price index is appropriate for the delivery point.  If you 
enter a delivery point of Malin, Capt Jack, or COB, your price index should 
reference NW1,  not NW3, NW2, etc.   If it's a Day-Of (Hour-Ahead) deal, make 
sure the price index reflects that, i.e., it has the "HA" in the index.

If the deal is such that the PX is doing the import/export for us (title to 
the power changes hands at a tie point, versus in a load zone such as NP, SP 
or ZP), the counterparty should be California Power Exchange - Scheduling 
Coordinator (CalPX-SC).  This lets people know EPMI is not the 
importer/exporter of the power - the PX is responsible for that.  

If you buy/sell from/to the PX @ NP, SP or ZP, the counterparty is simply 
California Power Exchange (CalPX).  

If the deal is due to a real-time cut, the counterparty is California PX - 
Time Removal.  The price should an ISO-based index and it should always be 
either ISOHANP15inc/dec, or ISOHASP15inc/dec.  Currently there are some 
messages (in Deal Entry and Deal Blotter) tied to the Time-Removal 
counterparty that indicate the price should be either ISOHANP15 or ISOSP15 
(without the Inc/Dec ).  For now, ignore that message and make sure the index 
included Inc/Dec.  When IT releases a new version of Deal Entry and Deal 
Blotter, we'll be able to better manage these "checks".  Also, even though 
the index should be based on the ISO for these types of deals, the delivery 
point should still be the actual delivery point, such as PV, 4C, etc.  

It's important these deals are entered correctly.  If they're not, the P/L 
that is reported to mgt is incorrect - and it will be until I come thru to 
settle.  

Thanks.

Brett
