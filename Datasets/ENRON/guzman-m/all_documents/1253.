Mark-

Please look at deal # 474762 APS for a total of 19 MWh (8+11MWh) HE 23-24. I 
have found this deal in EnPower and in ETS and on the El Paso model.  The 
outstanding question is was the price $210, $200 or $250?  El Paso has it at 
$250, the El Paso written log has it as $210 and EnPower has it at $200.  The 
counterparty isn't even showing it.  

HELP!

Thanks,

Virginia
