As some of you may have heard, Jesse Bryson will be heading up our effort on 
real-time tagging with the assistance of Cara Semperger.  To better 
facilitate our effort on tagging and to improve coordination with 
settlements, Jesse will be moving to days beginning January 10th.  
As a result of Jesse leaving the rotation, we will have an opening for shift 
work in the group.  If you are aware of someone that you feel might be a good 
fit in the real-time group, please pass their resume onto Greg Wolfe, Amy 
FitzPatrick or myself, and we will take a look at them.

Thank you,

Bill
