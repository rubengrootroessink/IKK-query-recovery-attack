 MANTRA FOR LIVING

   This is what The Dalai Lama has to say on the
   millennium, which begins 01/01/2001.
   All it takes is a few seconds to read and think about.

   Do not keep this message. The mantra must leave
   your hands within 96 hours.

   You will get a very pleasant surprise. This is
   true even if you are not superstitious.

   Instructions for life in the new millennium from
   the Dalai Lama:

   1. Take into account that great love and great
   achievements involve great risk.

   2. When you lose, don't lose the lesson.

   3. Follow the three Rs: Respect for self, respect
   for others, responsibility for all your actions.

   4. Remember that not getting what you want is
   sometimes a wonderful stroke of luck.

   5. Learn the rules so you know how to break them
   properly.

   6. Don't let a little dispute injure a great
   friendship.

   7. When you realize you've made a mistake, take
   immediate steps to correct it.

   8. Spend some time alone every day.

   9. Open your arms to change, but don't let go of
   your values.

   10. Remember that silence is sometimes the best
   answer.

   11. Live a good, honorable life. Then when you get
   older and think back, you'll be able to enjoy it a second time.

   12. A loving atmosphere in your home is the
   foundation for your life.

   13. In disagreements with loved ones, deal only
   with the current situation. Don't bring up the past.

   14. Share your knowledge. It's a way to achieve
  immortality.

   15. Be gentle with the earth.

   16. Once a year, go someplace you've never been
   before.

   17. Remember that the best relationship is one in
   which your love for each
   other exceeds your need for each other.

   18. Judge your success by what you had to give up
   in order to get it.

   19. Approach love and cooking with reckless
   abandon.

   Do not keep this message. The mantra must leave
   your hands within 96 hours.

   You will get a very pleasant surprise (this is
   true even if you are not superstitious)
   if you send it to:

  0-4 people: Your life will improve slightly.

   5-9 people: Your life will improve to your liking.

   9-14 people: You will have at least 5 surprises in
   the next 3 weeks.

   15 people and above: Your life will improve
   drastically and everything you
   ever dreamed of will begin to take shape
