Hi Mark,

Got your message.? I checked Cita's phone after you called and she answered 
it ok.? I'm thinking that maybe you dialed the wrong number.? Her number is 
(714) 778-4007.? Sometimes I dial 788 instead of 778!!? It must be my age, 
but then again you're getting old in more ways than one!!? Anyway, I told 
Cita that you tried calling her and she said that she might have been in the 
bathroom.? Plus, she was very happy that you tried calling her.? She is such 
a baby and we all spoil her - and I'm sure we all love doing it too.? 

Looking forward to seeing you when you get into town.? It's too bad it's a 
little hectic right now for me otherwise "I" would've dragged you to Vegas 
since your friends bailed out.? I am way over due to go to Vegas just to 
enjoy myself instead of only going when I have to go for a trade show or 
convention.? Maybe someday we can do that - okay?

See ya when your in town - love ya way too much (dickwad!) Uncle Bob
