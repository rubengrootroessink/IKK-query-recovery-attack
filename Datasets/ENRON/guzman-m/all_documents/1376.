The Networking team will be testing the connection again this evening 
starting at 7:30 PM.  There is a slight possibility that they will need to 
continue the testing over the weekend as well.  If you have any questions or 
concerns please feel free to contact me or Chip Cox.

Thank you for your patience.

Diana
