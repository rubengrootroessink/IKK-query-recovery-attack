This unit is down all weekend and Monday.  Take this out of CAPS for these 
hours.

Thanks,
Holden


Also, Chris Foster would like us to monitor the schedule crawler for all the 
generators on an hourly basis.  If the ISO cuts the generation please call 
the generators so they can ramp down and avoid the Dec.  Your help with this 
is appreciated.
