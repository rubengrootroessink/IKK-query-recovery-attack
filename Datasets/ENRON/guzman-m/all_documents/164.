We are playing at the same location (directions are below) and at the same 
time (7 pm).  We need to have all the ladies show up or we forfeit. Look 
forward to playing on Thursday.

Paul -

CSC is short for "Child Services Center".  It is what used to be Washington
High School.  The adress is SE 14th and Stark.  The gym is south of Stark,
between Stark and Morrison.

Mike,

Can I get the directions or address to tomorrow's match for the Fractals, I
think it is at 7pm in the csc 1.  Also thanks for being flexible in
changing our schedule.

Regards,

Paul
