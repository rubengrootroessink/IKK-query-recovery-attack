     Brett -

     Currently, your masterfile has active SC Transfer resources at NP and SP
for routine SC transfers in and out as well
     as AS SC transfers.

     For each SC transfer resource function, you are limited to one set of
resources.

     With this being the case, I cannot register additional SC transfer
resources.

     Please call me with any questions,

     Best Regards,
     Steven Sweet

Subject:  Resource IDs


Morning Steven,

Will you please add four new resource IDs to the PX database for EPMI?
They are:
EPMIRTNP15IN
EPMIRTNP15OUT
EPMIRTSP15IN
EPMIRTSP15OUT

Please inform me of the Global IDs that will be assigned to these
resources.  As always, don't hesitate to call/email with questions.
503.464.8298.  Thanks for your help.

Regards,

Brett
