If you are interested in learning more about the bonus deferral choices or 
have specific questions regarding the deferral plan, please join us in the 
Video Conference room on Monday, 12/4 from 10:00 am - 11:00 am or from 2:00 
pm - 3:00 pm.   We will be video conferencing with our Compensation team in 
Houston to  provide an overview of the deferral choices as well as answer 
your questions.

Please let Teri Whitcomb know if you will be attending as space is limited.

Thanks!
