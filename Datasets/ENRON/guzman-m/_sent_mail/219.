Well I bet your family just feels like I was saying the other night.  That 
you are to close with them to actually move.  I wish you luck and hopefully 
you get a good offer but i would definetly think about needing more than just 
$35,000 to live in LA. I would think the absolute minimum you should take 
would be $40,000 to $45,000 plus moving costs and siging bonus.  He has been 
persuing you for over a year so it appears he is pretty desperate for you 
services.  In LA to get someone for that cheap is really a bargain.  You have 
got to realize it s really expensive to live there.  Especially if your 
office is in Beverly Hills.  You kind of have two options.  You could live in 
the Valley for cheaper.  But in my opinion the Valley sucks. I would never 
ever ever live in the valley.   Or you could find somewhere in like North 
Hollywood or maybe Redondo Beach.  Lisa lives there (north Hollywood)  and 
pays about $900 a month for a one bedroom apartment.  Which is very 
reasonable for LA.  Maybe Danny has some connections.   So I am curious, if 
Dave was to say I love you and don't go would you stay?
