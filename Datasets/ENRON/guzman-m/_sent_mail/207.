Letting him stir is good in some ways but guys actually tend to like a lack 
of clarity in relationships as it gives them more leeway.  However, I don't 
really know the dynamic in your relationship at all.  

So Angela and I made up from our huge saturday morning fight before I left on 
Sunday and she cried like a baby when i left.  I feel so bad leaving her. She 
is really broken hearted right now.
