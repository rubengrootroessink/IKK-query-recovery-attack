Hey Dave.  Hope your weekend went well with the girls.  I got a call from my 
mom tonight that Cita was in the Hospital again.  According to my mom she is 
doing okay now.  I called Cita on Friday and she said she just felt like she 
was getting a cold but apparently she went in for the heart failure thing 
again?  Is that correct.?  Anyway,  I am working the night shift tonight so I 
will give her a call tommorow afternoon after I wake up.   I called and left 
you a message letting you know that i am probably not going to Vegas.  
Everyone kind of flaked out.  So, I will be around the weekend of the Super 
Bowl and was wondering what you guys might be doing for it.  Also I was going 
to see if you and Karen would maybe be interested in going up to Big Bear to 
go skiing for the day on Friday or Saturday.  I thought it might be fun.  I 
have an extra set of ski's that I was thinking about bringing and leaving  
down there anyway so I could go without having to hassle with Rentals.  So, 
let me know if you have any interest in doing that and if you have anything 
going for the Super Bowl.  Tell Cita I love her and tell Bob to get in 
shape!  See ya soon!
