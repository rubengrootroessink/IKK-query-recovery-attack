  Thanks for being so nice about me venting.  I actually tried to call you 
but you were porbably in bed.  So I just went to the store grabbed as six 
pack had a few beers and sat at my computer for until about 3 am.  I was 
really having an enmotional night last night.  I think I just hadn't let go 
of my feelings and it all just came out in one night.  It is funny but the 
next morning I got calls from both Price Strader and Kim Kirkwood to see how 
I was doing.  Did I ever tell you the story about Kim and I at Wilsons 
wedding?    If not I should tell you it is really funny.  Anyway as far as 
watching the game I would love to watch it with you but I have tickets.  
Benny,  Burns, and a bunch of us are taking Benny's Winnebago down there and 
partying.  What sucks though is I have a night shift so basically I will be 
going down there on no sleep.  Regarding Beaches, I would love to do that 
also but, I am leaving on Sunday for LA and won't be back until the day after 
thanksgiving.  So, i guess i will just give you a call or something when I 
get back.  I thought that you would be watching the game with Dave.  Did 
something happen and you guys get in a fight again or something?
