So, I saw Kristen last night.  I was on my way to dinner with my friend Kim 
and Kristen was sitting outside at the 21st ave Bar and Grill.  She acted 
like I was her long lost friend and then proceeded to ask about the night in 
Long Beach.  She said hey, I have no hard feelings over what happended to 
which I didn't respond and then she said "what happened that night?"  "All i 
really remember was Katie throwing a chair at me"  I said " I don't want to 
talk about it Kristen"  and we walked off.  My friend Kim thought I was being 
very rude.   She asked me why I was so rude to someone that appeared to be so 
nice.  So I had to tell the whole story over dinner.  I was once again 
completely shocked.  All I could do was laugh.
