Yeah dude I bet you got a lot of operational management and statistical 
business analysis as well as spreadsheet work with that Poli Sci degree.  At 
least the group projects will enable you to meet some people.  Are you still 
thinking about getting a job tending bar or something or do you think you 
won't have enough time?  good to hear you are coming up in a few weeks.  I 
would definetly like to go out with you guys on Thursday night. That Friday 
night i already have plans but maybe we can go play some golf on Friday 
afternoon.  I played in a tournament with some people at work out at the 
Reserve last week.  Boy is that a great course.  Our tee time was at 7:30 and 
we had all been out partying until 2am the night before.  So needless to say 
we weren't feeling so great come tee time. However the beers were free for 
the tournament and come about 7:45 we were drinking again and feeling a 
little better.  We all played really well and got fourth plance out of 42 
teams.  We won these sweater vests, a sand wedge, and a Nike bag.  There was 
a free bar-b-que afterward with more free beer.  So by about 2pm we were all 
totally schmatered.  It was a good time and I was playing with the guy that i 
want to work for in Real Time Trading.  He and I are going to lunch next week 
to discuss but he mentioned to me during golf that he wants me to work for 
him which would be a great opportunity so things are going a little better at 
work.  Anwyay let me know what your plans are for the week you come.  I will 
catch you later man.
