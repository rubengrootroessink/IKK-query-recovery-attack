Bill, during HE 17  IID had a 130 MW  Firm in the scrape and in the model.  
When checking out with IID they stated they had 120 MW only.  In speaking 
with Joe at  IID they stated that  they spoke with Tony at 14:13 PST and told 
him to put in 120 for HE 17 and 18 MST.  I agreed to check out with their 
number as it appears that there was a miscommunication between IID, Tony,  
and David (who was working during that shift).  You may want to ask Tony when 
he comes in if he recalls this conversation.  Thank you for your attention to 
this matter.
