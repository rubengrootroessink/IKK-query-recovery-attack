Bill,  I have some family business that I need to attend to in April.  I 
therefore need, March 31st thru April 3rd off from work.  It is only four 
days so I assume it will not be a problem.  I already have March 31st off so 
if you could just make sure that I have April 1st  thru 3rd off also it would 
be greatly appreciated.  I am going to book my ticket tommorow evening to 
take advantage of a good fare so please let me know if there is a problem by 
then.  Thanks.
