Bill, over the past few weeks we have had quite a few occasions that El Paso 
has had problems checking out with other control areas due to them providing 
transmission for other counter parties.  Last night and on several other 
nights the generation guys at El Paso have been netting out generation 
schedules with transmission schedules.  On several occasions,including last 
night,  myself or other members of team have identified this problem for them 
and have told them not too net the schedules.  However, last night, and on 
other nights,  for several hours we were 15MW off because they netted a 
schedule.  Bert, I and other group members have tried to assist them with 
this issue however, it is becoming a consistent problem and i feel that 
someone may want to mention it to Roger, Steve, or Tony.   I have tried to 
address this with generation myself on several occassions however, the 
problem has become reoccuring.n  Thank you for your attention to this matter.
