Yeah she is a freak. She totally acted like I was her best friend or 
something!  give me a break if I wasn't with someone I would have totally 
went off on her.  I actually didn't watch the game as i was at the OSU game. 
We went to the peacock and drank some beers with Carter (who owns it now)  We 
partied most of the morning and then went to the game.  Then a bunch of us 
went down to Eugene and partied and i stayed the night at Wilson and Cindys.  
Deidre and Stephan were there too.  It was really fun.  Sunday sucked cause i 
was really hung over and had to be up to portland by noon to play golf with 
kim but a few beers on the course and I felt great.  Speaking of you picking 
up on chicks Amanda told me a pretty interesting story last week of you 
trying to pick up on her a couple of times.  So lets see, do I have any 
friends (male or female) that you didn't try to pick up on while we were 
dating! :)    Frankly I was very  embarassed when she told me. VERY NICE 
Katie!   Good thing Dave is a good sport.  I did see the articles about 
capital consultants.  Grayson  is lucky he isn't wearing a set of cement 
sneakers on the bottom of the Willamete for screwing around with union money 
like that!  That is too bad you dont hang out with your friends anymore.  How 
come you havent kept in touch?  Why dont you call them.
