Hey chica que pasa?  I am bored and its 2 in the freaking morning and I am 
sick and this really sucks.  Anyway this wasn't a mail to complain.   I 
wanted to know if you were still having your party on Saturday,  if I was 
still invited, if I could bring anything, and how to get to your house.  Well 
hope your day goes well.  One more night shift to go and then 5 days off for 
me!
