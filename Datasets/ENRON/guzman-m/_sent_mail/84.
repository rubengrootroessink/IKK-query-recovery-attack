hey you.! yeah, sorry about the late night call.  Jay, TJ, Scott, Chrissy, 
and Nicole and I were out pretty late that night and then came back to my 
house for a hot tub. We got really drunk becuase earlier in the night Scott 
got his Porsche impounded for basically no reason and we were bummed becasue 
we were on our way to this really cool club.  Well anyway, Jay was asking me 
how you were doing and I was drunk so I gave you a call.  Vegas was 
absolutely out of control!  We all decided on the way home that it was by far 
the craziest Vegas weekend any of us had ever been on.  It ended up being me, 
Jay, TJ, and Brendan.  Jimmy and Kato didn't come.  Anyway, TJ's girlfriend 
Jessica and some of her friends came out on Saturday.  We all went out to a 
nice dinner then gambled for a while and then went to some dance club where 
we proceeded to get in two fights because some dudes were hitting on 
Jessica.  We got kicked out of the club at the Luxor.   TJ got hit pretty bad 
and ended up with a black eye, Jay got his tooth chiped and I got sucker 
punched on the side of my head by some guy that was smaller than Jay.  And 
that was the mellow part of the evening.! It got even crazier after that as 
TJ, Jessica , Alisha, and I ended up staying up until 6am.  Then we went and 
hung out in their room at the Luxor for a couple hours. then went back 
downstairs and started partying again!  Meanwhile we couldn't find Jay and 
Brendan anywhere and we were really worried that they might be in Jail.  
Finally they called us at around 8am from some strip club. Anyway,  I have a 
ton more stories but this mail is getting too long.  How has everything been 
with you? Fill me in.  Oh,  I was going to buy a new TV anyway, so I was 
thinking why, don't we just trade our TV's back and you can use the $$$ to 
buy yourself a VCR or something.
