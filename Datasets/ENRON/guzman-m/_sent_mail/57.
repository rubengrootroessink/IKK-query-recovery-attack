Hey, since I hear you are doing the schedule now after all could you please 
remember to have me not working March 31st thru the 3rd.  Also since the 
schedule is totally going to change, if i work the 30th of March could you 
put me on the day shift instead of night.  I had negotiated some changes so 
that would work however, since it is going to change anyway please put me on 
a day shift if possible as I already bought a ticket to leave on the evening 
of the 30th.  Thanks.
