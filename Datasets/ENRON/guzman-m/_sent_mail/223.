Thanks I so much appreciate the support.  Actually I just got back from LA 
today so sorry I didnt write back.  My father passed away a couple weeks ago 
and I have been down there taking care of everything for my sister.  It has 
been a rough month.  I will write back later in the week or maybe call you or 
something.  How is everything with you?
