Thanks sweetheart.  I am hanging in there as good as can be expected.  I was 
down there for two weeks and spent nearly all day every day with my sister 
and getting her moved to my moms and taking care of the funeral and all his 
bills and stuff.  It was a very hard two weeks but, I am doing okay.  I am 
more worried about my sister than anything else though.  She has my mom and 
stepdad though.  I felt bad leaving but my work had been so cool to give me 
two weeks of paid that I figured I shouldn't push it.  Anyway, I would love 
to go grab a beer with you sometime in the near future.  It is kind of nice 
just to go out and forget about things once in a while.  So how is everything 
with you?  You and Billy good?   Hows your family?  Let me know sometime if 
you want to grab a beer or lunch or coffee or something.
