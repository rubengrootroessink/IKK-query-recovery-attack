Whats up lil' Kirky.  Don't worry about getting cut off I figured your phone 
just died or something.  I am so excited to come down there and hang out in 
the city.  I haven't hung out in the City since turning 21 and would love to 
go check things out.  That would be awesome if you could come into town on 
Wednesday or Thursday night.  Maybe we could grab dinner and some drinks.  I 
called your brother last night and left a message telling him that I was 
going to be in town.  Hopefully he isn't mad at me for all the assing out I 
did the weekend of Wilsons wedding.  I think my body is still recovering from 
all those shenanigans.  Anyway I will give you a call or email you early next 
week and let you know what our plan is for Wednesday and Thursday.  Look 
forward to seeing ya sweetie. Take Care!
