Thanks for the movie advice.  I am glad that you went out with Kathy and 
Charlene.  I think it is good for you guys to keep in touch.  I know people 
move on with their lives and grow out of touch but it seems like you guys 
have been friends for so long that it would be a shame for you to not keep in 
touch with each other.  Sorry we got in a fight yesterday. :(
