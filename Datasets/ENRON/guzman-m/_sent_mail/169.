Hey Tyson.  Are you guys doing anything after the game?  I think Ben Pacewic, 
Jeff Burns, Kevin Stangeland, Chris Hartman, Rueben Schug and some other guys 
are coming down and staying the night but i don't think we will have time to 
stop by before the game.  I know I would like to come by the house and see 
how things are doing and I am sure those guys would to so let me know if you 
guys have anything going on Saturday night.    

YITB
