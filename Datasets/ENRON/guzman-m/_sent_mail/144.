Yeah, I locked myself out of my house also.  really smart move!  I felt so 
terrible yesterday after our two nights of binge drinking.  I can't believe 
you stayed up partying until 6 in the morning.  You are CRAZY.  Hey did we 
make some sort of deal on those tickets.  I vaguely remember something to 
that effect.
