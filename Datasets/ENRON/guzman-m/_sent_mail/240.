Hey kiddo.  I didn't get in until last night.  My weekend went allright. Most 
of it was filled with family stuff.  Saturday night I just hung out with my 
dad and watched the beavs game on tv.  I did go out to Hollywood with some 
friends on Sunday night however. It was a friend of mines birthday so we went 
over to his house and then to this club in Hollywood.  It  was  a good time 
however, pretty mellow.  I went with my friends Chrissy and Allison and they 
both had to work on Monday so we left at around midnight.  It was okay with 
me however, as I really wasnt that into partying anyway.
Oh yeah, I got that job.  I think I start tommorow night which means I will 
be working this weekend which really sucks as there is a beavs game, but I am 
really looking forward to this new position.  How did your weekend go?  Any 
exciting stories?
