I switch back and forth from night to day shifts it depends on the week.  I 
have been working day shifts this week.  I would say I would like to watch 
the game but I am actually going to the game.  What about a beer later in the 
week or this weekend.  I think Johnson might be in town soon, I reecieved an 
email from him this week.
