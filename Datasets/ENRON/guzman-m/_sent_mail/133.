Dude I hear you are going to be in town this weekend.  Unfortunately I will 
be gone, I am going to SF to hang with Burnsy as i have a six day break from 
work.  I will however, be back in town on Sunday night.  If you are going to 
be in town  still maybe we could grab a beer late sunday night (I don't get 
in until 10) or grab lunch on Monday as I don't work monday.  Give me a call 
on my cell and let me know.  Oh, by the way i will be going out with the one 
and only Marc Johnson for some beers in the city on Friday night.  He is in 
the country for a month.  If you want to have a chat with the man give us a 
call that night 503-702-0463.  Take care buddy and happy holidays!  Oh yeah, 
what is your address. I am sending out some x-mas cards.
