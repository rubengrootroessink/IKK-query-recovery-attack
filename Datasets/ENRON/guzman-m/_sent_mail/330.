yeah I found out later in the week that you guys were gone.  Sounds like you 
had a great time!   I love Italy.  that place is so awesome.  I was over 
there about the same time of year in 93 and it was great because there was 
less tourists and it was a little cheaper but the weather was still pretty 
good.  You will have to tell me about it next time I see you.  So I am going 
down to the Beaver game on Saturday but i might go down to Eugene and hang 
out with Wilson tommorow night.  I will probably decide tonight but if I 
don't I would be into grabbing a few beers with you tommorow night after 
work.
