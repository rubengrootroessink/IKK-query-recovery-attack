Thats cool dude.  Sorry we missed you too.  We had a fun time on Saturday 
night.  Friday i took my sister to the blazer game.  She had a really good 
time.  Anyway, I have a 200 level seat behind the basket for game three of 
the playoffs do you want to go?  It is a $76 ticket.  I may be able to get 
game 4 (if neccesary) also if you are interested.  Let me know. It should be 
either the 25th or 26th.
