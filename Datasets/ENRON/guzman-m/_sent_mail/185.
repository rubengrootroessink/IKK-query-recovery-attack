On November 8th begining at HE 8 Tosco informed Real time that they were 
going off the grid with no return ETA.   They were scheduled in correctly for 
the day ahead at 7 MW.  We were able to take out hours 11-24 however, hours 
8-10 we were short ex-post by the 7 MW.  Toscos schedule was zeroed out by 
decing short term cali load in PGE 3 per Jeff Richter.  Note to real time 
night shift.  Tosco may be coming back on line completely but as of yet they 
have not  called back to notify when that may be.  Please contact me or 
Jeremy with any questions.
