Whats up Lester.  Are you going to go to the Bowl game.  It looks right now 
like it might be the fiesta or the Holliday Bowl.  If it is the Holliday Bowl 
i will probably go however if it is the Fiesta bowl I wont be able to make 
it.  How is the family.  Are you guys planning on coming out anytime soon
