Kim, who do you think you are fooling?  A drink or two?  Really?!?!  I think 
I have heard that one from you before.  I don't even say shit like that 
anymore because when I say shit like that I end up partying harder than I 
would have had I just kept my mouth shut.  But in respect for your new job we 
will make sure you are home and tucked in bed early!  :)  See ya soon!
