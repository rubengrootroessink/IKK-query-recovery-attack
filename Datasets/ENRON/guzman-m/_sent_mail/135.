okay so it's 2:30 am and I am so ready to be out of here it is ridiculous.  I 
am so excited to come down there and have some fun and just forget about work 
and all the other lame ass shit that has been going on in my life.  Anyway 
looking forward to seeing you and here is Burnsy's cell phone number 
415-710-3410.   Also remember if you don't want to drive home that night or 
take the Bart home (you taking the bart home alone scares me) you are more 
than welcome to crash at Burnsys house on Thursday night.  He has a pull out 
bed and told me to tell you you are more than welcome to crash there.  I will 
catch up with ya tommorow and we will figure out what to do Thursday night.
