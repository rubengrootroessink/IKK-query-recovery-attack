That sounds good to me.  Would it be to late for you to go to the 9 o clock 
movie.  I have some errands to run this evening in your area so, i could just 
cruise over to your house around 7:00 or so and we could grab a bite to eat 
and then hit a movie.  Until i get up to speed I will be working three nights 
on (6pm-6am) then two days off then three nights on.  I think my third or 
fourth week I will start working some days and work a little less.  Like 
three nights followed by  three days iff  followed by three days on.  I will 
have a schedule in advance for a month.  It looks like I should get two 
weekends off a month and then several weekdays off.  It is kind of messed up 
but it is such an awesome opportunity and i am really excited.
