Dont worry about it.  I had a good time.  I don't really know what our plan 
is for the Beaver Game as I am hanging out with Burns and some guys from my 
fraternity and hadn't really planned on hanging out with those guys until 
after the game.  But you can give me a call on my cell phone that day and I 
can let you know where the Winnebago is and maybe you guys can come meet us 
or if not we can meet up after the game or something.
