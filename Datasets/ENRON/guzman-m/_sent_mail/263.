Carla, this doesn't make much sense to me that we would both randomly add a 
sunday to block forward deals.  I looked both of them up and it appears that 
they were both index forward transactions and both were entered on the smae 
day.  Therefore it would appear that there may have been a problem with the 
masks?

There were two Block Forward deals in for Sunday on Peak.  I looked in the 
Block Forward log and did not see them being different from a straight on 
peak deal.  Therefore I changed the masks to exclude Sundays and Holidays.  
One was put in by Carla and the other by Mark. Here are the deal numbers 
#403599, and 403603.  If you have any questions let me know.
