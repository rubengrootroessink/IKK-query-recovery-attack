Well, I don't really know what to tell you.  I don't know Dave and all I 
really know is what you have told me which is that he has a bad temper and 
appears to have an alcohol problem.  I am sure he must be a good guy if you 
have been dating him this long though. Speaking of alcohol I have kind of 
come to a realization recently that I need to cut down on my own drinking.  
That is part of the reason i didn't drink this weekend. I am not going to 
stop going out for a few beers but, I am just tired of how I feel the next 
day and just laying around and shit.  And the thing with my dad has really 
scared me into being more  healthy.  Although it doesn't seem to really show 
to much i have been going to the gym 5-6 days a week and I just don't want to 
be my Dads age and be looking at the kind of health problems that he is 
havning right now.  

I think for you the best thing to do right now is to figure out whether you 
think you have a big enough future with Dave to go through with trying to 
help him with the problem. If you think you do and the drinking thing is an 
issue to you then you need to bring it up again when he is sober but  if you 
don't think so then maybe you should consider walking away.   Good luck and 
if you need someone to talk to or advice you can always count on me.
