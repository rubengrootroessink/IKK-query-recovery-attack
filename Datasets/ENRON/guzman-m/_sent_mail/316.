Hi, please check on the following deals:

408661.01
410930.01
418614.01

The trader is Bill Williams III.

These three deals are in under British Columbia Hydro & Power Authority.  I 
believe they should be under British Columbia Power Exchange Corporation.

Please let me know if you change them.

Thank you,
Melissa
