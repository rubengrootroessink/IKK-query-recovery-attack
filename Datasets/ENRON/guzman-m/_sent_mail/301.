Jubran, I need to know what dates these deals were done. Your spreadsheet 
does not say and scheduling wants to know what date to backdate it to.  They 
have also said that they would like to see the deal ticket as I had asked 
before however, am I correct in assuming that since these deals had to do 
with the purchase of PG&E  that you might not have a deal ticket on your 
end?  I already had the spreadsheet, however, they were asking for additional 
information and since Diana was out I got kind of thrown in the middle of 
this one.  Thank you for your help.  Have a great weekend.
