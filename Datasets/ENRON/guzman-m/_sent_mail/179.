Hey dave.  I have a night shift tonight so thats why I am not getting back 
to  you until now.   Regarding Thanksgiving I have the 18th through the 23rd 
off. It is one of those six day breaks i was telling you about.  So this 
saturday (18th) I am going to the Civil War (Uof O vs. OSU) footbal game.  I 
am way fired up about it.  It should be a great time.  Then on Sunday 
afternoon I will be flying in to Orange County at 3:30pm and will be down 
there through Thursday evening when I will be flying back home at 6:30.  
Unfortunately I have to work the Friday after thanksgiving but at least I 
will be able to spend thanksgiving day  and most of the week with all of 
you.  I am going to be staying at my mothers house for the week.  Maybe 
Sunday evening we can all have dinner together or something after i get in.  
Anyway looking forward to seeing all of you.  I should be able to come down 
again for Christmas as I have the 24th through the 29th off.  

Hey, have fun at the game and keep an eye on the scoreboard and root for the 
beavs!  If we win and Washington loses we go to the Rose Bowl  Take Care and 
see you this weekend!
