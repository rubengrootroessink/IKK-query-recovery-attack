Hey Katie, I am just getting off work here in a few minutes and thought i 
would drop you a line.  I am doing good.  I am sorry I missed your call on 
Saturday night.  I was at home and in bed by 9:30.  I went out until 3 am on 
Friday night and then Rick and I went skiing on Saturday morning and left at 
6:30 am.   We were skiing until 7pm up at Meadows so by the time I got home I 
just went straight to bed I was soooo exhausted.  Skiing was awesome however, 
and I did really well as I went and had my skis tuned.  What a difference 
that made.  While I was waiting for them to be tuned I ended up buying new 
skis, boots and poles.  I can't wait to try them out!  Anyway, things are 
going good for me.  I am a little depressed however as today is my Dads 
birthday. Also Cita is back in the hospital again.  She had another heart 
failure.  She is doing better though.   I am leaving tommorow morning to 
spend the rest of the week with my sister/visit Cita and then I am going to 
Vegas on Saturday with Jay, Jimmy, Caitlin, Nicole and a few other people.  I 
am excited to go and in a way it is kind of a deal for my dad as he loved to 
go to Vegas for his birthday and the Super bowl weekend.  Anyway, I better 
run.  I work tonight so email me back so I have something to read for the 
night shift.  How is everything with you?
