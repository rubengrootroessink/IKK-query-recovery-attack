Whats up dude?  Sorry I didnt respond to your previous email, I was really 
busy at work that day and didnt have the time to mail you back.  I am doing 
okay,  the job is going really good.  Whats up with you.  Things must not be 
going too well if you have to live with that asshole McGraw huh?  Tell him I 
said that too.  Anyway, lets grab a beer sometime in the near future.  Do you 
have a job or a you just lounging around the house all day spanking your 
monkey?
