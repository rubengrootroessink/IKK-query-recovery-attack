I just looked at myu schedule and I have to work neew years eve during the 
day and I don't know yet about new years day.. It really isn't that big of a 
deal to me.  The important thing for me right now is spending my free time to 
go down and spend time with my sister so I could kind of care less about 
going to the Beavers Bowl game when I can just watch it on TV. I mean it 
would be nice to go but it is not the slightest bit a priority for me right 
now.  So are you and dave seeing each other exclusively or are you dating 
other people?
