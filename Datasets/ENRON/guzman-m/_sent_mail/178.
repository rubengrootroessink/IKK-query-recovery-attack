Harbor Cogen called this on Monday night shift at approximately HE 24 stating 
that they would be unable to supply their day ahead schedules due to a crack 
in an oil supply line.  Mike at Harbor stated that we should not bid in day 
ahead schedules for Wednesday either as it appears to be a problem which may 
take some time to fix.  To cover the day ahead schedules we looked for power 
to cover it in SP however we could not find even an offer during the night 
shift.  I would advise Les and whomever is on the day and night shifts on 
Tuesday to keep in touch with Harbor regarding this issue.  Thank you for 
your attention to this matter and if you should have any questions please 
call me on my cell 702-0463
