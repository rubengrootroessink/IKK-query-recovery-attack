I don't believe for a second that you didn't make plans with Dave!  Monday 
will probably be okay.  I would say lets plan on it but I know how bad you 
are about shit like that so just call me Sunday and let me know.  If I don't 
hear from you by then I will just assume we aren't going.  have a great day
