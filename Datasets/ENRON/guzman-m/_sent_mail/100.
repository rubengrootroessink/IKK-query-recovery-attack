Yeah tell me about it.  So the reason I called to see if you wanted to do 
something last week was because I got a settlement on my some of my dads 
insurance shit and I wanted to go out to a nice dinner.  I thought it would 
be a nice opportunity for us to hang out and catch up.  I hope you don't 
still think that I didn't want to see you that night because you are dating 
dave, I just had to run some errands right when you called back.
