How about if we just scrap the position all together and let Al Gore sell the 
White House to the Chinese at a Budhist Campaign Fundraiser  for the 
Democratic Party.  And then let the entire country be governed by 
referendum.  Oh wait, lets see there are 50 referendums on my ballot anyway 
so maybe we don't need state congress either.
