Les, on 12/24 I input the Willamette transaction as usual however I could not 
get the deal number 471943 (transmission piece we have been using) to extend 
to this day.  Therefore in order to keep us flat I just created one 
transmission deal for 15MW HE 1-24 and used the normal pac transmission 
price.  I am not sure if this is correct or how this should eactly be 
handled.  I will be on break from the 24th thru the 30 so if you could fix 
the deal if that is not the correct way to do it, that would be greatly 
appreciated.  Also if you could let me know what was done for future 
reference.  Thanks,  Merry x-mas and Happy New Year!
