Yo baby whats up?  Thanks for hanging out with me on Monday night.  I had a 
really good time (even if you were preoccupied with the Dave thing).  I hope 
all is going well for you.  I am actually working a day shift which is pretty 
cool because there is a lot less to do on the day shifts.  So, what do you 
have going for the rest of the week?  I have a work function tonight.  One of 
my friends is moving to the Calgary office so we are all going for beers at 
the Lucky Lab in southeast.    I got a call from my date from hell.  
Aparently I told her last week that we could grab a movie tonight.  I don't 
want to go so I think I am just going to tell her that this work thing is 
going to last too late.  Anyway how is your grandmother doing?   Are you 
excited about your party this weekend?  I went and bought a couple dress 
shirts and a tie for my christmas party at Nordstrom yesterday and ended up 
spending $184 !  Just on two shirts and a tie.  I should just refrain from 
even going to that store.  Check ya later sweetie!
