Angela was pissed at a lot of things.  She was mad that we didn't invite her 
because it was guys weekend but then we ended up hanging out with Jessica and 
her friends.  The stupid thing was that she yelled at me!   She was really 
mad that I was hanging out with this Alisha girl most of the weekend.  I dont 
get it.  I got soo mad at her.  I went off on her about how everytime I hang 
out with any chicks she gets pissed and it is none of her fucking business 
what I do.  She said she was mad because I hung out with chicks in Vegas with 
Jay.  The stupid thing is that Jay didn't even dance with any chicks or 
anything.  He was on way good behavior.  I completely melted down on her and 
I told her she needed to go get counseling.  
The love life is off and on right now. I have been seeing Nicole when I go 
down to LA however, I think between all the shit her and I get from Jay, my 
sister, and Chrissy, it really isnt worth the hassle and has kind of made it 
a little uncomfortable.  I did meet that Alisha girl and hooked up with her a 
little this weekend.  She is really cool and she is totally someone I would 
date, if I lived in LA.  We really clicked.  I am going down there next 
weekend so maybe I will hang out with her instead of Nicole.  I don't know.  
The Nicole thing with my sister and Jay and Chrissy really pissed me off 
bad.   
As far as girls up here my love life is pretty non existant.  There is this 
girl from work that I really like and we hang out a lot but nothing much has 
really happened yet.  I am really never here very much anymore.  Anytime I 
have breaks from work I have been going to LA.  I have been sending some 
resumes around down there and I am pretty seriously considering moving back.  
I am just kind of bored with Portland and there really isn't a lot for me 
here.  You never really talked about whats going on with you these days?
