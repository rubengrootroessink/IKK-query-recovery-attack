Bill I have a freind that just graduated from Oregon State with a business 
degree i think his emphasis was MIS and finance.  He is a pretty bright kid 
and wants to pursue a carrer in finance.   I actually talked to him about it 
at some length about Enron on New Years Day and he seemed very interested.  
.  He is a friend of mine from my fraternity and a really good guy who I 
think would fit in well here if given the opportunity.  I dont know about 
your feelings on hiring guys right out of college.  I know we had done so in 
the past but I wasn't really sure about your feelings on that.  Let me know.
