Jesse, per my email to Bill last week I need to take March 31st thru April 3 
off to take care of some family business down in LA.  I have already 
purchased my ticket leaving on the evening of the 30th so, if you are 
planning on scheduling me for the 30th please make it a day shift.  Thanks a 
lot.
