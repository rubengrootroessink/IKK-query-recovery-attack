Are you guys going to the Beaver game this weekend and if so Wilson had 
mentioned that you guys were going down to his house on friday night.  Is 
this correct?  If so I would love to head down there with you guys on Friday 
but if not I will probably just stay in Portland and go to Corvallis on 
Saturday morning.  Let me know.
