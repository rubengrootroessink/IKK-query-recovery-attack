18:59 GMT 12 December 2000 DJ US Energy Secretary Warns Pwr Producers In
West On Prices
WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--As California's electricity system teeters on the
brink of collapse, U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson warned power
producers not to attempt to take advantage of the power-supply crisis.
"I am very concerned about the condition of power markets in the West.
Electricity supplies in parts of the region are tight and prices charged for
wholesale power in the region continue to spiral out of control," Richardson
said in a press release late Monday.
Richardson urged power providers not to attempt to take advantage of the
crisis by price gouging.
"While I have no specific knowledge of any such activities, it is important
that generators located throughout the region and in Canada and Mexico
understand that the administration won't tolerate any actions designed to
take advantage of the situation," Richardson said.
The energy secretary criticized a decision by Kaiser Aluminum Corp. (KLU) to
shut down an aluminum smelter in the Pacific Northwest that receives
low-cost power from the Bonneville Power Administration and resell that
power in open markets for a profit of $52 million.
"I have instructed Bonneville to explore all necessary actions to prevent
Kaiser from remarketing this power," Richardson said.
