Dave, I am planning on driving up after I get off work on Saturday morning 
and should be up in Seattle by about 10:30 or so.  I will probably just go to 
Jorge's and crash out until you arrive.  Have you guys made any plans for 
Saturday night?  I talked to Donald, he wasn't aware that you were even 
coming but he said he would like to do something with all of us.  We actually 
talked about maybe going skiing on sunday I don't know if you would be 
intereseted in doing  that.
