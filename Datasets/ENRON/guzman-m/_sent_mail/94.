Hey there Kim! Sorry this response is so late!  I read your email on a night 
when I was really busy and then just kind of spaced out in replying back.  So 
I got your pictures and the card.  Thanks a bunch!  My Christmas went pretty 
well and I actually got to go out on New years eve as my schedule changed at 
the last minute.  I went to the Hilton with my friend Valarie and it was 
pretty cool.  I had a great time and ended up partying in a suite with these 
girls that I met there until about 5 am.  I talked to Burns a few days ago 
and I guess he is still seeing that chick.  I didn't ask about the living 
situation but I would imagine it would take some time to find a place down 
there.  So anyway how was your New Year.?  How did everything go with Ricky?  
I would be stoked if you came up for a long weekend or something!  Anyway I 
gotta run.  Talk to you later!
