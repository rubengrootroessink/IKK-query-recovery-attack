I dont know. We could go out in Northwest over by my house.  There are a ton 
of places over there like the Green Room, The Gypsy, Brazen Bean, 21st Ave 
Bar and Grill.  I don't realy know any places over by your house.  For me 
sometime around 8:00 would be good but really I am pretty easy as to where.  
Why don't you call me around 6pm on my cell at 702-0463 or at home 228-7767 
and we can figure it out. Unless you had any ideas?
