Group,
Please see below.  It is important that we notify our customers regarding 
changes in the schedules.  All the updated phone numbers have been put in 
your boxes and a sheet with numbers is also taped to the desk.  If you cannot 
reach a customer, please attempt to notify Chris Foster or myself.
Thanks,
Bill

Bill:

Can you make an effort to tell everyone in real time to try to remember to 
contact the services customers when a schedule adjustment that incs of decs 
their generation comes from the ISO.  If we tell them what their final 
schedule is, they can't argue that it was our fault.  Even if we do not 
notify them, it is currently our position, that it is not our fault, but at a 
minimum, for customer service, we should try to notify them.

Thanks!

Chris
