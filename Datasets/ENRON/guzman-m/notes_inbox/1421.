etown.com Promotion Ends December 15th
How Does It Work / Bonus Miles
Earn Up to $1,500 in Free Electronics

ETOWN.COM PROMOTION ENDS DECEMBER 15th

Remember, you must sign up with a MyAlaskaAir account by December 15 to
qualify for the Alaska Airlines etown.com promotion.

If you have flown or are planning on flying Alaska Airlines or Horizon Air
between October 1, 2000 and December 15, 2000 you could earn up to $1,500
in free electronics from etown.com, the premier online consumer
electronics source.

___________________________________________________________________
HOW DOES IT WORK?  EASY.

1) Sign up with a new MyAlaskaAir account at www.alaskaair.com  before
December 15. A MyAlaskaAir account speeds you through alaskaair.com when
you want to book and purchase online. It allows you to securely and
conveniently store preference information such as favorite destinations,
seating choice, contact information, even your billing credit card if you
choose. It's free, takes only minutes, AND you'll earn 1,000 Mileage Plan
BONUS MILES just for signing up. Make sure you include your Alaska
Airlines Mileage Plan number to qualify for this promotion.

2) Fly Alaska Airlines or Horizon Air between October 1, 2000 and December
15, 2000 and earn miles on your Mileage Plan account as you would
normally. Qualifying flights made before you sign up with a MyAlaskaAir
account will count and it doesn't matter how you book or purchase your
tickets (you don't have to purchase online to qualify). Every segment you
earn will count toward your etown.com certificate award amount. The
etown.com certificates will be emailed to you in mid February.

Every round-trip you fly is at least two segments, so frequent flyers can
rack up free electronics fast. BUT REMEMBER, no matter how many Mileage
Plan flight miles you earn, you have to sign up with a new MyAlaskaAir
account (and include your Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan number) by December
15, 2000 to qualify!

___________________________________________________________________
