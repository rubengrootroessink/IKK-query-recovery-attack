All,

There are 7 deals in January entered by several different real-time folks 
that have PAC tranny purchase price as 8.09 - this is incorrect.  When you 
purchase tranny from PAC please use the rate of 5.84.  If you have entered 
any deals in February at the rate of 8.09 - please go back and fix them.

Caroline
