The Golden Telephone

?A highly recruited high school football player was visiting schools to
find
the best university for him. His first stop was the University of
Washington.? When he got there, Coach
Rick Neuheisel immediately picked up a golden telephone.? After talking for

several minutes, he said, "Thank you, God" and hung up.? This shocked the
young man. He asked the coach what was so special about the golden phone.
"Well,
?this phone is a direct line to God.? God tells us whether or not new
recruits? would be stars at our university."

The athlete asked if he could use the phone to ask God what college he
should pick. "Sure, you can!? But it's going to
cost you $2,000.? Calling Heaven isn't cheap."? The fellow didn't have that

kind of money, so he moved along.

His next stop was at the University of Oregon.? Upon entering Coach Mike
Bellotti's office, Coach Bellotti immediately picked up a similar golden
telephone.? After talking several minutes, he said, "Thank you, God" and
hung up.? The boy said, "Hey, I've seen those phones before.? Can I use
yours to call God and ask what college I should pick?"? Coach Bellotti
said,
"Sure, but it's going to cost you $1,000.? Calling Heaven isn't cheap."
Again, not having that kind of money, the young man left.? Who would want
to
live in Eugene anyway?

?His last stop was in Corvallis at Oregon State University.? Upon arrival
at
the office, Coach Dennis Erickson picked up a golden telephone, talked to
God, and said, "Thanks," and hung up. The boy just had to use that phone,
so
he said,
?"Coach Erickson, I really need to use that golden telephone so I can call
God and ask him which college I should choose.? From Washington it was
going
to cost me $2,000.? From Oregon they wanted $1,000.? So how much will it
cost me
?to call Heaven from here at Oregon State?"

The coach smiled and said,? "Nothing, son. It's a local call."

GO BEAVERS!!!
