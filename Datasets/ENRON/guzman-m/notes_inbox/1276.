BPA C#23851-BPA(T)SYS/SYS O#95363 HNF-BPA-EPMI-PACW

This schedule was originally supposed to go on Pacw transmission, but late in 
the day they said they never agreed to that and would not do it.

Shawna at BPA agreed to use their transmission on a real time basis for 
Friday only.  

Please call this schedule in to the appropriate real time departments.
