how about them Lakers !!!     There is only one thing I can say..... or
maybe 3 words.     MEN AGAINST BOYS !!.      Didn't they just kick ass!
They are peaking at just the right time.     The Dodgers are in first place
and the Kings have gone beyond everyone's expectations.   Life is good in
Southern California.

On the down side,  Ramon got admitted into the hospital over the weekend.
It started out as a  problem with very low blood sugar but then escalated
into a weak heart problem with very shallow breathing.   They have him on a
respirator and plan to wean him off of that this morning.   Cita is all
stressed out but thank god that one of her neighbors is spending the night
with her.      We're getting an update today on some tests performed on
Ramon, so we'll know alot more.

Cita is doing fairly well.    I took her for a four hour heart exam last
week and it revealed that her last heart attack caused some arterial
damage.    The doctor said that if she was younger, he would perform
angioplasty.    In any case, her spirits are remarkably high and is still
mentally sharp.

On another matter,  I got a call last Friday from Ford Motor Credit
regarding your account.    They left a number and asked if you could call
them because "they have not been able to reach you".     The number they
left was 877-873-0085.      Apparently, you left me as a reference on the
application.

Hope you are doing ok and am looking forward to seeing you in June!
love ya,
Dave
