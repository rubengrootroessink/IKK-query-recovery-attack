Recently, 4 parking spots have become available at the World Trade Center as 
part of Enron's lease.   We will begin to allocate these spots based on the 
following criteria and establish a waiting list that will be managed by the 
Portland office for any future spots.

1.  Any employee who was full-time ENA (or Portland transition company) on or 
before November 30, 1998 (tenure in office, time must be consecutive).
2.  Any employee who has been identified as being on a waiting list for WTC 
spots.

We have identified the following list of employees who meet the above 
criteria.

Bob Badeer
Heather Dunton
Caroline Emmert
Carla Hoffman
Stewart Rosman
Julie Sarnowski
Cara Semperger
Brett Hunsucker
Murray O'Neil
Les Rawson
Jeff Richter
Donald Robinson
Chris Stokley
Mike Etringer
Diana Scholtes
Sean Crandall
John Malowney
Phil Platter
Karen Jones
Jan King 
Jim Gilbert
Kathy Axford

If your name is not listed and you meet the above criteria, please see Amy 
FitzPatrick by close of business Friday, March 16th. 

A drawing will then be held to determine the order in which the spots will be 
allocated.  Once this list is exhausted, we will continue to build the 
waiting list based on tenure in the Portland office.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Thanks!
Amy
