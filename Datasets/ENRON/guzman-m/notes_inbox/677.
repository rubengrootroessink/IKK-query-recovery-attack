This evening we have dinner plans.

But your ideas for saturday are good.  The plan right now is to go to Kells 
in the afternoon (1:00 - 2:00) and beat the rush.  I will get the exact times 
from Heidi today and let you know.  As for later, we are open to anything 
(almost anyting).

When I find out more information I will call or email you.

Later,

Rick
