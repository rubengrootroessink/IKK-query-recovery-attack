I attended a meeting yesterday for the volleyball league.  I have entered us 
in the coed E League (5-6 teams) which plays games on Thursday at 7pm or 8pm 
(I have asked them schedule us for 7 pm and they said they could accomodate 
us).  The league will start on April 5th for 10 weeks and playoffs after that 
if we qualify.  The locations will be at various Portland High Schools, which 
can vary from as close to Benson Tech to as far as St. John's.  The cost will 
be about $20 per person and each person will receive a shirt.  I wanted to 
get a commitment now that we have all the information in and that you will be 
able to come to the games on consistent basis.  Please email Heather Dunton 
to confirm.
