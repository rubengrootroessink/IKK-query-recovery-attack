Dear Mark and Geir,

I ran the audit viewer for deal # 521304.1 sale to Reliant and Mark Guzman's 
name came up as the person who added the strip for HE 18- HE 19.  (that means 
Mark or Geir).  As this is on the verge of a real - time shift change and I 
can find no notes in either of your books regarding a sale to Reliant, could 
you both please look in your logs and notes and at the Inc sheets and tell me 
who did the deal and who at Reliant you spoke to.  They are not showing this 
purchase from us.   Please also advise if the deal is in but under a 
different counterparty so that we can make proper changes.

When you respond to this e-mail, please be sure to Cc: Joy Werner in Houston 
as this matter needs to be cleaned up ASAP.

Thanks,

Virginia
