"The owners of Palo Verde East transmission system have completed studies 
supporting an increase in the system's rating from 3810 MW to 4750 MW. This 
increase in TTC affects the PV-WestWing 500kV #1 and #2 transmission lines 
adn the PV-Kyrene 500kV transmission line path rating.  This new TTC will 
become effective at 12:01 am on February 1, 2001

The owners of the three transmission lines are Arizona Public Service, El 
Paso Electric Company, PNM, and SRP. The increased rating will be allocated 
to each company based upon their ownership share of the transmission lines."
