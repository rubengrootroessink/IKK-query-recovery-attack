Guz,

We're still having a party on Saturday night.  I didn't get the invitations
out in a timely fashion, so here is your official invitation complete with
directions.

When:  Saturday night 9pm or so.

Where:  7616 NE Andover St.
        Hillsboro, OR  97124
        503-648-8276

How:  Take 26 to Cornelius Pass Road.  You will cross back over 26 going the
correct direction on Cornelius Pass Road.  Head straight 3 miles to Quatama
(look for the Elks Lodge sign), take right onto Quatama... 50 yards take an
immediate left.  We are in the first condo on your left.  There are 3 under
construction across the street, and it will be very hard to miss.  Call us
if you get lost, but you should be all good.

Bring a friend if you want and a beverage of your choice.  We will have
beer, vino, and some food....

Hope you can make it and sorry about the delay getting this to you.
-Boyd
