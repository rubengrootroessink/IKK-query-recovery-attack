Subject: Transalta Service Summary

John here is a brief summary of a service transaction which we have with 
Transalta:

Enron serves as schedule coordinator for Transalta for all SC-SC trades and 
exports on a day ahead basis.  The exports are exposed to transmission cuts 
and could affect real time.  All costs are passed through to Transalta so it 
is key we record when energy does not flow to Victorville Lugo.  Perhaps to 
help record what activity gets done on a daily basis Les or myself should 
record in Lotus Notes the transactions that are exported.  Let me know if 
that will solve any confusion.  Thanks.


Stewart



PS I need your real time service numbers for Aug, Sept
