Subject: Change in Holiday Pay Calculation

We have made changes in the holiday pay compensation policy in an attempt to 
clarify this issue for those affected.   I am confident that you will be 
agreeable with the decision that has been approved by Tim, Jeff , Amy & 
myself.

The payment will be made in the form of a lump sum that is payable in 
addition to your normal compensation:

Major Holidays worked:    $500
Minor Holidays worked:     $250


The classification of the remaining holidays will be as follows:

Thanksgiving day - major 
Day after - minor
CHRISTMAS PARTY - major
Christmas Eve - minor 
Christmas Day - major
New Years Eve - major
New years Day - minor



If a shift touches a major holiday,  ie the night shift of Christmas eve 
spills into Xmas ,  you will be paid for a major holiday.
The only exception to the above rule is the 6pm to 6am shift on New Year's 
Day.   This is not considered a holiday.


We think this is a more straightforward plan that provides more incentive to 
those working the  holidays.


This is a policy that is new and subject to  change at any time.    If you 
have questions about the policy, please contact myself or Amy Fitzpatrick.

Thanks and have a great holiday season.
