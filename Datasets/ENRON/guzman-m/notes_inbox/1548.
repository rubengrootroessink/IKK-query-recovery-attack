I have very few employee's lists of accomplishments thus far.    I have an 
offsite   meeting to represent the group on Tuesday.     I need as much time 
as possible to adequate represent you guys.     I had previously asked for 
this asap about 2 weeks ago.     

Get this info to me now if you had not submitted it previously.
