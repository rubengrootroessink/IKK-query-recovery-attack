 A dad walks into a market followed by his ten-year-old son. The kid is
spinning a 25 cent piece in the air and catching it between his teeth. As
they walk through the market someone bumps into the boy at just the wrong
moment and the coin goes straight into his mouth and lodges in his throat.
>
> He immediately starts choking, going blue in the face, and Dad starts
panicking, shouting for help.
>
> A middle-aged, non-descript man in a gray suit is sitting at a
> coffee bar in the market reading his newspaper and sipping a cup of
coffee.   At the sound of the commotion, he looks up, puts his coffee cup
down on the saucer, neatly folds his newspaper and places it on the counter.
Then he gets up from his seat and makes his unhurried way across the market.

> Reaching the boy, the man carefully takes hold of the boy's testicles and
squeezes gently but firmly. After a few seconds the boy convulses
violently and coughs up the 25 cent piece, which the man catches in his free
hand.
>
> Releasing the boy, the man hands the coin to the father and
walks back to his seat in the coffee bar without saying a word.
>
> As soon as he is sure that his son has suffered no lasting ill-effects,
the father rushes over to the man and starts effusively thanking him saying,
"I've never seen anybody do anything like that
before -- it was fantastic. Are you a doctor?"
>
> "Good heavens, no," the man replies. "I am a tax collector for
the Internal Revenue Service."
