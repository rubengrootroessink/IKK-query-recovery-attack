Group,

Please use the Alberta Phone Log next to the PX trade app.  We need to record 
the exact time and instructions from each separate conversation.  After 
writing it down, please transfer your notes to the alberta power dispatch log 
on their web site.  This log can be found at http://albertapower
Go to the admin tab, and use the dispatch log portion (this site is very 
similar to the California Daily book site).  Like everything else, the more 
detail the better.

Also, we need to make sure that mws are in the "merit order" before we 
dispatch them.  So if Transalta offers us 5 mws, we only want to take those 
if all 353 mws of ours are dispatched.  Otherwise we are not going to have 
the pool taking our mws at the final bid price, and we will not be maximizing 
the value of our unit.

IF you have questions, and you should, please see me, Ryan or Monica.  I am 
always available for phone calls and will explain whatever you may not have 
picked up from the various emails or manual in your box.

Bill
