WE are long 50 mws at PV HE7 - HE22 on Saturday 12/16.  We parked this energy 
with EPE.  I have already made the purchase side from EPE on Saturday in 
Enpower (#481172) and the sale side will need to be entered in Enpower when 
you sell the energy Saturday morning.  Please route the deal, input the price 
as sold, and send me an email detailing who it went to, when and where.   We 
purchased the energy at $175...I have not had a bid at Palo too far over 
$125.  
LDWP is looking to buy.  Be aggressive, make it easy for the dispatchers and 
get this bilat sale DONE.

Thanks for your attention and good luck.

Bill
