Hey, sorry I called you drunk last night.  I had a pretty bad day and
decided to end my two weeks of sobreity last night.  I was calling becasue
Sul flaked on taking me to the airport and I am going to be gone until next
Wednesday. I couldn't find anyone to take me to the airport and I was going
to ask you if you could as a huge favor but, I decided I will just park my
car there instead.  sorry if I bothered you.  Have a great weekend.
