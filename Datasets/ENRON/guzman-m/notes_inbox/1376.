1528ESTNorthwest Pwr Sellers Want Cash First
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--The California Independent System Operator said
Wednesday that there was more than a 50% chance the state would have rolling
blackouts as early as 2:00 p.m. PST and possibly lasting through 7:00 p.m..
A dozen market participants in the Northwest have refused to sell emergency
power to the ISO unless it can pay in cash because of doubts about the ISO's
creditworthiness.
The ISO needs 4,000-5,000 megawatts of imports from the Northwest; it's
receiving virtually none, said ISO Chief Operating Officer Kellan Fluckiger.

1601EST Up To 4,000 MW Could Be Interrupted
The ISO's Fluckiger said that, if blackouts occur, the first round of
interruptions would be 1,000 MW around 2 PM. Around 4 PM, when demand on the
system begins to increase, 3,000-4,000 MW would be interrupted in half-hour
chunks throughout the state, he said.
Two-thirds of the blackouts would occur in Northern California and one-third
in Southern California. The City of Los Angeles would not be affected
because it is serviced by the L.A. Department of Water and Power, a
municipal utility outside ISO management.
Northern California would be affected more because transmission line
constraints are inhibiting the amount of power that can be transported from
southern to northern California.
About 8,500 MW are off the state's power grid. Approximately 3,300 MW of
power has been taken off by generators because natural gas is too expensive
to run their plants.
Fluckiger would not say which generators had taken units off for this
reason, but said it was legal for them to do so.
The ISO has asked for assistance from the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, the state Public Utilities Commission and the governor to avoid
blackouts.
There is not much the PUC can do in this situation, said a source close to
the issue. The governor could provide collateral from the state budget on
behalf of the ISO so the ISO could pay for out-of-state power, said the
source, who asked not to be named.
