We have purchased LV Cogen for tomorrow.  We have 7 mws for HE 6-10, and 52 
mws for 11-16, then 7 mws again for 17-24.  We have bought this at Mead 230 
(no need to buy transmission) in NEVP's control area from ST-West Services at 
$150.  We will be long in position manager.  Stan Cocke will provide deal #'s 
and oasis #'s from NEVP transmission for the tags.  We have seen SP-15 run up 
substantially the last few days in the afternoon, and today SP-15 has been 
trading as high as $250.  Please call me with any questions.
Thanks,
Bill
