Just letting you know EL Paso now has another person that needs to get the 
model everyday. Also, Roger has not been getting the model consistently. I 
don't know if this is an email system problem or an oversight by us. Either 
way it makes us look bad. Here is the new email address put it in your 
address book and use it wisely:)
 kpeterso@epelectric.com, rhawki1@epelectric.com, dmilik1@epelectric.com
Thanks
