Subject: PX Cut Procedures - PLEASE READ AND PRINT

Attached are procedures for cuts to PX schedules @ tie points.  Please print 
and put in your notebooks.  

My apologies to those of you that I have confused on this process because of 
conflicting and/or erroneous information from me.  For those who may have 
entered deals based on prior info from me, I'll take care of it.  The deals 
that are not entered correctly should fall out in my reconciliation @ the end 
of the month, and I'll fix them.  But, if you're feeling the holiday spirit 
and can think of a specific cut that may be in Enpower incorrectly, feel free 
to change it (only for deals in November or December).
