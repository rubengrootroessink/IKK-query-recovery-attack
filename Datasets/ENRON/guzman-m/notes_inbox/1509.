I have made slight revisions to the November work schedule to accomodate the 
Dispatcher Training trip of Geir and Holden at the end of this month.   
Monika C.   has been changed from a N to a Day shift on the last day of the 
month.     Bill and Holden switched a day.    

The schedule for December has been revised as well.         Jeremy Morris is 
leaving the group for the California Desk (congrats!)  and we have two new 
employees to work into the schedule.
Additionally,   we had to schedule around the Christmas party on the 2nd,   
Christmas and New Year's Eve.     Jesse Bryson and David Porter are scheduled 
to work on the evening of the Christmas party.   Bill Williams is scheduled 
tentatively for both Christmas and New Years eve.    
I will be revising the schedule for this occurence,   as this is clearly not 
acceptable.

I am looking for a volunteer for either of these holidays.    Absent of that 
,    I will conduct a drawing or assign someone.
No one is thrilled about working holidays,  etc.   but as a Real Timer -   
that is a huge part of the commitment that you made to the group.

I will be using new scheduling system software to schedule the new year.   If 
you want to make changes to the schedule,   you will approve these through me.
I anticipate that there will be no problems swapping days with another 
trader, provided that they are of like skill level and you dont net fewer 
days in a given month.   Once again,  I will revise the schedule to reflect 
these changes.

If you have any questions about the work schedules or anything thing else,  
give me a call.

Thanks,

JMF
