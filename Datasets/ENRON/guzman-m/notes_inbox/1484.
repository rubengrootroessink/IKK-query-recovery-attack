18:50 GMT 28 November 2000 DJ Class Action/Calif Generators -2: Seeking $4B
In Damages
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--A class action lawsuit was filed in San Diego late
Monday against energy companies that own and operate power plants in
California, alleging generators unlawfully manipulated the state's power
market, resulting in severe wholesale and retail price spikes in the state
for consumers.
The suit names Reliant Energy Inc. (REI), Duke Energy North America (DUK),
NRG Energy, Southern Energy Company (SO), Dynegy Inc. (DYN), AES Corp. and
Williams Energy as defendants.
The plaintiffs are seeking at least $4 billion in damages for electricity
supply bought through the California Power Exchange last summer.
