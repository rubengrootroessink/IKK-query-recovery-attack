Hi Mark,

David got home tonight and told me the fun you guys had in Seattle.? The snow 
shoe hike sounded like a good work out and fun too, but I'm sure I wouldn't 
have made it as smoothly as the rest of you.? I'm so fucking fat and I'm 
determined to get back in the shape that I should be and the way I was most 
of my life!? I've got to start working out on a consistent basis.? David said 
that if I don't the family is going to have a FAT intervention on me!!!

By the way, a note about Cita.? I can't even begin to tell you how much she 
loves you and since Bill left us she's even looking at you as a spiritual 
replacement of him.? Now I'm not saying that she doesn't love Angela as much, 
but Cita has a bond with the boys in our family (Kevin, Donald, Steve) in a 
totally different way as she does with the girls!!? I can't explain why (I've 
got my theories) but she just does.? 

Anyway, I was visiting her on Monday and she was really distraught about the 
last conversation she had with you over the phone while you were at Jorge's 
house.? She said that she felt that you misunderstood what she meant when she 
said that Bill was stupid.? I'm sure you know what she meant by it as far as 
him not wanting to change his life style (drinking & smoking), but she felt 
that you got mad at her for calling him stupid.? Her biggest consern is that 
she feels for that reason you probably won't want to talk to her again or 
much at all!!? I did tell her that you are a dick but that you're not that 
big of a dick!!? Regardless, we all know that you're a?prick anyway, but 
could you please give her a call sometime soon just to put her mind at ease?? 
You don't have to mention the "stupid" word or conversation, just call her to 
say hi and that you miss her more than she misses you!? Don't tell her that I 
emailed you about! my conversation with her.? Otherwise she'll just say "what 
the fuck is an email?"

Looking forward to seeing you later this month.(the 23rd)? Also, I want you 
to know that you're really not a prick, your a dickhead!

As always - with way more love than you deserve,? Uncle (fat) Bobby!!!
