Hey Guz, just wanted to write and say hello and see how things are going
with you.  Things down here are going good.  I put my two weeks in with my
company last week and I am starting my new job on FDeb 12th.  It is with a
company called Arcade planet, which is an Internet Gaming and Coin Operated
company.  The position is an Internet Advertising sales position. There will
be travel to New York, Chicago, LA and Vegas in the future once I learn what
the heck I am doing so I am totally excited about that.  I went snowboarding
on sat and that was a blast.  I am trying to take advantage of being back in
this area again.  I am hoping to get up there at least three or four more
times before the season ends.
Things with Ricky and I are good.  He sent me an incredible email that wiped
me off of my feet last week and so at least I know now that he is still
totally and fully into the relationship that we have.  It is hard to tell
when he is there and I am here of what is really going on between the two of
us.  His plan is to move out here in Dec. when he finishes school so I guess
we will just wait and see what happens in the next 10 months until then.
Hope all is well with you.
I would love to hear from you again to catch up!!
Lots of love, little woody!
