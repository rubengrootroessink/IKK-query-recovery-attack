Wouldn't it be nice to get the freaking gas prices down.  It is killing us
out here in Cali and I amm sure everyone else is on their way to higher
prices.  We are at about $2.00 right now and they are predicting that we
will be at $3.00 by summer in Cali!
Pass this on and hopefully it will make a difference!
Love ya all!!
