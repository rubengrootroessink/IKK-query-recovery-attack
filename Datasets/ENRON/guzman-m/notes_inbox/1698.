We are unable to complete a "prelim"  profit or loss statement because of 
computer coding complications between enpower and portcalc.  Two of the I.T. 
managers are working on it and think that they can complete their "fix" 
Saturday.  They will call me at home with a report on their hopeful success.

I will leave you and John L. a voice mail regarding same if it is not 
completed by Monday.
