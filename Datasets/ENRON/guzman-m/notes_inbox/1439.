1226EST Forecast Demand May Surpass Record
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)-- A 230-kilovolt and a 115-kilovolt line went down
near Bakersfield, Calif., Monday morning and tripped a 400-megawatt
generator off line, causing a stage one power emergency, a spokeswoman for
the California Independent System Operator said.
The identity of the generator, which went off line about 7 AM PST (1500
GMT), wasn't immediately available. One of the two power lines that went
down is now back up, but a spokeswoman couldn't identify which line it was.
A total of 10,000 MW is off line Monday, with 7,000 MW off the grid for
planned maintenance and 3,000 MW off for unplanned maintenance, spokeswoman
Stephanie McCorkle said.
McCorkle said Monday's forecast peak was 34,257 MW, near the record winter
peak of 34,432 MW reached Dec. 13, 1999. McCorkle also said there is a good
chance Monday's forecast peak could change and surpass the record winter
peak.
Electricity forward prices in the Mid-Columbia River hub were higher Monday
than they were last summer, when demand outstripped supply. January was
trading Monday at $475/MWh, and balance-of-December was trading at $525/MWh.
Third-quarter trades were at $250/MWh.
A market participant said the ISO had a call out to buy 3,000 MW of power
from outside of California, which is usually done only in emergency
situations. But the ISO didn't comment on that.
The stage one emergency, which means operating reserves in the state are
below 7%, was expected to remain in effect until 10 PM PST (0600 GMT).
McCorkle said she didn't anticipate the state would go to a stage two
emergency, when voluntary power curtailments may be instituted for customers
who agree to cut power for reduced rates.
