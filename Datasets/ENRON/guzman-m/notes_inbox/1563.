Mid C LLH,   we have 2 schedules  that are going real time due to 
curtailments at Lagrande

10 MW all LLH,  IPC@ AMPS-EPMI-FCPD(T)BPA(T)HOTSPRINGS/JD O# 
10043-EPMI-PGE(T)JD/MALIN O#GF-EPMI-PWX-PWXSC@NP15

15 MW all LLH,  IPC@ AMPS-EPMI-GHPD(T)BPA(T)HOTSPRINGS/JD O# 
96083-EPMI-PGE(T)JD/MALIN O#GF-EPMI-PWX-PWXSC@NP15


 IPC knows, PGE trans knows,  PRM said they would call it in to BPA, and PWX 
is going to call it in to CISO

Please keep an eye on this and double check with BPA and PGE tranny to 
confirm when the time comes.

Thanks,

Cara
