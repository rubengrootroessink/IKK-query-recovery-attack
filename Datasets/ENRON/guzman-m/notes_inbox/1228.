I'm ok.  Coming down with a cold so I feel like shit.  Found out I got
accepted to these apartments I wanted which is cool.  I'm just a little
stressed because move in costs are always a bitch.

Never mind.  So anyway, I am totally worked right now.  I went to the
Blazer game with my friend Kate and we ended up going out afterward.  i
ended up staying out until 2am and I had to be in to work at 5:30.  So
basically my day is totally sucking.  How are you doing?
