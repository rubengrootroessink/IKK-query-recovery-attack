Greetings-
I will be passing out a report of settlements issues that have come from 
Volume Mgmt.     If your name appears on the report, then you are responsible 
for clearing this discrepancy.
You may not have been actually working during this time period,  ie,  a deal 
may have been extended in scheduling under your name.
However,  I am holding each person who's name appears responsible for 
clearing this  issue.   If you are required to pull tapes,  come see me for 
approval.

Several issues on the list have been cleared previously.   We must 
communicate this info to Caroline so that she can make the appropriate 
entries into the 
DMS (Dispute Management System).      You may be asked to complete other 
settlements discrepancies as well.

This is a huge issue,  as our trading strategies were a bit hard to follow 
from Settlements viewpoint.    We need to assist this process to make sure 
that Enron gets the actual money that Real Time claimed that we made.

I want everyone to understand that just because we have a discrepancy with a 
customer,  I am certainly not assuming that you/we are in the wrong.
In more than one half of all disputes,  we are correct.    In this case,  we 
need to prove our position with tapes,  etc.


Thanks,

JMF
