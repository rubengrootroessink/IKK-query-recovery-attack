Check out this email I got from my Mom.  Classic.  She's still hopeful.

What's the haps?  Sorry I didn't get to talk to you much the other night.
Mom always has me going in several different directions and it's hard to
chat.  You just need to come over to the house more.  Angela and I were
talking yesterday and we decided that you can't go to LA.  Ang is planning
on moving back here and she doesn't want you to move.  I don't either.  It's
hard enough that I have one kid far away.  And LA is a HARD place to live
without friends already being there.  Now if you and Mark were together and
both of you moved there, that would be easier for me to take.
