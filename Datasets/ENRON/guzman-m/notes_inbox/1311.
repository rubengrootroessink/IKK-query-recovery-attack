Hello all! I hope things are doing well for you!

I just wanted to send out a reminder about the holiday party... If you have 
not yet responded, please let me know if you are available (even for an hour 
or so early in the party). Your friends are welcome to come as well!

A few things to keep in mind:
1) This is a Bring Your Own Alcohol event. Mixers will be available; however, 
if you anticipate that you will need mixers other than sodas, bloody mary 
mix, or juice (and ice and limes and lemons...) please let me know today.
2) The party hostess would like everyone to drink responsibly. If you 
anticipate you will be consuming large amounts of "cheer", please bring a 
pillow and blanket (sorry, I don't have enough), or plan on taking a cab 
to/from the party. BE SAFE!
3) Finally, DIRECTIONS:
I am located on Naito Pkwy/Front Ave south of the Broadway Bridge and north 
of the Steel Bridge. I'm in the wonderfully colorful orange-red/yucky-green 
apartments across from the red apartments.
 Get on to Front Ave/Naito Pkwy (if you don't know how, look at a map or give 
me a call)
 From Front/Naito going NORTH: go underneath the Steel Bridge and over the 
railroad tracks. My apartment is on the left.
 From Front/Naito going SOUTH: go underneath the Broadway bridge. My 
apartment is to the right.
 Park at a meter. =)
 My building number is 815. Dial 214 on the callbox to be buzzed in.
 [Alternate entrance: walk up the stairs next to the leasing office. My 
apartment (back entry) is the THIRD patio on the right.]

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
G
