Dear Real-Time,

I'm researching a purchase from Puget Sound that was made on 10/17/00 HE 20 
for 20 MW @ $115.00 per MW.  EnPower is showing a deal with 34 MW at HE 13 
that was partly routed from CALPX, but nothing for HE 20.  We've been told by 
Puget Sound that the deal was done real-time and that the Puget trader was 
Lisa.  Please help me get this resolved.  If any of you recognize this, 
please let me know. Please check your trader's log as well. 

Thanks,

Virginia   x 8981
