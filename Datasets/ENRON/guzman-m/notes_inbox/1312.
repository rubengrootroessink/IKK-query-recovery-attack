19:05 GMT 21 December 2000 *DJ Calif PUC OKs PG&E Issuance Of $2B In
Long-Term Debt

Issuance To Fund $4.5B Undercollections
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--The California Public Utilities Commission Thursday
swiftly granted Pacific Gas and Electric Co.'s request to issue up to $2
billion in long-term debt to finance undercollections of wholesale power
costs.
The PG&E Corp.(PCG) unit has undercollections totalling $4.5 billion as it
is unable to pass high wholesale electricity costs to customers due to a
rate freeze. The utility has filed a request with the PUC to end that rate
freeze and allow rate hikes.
In its application, Pacific Gas and Electric said the size of its
undercollection made it difficult to obtain short-term debt, and that
long-term debt issuance was therefore necessary, the PUC said.
The PUC decision also allows the utility to use $370 million of the $2
billion for other purposes if those funds are not needed to finance
undercollections. It was not immediate clear what other purposes those funds
could be used for, however.
PG&E's request for perpetual authority to issue $2 billion in long-term debt
was denied.
