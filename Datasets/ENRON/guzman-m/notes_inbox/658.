I Just wanted to give you the latest info. on checking out with BPA each hour 
for Grays Harbor Paper.  As of Friday afternoon, 3/16, BPA has assured me 
that both their hourly check out desk, and the control room operators (for at 
night and over the weekend), are on board with this process.  So please call 
the hourly check out desk each hour at 360-418-2277, and let them know what 
Grays Harbor Paper produced for the last hour.

You will not receive a call from Grays Harbor Paper each hour.  Les has 
agreed with them that they will only call the Enron real-time desk if there 
is a change in the preschedule.  So if you don't hear from the Mill, then you 
can assume that the prescheduled number is what they are producing.

If you have any questions please contact Les or myself.

Thanks,
Stan
