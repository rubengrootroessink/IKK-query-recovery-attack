Hey guys, I'm sorry this is such short notice - Actually my roommate just
threw it on me this morning that we were having the party this soon.  I
obviously was not able to send this to everyone I would like to invite so
feel free to spread the word.
Regardless, here are the details...

It's a cocktail party so the attire is business casual to semi formal.
The date is Saturday, December 2nd.
Entertainment will once again be provided by the band; 8th Ave. Instinct.
(I will be collecting suggestions for a new name for the band :)
Start showing up around 7pm - That's close to when the band will start.
We're thinking more along the lines of an acoustic session this time in an
effort to avoid any Grinch's a.k.a. Pigs.
No cover.  *We're just asking that everyone bring a bottle of their own
boos.*  We'll provide the mixers and some boos of our own.

Here is our address and directions for those of you who did not make it to
the last party...
4802 SW Vacuna St., Portland.   Ph: 503-246-1700
If you're coming from Portland go South on Barbur Blvd. towards Tigard.
Turn Left on to Capital Hwy.  Go up less then 3/4 of a mile (Capital Hwy.
turns into 49th St.) and see 7-11 on right hand side.  Our street is 4 or 5
streets after 7-11, on the left.
Turn Left on to Vacuna St.  (If you get to PCC Sylvania, you've gone too
far.)  Our place is the 4th house on the right side.

I'd love to see all of you there.  We're hoping for a turn-out like our last
party so again, feel welcome to bring whoever.
See you then, if not sooner!
