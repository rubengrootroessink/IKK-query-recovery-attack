"Lets play some ball"

Well, I received a check yesterday and so I was able to reserve us a field 
for practice.  But wait, there's more...instead of having one guy hit and the 
rest of us standing around watching him, this year I actually have set up 
some scrimmages.  So we can actually practice against another team, which 
means I would like to have the majority of our team out there.  Here is the 
schedule:

Sunday April 8th  1:00 PM to 3:00 PM
Sunday April 15th 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM
Sunday April 23rd 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM
Saturday April 28th 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM
All practices/scrimmages are at Westmoreland Park Field #2.  Some of you will 
remember that this is the field that we played at last summer.  Its the one 
next to McLoughlin Blvd (where errant warmup throws would sometimes go) and 
where we got flashed by those heinous girls.  If you need directions or a 
better description (not of the girls), let me know.

This part is a reminder that I still need money from some of you.  Some have 
contacted me to let me know when I can expect a check but I havent heard from 
others.  The sooner I can get the rest of the money the sooner I will be able 
to purchase bats and balls.

As always, please let me know if anyone has questions or comments.  I will 
also be at the batting cages next week, day to be determined, so hopefully I 
will see you out there.  Take it easy.

Chris
