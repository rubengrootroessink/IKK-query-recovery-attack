Hey Guz, sorry we got cut off last night and I didn't call you back.  I had
your number out in my car and I was TOOOOOOOOOOO cold to get out of bed and
get it.  I am excited you are coming to town.  Let me know what time you fly
in on wednesday I would love to come out and meet you and Burns for dinner
in the city one night.  I get off work at 4:30 on wednesdays so that would
be best for me but if I need to come on Thursday i guess I could work that
out too.
I sent my brother an email tonight and let him know that you were coming to
town.  I also gave him your cell phone number but I think your best bet is
to try calling him yourself.  I am sure he would be down to come out and
visit with you and Burns if he doesn't have soccer games with his girl's
team so I guess you will have to wait and seee about that!!
Anyways, glad to hear that all is well with you and I am looking forward to
seeing you again!!
Lots of love, little woody!!!
