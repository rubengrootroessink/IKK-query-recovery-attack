At the website below is the new congestion management proposal.  Sections 
three and four of the proposal pertain to real-time.  I believe it would be 
in our best interest to understand this proposal with regards to SC bids and 
loop flow coordination.  Please take a look at the proposal on the site below 
and provide me with your feedback.

Thank you,
Bill

  ISO Market Participants:

  On Friday, January 26, the ISO's management sent to the ISO
Governing Board our draft Congestion Management Reform proposal for their
information and review.  This document is posted on the ISO web site at
http://www.caiso.com/clientserv/congestionreform.html

  We will let you know more about the CMR process going
forward as soon as details are available.
