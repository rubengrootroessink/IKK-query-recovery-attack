I feel bad but she understands.  I think she might come up and be with me
for thanksgiving.  I have a six day break right around then and I think it
would be good for her to just get away for a while.
Guess what?  I had a couple of dates while I was in LA.  They went very
well and she might come up in December for a weekend!
