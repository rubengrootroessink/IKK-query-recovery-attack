When El Paso gets exercised for replacement  reserves by the CAISO and they 
play the 10 minute ramping games.  Don't call EPE to ramp down their 
generation, if possible run an imbalance and receive the dec prices.  I have 
cleared this with EPE and John Forney.  If something happens to change this 
situation drop me a line.
