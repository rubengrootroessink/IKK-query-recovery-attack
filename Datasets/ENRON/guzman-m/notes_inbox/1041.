>The Rose
>Red roses were her favorites,
>her name was also Rose.
>And every year her husband sent them,
>tied with pretty bows.
>
>The year he died,
>the roses were delivered to her door.
>the card said, "Be my Valentine,"
>like all the years before.
>
>Each year he sent her roses,
>and the note would always say,
>"I love you even more this year,
>than last year on this day.
>
>My love for you will always grow,
>with every passing year."
>She knew this was the last time
>that the roses would appear.
>
>She thought, he ordered roses
>in advance before this day.
>Her loving husband did not know,
>that he would pass away.
>
>He always liked to do things early,
>way before the time.
>Then, if he got too busy,
>everything would work out fine.
>
>She trimmed the stems,
>and placed them in a very special vase.
>Then, sat the vase
>beside the portrait of his smiling face.
>
>She would sit for hours,
>in her husband's favorite chair.
>While staring at his picture,
>and the roses sitting there.
>
>A year went by,
>and it was hard to live without her mate.
>With loneliness and solitude,
>that had become her fate.
>
>Then, the very hour,
>as on Valentines before,
>The doorbell rang, and there were roses,
>sitting by her door.
>
>She brought the roses in,
>and then just looked at them in shock.
>Then, went to get the telephone,
>to call the florist shop.
>
>The owner answered, and she asked him,
>if he would explain, Why would someone do this to
>her, causing her such pain?
>
>"I know your husband passed away,
>more than a year ago,"
>The owner said, "I knew you'd call,
>and you would want to know.
>
>The flowers you received today,
>were paid for in advance.
>Your husband always planned ahead.
>He left nothing to chance.
>
>There is a standing order,
>that I have on file down here,
>And he has paid, well in advance,
>you'll get them every year.
>
>There also is another thing,
>that I think you should know,
>He wrote a special little card...
>He did this years ago.
>
>Then, should ever I find out that he's no
>longer here, that's the card
>that should be sent
>to you the following year."
>
>She thanked him and hung up the phone,
>her tears now flowing hard.
>Her fingers shaking, as she slowly reached to get
>the card.
>
>Inside the card, she saw that
>he had written her a note.
>Then, as she stared in total silence,
>she read what he wrote...
>
>"Hello my love, I know it's been a year since I've
>been gone,
>I hope it hasn't been too hard for you to
>overcome.
>
>I know it must be lonely, and the pain is very
>real.
>Or if it was the other way, I know how I would
>feel.
>
>The love we shared made everything so beautiful in
>life.
>I loved you more than words can say, you were the
>perfect wife.
>
>You were my friend and lover, you fulfilled my
>every need.
>I know it's only been a year, but please try not
>to grieve
>
>I want you to be happy, even when you shed your
>tears.
>That is why the roses will be sent to you for
>years.
>
>When you get these roses,
>think of all the happiness
>that we had together,
>and how both of us were blessed.
>
>I have always loved you and I know I always will.
>But, my love, you must go on, you have some living
>still.
>
>Please...try to find happiness, while living out
>your days.
>I know it is not easy, but I hope you find some
>ways.
>
>The roses will come every year,
>and they will only stop,
>when your door's not answered,
>when the florist stops to knock.
>
>He will come five times that day, in case you have
>gone out.
>But after his last visit, he will know without a  doubt
>to take the roses to the place, where I've instructed him
>and place the roses where we are, together once again.
>
>
>Sometimes in life, you find a special friend;
>Someone who changes your life just by being part of it.
>Someone who makes you laugh until you can't stop;
>Someone who makes you believe that there really is
>good in the world.
>Someone who convinces you that there really is an
>unlocked door just waiting for you to open it.
>
>This is Forever Friendship.
>This is the sacred RED ROSE. You MUST pass this
>rose on to at least 5 people within the hour of
>receiving this rose. After you do, make a wish. If you  =
>you've passed it on, your wish will come true and love
>will come your way shortly. If not your life will stay
>the same as it has always been. (No Threats).
>Just be nice & pass it on....
>
>May we all be loved so much.
>Friend , If I don't get this back I can take a hint!
>How many people actually have 8 true friends?
>Hardly anyone I know! But some of us have all
>right friends and good friends!!!
>
>You have been Tagged by the YELLOW bird!
>Which means you are a great friend!!
>
>You will Have Good Luck For Two Years
>if you send this to 8 people or more
>and if this is sent back to you
>then you know that you are a true friend......
>You must send it in 5 minutes or your good luck
