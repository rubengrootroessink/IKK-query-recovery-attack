We have two schedules that are going real time, one has been tagged 
sucessfully and shouldn't need help, EPE-LDWP tag 16178.  The other one had 
the real time tag  denied because they don't want it submitted so early 
(#!#$@#$%)??PNM-LDWP, DELAYED tag 16179.  Please  complete this tag before HE 0200 ?tomorrow morning.??Thanks,??C
