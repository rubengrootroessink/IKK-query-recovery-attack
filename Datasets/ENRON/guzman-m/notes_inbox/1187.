Please show 1 mw to APS from EPE for losses on RT transmission that we used 
on 1/18/01.  This needs to be put in HE 24 MST--that's 23 PST :-)--tonight 
1/22/01. Call APS tranny and confirm with them that you are showing 1 mw 
LOSSES for the hour.  Please send me an email letting me know when this is 
done.

Thanks
Jesse
