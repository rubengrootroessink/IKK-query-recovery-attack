> Given today's Order from FERC setting ISO price caps at $250 MWh for the

> a load differentiated cap null and void, we have ceased efforts to
> implement the October 26th motion.

> Prior to today's Order, the ISO had been working internally and with
> vendors on implementation details. Also, a conference call was held with
> Market Participants on October 30th to assess their implementation needs.
> Based on this initial work, it appeared that implementation could occur in
> early January 2001 but this work is being stopped as a result of today's
