Thought you would enjoy this one...
Two guys from  Oregon State University die and wake up in hell.
The next day the devil  stops in to check on them and sees them dressed
in parkas, mittens and  bomber hats warming themselves around the fire.
The devil asks them, "What  are you doing? Isn't it hot enough for you?"
The two guys reply, "Well, you  know, we're from Oregon, the land of
rain and ice and cold. We're just happy  for a chance to warm up a little
bit.? "The devil decides that these  two aren't miserable enough and turns
up
the heat.? The next morning he  stops in again and there they are, still
dressed in parkas, hats and  mittens. The devil asks them again, "It's
awfully hot
down here. Can't you  guys feel that?"
Again the two guys reply, "Well, like we told you  yesterday, we're from
Oregon, the land of rain and ice and cold. We're just  happy for a
chance to warm up a little bit, you know."
This gets the  devil a little steamed up and he decides to fix the two
guys. He cranks the  heat up as high as it will go. The people are
wailing and screaming  everywhere. He stops by the room with the two
guys from Oregon State and  finds them in light jackets and hats,
grilling sausage and drinking beer.
The devil is astonished, "Everyone down here is in abject misery, and
you two seem to be enjoying yourself."
The two from Oregon State reply,  "Well, ya know, we don't get too much
warm weather up there in Oregon. We've  just got to have a cook-out
when the weather's this nice."
The devil is  absolutely furious; he can hardly see straight. Finally he
comes up with the  answer. The two guys love the heat because they have
been cold all their  lives. The devil decides to turn all the heat off in
hell.
The next morning,  the temperature is below zero, icicles are hanging
everywhere, people are  shivering so bad that they are unable to wail,
moan and gnash their teeth.
The devil smiles and heads for the room with the two from Oregon State.
He finds them back in their parkas, bomber hats, and mittens. They are
jumping up and down, cheering, yelling and screaming like mad men.
The  devil is dumbfounded, "I don't understand. When I turn up the heat,
you're  happy. Now it's freezing cold and you're still happy. What is
wrong with you  two?
The men look at the devil in surprise, "Well, if hell froze over, that
must
mean the Beavers are going to the Rose Bowl!"

Go Beavs!
