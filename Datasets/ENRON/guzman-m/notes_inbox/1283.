Hi Guys,

I'm sending this to you as an FYI because your names were on the deals I had 
to fix.  We have two transmission deals with Snohomish PUD (see 469770.1 and 
469791.1) that were entered under the Snohomissup counterparty.  When 
searching for the counterparty in the listing, please be extra careful about 
the one you actually choose.  If the wrong counterparty is added (even if 
it's the same customer, just a different moniker, as in this case), it will 
send someone (usually me or Virginia) on an unnecessary wild goose chase.

Not hollering, just asking you to be careful.

Caroline
