> Sometimes the news can't wait until Friday. This is a special E-Clips News
> Flash on the Civil War and the Beavers' bowl game possibilities. This
> week's regular E-Clips will be delivered to your email box on Friday.
>
> The Beavers are 9 and 1 and this year's Civil War has huge bowl game
> implications! Not coincidentally, the game has been sold out since the
> summer.
>
> If you aren't going to be able to be in the stands, but still want to be
> around fellow Beaver Believers while you watch the game on TV, the Oregon
> State University Alumni Association has arranged for several official
> televised locations around the country. The details can be found here:
> http://alumni.orst.edu/CivilWar
>
> As far as the bowl game goes, we know two things:
> The Beavers will be in a bowl game.
> That bowl game will not be in Hawaii.
> As more information becomes available, the Alumni Association staff wants
> to be able to distribute the information as quickly as possible to anyone
> who is interested. To that end, we have developed a web site and an email
> update system that will allow us to keep everyone up-to-date. You can sign
> up to receive the updates at this web site: http://bowlgame.orst.edu/
