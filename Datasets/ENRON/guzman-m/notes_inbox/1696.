Did you know that a $35 donation enhances the social functioning and language 
skill of 10 low-income, elderly individuals who are primarily non-English 
speaking Chinese residents?  United Way funds several programs at the Chinese 
Service Center, including senior services that help Chinese elders access and 
use community resources to receive needed support.  It is one of many United 
Way -funded agencies that provide this type of service.

A have exists in Southeast Portland for Chinese-American and 
Vietnamese-American residents seeking to adapt to life in a new country while 
maintaining ties to their rich cultural heritage.  The United Way-funded 
Chinese Service Center provides older immigrants with ethnic meals, English 
lessons, tai chi instruction, tips for adapting to life in the United States 
and much more.  Shyness and language barriers prevent many elderly Asians 
from obtaining the services they need, whether it is something as essential 
as proper health care or something as basic as assistance with their grocery 
shopping. 

The Chinese Service Center has expanded its services to meet increasing needs 
since it opened in 1983.  Soon, they hope to open a branch office in 
Beaverton to serve a growing Asian population there.
