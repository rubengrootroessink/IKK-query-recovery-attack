Group,

We will be selling or buying length for EES each day going forward for market 
price -$5.  ST-Cali will leave us the length (or the short amount) in EES2, 
we will then sell (or buy) as much of this energy as we can.  The deals need 
to be put in the inc sheet,  EES will get the price -5.  We will then need to 
put the mws sold and the price they were sold at (-$5) in a summary sheet.  
The summary sheet should then be sent to Neil Bresnan at EES each morning 
(just like the EPE model).  The EES summary spread sheet is in 
M:/Electric/West/Real-Time/EESFeb01
EES will provide us with a price number they do not want to go below, but 
otherwise try to maximize the value of their energy.

In Enpower we will buy from Enron Energy Services (forward) and sell to the 
counterparty (forward) under our book. In Caps, do the SC to SC interchange 
like normal, then dec or inc EES2 load in SCE1.

If you have questions, please ask me.

Bill
