Group,

Last night we flowed energy out of the Alberta Power Pool.  We picked this 
energy up at the BC border, used SNOPUD network to take it to Mid C, and sold 
it for a nice profit to WWP.  Congrats to Jesse and Guzman for getting it 
done.
I have set up two accounts with BPA that might be of use to us in working 
with Enron Canada regarding the Alberta Power Pool.  
The first account is from the BC Border to Malin.  This account is non-firm 
on the network and non-firm on the malin intertie.  It is the same type of 
product we use from Hotsprings down to Malin.  The North-South account number 
is #682485.

I have also set up an account going South-North from the Caiso to BC Hydro at 
the BC border.  This is non-firm on the Malin intertie and non-firm on the 
network.  This account will allow us to flow north from the southwest through 
California and take energy to either PowerX or the power pool.  The 
South-North account number is #682781.

Additionally, there has been concern over selling a non-firm transmission 
contingent product.  Remember you can buy spinning reserves(call option) and 
then sell that energy as firm if you would like.

If you have any questions please let me know.
Bill
