Guz, just let me know what your plans are as time get closer and we will
have to meet up.  Tell BUrns to get his butt in gear and plan out a night on
the town.  Since I have only been home for a short while I am not totally
familiar with the city night life yet but I am sure Burns knows where to go.
  Polyesters I heard is a great place to rally at but I don't know what
nights are good there.  And I am going to have to work early in the morning
so I will not be part taking in the binge drinking that normally occurs.  I
am down to have a drink or two to be social and head out back home that
night. So just keep me posted!!!

lots of love, kim
