If you can't tell, I'm trying to get you to come back at me...  I hope you
don't think I'm being serious.

Why would you need to come back?  You're the one always ripping on your
friends for never wanting to hang out with any chicks!!  I wasn't meaning
that towards you  But if you feel like making some sort of weak ass attempt
at making fun because you still think I'm a freekin' lesbian then go right
ahead!

I thought of a great comeback for that one but since I haven't heard from
you in a while I am going to be nice
