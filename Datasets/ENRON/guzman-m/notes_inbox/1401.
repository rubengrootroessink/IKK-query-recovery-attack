We will not be selling energy OOM until further notice.    We have no solid 
information concerning refunds,  so even if we sold for a loss to the ISO,  
in an attempt to help,   we could be subject to refunds.
That's exposure with no upside.   

Dont do it.    We could send supplemental bids,   but we would only receive 
$250, which is below the bilateral market.    
Any bids submitted in excess of $250 must be supported and reported to the 
ISO, FERC, and the Cal Energy Oversight Board.   
While we feel that we can support our prices,   we do not want to open up the 
possibility of refunds.

We would like to help,  but it cannot happen in this environment.
