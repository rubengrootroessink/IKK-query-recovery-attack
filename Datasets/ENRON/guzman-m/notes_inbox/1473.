At approximately 5:00pm Tice Electrical will be shutting down partial power 
in the first two rows of the trading floor. Anything plugged into the orange 
colored outlets will not be affected, however any workstations, monitors, or 
anything else not plugged into the orange outlets will lose power for about 
15-20 minutes. The two Real Time desks will not be affected with any power 
loss but it's possible other workstations within these two rows might lose 
power. If anyone is still in the office and working you will receive fair 
warning before the outage takes place. Everyone in the first two rows 
(excluding real time) please shut down your computer before leaving tonight. 
If you have any questions please contact myself or Debra Davidson. Thanks,  
Chip Cox
