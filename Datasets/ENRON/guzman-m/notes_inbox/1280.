:We are going forward with our work for Enron Canada.  We will be doing 
energy restatements and submissions on the weekends and off peak hours. We 
will be responsible from 1700 PST through 0700 PST on weekdays and 24 hours 
on weekends and holidays.  Enron Canada will be communicating with us through 
the west.realtime inbox in our Lotus Notes.  If you do not already have this 
inbox, please add it immediately!  Transalta will also be contacting us 
concerning unit rerates through this inbox.  Currently, the website is only 
accessible through my computer. Please use my computer for evening and 
weekend restatements and resubmissions.  The password for my screen is on my 
desk.  There is a workbook that walks you through the restatement and 
submission process.  You will find copies of the needed information in your 
inbox.  The basic process is:
1.) Check availability information at west.realtime(You will need to have 
your email set to notify you when new mail appears!)
2.) Call Transalta and confirm change and reason for change, determine ETR 
for unit if possible
3.) Note changes in Power Pool Dispatch Log next to Trade App.
4.) Call John Zufferli or Bill Greenhizen 
5.) Submit a revised submission to the Power Pool
6.) Confirm revised submission with the Power Pool

That should be it.  The workbook takes you through the process of revising or 
creating submissions, step by step.  The master document is on my desk and 
offers troubleshooting tips. Additionally we will be looking to take 
advantage of RT opportunities coming out/going into California.
