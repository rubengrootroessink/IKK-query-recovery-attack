When entering a supplemental deal to sell or buy energy for a service 
customer with a profit sharing arrangement, we need to enter that service 
customer as the counterparty in CAPS, and then when the customer is the 
counterparty in CAPS, the price MUST be zero(or subtract transmission and/or 
scheduling fee) in Enpower.  If we buy the energy outright from our service 
customer (such as with CRC), then we enter ECTRT as the counterparty in CAPS, 
and input the appropriate price to pay the service customer in Enpower.  If 
we enter the service customer as the counterparty in CAPS and also enter a 
price greater than zero in Enpower to buy from that customer, we do NOT 
receive the revenue from California AND we pay the customer the fixed price.  
Everyone needs to understand this.  IF you have any questions, please ask me, 
or a senior member of the group.

If you have other questions concerning physical or financial aspects of RT 
please ask me or bring them to the meeting.
