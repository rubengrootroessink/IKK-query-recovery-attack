For your information,

Two temporary employees in West Power Trading, Tom Pinit (Receptionist) and 
Alan Baumbusch (Clerk), have left Enron for employment more closely related 
to their fields of endeavor.  They did a good job for us while they were at 
Enron and we wish them well.

Two new employees, Erin Hall and Diana Stocker, are both from OfficeTeam, and 
they just recently joined us.  They will be sharing the receptionist and 
clerk duties.  Please don't hesitate to introduce yourself--Erin and Diana 
are anxious to learn everyone's name and provide outstanding support.

If you have any questions, please contact me.
