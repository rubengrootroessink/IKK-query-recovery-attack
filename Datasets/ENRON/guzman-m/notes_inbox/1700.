Did you know a $96 donation provides two school-age youth access to programs 
that foster resiliency by developing caring relationships, demanding high 
expectations, and providing opportunities to participate in family, school, 
and civic life?  The United Way-funded Youth Development Program at the Boys 
& Girls Clubs of Portland Metropolitan Area promotes positive values, useful 
skills and self-esteem.  It is one of many United Way-funded programs that 
help youth achieve success.

Visitors to the Boys & Girls Club in Hillsboro fell youthful energy in the 
air the moment they step through the front door.  Children ages 6 to 12 flock 
to the club each morning during the summer to shoot pool, play air hockey, 
practice kickball and much more.  Youths ages 12 to 18 serve as junior staff 
members, lending a hand to regular staff and retreating to the center's teen 
room when they need a break to chat with their peers.  Club Director Darrin 
Marks explains that the club hosts about 100 students everyday during the 
school year and 200 students daily in the summer.  The club has operated in 
Hillsboro since 1992 and offers a wide variety of programs for kids.  Summer 
sports activities include flag football, soccer, floor hockey, basketball and 
baseball.  Other features at the club include an arts and crafts room, a 
newspaper club, a science club, dance classes, and a Discovery Room with 
several computers donated by Intel.  For a nominal fee, the club provides a 
healthy lunch, a safe place to have fun and exposure to interesting sites in 
the metropolitan area that youth might not see otherwise.  The Hillsboro club 
is just one of eight sites sponsored by the Boys &  Girls Clubs of Portland 
Metropolitan Area.
