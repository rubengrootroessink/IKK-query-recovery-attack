Hello traders!

This e-mail is a request regarding counterparties EES and MPC.

Please pay careful attention to the columns from which you are pulling MW and 
price information when you build the worksheet that we send to EES.  We have 
had some recent discrepancies that could have been avoided if the correct 
information had been sent to EES. 

Also, our checkouts with Montana Power Company are getting out of control.  
We are off with them 9 days, totaling 19 deals for the month of February.  
Many of these discrepancies are from deals that were spoken, but not recorded 
in Enpower nor in the INC sheets.  I understand that we do many deals a day 
with MPC and a few may go un-recorded, but it's getting to be too many.  
Please remember to at least put these deals in your log and in the INC sheets.

One final request is that you state the hour when you make trades by phone.  
Tapes are irrelevant if we play them for the counterparty and there is no 
hour stated.  It also makes it difficult for us to pull tapes when necessary. 

Thanks for your responses to my requests in the past.  If you have any 
questions regarding any of the above, please come see me.

Thanks,

Virginia
