On Tuesday, May 1 we will begin the migration from Lotus Notes to Microsoft 
Outlook.  Your existing emails and folders within Lotus Notes will be 
transferred to Outlook without the loss of any data.

The attached spreadsheet indicates migration date by employee. Training for 
Outlook will be available Wednesday through Friday.  Currently, training 
information is not available, however, we will try to have this information 
to the floor on Monday. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact 
Dave Steiner at ext. 3701.
