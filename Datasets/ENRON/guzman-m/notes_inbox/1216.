Looking into why we were out, I find the following for the WSCC-S region.

Pinnacle to West Wing is now balanced since the transmission is corrected

Palo Verde is long and short increments of less than 1 MW, uncorrectable on 
my end  (Mallory? Jeremy? Can you look into this)

Mead is now only .40 long on HE 24, 

We are long at PV,  4 mw HE 23,  9 mw HE 24,  our length is EPE and is listed 
in the EPE schedules.  This length will need to be sold, and Bill is aware of 
it.

Thanks,
