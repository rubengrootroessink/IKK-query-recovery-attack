Elk hunt this year is sceduled for Oct. 24-28th.  We're putting in for some
new territory this year and you all could be the first to harvest a nice big
bull.  I'll probably head over on wednesday or thursday night and hunt
through the weekend.  Hsu, no sidehill walking this year, unless there's a
bucket of rice over there.  Guzman, you missed it last year so I'm counting
on you to be the first elk hunter in history to walk around in a big-ass
sombrero with a side-shooter and a bottle of mezcal. Marcus, I don't give a
shit what you do.  Does anyone know if theres a Beaver game that weekend?
