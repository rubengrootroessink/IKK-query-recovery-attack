Just a reminder - Benefits enrollment for 2001 has started.  You have until 
3:00 pm on October 22, 2000 to make any changes to your benefits.  
By now, you should have received the details of open enrollment at your home 
address. 

If you do not have any changes to your benefits, you do not need to do 
anything and you will automatically be re-enrolled in your current coverage. 

OR

If you have changes that you need to make, you can do so by calling Benefits 
on Call at 1-800-425-5864 or by enrolling via The Enrollment System at 
www.Enron.BenefitsNow.com.

Changes for 2001:

QualMed has been eliminated as an HMO choice for 2001 due to increased 
premium costs and low usage.  If you have QualMed and do not change your 
benefits through the open enrollment process, your coverage will 
automatically be defaulted to $1,250 deductible.  

Also, please look at the cost of the different programs closely.  There have 
been significant price increases in some of the HMO plans that are offered.

With regards to filing claims for the year 2000, please note the following 
deadlines.
For medical and dental, the deadline is December 31, 2001 for claims incurred 
in 2000.
For flexible spending accounts, the deadline is April 30, 2001 for expenses 
incurred in year 2000.
The deadline for the vision plan expenses is six months following the date of 
service.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.  

Thanks!
Amy
