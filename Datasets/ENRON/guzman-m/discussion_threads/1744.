We have length again in NP (on-peak) for 04/24/01 and EES long/short in SDG1 
to take care of as well.  There is 25 mws of ST-WBOM length at $266 in 
NP-15...there is also 50 mws of ST-Cali length(50/50 over $266) in NP-15.  
EES2 is alternatively long off-peak and short on-peak in SDG1.  Enpower deals 
need to be made under the appropriate books in NP (buy from imbalance/sell to 
?...) and with a $5 spread as normal for EES.  If you have questions, please 
let me know.

Thank you,

Bill
