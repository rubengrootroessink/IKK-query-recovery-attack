Two very important things for Sunday and Monday.

On Sunday beginning HE 1through HE15 PST we have 10 mws of length for 
Wheelabrator (Martel) in NP-15.  We need to sell this length to another SC, 
increase our gen schedule (if necessary) and enter the SC to SC trade in 
CAPS.  Put a purchase from Wheelabrator in under ST-Whourly and a sale to the 
other SC also under ST-Whourly.  Prices should be flat in Enpower initially, 
then call Chris Foster and see what he wants to do with the margin (likely 
$10-20 for our marketing efforts).

On Monday beginning HE1 through HE 24 PST we have a shaped schedule parked 
with PNM at PV.  Our basis for this energy is $129 off peak, and $179 on 
peak.  My hope is to get this energy to the NW off peak (a wheel or maybe a 
buy/resale with LDWP or MID--call with questions) or import and sell it in 
SP-15.  We are already long in Enpower (#506291), and should make all the 
sales under the ST-SW book(tranny, buy-resales, etc...).  The mw schedule is 
as follows.

HE 1-6 23 MWs
HE 7-15 45 MWs
HE 16  40 MWs
HE 17  35 MWs
HE 18  25 MWs
HE19-22 45 MWs
HE23-24 53 MWs

IF you have any questions please give me a call.
Thanks and good luck!
