Once again, it's time to find out what you think about your work experience=

at Enron and what we can do to help make it better.  That's why we want to=
=20
check your pulse.  In fact, we've changed the name of last year's "Excellen=

Through Communication" employee survey to The Pulse.  We believe The Pulse=
=20
more accurately captures the purpose of the survey.  Your diagnosis will he=

In last year's survey, you identified several problem areas regarding=20
internal communications and we've already acted on many of your=20
recommendations.  These are a few of the things we've accomplished or are=
=20
working on in direct response to your input:
1. Require all executives (VP and above) to attend the Executive Impact &=

Influence course, which is a 360-degree program designed to improve=20
leadership and communication skills.  By year-end, more than 90 percent wil=
l=20
have attended this course, with the remaining 10 percent to be trained in t=

first quarter of 2001.
2. Offer all employees online communication courses.  These courses will be=

available in the first quarter of 2001.
3. Improve our online communication tools, beginning in the fourth quarter,=
=20
2000:
   w Simplify and standardize Enron directories
