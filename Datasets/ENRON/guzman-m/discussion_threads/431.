I made a new fatboy sheet that should fit all our customers profile. The 
template is in the new folder P\RealTime\Fatboy\Fatboysheet Template.
Hopefully this can limit the number of different sheets we currently are 
using. I put it in the P drive as it is local and will limit our dependency 
on terminal server.
