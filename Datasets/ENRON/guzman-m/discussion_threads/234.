Hey Mark
I hesitated in calling you at work but the credit collection agency said
that if we didn't commit to pay something today, then they would write off
the entire amount as a bad debt, which would have permanently  impacted
both of our credit histories.   Apparently, they are only allowed to keep
delinquent accounts for six months on their books before write-off and your
last payment was end of March.     The guy on the phone said that they were
calling all of Oregon to get hold of you and even called Washington Mutual
and the frat house.   Someone at the frat house said you may have moved to
southern california.   Then, they finally got my house by calling
information after calling several other Guzman's in Orange County.

This will work out as soon as we get current on the account.    I told them
to deduct $600 from my back account and he agreed to post-date the payment
in two weeks.   I also explained the death in our family and he said it
will not permanently hurt our credit history, other than showing we were
late several months.   There is no need to write a letter and you can pay
me when you get the insurance check.

My girls also fly in for the week on Sunday about 1pm.    Plan on coming
over for dinner about 5:00 since we'll all be there anyway.   Let me know
if you need a ride from the airport.
Love ya and go beavs!
Dave
