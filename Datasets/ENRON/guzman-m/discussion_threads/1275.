There have been many occasions where individuals have not saved the model at 
the end of the day.  This means that the last one...two...FIVE hours are not 
updated.  I then have to go back and enter the data off the historical 
scrapes as well as the actual econ deals themselves.  You can imagine how 
frustrating this is for me......   It's VERY EASY to save the model and time 
consuming to update it all after the fact.  Besides annoying me, it also 
looks bad to EPE when they get a model that is wrong.  Do not forget to 
save!!!!!!  It is completely sloppy and totally unacceptable.  Save and save 
often.......
