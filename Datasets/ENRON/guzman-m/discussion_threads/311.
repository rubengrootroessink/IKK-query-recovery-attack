Guz,

We're having a shindig on the 16th of December and I need your address to
send out an official invitation with directions and all that jazz.

Hope all is well and drop me a line when you get the chance.
Forward this to Sully if you have his email as I can't find his address
anywhere.

Thanks and talk to you later,
-Boyd
