Group,

The EES Summary Sheet is in P/Realtime/EES/Month01/Date.  A new copy of this 
sheet must be made every day. This summary sheet MUST be sent to Neil Bresnan 
at EES each morning.  Going forward, copy me when you send this to Neil 
Bresnan.  Maintaining and sending this sheet is the duty of the team member 
running EPE.  

Bill
