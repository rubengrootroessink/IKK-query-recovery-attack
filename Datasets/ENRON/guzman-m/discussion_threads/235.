CRC has a view that expost prices are going to be low for certain hours today 
and wants us to put in dec bids to pull energy out of the ISO under these 
conditions:

HE   13-16, 23-24
Volume   25 MW
Bid price  $0
Tiepoint  LC1
Scheduling Fee  $5 per MWh

If he is awarded give Bill Miller a call.  Also
