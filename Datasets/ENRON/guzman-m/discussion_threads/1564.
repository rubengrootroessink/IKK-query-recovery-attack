That's so cool that your sister finally came up!  What did she think of
Portland in general?  How are her and Jay doing?
I've been pretty good.  Keeping busy with work, babysitting, what not.  I'm
house sitting for my boss David Ho this whole week and watching his 7 year
old son Zack.  I take Zack to school in the mornings and pick him up after
work and then we just hang for the rest of the evening.  He's really a cool
kid.  Very disciplined.  But I don't think he gets much attention from his
parents and I don't think they let him be a kid very much.  So I've been
spoiling him.  We go out to dinner and I let him order whatever he wants.  I
tought him how to play poker last night and we made brownies and he acted as
if it was the coolest, most exciting thing he's ever done.  He kept saying,
"We're having fun!  This is FUN!"  As if having fun and being a kid was some
weird concept.  Tonight we're going to a baseball game and he's stoked about
that cause his parents don't let him play sports.  I took him to my
apartment yesterday and he asked my why I lived in a "hotel".  I should have
told him, "Cause your Daddy doesn't pay me enough," but I guess that would
have been bad.
Jesse's band played this last weekend at the Old Market Pub.  Mom and Kurt
came and my Dad came too.  My Dad ran the sound board and he was so stoked!
He was so excited that Jesse wanted to involve him like that.  Mom & Kurt
just got back from visiting my sister in Amsterdam.  They took a road trip
to Paris and my Mom broke her foot while they were there so they had to see
Paris from the car. She's wearing a huge, purple cast.  But she's ok.  She's
got a little cast shoe so that she can walk on it without crutches.  We got
all fucked up when the band played and she was dancing all night on it.
I guess that's it.  Looking forward to the nice weather.  I love Portland in
the Spring and Summer, it puts me in the best mood!  Going down to LA in
July for business.  If you happen to be there by chance, we'll have to
party.  Don't worry, no Kristen!!!
Are things going well with you?  How's work?  How's life in general?

Hey, sorry I didn't write you back sooner however I had a six day break.
Anyway,  ST Pattys day was a blast, Dahl and Pat and I started drinking
around 10am and by the time the night was over we had been to 10 different
bars, (got kicked out of two)  met up with a ton of people and had an
overall blast.  I was so hating it the next day.   My sister was up from LA
this weekend.  We had a really good time.  Went to Touche and the Gypsy on
Thursday, went to the Blazer game and then Scooters.  On Saturday night we
went to the Kennedy School, and on Sunday we went to Multnomah Falls and
took her to Beaches for lunch.  She had a really good time and it was nice
to have her up for the weekend.  Anyway, how is everything with you?
