LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--California Gov. Gray Davis is considering a number
of steps to repair the state's flawed deregulated wholesale electricity
market, including banning the export of power from the state, according to a
draft report.
The two-paged draft, titled "Options Regarding California Electricity: For
Discussion Purposes Only," is being circulated by the governor's office to
lawmakers and energy officials, sources close to the issue said Wednesday.
The document, obtained by Dow Jones Newswires, details steps the state could
take to fix its troubled wholesale power market. All of the items in the
draft were under consideration, including a return to regulated markets,
said Steve Maviglio, the governor's press secretary.
Maviglio said Davis will announce some details of his energy plan Friday,
the deadline for the governor to reply to the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission's proposals for repairing the state's power markets.
One proposal that the governor is expected to adopt is to develop a state
power authority to build power plants and own and operate transmission
systems, the source said.
Among the ideas under consideration are the following:
-Eliminate the California Independent System Operator, manager of one of the
state's two wholesale power markets and much of its power grid.
-Extend the freeze on retail electricity rates charged by Edison
International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison and PG&E Corp. (PCG)
unit Pacific Gas & Electric Co.
-Require utilities to retain existing generation and to build new power
plants.
-Consider re-asserting state authority over the operation, maintenance and
safety practices of all in-state generating facilities for public health and
safety purposes.
-Authorize California's publically held utilities to purchase the majority
of their power in forward markets.
-Pressure the FERC to "do its job" by imposing a regional price cap on
wholesale energy that varies by time of day and year.
-Continue to lobby for billions of dollars in refunds for "unjust and
unreasonable" rates charged to California consumers.
