Subject:  Prescott Case

This is interesting - the other side of the story.  Those Beavs aren't such
bad boys!  -K




Interesting reading from someone calling himself "Grackle" on the Beaver
Dam at Beaver Sport Central.  Here's what he had to say regarding the
Prescott
trial:

I've attended much of the trial and here are the pertinent facts:

1. Victor Becerra, the accuser/victim: (a) lied about how much he drank
that night-- for example he told the attending doctor at Good Sam (where he
had
his battered face treated) that he'd had half a beer that night. He also
told the grand jury that he'd had "at most a beer" before going over to
the party where the fight occurred. In fact, witnesses testified that he'd
one
beer AND consumed at very potent mixed drink (a "consuelo")-- a consuelo
(Corey here, El Presidente' makes the best consuelos in Corvallis)
consists of SIX shots of vodka mixed with juice or the like.

2) Becerra also lied about not having struck any blows. Not only did he
strike blows, he struck FIRST and suffered the consequences. First,
Becerra pushed Prescott after telling him that he and his "boys"
(Prescott's
friends at the party-Junior Addams, Newsom, Weathersby) were't welcome at
the
party-Prescott then decked him AFTER more less pawing at Becerra twice to
get him out of his face (in between Prescott's mild pawing at Becerra,
Becerra taunted him by telling Prescott he hit like "a bitch").
Subsequently, things died down for a minute or so, and then Becerra
proceeded to ambush a VERY drunk Addams who, at that time, was bending
down to fix his shoe (previously, Addams had not been involved in any
physical
confrontation). Just exactly what did Becerra do to Adams? He grabbed him
by the head and kneed him in the face-knocking Adams down and splitting his
lip. Then, all hell broke loose-with many people fighting each other and
with Becerra getting the worst of it -- kicked and punched. ALL of these
facts are in the testimony from reliable witnesses and the DA doesn't even
deny any longer that Becerra was the aggressor.

3) My conclusion: First, Becerra only got what he asked for by kneeing
Adams in the face with no provocation from Addams. The fact that Addams'
friends
beat the heck out of Becerra for the cheapshot was the risk Becerra took
for cheapshotting Adams in the first place. Charges should NEVER have been
brought (the thing was a brawl started by Becerra), but since they were,
why wasn't Becerra charged with assault as well?

4) A coach today told me that this case has already hurt recruiting-the
word's out that Corvallis will go after blacks and prosecute them before
running a really thorough investigation. I agree-this case should NEVER
have been prosecuted and since it was, why weren't the non-blacks involved
charged as well?? This is something we all need to be concerned about. I
intend to write the District Attorney (Heiser) expressing my opinion on
the matter.
