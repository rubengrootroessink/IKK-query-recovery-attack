FYI,
We have replaced several printers and added 2 new color printers "Newport & 
San Diego". Printers Catalina and Savannah are out of service until further 
notice. We will continue to replace older printers over the next few days, so 
please be patient as we go through this process.
Please run the "NTPrint" icon on your desktop to get the latest changes.

Thanks,
Mike
