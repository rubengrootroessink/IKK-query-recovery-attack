I got the first half schedule over the weekend and wouldnt you know it but I 
forgot to bring it with me to work.  However, I do have the days and times, 
the locations will follow, whenever I remember to bring it with me.
Tuesday May 1 at 9:45 PM
Tuesday May 8 at 7:15 PM
Tuesday May 15 at 7:15 PM
Monday May 21 at 9:00 PM
Monday June 4 at 9:00 PM
Again, this is only the first half, there will be a two week break after the 
last game to make up any rainouts, then another 5 games will follow.  We are 
in the "F" league, last year we were in the "I" league.  But we fear no team, 
they better bring their "A" game!  Also, all games will be at either Delta 
Park or at Farragut Park.  We played at Farragut a few seasons ago, its in N. 
Portland and I will have detailed directions for you.  Another reminder, last 
practice is this Saturday at 1PM at Westmoreland.  Thanks to those that 
showed up yesterday.  I will be checking playoff schedules to see who is 
playing on this Saturday to head off any potential "excuses".  Questions, 
comments, concerns, let me know.  Take it easy.
Chris
