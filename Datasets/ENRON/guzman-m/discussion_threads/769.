             The Top 15 New U.S. Army Weapons for 2001


15> The Britney Spear -- A deadly assault weapon with razor sharp,
    retractable twelve inch nipples which reduce men to drooling
    idiots.

14> R-23 Multi-Environment Inhalation Assistance Device for
    Short-Term, Repeatable Infantry Stimulus -- Okay, it's
    actually just a $750 crack pipe.

13> RoboReagan -- Oh, come on.  Did you *really* think he was
    hospitalized for a broken hip?

12> The Heche Bomb -- Rather than killing countless civilians like
    its thermonuclear predecessor, detonation of this warhead
    simply bewilders the enemy by wandering amongst them, knocking
    on their doors and making strange remarks.

11> Compassionate Carbine -- Kills just as effectively, but a
    small sound chip in the stock says, "I'm sorry" with each
    bullet fired.

10> Ultra Anthrax Plus -- Similar to regular Anthrax, but with
    a hint of lemon for a clean, refreshing scent!

 9> Sharkbomb -- Fills the target area with thousands attorneys,
    leaving it bogged down by legal haggling.

 8> Army of One -- Pvt. First Class Frank Richards will be
    dispatched to finally eliminate those pesky Iraqis.
    We expect him to be far more effective than a full dose
    of the Army, without all of the unpleasant side effects.

 7> The Atomic Balm -- Deadly Chapstick that comes in three
    luminescent colors:  Irradiated Iraq Indigo, Glowing
    Gorky Green and Malignant Mao Mauve

 6> Land Mimes -- Will repulse, frustrate and anger the enemy;
    now with potent "trapped in a box" mechanism.

 5> "Star Wars" Defense System - Network of ground- and orbital-
    based weapons designed to prevent George Lucas from entering
    U.S. airspace with another lame "prequel."

 4> SHDI (Strategic Hairpiece Defense Initiative) -- Uses
    satellite laser technology to track Sam Donaldson.

 3> Don't Ask Don't Telegraph -- Global communication without
    leaving the closet!

 2> The Subliminable Obsiconfusionary Mispronunciator -- Confuses
    foreign leaders by introducing gibberish into speeches.
    Best of all, it's stealthiable.



 and Topfive.com's Number 1 New U.S. Army Weapon for 2001...


 1> The Lewinsky Land Mine -- Get anywhere near it and it'll
    blow your nuts off.

                      Rumination of the Day

           Human cloning may raise some ethical issues,
              but man, I could really use another me
             in my car to get into that carpool lane.

                           (J. Hutter)
