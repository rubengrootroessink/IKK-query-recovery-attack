Group-

Last night there was a strategy that was implemented that needs some 
clarification.  We bought from EPE at PV and imported to the ISO.  We then 
did an SC trade (internal interchange) with WESCO in SP15.  When we do this, 
we do not want to adjust bid our import. If the import were to be cut due to 
congestion higher than our adjustment bid, we will be subject to replacement 
costs, which may be as much as the highest out of market energy price.  
However, if we send in the import without an adjustment bid, we are subject 
to a maximum of $250 per Mw.  This is potentially a substantial loss, but a 
least it is a known (and manageable) downside. In order to mitigate this risk 
of congestion, we can run a wheel in at Four Corners (with bid at $200) and 
out at Palo Verde (with bid of $150).  With both the import and the wheel for 
congestion relief, any congestion will be a wash and our only downside will 
be our transmission from PV to FC.

If this does not make complete sense, let me know and I will try to explain 
it further. 

Cheers
