Subject: Buy/Resells - What We Learned

John,

From our research into Avista and others, here is what we have learned about 
using Buy/Resells:

Whether to select "Buy From" or "Sell To" upon deal entry is determined by 
the ultimate purpose of the BR, as shown here:

Purpose:  
Pay the Customer (sleeve or other service they have provided to EPMI)

Type is Buy From
Pricing is:  Buy = EPMI price
      Sell = Customer price

Charge the Customer (services or other, like transmission recapture)

Type is Sell To
Pricing is:  Buy = Customer price
      Sell = EPMI price

I hope this helps to determine the correct way of entering a buy/resell, and 
will alleviate settlement discrepancies in the future.  If you agree with 
this, feel free to share it with the real time group.  

Caroline
