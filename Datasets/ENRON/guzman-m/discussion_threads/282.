Good morning,

Please see the email below from Keoni Almeida.  It is VERY IMPORTANT for Real 
Time to keep a log of any dispatches or real-time changes made outside of 
ADS.   It is my understanding that a log is being kept.  Volume Management 
needs to know how to access the log as there have been several ADS 
discrepancies.   
Thanks, 
Donna

Hi Heather,  we log dispatches in an electronic logging system called SLIC
(see attached as an example).  This data is transferred into our system.
SCs generally log all RT changes on their side and relay this info to their
settlements folks.  You folks may want to do this also as some of your
disputes are having to do with RT changes that I'm having to pull SLIC logs
and forward to Enron when your folks wouldn't need to bother with a dispute
if you had this logging information on your end.  Hope this helps.

Keoni - when ADS goes down, how are these phone call dispatch instructions
logged at the ISO?
Also how do market participants verify and agree upon instructed mw values
with no data in the ADS system for these verbal instructions?

Thanks for your help,
Heather
