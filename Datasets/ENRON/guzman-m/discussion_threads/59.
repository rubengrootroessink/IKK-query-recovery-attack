November 11th and 12th is the weekend we will plan on going.  I'm going to
leave Eugene on Thursday the 9th at about 4pm and plan to arrive at the
Starkey camp at around 10pm (45 min. south of La Grande).  Can anyone else
get Friday off?  It would be nice to meet at Marcus' place and take one
vehicle (an Explorer?).  If you plan to hunt then you'd better get your
hunting license and tag (Rocky Mountain Elk, second season) real soon.  I
plan to hunt Friday, Saturday, and Sunday and head for home on Sunday the
12th about noon.  We should be back in Portland by 5pm.  Hope you guys don't
flake out.  Papa Wilson bought a nice big canvas tent and wood stove so were
going in style this year.  You will need warm clothes.  Preferably wool
because you don't want anything that makes noise, like nylon.  Call me if
you need some options.  Also a warm sleeping bag and don't use any scents
before you come over (shampoos, soaps, deoderants) as the Elk have great
smell.
