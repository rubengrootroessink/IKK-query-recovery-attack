I set up a deal with Riverside where we can give them SP15 and they will give 
us back NOB. They will do this for us for $30. They have capacity to do this 
HE9-22 on Peak days. HE 1-8 and 23-24 they have no capacity due to 
commitments to BPA.

They said they are prepared to do this on a regular basis with us if it 
works. The deal is transmission contingent and they will pay us back in 
physical power at NOB a later date. This was their suggestion, as this is 
what worked best for them.  It also limits a lot of our risk and downside as 
the NW lately has always  traded at a premium to SP. 

At NOB take it to Snohomish and back down to Malin. Ryan set up the Account 
numbers with BPA and it is  #794811    (Our Firm from NOB-BIG EDDY, and Non 
firm BIG EDDY to Snohomish) and we also have Snohomish to the ISO which is # 
882409.
