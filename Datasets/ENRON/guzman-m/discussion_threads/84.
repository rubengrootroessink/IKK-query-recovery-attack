We should see if we could set up the loop this weekend going from 4C to NP15. 
Here is a new possibility for a loop that is available most days. I tried to 
set it up Friday but came back and said there was no room after telling me 
all day there was room on the line.  Here is the recipe: 

Pac Trannie from 4c to Gonder. 
SPP Trannie from Gonder to Summit. (SPP's trannie desk is 775-834-3909).
ISO import at summit. 

There is supposedly 25-30 MW room on the Gonder-Summit line. The price is 
$6.90. 
I think this can be a great alternative for the loop through IPC or MPC. I 
was not able to schedule any of those two lines today because everything 
going north is full.
