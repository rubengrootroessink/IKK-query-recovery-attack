Group-

There is a new "FIX" for the Enpower to PX Report.  Due to the latest version 
of the trade app, the templates that we export and upload into CAPS need to 
be modified prior to uploading.  The templates now contain ";;" when they 
need to have ";0;".  So the temporary fix is to go into the template and 
manually enter the 0's where they are missing.

The procedure should be as follows:

1.  export th file to A:\\ as usual

2.  save the file to O:\\ Portland\WestDesk\California Scheduling\PX Final 
Schedules\Final Schedules as usual

3.  Open the file from the O:\\ drive and locate all consecutive 
semi-colons.  There should be a zero between them.  The easiest way to do 
this is the replace function.  In the search menu, select "replace".  In the 
"find what:" boxe, place ;; and in the "replace with:" box type ;0;   Then 
choose "Replace all" two times.  Save the file and you're done.

4.  Upload the file into CAPS as usual.

This should prevent the problems we have been having with the upload and keep 
Brett happy.  Pete Davis is aware of the problem and we shouldn't have to do 
this for long....

Thanks guys.
Jesse
