Hey,

I just wanted to let you know there were three people who were responsible 
for the changes that Virginia was forced to make for Feb, and you were one of 
them.  As you can see below, the errors included counterparty changes, volume 
changes, deal extensions and even adding missing deals all together.  I'm 
forwarding you this as a STRONG reminder to make sure you have entered 
everything carefully and accurately.  As a group we need to ensure every deal 
is done right from start to finish.  Virginia is getting tired of fixing our 
sloppy mistakes and I am getting tired of hearing about them!

Thanks,
Jesse
