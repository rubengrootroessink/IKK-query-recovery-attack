Thank you to all who participated in our benefit auction at the holiday party 
last weekend.  Donations, auction funds and the Enron match will result in 
$12,000 for two local charities!

This year we are directing our fund-raising efforts to two worthwhile 
community resources:  Portland's Court Appointed Special Advocates program 
(CASA) and the Raphael House shelter for battered women and their children.  
CASA is a non-profit organization that places community volunteers with 
foster children and at-risk youth to ensure their fair treatment in the 
courts.  Raphael House provides a refuge for women and children oppressed by 
domestic violence.

Please make your check payable to CASA or Raphael House, you may evenly 
distribute your donation with a check to each or the total to your preferred 
charity.  For tax purposes, all checks will be sent in by year end.  If you 
were not lucky enough to win a bidding war we will still accept your money 
and remember Enron will match all donations!  All checks should be turned in 
by 12/20/00, I will be out of the office until 12/14/00.  However, if you 
prefer to turn your check in right away, please see Jessica Burry.  We will 
ensure that you receive a receipt from the appropriate charity.

A big thanks to Frank Vickers for his entertainment and charitable efforts, 
he did an awesome job!

Happy Holidays!

Mollie
