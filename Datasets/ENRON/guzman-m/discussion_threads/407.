Per my previous memo Services Desk has a unit contingent sale for the balance 
of the month to WWP. The energy is coming from Willamette and services bought 
transmission from Pac to move from Willamette busbar to BPA System. Then 
Snohomish transmission to move from Pac's system to WWP system. 

The Pac transmission is Firm and is for 10 mw around the clock so any off 
peak energy coming out of Willamette can be sold at the Pac system intertie 
with BPA for no additional charge.

If there are curtailments don't resupply the schedule. Call WWP at 
509-495-8534 then PAC Trans. at 503-251-5230 and Snohomish Trans. at 
425-304-1620 to have the counterparties take the schedule to zero. 

For Enpower the deals are as follows:

WWP Sale         471884
Willemette Buy 471891

In deal scheduling take the affected hours to zero and note that the unit was 
out.

Snohomish Trans. 471938
Pacificorp Trans.   471943

In deal scheduling change the delivery point on Pac. transmission from 
Willamette Busbar to show it delivered at Mid-C. This will allow the 
transmission pieces to be linked together and not cause position manager to 
be out of balance. Since this transmission is take or pay we will be billed 
for the transmission if we use it or not so leave the volume at 10 Mw.

My Willamette contact is Doug Reiner his cell phone is 541-979-3493 his 
office number is 541-926-2281.

I'd like to be called if there are any unit outages or if there are any 
questions. My cell number is 503-807-2826, home is 503-579-1615.
