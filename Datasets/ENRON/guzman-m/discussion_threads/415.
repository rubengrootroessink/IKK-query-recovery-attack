*DJ Calif ISO Seeks Cost-Based Power Contracts Beginning Sat
(MORE) Dow Jones Newswires 12-07-00
1217EST Bids Due 2 P.M. PST Thu
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Faced with a severe power supply deficiency for the
remainder of the year, California's grid operator is seeking short-term,
cost-based electricity contracts that could begin as early as Saturday,
according to documents obtained by Dow Jones Newswires Thursday.
Bids are due 2 p.m. PST (2200 GMT) Thursday, and contracts are expected to
be signed 5 p.m. PST.
The state's Independent System Operator sent a notice to generators
appealing for additional resources equal to 5% of the ISO's projected peak
load for the month of December, according to the notice. The actual number
of megawatts was undetermined. However, market sources put the figure around
5,000 MW.
The ISO is looking for the lowest possible bid.
"Cost-recovery will be limited to verifiable start-up costs, fuel costs,
emissions costs, and an amount equal to the lessor of 10% of production
costs or $25 a megawatt-hour," the notice states.
With 11,000 MW of generation off-line - about one-quarter of the state's
capacity - due to planned and unplanned outages and colder-than-normal
temperatures in the Northwest that limit the amount of power California can
import, the ISO has been forced to go out of market and pay premium rates
for wholesale electricity in order to keep the state plugged in.
