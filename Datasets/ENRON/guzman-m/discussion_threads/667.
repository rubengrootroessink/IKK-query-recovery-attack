If you are entering a deal for Harbor, LV Cogen, Willamette, or Saguaro copy 
a deal from the DEAL TEMPLATE worksheet on the Services Sheet.  These deals 
are coded to show our profits.  Feel free to change any of the cells except 
the BUY PRICE and P L that are highlighted in blue.  These cells have 
formulas that should not be changed.  Make sure that you input the correct 
BASIS price as well.

Thanks,
Holden
