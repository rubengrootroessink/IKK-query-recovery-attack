When taking Williamette  to load,  make sure that we now enter the purchase 
side in Enpower as follows:

ST Hrly
Williamette
Fixed Forward
(5.84) for the fixed price.  There is no place to put an offset in a fixed 
deal.

This replaces the index forward purchase with offset type deals that we have 
entered in Enpower ( the offset was to cover us for transmission 
reimbursement).

The reason behind this is:

Entering a deal as Williamette index  less transport  has been charging our 
desk the  full index expense daily  for this counterparty in Enpower.    
Since CAPS load is scheduled under Williamette,  we had not been receiving 
any revenue for the Calimbalance piece.   There may be other Service 
Counterparties that need to be adjusted.   

This may be confusing to you,  as you all have been putting all Enpower under 
ST W Hrly.     This  much is good.
Just make sure that from now on,  any Service deal going to Real Time gets 
zero fixed  price (unless you have to account for transmission).    This 
keeps expense out of the ST W Hrly book.   Once Volume Management allocates 
California revenue for Williamette,  they speak with Services.  Services 
provides 
the profitability calculation.   An annuity is created, paying these 
counterparties an appropriate amount.

Do you have questions??

There will be a cleanup for Sept, October and November.

Thanks,
JMF
