Operational Risk Management was the topic of an information session held la=
st=20
week for all managers and above in ENW who support trading operations for E=

Steel Origination=20
Since its inception in September, the steel group has grown to over 40=20
people.  They have contacted the majority of the key industry players and=
=20
received positive feedback.  Additionally, the group has executed both=20
physical and financial trades and has 10 products posted on EnronOnline.

Steel prices are at a 20-year low, several large producers have recently=20
filed for bankruptcy protection, and capital is scarce. The industry needs=
=20
both liquidity and price risk management. At this time, Enron is the only=
=20
company offering these products. A middle-market group has recently been=20
formed, which will allow the originators to focus on longer term deals with=

embedded capital. The biggest challenge is bringing the "old economy "=20
incumbents up to speed on derivatives. There may also be some credit issues=

Stay tuned for cash flow and earnings.

GLOBAL FLASH

UK Gas Update
This week the Bacton- Zeebrugge Interconnector surprised the market by=20
switching flow direction from UK Import to Export despite European spot=20
prices being lower than UK prices.  The Interconnector's operating rules=20
allow this to happen at present. Several shippers are lobbying to have thes=
e=20
rules amended to be able to react more quickly to market forces.  This flow=
=20
direction switch coincided with the recent cold snap increasing demand=20
substantially to 430mcm which in turn has resulted in a surge in prompt UK=

prices. =20

EOL activity during this period has been particularly active as we benefit=

from the increased volatility in the market.=20

Enron has several fuel switching options at our Teesside installations whic=

we use to protect our positions.

Fine weather in Japan
Over the New Year, Enron Japan completed a weather transaction with BTM,=20
which acted as a broker to the deal.  The deal, whereby we bought the optio=
n,=20
involved a Jan/Feb average temperature call with a maximum payout of 500 mi=
ll=20
JPY.   The transaction acted as a trigger leading to further transactions. =

While not a major deal financially, this deal is significant as it offers a=
n=20
indication that the Japanese weather market is developing and is growing in=

negotiations. =20
