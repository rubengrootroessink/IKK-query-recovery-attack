hey Mark,
yes, cita had another episode of congestive heart failure.    I'm pretty
sure that they just need to increase the dosage of her CHF medicine since
it was a fairly mild attack.    The good thing was that she noticed her
condition quickly and actually called 911 herself.   They also took her off
an IV within an hour.   We hope that she'll be out of the hospital by
Tuesday but won't know until we talk to the doctor this morning.

I'm leaving to Houston on Tuesday and return on Friday late afternoon.
So, I will not be able to go skiing on Friday.    For Saturday, I
tentatively have a golf date scheduled with Cicero and the Richardson's.
Bob was trying to schedule a few foursomes but will not know until today.
We call it the Superbowl of Golf but actually turns out to be the
Superduffers.    If you are interested in playing, I'll see if he has an
opening for another golfer and you can play in my foursome.

If golf falls through, a day in Big Bear sounds good if the ski conditions
are good.    I'll need to drive up and back the same day.   Karen cannot go
because she is recuperating from her lasik eye surgery and cannot do any
strenuous exercise for a couple weeks.     We can check the weather and
conditions later in the week.

If golf and skiing fall through, then I might take Karen to a museum on
Saturday.    She's been wanting to see a special Egyptian tour that is
actually in Santa Ana through February.   You are welcome to join us if
interested in Egyptology.

No real plans for the superbowl, other that maybe a gathering at my place
and possibly doing the HB 10k run in the morning along the pier.     I'm
not too interested in the game itself but we'd be remiss not to have at
least a small gathering.   So, plan on that if nothing else comes up.

I will not have email access during my trip to Houston.....  so leave
voicemails instead during the next week.
see ya,
Dave
