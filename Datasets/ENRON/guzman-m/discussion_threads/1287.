Hey Guys. 

I had a long talk with NCPA today and set up so that we again can do the 
ZP26/NP15 Buy-Resale on a Realtime basis. We are not doing a profit split 
this time, we are paying them $25/MW instead. This basically enables us to 
shift 21MW across PATH15 and not be subject to Congestion as NCPA has 
Grandfather Rights across the path. This is a sweet strategy when the 
SP15/NP15 spread is there and PATH15 is congested. NCPA's capacity is 21MW, 
but I would not recommend doing more than 20MW. There are others who know 
about this opportunity but are not currently using it (WESCO especially). So 
by doing only  20MW we do not remind them of NCPA. 

The way this works is that we call NCPA and ask their capacity across PATH15. 
And tell them you want to schedule the BR through whatever hour. 

IN CAPS:
We sell to NCPA in ZP26.  
We buy from NCPA in NP15.

We can buy SP15 to fill our ZP26 sale (we just shift the load from SP15 to 
ZP26, so enter a EPMI CALPOOL).
PG&E is NCPA's SC, so if you are not passing Phase two give them a call.



NCPA's tel#: (916) 786-3520
PG&E tel# : (415) 973-1969

If you guys have any questions  just ask me.

Geir
