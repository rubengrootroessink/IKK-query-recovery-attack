Hi Bert,

I will be arriving in Portland on Thursday, May 17th at 10:30am and I will
be staying at the Westin Portland, 750 SW Alder St.. I would like to stop by
the Enron office on Thursday afternoon at about 2PM and meet the Enron crew.


I would appreciate your help in organizing an outing on Thursday evening.
The outing could be to your favorite restaurant or what-so-ever event that
may be nearby. I hope that you and many of your colleagues will be able to
join me on Thursday, May 17th as my guests.

Also, can you please e-mail me directions to your office.

Regards,


Ken Gaizler
