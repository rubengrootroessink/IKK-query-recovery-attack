Hey Guz, just wanted to write and see how your Xmas was?  Mine was good
except that we missed Jason and Emiria over in Holland but we did get a
chance to talk to them.. they are having lots of fun and have been traveling
around Holland and Paris. Did you have to work on Xmas?  I hope not.  Just
wondering if you got my holiday card that I sent to you.  The only address I
had for you was your work one so hopefully it will make it up to you from
the mailroom or something.  I sent some pics in there so hopefully you get
it.  I was great seeing you and Burnsy a couple of weeks ago.  What is the
news on him?  Is he dating that girl that we went out with yet or is she
still living at her ex boyfriends house?
Ricky comes tomorrow and I am so excited.  Things between us have really
sparked again so we will see what happens when he is out here.  This is
always the make it or break it trip after two people have broken up and have
not seen each other.  I hope that things work out but if not everything
happens for a reason.  I am just really excited to see him and hang out.  we
are heading up to Tahoe to gamble on Friday and Sat and then come home on
Sunday to go to the city for new Year's.  It should be a good time but you
know what can happen when people gamble and drink so this will be
interesting!!!
Anyways, hope all is well!!1  Have fun working on New Year's I will be
thinking about you when you sit lonely in your cube!!!
Hahaha!!!Just kidding!!!
Lots of love, KIM
