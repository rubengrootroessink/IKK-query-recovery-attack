>   NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Southern California's air district last week
> ordered AES
> Corp. (AES) to shut down half of its gas-fired units in the area until the
> utility can install emissions-control technology on them, a spokesman said
> Monday.
>   Approximately 2,000 megawatts of generation from 10 units at AES's three
> plants near Los Angeles were closed for exceeding their nitrogen oxide
> emissions
> limits during last summer's energy crunch, said Aaron Thomas, manager of
> government relations for AES Pacific.
>   The units will only run if the ISO calls a stage 1, 2 or 3 emergency,
> Thomas
> added.
>   The utility plans to install emissions-control technology on the 10
> units by
> June 1, Thomas said. AES is in the process of applying for permits now.
>   The 10 other units at AES's three gas-fired plants are equipped with
> NOx-reduction technology and are running at full power, Thomas said.
>   The hearing board of the South Coast Air Quality Management District
> will vote
> on the district's order later this month, Thomas said. The board could
> overturn
> or amend the district's order.
