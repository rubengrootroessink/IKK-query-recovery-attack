You will be compensated for holiday pay under the California Scheduling 
Incentive Plan.    We will require you to fill out a form and the normal 
turnaround time mirrors that of an expense check.   The completed forms will 
be submitted to your HR Rep,  Amy Fitzpatrick.    She will submit for payment.
I will leave a copy of this form in each of your mailboxes.     

If you have further questions,  contact myself,  Bill W or Amy.


Thanks!
