Group,

Just a quick reminder of the process to pay back losses on our John Day to 
COB transmission.  As you know we route the schedules through deal number 
146517.  At the end of the day, we need to aggregate the costs for losses on 
the transmission that is flowed and make an annuity to ST-NW.  The annuity 
should be a purchase from ST-NW by Short Term West Hourly for 1 mw at the 
total cost for the losses for that day.  Then put the annuity number in the 
inc sheet.  Please try to standardize your annuity transactions going 
forward.  
Thanks
Bill
