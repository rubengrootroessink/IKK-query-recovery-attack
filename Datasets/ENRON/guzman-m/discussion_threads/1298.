Group,
Virginia is exactly correct on this point.  MAKE IT A HABIT!  The majority of 
inadvertancy that we have contributed to (and there hasn't been that much) 
has been a result of confusion on times and duration of trades.  
Thanks,
Bill

Dear Real Timers,

As I have been having to pull tapes lately, I cannot stress enough the 
importance of stating the hour for which you are trading when you make 
deals.  It is imperative that you state (as often as possible) the hours that 
you are trading for, and it is extremely helpful when you re-cap the sale at 
the end of your trade!! :) please...

There may be deals that we are going to loose the dispute for because neither 
trader (on either side) stated clearly what hour we were trading for. I'm 
relying on you guys to help me collect 100% on all our trades.

Please see or e-mail me with any questions.

Thanks.

Virginia
