17:22 GMT 30 October 2000 DJ Puget Sound Asks FERC For Price Caps In Western
Region
NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Puget Sound Energy Inc.(PSD) has requested that
federal regulators impose price caps on sellers of wholesale electricity in
the California and Pacific Northwest power markets.
"Generally we do not favor price caps since they do not allow a wholesale
market to work competitively," said William Gaines, Puget Sound Vice
President of energy supply, in a prepared statement. "But in this case the
only thing worse than a price cap is a price cap on only part of the
market."
Puget Sound said in an Oct. 26 complaint filed with the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission that it is "unfair and unduly discriminatory to
protect wholesale purchasers in California with a price cap and yet deny
similar protection to wholesale purchasers in another part of essentially
the same market."
Thousands of energy transactions occur each month between the Pacific
Northwest and California, according to Puget Sound.
"While Puget Sound Energy strongly supports a competitive marketplace, any
federal action that will alter the wholesale electric market in one region
needs to apply to all affected parts of that region," Gaines said.
Price caps imposed only in California would result in the state buying power
in the Pacific Northwest at lower prices and customers in the Pacific
Northwest paying higher costs when that region purchases power from
California, according to the company.
