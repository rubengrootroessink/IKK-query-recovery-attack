Geezo, it wasn't suppose to be a big party I spent most of the night doing
laundry and putting my room together.  Big surprise about you and breaking
your sobriety :) you must be feeling better than.  I'm glad to hear that
your interviews went well.  I'm sure you'll get the job.  This weekend so
far I am going out with Jeff tonight (the neighbor) to MuMu's (is that how
it's spelt?) and then tomorrow I am getting my hair cut and colored.  So I
will be a new person when you get back.  And then Saturday night I'm going
over to Woj's to watch the game.  My uneventful weekend seemed to get busy
in the last 24 hours.

Sounds like a blast.  My work thing was fun.  I broke my sobreity and got
really drunk, went home and passed out at 8pm.  I was totally loaded.  It
was very fun though. My interviews went awesome yesterday.  I think I will
get that job.   So what do you have planned for the weekend?  Anything
exciting?
