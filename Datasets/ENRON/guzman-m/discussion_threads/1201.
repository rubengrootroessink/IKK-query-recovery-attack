Hey Guys. 

We have a new strategy taking power from the south to the north. Right now 
Sierra Pacific will only let us schedule 12MW on the tie so do not try to 
schedule any more (The tie is only good for 17MW).

- Either do a export from SP15 to Silverpeak or put in a wheel going out at 
Silverpeak(From PV or FC).
- Buy transmission from SPP from  (www.swoasis.com ) CONTROL TO HILLTOP. 
($6.90 on-peak, $3.90 off-peak)
- Buy transmission from PAC from MAL2 TO MAL5. ($5.84)
- Buy transmission from BPA from HILLTOP TO SNOHO or another Sink. (Account 
numbers below).

We need to bounce this of SNOHO before we send it back in at Malin. 

THIS SCHEDULE NEEDS TO BE TAGGED OR SIERRA PACIFIC GETS VERY PISSED OFF, THEY 
ARE NOT USED TO DOING TO MUCH REAL TIME. THERE IS A TEMPLATE FOR THIS 
SCHEDULE SO IT SHOULD NOT BE HARD. Call and confirm the request with both PAC 
and Sierra.



Also do not sell to a marketer(especially POWEREX) without sleeving. We do 
not want anybody else to know about the path. If Powerex sees this I 
guarantee that they would try to schedule this and we do not want 
competition. Right now the only person using the tie is SOCAL EDISON and they 
are flowing 12MW into Cali, going the opposite way of us way.  

It is available 24hrs a day so lets take advantage of it as much as we can.
If you have any questions over the weekend call me.

SPP-PUGET: 853725
