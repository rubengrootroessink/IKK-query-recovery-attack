Hey.
I had a question I wanted to ask you. I know you talked about taking the
extra $10,000 you got and investing it for me. I was wondering if you were
still going to do that or if you just took it and paid David. Even if you
could give me the $4,000 left over after paying him $6,000 it would help.
I'm kinda in a jam right now (between you and I) and I have some stuff I
need to pay. I still owe Jay $5,500 for my car that he put on a credit card,
and I have $4,000 of it, but if I give it all to him, that leaves me pretty
broke. $27,000 of my money is stuck in my loan with the credit union, I paid
mom like $2,000, paid off my credit, and have been making 2 car payments and
2 insurance payments since I still have the Neon. Even if you can only give
me the $4,000 or even half of that...anything would help. I didn't know if
you were still keeping that $10,000 for me or not, if you're not let me
know. If you weren't, maybe you could lend me some money and I can pay you
back...I'll be at work all day so E-Mail me back and let me know OK? Thanks.
I love you.
