Traders Calling 'Foul'
HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--The New York Mercantile Exchange natural gas futures
contracts are expected to open 75 cents to 80 cents higher again Thursday in
a march toward $10 per million British thermal units gas prices, traders
said.
ACCESS trading again pushed the numbers, with January gas trading in a wide
$8.61-$9.539/MMBtu range, with the last deal done at $9.95/MMBtu, $1.465
higher than Wednesday's already record $8.485/MMBtu settlement.
"This market resembles a clasic bull blow-off market," said Charlie Sanchez
of Gelber Associates in Houston.
Over-the-counter market was trading early Thursday at $9.28-$9.34/MMBtu,
with physical gas at the Henry Hub seen at $9.35-$9.43/MMBtu, traders said,
compared with Wednesday's closing range of $8.53-$9.30.
Traders see options at $9.00/MMBtu, with 8,200 positions and another 4,600
holding option calls at $10/MMBtu.
Swing swap physical trade has topped $10/MMBtu, a trader said.
"Trees don't grow to the sky," an East Coast trader said early Thursday.
"Not even manipulated ones."
"I've worked in gold markets and in potatoes," a trader said. "I know a
manipulated market when I see one."
Forecasters are predicting colder weather through December, a trader said,
but several traders have come down hard in complaints about the volatility
of a market jerked skyward in late night, low-volume ACCESS trading.
Support remains at $8.10 and $7.43, with resistance at $10 and $11.10,
traders said.
