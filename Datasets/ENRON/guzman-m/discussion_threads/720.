Hi All,

Our car club has partnered with Kiwanis International in this year's classic 
car raffle.  The car is a 1965 Mustang GT Fastback, in red, and all proceeds 
will be donated to Doernbecher's Hospital.  The tickets are $2 each, and I 
have them available if you would like to puchase some.  The car will be 
raffled off at the Oregon State Fair in Salem on September 3, 2001, and you 
need not be present to win.

A photo of the car is attached for your viewing pleasure.

Caroline
