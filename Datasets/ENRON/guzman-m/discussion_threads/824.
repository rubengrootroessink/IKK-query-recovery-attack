I was tired of the "softball" subject line
ok, its been a while since you have heard from me, mostly because i have been 
out of the office and also out of town.  so, without further delay, i need to 
get some $money$ from you guys so we can get registered.  here then is the 
deal, i need $60 from each of you to cover the fee, game balls, new bats, and 
fees for a practice field.  i also need it fairly quickly, so sorry to pass 
on my deadlines to you guys, but hey payday is coming up.  you can send me a 
check at home which is
chris hartman
4936 SW 60th Place, #2
Portland, OR 97221
or you can call me at home at 503-296-0782 or at work at 503-273-0361 and we 
can make arrangements.  i will come by your house if i have to or if you guys 
want to meet me downtown for some happy hour we can do that to.  whatever it 
takes, and i will go out of my way to accomodate you.  once we are 
registered, i will then want to find out what people want to do as far as 
practices go.  since last years practices were such a rousing success (the 
best one had 6 people show up) i want to get your input so we dont waste time 
or money.  and i also want to do some batting cages.  anyways i'm getting 
ahead of myself, just show me the money.  and let me know if you have any 
questions.
