We have had recurring problems with Morgan's west power group(scheduling, 
real time, anyone) being absolutely unreachable after 2 pm our time, for any 
reason.  

Geir had a number of their schedules have difficulty this weekend, and called 
me in desperation for a way to reach them. I have spoken to Morgan's staff 
numerous times about their unavailability, and those conversations seem to 
have no impact.

Today it presents a problem because  one of their tags is denied, and there 
is nobody there to fix them. They did not correct their tag, and I had to 
intervene and create one on their behalf and deal with the control area at 5 
pm.

Please keep these diffuculties in mind, and if you have any influence with 
their trading staff, encourage them to beef up their staffing, especially on 
real time.
