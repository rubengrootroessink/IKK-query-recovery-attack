Group,
A quick reminder.  When doing a buy/resale where we are purchasing from a 
counterparty, please make the buy price the price you pay the counterparty 
and the sell price the price the counterparty pays you.  So for a $5 
buy/resale at 130/135 the legs would be a buy at $135, and a sell at $130.  
In scheduling you will see a positive price of $5.  A negative price in 
scheduling represents US getting paid.  If you have questions please ask.

Thanks,
Bill Williams
