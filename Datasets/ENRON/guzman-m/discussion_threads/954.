Group,

From now on do not sell the generator's schedules real time for all day or 
for a good portion of the day  like we used to because the ISO has been 
cutting our exports at NOB in conjunction with our gen schedules.

Per Chris Foster, if we decide to sell any of the gen schedules real time we 
only do it for a couple of hours at a time. That way when we see that the ISO 
cuts the exports we can immediately cut the gen schedule.  This is the way I 
was told to proceed in these cases in the future. 

If you have any questions ask Chris or Bill

thanks,
Monika
