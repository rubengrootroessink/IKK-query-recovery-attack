Group,

Starting tomorrow, SATURDAY 17th of FEB, all schedules need to be tagged all 
hours!!!!!!!!  The initial 30 day trial period of tagging during the week 
only is over.  Starting at midnight tonight, everything has to be tagged all 
the time.  We need to work hard to make sure this is done correctly.  This 
means that all El Paso schedules all weekend long will have to be tagged as 
well.   Push the marketers at COB to create the tags on our NW schedules.  I 
suggest that you put the tag numbers in the INC sheet all the time, 
regardless of who does the tag.  This will ultimately help in settlement 
issues.  If you have any questions regarding the creation of any tags or OATI 
in general, don't hesitate to give me a call.  I can always be reached on my 
cell phone at 503.880.5310.

Good Luck
Jesse
