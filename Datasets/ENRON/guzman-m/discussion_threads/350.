team, 

Do not send any HA 24 schedules that you do not intend to send.  In other 
words, remove all schedules that are not the specific ones you want to send.  
We have been sending zero schedule when we don't want to be.  If we go back 
to only sending our HA 24 schedules, we can avoid this problem.

Thanks
Jesse
