Group,

On April 27th and 28th there will be a training class offered in Portland, 
Oregon with two spots available.  The course is Electric System Operation for 
the Non-engineer.  The course highlights include:
Generation
Transmission and Overhead
Distribution Systems
Underground Distribution
Switchgear
Voltage Control
Matching Generation

The course will purportedly provide a comprehensive understanding of system 
operations including fossil fuel, hydro and nuclear generation, transmission 
and distribution.  The course should provide not only technical information 
but also economics of operation, system and equipment protection and safety.
I will be taking the class along with two members of the real-time group.  If 
this is a useful class (as it appears to be) we will have the opportunity to 
attend it again later this year.  If you are interested in attending this 
class on these dates please let me know as soon as possible. 

Thanks,

Bill
