On Saturday ON-PEAK, we will be selling 200 mws in NP-15 to CERS.  ST-Cali 
has already made the entry in CAPS and the sale to CERS in Enpower.  We will 
need to supply 200 mws in NP-15 on Saturday.  I have made the enpower deal to 
sell to ST-Cali.  We will need to put purchases in and route them to this 
deal.  Deal #530641 in enpower.  Be creative.  The price to beat is $265.  
This the only sale we are currently making to CDWR.

Thanks for the work.
Bill
