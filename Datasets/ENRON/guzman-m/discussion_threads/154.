Effective immediately,   we need to make every effort to avoid buying Malin 
P/X energy,   bouncing   this energy off of a NW control area  and sending 
back in the ISO to cover our load in NP.   We now have the ability to adjust 
bid an SC purchase in NP with the PX.   This allows us to adjust bid to our 
load in NP15,  effectively limiting our expense risk to cover load

Leaf Harasin has created a procedure for this process.     Jesse Bryson has 
been working on this project as well.

It is important to note that we are experiencing some difficulty with the P/X 
as they are not entirely comfortable with this process yet.
Additionally,  we are having some internal software difficulty managing this 
new feature.    See David Poston or call Pete Davis for support,  as usual.


Thanks,

JMF
