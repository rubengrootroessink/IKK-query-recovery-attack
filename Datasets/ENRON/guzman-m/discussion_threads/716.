Group,

I received this email from Tony and thought it would be best to forward it on 
to everyone.  As you can see, we need to look closely at all communications 
between EPE and Real Time (this goes for all our service customers).  Every 
day we need to look at the dispatch or any other emails that we receive in 
the West Real-time email box.  We need to make sure we pay attention to what 
our customers want/need. It is crucial that we notice these details.  It does 
not look good when we miss these things..........

Jesse,

We may have a small communication problem developing between EPE marketing
and ENRON.  Yesterday (Monday afternoon), I sent a unit commitment for
Tuesday, January 30.  In the model, I had Copper off and a note at the
bottom of the model stating that Copper would not be available for dispatch
in the morning.  The reason I did that is because we had scheduled work on
Copper in the morning.  Since Copper is a remote start-up unit, personnel
from one of the plants (Newman) drove up to the Copper station early in the
morning (around 7:00 am, MST) to start working on the unit.  They were
surprised to find the unit running after being assured that the unit would
be off.  You can imagine the amount of calls that went back and forth
trying to figure out why the unit was running and who was responsible for
the unit being on.   Also, we had an idle crew at Copper wondering what to
do most of the morning.

Can you find out what happened and call me back so we can discuss ways of
avoiding this in the future.  Thanks, I'll put on my thinking cap to try to
come out with some ideas too.

Attached is EPE's unit commitment for Tuesday, January 30.  Copper will not
be available tomorrow morning, if projections are far off for HE 07:00, you
can probably purchase reserves just for that hour to make it through.  Call
me if there is any questions at 4181 or 5808.
