Just an update that there are new MP3s available for download at <http://www.24bom.com> - click on the listen link.  These were recorded on Jan 17th at the Medicine Hat Gallery.  Speaking of the Medicine Hat, the boys will be there next week !!!  That's right, after you listen to those MP3s come on down Thursday February 7th and watch'em do it all over again.
 
 
 
Thanks for listening-
 
24BOM!
