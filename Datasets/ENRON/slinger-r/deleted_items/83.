Now I know I've missed seeing the boys play!  But that problem is almost over, after a very relaxing holiday season 24BOM is back on stage.  This time at Conan's, at 39th and Hawthorne.  The show is Friday Jamuary 11th 9ish.  
 
We certainly hope to see you there.   Check out <http://www.24bom.com> for more show dates and other fun crap.

 

C-U-THER!
