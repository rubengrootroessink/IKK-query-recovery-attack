Hey there, kids.  We just wanted to remind you about some upcoming shows.  =
First of all, we'll be at the Medicine Hat Gallery on 2/7 -- it's a great r=
oom with the best sound in Portland.  Music starts at 9PM and we'll be on a=
t 10PM.  For those of you who missed our last show there, you can hear it o=
n our site www.24bom.com.  We will also be recording this show for our live=
, interactice cd we're working on (hopefully available sometime in May), an=
d this may be your last chance to have your voice in the crowd.  Another gr=
eat reason to attend is that we'll be followed by Junco Parker -- those of =
you who went to the Conan's show last month know how kick-booty those guys =
are.   We'll be taking the rest of the month off so Willie and Jenny can ge=
t married. Our first show will be a big one at The White Eagle on 3/8 with =
Lawnboys opening the show @ 9PM.  We've been looking forward to this one fo=
r a long time and we're very glad to have those fellers playing with us.  O=
n 3/22 we'll be at Buffalo Gap all by our lonesome @ 9PM.  On April 6 we'll=
 be back at the Hat playing on an ALLSTAR  bill with Junco Parker and Lawnb=
oys (that is if Lawnboys ever confirm -- you know how difficult it is to pi=
n down rockstars) show at 9:30.  We will be playing at the Jasmine Tree on =
4/20 (ooh, 4:20!) with the super funky sounds of Hip Replacement.  Anyhow, =
that's the schedule for now, but stay tuned for more shows and maybe a supr=
ise or two.=20

Take it easy and we'll see you at the shows,=20
Twenty Four Bitches on Mezcal=20
