Hey kiddies,
 
Well, it's a new year and we're ready to rawk.  In the coming months we have quite a bit going on.  One big high light is Friday March 8th @ the White Eagle with Lawnboys.  For those of you that have never seen them, be prepared for some kickin' down home funky jam grass.  If'n we're lucky they'll bust out some Zeppelin.  More pressing, we've got a show @ Conan's (39th & Hawthorne) this Friday Jan 11th w/ Junco Parker.  Music starts around 9 and we'll be on at 10:30 or so.  We'll be recording live @ the Medicine Hat Gallery on  Thursdays Jan 17th & Feb 7th.  Both shows will start around 9:30 and will only be 45 minutes or an hour, so you'll be in bed early enough for a school night.  We're taking the rest of February off on account of Willie gettin' hitched.  We'll be at the Buffalo Gap on Friday March 22nd.
 
Upcoming non-24BOM show's you may want to check out are: AC Cotton (whiskey rock, straight up) Jan 12th @ Ash Street, The Handsome Family (spooky goth country)  @ the Blackbird Jan 15th, Concrete Blonde (remember high school?) @ Roseland Jan 29th, Jay Farrar (if you don't know him, you should) @ the Aladdin Jan 30th and Leftover Salmon (bring yer weed and yer dancin shoes) @ Crystal Ballroom Feb 1st.
 
We hope to have our live interactive cd available in April.  Word on the street is that Yodelin' Dean and his computer geek friends are putting something cool together.  We'll keep you in the loop.  In the meantime, make sure you visit the web page www.24bom.com <http://www.24bom.com/> to get your daily fix.  And if you can't remember when we are playing, just send an email to showdates@24bom.com <mailto:showdates@24bom.com> , the dates will be delivered to you mailbox!. We're switching servers and updating the page, so watch for some changes.
 
See y'all at the shows!
 
XOXO,
