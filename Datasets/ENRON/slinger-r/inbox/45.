Hey Slinger,

It looks like Skilling was a 5-star chef at cooking the books.

"By structuring the deals as involving forward commitments to deliver Enron stock, it appears that Enron was able to assure that losses on them would not lead to reported losses, but instead to reductions of shareholder equity that had no effect on the income statement."
