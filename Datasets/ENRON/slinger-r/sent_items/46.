PLEASE BE VERY CAREFUL WITH DEAL ENTRY, EXTENDING DEALS, BROKER FEES AND KEEPING STRAIGHT WHICH BOOK YOU ARE DOING THE DEAL UNDER.  THESE ARE ALL PROBLEMS I ENCOUNTERED WHEN RUNNING THE SAR TONIGHT IN A ADDITION TO MPC DEALS NOT BEING IN THE SHEET, AS I TALKED TO YOU GUYS ABOUT THAT EARLIER.  PLEASE SORT THE SERVICES AND INC SHEET EITHER BY DEAL, SOURCE OR SINK.  JUST LUMPING IT ALL TOGETHER IN AN ENDLESS STRING OF DEALS IS LIKE PLAYING 52 CARD PICK UP WHEN THERE ARE MISTAKES IN MANY OF THE DEALS.
