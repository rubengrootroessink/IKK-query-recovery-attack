I designed a slightly different el paso model and it is in the Jan 02 el paso folder under Test El Paso Model.  The differences are just getting rid of the PX junk and adding in places to copy in the dispatch info(notes and proposed buy/sale decisions).  It should make it easier for the person on the following day shift to make a good hand off and evening peak decision.  If you have any ideas or want to design a new preschedule tab or anything else that would be cool.
