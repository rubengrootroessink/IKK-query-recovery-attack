AFTER TALKING TO KATE HERE I WAS MADE AWARE THAT SOME DEALS WERE ZEROED OUT IN "DEAL SCHEDULING" FOR THAT DAY.  CONSTELLATION IS CORRECT THOUGH, IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN 25MW AT 40 DOLLARS.

THANKS,

RYAN

Hi Ryan,

On August 21, the following deal contained 0 mws and 0 $'s.  According to the Counterparty, which is Constellation, it should have 25 mws @ $40.00.  It's for hour ending 15.  If you have any questions, please give me a call.

Thanks
