I had to change your august schedule since I misread leaf's vacation request.  The way I have it now is four night shifts in a row from the 8th through the eleventh.  This shouldn't be too bad since you have seven nights off prior to the schedule.  I couldn't figure out any other way to do it, while keeping everyone else's requests whole.  If you would rather break up your six day then give me a call and I will make the adjustments.

thanks,

ryan
