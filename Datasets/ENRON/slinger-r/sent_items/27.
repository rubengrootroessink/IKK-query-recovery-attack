ACCORDING TO ENPOWER THIS DEAL WAS DONE ON ENRON ONLINE, AND IT DOES HAVE 25MW AT $40 IN THE DEAL.  THE WAY IT READS OVER HERE IS THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO DISPUTE.  IF I AM READING THIS INCORRECTLY LET ME KNOW.

THANKS,

RYAN

Hi Ryan,

On August 21, the following deal contained 0 mws and 0 $'s.  According to the Counterparty, which is Constellation, it should have 25 mws @ $40.00.  It's for hour ending 15.  If you have any questions, please give me a call.

Thanks
