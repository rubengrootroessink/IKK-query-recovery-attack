Hello Ryan,	

	My name is Garrett Stephenson and I am a executive recruiter in the Houston area. I currently have a few opportunities available in ERCOT and WSCC trading and was wondering if you would be interested in looking at these opportunities or if you knew someone that would.   Please let me know a good phone number and time to contact you.   I am representing a great company who is offering great benefits, base, and 17% of the book back to the traders.

Thanks.
