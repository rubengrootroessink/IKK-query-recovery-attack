AMEREX

Diana/Sean
I am missing the following deal:
1) Enron sells to Powerex MId-C light 3/29 at $140.00


Chris Mallory
Amerex does not recognize deal 563362




BLOOMBERG
All deals are o.k.





PREBON

Chris Mallory
deal 563461
Is this a duplicate of 563460 because Prebon only recognizes 1 deal

deal 563358
Prebon says should be heavy not light hrs.
