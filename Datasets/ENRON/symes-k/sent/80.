Okay, I don't know where Jeff's head was today, but he just checked with 
Prebon and found he had done this deal without even knowing it! So he entered 
it - Deal #461171.

Thanks a lot for your patience, Stephanie.

Prebon is sending a new confirmation with Constellation as the counterparty. 
Broker mistake.

Tom Alonso's name is on bro confirm (Peco) but deal 459243.01 is under Mark 
Fischer (COnstellation)
