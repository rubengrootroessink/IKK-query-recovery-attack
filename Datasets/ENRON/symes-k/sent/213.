474520 - Should not be $210. Actually, Bob just changed the deal to $307, so 
it was in wrong, but he said Prebon's price is totally off.

474593 - Again, we had the price wrong, but so did Prebon. Mallory just 
changed it to $210.

These last two deals are in now - 474604 and 474605.

Thanks,
Kate
