I realize this is late notice, but it just occurred to me that I never 
discussed my Christmas vacation plans with you when I transferred into 
Trading. I have a family trip planned and paid for, so I hope it won't cause 
too much chaos if I'm gone. I understand the tendency for people to feel lost 
and helpless without me.

I'm supposed to be in California with my dad on Dec. 22, then in Mexico with 
my mom from Dec. 26 to Jan. 2. So I basically need to miss four days of work. 
Again, I'm sorry to bring this to you so late, and I'd be glad to do any 
amount of work before or after, or even spend my holiday entering deals on 
the computer in some exotic Central American internet cafe. I've heard 
they're great places to rage.

We can discuss the logistics when you're back in the office. And by the way, 
the flame in this e-mail does not indicate anger, but rather is meant to be a 
festive, joyous, holiday-time explosion.
