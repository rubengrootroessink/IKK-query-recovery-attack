Bend like a reed in the wind? It's funny you should say that, since I've been 
reading a lot about Buddhist philosophy lately. I stayed with a couple in 
London who practice Buddhist meditation pretty regularly. Ever since then 
I've thought something like that would do a world of good for my mental 
health, being that I've always been more of a giant steel piling than a reed 
when the wind kicks up. I did let her have it, don't worry; but my Catholic 
guilt always gets the best of me, and I assure you I'll be extending all 
kinds of undeserved compassion by this evening.

As far as the sick thing goes - screw that. That's one occasion you cannot 
take lying down, or bending like a reed as it were. You sabotage that thing 
with vitamin C and some uber-multi-vitamin and echinacea and hot water with 
lemon and honey and 14 hours of sleep a night UNTIL IT RUNS SCREAMING FROM 
YOUR BODY. I hate being sick...almost as much as I hate bending like a reed. 

Speaking of Woody Allen - I saw his new one, "Small Time Crooks," last night. 
I'd give it an unenthusiastic "mediocre." Rent it if you've exhausted all 
other options. Tonight I think we're going to check out "Traffic" - I've 
heard rave reviews. Or otherwise it's "Cinema Paradiso" for the 
sixty-thousandth time, but this time on the big screen. The deciding factor 
will be money, and beer. "Traffic" will cost twice as much as "Cinema," but 
the theater showing "Cinema" has comfy couches and serves beer, so I'll end 
up spending twice as much as I would at "Traffic." Do you see the moral 
dilemma here? 

I'm sorry to ramble, but today happens to be alarmingly devoid of surprises. 
Having said that, I'm practically positive some catastrophe will occur in the 
next 30 seconds, so I'm going to go now.

Kate

I can't believe that bitch would just wander into the house full of ire and 
phasers set to kill. I hope you let her have it. Some friend! She was just 
trying to get your goat. Knows to how to press your buttons and will continue 
to until she grows up. If I were you I'd follow the Buddhist path--extend 
compassion to her, don't let your state of mind be controlled by what she 
does, bend like a reed in the wind, etc. Anyhoo . . .

I started to get a little sick last night. Think I might have been running a 
fever, so I came home and went to bed early. But I don't always sleep so 
well. The bed I'm?using gives me the distinct impression that I'm sleeping on 
a grade, that I'm slipping into a pit or a valley. My dreams?are always about 
climbing out of things. And then Hector the dachshund sleeps on the bed with 
me and even though he's only about a foot and a half long, it always seems 
like he takes up all the room. Oh, I'm just complaining. Cross your fingers 
that I don't get sick.

"Croupier " I've always wanted to see. Glad you give it the thumbs up. I 
think I'm going to head downstairs and watch a movie myself. Perhaps Woody 
Allen's "Manhattan," an old fave I haven't seen in years.

Talk to you soon. Oh yes, and about the weekend. Of course I give you the 
"flaky"?time allowance you need. I would demand the same for myself. If you 
decide to come down, you don't even have to tell us until Friday or Saturday. 
You don't even have to tell us at all. You could just come and not see us and 
head back Sunday if you want. We are that tolerant of flakiness here. No, 
seriously, if you feel like coming it would be wonderful to see you. If not, 
another time will come.
