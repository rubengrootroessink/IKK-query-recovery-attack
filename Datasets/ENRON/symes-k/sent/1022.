Hello Kate,
APS and Pinnacle...We ran into a problem checking out for the end of the 
month, because a few deals had Pinnacle in the system, but Bloomberg on the 
bro confirm.  We had to ch them to match the broker confirms, because APS 
showed the deals as APS on there side.  They are trying to segregate 
companies little by little.  We have been told by Rhonda, our contract 
administrator that trading under both names are legally correct, both are 
under WSPP.  

DeeDee from Pinnacle said all trades are with Pinnacle unless Bloomberg 
trade; then cp should be APS.  DeeDee said shortly all trades will be under 
Pinnacle, but did not give me a specific date.       

Please let the traders know that all trades should be with Pinnacle West, and 
APS that are transacted with Bloomberg.  No, we will not have problems 
recognizing the old name, Rhonda says they will just be assigned over to 
Pinnacle, but we will not have to revise confirms.  Hope this helps!
Thanks
Stephanie

563906 - changed to Pinnacle West
563907 - changed to Pinnacle West
562226 - changed to APS

Regarding the last deal, Mike Driscoll talked to his broker at Bloomberg last 
night and asked him to change their confirm to say Pinnacle West. The broker 
said he'd check on it, but that Bloomberg hadn't switched their contract over 
yet and he didn't know if they could check a deal out under the new name. So 
we left it, under the impression that Bloomberg was actually in the wrong. My 
question is - has APS switched over to Pinnacle West entirely, and when or if 
Bloomberg starts recognizing Pinnacle as the counterparty are we going to 
have problems with deals containing the old counterparty name? I'm just 
trying to clarify, so I can let the traders know what to expect. Thanks for 
your help.

Kate

Kate, 

I just spoke to DeeDee of Pinnacle West, we verballed deals and she said all 
deals should be under the Pinnacle West name unless for Bloomberg 
transactions.   Please review the following 

Mark Fischer
563906.01  non brokered > cp name should be Pinnacle West
563907.01  non brokered > cp name should be Pinnacle West

562226.01  Bloomberg, cp name should be Arizona Public Service.  (Evelyn 
inquired about this yesterday)

Thanks for your help!
Stephanie
