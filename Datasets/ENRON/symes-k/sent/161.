I've got Mike Swerzbin checking on this deal. He says Holli Krebs actually 
did the deal, so he's trying to get a hold of her right now to verify the 
term. I'll let you know as soon as I find out.

Thanks,
Kate

When I tried to verbally confirm this deal, the counterparty has this deal 
running for three months, December through February.  Could you check with 
the trader and either change it or have him talk to the counterparty about 
it.  Let me know.

Thanks!
