I'd be more than happy to run a test of the new forward obligation report in 
order for you to move it to production. I do use the application everyday 
when determining the West desk positions in relation to each other, so it's a 
report I'm familiar with and also one that may affect me if it's changed. 
Please let me know if you'd like me to run the report and under what terms.

Thanks,
Kate Symes
