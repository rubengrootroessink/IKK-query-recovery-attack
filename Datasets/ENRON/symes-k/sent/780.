Mike said to just enter a new deal with these terms - deal is 539032, and 
I've backdated the trade date to 3/1. He's going to double-check the EES 
spreadsheet to make sure he didn't miss something. In the meantime, the deal 
is in there now.

Thanks,
Kate

Subject: missing deal

Our contact at EES is looking for a deal between Mike and Jubran at NP15 for 
$124.00  She thinks the deal date should be 3/1 and we are buying calendar 
year 2002.  I don't see anything in the system that looks like this. Can you 
check with Mike.

Thanks!
