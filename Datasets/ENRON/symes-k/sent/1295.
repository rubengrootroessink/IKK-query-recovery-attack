In regards to the e-mail you just sent - this is the most recent information 
I sent you and Brooklyn. Is this what you were missing?

Also, in response to your question about deal 595155 - where we show a buy 
from EES but Brooklyn doesn't show a sale on her side - this deal is shown in 
EnPower as well as my sheet. If you looked in the fixed price column of the 
sheet for 4/28, under SP-15, you'll see a sale for 10 MW hours 6 through 22. 
I'm not sure what it is, but somewhere there's a missing link between us and 
EES, because on my side this deal looks perfectly normal.

I'll also be sending along some revised Real Time sheets per my conversation 
with Brooklyn yesterday - you should receive those shortly. In the meantime, 
look over my sheet and let me know if you see the deal in question on the 
28th.

Thanks,
Kate

At long last, I've sorted through these deals and determined the source of 
most of these problems. I'll be calling you both shortly to go over these and 
make sure we all see the same thing. Here are a few things to note as you go 
over my responses:

566426 - rates have been changed/has this shown up on your CARP report yet?
578856 - deal done by Real Time trader at hour-ahead market price/will not 
correspond directly to the price shown in my spreadsheet
573862 - rate for this deal should not be $107 OR $168.45/it is an off peak 
sale from EPMI to EES, which means we go by the off peak short position price 
- shown in my sheet as $119.76

The newest deals in this variance list are Real Time. I've double-checked the 
deals in EnPower with what I see in the Real Time spreadsheets, and 
everything seems to match up. I'm attaching those sheets so we can ensure 
we're all looking at the same thing. If you have further discrepancies on 
these, the easiest way for me to clear them up would be if you include the 
specific hours you have questions about.

I'm terribly sorry for the delay in getting back to you on this - it's a 
twisted and time-consuming journey trying to find the source of these 
problems, as I'm sure you know! I hope this gets us up to speed, but please 
call me with questions or comments.

Thanks,
Kate

Kate/Brooklyn I looked over the latest file and attached my comments and what 
I see in the Carp as of yesterday.

Thanks
