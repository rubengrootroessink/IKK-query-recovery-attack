Please accept my apologies for this worksheet's absence yesterday. It was 
undergoing cosmetic improvements to more accurately represent the EES-EPMI 
position. Note two new column headings as of 3/27 - "Transmission" and "Other 
EnPower" deals. Also, a change has been made to the SP-15 volumes in the 3/2 
sheet. This change was made per Daniel Kang at EES and Chris Foster at EPMI. 
And as always, feel free to contact me with questions.

Thanks,
Kate Symes
