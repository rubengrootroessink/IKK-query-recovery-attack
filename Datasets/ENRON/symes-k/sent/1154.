Yes - I've been working with Samuel Schott in Global Counterparty and Melissa 
Murphy. The new name has been entered into the system, and deal # 573679 has 
been changed from New Counterparty to Sierra Pacific Industries, Inc. (That's 
the name Sierra Pacific Holding Co. is doing business as.) Thanks for 
checking in on this, though.

I have been out of the office.  Has anyone responded to you on this?

Because I'm not quite sure who to direct this request to, I'm e-mailing 
everyone I think might be involved in entering new counterparty names. One of 
our mid-marketers has executed a deal with Sierra Pacific Holding Company, 
which is a new counterparty name and needs to be added as a choice in 
Enpower. Please let me know if I've contacted the correct people, and if I've 
contacted the incorrect people. (Sorry!)

Thanks,
