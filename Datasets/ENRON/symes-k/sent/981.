I think that sounds like a great idea. It doesn't really serve a purpose to 
have all the time zones as a choice in Deal Blotter if EnPower is going to 
sort them out anyway. We're just doubling up on the work that the application 
already knows how to do. In the meantime, I'll sort through these deal 
numbers and change time zones that flow over the first week in April. Let me 
know if that sounds good.

Yep, the time zone glitch.  I think he was looking at all deals in the 
system.  I almost think we should deal with this April, and worry about the 
rest when it comes up.   Will and I are also kicking around making the only 
choice in deal entry PPT.  Let Enpower sort out the rest.  We can modify 
stuff on the strip level, but PPT would be the only choice in blotter and at 
the top of regular deal entry.

How does that sound?

I'm unclear as to what Will found in these deals that needs to be looked at. 
The first one (scary!!) has notes in the comments section of each leg that 
say it was terminated on 9/30/98; however, there are still forward deal legs 
that haven't been killed or zeroed out. I don't think I could consider myself 
a deal control professional on this one - I'll need to talk to a trader. But 
let me know what you want me to look for in the remaining deals. Is this part 
of the time zone glitch?

Do you want to look into these, the first one made me nearly wet my pants!  I 
think I want a deal control professional on this one.............   :)
