Mary Hain said she would get the paperwork going on this master agreement. 
Either Mary or I will be in touch to let you know when this is in place.

Can you check with Cara and see if this deal should have been put in as a 
buy/resale.  We don't have transmission with this entity (WAPA-CRSP).  Let me 
know.
