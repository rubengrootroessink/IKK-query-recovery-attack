I spoke with Mark Fischer about this - Tom Alonso stepped out of the office 
for a minute - and he said Tom would probably want to talk to his contact 
with FPL. So I'm going to wait before changing these counterparty names. I'll 
also check with him on the off peak hours for 517518, and get back to you in 
just a minute.

Thanks,
Kate

Kate, same thing on this trade. I think it should be FPL Energy Power 
Marketing b/c I received a confirm on it. Secondly on the confirm it states 
that hour 0100-0600 is priced at $95.00 and then again at hours 2300-2400. 
7-22 is priced at $140. However I do not show in the system 1-6 and 23-24 at 
$95. Did he forget to put in the off peak or is FPL incorrect.

Thanks,
