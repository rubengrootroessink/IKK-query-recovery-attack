Geir zeroed deal 581368, and added deal 592672. There is another deal 
corresponding with this that completes the path from Four Corners to NP-15. 
Please let me know if you see this come through.

Thanks,
Kate

I just spoke with Jesse Bryson in Real Time, and he said this should actually 
be 2 buy-resales - one from Four Corners to ZP-26, and one from ZP-26 to 
NP-15. Let me know how that sounds to you, and I'll enter the deals.

Thanks,
Kate

Should this be NCPA, since we do not have transmission with them.  Or maybe 
it should be a buy/resale.  let me know.  Thanks.
