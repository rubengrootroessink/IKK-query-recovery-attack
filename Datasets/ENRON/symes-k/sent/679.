I must know why your roommates are so scary! Mine - well, that's just 
obvious. Oh, and since we last e-mailed, Molly has gone out and landed 
herself a full-fledged boyfriend. Anything to avoid getting a job. He's a 
"natural healer" and he's also had "an experience with Jesus," so this one 
should be REALLY interesting. Amber and I had a few drinks last night and 
basically pretended like nothing happened - it's easier that way. We both 
know there's no real friendship to salvage, so keeping it strictly in the 
bars is the smartest thing to do. And Anna, don't think for a minute that my 
description of life in Portland is exciting or cultured or romantic, cause 
it's pretty much the polar opposite of all those things. I've been so tired 
this week that I've been spouting out sentences like "The red computer needs 
to climb my shoelaces and the people riding the dinosaurs are wrong." It's 
definitely been interesting. I'm on my way to sushi with a few people right 
now, but of course I can see my reflection in my forehead and my hair looks 
like a sad, sad, small animal. Super! Maybe I'll meet the man of my dreams. 
I'll tell you, Anna - I know you've got scary clashing dresser man, but 
sometimes from the single person's point of view, that doesn't look so bad. 
Hang in there - and call me soon!

Love,
Kate

Hey buttface!

Wow - it actually sounds like your roommate problems may be comparable to
mine (except that you probably don't fear for your life quite as much).  Who
is paying for Amber to come to Denver?  It sounds like she might be a little
out of her mind right now, but at least she's not going back to Chris just
yet.  So are you going to Seattle this weekend?  That sounds so fun!  I am
so jealous - parties, dinners, wine, men.  You and I are NOT living the same
life right now.  I am in the process of trying to break things off with the
ugly dresser, which was proving to be difficult until last night, when I
made the mistake of letting him come to a movie with Michelle and I.  Kate,
I was scared.  It was dark and I was surrounded by the two most psycho
people I know.  Josh talked through the whole thing and laughed at
inappropriate moments and tried to hold my hand at one point.  It was
excruciating!  It made Michelle look almost normal.

Not much else going on.  I'll call you this weekend, okay?  We need to dish.

Luego,
Anna

Subject: Re: Rockin in the Rockies, bro



So didya hear the Blazers creamed the Nuggets last night? I always knew the
Pacific Northwest would dominate in sports - they're not battling with that
ol' Rocky Mountain High if ya know what I mean.

Well I'm sorry I didn't get back to you yesterday - work was hectic and I
knew that if I started an e-mail to you it would either be half-assed or
I'd never finish it. Well, I'm going for the former now, because I realized
there would never be a good time to divulge the full and sordid details of
what's happening around here, and all the while I wait, more and more
important nuggets (get it!) of gossip are accumulating.

So it's quite appropriate that you wrote yesterday with roommate issues -
mine could not be worse. Amber took off for the "library" on Thursday night
and came home.....four days later. After Molly and I had a mild freak-out
session on Friday - which included calling everybody she's every known,
including Chris and the police - we heard through the grapevine that Marky
McCulloch, of Neidermeyer cousin fame, was in town from none other than
Denver and the two were having a secret and James-Bond-like rendezvous at
the beach. Well that was all well and fine, other than the fact that she
DIDN'T TELL US SHE WAS LEAVING and we had been planning a housewarming
party this weekend for the past month and she DIDN'T TELL US SHE WAS
LEAVING and she moved kitty into the house but still hasn't told our
landlords or paid the $500 deposit, oh, and also, SHE DIDN'T TELL US SHE
WAS LEAVING. So many things were wrong and bizarre about that, but none
more than her attitude when she walked in the door Monday afternoon. Let's
just say I spared no lung muscles in telling her exactly what I thought
about her selfish, childish, idiotic, and most importantly, psychotically
self-important behavior. She had the gall to defensively scream back that
she didn't tell us BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T WANT TO LIE. Hmmmm. Not only did she
not want to lie - how sweet - but she couldn't have told us because Molly
and I have suddenly developed an insatiable urge to spread fervent and
widespread rumors about Amber's love trysts. Now, I KNOW there's nothing
I'd rather be doing.

Anyway, enough of that. She and I have reached an understanding that just
because we're roommates does not mean we have to be friends. We've never
been good at that anyhow. In other news, we had an amazing housewarming
party. I really wish you could have been there. Molly and I didn't know 90
percent of the people there, which is a good thing because it meant they
were all interesting, successful, gracious and cute. I think there were
about four girls there - you could tell who planned the party. Sadly, no
love connections were made that evening, but I've decided that's my new
M.O. - keep 'em guessing. My friend Michael from Maui who now lives in
Seattle came down with his friend Jordan who happens to be hot and writing
an article for Food & Wine magazine. Very interesting guy, but potentially
in the closet, so I'm keeping my distance. But they invited me up to
Seattle next weekend for a five-course meal and $100 bottles of wine at
some Microsoft dude's mansion. Definitely sounds like my crowd. Should I
wear my dirty jeans or my clean jeans?

I've got my eye on flights to Denver, but right now it's looking like the
end of March before I can scrape up that kind of cash. Amber on the other
hand will be there five times before that because some psycho over there
keeps buying her tickets. That's fair for ya.

Okay, that's all I can do for now, but call me tonight and we'll do the
rumor mill justice. Take care and hang in there - we'll be booting a
roommate soon if you feel like coming back to Portland.
