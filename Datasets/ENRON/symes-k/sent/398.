Just spoke with Sean Crandall - he killed deal #499391. This has happened 
before, and seems to be a glitch in Deal Blotter when traders enter off peak 
deals. I'll talk with IT about it; but thanks for catching this in the 
meantime.

Hi Kate,

For Ref 499391 I don't think this is a good deal because Prebon only shows 
one off-peak deal like this and it is our reference 499390.


Thanks
