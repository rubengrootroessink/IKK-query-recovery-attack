 New Energy Secretary Guesses He Ought To Read Up On Energy

WASHINGTON, DC-- Spencer Abraham, the newly installed U.S. Energy Secretary, 
admitted Monday that he probably ought to read up on energy. "I know energy 
is really important, and that there was a big crisis back in the '70s, but 
other than that, I'm in the dark," Abraham said. "I was hoping to be 
appointed Secretary of Transportation, which I know a lot more about, but 
that one was already taken." The former Michigan senator said he plans to go 
to the library Thursday to look up "Energy" in The World Book Encyclopedia.
