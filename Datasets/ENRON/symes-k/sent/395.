Who's ready to rhumba? Crystal Ballroom holds salsa classes on the first 
Tuesday of every month. The hour-long class begins at 7p.m., with live music 
and dancing afterward. Cost is $8 for the whole evening. The other Tuesdays 
of the month have live music and dancing, no class unfortunately. Anyway, I'm 
sure it won't take us more than an hour to become master Latin dancers on par 
with Ricky Martin and Christina Aguilera.

Do you want to try it out? Next class is Feb. 6. Mark your calendars and tell 
all your coordinated (and/or good-looking) friends to come along.

*Does this mean "live dance" or "dance lives" or "my friend Viva likes the 
way you dance" or none of the above?
