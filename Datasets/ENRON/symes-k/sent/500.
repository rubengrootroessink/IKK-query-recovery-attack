Please change to Power Marketing.  Edward Sacks in credit has indicated that 
it should be them.  Thanks.

I just spoke with Sean Crandall, the trader on these deals, and he said the 
counterparty could be either Conoco Pipeline Co. or Conoco Power Marketing. 
If credit has specified the latter, I'll change these deals. Just let me know.

Thanks,
Kate
