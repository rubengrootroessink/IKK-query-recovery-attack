It was great to run into you, too. This shrinking world never ceases to amaze 
me......to end up working in the same building, different industry, over a 
year later? Crazy. So, on lunch or a beer after work, just let me know the 
time and place. Lunch is a rarity with me, but I love to have an excuse to 
breathe fresh air in the middle of the day. And I need to plan ahead as well. 
I'll keep the week of the 22nd open - sound good?

Talk to you soon.
Kate

Kate: It was great to run into you. I'm glad you've found something
interesting to do in Portland.
I'm up to my ass organizing the state AP broadcasters convention at
Sunriver the weekend of the 21st.
After that, lets plan to have lunch, or maybe a beer after work. As I
said, I come in early and leave at
about 3:30 each day. Lunches are possible, but I need to plan ahead.
Again, good to see ya.
John
