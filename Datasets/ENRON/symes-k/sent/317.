Bob just put these in - I think these guys are still warming up to the usual 
pace after the holiday.

Thanks,
Kate

488908 is with Tradition Financial Services, not Natsource. I've changed this 
in the system.

488938 was just entered by Mike Swerzbin.

And if it's at all possible to get the traders names from the brokers when 
they have missing deals, that would be wonderful. I can usually guess by 
using the information given, but sometimes the traders get busy and aren't 
exactly happy about being bugged for missing deals that aren't theirs. I'm 
not sure how it works, but Carla told me the brokers should give you all the 
information at their disposal. If they don't, or won't, let me know and I'll 
have our traders talk to them.

Thanks for your help,
Kate
