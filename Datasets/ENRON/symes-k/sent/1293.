That's strange - I entered these deals for Matt yesterday, and specifically 
typed 2 p.m. into the expiry date. Somehow it changed over, but I've changed 
it back and re-saved it - so it should read 2 PM.

Thanks for catching that,
Kate

Kate, can you please ask Matt about expiry time, the deal strip says 2:00 AM 
it should be 2:00 PM on both.  thanks
