What up dude!

I haven't heard from you in awhile, so I thought I would remind you that you
have a sister and she lives in Colorado and she has no friends and no life
and one psycho roommate and is therefore desperately in need of sane
conversation/gossip through which she can live vicariously.  How's it going?
Are you feeling better?  Is the roommate situation improving?  Mine is SO
not.  And to add to the drama, lonesomeness has once again driven me into
the arms of a man with whom I undoubtedly have no future.  He launched a
surprise attack on Valentine's Day - when my guard was obviously down.  Yes,
it's still the colorblind starbucks guy.  We were just going to go out for A
drink, but 9 vanilla stoli and cokes later we were making out like teenagers
in a prom limo.  Even his baby poop green blazer-style leather jacket had
started to look like an acceptable outerwear addition to his camel-colored
wide-whale corduroy and pumpkin orange sweater ensemble.  It was madness.
So anyway, I shacked, and unfortunately now a precedent has been set, so now
I pretty much spend most of my day coming up with various believable reasons
for not spending the night at his house.    It's been almost a week so I
think he's starting to suspect something.  Little does he know that by the
time this whole debacle is over, he will wish he had never heard the name
"Anna Symes".  He's great and fun and everything, and yet I feel that
familiar desire to kill this relationship - and not just kill it, but shoot
at it and kick it in the head even after it's dead.  Think I have issues?

Other than that, not a lot happening over here.  I like my new job, although
right now it's really dead and I find myself wondering what I'm supposed to
be doing a lot of the time.  I have been playing phone tag with Monica, but
I think I might start stalking her a little more intensely as I am in
desperate need of some friends.  Actually, starbucks guy and I had an
interesting conversation about this last night.  I have been feeling so down
lately, and I finally realized that this move was a million times harder
than London or Argentina were because I am literally starting from scratch
in the social department.  Michelle is scary and therefore does not count as
a source of moral support or even pleasant conversation.  I'm trying to see
this as a positive thing, like a challenge to see if I can be happy without
the network of people I have always had around me.  I know it's not the
Peace Corps or anything, but it's still kind of scary.  Anyway, that's my
deep thought for the week.  I'm sure soon enough I'll be crying yet once
again about how I want to come home, but for now I'm great (I think!).

By the way, have you heard Ben Lee (singer)?  He Claire Danes' boyfriend, so
you may have heard of him before.  Anyway, you have to check him out - he's
awesome!  The cd I like the best has the word hurricanes or volcanoes or
something in the title (sorry, I can't remember exactly).  It's a good
feel-good cd.  So let me know how it's going out there in P-town, and when
are you coming to visit?  Okay, love you, miss you, etc.!

Besos,
Anna

Hey there - I'm so sorry I haven't responded until now. I've been swamped
with work, moving, and now the flu. Whoo, hoo! So, as far as gossip is
concerned, I'm all dried up for now. I was going to go on a company ski
trip this weekend, but I feel so crappy I can't even imagine being outside,
let alone surrounded by snow and wind at the same time. I imagine you're
totally used to that by now, but keep in mind your weather is accompanied
by sun and not eternal grayness.

Our house is coming along nicely. Molly and I already want to boot Amber
out, but that's okay. We deal with it by laughing about her antics whenever
possible - behind her back or in front of her face. It really helps us out,
and I think it does wonders for her ego too. Work is work. The weather is
foul! Men are too. I don't even have one prospect at this point. Of course
there's always the innocent, fleeting crushes from a distance; but I've got
to admit I hardly even have the energy for those anymore.

I hope you can make it home for a visit soon, because you are going to LOVE
our house. I will definitely keep my eyes peeled for cheap tickets to
Denver, or maybe I'll just do the train and take a long weekend. Either
way, I'll definitely make it there by springtime. Tell me about your jobs,
friends (or not?), and life in general. I'm going to get back to work and
hustle so I can get out of here early and suffer peacefully at home. I'll
give you a call from my sick bed, 'kay?

Take care,
Kate
