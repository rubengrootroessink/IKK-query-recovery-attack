Hey there stranger!

Thanks for the pictures - they've definitely been the highlight of my day. 
It's funny that you sent those now, because over the weekend Molly and I had 
our big housewarming blowout party, and - speaking of strangers - Michael (of 
sushi fame) and his friend came down from Seattle for it! Weird, huh. I don't 
see or hear from the guy in half a year, and then in the same three days he 
not only comes to my house but shows up in my e-mail. 

I can't chat right now - things are just coming to a rolling boil here at 
work. But I'll give you a call this evening. Are you packed for Spain yet? 
Are you ready to leave the laid back island like to which you've grown 
accustomed? Is everyone there still as crazy as when I left them? Write back, 
or give me a call. I'd love to hear the update.

Take care,
Kate
