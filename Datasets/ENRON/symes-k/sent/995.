I've changed it to off-peak only. I was entering forward deals to exercise 
options yesterday, and they were all RTC besides this one - thanks for 
catching that. It should be good now.

Kate, just happened to notice when they entered the leg 2 of the deal 
428861.01.... is it suppose to be 7days a week, 24 hours a day,  the 
428861.01 is off peak hours only.

Thanks
