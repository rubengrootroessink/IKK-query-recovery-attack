wussup wichu, brutha? just wanted to let you know i'm done with your book. it 
was a superior work of literature, by the way. i highly recommend it. if you 
want it back, send a self-addressed stamped box to 2505 NE 32nd Pl., 
Portland, OR 97212. just kidding....gosh! that's the address of my 
super-sweet house, by the way. next time you're in town you have to come over 
and have a civilized dinner in our DINING ROOM. that's right - we have one. 
and many other rooms too. it's an all-around great place to be, let me tell 
you. gotta go control your energy now. write back.

love, 
kate
