Chris -
Here's the latest I've heard on our request for a new counterparty name 
(Sierra Pacific Holding Co.) to be added to EnPower. I faxed the master 
agreement to Melissa Murphy so the Confirms group could reference it; then 
she passed the pertinent information along to Samuel Schott in Global 
Counterparty, whose job it is to set up new counterparties. But it looks like 
your contact at Sierra is saying this deal should be done with Sierra Pacific 
Industries - the parent company - rather than Sierra Pacific Holding Co. 

Do you have a preference either way? Maybe you could contact Bob Ellery and 
discuss this. Just let me know which name to add to the deal.

Thanks,
Kate

Hello, Samuel Schott in Global Counterparty called this company and he was 
told that they should be set up in our system as Sierra Pacific Industries, 
Inc.  The contract has the long name on it so I am planning on asking Rhonda 
Denton about this tomorrow when she comes in.  I am not sure if it will work 
this way or not.  If you know anything else about this let me know.  Sierra 
Pacific Industries, Inc. is in Enpower but I am not certain if we should use 
that name.

I will let you know what Rhonda says tomorrow.  
Thanks,
Melissa

I just heard from Samuel (thanks for your message!) that I need to send 
Rhonda new counterparty information in order to get their names added to the 
system. I called Rhonda, but it turns out she's out of the office for the 
first part of this week, and her voice mail referred me to Melissa. (That's a 
short explanation of why I'm sending this info. to all of you.)

Anyway, following is the information connected with the new counterparty name 
Chris Foster has requested:

Name: Sierra Pacific Holding Company, dba Sierra Pacific Industries
Address: PO Box 496028
    Redding, CA 96049
Or: 19759 Riverside Ave.
      Anderson, CA 96007
Phone: (530) 378-8179
Fax: (530) 378-8139
Contact: Director of Energy Resources - Robert Ellery

I also have a copy of the Master Power Purchase and Sale Agreement if you'd 
like me to fax that over. Just let me know how I can help. We've already 
entered Chris's deal into the system with "New Counterparty," so the sooner 
we can change that the better.

Thanks,
Kate
