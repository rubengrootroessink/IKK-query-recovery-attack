That is actually the report I'm having problems with. The old EOL JF report 
on your desktop has somehow been replaced by the new stage version. It's 
trying to pull information from the C drive, which does not exist on terminal 
server. Nicolay is working with me to try to figure out why, but most likely 
they'll have to put the stage version into production in order for me to run 
this report again. 

Thanks for the suggestion,
Kate

Kate,

If you log in as myself, you can pull up the EOL JF Report that you were 
using originally.

I'm continuing to work with IT in Houston in an attempt to restore the EOL 
Report to its former glory. They are making several changes to the report 
which seem to result exponentially in glitches. As of right now the 
application will not create any kind of file with any kind of data; hence the 
absence of any kind of report. I will keep you informed of our progress.

Thanks for your patience,
Kate
