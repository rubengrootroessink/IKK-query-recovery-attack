I know I already discussed time off at Christmas with you, but I have really 
indecisive parents who are divorced and like to do completely opposite things 
for the holidays, so I have one modification to make. If I could take off 
from Friday, Dec. 22, to Tuesday, Jan 2, then I can accomodate both of my 
parents and head off a potentially disastrous fight over which kids go with 
which parents. It ends up being two more days off than I had asked for before 
-  the 22nd and the 2nd. I'm really sorry to ask for so much time off, but I 
wouldn't do it unless my life were going to be in jeopardy if I didn't. Thank 
you!

Kate
