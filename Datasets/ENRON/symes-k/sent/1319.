I'm sorry about that, Kim. I just got word from Les on these and I'm changing 
them as we speak. I'll e-mail you in just a minute when they're done.

Thanks,
Kate

unconfirmed.
Thanks!

Les -
Here's the latest list of unit contingent deals in need of unit names. I've 
tried referring to your unit name list and entering them myself, but it looks 
like some delivery points correspond to more than one unit. I.E. Navajo can 
originate from LV Cogen OR Saguaro Power. If you could add these unit names 
into the deals, or let me know what they are so I can enter them, it would be 
much appreciated.

Thanks,
Kate
