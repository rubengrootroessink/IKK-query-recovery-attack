Yeah, Seattle actually had a 7.0 earthquake at about 11a.m. our time. I made 
it out from under our building with only a broken leg and shattered.....no 
just kidding. What's funny is that I was on my way to lunch when the 
earthquake hit Portland, and for whatever reason - my conspicuous 
absentmindedness or the cold medicine I'm high on - I didn't feel a thing. I 
walked out into the streets of downtown to ambulances screaming all around 
and ladies freaking out and running out of buildings. I went to the little 
soup stand I always go to, and the soup guy asked if I had felt the 
earthquake, and I said, you know it's funny but I DIDN'T. And he said, well 
that IS funny because I didn't either. But I think we're the only two who 
didn't notice it. Weird, huh!

Thanks for checking though.

Kate
