According to Les, we don't need to confirm any of these deals. I guess they 
were deals done by the Real Time desk on behalf of Services, but they were 
entered incorrectly. Thanks for checking, though.

They all had some sort of replacement comment so I just wanted to double 
check to see if we should confirm.

Thanks!!
