Two of these should have fees; two should not.

Add .0075 broker fee to:
477212

Add .005 broker fee to:
474434

No broker fee on:
468440
468444

This is per Matt Motley's trade book. I'll change the fees in the deals; and 
if you have questions about the deals with no fee, let me know and I'll call 
Matt to verify.

Thanks,
Kate
