Details in exchange for this - 

I read an article this morning that quoted an ISO market analyst speaking 
about the $6.2 billion the system operator would like to recover in charges 
since last spring: "We are not saying now that these are overcharges. We are 
telling the FERC that we see these as the amounts that we deem 'excessive.'" 
The lead of the story was this: "The California Independent System 
Operator......significantly upped the ante Thursday when it told the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission that 21 generators and suppliers should refund 
the state a stunning $6.2 billion for electricity sold into the state since 
last May." 

First of all, tell me what the difference is between "overcharges" and 
"excessive" charges. If there isn't one, give me your opinion on why this 
analyst would say such a stupid thing. Second, give me one reason why the 
lead is journalistically incorrect, and one why it is gramatically 
unattractive. 

Then you get details.
