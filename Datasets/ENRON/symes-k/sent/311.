Oops - I guess the deal can't be killed because it contains liquidated 
strips. I've changed the confirm status to no confirm, and the energy to 
CAISO - so even though the deal has no volume or price, its other details are 
correct.

Hi Kate,
This deal needs to be changed to no confirm (it's a West daily deal).  Also, 
it has an NP-15 delivery point with firm energy.
Thanks!
Kim
