Here's the latest I've heard from Willie Harrell, the Global Management staff 
member in charge of this job. I spoke with him briefly, and he said he 
expected to have the indices available in Enpower this afternoon. 

Jeff Richter is currently consumed with sorting out EES discrepancies for 
today, but we'll work on the new spreadsheets this afternoon.

I'll keep you posted.

Thanks,
Kate
