Regarding the deal Chris Foster did on 4/6 with Sierra Pacific Holding Co. -

Bob Ellery, Sierra's Director of Energy Resources, and Steve Hall, one of 
Portland's most expeditious lawyers, have decided to execute the deal under 
the designation Sierra Pacific Industries, which is also named in the master 
agreement. We still, however, need this name added to the counterparty list 
in EnPower.

Thank you all for your help on this, and I appreciate your future assistance 
in getting this deal out of the "New Counterparty" void.
