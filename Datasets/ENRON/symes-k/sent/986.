Sharen Cason in the Confirms group will be expecting your phone call. Her 
number is 703-853-3001.

I talked to her about the difference in energy types, to satisfy my own 
curiosity, and she explained that the CAISO modifier acts as a flag to her 
group that the deal was done in California and therefore should have an NP15, 
SP15, or ZP26 delivery point. If the energy type is CAISO, they need to 
include different language in their confirmation letter to the counterparty. 
While CAISO is still essentially firm energy, it has different stipulations, 
she said. 

I didn't go into detail with her, because the bottom line is that none of our 
real time deals should reach the confirms desk anyway. I'm working with IT in 
Houston and here to have West Hourly deals default to "no confirm," but until 
that gets done your best defense from the constant, nagging onslaught of 
petty deal entry error messages is to have your group check and double-check 
that they've marked their deals "NO" under the Confirmation heading. More 
information than you ever wanted on this subject? I thought so.
