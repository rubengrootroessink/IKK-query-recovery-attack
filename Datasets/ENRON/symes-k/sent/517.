Looks like Tom forgot this deal on Friday - I've just entered it. Deal # is 
514006. One thing I didn't check on was whether it was off-peak or on-peak. 
Does this deal check out with APB? Let me know.

Thanks,
kate

I don't see any deals with any of these terms in Tom's trade log for today. 
He's left the office, and I've left him a message on his cell phone - but 
until then, I can't really say if this is good or not. Could it be a Mark 
Fischer deal?
