Thanks! I handed off the fax to Christian, who said he was extremely busy 
today but would try to get to it this afternoon. In the meantime, I've been 
told by Chris Mallory that the most important issue is that all 
index-forwards get uniform confirmation language. As far as what that 
language is, I'm not sure. Is this different than the confirm letters you've 
received in the past? Let me know if you need me to expedite the process and 
get someone else's opinion.

Thanks,
Kate

Kate, I just faxed over the Constellation confirm just in case you need to 
view it. 

Thanks,

Kimberly

I've forwarded this message onto Christian Yoder, one of our lawyers. Chris 
Mallory and Jeff Richter suggested I check with Christian first on the 
language of these confirms. I'll get back to you first thing tomorrow.

Thanks,
Kate

Kate,
I received and index trade into NP15 that Chris Mallory did. For Price the 
confirmations states: 

The average day ahead, post congestion price for the Constrained Price as 
published by the California Power Exchange for the on in the period of 
delivery stated herein plus 3.00.

Is this language o.k. to accept on the confirmation.

Thanks,
