Subject: EWWW TOMATOES!

There are some Las Vegas Delight True Beef Steak tomatoes available by Jody's 
desk.

I wouldn't recommend taking ANY of them, as I'm sure they don't taste very 
good. (Yeah, right!) 

Tomatoes are available in limited quantity, so come and get it!

*NOTE* If you get a tomato that is somewhat green, that means it's probably 
not good. You can put it on my desk and I'll take care of it. =o) 
OR, you can keep it on your counter for a day or two and it'll be ripe and 
ready to go! (I recommend doing the first thing...)
