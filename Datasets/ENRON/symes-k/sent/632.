It's CAISO energy - and I've changed it. I guess some kinks are there to 
stay, huh? I will have a great weekend, thanks - I'm actually having a 
housewarming party at my new house! You have fun too!

Hi Kate,
This deal has an NP-15 delivery point with firm energy.  Which is correct? 
Have a great weekend!
