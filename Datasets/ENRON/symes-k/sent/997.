We just found that the other two options we entered yesterday were NOT, in 
fact, round-the-clock deals. We've changed 547682.2 to on peak hours only, 
and 426659.2 to off peak hours only. All three deals will be included on our 
deal correction report, but I thought I'd give you a heads up.

Thanks,
Kate

Kate, just happened to notice when they entered the leg 2 of the deal 
428861.01.... is it suppose to be 7days a week, 24 hours a day,  the 
428861.01 is off peak hours only.

Thanks
