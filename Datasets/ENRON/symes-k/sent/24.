I took a message from Pat Brown at Avista this morning. She needed to book 
one more spa reservation for Jean Gonnella. The only time Jean can do it is 
between 3:30 and 6 p.m. on the Thursday they arrive. She would like a deep 
cleansing facial and a french manicure. If there isn't time for both, she'd 
just like the facial. Please call Pat and confirm the reservation time when 
you make it. Her number is 509.495.8123. Thanks!

P.S. I don't want you to think I'm passing the buck. I would have taken care 
of this myself, but Mollie said you had a bunch more reservations to make on 
Tuesday morning. Good luck, and let me know if you need help.
