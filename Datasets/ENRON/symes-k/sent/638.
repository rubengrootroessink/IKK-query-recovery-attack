It was great - we ended up having a really eclectic mix of people. You should 
have stopped by! No worries, though, I'm sure we'll have many more. Thanks 
for the info for Molly - I'll pass it along, for whatever it's worth. Also, I 
noticed you hadn't deposited the check yet - if you'd like, I can bring you 
cash at about 11:30 this morning. Just thought maybe that would be easier for 
you. Let me know.

Kate
