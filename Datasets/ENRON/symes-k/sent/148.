Kate, thanks for your review!  I need to send out right away, can we add some 
fun to this mundain (sp) note?


The holiday party is this Saturday!  Please take a minute to review these 
last-minute details, guaranteed to make our holiday party an exercise in 
efficient merriness.....

1. Remember to RSVP.  If you have not done so, please see Kathy Axford or 
Anna Mehrer TODAY.

2. Parking will be provided free of charge. Upon your arrival, tell the 
bellhop you are an Enron guest.  Should you choose to park in the structure 
across Pine Street from the hotel, take the ticket to the front desk for 
validation.

3. Responsible drinking is encouraged.   Complimentary towncar services will 
be provided by our friend Elaina at IMAX Trans.  Please contact her before 
Friday to make arrangements. She can be reached at 503-358-7214, or via 
e-mail at 
imaxtrans@hotmail.com.  Please include your preferred pick-up time and 
address in the e-mail, and Elaina will schedule accordingly.  And remember - 
everyone's in the same holiday boat with an ever-increasing list of gifts to 
get, so your gratuity to the driver is appreciated.

4. Embassy Suites is offering rooms to Enron employees at a special rate of 
$125+tax on Saturday night.  A  breakfast buffet is included (as are those 
little bottles of shampoo and shower caps!).  Please call 503-279-9000 for 
reservations, and be sure to ask for the holiday rate.

Robert Hicks and his seven-piece swing band will provide the musical stylings 
for the evening, so don't forget to bring your dancing shoes. And our very 
own Fank Vickers, auctioneer extraordinaire, will once again bring the house 
to its knees for charity. Amen!

Schedule of Events:
6:00-6:45    Reception, hors d'oeuvre and hosted beverages
6:45-8:00    Dinner Buffet
8:00-9:00    Door Prizes and Auction
9:00-11:30  Dance the night away......

We are looking forward to a great time!

If you have any questions or suggestions, please see your Assistant today.

Thanks.

Mollie
