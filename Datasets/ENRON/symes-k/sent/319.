I've just spoken with Christian Yoder, who said he's got the confirmation 
letters for these deals on his desk. He's also planning to call you to 
discuss this further - these deals and several others entered as part of an 
EES acquisition will all be confirmed differently than usual. I'm not 
completely clear on the subject, so I'm going to defer to Christian's legal 
expertise.

But if you have any other questions, please let me know. I can certainly sit 
down with Christian and maybe we can all conference call on the subject.

Thanks,
Kate

Subject: Avista deals

There are two deals for Avista the are marked not to be confirmed.  Can you 
check into these, and if they are not to be confirmed, put a little note as 
to why or who said not to confirm them, so 6 months from now when someone 
says "Why didn't you confirm this deal!"  I'll have something to jog my 
memory.  (Because I will have slept between now and then!)

Deal Numbers #487050 and 487054

Thanks!
