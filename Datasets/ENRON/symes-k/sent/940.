Melissa - I just wanted to let you know that I can definitely get this list 
to you today. I'm a little buried right now dealing with some IT issues we're 
having with the new Full Service Power application, Forward Obligation 
report, etc., etc., so it may take me a little while. Is it okay if I get 
this to you by 1 p.m. PST? Let me know.

Thanks,
Kate

Hi Kate,  Can you help me determine which traders in Portland are associated 
with each area list below under West Power?  The EOL team needs to run some 
number by trader for Louise Kitchen.

Thanks,
Melissa

We have received a request from/for Louise Kitchen and accounting for a deal 
count breakout for the following areas. Can you provide a list of traders 
that would coinside with the following areas:

EAST POWER
 Southeast (ex: Smith/Sukakly)
 Midwest (Hemdon/Pagan)
 Northeast (Sturm/Baughman)
 Management Book (Presto)
 New Albany (Presto)
 Development (Jacoby)
 Structuring (Aucoin)
 Fundamentals (Will)

WEST POWER
 Origination (Calger)
 QF (Calger)
 Development (Parquet)

 Middle Market/Services (Foster/Wolfe)

If you can let us know which(ALL) traders are associated with these areas, 
then we should be able to create this report for EOL numbers. We appreciate 
any assistance you can provide. 

Thanks,
