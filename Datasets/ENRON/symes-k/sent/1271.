I've left a message for Stewart Rosman, the mid-marketer who did this deal, 
to find out whether or not he wants this confirmed. Diana Scholtes said she 
thought he did, in which case I need to determine with him what kind of deal 
this should be, and we'd need to confirm the first leg. I'll let you know as 
soon as I hear back from him.

Thanks,
Kate

There is a leg 2 for this deal that has come up on the list to be confirmed.  
We did not confirm leg 1 of this deal and I don't think we confirm 
buy/resales as they are like transmission.  Could check into this and let me 
know.

Thanks!
