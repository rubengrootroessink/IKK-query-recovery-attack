You're probably right, Sharen, since the counterparty continues to send 
confirmation letters with FPL Energy Power Marketing instead of Florida Power 
& Light. Unfortunately, the marketer who contacts our trader to transact 
identifies himself as being with Florida Power & Light, which is where I 
believe the confusion is coming from. I'll let the traders know of the 
correct counterparty name, though. 

Thanks for the heads up,
Kate

Can you check with the trader on this deal.  We have had to change several 
deals input with this CP name.  I believe it should be FPL Energy Power Mktg. 
not  Florida Power & Light Company.  I think one is a utility which would be 
local and one is a marketer, who can trade anywhere.

Thanks!
