I've added the third leg to deal 566375 and changed comments in each leg to 
reflect that. We had a bit of confusion about who was actually adding the new 
pub code, but it's in the system now and the deal is ready to be confirmed. 
Just a note - I previously had all the Sunday and Holiday hours in the 
off-peak leg of this deal (so Risk could calc the value correctly), and now 
I've deleted those strips to account for leg 3 which contains only Sunday and 
Holiday hours. Please let me know if anything looks different, other than 
that, on your end.

Thanks,
Kate
