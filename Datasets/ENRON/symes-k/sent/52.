Just FYI -
The tie point and Cal PX deals we uploaded this morning did in fact load as 
Enron Online deals. Oh joy!

I talked to Will Smith, who said he thought he'd heard this complaint before 
and very cordially agreed to take a look at it. I just thought I'd keep you 
informed of the latest episode in what I'm sure will be an award-winning 
series. (How about "The Good, the Bad, and the Cal PX Bridge"?)
