The attached document contains the EPMI average prices for all delivery 
points for Sun., March 25, and Mon., March 26. Please let me know if you have 
any problems opening the document or reading it. The worksheet should look 
identical to the fax I send each day. An additional worksheet shows a detail 
of each deal volume and price. I'm in the habit of excluding the counterparty 
names (to save time) because I'm the only one who looks at this sheet 
normally; but if you'd like me to start e-mailing instead of faxing the 
prices I will begin entering the counterparty names as well.



Thanks,
