I just spoke with Kim Hundl in the Confirms group. She's been told by PGE 
that they do not want confirmation letters sent for daily deals. Apparently 
there are a bunch of these in the system under your desk that are noted to be 
confirmed. The confirms group can change all of these deals to "no confirm," 
but they wanted to double-check with you guys first. Do you agree with PGE, 
or would you like these deals confirmed? Let me know.

Thanks,
Kate
