These deals were entered today under STWH desk - Geir and Mark show as the 
traders on them, but I have a feeling that's incorrect as I haven't seem them 
around this morning. Might let the guys know that when they trade at 
California delivery points - NP15, SP15, ZP26 - the energy firmness should be 
specified as CAISO firm. 

Thanks,
Kate
