 I just received the e-mail regarding your visit to Portland (Monica Lande 
forwarded it to me). Regarding that, I would definitely be interested in 
gaining access to Livelink. Monica explained that Livelink is a system that 
allows one to view confirms, in which case it would greatly benefit my 
position to have access to it. I look forward to your visit, and to working 
with you in the future.

Thanks,
