Mike still has not returned my calls, and is not at work today. I checked 
with Mike Driscoll, Swerzbin's assistant, and he confirmed that 517876 should 
be $300. It's an EES spread, and the other side (deal #517877)  is $313 - is 
that what Amerex is looking for? He also checked into 517891 and found that 
the delivery point should be SP-15. It's been changed.

Let me know if there are further questions.

Thanks,
Kate

517384 - price has been changed to $260
517891 - mike's book shows Palo delivery - desk was wrong - has been changed 
to LTNW
517884 - price has been changed to $300
517876/877 - missing Amerex deals were under wrong desk (STCA) - have been 
changed to LTNW

Also, I entered many of Mike's deals today, but in my rush forgot to re-set 
my Deal Blotter defaults - so the deals went in under Short Term California 
instead of Long Term Northwest. I've changed them all to the correct desk, 
which should clear up the missing deals, and hopefully will make more sense 
for your checkouts. Sorry about the confusion - entering deals for three 
different desks at once gets a little hectic!

Let me know if you have questions.

Kate
