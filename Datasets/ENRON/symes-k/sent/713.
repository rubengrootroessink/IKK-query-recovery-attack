Sharen told me this morning that you guys were waiting on a deal Stewart 
Rosman did with Port of Oakland yesterday and wanted confirmed today. I've 
spoken with a few people here and discerned that the deal wasn't in because 
the counterparty wasn't in the system yet. I took a look and found that Port 
of Oakland had been added, and entered the deal according to the terms 
Stewart sent out in an e-mail yesterday. Deal number is 533916. Thanks for 
waiting.
