That's weird, because nothing traded for nearly that low for April today. 
Mike's exact words were, "there's no way it's $258." So if anyone from Prebon 
is still there, let them know the trader is sticking with his price.

Thanks,
Kate

559066----I just checked with Prebon and for some reason they show price as 
$258.00 on this deal.
559091----Is a good deal with Bloomberg.

Therefore, the only deal in question now is 559066 and Prebon shows $258 as 
price and we show $358.

Please advice.

I'm a little confused - 559066 is a Prebon deal under Mike Swerzbin's book. 
559091 is a Bloomberg deal under Matt Motley's book. I just talked to Mike 
Driscoll and he said these both have the correct brokers on them and there 
were two deals. ????

Kate deal 559066 is identical to deal 559091.  Prebon does not recognize 
559066.  Were these duplicates?

BLOOMBERG
Matt Motley
559091 - sells to Idaho, 50 mw, April, Mid-C, $358

Tom Alonso

He is still entering last two deals.

AMEREX

And Tom said he didn't have anything to do with this deal - Mike said MW were
