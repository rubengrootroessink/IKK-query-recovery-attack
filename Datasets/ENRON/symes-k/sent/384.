Just wanted to let you know I haven't forgotten you. All our traders and 
schedulers have been in a meeting this afternoon, and as soon as they got out 
the frenzy of trading and scheduling began again. I'm going to give things a 
minute to settle down, and then ask around as to how people would like their 
Livelink training.

I'll get back to you soon.

Thanks,
Kate
