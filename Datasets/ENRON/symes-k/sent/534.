hey - how's your sexy body? don't have much time right now, but thought i'd 
drop a line to tell you that i'm so broke i'm considering picking up some 
unmentionable weekend job and therefore cannot make it down there for 
prezzy's day weekend. i'm so pissed! but it will happen soon - and anytime 
you're up here you need to stay with me - we have a guest bedroom for gosh 
sakes. also, i met malia at a party the other weekend - talk about a freakin' 
small world! she was so sweet, but then i'm not surprised - she'd have to be 
to put up with you. (ha, ha) anyway, take care, call me soon, and toast my 
absence with a bottle of wine tonight.
