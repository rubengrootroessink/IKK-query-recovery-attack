I've spoken with Rhonda about this, and I'll be letting the traders know to 
be prepared for the change. This deal has been changed to Allegheny.

Thanks,
Kate

Kate I spoke with Phil about this deal this morning and I just called but he 
away at lunch.

Per our Rhonda, can you tell him that deal 553645 should be changed Allegheny 
Energy Supply and that we should no longer do any deals under Merrill Lynch.  
Also, can you let the schedulers know about the name change of this deal. 


Thanks!
