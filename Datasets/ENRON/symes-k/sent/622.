Matt just talked to his broker and verified the price at $260. If the back 
office doesn't recognize this in the next couple minutes, tell them to TALK 
to Rodney Drake, the Prebon broker who seemed to be quite sure that our price 
was right. I'm sorry this is causing chaos on your end - but sometimes I 
wonder if the brokers are communicating with people in their own office....?

Can you have Matt Call Prebon on this deal?  It has been a very hectic 
morning!!

Please let me know the outcome.

Matt Motley - 524308 in trade log as buy Aquila/May-01/25 mw/Prebon at 
$260.00 - Matt is tied up in conference right now, but judging from the other 
May deals in his blotter and from his curves, this price is correct. $160 is 
about $100 less than anything else trading at that time. Ask Prebon where 
they got that from..
