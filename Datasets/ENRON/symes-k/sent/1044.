Les -
I received this list from the Confirms group this morning. Looks like they 
need quite a few unit names for confirmation purposes. But if I remember 
correctly, you didn't want these deals confirmed. Please let me know when you 
get a chance, and I can go through and either change them to "no confirm" or 
add the unit names. 

Thanks,
Kate

Hi Kate!
Hope you had a good weekend!
We need to know the unit name on these two unit contingent deals for Salt 
River Project.
Thanks!
