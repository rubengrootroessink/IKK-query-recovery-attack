No, this was incorrect. I'll tell you something - Real Time is having 
problems figuring out who they do and do not trade with. We're going to have 
a conversation about this in a minute when I come up for air from this whole 
California mess. In the meantime, I've changed this to Enron Energy Services, 
Inc.

Thanks,
Kate

509402.  Can you see if this is the correct CP.  We don't have a contract 
with them.  If it is correct, that's fine, just let me know.
