I'm so sorry, gals, but I feel awful and I'm going home to nurse myself to 
health. If you could direct your e-mails for the remainder of the day to the 
respective traders, I would really appreciate it. And if anything can wait 
until tomorrow, just e-mail it to me and I'll take care of it in the morning. 
I'm going to sleep for the next 15 hours and see if that rids me of this cold 
once and for all!

Thanks,
Kate
