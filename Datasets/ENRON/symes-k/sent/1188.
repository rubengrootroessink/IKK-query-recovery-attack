Thanks for doing that. And those deals didn't show up in my query because I 
was looking for trades done under the Short Term West Services desk - I 
didn't realize Chris was also entering these under Short Term California. 
Just let me know if there's anything else I can do.

Thanks,
Kate

What about 573679, 579822, 579826 and the 2 transmission deals that are in 
Enpower?  I will change them as soon as Sam gets the CP set up if its okay 
with you.  Then I can tell Kim Hundle to resend the confirms.

Thanks for following up on this, Rhonda. I believe you just spoke with Chris 
about the executed original of this contract. Please let me know what else I 
can do to speed this process along. I ran a search for deals the West 
Services desk has done with this counterparty (which were entered with Sierra 
Pacific Industries, Inc.) and came up with only three deal numbers. They are:

580832
580137
580136

Would you like me to change these over? Or are you doing that along with the 
re-confirmation? Please let me know when you get a chance.

Thanks,
Kate

Because of credit reasons, the name above will remain the name under the 
contract.  Global Counterparty has agreed to set up this dba as listed on the 
contract.  Once this CP has been set up, I will need the trades moved to this 
CP and the deals will need to be reconfirmed in the accurate name.  

If there are no objections, I will move the deals and instruct the confirm 
person to resend the confirms.  I will also move the contract to this new 
name.  Genia will prepare the amendment covering just the change in the 
credit provisions.

If Portland holds the fully executed original, please forward to me at your 
earliest convenience.  If you have any questions or further instructions, 
please contact me at X35871.
