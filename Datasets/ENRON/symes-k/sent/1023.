Following are the deals I changed to the correct time zones, per Will Smith's 
list:

520330 - forward
373613 - forward
359846 - EOL
353314 - EOL
352613 - EOL
349391 - EOL
349389 - EOL
349242 - EOL
330282 - EOL
300686 - forward
272524.2 - forward
220845 - forward

Most of these were just April deals, and it looks like they all suffered from 
the same incorrect default we ran into before. On the longer term deals I 
made sure to choose "no" when it asked if I would like to clear all routes 
for the deal; but let me know if you find anything out of the ordinary.

Thanks,
Kate
