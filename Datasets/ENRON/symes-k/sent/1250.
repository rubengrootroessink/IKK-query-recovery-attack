Don't worry about it! I got home and had to shower the day off of me, and by 
the time I got out Dave was (randomly) walking through the front door. Then 
he and my new roommate Chase and I all had tuna fish sandwiches and 
milkshakes for dinner. It was sooooooo good. And I am soooooo easily pleased. 
It's gorgeously sunny and warm here today, so I might have to go for a bike 
ride after work. Then I've got to ream Amber for being the most pathetic, 
loser roommate on the face of the earth (more on that later.) So we 
DEFINITELY need to talk. I'll call you tonight.

Love,
Kate

Hey,

Sorry I never called last night.  I kept thinking you would call me, then I
fell asleep.  But I'll call you when I get home today, kay?

Anna
