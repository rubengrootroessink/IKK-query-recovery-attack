Does this mean that 598738 should be off peak hours as well? Because 598739 
is only one side of a sleeve deal for EES. I would think that both sides need 
to have the same hours......

Let me know, and I'll change them accordingly.

Thanks,
Kate

598736 and 598737 have been changed to off-peak hours. But I can't pull up 
306927. Is this the right deal number?
