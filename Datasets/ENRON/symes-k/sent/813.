Questions about this deal - 

1. Should energy type be CAISO? 
2. Should trade date be 3/7?
3. Should confirmation status be "NO"?

I believe the answer to all of these is yes, but I wanted to check before 
changing anything. The confirms group is getting extra sensitive about deals 
marked for confirmation, since they are now confirming all daily deals. Just 
a reminder to double-check your default settings and your deals for the 
confirmation status.

Thanks,
Kate
