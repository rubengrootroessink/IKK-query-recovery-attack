Per Greg Wolfe and Valarie Sabo:
Do not verbally confirm these deals. Greg Wolfe is preparing a confirm letter 
himself. Sharen Cason was handling this account with Greg Wolfe, John 
Malowney and Valarie Sabo yesteday, so she would have more detailed 
information. 

Let me know if that does it!

Thanks,
Kate

Hi Kate,
We had a deal with Hinson Power Company, Inc. yesterday that we ended up not 
confirming because the comments said that it was a buy-back of part of a 
one-off deal and that Legal would prepare a special confirm.  There are no 
comments entered for these deals that would indicate that they are the same 
type of deal.  Are they?  Should we prepare a confirm letter?
Thanks!
Kim
