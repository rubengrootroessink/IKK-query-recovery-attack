Hey there - I'm so sorry I haven't responded until now. I've been swamped 
with work, moving, and now the flu. Whoo, hoo! So, as far as gossip is 
concerned, I'm all dried up for now. I was going to go on a company ski trip 
this weekend, but I feel so crappy I can't even imagine being outside, let 
alone surrounded by snow and wind at the same time. I imagine you're totally 
used to that by now, but keep in mind your weather is accompanied by sun and 
not eternal grayness. 

Our house is coming along nicely. Molly and I already want to boot Amber out, 
but that's okay. We deal with it by laughing about her antics whenever 
possible - behind her back or in front of her face. It really helps us out, 
and I think it does wonders for her ego too. Work is work. The weather is 
foul! Men are too. I don't even have one prospect at this point. Of course 
there's always the innocent, fleeting crushes from a distance; but I've got 
to admit I hardly even have the energy for those anymore. 

I hope you can make it home for a visit soon, because you are going to LOVE 
our house. I will definitely keep my eyes peeled for cheap tickets to Denver, 
or maybe I'll just do the train and take a long weekend. Either way, I'll 
definitely make it there by springtime. Tell me about your jobs, friends (or 
not?), and life in general. I'm going to get back to work and hustle so I can 
get out of here early and suffer peacefully at home. I'll give you a call 
from my sick bed, 'kay?

Take care,
Kate
