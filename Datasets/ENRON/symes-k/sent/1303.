Thanks for letting me know about the change in this deal. I looked at the 
audit viewer, and it jogged my memory a bit. Mike originally entered this 
deal as Q2 off peak; then he came over to me the next day and said it should 
have been Cal'03-Cal'04. So we changed it, and it must have messed up the 
strips somehow. Anyway, if it checks out with the broker, that sounds good 
enough for me.

Thanks again,
Kate
