Okay, it's taken me a while to track down the answer on this, but here it is. 
Apparently Greg Wolfe and Tim Belden just signed off on this confirm letter 
and faxed it down to you guys. Greg wasn't sure whose attention it had been 
put to, but hopefully the word got back to you that the confirm language was 
fine and the deal was signed off on. If you need another copy of the 
agreement, let me know.

Thanks,
Kate

Hey Kate! I received a BPA trade that Mike/Greg did and under Special 
Provisions on their confirmation it reads:

This is a remarket of Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Company power. KAC's 
point-to-point transmission agreement will be utilized. KAC's scheduling 
agent may request changes to the delivery point(s) under alternate point of 
delivery capabilities associated with KAC's transmission agreement. BPA shall 
accommodate the scheduling of such changes.

Is this language o.k. ?
