Both deals have been changed - 512924 has been changed to no confirmation. 
512929 has been given a contact name. And thanks for the update on daily deal 
confirmations.

These two deals do not have contacts but are coded to be confirmed.  Can you 
check and see if she does want them to be confirmed and if so, please add 
contacts.

We are still planning on confirming the daily deals in the west, but we have 
run into system problems so we have pushed the start date back a little.  
I'll let you know when we have a definite date.

Thanks!
