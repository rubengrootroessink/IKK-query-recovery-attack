Here you go, Kim. I've added a couple more counterparty names to your list, 
and made a few minor changes that I thought might clarify the reasoning 
behind and origination of these "no confirm" deals. The one counterparty name 
I couldn't recall was Bonneville - do you remember who requested that we not 
confirm these? 

Please let me know if you have any questions on the additions.

Thanks,
Kate

Subject: Not to be confirmed deals

Hi everyone!

I have begun to document all special situations and counterparties that are 
exceptions to our "not to be confirmed" rules.  Thus, in the future, when we 
need to answer questions regarding why certain deals are unconfirmed, there 
will be no confusion about where the directives not to do so originated.

Please review this document carefully.  Go ahead and make any changes that 
you'd like -but please change your font color so that I will know which items 
you have added.  I will incorporate all of your edits to the master document 
and save it to a common drive where it can be accessed and updated whenever 
necessary.

If you can think of any additional "not to be confirmed" 
exceptions/situations, or more specific details  -please add them.  Please 
let me know if you have any questions.



Thanks for your input,
Kimberly Hundl x31647
