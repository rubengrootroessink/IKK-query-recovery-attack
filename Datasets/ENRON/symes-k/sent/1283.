At long last, I've sorted through these deals and determined the source of 
most of these problems. I'll be calling you both shortly to go over these and 
make sure we all see the same thing. Here are a few things to note as you go 
over my responses:

566426 - rates have been changed/has this shown up on your CARP report yet?
578856 - deal done by Real Time trader at hour-ahead market price/will not 
correspond directly to the price shown in my spreadsheet
573862 - rate for this deal should not be $107 OR $168.45/it is an off peak 
sale from EPMI to EES, which means we go by the off peak short position price 
- shown in my sheet as $119.76

The newest deals in this variance list are Real Time. I've double-checked the 
deals in EnPower with what I see in the Real Time spreadsheets, and 
everything seems to match up. I'm attaching those sheets so we can ensure 
we're all looking at the same thing. If you have further discrepancies on 
these, the easiest way for me to clear them up would be if you include the 
specific hours you have questions about.

I'm terribly sorry for the delay in getting back to you on this - it's a 
twisted and time-consuming journey trying to find the source of these 
problems, as I'm sure you know! I hope this gets us up to speed, but please 
call me with questions or comments.

Thanks,
Kate
