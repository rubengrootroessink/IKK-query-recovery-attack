This was one of a slew of deals that one of our schedulers ran across that 
had the wrong time zone in the strips. According to Duong Luu, there was an 
EOL application error that was incorrectly populating deals that flow over 
4/1/01 - the first of day of Daylight Savings Time. Duong said the error has 
since been fixed. But for the incorrect deals, we had to go in and change all 
the strips back to PPT and re-save the deals so the time zones would populate 
correctly. Hope this doesn't cause too much confusion - but nothing should 
change other than that the MWH will be flowing on the correct hours now. Let 
me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Kate

Kate, checking on deal  318870.01, it is an EOL deal and looks like it has 
been changed.  Once an EOL trade is transacted we are not suppose to change 
the deal.  Please let me know why the ch took place.  

Thanks
Stephanie
