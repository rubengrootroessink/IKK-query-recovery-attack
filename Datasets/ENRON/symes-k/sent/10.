In reviewing Jeff Shields' expenses for the previous two months, I have found 
two travel itineraries which came without prices on them. Jessica and Mollie 
have both checked their e-mail and confirmed that the only documents sent did 
not detail the cost of the trip. 

The prices I need are from the following trips:

Itinerary only - August 28, Alaska Airlines, PDX-SeaTac-Helena-SeaTac-PDX, 
Reservation # AS/WXOKNK
 (reservation made August 24)
Itinerary only - Sept. 6 to 7, Delta Airlines, PDX-Salt Lake 
City-Spokane-PDX, Reservation # DL/V2KIC3
 (reservation made September 6)

Thank you so much for your time.
