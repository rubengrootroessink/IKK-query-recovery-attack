550042/550048 - changed to yes confirm - entered by Real Time guy who isn't 
in the habit of day-ahead trade settings

Thanks,
Kate

Brain glitch!  It was two legs of the same deal!

I also found #550042 and 550048 that look like it needs to be confirmed also.

Thanks!

I think this is an issue with Diana's deal entry, because I just asked Sean 
Crandall and he said you can go ahead and confirm all of these deals. I've 
changed the confirm status, and I'll look into it more later this afternoon 
when the traders are less busy. Also, did you mean to write 549903 twice, or 
is there another deal number?

Thanks,
Kate

Subject: Not to be confirmed deals

We came across some deals on the not to be confirmed report that look like 
they should be confirmed.  Can you check and see why these came up not to be 
confirmed.  We thought we had fixed the system so that the daily deals in the 
west would default to be confirmed so I need to know if this was a conscious 
decision or something the comuter is defaulting to.  Am I making sense?  Call 
me if you need to interpret this message!
