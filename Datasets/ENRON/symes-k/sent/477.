I've changed these deals to FPL Energy Power Marketing. Chris wasn't aware of 
the difference.  I'm trying to come up with a summary list or some other kind 
of reminder to send out to the traders today. I.E. is FPL part of Florida 
Power & Light? What's a quick and easy way to determine which counterparty 
you're trading with? 

We've just been bombarded with reports of incorrect counterparty names in our 
deals, and more often than not the traders are unaware of or indifferent to 
the difference. For your sake (and ultimately theirs, since these errors will 
start adding up in the daily correction report), I want to develop a more 
efficient system of checks and balances. If you have any suggestions (other 
than asking the traders to wake up and pay attention!) please let me know 
when you get a chance. I'll just be brainstorming today....in between 
changing incorrect counterparty names!

Thanks,
Kate

Kate, I think these trades are suppose to be FPL Energy Power Marketing in 
Enpower. Currently they are in as Florida Power & Light. I received 
confirmations from FPL Energy Power Marketing. Could you please talk to 
Mallory about the counterparty name.

Thanks!
