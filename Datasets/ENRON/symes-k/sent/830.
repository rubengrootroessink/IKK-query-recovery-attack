I'm curious to know how my lack of recent correspondence translates to a 
neglect of my brainpower. If I didn't know better, I'd say that was a purely 
conceited statement. But, of course, being the buff brain-builder that I am, 
I know it's not.

So how are things "down" there in Seattle? I've been meaning to check in with 
you and Michael to make sure you didn't lose any limbs in the big Quake of 
'01. By the sounds of it you've been left with at least your digits and a 
little imagination, which isn't half bad compared to the poor capitol 
building in Olympia, whose crumbling edifice has turned into another of those 
perfunctory "news" stories begging the question, "Just how much will I ever 
care?" Last evening's t.v. news actually had the bad sense to show footage of 
city construction workers picking their noses atop the dome while a coiffed 
blonde anchorwoman alerted viewers to the "urgency of the building's 
reconstruction" due to its "inability to be inhabited until 2003." Is it just 
me, or do t.v. newspeople seem to act stupid on purpose?

Speaking of stupid, what exactly is walpurgis night? And the Pogues? I 
realize I'm showing my lack of culture here, but curiosity always overtakes 
my elegant facade sooner or later. Speaking of elegant, we're having another 
party! And Amber might actually show up for this one, being that it's purpose 
is to celebrate her birthday. First weekend in April, April 7 to be exact, 
we'll be the proud hostesses of a 25th birthday/costume party. I'd love for 
you and Michael to grace us with your presence, but it sounds like you'll be 
halfway across the globe by then. If plans change, and for your sake I 
certainly hope they don't, give us a call or just drop in on the 7th.

I've got to run - there are energy crises to be mitigated, you know. But drop 
me a message before you take off for wine country. And watch out for falling 
pieces of crumbling buildings.

Kate

Subject: walpurgis night


hey there.

it's not walpurgis night that's coming up but St Patrick's day. That's when
the little leprechaun in me comes out with a vial of food color and turns
the beer of the city green. I also like to fling myself around to the
accompaniment of the Pogues.

i'm just saying hello. Haven't heard from you in a while, which I take to be
a good thing. It means that, like the rest of us, you are using only a
minimal percentage of your brain.

life has been speeding by here like a golden motorcycle. in two weeks I
leave for New Zealand and even more of my destiny. I don't know how long
I'll be gone, but I'm trying not to worry about it. Right now, I'm just
trying to keep from shivering--it's damn cold in here.

okay, enough rambling. obviously, i have nothing to say.

take care,
jordan
