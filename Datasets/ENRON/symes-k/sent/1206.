Hey Kysa - I hope you're still at your computer. Amy's number is 464-7404. 
I'll try to call you in a minute and make sure you got this. And yes, 
dinner's still on, even though I'm feeling motivated to make toast or 
something equally effortless, so come without an appetite. (Just kidding - 
but I'm seriously open to suggestions.)

Kate
464-7486
