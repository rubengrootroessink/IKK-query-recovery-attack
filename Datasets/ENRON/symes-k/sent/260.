I've forwarded this to Bill Williams III, Real Time manager, who asked to be 
notified of problems and discrepancies with Short Term West Hourly deals. 
I'll change these deals in the system; meanwhile, Bill's going to talk to 
Geir about using the correct counterparty name. 

Thanks for catching that.

Kate

There are several deals in the system for this month under this CP name.  If 
this is supposed to be Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, please 
change these deals and let me know when they have been changed.  There have 
never been any deals under LADWPPX and I would like to inactivate if we are 
not going to use this record ofr the California PX.  Please research and let 
me know.
