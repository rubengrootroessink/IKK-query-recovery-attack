Here's the correspondence between Evelyn in the Houston Confirms group and 
Paul Callahan at Bloomberg outlining the broker's new $15-per-trade fee. 
Please let me know if you have questions or would like me to talk to someone 
at Bloomberg about this. I'll also check with Tim to find out if the fee 
change was ever negotiated with Enron.

Thanks,
Kate

That is the commission for those trades. The rate that Bloomberg Powermatch
now charges for cash trades is $15 per trade.
