How in the hell do you get out of work at 3:45? Well, you've inspired me - 
I'm going to haul ass home and maybe make it there by 6 pm - whoo-hoooooo! 
But seriously, call me tonight if you get a chance. If not, I'll try you (if 
I can dig up your home number somewhere) or call when you get into town this 
weekend. I'll be around, so we HAVE to hang out at least once. 'Kay? Or I'll 
just stalk you. 'Kay? Take care.

Love,
Kate
