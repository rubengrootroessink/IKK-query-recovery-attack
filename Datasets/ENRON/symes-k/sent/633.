How did you know Steve Smith would be my first choice for a Blazer date? 
Maybe I'm not as original as I thought I was.

Anyway, I think you've got it straight. Mollie is the administrative 
assistant in charge of ordering and paying for season tickets for the 
Origination group. I'm a trader's assistant  who once worked for Mollie and 
stole the Blazer responsibility out from under her nose. We still cross paths 
every now and then, so anything that comes to me will get to her. 

Thanks for taking such good care of our sporting needs. And you have a great 
weekend too. Don't forget to take a moment of silence for our past Presidents 
on Monday.
