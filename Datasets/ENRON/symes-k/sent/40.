What better time to start thinking about the winter holidays than on 
Halloween?!

Just a reminder that our happy little office will be hosting a Holiday Party 
& Benefit Auction on Saturday, Dec. 2, beginning at 6 p.m. and lasting until 
the wee hours of the morning. We hope that everyone will be able to attend, 
which is why we're reminding you while the smell of pumpkin-insides and candy 
corn is still fresh in the air.

We will be holding a benefit raffle and auction again this year, and all 
proceeds will once again be matched by Enron Corp. Donations will be divided 
between Portland's Raphael House, a shelter for battered women and their 
children, and the Court-Appointed Special Advocates, a group that assists 
foster children and at-risk youth throughout the court process.

But who said charity couldn't be a hoot? There will be a pangea of prizes and 
a gaggle of goods for everyone (think Blazer tickets and autographed Blazer 
basketballs!). And a BAND! A swing band! It will prove to be the most 
fantastic Holiday Party this office has ever had....
