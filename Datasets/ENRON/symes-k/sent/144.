Mom -
I know how if feels when things start building like that. I'm finding that 
"alone time" is really the only way to cope - especially during the holidays. 
But don't worry about getting upset - you have every right. I am really sorry 
that I haven't helped you with Anna's finances, but I've felt so overwhelmed 
just making it to and from work everyday that I haven't managed to fit in 
much more. Just when I think I might be getting on top of things, I do 
something like lose my glasses, which then takes priority over everything 
else I thought I would finally be able to do, as I cannot see a word I'm 
typing at the moment. IThe madness is neverending! I hope it's comforting to 
know that no one has it anymore together than you do.

Kate
