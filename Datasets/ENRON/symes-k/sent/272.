Sorry for the confusion, Geir. When I got the e-mail from Houston it gave me 
the deal numbers and your name - I didn't even look in the comments section. 
My fault! If you let Porter know the correct counterparty shortname, that 
would be great. Thanks for your help.

Kate

Hey

Just for the record I would like to make clear that I did not enter these 
deals. Our new trader  uses my tradee id when I work with him.( He writes 
entered by ......   in the comment section. I will point out the mistake to 
him so we can make sure it does not happen again.

Geir
