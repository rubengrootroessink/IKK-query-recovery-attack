Here's the latest I've heard from EES regarding ways in which we've managed 
to thoroughly confuse them. I'm researching most of these questions, but as 
with last month, there are a few Real Time deals they don't see in the 
spreadsheet you guys send to them. Would you mind checking this out when you 
have a minute (or despite the fact that you don't)? If you revise anything, 
just let me know or e-mail it directly to Mark Confer and Brooklyn Couch.

Thanks,
Kate

Kate, I looked over the list below and 90% of them look easy, just a few 
updates to the schedule or real time sheets and April activities will be well 
on the way.

Please let me know what you think, If I can help from this end I will be glad 
to.


Thanks, Mark
