Yes - I finally reached someone at Avista who had been working on the problem 
as well. She filled me in on a few things, and I straightened out the story 
with our broker. It turned out to be Avista's fault - they failed to report 
to their broker that we paid them for a futures contract, and that triggered 
a domino effect of payment inquiries. We did pay, and the record shows that.

Thanks for following up!

Kate

I did call you back yesterday on the Avista thing, but you were in a 
meeting.  Did you ever find the deal or get an answer?
