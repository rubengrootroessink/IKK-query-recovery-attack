I've been working with Laura Wente to locate these documents for a couple 
days, and I think I've found what you need. If you could call or e-mail with 
your fax number, I'll send what I have over to you and expedite the process. 
If you'd like to peruse the EIS documents online, go to 
www.tis.eh.doe.gov/nepa/ and click the heading DOE NEPA Analyses.

Please let me know if I can be of further assistance. My phone number is 
503.464.3748.
