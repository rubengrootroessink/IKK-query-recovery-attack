So I watched the news last night and discovered to my utter dismay that the 
whole damn city of Seattle began rioting over my pointed absence this 
weekend. Some people just don't know how to control those emotions, I guess.

How was dinner, anyway? I was actually hoping to come, but I seem to have 
misplaced Michael's phone number and so had no way of contacting you guys. 
Also, I wasn't quite confident in my ability to find your house through 
"alternative" methods such as hanging out at the train station or wandering 
through Microsoft millionaire-type neighborhoods. And to top it all off, I 
lost my voice Friday night - for no apparent reason other than the usual 
deficit of sleep and surplus of cigarettes - and wouldn't you know it would 
have to turn into a full blown cold by this morning. 

As can be expected, we're experiencing the most insanely gorgeous weather 
I've seen in all my Februarys in Portland, which is making my acceptance of 
actually being sick even more difficult. Whatever happened with your fever? 
I'd feel much better if I knew others were sharing my pain. In fact, I 
promptly gave my cold to Amber on Saturday, so I'd have a partner in my time 
of homebound misery. She took it a step further, in true drama queen fashion. 
Case in point - I'm at work, she's rounding out her 39th consecutive hour in 
bed. 

Anyway, I'm going to skip out of here a whopping half an hour EARLY today 
because people are starting to look visibly pained when I try to talk. But I 
thought I'd check on the success of the dinner party and apologize for not 
making it. And if you get a chance, tell Michael that I have a very 
legitimate reason for losing his phone number. Or at least, I'll have one by 
the time he calls.
