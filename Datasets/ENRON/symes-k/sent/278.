This deal was a sleeve done for EES, and we've had problems with the trade 
dates on these before. EES reported this trade to us on 12/6/00, and it was 
Matt Motley's understanding that the trade was executed the previous day. He 
doesn't care either way, but he suggested you talk to someone at EES - maybe 
Jubran Whalan or Neil Bresnan - about what their intent was with the date.

In the meantime, I can change the date to 12/4 if you'd like. What would be 
best? E-mail or call and let me know.

Thanks a lot!
Kate @ 503-464-7486
