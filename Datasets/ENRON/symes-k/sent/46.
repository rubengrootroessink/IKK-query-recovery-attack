Happy Monday - or whenever it is that you are blessed with the receipt of 
this message. A funny thing happened to me on my way to upload the PX deals 
on Friday. I went to process the data and was rudely stopped by an error 
message stating the following:

Error establishing lock on Trader ID and Trader Date: Trader Already Locked 
(_InboxAC11AC92.913Aoc376A1622250.4) 

Interesting, isn't it? So I entered the PX deals manually and went along my 
merry way. Just thought you should know.
