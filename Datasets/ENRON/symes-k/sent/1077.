I just finally heard back from the traders on this deal. Apparently, Idaho's 
schedule was cut by the ISO on Sunday, and therefore, we had to cut our sale 
to them. The deal was originally 25 mw on peak, but was cut about 10 mw each 
hour. That's why each hour now shows 15 mw and some scraps. The remainder of 
the schedule we sold in the hour ahead market. This is a typical maneuver 
when the ISO cuts schedules, but I guess you guys haven't had to confirm 
daily deals in this situation before. Let me know if this is going to be a 
problem, and we'll figure something out.

Thanks,
Kate
