This deal is a placeholder for our futures position that rolled off 
yesterday. We're awaiting our counterparty match-ups, which I asked Jason 
Fischer about yesterday. He said the broker wouldn't have those until today. 
I'll let you know once we've changed the deal accordingly.

Thanks,
Kate

There is a deal titled NEW COUNTERPARTY.  Do you know what the name is 
supposed to be?

Thanks!
