I received a message today from one of the brokers at ED&F Mann, who said he 
was waiting on our payment for a Palo Verde futures contract for April. I 
remember something like this happening last month, and I remember you two 
coming to the rescue, which is why I'm asking for your assistance. If either 
of you get a chance on Monday, let's get together and figure out why this 
hasn't been paid, or maybe why it HAS been paid and not received.

I believe the deal in question is 531782 - Long Term Southwest buys from 
Avista for the month of April, price $196, trade date 2/26. Doesn't this seem 
eerily reminiscent of the last contract that ED&F Mann didn't receive payment 
on? Was it Avista that time too?

The contact at ED&F Mann is Martin, and his number is (212) 566-9329. Just 
let me know when you have a moment to talk.

Thanks,
Kate
