I just added it. I don't know why, but I checked Jeff's Deal Blotter and he 
had entered the broker. For some reason this did not transfer over into Deal 
Entry. Sorry!

First deal is 481433. Jeff Richter entered this awhile ago.

Second deal is 481489. Sean Crandall forgot to put the broker in - he's 
adding that right now.

Thanks,
Kate
