All these have been changed to CAISO firm energy, and deal 576511 has been 
changed to Reliant Energy Services. Thanks for catching these. I'm forwarding 
this e-mail on to the Real Time group (again) as a reminder.

Thanks,
Kate

Hello!

These deal have NP/SP delivery points with firm energy.
576522
576512
576523
576517
576513
and 576511, but this one is also the wrong CP name.  Reliant HLP doesn't 
trade in the west.  I think it should be Reliant Energy Services.

Thanks!
