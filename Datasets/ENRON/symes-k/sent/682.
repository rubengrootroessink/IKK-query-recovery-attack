Kate, can you please ask Holli if she has a copy of the following 
confirmation(s) Deal 420554.01, 420563.01 (probably confirmed together).  
Sharen Cason worked on the confirmation letter, but we never received a copy 
for our records.  Can you please send us a copy of the Confirmation Letter so 
we can properly scan the document in our system.  Thank you for your help.
