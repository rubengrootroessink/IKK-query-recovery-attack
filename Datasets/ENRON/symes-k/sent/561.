These deals have a contact name - Don Imamura - in them now. I asked Tracy 
Ngo, our credit person, about NCPA's credit status, and she said that since 
they've been done, it's now a matter of risk management or damage control - 
if it should even come to that. At any rate, the deals are good and now have 
contact info.

Thanks,
kate

There are 4 deals for Northern CA Power Agency and they have wonderful notes 
about confirming them together.  However, I need a contact name, and isn't 
NCPA on the credit watch list?

Thanks!
