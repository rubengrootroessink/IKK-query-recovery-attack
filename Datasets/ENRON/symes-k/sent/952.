After the day's confusion has settled down, I can't quite remember if you're 
the one who called me on this deal. It's a short term west hourly deal and 
there was some indication it should be with PPL Montana and not Montana 
Power. Bill Williams, real time manager, told me they trade with Montana 
Power all the time, so this trade should be good. I've changed the deal to no 
confirm, and we're working with IT to get the deal entry settings to default 
to no confirm for all real time deals (so hopefully this won't happen again). 
Call me if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Kate
