You're right. This deal does not need to be confirmed again, says Monica 
Lande. I'll change it in the system as soon as our calc is done today - about 
4:30 p.m. PST.

Thanks,
Kate

I think this deal should have been entered as "no confirm."  Can you please 
change it?  If I am wrong, please let me know. 
Thanks!
