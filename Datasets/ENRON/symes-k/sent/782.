I've got one more deal that Houston says they haven't received a signed 
confirm letter for - 420529. Stephanie Piwetz says she spoke to Grant County 
and they said they already sent out that one and 432854, but haven't received 
them back from us......???? Do you know where they are?

Kate


(From 2/26/01)
Just something to keep in mind - 
The confirms group in Houston is waiting on signed confirm letters from Grant 
County for the following three deals -

432854
420554
420563

I've let Stephanie Piwetz and Sharen Cason know that you'll forward the 
letters on to them once you receive them. Or you can give them to me and I'll 
fax them over. Keep me posted on the progress.

Thanks,
Kate
