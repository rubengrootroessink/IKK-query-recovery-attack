I would be very interested in finding out more about the Deal Control 
position and what it entails. Coming from a background in print journalism 
leaves me somewhat at a loss for practical experience; however, I make up for 
skills in my ability to learn quickly and work aggresively. I'll come by 
sometime today to talk further about this opportunity. Thanks for the notice.
