So, I got the scoop from Phil, and he says that YOU called him and told him 
the Riverside deal would be decreased to .55 from the usual .8 - go figure! 
Also, it looks like Jeremy just missed the .8 mw of generation in the 4/15 
and 4/16 sheets, which in turn I did not include in your sheet. I've revised 
it and attached the spreadsheet, but please let me know if you have any other 
questions.

Hey Kate,

For 4/15 and 4/16, our schedules that we sent you show a Riverside 
Generatioin component of 0.8 every hour (SP15).  This is not reflected in 
your current April update.  The EnPower columns for these days should be 
increased by 0.8 for every hour.  Right?

Also, The generation component that I sent you for Wednesday and Thursday 
(which I sent Monday morning) had a generation component of 0.8.  In reality, 
it was actually 0.55.  I didn't have the generation schedule from Riverside 
and had to assume a value so I assumed it would be 0.8 because that's where 
it had been for a while.  In your current file, you have the correct value of 
0.55.  How did you know this?  Did Riverside call you to tell you they were 
at 0.55 instead of 0.8?  Let me know.  Thanks.

Dan
