Here's the latest I've heard from Diana regarding the deals with a PGE 
delivery point. The four you e-mailed me this morning are all daily deals 
with PGE and therefore do not need to be confirmed, so they are entered 
correctly. I believe Kim Hundl and I discussed this before; but let me know 
if you have further questions.

Thanks,
kate

I just heard the same.  I was talking to Tim about the requirements being 
made regarding daily confirmations, and the final decision was not to confirm 
PGE daily deals.  Question though,  when we put deals into the system in 
Blotter, they automatically confirm.  Do we have to go into every deal and 
switch the flag or is there a better way around it?
