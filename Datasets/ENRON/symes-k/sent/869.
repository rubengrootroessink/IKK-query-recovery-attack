I've changed 549777 to CAISO energy, but 550838 looks like it already has 
CAISO energy in it. Let me know if it was a different deal number that had a 
problem. And you're right - that's not bad at all!

Thanks,
Kate

Hi Kate,
Deals #549777 and #550838 are both firm with sp-15 delivery points.  that's 
all for now though.  not bad so far, huh?
Thanks,
Kim
