All of these deals have been changed. We had a problem with Mark's defaults 
this morning.

Thanks,

This is an automated function of Deal Blotter. I have called Will Smith to 
let him know it's malfunctioning; but all deals not using NP15, SP15, or ZP26 
should default to Firm Energy. I've also changed the energy to Firm in Deal 
#458255. If you could let me know the other deal numbers that need to be 
changed, I'll follow up with those too.

Thanks,
Kate

Hello-
Looks like alot of Mark Fischer's west deals are coming over as CAISO firm 
energy, for example deal 458255.01.  Please change, needs to be Frim Energy, 
we will need to revise the Confirmation Letter.  CAISO energy on NP 15, SP 
15, and Zp 26 delivery points only.

Thank you
Stephanie
