Thanks for checking. I entered this deal today and am still getting used to 
all the different variations of company names. You're right - it's El Paso 
Merchant.

Thanks,
Kate

Hi Kate!
I just want to make sure that this is the correct counterparty name.  Usually 
we trade with El Paso Merchant Energy, L.P.  Is this name entered correctly?
