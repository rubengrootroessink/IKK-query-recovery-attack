You're right - Mike Driscoll entered this incorrectly, so I killed deal 
563929 and simply added three new legs to the existing deal they were trying 
to extend. Deal number 476578 now has legs 4, 5, and 6 to extend the deal 
under the same terms through April. Please let me know if this doesn't show 
up correctly for some reason.

Thanks,
Kate

I have a question about how this deal is entered.  It is a 24 hour deal 
against an index.  Shouldn't it be split out and priced against the 
individual on peak, off peak and Sunday index?

Thanks!
