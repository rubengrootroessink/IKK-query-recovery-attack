I've had a request from Matt Motley to begin receiving this table on a daily 
basis. Carla Hoffman said Bob Badeer had asked for it before, and for 
whatever reason she held off distributing it to all the traders.

I'd like to know if there is some reason why we don't send the EOL table to 
all the traders on a daily basis. If not, may I copy them on this in the 
future?

Thanks,
Kate
