I've been keeping track of this with Tracy Ngo, our credit gal, and the last 
thing I heard on it this morning was that it's still pending credit. Tracy is 
in a meeting right now, but I'll grab her as soon as she gets out (she sits 
next to me) and find out what the status is. Unfortunately, Tracy said when a 
deal is "pending credit approval" it's a little vague as to when the decision 
will be made. Mike Swerzbin told her last night that he wasn't concerned 
about whether or not the deal was approved, so without the trader on credit's 
case, I think sometimes deals get lost in the shuffle. But I'll keep on top 
of it and let you know this afternoon.

Thanks,
Kate

this deal is contingent on credit - he'll let me know later today whether or 
not it's a good trade.

thanks,
Kate

Prebon sent over a confirm for a deal where:
Enron (Mike Swerzbin) buys from PPL Montana Cal'04-Cal'06 25 mw of Mid-C at 
$45.00 off-peak hours.

They did not tell me about this deal during checkout.  Can you please check 
with Mike.

Thanks!!
