Apparently, these are deals we entered in an attempt to cancel an existing 
contract with Hinson - so they are not actual purchases of power, which I 
believe is where the confusion over the confirm letters began. Christian is 
working on the legal aspect of how best to confirm these "deals," but as is 
so often the case with these guys (and especially around the holidays), they 
slipped out of the office before giving me an answer. So we'll get this done 
tomorrow morning. I'm sorry for the delay!

Thanks,
Kate

Hi Kate,
Deals #478168, 478944, 478945, 478946 are to be confirmed by either Greg 
Wolfe or Christian Yoder.  We need to get the final copy of these confirm 
letters so we can scan them into the system for our files.  Also, if the 
finalized confirm has been sent to the counterparty we need to change the 
status in the system.  These deals are still showing up on our "New" report 
every morning and I need to do something with them.
Thanks for your help!
Kim
