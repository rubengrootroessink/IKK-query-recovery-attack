Thanks - I've changed it. With deals like those, it's fine if you need to 
change the counterparty name in the interest of time or efficiency. Could 
just send me a quick e-mail, and copy Bill Williams III (real time manager), 
when you change deals under the Short Term West Hourly desk? That way we can 
both keep on top of common mistakes. And if it's at all possible for you to 
wait on making those changes until you've e-mailed me, that would be great. 
If I don't respond right away - if I'm out of the office or at lunch - then 
feel free to change away!

Thanks,
Kate

I'm not finding anything in Enpower that matches that deal number. Is it 
something else?

As you know, we do not have a contract with Transalta Energy Marketing Corp. 
but with Transalta Energy Marketing (US) Inc.  I am changing this deal to 
that CP.  

Let me know if you have any objections or if you prefer to make the change 
yourself.  Do you want me to continue to let you know of these changes?  I 
know Carla preferred to make the changes herself.
