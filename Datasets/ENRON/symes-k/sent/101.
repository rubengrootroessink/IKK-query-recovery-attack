I sure will - and you're about right. My first free minute should be in 
approximately 12 years. See you then!

Subject: auction stuff

Kate,

When you get a minute (at 8:00 tonight?), would you, please show Theresa and 
I were the auction stuff is in Word?  I am going to have her call the vendors 
we haven't hear from (the majority of them) on Monday.

Thanks!

Mollie
