Tom and Mark are not spot traders, they're cash traders. This is what I was 
referring to yesterday - that Real Time is now being charged $15 for trades - 
but cash and term traders should still be charged the traditional $.005. Why 
is Bloomberg recognizing these trades as Real Time?

Hi Kate, per our discussion on yesterday about the $15.00 flat fee on Tom's 
and Mark's deals, here is Bloomberg's response.  Please pass this info to all 
of our traders.  Please let me know what the response is from them.

Thanks
