The last two LTNW deals - 349864 and 318870 are changed to correct time 
zones. They gave me the option to choose "no" for rerouting of schedules. 
They were both EOL deals.

I just ran a forward ob for April 2 to check for deals that are in PST when 
they should be PDT. 
 
Do you want to change all of these to PPT deals, or do you have time 
constraints today?  I need these changed today because we are already setting 
up for April.

I am particularly worried about how these are corrected because they are long 
term transmission deals that cannot be autoscheduled.
