That sounds like a good one, mom. Like I've said before, I think it's a great 
idea and would be perfect for you. Now I think you should start taking steps 
to make it happen. I know you could get your house sold, no problem. And you 
should think seriously about putting it on the market soon, as I'm starting 
to get the feeling it can take quite a while to actually sell a house. Let me 
know how I can help - for example, Brian has some friends who rent out a 
great cottage in Kihei for $100 a week. He can also get really good deals on 
rental cars. If you start shopping around for a cheap ticket now, you could 
take a scouting trip this spring and make plans to move by the following 
winter - just in time for whale-watching. 

Just do it!
