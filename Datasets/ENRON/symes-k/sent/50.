Thanks. I just checked Peoplefinder and all the new information is in there. 
One thing I couldn't change, however, was my department and supervisor. This 
may have to be changed by HR or my new supervisor; but at any rate, I now 
work in West Power Trading and report to Jeff Richter and Tim Belden.

Thanks for your help.
