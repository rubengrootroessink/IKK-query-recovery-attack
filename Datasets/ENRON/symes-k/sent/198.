I don't know if you saw my second e-mail, but I checked it out with Chris 
Mallory, who did the deal, and he verified the price at $214.95. If Prebon 
still disputes this, let me know and I'll have Mallory talk to Prebon.

Thanks,
Kate

This is actually deal #471975, which I just fixed because Jeff forgot to put 
the broker name in there. It is with Prebon.

Thanks,
Kate
