Yes - I was also going to mention that I talked with Christian Yoder about 
this, and he confirmed that the counterparty name in the contract is The City 
of Oakland, a municipal corporation acting by and through its Port of Oakland 
board, and on and on and on. So we'll be using that name, NOT the Port of 
Oakland, when doing deals with this counterparty. And out of curiosity, does 
anyone you know of trade with simply the Port of Oakland?

Thanks for following up,
Kate

I've changed the counterparty name to The City of Oakland - and the contact 
is Wing Lau. His number is (510) 627-1457. According to Stewart Rosman, the 
middle marketer who did this deal, City of Oakland is the same entity as Port 
of Oakland; however, City is the counterparty name in the system which is 
linked with the correct contact info. I tried to look up the contract in 
Livelink, but I keep getting an error message. Is there any way you can check 
on this contract to make sure we're entering these deals with the correct 
counterparty name?

Thanks,
Kate
