Yes, the following trade was cancelled, Bloomberg failed to send a 
cancellation.  Called Bloomberg, spoke to Trish, and she emailed me a 
cancelled copy.  Thanks
Stephanie

According to all the guys at the Long Term Northwest desk, this trade was 
cancelled by Bloomberg. Let me know if Bloomberg still thinks it's good, and 
I'll have the traders call over there.

Thanks,
Kate
