Looks like a real time guy put this deal in - along with three others - for 
El Paso. Real Time isn't used to marking confirms on their deals, since 
they're usually just trading hour-ahead. Let me know how you'd like these to 
be changed (i.e. "yes-agreement" or "yes-counterparty to send confirm"), and 
I'll do that right away.

Thanks,
Kate

This deal looks to me like it needs to be confirmed, but it was marked no 
confirm.  Do you know of a reason why it shouldn't be confirmed?  If not, I 
need a contact name so that i can send out a letter on it.
Thanks!
