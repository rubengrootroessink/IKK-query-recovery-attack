So I don't need to do anything in order to be a part of the "cash balance 
plan"? When I pull up my account information from the "Savings Plan" website, 
it says my investments and balances are zero, so I assume I need to enroll in 
this myself if I want to be a part of it. The plan I'm referring to allows 
you to invest up to 15% of your before-tax income in either Enron Corp stock 
or a variety of mutual funds. In this plan, up to 6% of your contributions 
are matched by Enron, beginning one month after your hire date. I guess my 
question is - What is this plan called? And if I enroll in it myself online, 
will I be doubling up on something Enron has already done for me? If this is 
not the retirement plan, what is?

I'm sorry to ask so many trivial questions. I just want to make sure I've 
taken advantage of all the programs and not neglected opportunities because I 
thought they were automatically given to me.

Thanks,
Kate

Kate - 

401K and the cash balance retirement plan are 2 separate plans.  You are 
automatically enrolled in the cash balance plan - you would be eligible to 
participate for the year 2000.  Going forward, at the end of each year, Enron 
will set aside 5% of your salary into an account (Enron directs these 
funds).  This account has a 5 year vesting period meaning that you must stay 
with the company for 5 years to be eligible to receive these funds when you 
leave. 

Does this help?

Amy

I'd like to enroll in the Enron Savings Plan program; however, when I was 
navigating through the savings plan website, I started wondering if the 
retirement plan and the self-directed brokerage account are the same thing. I 
think you probably have some information regarding these plans. Could I 
borrow that later this afternoon, or even better, sit down with you for a 
minute to clarify which plans I am eligible to enroll in and when? Thanks in 
advance for your time.

Kate
