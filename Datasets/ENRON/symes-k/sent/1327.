I notified Jim Fell and Terrell Gault of the delay in getting the documents 
to them, and Jim actually said he had both the Business Plan and the EIS and 
therefore didn't need either. Hopefully the Business Plan will arrive from 
BPA today and I'll send it off to Terrell.

Also, I'm sorry about the errors on the place cards. I was in a hurry to get 
them out to Sir Not-So-Speedy and overlooked those details. I hope it didn't 
cause too much confusion.
