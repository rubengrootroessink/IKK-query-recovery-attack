Please join me in welcoming Angela Cadena and Mike Danielson to Enron North 
America.

Angela has joined West Origination as a senior specialist. She comes to us 
from Toronto, Canada, where she did work in merchant banking for OMERS, a 
large pension fund, as well as investment banking and project finance for TD 
Securities. She is most proud of her latest project - a 15-month-old baby 
girl named Maxim. 

Mike has been with Enron for more than two years in East Origination and 
Enron Online. He will be based in San Francisco as a Director for West 
Origination. Mike hails from Florida and comes to us most recently from 
Houston. Please introduce yourself and make him feel at home on his frequent 
Portland visits.
