Following are the prices for fixed sales between EPMI Short Term California 
and EES for 1/25. Chris Mallory has turned this task over to me, and I'm 
working from my own spreadsheet, which I inadvertently deleted this morning. 
Please let me know if you'd like a copy of the spreadsheet as well as the 
prices each morning, or if the prices are sufficient. 

NP-15
 On Peak - $273.50
 Off Peak - $204.43

SP-15
 On Peak - $216.53
 Off Peak - $189.35

Thanks,
Kate
