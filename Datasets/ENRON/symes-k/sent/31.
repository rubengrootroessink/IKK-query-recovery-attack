Whatever she's making now is not enough. Vickie Aldous went above and beyond 
the call of duty, not only locating, copying and expediting the article to 
me, but all within two days of my request. And it was for a good cause - 
we'll be donating the proceeds from our holiday party/auction to the 
Court-Appointed Special Advocates (CASA). Last year the proceeds went to 
Emanuel Children's Hospital - $20,000 from auction attendees plus matching 
dollars from Enron Corp. resulted in a hefty check.

I'm sorry we didn't connect while you were in Portland. I got the message on 
Monday and figured it was a little too late by then. Hope the reunion went 
well. I'm scrambling to be svelte and successful by my 10-year high school 
reunion, which descends upon me in less than four years. I know I'll need at 
least that much time, having spent four years of my life with that bunch of 
overachieving Catholic girls.

I just had a surprise visit from some Ashland friends on Tuesday, replete 
with an extra ticket to see Santana at the Rose Garden. What an awesome 
concert! I must say I'm thoroughly enjoying city life again. But I'll need to 
come to Ashland soon for a dose of good old-fashioned familiarity.

So, I guess this was the long way of saying yes, I got the article, and thank 
you so much for such indispensible help.
