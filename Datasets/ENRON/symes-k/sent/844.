Thank you! I was so baffled for a minute there - when I said "April option" 
every trader just looked at me like I was crazy!

i just called the backoffice at natsource, the brokers weren't answering.  
and apparently it is not a good deal.  so don't worry about it.  thanks.

Natsource is going to have to give you a trader name on this because I've 
asked all of them and nobody recognizes it.
