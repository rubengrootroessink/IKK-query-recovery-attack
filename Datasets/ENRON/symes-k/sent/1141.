I spoke with Chris, and he called Alicia who said she still believes the deal 
should be for April, not May. Chris said they are in a dispute at this point, 
because he believes the term should be May. So he asked me to leave the deals 
alone for the moment, and he will be in touch later today. Would you like me 
to make a note of this in the comments sections of the deals?

Kate

Kate, 
I called Alicia Izarraraz from Atlantic to verbal trades and she was 
inquiring about the term of trade, May delivery, she thought they were going 
to be for April delivery. Deals 576274.01, 576275.01.  Kate, can you ask 
Chris to call regarding inquiry.  Her cell phone is 949-637-4878, her desk 
number 562-499-3201 she said she will be out if the office soon.  No broker, 
done direct.
Thanks
