Here's what I've come up with so far on these deals. There are just two more 
that are going to require a little bit more attention - 566426 and 566391 - 
the SP-15 deals for 4/2. I'm sorry it's taken me a few days to get back to 
you on this. Please let me know what you think, and we'll go from there.

Thanks,
Kate
