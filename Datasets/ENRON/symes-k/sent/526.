I'm sending a copy of the error message I received when I tried to enter our 
futures deals today. The application saved one deal, but 
would not accept the other two. The only difference between the three deals 
is the delivery month. Is there any way we can get this fixed soon? 
The clearing broker has had a record of these deals since Jan. 31, and the 
trader is getting a little antsy to have them recorded in our 
system. Thanks so much for your help....
