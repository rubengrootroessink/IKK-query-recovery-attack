Thanks for the update, Ryan. I've forwarded the e-mail along, and hopefully 
you'll continue to get a good response from all the Blazer fans here. I had a 
chance to catch last night's game - if you could call it that - against the 
Kings. Now all we have to do is pull a Tonya Harding on Chris Webber and 
we've got a chance at the championship! 

I also thought I'd mention that I'm no longer in the same position with 
Enron. I moved into commodity trading a few months ago, so TECHNICALLY I'm 
not the point of reference for Blazer matters - Mollie Gustafson is. I've 
retained the title only because I happen to be the most outspoken fan on the 
floor; so I love receiving all the latest news. But if you ever have a more 
urgent matter, or, for example, when it comes time to renew our season 
tickets, you'll want to call Mollie. She's the woman with the checkbook, so 
to speak. 

In the meantime, feel free to contact me with news about deals, discounts, 
free tickets, a date with the team, etc. (ha,ha)
