I'm sorry - I haven't been keeping up with the Dow Jones data storage. I can 
put the data in the sheet - I just need to take a look at how you've set it 
up and determine what I should be entering where. I'm running to grab some 
lunch right now, but when I get back let's talk about how to compare the Dow 
Jones volumes with our daily volumes. I can either send you my data sheet 
each afternoon, or add a Dow Jones volume table to the sheet myself - however 
you'd like. We'll talk.

Are you going to put the data in the sheet, or are you not able to do that.  
If not, just send the sheet to the file, and I will do it.

Also, I want to get with you about your daily deal data, because I want to 
run a Dow volume vs our volume data set daily.
