Evelyn, I'm so sorry I haven't found these deals yet! I've left messages with 
Mike Swerzbin and Matt Motley, but I don't see these trades in either of 
their logs - or even in the short term trade logs. One of those guys should 
be back in the office momentarily, and I'll let you know when I've talked to 
them.

Kate
