Chris Foster checked and couldn't find anything regarding these deals. His 
take on it was that if Stewart needed them confirmed, he would have passed 
the message along to someone else or left record of the deals numbers 
somewhere. In the meantime, he said, there isn't much we can do as Stewart is 
in Italy and is virtually impossible to reach. 

If I find anything else out I'll let you know.

Thanks,
Kate

Stewart called last Friday and said there would be some deals for the City of 
Roseville to be confirmed.  He did not have deal numbers for these deals, and 
so far, I have not seen any deals for this counterparty.  Do you know 
anything about these deals?  Can check around and see if anyone else knows 
about them?

Thanks!
