I wanted to check with you on this. All these deals are entered in your book, 
and I know the Services desk typically does their own confirmations with 
counterparties. However, these deals have comments in them that say they 
replace other deals. In that case, would you like them confirmed by Houston? 
Let me know.

Thanks,
Kate

They all had some sort of replacement comment so I just wanted to double 
check to see if we should confirm.

Thanks!!
