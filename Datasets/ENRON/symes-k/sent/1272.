I've changed both of these. Thanks a lot for the info - you know, I went 
through all of this before, even to the point of looking up the contract with 
Christian Yoder - but the traders need it beaten into their heads! I'll 
remind them, and we'll see what happens......

593969 and 593970

These two deals are in as the wrong counterparty.  I am asking Rhonda to 
inactivate this name so he won't keep using it.  I think it is a real long, 
involved name starting with "the" rather than city of Oakland.  Go figure how 
someone alphabetizes!  Can you check into this.

Thanks!
