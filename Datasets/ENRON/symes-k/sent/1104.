I've changed both deals to FPL Energy Power Marketing. Tom said the guy who 
calls him from this counterparty each day says he's from Florida Power & 
Light - so he's going to ask him next time which counterparty he'd like us to 
specify in the deal. Also, I changed 570450 to a price of $80.

Thanks,
Kate

Kate, This is a Tom Alonso trade. For these two trades they are entered as 
Florida Power & Light. FPL Energy Power Marketing sent a confirmation over on 
this trade. Could you ask Tom if he entered the trade incorrectly for both 
deal numbers. Secondly on #570450 the confirmation shows a price of $80. We 
have $85.00 in the system. Which one is correct?

Thanks,

Kimberly
