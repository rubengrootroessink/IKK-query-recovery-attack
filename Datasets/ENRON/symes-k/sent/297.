I've heard some mumbling about problems with EES deals, so this doesn't come 
as much of a surprise. Here's what I've done:

On the first deal, #481619, I'd feel more comfortable if Mike Swerzbin, the 
trader who did the deal, gave his okay to change the price. I've left a 
message with him to verify the price, and at the very latest I'll see him 
tomorrow morning.

Deal #480433 cannot be killed because it contains liquidated strips; however, 
it looks like Phil Platter, the Short Term California scheduler, has alreday 
zeroed out the deal. Will this work? Or is there another method by which I 
can go about killing a deal? (Sorry to ask so many questions, but 90% of our 
office is already gone for the holidays and quite difficult to get ahold of.)

I've changed #481620. I think the trader just overcompensated for the change 
back from Daylight Savings Time. I'll remind these guys to always enter PPT 
for the time zone, to be on the safe side.

I hope this solves at least some of the problems for now. I'll let you know 
as soon as I talk to Swerzbin tomorrow. Let me know if there's anything else.

Kate

Subject: problems!

Happy Holidays!

We have a few problems with deals with EES.  We have tried to get them 
straightened out here, but I think it has come to the traders duking it out.  
Our contact at EES, Judy Dyer has checked these deals with her traders and 
they won't come around to our way of thinking on these deals.

Deal #481619 should be $145.00 even.  The trader says the deal was done 
direct and they are not paying the 5 cent charge

Deal # 480433 should be killed.

Deal # 481620 is not input correctly.  This is another one where the hours 
have been duplicated.  The first strip and the last strip repeat 10/29 for 
the same hours.  This makes the total Mws on the deal doubled by the amount 
that flows that day which is 400.

Thanks and you have a Merry Christmas, ya' hear!
