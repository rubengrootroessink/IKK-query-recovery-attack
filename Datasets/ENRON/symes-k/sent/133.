I've checked with Matt Motley and changed 458712 and 458718 to reflect broker 
fees of .0075.

I've left a message for Mike Swerzbin to double-check. He has 457489 entered 
in his log book with no broker fee, but 459812 says nothing either way; so 
I'd like to get ahold of him before I change anything.

Thanks,
Kate
