I've changed 469388 to include a broker fee - trader mistake. Mike Driscoll 
and Swerzbin swear that the other two should not include broker fees. 
Driscoll just checked with the Natsource broker, who cleared this up with his 
back office - so they should agree now. Let me know if there is still a 
discrepancy. I believe the Natsource broker is changing this.

Thanks,
kate
