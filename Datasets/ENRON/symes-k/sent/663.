Thanks, Neil. They're on the mailing list now. And yes, it's hard to believe 
there are not one but TWO William Williams in our office.

I'm sorry - I have no idea who Christer is - I'm assuming Chris Foster? Also, 
we have two Bill Williams - I assume you mean the real time manager, Bill 
Williams III. Let me know if I'm right, and I'll be happy to add them to the 
mailing list.

Thanks,
Kate
