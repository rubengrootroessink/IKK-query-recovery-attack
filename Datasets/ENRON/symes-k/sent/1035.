Mark -
I'm sending you two things that I hope will clarify some of these 
discrepancies. The first is an updated Real Time spreadsheet for 3/19 that 
shows the volumes for deal 553219. Bill Williams and I looked over their 
spreadsheets and could not find this deal in the 3/16 sheet - so I'm still 
wondering why EES thinks this deal should be in at a different date and 
price. 

The second document is a modified version of the sheet you sent me. In it, I 
answered the questions I could and changed things I knew were wrong. I also 
asked questions on deals where I can't find a discrepancy between my sheet 
and EnPower. 

Please keep in contact on this issue - I know this is only a start.

Subject: March EES Differences

I will be out of the office on Friday, attached is the spreadsheet of the 
differences noted so far between EES & EPMI and where we are with them.  
Since the GL needs to be booked by the end of the day Wednesday I am sending 
this file to everyone.  Please take a look and let me know if more 
information is needed.

Kate you asked about deal #553219.1 EES shows this deal on the 16th at a 
price of $125.  They do not see this deal on their real time sheets for the 
19th. 

 

Thanks,

Mark
