This is the last e-mail I received from Laura. Looks like she forgot the 
attachment the first time.

Sorry Nancy. I sent this too quickly and left off the attachment the first 
time. 

Regards,
Laura

Nancy,

I have attached a draft Confidentiality Agreement for your review. If it is 
acceptable, please sign and fax a copy to me at 503-464-3740. We should be 
able to begin work with a faxed document in place.  

As we discussed, we need to analyze two sources of water for the project; 
city water and the port's well water. Please overnight the containers for 
collection of the water to me at: 

Enron North America
121 SW Salmon, 3WTC 0306
Portland, OR 97204
(Tel.: 503-464-3830)

Ed Clark and I will collect the water samples Friday morning and overnight 
them to you (Saturday delivery) to make sure that they are there first thing 
Monday morning. 

I was able to find a Well and Water Right Evaluation that was performed by 
Robinson and Noble, Inc. If you could send your fax number to me and to Kate 
Symes (ksymes@enron.com), we will fax you a copy for your review. I will also 
work on getting you a conceptual design of the project for analysis of the 
waste water flow.

Thank you in advance for your assistance and speedy response. I realize that 
we are targeting an aggressive date (the morning of October 23) for the work 
to be completed. 

Sincerely,
Laura Wente
503-464-3830
