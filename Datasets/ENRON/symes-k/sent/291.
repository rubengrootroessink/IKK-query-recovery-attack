I've forwarded this e-mail to Christian and Greg. Unfortunately, the 
population of the office is quickly dwindling as the holidays come near. I've 
been told that one or the other of them will be in today, and I'll find out 
if something has been sent out already, and if not, how soon we can do that. 
I'll get back to you as soon as I talk to them.

Thanks,
Kate

Hi Kate,
Deals #478168, 478944, 478945, 478946 are to be confirmed by either Greg 
Wolfe or Christian Yoder.  We need to get the final copy of these confirm 
letters so we can scan them into the system for our files.  Also, if the 
finalized confirm has been sent to the counterparty we need to change the 
status in the system.  These deals are still showing up on our "New" report 
every morning and I need to do something with them.
Thanks for your help!
Kim
