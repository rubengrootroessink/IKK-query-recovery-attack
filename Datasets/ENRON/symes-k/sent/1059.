This was a futures contract done by Matt Motley, and I entered the forward 
deal. I wasn't aware that futures deals don't get confirmed. I only knew that 
when the contract expires, I need to enter a forward deal in EnPower to hold 
the trader's position. It looks like you've already added a comment about the 
trade going physical off of the NYMEX. Is there anything else you'd like me 
to add? If not, I'll just make a note in the comments section of forward 
deals entered in place of expiring futures contracts, and I'll mark "no 
confirm" on these deals as well.

Thanks,
Kate

Hello, 563928 is a deal that went physical off of the NYMEX.  I am not sure 
who entered the trade but if we could get you all to put a comment saying the 
trade went physical off of the NYMEX that would help us alot.  We do not 
confirm these trades.  We sent a confirm out to the counterparty for this 
trade and referenced the incorrect contract.

Thanks for your help,
Melissa
