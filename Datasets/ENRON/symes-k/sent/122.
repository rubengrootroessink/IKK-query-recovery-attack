I'm so stoked you're going to Buena Vista Social Club. I can't believe you 
are such a rotten "bik" that you didn't invite me. What's up with that?

My advice on the Outward Bound thing is to hold off. Not for selfish, 
wine-swilling reasons, of course; but because I know how tiring it gets to be 
living out of a suitcase with no dinero for a period of time. I have to say 
that sticking around Portland for the last six months has given me a renewed 
sense of mental health. Granted, I'm not totally sane yet, but at least I can 
imagine what it would be like. If you came home and turned right around and 
went to Colorado, you'd feel unprepared and maybe a little overwhelmed. Think 
carefully about how much Outward Bound would pay you in comparison with how 
much money you actually need to get by. Then add $500/month to that figure, 
and you'll be about right. It always sounds easier than the reality - I'm 
only speaking from Maui experience here. 

If you want to do a whirlwind Denver thing and have a great, rustic, totally 
broke time, then totally go for it. But if you feel like you're getting to 
the end of your rope with scraping by and feeling unsettled - which it kind 
of sounds like you are - then hang in P-town for awhile. Like I said, I'd 
feel SOOOO much better about taking off on my next adventure NOW than I would 
have even a couple months ago. And it's only been six months since I got back 
- that's not really too long to wait. In the meantime, you don't have to live 
with mom. The Malachowsky's room will be open, although for all the help I've 
given them I wouldn't be surprised if they don't want a Symes there anymore. 
Then there's always my future apartment. I'm thinkin' downtown for sure.

Anyway, we'll talk more about it in Mexico. Don't stress - whatever you're 
meant to do, you'll end up doing whether you like it or not.

Love,
Kate
