Chris -
Looks like these deals might have been entered for the wrong term. I'll check 
with Jeff on this, but if you recognize that the terms are wrong, please let 
me know and I can fix them. Here are the deals:

On Peak
15 MW @ $260

576275

Thanks for checking on this.
Kate

Kate, 
I called Alicia Izarraraz from Atlantic to verbal trades and she was 
inquiring about the term of trade, May delivery, she thought they were going 
to be for April delivery. Deals 576274.01, 576275.01.  Kate, can you ask 
Chris to call regarding inquiry.  Her cell phone is 949-637-4878, her desk 
number 562-499-3201 she said she will be out if the office soon.  No broker, 
done direct.
Thanks
Sp
