This sequence of e-mails is a little confusing, so I highlighted the parts 
you probably want to focus on in red. Like I said, I've been staring at these 
deals for too many hours now to see clearly what went wrong. As far as I can 
tell, either APB or Jeff Richter was checking out wrong. Now I just want to 
get to the bottom of it! Aaaaaaaa!

I just want to clarify something, because we were here until about 9 p.m. 
last night trying to flatten our position, and just figured out this morning 
that we were off due to the Williams deal that I changed yesterday evening. 
Apparently Jeff Richter didn't do any deals with Williams for 50 MW through 
APB, but he did do one for 50 MW with Prebon. So I'm wondering why APB was 
checking out like this? If possible, I'd like to avoid this in the future. 
Let me know if you can find anything out from APB.

Thanks,
Kate
