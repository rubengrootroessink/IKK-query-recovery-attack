its okay, its not a big deal, i just wanted you to change it instead of me, 
just to be sure.  i am always usually in such a hurry when i talk to you.  
but, since it has slowed down a bit......i wanted to let you know you are 
doing a wonderful job, and you really are a pleasure to work with.  again i 
am sorry if it seems like i am always in a rush, just tell me to chill out.  
but, thanks for being so great.  i will pass that on to the traders when i 
get a chance!

I just added it. I don't know why, but I checked Jeff's Deal Blotter and he 
had entered the broker. For some reason this did not transfer over into Deal 
Entry. Sorry!

First deal is 481433. Jeff Richter entered this awhile ago.

Second deal is 481489. Sean Crandall forgot to put the broker in - he's 
adding that right now.

Thanks,
Kate
