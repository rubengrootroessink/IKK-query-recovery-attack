Our fax number is 503-464-3740. You can send those deal numbers over whenever 
you get a chance, and I'll look them over and talk to the appropriate traders 
and IT. Thanks so much for your diligence during this transition. I'll keep 
you informed on the IT effort.

Thanks,
Kate

Subject: "no confirm" deals

Hi Kate!
I am beginning to see a familiar pattern beginning in the West (-familiar 
because it's the same problem we have with East traders).  There are A LOT of 
deals that need to be changed to "no confirm."  I'd like to fax a list of 
them to you so that you can 1st, change their status in Deal Entry to "not to 
be confirmed" and 2nd, bug the traders who enter the deals to remember to 
enter them correctly.  Also, you mentioned working with Will Smith in IT to 
get these deals to automatically be "no confirm" when the traders enter 
them.  You may want to use some of these as examples so to help IT figure the 
logic behind which deals are confirmed and which aren't.  Please let me know 
your fax number so that i can send you this report.  
Thanks!
