These deals were entered as flowing all days, and should have just been Mon - 
Sat. This was my fault, as I didn't know my computer defaulted to all days. 
(This has since been fixed!) I've changed them in the system and was told to 
let you know so you can re-confirm the deals with just on-peak days. Sorry 
about the hassle. I promise I'll get the hang of this soon!

Thanks,
Kate
