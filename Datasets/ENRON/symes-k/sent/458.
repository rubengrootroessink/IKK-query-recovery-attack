A Real Time guy mistakenly sold to Coral instead of using their established 
PGE transmission deal. 505750 has been killed and the transmission has been 
re-scheduled under deal #146517.

Please check this deal.  It is booked under Coral for transmission.  We don't 
have a transmission contract with Coral and we don't usually sell 
transmission.  Let me know.
