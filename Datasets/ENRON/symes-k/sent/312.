This deal is part of a sleeve - we bought Powerex at 145.00 and sold EES at 
145.05. This is standard procedure for these kinds of deals, said the guys at 
the Long Term Northwest desk. They're positive that the deal should include a 
5-cent charge on the sale side; and Mike Driscoll said if EES still disputes 
this, they can call him to verify.

Please let me know if this deal continues to be a problem.

Thanks,
Kate

Thanks!
The holidays for me were really nice.  All my brothers were home so they kept 
me pretty busy.  But it doesn't sound like it compares with yours!  Happy New 
Year!
On another, not so exciting, note, I have another question about the EESI 
deal #481619.  I just spoke with Judy and they say that the price is supposed 
to be $145.00 not $145.05.  Can you check on that one?  It's the only one 
still hanging out there from the mess before the holidays.

Oops - I guess the deal can't be killed because it contains liquidated 
strips. I've changed the confirm status to no confirm, and the energy to 
CAISO - so even though the deal has no volume or price, its other details are 
correct.

Hi Kate,
This deal needs to be changed to no confirm (it's a West daily deal).  Also, 
it has an NP-15 delivery point with firm energy.
Thanks!
Kim
