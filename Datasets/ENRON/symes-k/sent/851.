Dearest Anna, my most favorite sister of them all!

I'm sorry I've been so bad about staying in touch while you've been stuck in 
those Rocky Mountain highs and lows of life. It sounds like things are going 
really well though (Rocky Mountain "highs") and that you've made it through 
most of the tumult of moving to a new place (Rocky Mountain "lows"). Amber 
tells me every time she talks to Marky, her man of the hour, he mentions how 
they've got to get together with you when she comes to town - which will be 
on next Friday, whoo hoo, party! I'm so mad that she gets to go and I don't, 
being that I am not, like her, in my eighth year of college and therefore do 
not enjoy such things as "Spring Break Mania" anymore. And Monica tells Marky 
who tells Amber who tells me that she'd love to hang out with you more often. 
It sounds like you guys had a ball at dinner, eh? So you've got options, 
girlfriend, which is worlds more than I can say for my life at the mo'. It 
pretty much consists of working, eating, and sleeping. I'm definitely looking 
into that SAD mental disorder thing, because I think it's got me in its 
clutches. But the recent abundance of sunshine has brought me enough renewed 
energy to start thinking about life after winter. We're doing lots of 
gardening, cooking, and decorating at the house - it's like having three 
Martha Stewarts all working together, only slightly less stylish , immensely 
less efficient, and drunk. Other than that, I've been trying to organize and 
simplify my life - taking care of mounds of paperwork, paying off debts, 
sorting out all those nagging little post-it notes that plague me constantly 
and demand my attention in vain. I'm actually starting to see the light at 
the end of the tunnel, like maybe I could buy a car or take a trip in a few 
months, or even buy a SECOND pair of shoes, but let's not get wild and crazy 
just yet. So I heard Dad and Laura are on their way to your neck of the woods 
with an automobile. That is, in the immortal words of the guys in "Dude, 
where's my car?", SWEET... DUDE! You are stoked. I bet that's a major load 
off - just make sure to keep your finances in check and not get in over your 
head. Take it from one who knows. I'm seriously looking into buying an old 
beater car; but then I start fantasizing about the Audi A4 Quattro, and 
suddenly $30,000 doesn't seem like a bad price for becoming ultimately cool. 
Lately I've been doing a lot of research into self-improvement measures. I 
just applied for post-baccalaureate status at U of O, so I can start taking 
economics and poli sci classes online. (I just got my new FREE computer from 
work!) I'm also studying for the GRE, and pretty soon here I'm going to get 
serious about graduate school. I think I've decided on international studies 
and/or economics, depending on how well I like the classes I take. I've found 
my dream program at Johns Hopkins University in Washington, D.C. It's a 
two-year Masters of International Studies program that begins in Washington 
and ends in.....are you sitting down?.....Bologna, Italy! Holy shit, does it 
get more perfect? Apparently it's like the premiere training ground for 
government officials, according to my friend Andy who laughed forcefully in 
my face when I told him I wanted to get into it. But I figure, I'm not 
getting any younger, and I don't want any regrets, so I'm goin' for it, dude. 
As for the love life, it's nonexistant, which is why I'm putting so much 
energy into the self-improvement area of my life. I figure as long as I'm 
having no fun with boys I might as well be beefing up my net value. By the 
time they come around again, the eligible pool will have shrunk to 1 in 100 
million. Whatever. Anyway, now that I've written you the longest paragraph of 
my life, I must retreat to my work duties. Then it's off for a thrilling tour 
of Portland via Tri-Met. Molly's making me dinner tonight in exchange for a 
finished resume. It's only taken her 3 years to compile the information for 
it, so this one should be a doozy. Hey, if you can ever make it home for a 
weekend, you should come at the end of May - David Gray is coming to the 
Schnitzer, and it's going to be fabulous! I'll buy your concert ticket if you 
can convince Dad to get your plane ticket. Call me soon if you can, or I'll 
call this weekend. Take care and I miss you!

Love,
Kate

Hey Lady!

What do you think you're doing?  I haven't talked to you in way too long.
You have to update me on the sitch!  I am going on a date with a guy I met
while out with Monica last weekend.  He was our waiter and he looks like
Chandler Bing, only Monica kept calling him Chanandler Bong (did you see
that episode when they had to name who the TV Guide came to?).  She is so
fun!  I was so glad to get out of my apartment/away from my roommate.  And
now I have a date, so I'm excited.  I'm still in contact with Mr.
Colorblind, but we've had the friends talk so it's been really cool.  In
fact, he's nicer to me now than he was before!  Anyway, that's crazy news
about Mom's house!  I guess no more crashing at her house when I go home.
How are your roommates?  Your seattle boyfriend?  Your job?  Write me with
the goods, woman.  I am getting a car in two weeks and I am more excited
than any car-buyer has ever been.  My job is great, although i think I'm
getting scoliosis from bad posture in an uncomfortable chair all day.
Nothing else is happening.  Are you going out for St. Patrick's Day?  I have
to work, but there's a big outdoor thing downtown that I might go to
afterwards.  Okay, must go work.  Call me though!  I miss you!

Love, Anna
