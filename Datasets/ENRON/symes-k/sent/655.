I create a report each afternoon that tracks total volume done by each desk 
through EOL and brokered deals. I've attached last night's report for you to 
look over - if this looks like something you'd like to receive, let me know 
and I'll add you to the mailing list. 

And in regard to the dow jones file, I've just finished entering deals for 
Friday and Saturday, so my afternoon will be devoted to creating that. I'll 
let you know as soon as it's done.



Thanks,
Kate

I am running a sales volume report, and am looking for a number to compare it 
to.
