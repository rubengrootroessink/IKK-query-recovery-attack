I'm sorry it's taken me so long to track down this name and number, but I 
finally spoke with someone at Puget who said Suzanne McFadden is the person 
you need to talk to. Her number is 425-462-3844. 

If you need any other information, please don't hesitate to ask.

Thanks,

Can you please get a contact name and phone number for this counterparty from 
Mike Swerzbin as soon as possible? -I need to get a verbal confirm on this 
deal so that we can send out the confirmation letter and the number we have 
in the system has been disconnected.  Also, we're checking on that other deal 
that I asked you about yesterday (I thought we confirmed it under the 
original deal # so I wasn't sure if we needed to confirm it again)
Thanks!
Kim
