DUDE! You're too good to be true. Between you and my roommates, the emanation 
of love germs is almost too much to handle. Hey, if you get this in the next 
half an hour, write back with your phone number and I'll call you when I get 
off work. (I'm leaving at 5 p.m. ON THE DOT today....whooo, hooo!) But this 
newfound life perfection sounds like it deserves a phone conversation.

Kate

Hey lady!

What's up?  I just had the most hectic week of my life!  I had such a great
time with Dad and Laura - is it just me or does he get cooler every time you
see him?  He took me, Nathan, Michelle and Monica out to this awesome
restaurant and totally paid for everyone.  I was so touched, especially
since I think they're kind of trying to watch the funds.  My car is great!
It's so little and perfect.  Then as soon as they left I went on my Outward
Bound weekend, which was incredible.  We went snowshoeing, did a ropes
course, and learned how to use a map and compass (the last thing was SO fun
- I want to buy a compass and carry it around with me everyday).  Anyway,
I'll have to tell you more about it on the phone since it was kind of
complicated, but super fun.  I had SUCH a great time, and I'm even more
convinced that this is the right job for me right now.  Nathan is still good
- I'm installing a toothbrush at his apartment, which I think is a good
sign.  He's great.

So what's going on in your life?  Call me tonight if you get a chance!

Love, yo sista
