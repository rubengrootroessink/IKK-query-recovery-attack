I've spoken with Tim Cannon at Sempra, who said that what he needed was for 
our broker and his broker to talk to each other and agree that this deal has 
gone physical and is no longer on NYMEX. Then I talked to Matt Motley, who 
talked to his broker, who will now talk to Sempra's broker and hopefully 
solve this once and for all.

You're right though. There's no need for it to be this difficult, especially 
when we do it every month. I think it would be really helpful if we could get 
a hold of Dave Dupre to find out how this was handled before. If we can't, I 
guess we'll just have to determine who will take responsibility for making 
sure these deals are recognized as physical by both parties. I would be happy 
to do that each month when we exercise our futures options, but I want 
everyone involved to be aware of the procedure.

Thanks a lot for helping on this. Please let me know if you find out anymore.

Thanks,
Kate

Hello, I left a message for David Dupre and he has not called me back.  If 
you want to have Matt call Tim Cannon at Sempra that would be fine.  His 
phone number is (203) 355-5190.  I don't know why this has been so 
difficult.  If I hear from David I will let you know.  I want to know how he 
handled these deals in the past.

Thanks,
Melissa

Just curious - did you ever catch up with Larry Joe Hunter regarding the Long 
Term Southwest desk's futures deal with Sempra? I'm wondering if I should 
grab Matt Motley before he goes home today to let him know he needs to get a 
hold of Tim Cannon about the ADT. Let me know when and if you talk to him.

Thanks,
Kate
