I just heard back from Jeff on these deals - apparently he's hiding his trade 
log now to keep his secrets safe! Well that didn't work too well for us 
today, because the two missing deals were right there at the bottom....with 
no deal numbers! Anyway, Jeff said he'd enter these in the morning, and if 
you hear anything from Prebon in the meantime, these are good deals.

Thanks,
Kate
