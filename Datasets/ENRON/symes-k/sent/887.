Two things: First. What does the art of motorcycle riding have to do with 
lost literature or George Eliot? Second. Elliot is spelled Eliot. But 
otherwise, thoroughly enjoyable e-mail message, if not a tad smug over the 
whole book-finding issue. Where did you find it, anyway? E-bay? Afghanistan? 
You know, in some circles they would consider procurement of that book akin 
to scoring a pound of pure cocaine. Not that yucky not adulterated stuff. I'm 
rambling and should actually go do some work, being that that is the 
technical term for what I'm doing right now. "Working," that is. But I have 
several spreadsheets strategically placed around my computer screens (I have 
two, that's how important I am), to make it appear that I'm VERY, VERY busy. 
And speaking of importance, I'm curious to know if you're the actual "owner" 
of the Portland Running Co., as it states on your card, or if the Portland 
Running Co. is one of those forward-thinking organizations that gives all its 
employees pseudo-ownership in the form of one stock share, or if those are 
just cards you had made to impress people? In any case, I probably owe you 
some retroactive respect for your ingenuity, either for becoming the owner of 
such a shop, or for making people believe you are. Hey, do you know what 
George Eliot's real first name is? If you respond to this e-mail in the next 
twenty minutes, I'll tell you. Otherwise you're on your own. By the way, 
that's a beautifully worded passage you chose. And it rhymes, in case you 
didn't notice that.

Kate

"Was never true love loved in vain,
For truest love is highest gain.
No art can make it:  it must spring
Where elements are fostering.
So in heaven's spot and hour
Springs the little native flower,
Downward root and upward eye,
Shapen by the earth and sky."

Prologue to chapter 47, "The Dead Hand"
Middlemarch,  George Elliot, 1871
