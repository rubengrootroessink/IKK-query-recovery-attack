Joaner Boner -
Well, in my usual slacker fashion, I haven't bought my plane ticket yet - so 
I totally think you should go to Sunriver. I might come visit you there if 
there's room. But an S.F. visit is imminent, I swear. I'll call you soon to 
discuss the alcoholism of your co-worker/boyfriend, as well as the techniques 
for acquiring this sexy body for the new year. Work is consuming my life and 
eating me whole - very chaotic what with hiding all the power from you guys 
and whatnot. Imagine the pressure. Another reason it might not be the best 
time for me to come is that I'm moving on Friday. Amber and Molly and I found 
a big, beautiful house in NE, near Grant High - it's kickass. But it's sucked 
away all of my money and will probably take over every free moment for the 
next month just to get it set up. If you want, you should stop by for a sleep 
over on your way to Bend. We'll throw a party. And what's up with the wrist 
disease? Are you not taking your calcium or something? I'm convinced that 
these wacky desk jobs are aging us youthful beauties prematurely. At least 
that's the excuse I like to give when I come in to work looking like I just 
bathed in a life-sized ashtray. Call me soon - I'm really curious to find out 
why Brooks is doing the chicken dance EVER let alone in your room in the 
middle of the night. Wheeew!

Happy Sexy Body New Year,
Kate

Subject: Sexy Body for the New Year!!!


Hey Kate -
My subject line is a duplicate of an email I received this morning from some
beauty .com site.  Steve Cross puts me on all of these stupid mailing lists,
so I thought I'd be retarded and put that in my subject line because it's a
stupid subject!

Anyway, how are you doing these days?  I wanted to write and see if you
really got your ticket to come visit over President's Day weekend!  I
totally want you to come down!!!  I'd be so excited.  If you don't, though,
I think I'm going to look into going up to Bend for the weekend to chill in
SunRiver and snowboard a little!  Maybe you could meet me there and stay w/
me at my parents house?  Ash is going up for sure.  If you're coming down
here, that's GREAT!  I'd be SOOO excited.

I'm on complete crack today, if you can't tell.  I have carpal tunnell, too.
Last night I woke up at 2am to Brooks coming home from a drunken night out
and he started doing the chicken dance in my room and almost knocked over my
entire shelf, tv, etc.  Then he started babbling about nothing, passed
straight out and started totally snoring.  So I didn't get back to sleep
until like 4:30 and had to wake up at 6.  I was livid this morning.  I'm
such a bitch, but I need my sleep!  Dammit.

Anyway, write soon!   I miss you!
joan
