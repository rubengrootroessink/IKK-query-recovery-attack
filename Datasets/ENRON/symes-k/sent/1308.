Here's the latest -
The Short Term West Services desk bought power from Sierra Pacific Holding 
Co. for 4/29 and 4/30. Then, Bob Ellery, our contact there, called the Real 
Time desk and said they had lost a unit and needed to buy some of the power 
back from us. The deals are in our system as follows:

594854
EPMI buys Sierra Pac.
NP-15
4/29 - 45 mw round-the-clock
4/30 - 40 mw round-the-clock
$218 off peak
$328 on peak

595714
Short Term West Hourly sells Automated Power Exchange (Sierra's scheduling 
coordinator)
NP-15
4/29 - 19 mw round-the-clock
$228
(Total Value = $103,968)

Because Sierra's buy-back was in the Real Time market, we sold to their SC, 
not Sierra itself. Also, confirm letters don't go out on hour-ahead trades, 
which could be why you're running into some confusion. Let me know if this 
helps, and I'll continue to look for a deal flowing on 4/30. The Real Time 
group told me there was one, but it's only for the first 6 hours, not the 
whole day. 

I'll get back to you soon.

Kate, what is the latest regarding Sierra Pacific Industries and the buy 
backs for the 29th & 30th in the amount of $103,968 for each day?  Let me 
know if I can obtain more information for you.  The payment terms are net 5 
days after receipt of invoice, which they faxed to me on April 30th.

Again, thanks for all your help regarding this and all the EES items.
