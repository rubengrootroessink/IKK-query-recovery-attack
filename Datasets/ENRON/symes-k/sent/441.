Here's what I threw together this afternoon. Let me know if there are any 
other people in particular you'd like added to the list. Also let me know if 
you try any of these extensions and they happen to be wrong (we have a hard 
time keeping up with changing numbers too!). Forward this on to anyone you 
feel it might be useful to; but please let them know to call me first and 
foremost, since I'll probably be the most receptive on the phone. 

Hope you had a safe trip back home. Again, it was great to meet you and Kim.

Talk to you soon,
Kate
