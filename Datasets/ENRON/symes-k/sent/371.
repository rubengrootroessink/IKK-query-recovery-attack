It looks great, Nadine. I entered a couple different deals and played around 
with them a bit, and I don't see any changes. So from my end you can go ahead 
and move this version to production.

Thanks for all the hard work.

Kate

Subject: Deal Entry:  New Version


Hi Everyone,

There is a new version of Deal Entry (Ver. 2.6.6.58)  in stage that needs to 
be User Acceptance Tested.

The changes were actually for Australia (wrong date/time showing, problem 
with EOL) and London (fix to default settings).
These changes should actually be invisible to Houston so you should see no 
difference between the way it was working before and now.

Please test the application (as you would normally use it) and let me know 
(by way of email or phone call) if Deal Entry is working well, and can be 
migrated to Production.  We are hoping to release it to Prod by this evening, 
(January 12, 2001).


Thanks, 
Nadine Costanzo (713)853-9863.
