Anyone care to appeal the decision?  I know some people get reimbursed, for 
example, for a racquet club membership, which is not technically a gym.  
Also, I think a yoga center qualifies as a health facility.  I don't want to 
cause a "stink", but I think this deserves discussion.  
But maybe we're back at square one:  trying to get something organized at the 
Fit Factory.

Anna -

The fitness reimbursement is for gym/health facility memberships only.  If 
the yoga classes are part of a fitness club, they certainly can be included 
in the reimbursement up to $25.00.

Please let me know if you have any other questions.
Amy

Subject: Fitness Reimbursement Question

Hi Amy,

I am interested in taking yoga classes, and typically the yoga centers do not 
charge an annual sign on fee.  There are, of course monthly fees or fees by 
the class.  Will I still be able to get reimbursed $25 / month (but still not 
qualify for the $100 annual fee reimbursement)?  

Please let me know, as there are others also interested in yoga class 
reimbursement schedules.

Thanks,
Anna
