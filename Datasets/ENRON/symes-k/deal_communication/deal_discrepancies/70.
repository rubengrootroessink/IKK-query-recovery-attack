Winston, can you please delete the 3 in there, it's for 11/19/00 & 11/20/00

Kate, until Winston deletes these deals, they'll have to be manually input.

Thanks,

Carla

Winston and Kate,

the Cal imbalance deals won't upload to Enpower.  I had some trouble on 
Saturday so I had saved the CAl Imbalance deal to the table and 

now, it won't upload any of the imbalance deals, .  

Carla
