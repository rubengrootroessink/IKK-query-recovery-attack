We are researching this deal and need your help.

Could you take a look at this deal?  I've pulled the audit viewer and the 
deal tickets.  My real question is - what deal do we actually have 
confirmed?  Leg 3 was the deal we carried on our books that had the expiry in 
March.  Since Modesto did not exercise, we realized a rather small fortune 
and want to make sure it was a real deal.  

I think we do not want to contact our counterparty but we do want to pull the 
deal records for confirm.  Can you help?
