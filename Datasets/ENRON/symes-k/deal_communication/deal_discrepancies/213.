You're on the job girl!  I just got your email.  Don't worry about all the 
errors, if they didn't make mistakes, we wouldn't have a job, and it's no 
worse now than it's ever been.  But you are very responsive and fun to work 
with -that makes all the difference!  Just a little positivity (can't have 
too much of that!)

I just changed both of these deals to CAISO energy, instead of Firm. I 
noticed that the one you asked about, #481620, was part of an EES sleeve, so 
I checked the other side of it, deal #481621, and sure enough it also had the 
incorrect energy type. It's holiday fever!

Thanks,
Kate
