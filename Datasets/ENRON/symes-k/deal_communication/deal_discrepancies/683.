Tom's in a meeting, but in his trade log he has APS crossed out and over it 
he's written Pinnacle. So I'm going to wait to find out what happened. I'll 
let you know.

Tom Alonso
deal 555159
Bloomberg shows cp as Arizona Public Service....we have Pinnacle West.


From my understanding from Rhonda trades can still be done under APS or 
Pinncale West.  Please tell him to clarify which cp with the broker as the 
trade is being done.

Thanks!!
