I show now two Smurfit Deals,

403522 for 25 flat, at 54.65,    and 246859.1 for 15  hlh, AND 25 hlh,   and 
246859 for 15 llh AND 25 llh.

I have zeroed out the 25's from 246859 in Scheduling, and we are flat now.  I 
did not change it in the deal because we were calcing, and I want to check 
with Diana first before doing it.

What I show in Scheduling is a sale to Smurfit for 40 mw flat, which is what 
is actually scheduled
