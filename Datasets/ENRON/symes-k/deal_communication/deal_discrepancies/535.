When you change this to no confirm, please put a note in the comment section 
about why we are not domfirming it, because it falls within our guidelines to 
confirm and at somepoint, I will be asked why we did not confirm this deal.

Thanks!

Deal should be no confirm. It was done by Stan Cocke in Services, and those 
guys deal directly with their counterparty contacts. He thought he marked 
this no confirm, but must have defaulted to confirm anyway. I'll change deal 
as soon as risk is done with their calc.
