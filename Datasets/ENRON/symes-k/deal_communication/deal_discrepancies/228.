HAPPY NEW YEAR!!! Hope you had a great holiday!
These EES deals were all changed by Carla so they're all in "Pending 
-Revised..." status in the system.  It looks like Carla made some changes, 
but then changed it back.  Can you please ask her if we need to send revised 
confirms on any of these deals.
