This should be changed to CAISO energy. Please let me know what you'd like me 
to do - change the deal or wait.

Thanks,
Kate

Subject: Deal #471740 Mieco

This deal is in "Pending - revised after sent to Ctrpty" status.  Some 
changes have been made to the deal, but it still has an SP-15 delivery point 
with Firm Energy.  Can you please find out whether it's the delivery pt. or 
the energy type that is wrong?
Thanks for your help!
Kim
