it is a certain guy that checks out at natsource, sometimes i wonder about 
him.  and the thing of it is, is that if they knew it wasn't ours, why didn't 
he call to tell me.  they don't care......thats just the way it goes with 
those brokers.  thanks again.

Thank you! I was so baffled for a minute there - when I said "April option" 
every trader just looked at me like I was crazy!

i just called the backoffice at natsource, the brokers weren't answering.  
and apparently it is not a good deal.  so don't worry about it.  thanks.

Natsource is going to have to give you a trader name on this because I've 
asked all of them and nobody recognizes it.
