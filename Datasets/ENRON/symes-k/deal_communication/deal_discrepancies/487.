Kate, called to verball non broker deal,
I didn't realize Diana and Valerie are working on this with Sharen here in 
the Houston office.  I gave him the expiry date of 6/29/01, he inquired why 
it was an expiry date, he thought it was exercised upon daily, just double 
checking..........just fyi

Thanks 
Stephanie
