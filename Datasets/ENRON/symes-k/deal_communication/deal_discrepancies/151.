Come to me first, and I can help you sort it out from there.  The only stuff 
that I have no clue about is the traders intra-book swaps.

Thank you! 

The itemization was absolutely no problem, and please let me know when I can 
do things like that to make your job go more smoothly. I know the market got 
chaotic late yesterday; so I probably could have assumed that our net 
position would be off today and at least one other person would know that. 
But it seems that in this business, assumption can cause a small problem to 
breed and multiply into one of mammoth proportions down the line. So I 
thought I'd ask. In the future, is it you I should come to, or real time?

Thanks again for your help.

Kate
