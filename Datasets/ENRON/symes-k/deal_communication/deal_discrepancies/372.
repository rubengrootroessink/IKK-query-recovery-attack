Thank you.  I think if I send these emails, they eventually pick the correct 
CP.  I hope you don't mind that I changed the deals myself.

Thank you for the reminder, Rhonda. I'm going to send out another 
announcement this afternoon to all our traders along with the daily 
correction log. Hopefully this will incite everyone to pay more attention to 
the counterparty names they choose.

Thanks again,
Kate
