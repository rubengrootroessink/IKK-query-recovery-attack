Kate,  

A request (below) has been made to fix a deal that was entered by Tom and 
Mark incorrectly (through the option exercise function in deal blotter).  The 
deal numbers and legs that need to be fixed are listed below.  Instead of 
being a forward transaction, these legs should be entered as index forwards.  
We are paying the DJ PV index plus $5 or 5%, whichever is more.  Therefore, 
if daily prices were more than $100 at palo verde, the offset should be 1.05.

I know that i have totally confused you but let me know of any questions you 
might have and I will be glad to help.

Thanks,

Kim

Caroline,

Deal #420886 legs 3-7 have no price attached to the deal.  Would you please
add the DJPV index plus an offset of 5%.  On legs 2 & 8 the offset needs to
be changed from $5.00 to 5%.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank You,
Katrina
