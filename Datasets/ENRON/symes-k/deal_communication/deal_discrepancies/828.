Kate, I am changing the forwards to the HOlding Company.  There are 2 
transmission deals with Sierra Pacific Industries that I think should be 
Buy/Resales.  We do not have transmission with either entity.  Can you check 
and see if the counterparty should be changed or they should be Buy/Resales?  
Thanks.
