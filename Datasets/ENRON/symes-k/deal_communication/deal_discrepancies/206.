Happy Holidays!

We have a few problems with deals with EES.  We have tried to get them 
straightened out here, but I think it has come to the traders duking it out.  
Our contact at EES, Judy Dyer has checked these deals with her traders and 
they won't come around to our way of thinking on these deals.

Deal #481619 should be $145.00 even.  The trader says the deal was done 
direct and they are not paying the 5 cent charge

Deal # 480433 should be killed.

Deal # 481620 is not input correctly.  This is another one where the hours 
have been duplicated.  The first strip and the last strip repeat 10/29 for 
the same hours.  This makes the total Mws on the deal doubled by the amount 
that flows that day which is 400.

Thanks and you have a Merry Christmas, ya' hear!
