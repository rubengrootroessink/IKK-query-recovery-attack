Dear Kate, 

Just a heads-up that I sent this to Bill,  so he may be asking you what the 
problems have been with EES.
Could I bring by the discrepancies a bit later?

Thanks,

Virginia

Dear Bill, 

Please read forward below.
I've seen a few problems with EES lately.  Last month, Kate Symes took care 
of the differences (she knows more about EES).  You may want to contact her 
to find out what has been happening lately to cause the differences.  Sorry - 
don't know much more.

Virginia

Virginia, please take a look at DMS #'s  7365 & 7367.  These are the start of 
the EES differences for March.  Both of these have to do with the ST-Whourly 
desk where we are lower by $5.00 then what EES has.  I spoke with Thresa and 
she suggested we have Bill Williams look at these in case their is a trend 
started for the month and we can catch it now.

Thanks,

Mark
