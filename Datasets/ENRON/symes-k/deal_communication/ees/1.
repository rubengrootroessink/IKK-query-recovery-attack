Kate,
I am in the confirmation group with EES and try to tie out our confirmtions 
with the EPMI list I receive from Kim Hundle (EPMI), on a weekly basis.  This 
file would be great help with this process.  Is there any way you could send 
this to me as well? This would help me determine who the problem is with.  I 
would appreciate it.  
Thanks 
Judy D
