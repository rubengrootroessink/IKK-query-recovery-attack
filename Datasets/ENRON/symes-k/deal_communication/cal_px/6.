Bob Badeer is handling the negotiations of the index changes, and he has 
assured me that all deals liquidating within this month have been updated.  
He is still working out the other deals.  If this is causing you any 
difficulty, please let me know.

Thanks,
Monica

Kate & Monica, do you know when these will be changed in Enpower to reflect 
the Dow Jones Index?

Thanks,

Kimberly Indelicato

Monica Lande also came up with a list of our outstanding deals with the PX. 
It contains most of the same deals that are found in your spreadsheet, and a 
few that aren't. Also, Bob Badeer has become the leader-by-default of this 
"project." Let me know if you'd like me to talk with him about our progress 
or have him call you. I'm not sure how involved you are, or how involved 
you'd like me to be, but I thought I'd keep you up to date on the happenings 
over here. Again, please let me know how I can help.

Thanks,
Kate
