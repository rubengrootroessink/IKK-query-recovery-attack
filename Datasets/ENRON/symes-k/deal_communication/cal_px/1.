I believe Melissa had talked to you about checking once again to see if these 
deals should be against the PX index.  It is our understanding that we are 
going to have to move everything that is against that index to another index 
at some point.

Thanks!

These deals were entered to flatten out the traders' positions in the PX. You 
shouldn't see the index being used on any deals past tomorrow (the exchange 
closes effective Feb. 1), but Bob Badeer and Matt Motley both had positions 
they needed to back out of. They turned around and bought the same amount at 
the Dow Jones index. Hope this helps!

Ditto.  These two are priced against the PX index also.

Thanks!

This deal lis entered against the PX index.  We have been told by Chris 
Foster that this index is going away.  Can you check and see if this is the 
correct index?

Thanks!
