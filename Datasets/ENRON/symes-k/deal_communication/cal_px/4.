Hey Ladies! Just wondering when these trades might be changed within Enpower?

Thanks,

Kimberly

Monica Lande also came up with a list of our outstanding deals with the PX. 
It contains most of the same deals that are found in your spreadsheet, and a 
few that aren't. Also, Bob Badeer has become the leader-by-default of this 
"project." Let me know if you'd like me to talk with him about our progress 
or have him call you. I'm not sure how involved you are, or how involved 
you'd like me to be, but I thought I'd keep you up to date on the happenings 
over here. Again, please let me know how I can help.

Thanks,
Kate
