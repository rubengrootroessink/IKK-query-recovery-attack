Kate, Melissa gave me the spreadsheet with all trades that need to be changed 
from Cal PX to Dow Jones SP/NP. After looking up the trades in Enpower these 
are the ones that have not been changed to reflect Dow Jones SP/NP. Could you 
please let me know when these might me changed? The ones in bold have been 
killed in Enpower.


Thanks,

Kimberly
