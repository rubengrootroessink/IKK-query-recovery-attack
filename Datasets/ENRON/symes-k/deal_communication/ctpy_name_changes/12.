I talked to Bill Williams and told him a quick (but not always perfect) way 
to see if it is the correct CP is to select the CP and then click on the Deal 
Clearing tab.  If there is a contract there or if you click on the arrow and 
a number is there, we have a K with that entity and it is the correct CP.  If 
it is blank under Global Contracts even after you click on the arrow, we do 
not have a contract with that entity and you have probably chosen the wrong 
CP.  I will also send him a list of entities we have Ks with, but he did not 
want them to have to look at a list.  Its probably a learning curve but at 
least this is a step in the right direction.  Let me know if you can think of 
other ways to help them.

Subject: Re: Incorrect Counterparties  

I've received some feedback from the Real Time group regarding these 
counterparty discrepancies. Apparently, they were never given notice of the 
correct counterparty names, and chose what seemed to be the most logical 
name. Can we come up with a system or master list of usable counterparty 
names for these guys to refer to when faced with an array of choices? (i.e. 
There are five different names under Transalta.) 

The concern lies with our daily correction report, which I generate and which 
includes all deals that have been changed and the name of the person who made 
the "error." This report can weigh unfairly against a trader who may be 
unaware of the difference between "Dynegy Marketing & Trade" and "Dynegy 
Power Marketing." I feel like there has to be a more efficient way to avoid 
these errors than publishing them in a report that gets sent throughout the 
company.

If you could help me compile this master list, or direct me to someone who 
can, I would greatly appreciate it. 

Thanks,
Kate
