EPMI just signed an EEI with the Port of Oakland - in addition we did a 
monthly deal for March.

The deal is as follows:
EPMI sell 7 MW of power flat at NP-15 for the month of March.  The price is 
$208.  The contact is Wing Lau (phone number is 510-627-1457).

I will be out on Wednesday and would like to review the contract on Thursday 
- scheduling will need to get it into the system 

Please call me on my cell phone with any questions (503-807-0920).

Thanks!

Stewart
