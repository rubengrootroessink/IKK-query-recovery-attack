593969 and 593970

These two deals are in as the wrong counterparty.  I am asking Rhonda to 
inactivate this name so he won't keep using it.  I think it is a real long, 
involved name starting with "the" rather than city of Oakland.  Go figure how 
someone alphabetizes!  Can you check into this.

Thanks!
