Hey! I'm so brain dead this morning I didn't even notice. But I'm sooooo glad 
you had a good experience. I just think he's the nicest guy, so I bombard him 
with people needing haircuts constantly. You know when I first went to him it 
was because I couldn't get in to see my regular lady and he was the only 
stylist who wasn't booked - now he never has a spare second! It makes me feel 
like a proud mother. Thanks for letting me know.

Kate
