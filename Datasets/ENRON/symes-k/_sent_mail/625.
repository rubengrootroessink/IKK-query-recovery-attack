The third deal - 531910 - I'm checking on with Les right now. Sharen Cason 
asked me this morning who the contact was, and typically with services deals 
the traders like to confirm the deals themselves - so I'm not sure if it 
should be confirmed.

The other two contain contact names - are they not valid in GCP? Do you need 
new names and phone numbers or just numbers to go along with those names?

Kate

Hi Kate!
I can't find any contact info. in GCP for these counterparties (California 
Dept. of Water Resources, Metro. Water Dist. of Southern Cal., and Atlantic 
Richfield Co.)  Can you give me contact names and phone numbers so that i can 
get a verbal confirm on these deals?
Thanks,
Kim H.
