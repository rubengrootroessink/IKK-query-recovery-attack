Just to let you all know - the following deals have been changed per Mike 
Swerzbin -

516611 - from H01 to Q3-01
516618 - from 10 mw to 16 mw
516651 - from Mid-C to Palo

Let me know if you have any questions about these changes. (Most were due to 
my inability to read his handwriting!)

Thanks,
Kate
