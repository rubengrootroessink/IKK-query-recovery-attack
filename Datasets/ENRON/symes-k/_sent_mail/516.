Testing was done in the test database; however, once they released the new 
version of deal entry into production, they tested one more time to make sure 
that the new fields were pulling into our scheduling reports. It was a 
precautionary measure taken so that we wouldn't enter deals all day long only 
to find out that they wouldn't show up in the Enpower to CAPS report at the 
end of the day. Sorry for the confusion.

Kate

Hi Kate, 

Can you please let Phil know that he should be testing deals in the enpower 
test database not the actual system.  

Thanks

This was just a practice deal entered by Phil yesterday to test our new 
version of deal entry. He zeroed out the volume, but neglected to kill the 
deal or at least change it to no confirm. So this is NOT a good deal - I'm 
killing it now.

Thanks,
Kate
