Yes, this is correct. Les Rawson, our services guy, did this deal which he 
explained is a little strange because the company we're buying generation 
from didn't want to provide firm energy, so we're selling the unit contingent 
instead of firm to Avista. Anyway, that's how he tried to explain it to me. I 
hope that helps.

Thanks,
Kate

P.S. Although the energy is correct in these deals, the days are not. I'll be 
changing 471884 and 471891 to reflect Mon. through Sat. on peak hours instead 
of M-S, Sundays and Holidays, on peak.

These two deals have the energy type as unit contingent.  Could you check and 
make sure this is correct?
#471884 and #471891

Thanks!
