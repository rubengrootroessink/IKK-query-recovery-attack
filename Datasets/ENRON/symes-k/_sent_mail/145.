I just spoke with Sean and he said he was indifferent on the subject - so you 
guys can go ahead and confirm these deals. I'm looking into why Puget sales 
seem to be coming up "no confirm." Thanks for checking, though.

Hi Kate,

There were several deals that were marked not to be confirmed that appeared 
to be normal west deals that we should confirm. We've already changed them to 
yes, but please check with Sean Crandell to see if he marked them not to be 
confirmed for a reason.
