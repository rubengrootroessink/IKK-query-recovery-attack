Wow! That's so exciting to see the words "clean checkout" associated with OUR 
beloved brokers and traders. Thanks for your persistence with all of this - I 
know it gets frustrating. Please let me know whenever I can help - I'm trying 
to respond quickly to the e-mails coming from Houston confirms, but in the 
interest of accuracy I'm also trying to be thorough. So feel free to give me 
a nudge every once in awhile.

Thanks,
Kate

Kate,

to cover my you know what.....this will be the new daily checkout for all of 
my brokers.  I am sending this to ensure a quality checkout to minimize any 
risks associated with our transactions.  Even if I don't have any errors I 
will still send a summary everyday of my checkouts for the west deals.  We 
have had several deals pop up from the brokers that we didn't know about and 
did not verbal the day of the trade and this will serve as proof of the 
previous days checkout. 


Amerex West Checkout

Prebon West Checkout

Thanks!!
