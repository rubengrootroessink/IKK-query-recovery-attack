I'm sorry if I confused you with my e-mail last night, but I think I might 
finally have the futures figured out. Now, instead of one deal number with no 
counterparty name, we now have two deal numbers, two counterparties, and the 
correct number of MW in each. Imagine that! Here is the updated information:

467455
10 MW
175.00
Palo Verde
Southern Company Energy Marketing
Mark Watson

469098
50 MW
175.00
Palo Verde
Sempra Energy Trading
Chris Bennett

I hope this makes more sense; please let me know if there's anything else I 
can do.

Thanks,
Kate
