Evelyn -
Here's the status of those year-long deals I changed last night. Everything 
should look good now - 571920 now has 25 mwh and 571801 is killed. Let me 
know if you still see something wrong.

Thanks,
Kate

Subject: Deal Change - Revision of last night's Deal Correction Report

This morning I was notified by Confirms in Houston that one of the deal 
changes I made last night didn't come through on their side. If you refer to 
the Deal Correction Report from yesterday, Mike Swerzbin did a deal with EES 
for Cal'03 that he mistakenly entered twice, once for Cal'03 (571920) and 
once for Cal'02 (571801). He killed 571920 and kept 571801, but the trade was 
actually for Cal'03. (Is everyone still with me?) So I restored 571920 and 
killed 571801 to reverse what he had done. But in my rush just before your 
calc last night I neglected to look at the volumes of the deal I was 
restoring, which incidently had been zeroed out, thus leaving Mike with no 
value for either of the deals. 

I've reinstated the volumes in deal 571920 and added the error to today's 
deal correction report. I just wanted to give you guys a heads up. Please let 
me know if you have questions.

Thanks,
Kate
