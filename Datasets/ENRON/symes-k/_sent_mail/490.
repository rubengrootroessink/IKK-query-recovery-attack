Tracy just told me this counterparty (PPL Montana) is still pending credit. 
Mike Swerzbin said he would prefer to wait this out, because he stands to 
make money on the deal. So in the meantime, I've been told by credit that we 
can't enter the deal in the system and calc it. I'm not sure how this works 
in your case with the Prebon check-out, but basically it's a pending credit 
deal that will potentially show up in our system once EPMI and PPL Montana 
reach an agreement. Does that help? Let me know.

Thanks,
Kate

this deal is contingent on credit - he'll let me know later today whether or 
not it's a good trade.

thanks,
Kate

Prebon sent over a confirm for a deal where:
Enron (Mike Swerzbin) buys from PPL Montana Cal'04-Cal'06 25 mw of Mid-C at 
$45.00 off-peak hours.

They did not tell me about this deal during checkout.  Can you please check 
with Mike.

Thanks!!
