These ARE a kind of desk-to-desk deal, but officially they are 
cross-portfolio deals, because they cross from the ENAEXEC to WEST portfolio. 
I'm not familiar with Unity, but let me check around here and see if anyone 
knows where these deals should be settled. Also let me know if the fact that 
they are cross-portfolio deals helps you at all. That's all I know right now.

Do the deals booked here need to go to Unify to be settled?  Are they desk to 
desk?  Sorry to bug you but I'm assigning contract numbers.
