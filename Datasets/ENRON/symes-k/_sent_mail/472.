Our IT group was able to solve the problem on this deal. It wouldn't save 
because the schedule type field was not populating correctly; which was a 
little disturbing because this is an EOL deal, and all fields should populate 
automatically. Dave Poston thinks he's fixed the problem, so you shouldn't 
run into anymore deals that won't save due to blank deal entry fields. If you 
do, though, please let Dave or me know and we'll look into it further. You 
should now be able to add to the deal clearing tab and save the deal.

Thanks,
