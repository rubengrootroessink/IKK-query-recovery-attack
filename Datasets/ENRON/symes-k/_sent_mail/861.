Broker is right - deal has been changed.

By the way, I checked out audit viewer on deal 505066, and it showed that I 
had changed the deal from Amerex to APB yesterday afternoon. It didn't show 
any other changed after that - so I've put a call into Duong Luu to figure 
out why the change didn't save, or why it defaulted back. Just FYI.
