I've modified these deals to read as follows:

572069
West Services buys from APX
NP-15
On Peak - 12 MW @ $245 for flow 4/6-4/7
Off Peak - 12 MW @ $150 for flow 4/7
TOTAL MWH = 480

576468
West Services buys from APX
NP-15
Off Peak - 12 MW @ $140 for flow 4/6
TOTAL MWH = 96

Please let me know if this is correct. (I hope!) And don't hesitate to call 
me with questions or other deal corrections. I will be running between two 
different desks today, so if you can't reach me at my regular extension 
(503-464-7486), I can be reached at 503-464-3823.

Thanks,
Kate

Kate:

Can you please modify that deal that you made the price $140 yesterday to 
make it for the 6th only?  The 7th is all at $150.

Thanks

Chris,
Good morning!  Hey, one thing I probably did not clarify to you yesterday on 
was that when the new deal ticket was set up for the $140 price strip (Deal 
#576468.1), the deal should only be in for (4/6/2001) according to APX's 
statement (not including 4/7/2001).  Therefore, the entire offpeak for your 
deal would be booked on Deal #572069.1 for the $150 price for 4/7/2001.  Let 
me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Chris,
One more quick thing on 4/6/2001- APX is showing 2 different prices for 
offpeak ($140 & $150 - different MW per strip).  EPMI is showing $150 @ 12/MW 
per offpeak hours.  This difference amounts to a $144 difference (APX has 
lower invoice).  Can you verify?  Everything else is fine....talk to you next 
week.  Have a good weekend.
