Yes, it should have been Sierra Pacific Power Co. I've changed it in EnPower. 
These traders' heads are starting to spin with all the variations on 
counterparty names, as I'm sure yours is as well!

Thanks,
Kate

One more question, I promise.  Bob Badeer did this deal and entered it as 
Sierra Pacific Industries and I just changed it to Holding Company.  Should 
it have been Sierra Pacific Power Company because the delivery is Palo Verde 
and the Holding Co. deals are all SP15.
