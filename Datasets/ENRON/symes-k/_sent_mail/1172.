God, that's so nice of you to thank me. So many of my students just spread 
their little wings and fly away, forgetting that I MADE them goddamit. 
Anyway, I'm glad you had fun in Maui. I honestly think it's pretty much 
impossible not to. I'm getting ready to go back, hopefully at the end of this 
winter when I'm nice and frostbitten, in time to see the whales, which by 
then will be like my family as I will have spent the previous six months 
porking out on turkey and stuffing and washing it down with quarts of eggnog. 

If you're planning any more trips in the future, my full list of city guides 
can be accessed at www.katerockstheworld.com. It's a start-up operation, but 
I plan on retiring in about.....wait, hold on.....I just retired.

See ya!
