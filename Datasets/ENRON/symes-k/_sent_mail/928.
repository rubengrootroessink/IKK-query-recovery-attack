I think you're right, but the trader just took off for lunch. I'll check with 
him and kill the duplicate deal if necessary, then let you know when it's 
done.

Thanks,
Kate

Hi Kate,

For Ref 499391 I don't think this is a good deal because Prebon only shows 
one off-peak deal like this and it is our reference 499390.


Thanks
