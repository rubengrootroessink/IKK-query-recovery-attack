Who's ready to rhumba? Crystal Ballroom holds salsa classes on the first 
Tuesday of every month. The hour-long class begins at 7p.m., with live music 
and dancing afterward. Cost is $8 for the whole evening. The other Tuesdays 
of the month have live music and dancing, and sometimes classes too. Anyway, 
I'm sure it won't take us more than an hour to become master Latin dancers on 
par with Ricky Martin and Christina Aguilera.

Do you want to try it out? Next class is Jan. 23. And there is actually a 
salsa event going on at the Crystal this Friday night with bands and dancing 
and all kinds of mayhem - it's $12 and doors open at 7 p.m. Mark your 
calendars and tell all your coordinated (and/or good-looking) friends to come 
along.

*Does this mean "live dance" or "dance lives" or "my friend Viva likes the 
way you dance" or none of the above?
