Just curious - did you ever catch up with Larry Joe Hunter regarding the Long 
Term Southwest desk's futures deal with Sempra? I'm wondering if I should 
grab Matt Motley before he goes home today to let him know he needs to get a 
hold of Tim Cannon about the ADT. Let me know when and if you talk to him.

Thanks,
Kate
