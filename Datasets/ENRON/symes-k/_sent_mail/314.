563906 - changed to Pinnacle West
563907 - changed to Pinnacle West
562226 - changed to APS

Regarding the last deal, Mike Driscoll talked to his broker at Bloomberg last 
night and asked him to change their confirm to say Pinnacle West. The broker 
said he'd check on it, but that Bloomberg hadn't switched their contract over 
yet and he didn't know if they could check a deal out under the new name. So 
we left it, under the impression that Bloomberg was actually in the wrong. My 
question is - has APS switched over to Pinnacle West entirely, and when or if 
Bloomberg starts recognizing Pinnacle as the counterparty are we going to 
have problems with deals containing the old counterparty name? I'm just 
trying to clarify, so I can let the traders know what to expect. Thanks for 
your help.

Kate, 

I just spoke to DeeDee of Pinnacle West, we verballed deals and she said all 
deals should be under the Pinnacle West name unless for Bloomberg 
transactions.   Please review the following 

Mark Fischer
563906.01  non brokered > cp name should be Pinnacle West
563907.01  non brokered > cp name should be Pinnacle West

562226.01  Bloomberg, cp name should be Arizona Public Service.  (Evelyn 
inquired about this yesterday)

Thanks for your help!
Stephanie
