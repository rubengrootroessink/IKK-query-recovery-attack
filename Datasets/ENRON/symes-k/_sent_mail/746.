We don't have fees on the BUY side of an EES sleeve - this particular deal is 
the sale side. Unfortunately, Matt had scribbled something next to this deal 
that looked like "no bro" which usually indicates no fee, but it was actually 
".015 bro." Anyway, that's probably more information than you 
needed.....sorry!

Kate

Just changed it - Matt's book had a .015 fee in it, so I changed it to that. 
Does Natsource agree?
