I'm having Chris Foster check on these deals. Stewart is overseas for the 
holidays and won't be back for awhile, so in the meantime Chris and I will do 
our best to find out which deals he was referring to. Let me know if anything 
resembling these deals comes up on your end.

Thanks,
Kate

Stewart called last Friday and said there would be some deals for the City of 
Roseville to be confirmed.  He did not have deal numbers for these deals, and 
so far, I have not seen any deals for this counterparty.  Do you know 
anything about these deals?  Can check around and see if anyone else knows 
about them?

Thanks!
