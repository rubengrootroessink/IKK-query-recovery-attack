P.S. I mentioned this to you, Melissa. But just a reminder that we need the 
default broker fee on this to be $.03.

Thank you!

Subject: New Broker: Automated Power Exchange

Chris Foster has requested that we set up a new broker - the Automated Power 
Exchange, in EnPower. It is the same counterparty we already have in EnPower, 
with the same name and contact information. Melissa, I believe you said we 
could pretty easily add the name in the broker list if it was the same as in 
the counterparty list, which Chris has verified it is. Please let me know if 
you need anymore information.

Thanks,
Kate
