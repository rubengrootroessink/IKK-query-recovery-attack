BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

OIL PRODUCTS
Congratulations to the US Oil Products Trading Team!  On October 4, 2000 th=
ey=20
successfully completed a deal with a volume of 2,400,000 barrels with a=20
Notional Value of $80,640,000.  This is the highest Notional Value associat=
ed=20
with an EOL trade.

Kudos again for another great deal. They have done another large=20
crack-spread, this time for 100,000 barrels per month for calendar 2001. Th=
is=20
trade notionally values out at over $40 million and is the second largest=
=20
transaction conducted to date on EOL.

STEEL
Steel Trading and Origination teams, headed by Greg Hermans and Tim=20
Battaglia, respectively, have already defined a Hot-Rolled coil financial=
=20
product.  The contract has been drafted and is currently being discussed wi=
th=20
customers.

Financial Hot Rolled Steel will be posted on EnronOnline, allowing the stee=
l=20
industry to hedge their price exposure for the first time in history. The=
=20
access to hedging products will help the steel industry manage technicaliti=
es=20
and smooth cash flow.  Over time, forward price curves with transparent=20
pricing should allow the steel industry to also benefit from improved acces=
s=20
to capital.

The next challenge will be to educate the steel industry about financial=20
swaps and derivatives as risk management tools.  The $300 billion steel=20
market should provide an excellent growth opportunity for Enron.

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS

ce=20
