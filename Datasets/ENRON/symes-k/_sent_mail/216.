Joanie!
I have been soooo busy lately and I'm starting to feel like I sold my soul to 
the Enron devil. In fact, I have no time to be writing this e-mail right now, 
but I've been meaning to drop a line and catch up with you. I also just ran 
into Brigdet (from the class below us at SMA) at lunch - apparently she's 
married to some baseball player. Crazy! So right away I had to contact my 
ever-realistic "single" friend to bring me some sanity. I'm actually dating a 
guy right now, but it still gives me the chills to hear about anyone near my 
age walking down the toilet...I mean aisle. Anyway, call me, or I'll call you 
tonight - let's dish! I hope everything's great with you - I expect nothing 
less. I have lots of interesting stories to tell about how and why I've come 
to the decision that I'm sending my roommates to rehab.

Love,
Kate
