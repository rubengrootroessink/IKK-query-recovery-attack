Mark - I'm so sorry I haven't responded yet, but yes, I did get your e-mail. 
I actually solved most of the issues detailed on the spreadsheet, but wanted 
to finish before I sent the document back. I've attached the spreadsheet with 
what I've done so far, and I'm forwarding most of the remaining deals to Bill 
Williams in Real Time. The two deals with volume discrepancies are going to 
take some looking into - I think they're in the system correctly and it's 
probably just an error in my spreadsheet - but I'll let you know. Again, 
sorry for the delay.

Thanks,
Kate

Subject: Hello Kate

Kate did you receive my e-mail from the weekend for EES April activity?   I 
know you may not had time to look at them, I just want to make sure the 
e-mail got to you since it was the weekend when I forwarded it to you.

Thanks,

Mark
