I just forwarded this e-mail to Stan and then spoke with him about the 
confirm on this deal. He said he's never received a letter of confirmation on 
these Valley Electric deals - they just verbally confirm them. I've given him 
your name, and he should be contacting you shortly to discuss how to proceed 
on this. Please let me know how I can help.

Thanks,
Kate

In regard to this deal, could you please email me a copy of the confirmation 
that the trader prepares.  We will need to put a copy into the our files.  We 
will also need a copy of the executed confirmation for our files.

Thanks!

When you change this to no confirm, please put a note in the comment section 
about why we are not domfirming it, because it falls within our guidelines to 
confirm and at somepoint, I will be asked why we did not confirm this deal.

Thanks!

Deal should be no confirm. It was done by Stan Cocke in Services, and those 
guys deal directly with their counterparty contacts. He thought he marked 
this no confirm, but must have defaulted to confirm anyway. I'll change deal 
as soon as risk is done with their calc.
