Sure - anytime. I usually do lunch around 11:30 - so I can get back in time 
to weather the afternoon storm! Let me know what works for you.

Kate

P.S. I hope you had a great birthday party on Saturday! I wanted to make it, 
but ended up on a terribly boring date instead. Go figure.

Hey Kate-
I'd be interested in talking to you more about Deal Control.  Let me know if 
you want to grab a coffee or lunch sometime soon.
Thanks!
Em

No problem! That's very sweet of you to thank me, though. It was my pleasure.

Dear Kate,

Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to job shadow with you in Deal 
Control.  I loved your metaphor for the wheels of the clock and how all the 
cogs in the wheels need to match up.  I also enjoyed seeing how "scraps" are 
used and that there is trading between desks within Enron.  You do such a 
great job at being in the moment and keeping your cool when new tasks come 
your way throughout the day.  Your time and patience in answering my 
questions and helping me understand how it all fits together is much 
appreciated.

With gratitude,
Emily
