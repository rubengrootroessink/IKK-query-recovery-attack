I'd like to enroll in the Enron Savings Plan program; however, when I was 
navigating through the savings plan website, I started wondering if the 
retirement plan and the self-directed brokerage account are the same thing. I 
think you probably have some information regarding these plans. Could I 
borrow that later this afternoon, or even better, sit down with you for a 
minute to clarify which plans I am eligible to enroll in and when? Thanks in 
advance for your time.
