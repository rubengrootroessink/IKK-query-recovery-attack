Note to Real Time desk:
EES sent over revised volumes for delivery at SP-15 after I sent the 
spreadsheet out today. Please disregard the variance volumes for that 
delivery point. Instead, make a note of the new volumes, shown in red under 
the heading "EPMI Length" directly to the right of the "Var" column. Contact 
your fearless leader, Bill Williams III, with questions, comments, and 
concerns.
