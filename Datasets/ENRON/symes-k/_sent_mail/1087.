These two are the same deal. We just added TFS in there as the broker - Mike 
forgot that. But we recognize the trade as Cal-01, not Q3-01. Mike just 
talked to the broker, who's going to pull the tapes from Friday to determine 
who's correct, but for now he wants to leave it as Cal-01. I'll let you know 
if we hear otherwise.

Thanks,
Kate
