I've changed deals 581499 and 581605 to Sierra Pacific Power. They're suposed 
to be transmission deals, they were just in with the wrong counterparty name. 
And thanks again for working so hard to finalize this Sierra Pacific Holding 
Co. thing.

Kate

Kate, I am changing the forwards to the HOlding Company.  There are 2 
transmission deals with Sierra Pacific Industries that I think should be 
Buy/Resales.  We do not have transmission with either entity.  Can you check 
and see if the counterparty should be changed or they should be Buy/Resales?  
Thanks.
