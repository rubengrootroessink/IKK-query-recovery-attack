Diana says Amerex told her both deals were on the same ticket - so she 
entered deal 577201at 50 mw. I asked her to get ahold of her contact at 
Amerex to tell them they're checking out incorrectly.

Thanks,
Kate

What's the status?

AMEREX
I see several sales to Puget in Diana's blotter at a $375 price, only one 
with Amerex, and it's for 50 MW. I'll need to get ahold of her in the morning 
to verify the brokers on these. I'll let you know as soon as I do.
