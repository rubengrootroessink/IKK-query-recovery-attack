Kate-
    I'm going for a run..uh, walk in the park to unwind from another busy
day.  Did I already RE???  I think I was in process when I was abruptly
booted off my system.  I rarely read too deeply into the metaphysics of
internet territoriality, but let's just say I was a bit freaked out.
    In other news, I was invited, as a resident shoe expert, to come fix the
feet of a certain director on a certain Paramount movie set in town...and do
I feel important??  I'll keep you updated as to whether this particular 15
minutes of fame is actually THE one, or just a facade to a deeper and more
rewarding 15 minutes somewhere down the road.
    On Gatsby - don't have it yet and implicit in this status is my inability
to compete with one so driven to ultimate domination in the category of
intellectual enormity...I am the microscopic parasite to a four-limbed,
crafty predator that disguises itself, like a siren, as a mere passenger on
the food train.
    Miss you in a sort of in-town way. Perhaps we should get together and do
this in person soon?  I am worried about your little heart, my "playuh"
positioning, and wasting the short two month window that is inevitably the
range of my welcome.
    In the "get-on-with-it"  realm, I'm out.  Call me.  Home is 224-7243 and
cell is 890-6370 in case you've misplaced the card...or something.  Any
malapropisticism was incidental this time around.

Dave
