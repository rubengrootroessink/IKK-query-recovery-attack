It looks like your Deal Blotter settings may be defaulting to PST time zone. 
But these April deals need to flow during the PDT time zone. Could you check 
your settings and make sure the time zone defaults to PPT (that way the 
strips will choose PST or PDT accordingly)?

Two additional deals were changed to the correct time zone:
534074
534072
534071
534053

Thanks,
Kate

Kate,

these are the following deals I have amended the time zones to PPT instead of 
PST and amended the strips to reflect the change:
534066
534473
534077
534078
534064
534058

Also, these are only the brokered deals between Tom and Mark.  There may be 
some non-brokered deals in enpower with a flow of April and the time zone 
needs to be changed to PPT and the strips amended as well.  Can you please 
run a query and check the other deals to make sure the time zone is correct 
because if not they will not be scheduled correctly for April. 

If you have any question please call me.  


Thanks!!
