Bob Badeer informed me that these deals have already been confirmed, possibly 
by you. Could you let me know if this is in fact true? If it is, I will go 
ahead and make a note in the comments section of the deals.

Thanks,
Kate

Subject: Avista deals

There are two deals for Avista the are marked not to be confirmed.  Can you 
check into these, and if they are not to be confirmed, put a little note as 
to why or who said not to confirm them, so 6 months from now when someone 
says "Why didn't you confirm this deal!"  I'll have something to jog my 
memory.  (Because I will have slept between now and then!)

Deal Numbers #487050 and 487054

Thanks!
