The deal has been fixed. I'm so sorry about that - when I changed the dates 
at the top, the computer asked if I'd like it to copy the changes into the 
strips. I should have checked to make sure it did this correctly! 

And I will definitely add notes in the comments section of deals I change 
from now on. Thanks for the tip.

Kate

Whatever you changed on this deal, it now reads that it flows 32 hours a 
day!  You have five strips in, each flowing for 16 hours.

Also, when you change a deal, if you could make small note about what you 
changed in the comment section of deal entry, if really makes things go 
faster.  We know what change to look for when we make the revision.

Let me know when it is fixed.

Thanks!
