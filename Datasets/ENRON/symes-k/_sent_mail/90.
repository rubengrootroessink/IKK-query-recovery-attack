Following are the deal numbers for interdesk swaps between STCA and STWBom 
for Monday and Tuesday. I'm sorry again for forgetting on Friday.

587941
STCA sells 25 to STWBom
4/23/01
$231.23
PGE3

589743
STCA sells 25 to STWBom
4/24/01
$266.00
NP-15

Let me know if you have questions on these. I presume Phil talked to you 
about why he put the deal in at PGE3 for Monday and NP15 for Tuesday. 
Apparently it doesn't have any relevance until FSP is up and running, but it 
may affect you guys differently. Just let us know if it's a problem.

Thanks,
Kate
