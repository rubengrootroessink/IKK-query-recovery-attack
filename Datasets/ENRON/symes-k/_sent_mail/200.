Broker is right - I've changed the deals to Allegheny Energy Supply Co.

Thanks,
Kate

Subject: Allegheny Energy deals

We got a call from Allegheny Energy Electric Cooperative complaining that we 
have sent confirmations for deals that they do not have.  Could you check on 
these two deals.  The broker paper has these deals with Allegheny Energy 
Supply Company.
