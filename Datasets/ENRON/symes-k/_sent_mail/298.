The unit on this deal is Las Vegas Cogeneration - and I asked Les to start 
entering the specific unit in the comments section of unit-contingent deals. 
Let me know if he does or does not.....

Thanks,
Kate

This is a unit contingent deal.  We have been told that we have to have the 
unit name to include in the confirmation when we confirm these deals.  Can 
you have the traders add the unit name in the comment section whe they do 
unit contingent deals?

Thanks!
