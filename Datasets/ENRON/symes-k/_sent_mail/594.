Option terms are not reflected in the system. Trade date has been changed to 
2/22 - reflects trade date in CDWR confirmation letter. I've left a copy of 
the confirm letter on your desk just in case. Let me know if you have 
questions.

do not reflect the option in the system.  we will take care of that if we 
exercise the option.  it would be good to get the proper transaction 
execution date in there.

Tim - would you like a copy of this deal's confirmation letter?

Carla - you entered this deal on 2/23/01. Should it be back-dated to match 
trade date on confirmation letter?

Thanks,
Kate
