Prebon
Sean Crandall
549048 - changed to NP

Diana Scholtes
Prebon broker said our price (215) and del. point (Cob) are right

Jeff Richter
549013 - changed to APB

549010 - enron buys BP/Apr01/NP/peak/207.00 (in with Amerex - should it be 
Prebon?)

Chris Mallory - just entered Williams deal

AMEREX
All deals checked out fine



PREBON

Sean Crandall
deal 549048
Prebon shows del. point as NP-15 


Diana Scholtes
deal 549053
Prebon shows price as $141 and delivery pt as Mid-C


Jeff Richter
deal 549013
Prebon does not recognize

I am missing the following:
1) Enron buys from BP Energy 25 mw of April'01 NP-15 peak hrs at $207
2) Enron buys Williams 25 mw of SP-15 of April'01 off-peak hrs at $107




BLOOMBERG
