Thanks! You guys are adorable. When I become technologically advanced enough 
to get a picture of myself onto the computer, I promise to send it over. In 
the meatime, just picture me as a Cindy Crawford type, only thinner. :-)

And on the subject of the BPA deal - I just spoke with Val Sabo, who's 
working with Greg Wolfe and Tim Belden to get this deal done. Apparently it's 
a good deal; it was put into the system and calculated, then taken out and is 
currently being re-negotiated. When Greg and Tim come to an agreement with 
BPA, they will most likely send you a revised confirmation. So in the 
meantime, Val says to hold off doing anything. We'll keep you posted.

Thanks for checking up on this.

Kate

Just thought it would be a nice idea if you knew who you were talking to in 
the Houston office.
