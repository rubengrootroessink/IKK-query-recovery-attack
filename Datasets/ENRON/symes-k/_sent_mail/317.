The missing Richter trades are all EES sleeves that he neglected to enter 
before leaving for Houston this afternoon. Since Risk is running their calc, 
Chris Mallory said he's enter the deals first thing in the morning. 

The Fischer deals - 563728 and 563729 - have been changed to Constellation, 
per Matt Motley who did the trades.

And the other two deals where the brokers have been changed look fine. Would 
you let me know beforehand next time, just in the offhand chance that the 
trader entered other things in the deal incorrectly? Thanks for your help.

Kate
