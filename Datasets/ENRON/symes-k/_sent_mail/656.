Here are details of the problem we're having with the Tagg IQ Reports:

Three Mid-Columbia futures trades were executed by Matt Motley, Long Term 
Southwest Desk, on 2/5, 2/6, and 2/7.
Trades pulled into Tagg IQ Reports -
 All three pull into Future Daily Transaction Report (RSX0245F.IQR) 
 Only two pull into Future Net Position Summary (RXSNSUMF.IQR)
 All three pull into Tagg Exchange Capture search - transaction IDs are 
980362/983837/987050
 All three pulled into Tagg Metacalc (Meta ID 77771 - Post ID 1035917 - Post 
ID 77880 - Post ID 1037269) until 2/9 - NOW GONE

Because today is the Nymex Electricity Futures exercise date, we need to know 
as soon as possible for our calculations whether or not these deals are in 
the system, and if not, where they went. My confusion lies in the fact that I 
can find these deals when I do a search in Tagg for any futures deals traded 
at the Mid-C settlement index, and yet the Risk group can no longer see 
anything for Mid-C in their calculation. Please let me know what you find.

Thank you,
Kate
