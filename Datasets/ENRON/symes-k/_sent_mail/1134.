Yeah - I pretty much became part of the furniture yesterday as I recouped 
from the brutality of that weekend. I ended up at a random friend's house at 
about 4 a.m., then proceeded to down a couple beers and head for bed at about 
6:30. I could not believe it when my alarm went off this morning - it's a 
cruel, cruel world when you've got a social schedule like ours. But I 
definitely had a good time Saturday, despite the fact that I was ditched by 
my ride and locked out of my house, which is never fun after a dozen 
cocktails. All in all, though, great party.
