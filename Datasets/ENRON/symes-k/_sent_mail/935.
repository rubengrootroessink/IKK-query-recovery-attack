You're right - bankruptcy is a likely move for PG&E. But this deal was 
entered in place of an existing position we had with PG&E in the California 
Power Exchange, and it's been approved by our legal and credit departments.

Let me know if you have further questions.

Thanks,
Kate

This deal is with PG&E.  I thought they were going into bankruptcy.  Can you 
check and see if this is a wrong co name or what.

Thanks!
