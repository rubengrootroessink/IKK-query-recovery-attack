That sounds great. Just let me know when you guys are ready to run the test 
upload. I can validate the deals and help work out any glitches, although it 
sounds like everything will go smoothly.

Thanks for all your hard work on this - having the swaps automated will make 
my job much easier. Now you can kick back and relax before you make my job 
obsolete!
