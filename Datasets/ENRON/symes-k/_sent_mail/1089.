Don't worry about it. Actually, I kind of like to know what the schedulers 
are dealing with, as oftentimes in the thick of things they're too busy to 
explain to me why and how something I do affects them. It's all about the 
chain reaction in this place, I'm beginning to notice. Heaven forbid I was 
the weak link!
