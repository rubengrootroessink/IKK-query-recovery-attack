Thanks!  Stewart had already called me this morning about this deal and had 
someone in risk change the other two legs.

It looks like only leg 4 had firm energy - I changed that to CAISO. Legs 2 
and 3 already had CAISO energy, and leg 1 is killed. Is that okay?

These two legs are entered with NP-15 delivery points with firm energy.  Let 
me know if this is correct.

Thanks!
