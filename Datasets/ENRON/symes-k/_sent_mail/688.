Thanks for thinking of me during your consolidated e-mail spree. It's always 
nice to arrive at work Monday (or in this case Tuesday) morning and receive 
something other than urgent, faceless messages demanding my immediate 
attention. I received those as well this morning, of course, but being who I 
am decided to respond urgently to the frivolous ones and frivolously to the 
urgent ones.

Your Sunday sounds incredibly more productive than mine - pity. After a quick 
survey of the very little mess left after you two left (THANK YOU!), Molly 
and I decided to bag any further cleaning and instead go for a drive through 
some of the nicer Portland neighborhoods, admiring gardens here and paint 
colors there. Everyone was out enjoying the crisp sunshine and inhaling our 
exhaust fumes. But watching from our comfortable car seats was about all we 
could muster after the weekend's debaucheries. Then we returned home for a 
movie marathon that did not, you correctly assumed, include the Philadelphia 
story. We did watch two fabulous films - "The Virgin Suicides" and 
"Croupier," both of which I highly recommend. We built a gigantic bed out of 
couch cushions and drank chamomile tea until we passed out. 

Amber the mysteriously absent roommate turned up Monday afternoon, and I was 
amazingly more angry than I had previously thought, mostly because she walked 
into the house smacking of defensiveness, ready to fight. So rather than 
disappoint her expectations, I gave her what she wanted, only with more 
volume. If the neighbors didn't hear us Saturday night, they can be sure 
somebody lives there now.

I've got a call in to my friend Scott to locate Mr. Down Under Wine guy. In 
my slightly more sober state, I'm starting to feel like he may own a winery 
in Australia, not New Zealand. We'll find out for sure later today. And I'll 
let you know when I hear from him.

Thanks again for making the trip DOWN to Portland - you guys were great 
company. I'd love to come to Seattle this weekend; however, I never make 
plans more than one day in advance. I've found myself to be much too flaky 
for that. Let me know if you need notice sooner than that. 

Take care,
Kate

I know you won't get this until Tuesday, I just thought I'd write for the 
purposes of consolidation. It was great meeting you and thanks for your 
hospitality and easy-going ways. I wonder if you watched the Philadelphia 
story. Probably not, but it's not going anywhere. It's a bright sunny day 
here in Seattle and, over a couple?of cups of coffee, I wrote all morning. At 
some point I'm going to go outside and do something today. A walk around the 
lake perhaps or a hike through the woods. 
?
Anyway, I don't have a lot to say. Thanks in advance for your help in getting 
me in touch with the New Zealand dude and do think seriously about coming 
down for dinner next weekend. Stay in touch,
jordan
