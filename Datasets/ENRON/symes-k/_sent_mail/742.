Trades with TransAlta go through their energy marketing subsidiary, called 
TransAlta Energy Marketing (US) Inc. These deals were in under the parent 
company, TransAlta Energy Marketing Corp. I know this is petty, but it makes 
people like Rhonda cranky. For some reason she feels it is an offense 
punishable by reaming. I don't. This is just a  reminder.

Okay, I'm going to be gentle and send my complaints to you and let you ream 
the hourly people.  Please check the following deals.  They are all booked as 
Transalta Energy and should be Transalta Energy Marketing (US)
