You're right, this was an Altra deal that was entered as Prebon. Only one 
deal.

Thanks,
Kate

Kate-
I have received a Altra Broker Confirmation Letter, but I have no trade in 
system

Enron Buys  Idaho
Np 15
Dec 2000

Although we do have deal 459637.01  with prebon as broker that fits the deal.
Are there two deals alike or should the broker be altra on that deal.
please let me know
thanks
