Wow - what a nice Friday morning surprise to hear from my old friend Bobby. 
We must go back, what, at least half a year? Hey, it's no fun around our 
house with you being a stranger and all. We're having people over for a 
barbeque tonight - come by! Call me at work - 464-7486 - or catch someone at 
home later - 288-6546. We have to celebrate the beginning of spring, and 
you're not exempt. Have a super day at work. Talk to you later?

Kate
