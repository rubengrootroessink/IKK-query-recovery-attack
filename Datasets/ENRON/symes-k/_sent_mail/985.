Amber and I actually had a successful house-hunting weekend. Molly decided to 
get in on the bargain at the last minute, and as it turns out, finding a 
3-bedroom house is a lot easier and cheaper than a 2-bedroom. We found three 
places in NE that look great, so mark your calendar for the house-warming 
party in a couple weeks.

As far as Vietnam vacations go, I don't see one in my near future. First of 
all, I find it difficult to take either one of you seriously - your favorite 
phrases are "baby" and "poppa" for god's sake. Secondly, I have about 10 
countries on my list of places to go that precede Vietnam. And finally, it 
sounds a little precarious to fly halfway across the world to visit someone I 
hardly know who seems to be in serious denial about his status as a man with 
a significant other.

Other than that, you can tell Chris I'll see what I can do.

Kate

Kate,

I'll lay off the "Date with Destiny" stuff...I was becoming bored with it as
well.  How was your weekend?  Did you and Amber go house hunting?  I had a
great time at the beach with the boys.  Chris asked me to tell you that he
wants you to come to Vietnam.

Take care,
Roberto

"Pretty tired" is the understatement of the century. What a way to kick off
my New Year's Resolution of staying home on weeknights. And things promise
to only get worse - I think Amber and I are getting a place together. I'm
not sure I'll survive another month of this kind of social life.

You know, "date with destiny" is getting a little old. Can you come up with
something more original?

Kate
