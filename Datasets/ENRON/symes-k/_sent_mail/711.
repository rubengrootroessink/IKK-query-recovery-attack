Matt Motley
deal 524143
Per Amerex the price should be $263 not $163 - price changed to $263

Mike Swerzbin
deal 524171
Per Amerex the price should be $300 not $310 - price changed to $300

deal 524172
Per Amerex the price should be $300 not $310 - price changed to $300

deal 524267
Per Amerex the total mw should be 50 not 25 - MW should be 25 - other side of 
sleeve is 25 MW

deal 524310
Per Amerex the term should be March not April - term should be April

I am missing the following deal:
Enron buys from EES 25 mw of off-peak Mid-C for Q3'01 at $285.95. - 524248 - 
part of a spread sleeve done with EES and El Paso - only one broker fee 
agreed upon - fee included on deal 524247 NOT 524248

Jeff Richter
deal 523881
Per Amerex the term should be 2/17 only not 2/17-2/18 - on peak deal - does 
not calculate any volume for 2/18 because it is a Sunday (all off peak hours)

deal 523882
Per Amerex the term should be 2/17 only not 2/17-2/18 - same as above

The above trades were entered in Jeff's deal blotter with a Saturday/Sunday 
mask; I guess Carla has done this before and said it shouldn't make a 
difference because Sunday is an off-peak day and these are on-peak deals. If 
it does make a difference in reference to your group, please let me know and 
I'll be happy to pass the message on to the traders and anyone else who 
enters deals. I can also change those deals if necessary.

Thanks,
Kate
