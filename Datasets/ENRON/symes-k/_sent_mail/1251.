I've put a call in to Mike Driscoll to see which deal is correct. He "fixed" 
them yesterday, but frankly I have no idea what he really did, as they still 
look completely different. As soon as I confirm with him, I'll change the 
deals and let you know.

Thanks,
Kate

deal number 458405 and 458406 still do not match total mw quantity.  pls let 
me know which one is correct, and if they should both be the same.

Mike Driscoll went in and changed this deal to match 458405. It should be 
correct now.
