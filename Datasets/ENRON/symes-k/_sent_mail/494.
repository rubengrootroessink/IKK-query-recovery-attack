Yes, that's fine if you bring the discrepancies by later. Or I can swing by 
your desk to get them. I think I know why Mark is confused about the price. 
At the beginning of this month we started running into situations where we 
had to purchase from EES in addition to selling to them - which is all we had 
been doing to cover their load before. We determined, however, that when EPMI 
buys from EES, the price should be $5 less than our fixed price average for 
the day. (When EPMI sells to EES, the price is $5 more than the fixed price 
average.) In this way, we're still making our profit from the coverage of 
their load. Either the correct price is not reflected in the spreadsheet we 
sent them, or we purchased at the wrong price - we were working the kinks out 
right at the beginning of March, so it makes sense that they'd have questions 
regarding that time frame.

Also, I've already talked with Daniel Kang at EES to work out some 
discrepancies with him. He asked about volumes at the beginning of March, but 
didn't seem to have a question about price, so I'm wondering if everyone over 
there is communicating with each other. Please let me know what I can do to 
resolve this - and feel free to send Mark my way when he has questions.

Dear Kate, 

Just a heads-up that I sent this to Bill,  so he may be asking you what the 
problems have been with EES.
Could I bring by the discrepancies a bit later?

Thanks,

Virginia

Dear Bill, 

Please read forward below.
I've seen a few problems with EES lately.  Last month, Kate Symes took care 
of the differences (she knows more about EES).  You may want to contact her 
to find out what has been happening lately to cause the differences.  Sorry - 
don't know much more.

Virginia

Virginia, please take a look at DMS #'s  7365 & 7367.  These are the start of 
the EES differences for March.  Both of these have to do with the ST-Whourly 
desk where we are lower by $5.00 then what EES has.  I spoke with Thresa and 
she suggested we have Bill Williams look at these in case their is a trend 
started for the month and we can catch it now.

Thanks,

Mark
