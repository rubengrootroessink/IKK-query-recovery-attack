I see that both of these deals have counterparty contact names in them now - 
did this get taken care of by somebody else? I'm sorry for the late response 
- I was out sick on Friday. Let me know if there's something else I can do on 
these deals.

Subject: contact names

There are two deals that do not have contact names.  Can you check with the 
trader and get him to enter names.  The confirmation has to have a contact 
name or it cannot be prepared.

Thanks!

Deals #500465 and #500467
