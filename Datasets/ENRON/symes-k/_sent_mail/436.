Thank you in advance for you help in adding this trader's name to the system:

Add this Power Trader to the EnPower: Paul Choi

Samuel Schott has told me that you would prefer to have the desk this trader 
works for, but because Paul is a mid-marketer he works with several different 
desks, including Long Term California and Long Term Southwest. Please let me 
know if you need more information.

Thanks,
Kate Symes
