Willie -
Per our conversation - the West Power desk needs three new settlement indices 
for entering swaps deals in EnPower. The indices are as follows:

Last day settle for MIDC NYMEX contract
Last 5-day average for PALO VERDE NYMEX contract
Last 5-day average for COB NYMEX contract

Please let me know if you have any questions. The first index is a little 
more pressing than the other two - one of our traders did a futures deal a 
week ago which we have yet to swap from his book to the one it belongs in. We 
can't execute the swap until we have a MIDC settlement index. 

Thank you so much for your help.
