All Matt Motley's deal JUST went in, so you should see those coming through.

Chris Mallory checked with Prebon - this is a sale - it's been changed.

Diana checked Bloomberg - they show 25 mw and so do we for a total of 800 
mw....??

Enron buys Reliant 50 mw of Q3 SP-15 at $300
Enron sells Williams 25 mw of April SP-15 at $203
Enron sells El Paso 25 mw of June PV at $260

Prebon shows Enron as seller not buyer
