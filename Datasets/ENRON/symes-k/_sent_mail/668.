The expiry should be 2003, and it's been changed. Thanks for catching that.

Kate, this trade has an expiry date of 2001 when it is suppose to be 2003. 
Mike Driskil entered the trade. I have BPA's confirm that also verifies and 
the notes in the bottom of the comment section. Please change if correct.

Thanks,

Kimberly
