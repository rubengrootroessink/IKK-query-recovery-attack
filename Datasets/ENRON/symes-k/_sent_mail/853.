I can certainly send you this file each day - I hope it can be of some help. 
All the deals it lists are with EPMI Short Term California, which is myself 
or Jeff Richter; so I'm not sure how helpful it will be in determining which 
desk or counterparty you have discrepancies with. While we're on the subject 
of sharing files, though, I had spoken with the confirmation group in Houston 
about the deal file you send them each day. They suggested I ask to be added 
to the list so I can better assist their group in finding discrepancies in 
EPMI-EES deals. If that's okay with you, I would appreciate receiving it.

In the meantime, I'll copy you on the EES sale prices starting tomorrow.

Thanks,
Kate

Kate,
I am in the confirmation group with EES and try to tie out our confirmtions 
with the EPMI list I receive from Kim Hundle (EPMI), on a weekly basis.  This 
file would be great help with this process.  Is there any way you could send 
this to me as well? This would help me determine who the problem is with.  I 
would appreciate it.  
Thanks 
Judy D
