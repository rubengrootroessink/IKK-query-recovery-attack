I thought it might behoove you guys to know about this, even though I am 
unclear as to its meaning myself. Basically, Cara made a change in scheduling 
that she did not change in Enpower, and it has to do with an ongoing deal 
being managed by the short and long term northwest desks. 

In addition, Carla and I zeroed out a deal for Diana Scholtes in scheduling - 
473338 - selling to Modesto at NP-15 for BOM on peak. For some reason, she 
just needed it zeroed out for tomorrow, so we did not change the deal in deal 
entry. If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks,
Kate

Subject: Smurfit Deals

I show now two Smurfit Deals,

403522 for 25 flat, at 54.65,    and 246859.1 for 15  hlh, AND 25 hlh,   and 
246859 for 15 llh AND 25 llh.

I have zeroed out the 25's from 246859 in Scheduling, and we are flat now.  I 
did not change it in the deal because we were calcing, and I want to check 
with Diana first before doing it.

What I show in Scheduling is a sale to Smurfit for 40 mw flat, which is what 
is actually scheduled
