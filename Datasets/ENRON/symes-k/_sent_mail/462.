This is a problem I've been working on with IT. They released a new version 
of deal entry, and for some reason certain EOL trades are automatically 
populating all of the new fields, including Schedule Type. I've got Dave 
Poston working on this, and I'll let you know when we've fixed it so you can 
save your part.

Thanks,
Kate
