Here's the procedure for adding new traders to the system. I've requested to 
have Paul Choi's name added - Greg Wolfe and the rest of the mid-marketers 
appear to already be in there.

Hello Kate,

In order for Power Traders to gain access to Power Desks, my team, 
GCP_Houston, must link their names to each Desk.
(Basically, we need a list of desks that the Traders need access.)

Please provide the following info:

Example(s): 

Add these Power Trader(s) to the following Desks: Paul Choi, Greg Wolfe

CP/ID 66189 (not required, but helpful)    EPMI Short Term West Hourly
CP/ID 56849  "    EPMI Long Term West Management

Please submit your request(s) to GCP_Houston, (this is my entire team).

Best Rgds.

Subject: New Trader IDs

The Portland West Desk needs two new traders added to EnPower. I believe 
you're the correct person to contact for this, but please let me know if I 
should talk to somebody else. We'd like to have our mid-marketers enter their 
own trades now, and many of them already have the IDs to do that. Two 
marketers - Paul Choi and Greg Wolfe - do not. I know that when I took over 
the Deal Control position here John Forney contacted you to help me acquire a 
trader ID, so I'm hoping you can help me with this task.

Thank you,
Kate
