You are clearly the quintessential malapropist. I won't even try to compete 
in that category. Especially not at the end of a long day. Of staring. At 
this computer screen. And studying tiny little. Numbers. This is the source 
of my insanity. This is no question of my money or my life. It's neither. I 
think it's time to partake in some of the mind-numbing activities that office 
workers regularly use to gain the strenth to face another day (running), or 
forget that another day is coming (drinking). I've got at least half an hour 
to decide.....

Kate-
(To be slowly read aloud...orated...vociferized)

It is oblivious to me that your chronomologic attritionabutes are
astoundishing.  Supposably, by measuring our intelliphonics against one
another, we have unrecovered a plethorica of potension.  Congratulations on
your victory. You truly are the epitomount of unrequenched passion when it
comes to academica and the pursuant of bettermentality.
Dave
