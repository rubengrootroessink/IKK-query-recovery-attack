That's funny, because that's the guy who Mike Swerzbin and Matt Motley told 
me agreed to ADP the deal. I just gave him a call, but no answer. I'll try 
back in a bit, but I think we should be fine considering Mark Watts 
supposedly already agreed.

Thanks a lot,
Kate

Hi Kate, the person at Southern that called Joe Hunter is Mark Watts.  His 
phone number is (678) 579-3470.  He may be a trader.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks,
Melissa
