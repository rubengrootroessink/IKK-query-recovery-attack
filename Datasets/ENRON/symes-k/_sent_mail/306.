Bob's at lunch right now - I've left a big note on his desk and we'll sort it 
out this afternoon. Thanks for the reminder.

Hello, I hate to bug you with this.  Whenever you can spare a second would 
you ask Bob about this?  I am afraid it is going to slip through the cracks.

Thanks for your help!
Melissa

Hi Bob, I was wondering if you have contacted Constellation about the 6 
trades that are in the system with the Cal Px as the index price.  All of 
these trades start flowing in July of this year.

The deal numbers are as follows:

453152.01
453175.01
453294.01
462109.01
471888.01
471889.01

Let me know if Constellation agrees to change these deals to the Dow Jones so 
I can send a letter for them to sign.

Thanks,
Melissa
