Sean has fixed these - the computer picked up the off peak indices for the 
related deals - #465720 and #465723.

By the way, all our traders are inputting their deals now. I know you guys 
are checking out with brokers - we'll try to expedite the process.

Thanks,
Kate

Kate, I think these two deals of Sean were entered twice for Sun and Holidays 
0100 to 2400.

Could you check on.
