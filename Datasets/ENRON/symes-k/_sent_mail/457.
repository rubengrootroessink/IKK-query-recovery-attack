Another trivial counterparty name change - it's Enmax Energy Corp., not just 
plain old Enmax Corp. These deals have been changed.

Thanks,

540039, 541695, 541715, and 541737 are booked to Enmax Corporation.  I think 
they should be booked to Enmax Energy Corporation.  Wendy Conwell in credit 
has prepared a credit work sheet on this CP so I believe this is the correct 
entity.  Can you check?
