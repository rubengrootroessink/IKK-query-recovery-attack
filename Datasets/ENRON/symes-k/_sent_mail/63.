Thought you guys might like to know that our voice mail system is down until 
later this afternoon. Also, I'm filling in for one of the California 
Schedulers who'll be out of the office for an indefinite period. Please reach 
me on this extension until further notice (yours and mine!): 

(503) 464-3827

Or, if it's an emergency and you can't seem to make it out of the tangled web 
of receptionists and other phone-answerers, call my cell phone at (503) 
819-2181. And of course, there's always e-mail.

I apologize for the confusion and for any inconvenience this may cause. 
Thanks for bearing with us!

Kate
