508957 - changed offset from -1.5 to -1 on 2/6 per Stephanie Piwetz (verbal 
Mirant checkout)

All the rest of the deals I entered for Mike Swerzbin yesterday in my deal 
blotter, which defaults to Short Term California. I noticed immediately after 
saving the deals that they were under the wrong desk, and changed them to 
Long Term Northwest in deal entry. Are there other problems with the deals? 
The only change should be the desk. Please let me know.

Thanks,
Kate

It looks like you made quite a few changes to some deals and I don't see 
anything in the comment section.  Can you just take a quick look and see if 
you know what you changed on any of these.  If not, I can look it up in the 
audit viewer, but it makes things go a lot quicker if we don't have to go 
into the audit viewer for each deal.

Thanks!
