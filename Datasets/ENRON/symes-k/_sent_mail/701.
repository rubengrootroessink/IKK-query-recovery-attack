Issue 1 - Mike Swerzbin
Missing deal = 524266 (Enron buys EES - 25 mw - off peak - Mid C - Q3'01 - 
price is $285.95)
 Mike Driscoll just spoke with Amerex broker, who confirmed he wanted the 
five-cent fee on a different deal (524247), not this one. Our price is right.

Issue 2 - Mike Swerzbin
Mike agreed to 50 mw, but if we change this deal we have to change the other 
side - therefore, 524267 and 524266 will both be changed to 50 mw.

Issue 3 - Diana Scholtes
This is the first I think I've heard about 523984 - I'm sorry if I overlooked 
it. Diana says it's $345 - it's been changed.

Let me know if this resolves everything.

Kate

Let's start over: 


ISSUE 1-Mike Swerzbin
deal 524248 and deal 524266
This two deals checkout with Amerex fine.  Amerex has one deal at 50 mw and 
we have two identical deals at 25 mw.

deal 524247
This deal checks out with Amerex fine.

The deal that I am missing is Enron buys from EES 25 mw of off-peak Mid-C for 
Q3'01 at $285.95.


ISSUE 2- Mike Swerzbin
deal 524267
 Amerex has 50 mw and we have 25 mw.

ISSUE 3- Dianna Scholtes
deal 523984
Amerex has price as $345 and we have price as $335.


This has been a terrible ordeal and I will be so glad when everthing is 
resolved!!!

Thanks
Evelyn
