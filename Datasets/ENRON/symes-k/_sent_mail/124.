582324 - Grays Harbor Paper Mill 
582322 - Las Vegas Cogeneration

I've added the unit names to the deals and reminded Les that they need to be 
in the comments section. He was under the impression that the guideline sheet 
he sent out re: unit names spelled out the answers, but I took another look 
at it and it doesn't seem to really answer anything. I've attached it just in 
case you don't have it anymore - but please let me know if this assists you 
guys in ANY way. If it doesn't, I can probably get him to draw up something 
more useful.

Thanks,
Kate
