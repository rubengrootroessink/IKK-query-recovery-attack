She didn't "warn" me that you were cheesy, but she did mention you were a 
peach too! And anyway, I love cheesy e-mails.

But since I'm writing, I might as well mention that I have a deal that was 
changed last night by one of our traders, and I think it needs to be 
re-confirmed. It's deal number 476435 - Mark Fischer caught his own error and 
changed the delivery point from Palo Verde to Mid-C. 

And speaking of confirms and all that good stuff, that's one area I was never 
really told about; so if you or anyone else in your group has any information 
to share - anything that I could do to make your jobs easier or to make our 
jobs synchronize better - PLEASE let me know. I'm very humble about how much 
I have to learn, so the more people teach me, the better.

I believe I'll be coming down to Houston after the new year to meet people, 
tour the place, and get a suntan! So if you don't want to call or e-mail with 
every detail, you can compile them all and give me the run-down when I'm 
there. Whatever works for you guys - just let me know.

Thanks a lot,
Kate
