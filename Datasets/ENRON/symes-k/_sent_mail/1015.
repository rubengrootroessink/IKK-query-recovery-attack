Chris entered this deal thinking that one was missing from a few days 
earlier. He then realized that the deal was already in, and zeroed this one 
out (instead of just killing it - sometimes those guys are in a big hurry!) 
So I'm going to go ahead and kill the deal, thus eliminating the need to 
change these other details. Does that make sense? Sorry for the confusion.

By the way, how were the holidays for all of you gals down in Texas? I spent 
mine on the beach with a Pina Colada in Mexico, and believe it or not, I'm 
actually glad to be back at work. I was beginning to feel worthless, not to 
mention sunburned. Although any minute now I'm going to be ready for my 
noontime siesta!

Kate

Hi Kate,
This deal needs to be changed to no confirm (it's a West daily deal).  Also, 
it has an NP-15 delivery point with firm energy.
Thanks!
Kim
