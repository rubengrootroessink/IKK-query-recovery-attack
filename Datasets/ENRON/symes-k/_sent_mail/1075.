How many times will I have to remind them? Mike Driscoll added comments on 
both these deals - they would definitely like the special language added in 
the confirm letter.

Thanks,
Kate

Subject: CAISO deals past April '02

Hi Kate!
I have two deals that extent past April 2002 (Deal #478879 & #478878).  The 
traders didn't enter any comments about special CAISO language to be 
entered.  Will you ask them if they want us to enter that language?
Thanks!
Kim
