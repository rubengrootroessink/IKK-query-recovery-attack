Jeff has both sides of both deals in the system correctly. Here are the deal 
numbers.

461029
Williams
115.00

461030
EES
114.95

461801
Mieco
115.00

461802
EES
114.95

And Deal #461139 was actually a Short Term Southwest deal done by Tom Alonso 
with Williams for the same price on the same days, but with Prebon. 
Confusion! 

Hope this fixes it.
