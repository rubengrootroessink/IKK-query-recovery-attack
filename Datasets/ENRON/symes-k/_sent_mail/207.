I'm sorry my response has been such a long time coming on this issue, but 
I've visited with almost every department in our office trying to figure out 
what happened to this deal. Basically, Idaho got their scheduled cut by the 
Cal-ISO, which in turn means we have to cut our schedule flowing to Idaho. So 
Jeremy Morris, one of our California schedulers, cut the first Idaho deal he 
found and passed the remainder of the schedule to Real Time to fill, which 
they did in a separate deal. So EPMI and Idaho are in agreement that the 
schedule got cut, but that we kept them whole by selling the remainder to 
Idaho in the hour-ahead market. 

Now the question is, how do we confirm the deal? From your side, is it better 
if we leave the deal as-is, or restore it to the original 25 mw off peak and 
kill the real time deal (which wouldn't really be an accurate representation 
of what happened)? Just let me know, and we'll do what we can to help.

Thanks,
Kate
