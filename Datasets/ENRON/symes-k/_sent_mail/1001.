Whew! I've been battling with this thing all day and it's gotten me nowhere. 
The version of  EOL Deal Report I've been using for the past month, and which 
Carla used for several months prior to that, has come down with the winter 
blues and will no longer produce anything. Here is the error message it gives 
me:

Cannot create file c:\eolJF.txt.

It responds this way no matter what combination of requests I give it. One 
interesting detail is that it began doing this on 12/21, the night before I 
left for vacation (thus my delay in dealing with this problem), and on that 
same night I noticed that the report looked different than usual. Actually, 
it looked exactly like the stage version that Nadine and I worked with today. 
It had the new section at the bottom titled "Uncheck 'Desk Summary Only' to 
enable"; whereas the version I had been using did not.

Our IT guys deferred to you on this subject, so I'm still at a loss as to how 
to test the new stage version of the EOL report, as I have nothing to test it 
against. My feeling is that, even though the new version has a few quirks, it 
would be better than nothing and so should be put into production - because 
in the meantime I'm going to have to use it anyway - it's all I have now!

Thank you so much for your support on this so far. Hopefully we can work 
something out tomorrow.

Thanks,
Kate
