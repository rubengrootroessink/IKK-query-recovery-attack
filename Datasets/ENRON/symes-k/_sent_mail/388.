Mark - I believe our Real Time group is sending your group a spreadsheet 
outlining all of the trades they do on behalf of EES each day. The first two 
deals - 544537 and 544544 - should be included in that sheet. The only deals 
recorded in the sheet I send are fixed price (and sometimes Dow Jones 
index-forward) day-ahead trades done by the EPMI Short Term California desk.

The third deal - 553219 - is in EnPower at the correct price of $133.23. The 
worksheet price was not updated from the day before, but it's been corrected.

The fourth deal - 553219 - again is a Real Time deal. It looks like it was 
entered on 3/19 for 3/19 HE 1. It's a deal for 25 MW, not 150 MW, at $175.00. 
I'm not quite sure why EES thinks this deal should be in for HE 1-6 on 3/16. 
If you have any more information, please send that along to Bill Williams III 
and me.

I hope this helps. Let me know if you have anymore questions.

Thanks,
Kate
