I'm not sure if someone else got to this before I did, but I see the same end 
date at the top and bottom of this deal - 6/30/01. Let me know if this needs 
to be changed, or if it's not showing up correctly for you. 

Thanks,
Kate

Hi Kate,
Please have a look at the term on this deal.  There is a discrepancy between 
the end date at the top of the screen in Deal Entry and the one listed in the 
strips at the bottom.  Is the correct end date 6/30 or 6/1? 
Thanks!
Kim
