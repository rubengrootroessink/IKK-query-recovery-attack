I have changed the following deals to reflect a monthly expiry frequency 
instead of daily:

483753
483759
483765
483766

Since I don't enter options very often, and have only done daily options 
before, I'm still getting familiar with all the different parameters of the 
deals. I'm sorry for the confusion. Thanks for catching that.
