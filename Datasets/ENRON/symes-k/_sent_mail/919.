Re: the BPA deals - Sean Crandall said for pricing purposes it doesn't matter 
whether the delivery point is in as Mid-C or NW delivered. The only reason he 
entered NW delivered is because there was transmission involved. For your 
purposes, Sean said it's fine to change the delivery point to Mid-C (NW 
Delivered) in the confirms, but he didn't want to have it changed in EnPower 
because that would mess with the routing.

Does that make any sense? Let me know if you need it changed in EnPower, and 
I'll talk to Sean.

Thanks,
Kate

Kate, I have a couple of confirms I received from BPA with the following 
info. I spoke with BPA and they said that their trader had talked to Sean 
Crandall and agreed to Mid Columbia as the Delivery point, however in the 
Enpower they have Northwest Delivered. Could you please check into:

#492613.01, 492612.01, 492611.01, 488524.01, 488523.01 These all say NW in 
the system but BPA has Mid C on confirm

#491609.01 This trade has a trade date of 1/8/01. But on BPA's confirm they 
have a trade date of 1/5/01. Could you ask Mike who did the trade which is 
correct?

Thanks,

Kimberly
