Thanks for keeping me up to date. Out of curiosity, do you know why El Paso 
changed the trade date in the first place?

Kate

Kate, 
just fyi, El Paso struck thru our 12/6/00 trade date and placed 12/5/00.  I 
spoke to Chi, of El Paso and he said the 12/6/00 was okay.  I just made a 
note on the confirm and sending it to the fileroom to be executed.
Thanks
Stephanie
