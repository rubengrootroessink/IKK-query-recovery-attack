Chris looked these over and we agreed to just re-send the original 
confirmation letter, because the ISO may make cuts again - in fact, the 
revised confirm is no longer correct. I put a comment in the deal instructing 
no revised confirms to be sent, per Chris Foster.

Also, Chris noticed that the counterparty contact name in the letters was 
incorrect. The new contact at ARCO is Alicia Izarraraz. Her number is (562) 
499-3234. I hope this helps.

Thanks,
Kate

This is the original confirmation letter we sent out.



Unfortunately, before I found out anything about all this, I sent out a 
revised confirmation when the deal was changed and went into a pending 
status.  This is the revised confirmation letter that went out.



These are the only two that have been sent to the counterparty.  I have put a 
note into the TAGG system that should let us know not to send another revised 
confirmation.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks for the phone list.  Kimberly Hundl is soooo jealous!
