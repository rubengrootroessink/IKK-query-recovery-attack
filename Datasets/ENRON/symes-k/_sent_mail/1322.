Just to clarify - you are booked in the Mt. Bachelor conference room for your 
Monday morning staff meetings, 9 to 10:15 a.m., from now until this time next 
year. Hopefully this will eliminate any last minute confusion like what we 
ran into this morning. If you have any other questions, please let Mollie or 
myself know and we'll address them as quickly as possible.

Thank you - 
Kate Symes
West Origination Clerk
