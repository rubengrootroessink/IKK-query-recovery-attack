I've changed all the deals I could find that contained the counterparty name 
"California Department of Water Resources - CDWR" to "California Energy 
Resource Schedulers - State of California." The following deal numbers are 
those that have been changed. If you come across other daily deals, most 
likely done by EPMI Short Term California or Short Term Northwest, let me 
know and I'll change those counterparty names too.

Thanks for your help on this.
