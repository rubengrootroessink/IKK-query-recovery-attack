I'm dragging myself out of this office. I can hardly keep my eyes open, but 
it's well-deserved. Santana concert last night with friends from Ashland. The 
social schedule just never lets up. I don't know how feasible it would be for 
me to spend two months resisting the temptations of hand-holding boys and 
shadowy bars. But I will think seriously about the idea. Have a safe trip 
back home. Oh, and my Christmas plans still stand - gone from Dec. 22 to Jan. 
2. Maybe it's you who needs a schedule rearrangement.
