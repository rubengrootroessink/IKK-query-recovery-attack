Just wanted to give you an update on my progress so far - I'm changing these 
deals in between each of my other daily tasks, and I'm also having a hard 
time reading some of the deal numbers. I've made it through the first page 
and a bit of the second. I've changed all but four of the deals to "no 
confirm." Here are the questions I have on those deals:

1. 552516 - why are we not confirming a City of Riverside deal? Should I ask 
Jeff?

2. 553037 - looks like it's already "no confirm"

3. 553666/667/668 - are we not confirming any deals where PGE is the 
counterparty? I thought it was just where PGE System was the delivery point?

4. 553926 - this deal is killed. Do we have to change settings on killed 
deals as well?

Also, if you have a slightly bigger copy of the document you faxed over, or 
if you could e-mail it to me, that would save me a lot of guessing time. 
Thanks for your help!

Kate
