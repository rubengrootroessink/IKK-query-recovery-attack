According to Bob Badeer, these deals were confirmed by Christian Yoder, on of 
our lawyers. I'll check with Christian to see why, and add comments to the 
deals to denote this. Let me know if there's anything else I can do.

Thanks,
Kate

Subject: Avista deals

There are two deals for Avista the are marked not to be confirmed.  Can you 
check into these, and if they are not to be confirmed, put a little note as 
to why or who said not to confirm them, so 6 months from now when someone 
says "Why didn't you confirm this deal!"  I'll have something to jog my 
memory.  (Because I will have slept between now and then!)

Deal Numbers #487050 and 487054

Thanks!
