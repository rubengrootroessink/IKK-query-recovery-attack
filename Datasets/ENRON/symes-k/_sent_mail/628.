Subject: Deal No. 532726

As you know, we do not have a contract with Transalta Energy Marketing Corp. 
but with Transalta Energy Marketing (US) Inc.  I am changing this deal to 
that CP.  

Let me know if you have any objections or if you prefer to make the change 
yourself.  Do you want me to continue to let you know of these changes?  I 
know Carla preferred to make the changes herself.
