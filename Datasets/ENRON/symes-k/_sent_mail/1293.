Just in case you're checking your e-mail in between spa sessions, here's an 
update:

The BPA Business Plan has not yet arrived.
Sir Speedy just arrived with copies of the EIS, which were supposed to be 
finished at noon.

So I'm a little frustrated with this lack of efficiency. I've left a message 
at BPA regarding the whereabouts of our order; I've scolded Sir Speedy for 
the delay; and one way or another I'll get the documents out to Terrell Gault 
and Jim Fell tomorrow.

I'm sure the last thing you want to hear while you're escaping from it all is 
that things aren't going according to planned back in the office; but I 
thought you should know just in case you hear from either of these guys. 
Nothing to worry about, though. You can now resume your poolside position.

Kate
