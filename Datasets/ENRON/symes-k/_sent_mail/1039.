Here's the solution I came up with. It will only take a few more minutes each 
day, but I think it will make the EOL summary more relevant. Please let me 
know if this plan suits you - 

1. You will continue to receive the same EnPower/EOL summary, complete with 
EES sleeves. If I take the EES deals out of this table, I have to adjust the 
total megawatts accordingly. This could end up taking awhile, and I'm not 
sure the effect would be worth it. Again, let me know if you agree, because 
I'd like this report to be as applicable as possible.

2. I will run the EnPower deal count, excluding EES deals. I'll compare this 
count to the original one to determine how many EES deals were done by each 
desk, then double that number - to account for both sides of the sleeve - and 
subtract. I'll enter the altered numbers into the graph, which should produce 
a more accurate rendering of the day's activities.

I think I made it sound more complicated than it is. Bottom line, this should 
solve the EES sleeve dilemma with little ado.
