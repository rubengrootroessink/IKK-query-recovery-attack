You're right - thanks for checking up on us. This deal was actually done this 
morning before Credit came out with the updated watchlist. He checked with 
Tracy Ngo, our credit person, on the deal and she's aware of and okay with 
it. I guess Bob snuck one in there!

Thanks,
kate

This is a deal with Mieco and I thought they were cut off.

Thanks!
