1. 468359 is Mike Swerzbin's deal. He entered it incorrectly in his log. It's 
changed now.

2. 468404 and 468405 - Bob Badeer was given the wrong numbers by Amerex. He's 
changed the deals to reflect Amerex numbers.

3. 468302 is Donald Robinson's deal. I'm tracking him down right now to check 
on the term.

4. 468427 is $177, not $197. Jeff has really bad handwriting. I'll change 
this as soon as the calc is done (about 30 min.).

5. I've left Jeff a message - he's at an off-site meeting today and is 
probably giving a speech right now.l I don't see these deals in his trade 
log, so I really need to talk with him in order to find out whether or not he 
did them and where they might be.

Thanks,
Kate
