I'm working on a phone list for some of the people I work with in the Houston 
office - kind of a modified version of ours. But I just noticed that my 
information on the floor card has changed since the last printing. Debra said 
I should forward the information on to you for use in the next floor card. 
Here it is:

Ext. 7486
Cell phone 819-2181

And actually, my home phone will change too at the end of this week. I'll 
send that along when I get it. I know this isn't pressing information, but I 
figured I'd let you know before I forgot.

Thanks,
Kate
