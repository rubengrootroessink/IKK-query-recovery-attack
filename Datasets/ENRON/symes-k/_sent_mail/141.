I asked Bob about these this morning, and he said he's still got to work this 
out with Constellation. The way he explained it, our position is flat with 
Constellation, so for settlements purposes we're okay - i.e. We've bought the 
same volumes that we've sold, and we end up losing a bit due to the index 
offset - but otherwise the index price won't make a difference.  But I 
suspect he's not thinking of the problem from the confirmation standpoint. 
Could you tell me exactly what needs to happen to clear this up on your end 
so that I can explain it to Bob in a way that might make him DO something? 
I'm sorry for the delay on this - I'm getting ready to call Bob's contact at 
Constellation for him.

Let me know what your ideal solution would be. Should we get Constellation to 
agree to the Dow Jones index? Or should we change the deals to forward fixed 
price? We'll fix this today - I promise.

Thanks,
Kate

I just talked to Bob, and I don't know if he's responded yet, but I thought 
I'd fill you in anyway. He's been talking to his contact at Constellation 
about changing these deals over, but hasn't received a concrete answer yet. 
I've reminded him and he said he WILL talk to the guy and resolve it today. 
I'll keep on it, and let you know when these deals have been changed.

Thanks,
Kate

Hello, I hate to bug you with this.  Whenever you can spare a second would 
you ask Bob about this?  I am afraid it is going to slip through the cracks.

Thanks for your help!

Hi Bob, I was wondering if you have contacted Constellation about the 6 
trades that are in the system with the Cal Px as the index price.  All of 
these trades start flowing in July of this year.

The deal numbers are as follows:

453152.01
453175.01
453294.01
462109.01
471888.01
471889.01

Let me know if Constellation agrees to change these deals to the Dow Jones so 
I can send a letter for them to sign.

Thanks,
Melissa
