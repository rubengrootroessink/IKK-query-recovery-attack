Kevin actually sent an e-mail to Melissa Ann Murphy regarding this deal, so 
if you need more information, she'd probably be the one to go to. 

Thanks,
Kate

Hi Kate,
I need to get a contact name and phone number for this counterparty so that I 
can get a verbal confirm on this deal.  Please see if John can give you this 
information.  Have a lovely day!
Thanks!
