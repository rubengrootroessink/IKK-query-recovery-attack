Bob talked with TFS this morning and has the deals in his trade log now. I'll 
get the deal numbers from him as soon as he inputs them, but you should see 
those trades in the system soon.

Thanks,
Kate

Bob does not recognize these deals, and tried to check with the broker. He'll 
talk to TFS in the morning to verify these and I'll let you know ASAP.

Thanks,
Kate
