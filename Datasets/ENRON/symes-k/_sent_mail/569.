When you guys do loss return deals like this one with PGE, could you include 
a note in the comments section regarding the zero price and "no confirm" 
status? The Confirms group in Houston has requested some kind of comment in 
these deals so they don't try to track down a price or confirm the deal.

Thanks,
Kate
