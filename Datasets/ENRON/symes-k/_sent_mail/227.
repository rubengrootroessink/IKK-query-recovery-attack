Yep - the trade's there all right. I just talked to Mike again and he said 
he'd love to take the trade, but he's sure it's an error. To avoid any 
confusion later, and because he's already left the office for today, let's 
have Mike talk to his Amerex broker tomorrow morning and clear this up. He 
just might get a sweet deal out of it!

Mike did a deal with these terms but a price of 380 - deal is #571917. But he 
said a price like $292.50 doesn't sound right for Sept. - possibly May?
