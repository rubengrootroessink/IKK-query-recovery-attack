I know - it's amazing that in this age of technological wizardry we are 
forced to resort to some of the cheesiest hijinks known to man. Of course, if 
I was one of those technological wizards, I'd just come up with my own e-mail 
birthday greeting, and it would KICK ASS! Anyway, just to take even more of 
the fun out of your birthday, I thought I'd just go ahead and let you know 
what I'm getting you: money. Of course. I'm actually paying you back the $200 
I still owe you, and kicking in an extra $50. How's that sound? It should 
reach you by next Thursday (when I get paid), so you can plan you're life 
around it's arrival accordingly. Would it be easier for you to cash a check 
or a money order? I think cash in the mail is a little too risky. I can also 
use that money to buy you something, get you a Safeway gift certificate, 
c.d.'s, etc., if you'd rather. Let me know what you're preference is - this 
bank is willing to work with any customer requests. Hope your birthday rocks. 
I'm sorry I couldn't be there to celebrate (read: get insanely inebriated) 
with you, and that I couldn't contribute to the birthday fund sooner. 

Love,
Kate
