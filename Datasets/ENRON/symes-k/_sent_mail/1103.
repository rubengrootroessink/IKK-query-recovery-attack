In regard to the special delivery point language for April-02 and beyond: 
Please use me as a liasion between the Portland traders and yourselves to 
ensure these deals get entered correctly. The traders are aware that they 
need to specify whether or not they'd like the counterparty to see this 
special language; however, if deals get through to the Confirms department 
without specification in the comments section, I'd like to be notified. In 
this way, we can resolve the matter quickly and efficiently and hopefully 
avoid a larger problem down the road. 

Thanks for your help on this.

Kate
