Well, to tell you the truth, it sucks right now. Work has been snowballing 
with all kinds of unimaginable computer problems, so many that I've basically 
forgotten what they all are now. And on top of that, runner guy stopped by 
last night and it happened to be the last day of Amber's finals so she and 
Molly had been drinking since 2 p.m. Well, I'm not quite sure if that scared 
him away, but we were supposed to go to a movie tonight - he asked me, I 
accepted, we had a time picked out - now I NEVER make plans as a rule, but 
this was a goddamn plan. So he calls 15 minutes ago and actually CANCELS. Not 
even just that, he doesn't give a REASON. I am so livid right now there's 
smoke coming out of my ears. I need to go finish work so I can get out of 
here and go bomb his car. I'll call you tonight.

Kate

hey poopstain,

What's up?  I am sooooo good.  Dad and my car will be here on Monday, isn't
that great?  I just want to drive for the rest of my life!  So I get three
days off next week, plus I'm leaving for my outward bound course next
friday.  So basically I have like a week vacation!  Things are still going
with the cute waiter (Nathan), but I've discovered a flaw.  It was only a
matter of time, you know.  Actually, it's a non-fatal flaw, it's annoying at
worst.  Basically, he carries his cell phone everywhere and answers and
talks on it in all types of situations, such as the video store, a taxi cab,
and while eating dinner with his friends.  I just can't stand those things.
It's one thing to chat on it when you're walking down the street by yourself
or in your car by yourself, but when you're with other people or in the
checkout line at the video store and there are people waiting for you, I
just think it's so rude.  But I'm going to try to get over it, because
otherwise he's great, and I seem to be the only person on God's green earth
who has not caught onto the whole cell phone craze.  So that's my life,
what's going on in yours?

love, anna
