Sharen had already alerted me to the first deal, which I changed, but not the 
second. That deal has been changed as well now.

Thanks,
Kate

Subject: Jeff Richter Index Deals-error


Hi Kate,

I spoke with Jeff Richter this morning and the index sleeve he did on 
yesterday with EES (deal 533084) and Sempra(deal 533085) is incorrect in 
Enpower.  He said he would change the publication code to reflect Dow Jones 
SP-15 Peak instead of Dow Jones NP-15 Peak on both of these deals.

Can you please check with Jeff to see what the status is on these changes. 
The EES deal has been changed. The Sempra deal has not been changed.

Thanks!!
