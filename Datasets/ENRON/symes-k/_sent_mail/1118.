How did I turn around and suddenly find myself in December? Why is there a 
man parked outside my office incessantly tooting "Jingle Bell Rock" on his 
horn? When will I ever see my bare feet again? How annoying is it that I 
began this e-mail with lines of whining?

I hope the holidays are at least a somewhat more sincere experience in 
Vietnam than they are here. I guess I don't remember this kind of chaos in 
years past, but then I'm spending a lot more time in the commercial center of 
the city these days. Which, by the way, is going very well. I'm just getting 
to the level of familiarity with my new job that allows me time for pointless 
e-mails. It's been a steep learning curve, and I still have a long way to go, 
but that's what makes everyday interesting.

Other than work, I haven't had time for a whole lot. Thanksgiving was nice - 
saw a lot of friends from out of town and had enough meals with the family to 
satisfy, but not overwhelm, the quality time scale. Our office had its big 
holiday bash last weekend, which I kicked off the night before for no 
apparent reason and just continued the festivities for about 48 nonstop 
hours. There's snow on the mountain, so this weekend I might have to break in 
(or break, whichever comes first) my new snowboard.

Hope all's well on the other side of the world. It's kind of comforting to 
remind myself every once in awhile that there is another side, full of people 
who could care less about power trading and Portland, Oregon. By the way, I 
heard through the grapevine that Clinton was quite a hand-full. Good or bad? 
Or ugly?

Shoot me an e-mail when and if you get a chance. I'm out of here on the 22nd, 
and it will be so nice to see the sun again. If I don't see you, have a great 
vacation, and try not to be overwhelmed by the joyousness of the season.

Kate
