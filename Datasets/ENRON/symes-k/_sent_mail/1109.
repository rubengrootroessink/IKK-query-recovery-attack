Yes, Mike would like special language included in this deal's confirm letter. 
I spoke with him and a couple of the other traders, who said that they were 
aware of the change coming in April-02, but weren't aware they needed to 
enter comments in the deal. I'm sending an e-mail out to all of them to 
remind everyone to enter comments in deals that go past April-02 if they want 
special language.

Please let me know if there's anything else I can do.

Thanks,
Kate

This deal with Colorado River Commission is for calendar 2002.  We were told 
that we may need to enter special CAISO language for deals that extent past 
April 2002, but that the traders should be entering comments to indicate 
this.  Does Mike want us to include this language in the confirm letter for 
this deal?
Thanks for your help!
Kim
