Disregard my other reply - I don't know what I was thinking. Prebon was right 
on this. Both deals were 50 MW (not 25 MW like I said earlier!), and they 
were changed accordingly.

Sorry about the confusion.

Traded 11-13-00 Chris mallory
deal 457482 and 457481
Prebon shows 50 mw and we show 25 mw on each deal.
Can you check with Chris Mallory because when I checked out with Prebon we 
confirmed the megawatts as 25mw on these deals.

Thanks
