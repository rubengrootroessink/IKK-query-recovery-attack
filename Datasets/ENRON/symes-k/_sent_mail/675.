So didya hear the Blazers creamed the Nuggets last night? I always knew the 
Pacific Northwest would dominate in sports - they're not battling with that 
ol' Rocky Mountain High if ya know what I mean.

Well I'm sorry I didn't get back to you yesterday - work was hectic and I 
knew that if I started an e-mail to you it would either be half-assed or I'd 
never finish it. Well, I'm going for the former now, because I realized there 
would never be a good time to divulge the full and sordid details of what's 
happening around here, and all the while I wait, more and more important 
nuggets (get it!) of gossip are accumulating.

So it's quite appropriate that you wrote yesterday with roommate issues - 
mine could not be worse. Amber took off for the "library" on Thursday night 
and came home.....four days later. After Molly and I had a mild freak-out 
session on Friday - which included calling everybody she's every known, 
including Chris and the police - we heard through the grapevine that Marky 
McCulloch, of Neidermeyer cousin fame, was in town from none other than 
Denver and the two were having a secret and James-Bond-like rendezvous at the 
beach. Well that was all well and fine, other than the fact that she DIDN'T 
TELL US SHE WAS LEAVING and we had been planning a housewarming party this 
weekend for the past month and she DIDN'T TELL US SHE WAS LEAVING and she 
moved kitty into the house but still hasn't told our landlords or paid the 
$500 deposit, oh, and also, SHE DIDN'T TELL US SHE WAS LEAVING. So many 
things were wrong and bizarre about that, but none more than her attitude 
when she walked in the door Monday afternoon. Let's just say I spared no lung 
muscles in telling her exactly what I thought about her selfish, childish, 
idiotic, and most importantly, psychotically self-important behavior. She had 
the gall to defensively scream back that she didn't tell us BECAUSE SHE 
DIDN'T WANT TO LIE. Hmmmm. Not only did she not want to lie - how sweet - but 
she couldn't have told us because Molly and I have suddenly developed an 
insatiable urge to spread fervent and widespread rumors about Amber's love 
trysts. Now, I KNOW there's nothing I'd rather be doing.

Anyway, enough of that. She and I have reached an understanding that just 
because we're roommates does not mean we have to be friends. We've never been 
good at that anyhow. In other news, we had an amazing housewarming party. I 
really wish you could have been there. Molly and I didn't know 90 percent of 
the people there, which is a good thing because it meant they were all 
interesting, successful, gracious and cute. I think there were about four 
girls there - you could tell who planned the party. Sadly, no love 
connections were made that evening, but I've decided that's my new M.O. - 
keep 'em guessing. My friend Michael from Maui who now lives in Seattle came 
down with his friend Jordan who happens to be hot and writing an article for 
Food & Wine magazine. Very interesting guy, but potentially in the closet, so 
I'm keeping my distance. But they invited me up to Seattle next weekend for a 
five-course meal and $100 bottles of wine at some Microsoft dude's mansion. 
Definitely sounds like my crowd. Should I wear my dirty jeans or my clean 
jeans?

I've got my eye on flights to Denver, but right now it's looking like the end 
of March before I can scrape up that kind of cash. Amber on the other hand 
will be there five times before that because some psycho over there keeps 
buying her tickets. That's fair for ya.

Okay, that's all I can do for now, but call me tonight and we'll do the rumor 
mill justice. Take care and hang in there - we'll be booting a roommate soon 
if you feel like coming back to Portland.
