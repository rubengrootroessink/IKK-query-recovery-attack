Prebon is right on this. Both deals are 25 MW. They've been changed.

Thanks,

Traded 11-13-00 Chris mallory
deal 457482 and 457481
Prebon shows 50 mw and we show 25 mw on each deal.
Can you check with Chris Mallory because when I checked out with Prebon we 
confirmed the megawatts as 25mw on these deals.

Thanks
