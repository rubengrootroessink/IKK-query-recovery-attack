I've forwarded this e-mail onto Diana and asked her to let you or me know 
what the status is on these confirm letters. We'll be in touch.

Thanks and yes, we will need copies of the letters.  If she could send us the 
same copy she sends to the counterparty, then we can put it into our files 
and we won't have to call her repeatedly when we are trying to get a signed 
copy from the counterparty for the files.

thanks!

Diana just told me that these deals are NOT supposed to be confirmed. She's 
taking care of that. Let me know if you need copies of the letters or if 
you'd like to speak to Diana directly.

Subject: Modesto deals

There are four deals on the no report that look like they sould be 
confirmed.  Can you take a look at them and check to see why they are coded 
not to be confirmed?

I guess you have seen the email that shows what your computer looks like when 
you work in (or apparently near) California?  You open it and the screen 
starts moving around.

Stay well!
