I'm unclear as to what Will found in these deals that needs to be looked at. 
The first one (scary!!) has notes in the comments section of each leg that 
say it was terminated on 9/30/98; however, there are still forward deal legs 
that haven't been killed or zeroed out. I don't think I could consider myself 
a deal control professional on this one - I'll need to talk to a trader. But 
let me know what you want me to look for in the remaining deals. Is this part 
of the time zone glitch?
