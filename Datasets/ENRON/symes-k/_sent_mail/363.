I'm a little confused - 559066 is a Prebon deal under Mike Swerzbin's book. 
559091 is a Bloomberg deal under Matt Motley's book. I just talked to Mike 
Driscoll and he said these both have the correct brokers on them and there 
were two deals. ????

Kate deal 559066 is identical to deal 559091.  Prebon does not recognize 
559066.  Were these duplicates?

BLOOMBERG
Matt Motley
559091 - sells to Idaho, 50 mw, April, Mid-C, $358

Tom Alonso
559010 - price is changed to $160
He is still entering last two deals.

AMEREX
Mike Swerzbin
559062 - buys AEP, 25 mw, Cal-02, PV, $140
And Tom said he didn't have anything to do with this deal - Mike said MW were 
correct.


Thanks,
kate
