My oh my - it's a rare occasion when I am greeted by such entertaining 
e-mails in the morning. Thanks for dropping the note, even if it was just a 
covert ploy to get me to deprive your enemies of their electricity. And by 
the way, if I could do that, you can bet we would have already had rolling 
black-outs in strategically placed Portland neighborhoods.

Yes, I did finish the book. It was very interesting, although it did lose me 
for awhile in the middle. It's a super-fast read, so I'm going to send 
another book along with it called "Liar's Poker." I just heard about it and 
it's supposed to be hilarious - an account of the boom and doom of Wall 
Street in the 1980s. I know, I know - Corporate America has taken its 
stranglehold on me, and pretty soon I'll be reading the stock market quotes 
for FUN! But just give it a chance; it's something a little different.

No, Anna did not give me the fair chance I deserved to get "Heartbreaking 
Work..." She is clearly a tramp. I will be procuring that book for myself 
later today, as I do not see any time in the near future when Anna will come 
to her senses and quit being evil.

Anyway, I've got to go control the world's electricity supply now. (This 
statement should be followed by a Dr. Evil type cackle; you know, the one 
that comes after "One Meeeelllion Dollars....") But study up and make us all 
proud. Tell all your roomies I said hi, and study....or pay the price later.

Kate

P.S. What the heck is your address anyway?
