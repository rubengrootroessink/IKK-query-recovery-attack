I just spoke with Holli Krebs about Grant County this afternoon. She said the 
confirms had already been signed by Tim Belden and gone through one of our 
lawyers, Jan King. Jan told Holli that she had sent the signed confirms down 
to someone in Houston - Holli thought it was you. Apparently Holli got a 
message from both you and me last week while at a WSPP conference, and called 
Jan to tell her to send the confirms out - so Jan sent them AGAIN. So if you 
still haven't seen those confirms come across your desk, then either someone 
else is receiving them or they're going to the wrong fax number. I've left a 
note for Jan King and hopefully we'll talk in the morning so I can find out 
more specifically where she's been sending the confirm letters. Sorry for all 
this confusion. We'll talk tomorrow.

Thanks,
Kate
