This has been changed. And regarding the EES acquisition from the end of last 
year, I spoke with Kim Hundl briefly about it yesterday. I was a little 
unclear about the question in your e-mail to Carla, which was forwarded to 
me. Please give me a call or shoot me an e-mail, and we'll figure this out. 
Tracy Ngo, our Portland credit person, knows all about it, so between us we 
should be able to clarify this.

Thanks,
Kate

This deal has an NP delivery point with firm energy.  Let me know when it is 
corrected.

Thanks!
