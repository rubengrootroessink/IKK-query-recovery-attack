I'm not sure why you're seeing a price of $65.70 come through on this deal, 
but I'm looking at the deal in EnPower right now and I see a price of $65. If 
you could let me know what report is showing the incorrect price, I might be 
able to figure out why.

Thanks,
Kate

Your deal # 581358.1 is showing a price of 65.70 but on the Real Time 
spreadsheet, I see 65.00.  Which is correct?

Thanks for you help

Judy
