I think we ran into this problem before where the California schedulers, for 
whatever reason, didn't pull the .8 Riverside deal into their sheet, and 
therefore I didn't see it or add it to the EES sheet. Let me just check with 
Phil on this to make sure he didn't do it for a reason; then I can amend the 
sheet and re-send it. 

And on the Wed./Thurs. generation volumes - I can only assume that Phil spoke 
with Riverside at some point about the change to .55, but again I need to 
speak with him to verify this. He should be in the office soon, and I'll let 
you know as soon as I find out.

Thanks,
Kate

Hey Kate,

For 4/15 and 4/16, our schedules that we sent you show a Riverside 
Generatioin component of 0.8 every hour (SP15).  This is not reflected in 
your current April update.  The EnPower columns for these days should be 
increased by 0.8 for every hour.  Right?

Also, The generation component that I sent you for Wednesday and Thursday 
(which I sent Monday morning) had a generation component of 0.8.  In reality, 
it was actually 0.55.  I didn't have the generation schedule from Riverside 
and had to assume a value so I assumed it would be 0.8 because that's where 
it had been for a while.  In your current file, you have the correct value of 
0.55.  How did you know this?  Did Riverside call you to tell you they were 
at 0.55 instead of 0.8?  Let me know.  Thanks.

Dan
