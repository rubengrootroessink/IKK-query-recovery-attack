This deal has been changed to MTWTFS, on peak hours. Mike Driscoll's mask in 
Deal Blotter was incorrect.

Thanks,

This deal is entered as 7 - 22, every day of the week.  Usually it is 7 -22, 
M - S or 1 -24, every day of the week.  Can you check into this and let me 
know if it is correct?

Thanks!
