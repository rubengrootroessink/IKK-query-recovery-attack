This deal is the same as all the others Carla Hoffman entered yesterday - in 
the interest of time, she entered all deals with a Saturday-Sunday mask in 
Deal Blotter. If the deals were on peak, she said it shouldn't matter that 
they were marked to flow both days, because Sunday is all off-peak hours. I 
explained this in a couple e-mails yesterday - I guess I got confused about 
who I told. Carla said she's done this before and it shouldn't be a problem. 
Please let me know if you agree with this. In my opinion, just taking the 
time to explain the discrepancy in the 10 or 12 deals that were entered this 
way actually took more time than it saved. What do you think?
