Hello Kate,

I saw  the following deals show up as not to be confirmed, but wanted to 
double check with you to make sure that they should not be confirmed.

They are all Stanley Cocke deals :

564959 Delano
564981 Atlantic Richfield
564983 Sierra Power
564999 Wheelabrator Martell
565001 Whellabrator Shasta


Thanks so much!
Amy
