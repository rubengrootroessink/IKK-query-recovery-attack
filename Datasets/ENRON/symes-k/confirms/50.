Hi Kate!
I got your voice mail this morning (I was out sick yesterday).  I did a 
search based on the info you left in your vmail and got deal #531742.  Is 
this the deal you were looking for?  If so, this confirmation letter has been 
executed by Avista Energy, Inc.  Would you like a faxed copy of this confirm?
