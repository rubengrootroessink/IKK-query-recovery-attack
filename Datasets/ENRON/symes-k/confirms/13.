Hello, now that I have looked at these trades closer it looks like most of 
them are EOL trades.  I don't think your traders did too badly on the 
contacts.

Thanks!
Melissa

Hi Kate, can you please ask all of the traders to add contacts to their 
trades.  Starting today we are confirming west daily trades.  Christian Yoder 
thought it would be a good idea to start confirming these trades.  If you 
look at the attachment below you will see how many deals we will have to open 
up to attach a contact to.  We are going to try to get our IT group to fix 
the system so that the confirm would populate with a default contact whether 
one has been chosen in Enpower or not.  This may take a while for them to do.

Thanks for your help,
Melissa

Hello, if there is anyway for you all to quickly change the deals on the 
following spreadsheet to "yes" on confirmation letter please let me know!



Thanks!
