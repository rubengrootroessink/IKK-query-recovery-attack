Good Morning,

I ran the new report against production, using the shortcut provided for me. 
My results are innacurate because some transmission deals are not showing. 
The strange thing is that there is no real pattern as to why some 
transmission deals show and some don't.

I compared the forward ob to scheduling.   You might want to do that 
comparison for yourself there.  Also, checking the Real-Time position manager 
as well will help.

Please see this power point document.
