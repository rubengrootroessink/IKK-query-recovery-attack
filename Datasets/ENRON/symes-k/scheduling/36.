The changes will also include correcting leg one from Mid C to Montana 
System, and removing  deal 597244  from the system.  I don't know who put 
this in, but they should never be allowed to touch Enpower again!

this deal is a flat deal, but was only put in on one leg as Sundays and 
Holidays.

I have added the 2 other legs to show index Peak and index off peak
