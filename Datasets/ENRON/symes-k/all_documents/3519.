I heard on the radio a couple of days ago they are predicting gas to be
$3.00/gal this summer!!! This just  might  work!

PLEASE NOTE:

I read in the paper yesterday that EXXON posted profits of 12 MILLION
dollars this past Quarter!!!!.  They STOLE that money from us poor suckers
just
as
if they had held us up at gunpoint and ROBBED us!!!!!
Then I get this email -- it makes sense to me: This makes more sense than
the "don't buy gas on a certain day" routine that was going around.
Gasoline Prices!  Whomever started this has a good point.  By now you're
probably thinking gasoline priced at about $1.49 is cheap.  Me too!  As it
is now $1.58 for regular unleaded.  Now that the oil companies and the OPEC
nations have conditioned us to think that the cost of a gallon of gas is
CHEAP at less than $1.50, we need to try an aggressive response. With the
price of gasoline going up more each day, we consumers need to take
action.

The only way we are going to see the price of gas come down is if we don't
buy it.  But, that's not really a practical option since we all have come to
rely on our cars.

But we CAN have an impact on gas prices if we all act together.

HERE'S THE IDEA:
For the rest of this year, don't purchase gasoline from the two biggest
companies (which now are one), EXXON and MOBIL.  If they are not selling,
they should be inclined to reduce their prices-and if they reduce their
prices the other companies will too.  But to have an impact, we need to
reach literally millions of users.  But it's do-able!  I am sending this
note to
30
people.  If each of you send it to at least 10 more ...and those 10 send it
to at least 10 more, and so on by the time the message reaches the sixth
iteration we will have reached over one million consumers. Acting together
we can make a difference.  If this makes sense to you, please pass this
message
on, or one you compose, to at least 10 more E-mail addresses.

PLEASE HOLD OUT UNTIL THEY LOWER THEIR PRICES TO $1.28 -$1.29 AND KEEP
THEM DOWN.  THIS CAN REALLY WORK.
