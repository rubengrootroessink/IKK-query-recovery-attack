Hi Kate, Deal # 509086.01 is still in the system at the PX index instead of 
the Dow Jones SP-15 index.  This trade was done on January 30, 2001.  We just 
received the new index language from Steve Hall in Portland.  I was going to 
confirm this trade but it has the old index.  There is another deal done the 
same day that has been changed (509087) to the new index.  I know some of the 
deals that are not flowing have not been changed because Bob Badeer is still 
negotiating with the counterparties.  Is this one that can be changed since 
it started flowing Feb 1?

Let me know,

Thanks,
Melissa
