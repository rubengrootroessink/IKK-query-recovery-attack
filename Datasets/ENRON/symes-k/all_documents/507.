Hello, I left a message for David Dupre and he has not called me back.  If 
you want to have Matt call Tim Cannon at Sempra that would be fine.  His 
phone number is (203) 355-5190.  I don't know why this has been so 
difficult.  If I hear from David I will let you know.  I want to know how he 
handled these deals in the past.

Thanks,
Melissa

Just curious - did you ever catch up with Larry Joe Hunter regarding the Long 
Term Southwest desk's futures deal with Sempra? I'm wondering if I should 
grab Matt Motley before he goes home today to let him know he needs to get a 
hold of Tim Cannon about the ADT. Let me know when and if you talk to him.

Thanks,
Kate
