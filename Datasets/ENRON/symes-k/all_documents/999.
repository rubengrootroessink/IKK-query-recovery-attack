Kate,

 for ref 490710 ( Mike Swerzbin) Prebon just sent over a confirm and the 
broker is showing Enron as the seller and Sempra as the buyer.

for ref 490640 (Mike Swerzbin) Prebon just sent over a confirm and the broker 
is showing Enron as the buyer and Sempra as the seller

Can you check with Mike and verify this because I confirmed this differently 
with Prebon.

Thanks!!

They are good deals, but we don't have deal numbers because Mike is out of 
the office right now and said he wanted to check with the broker personally 
before verifying the price. He's aware that the deals will have to go in late 
and be backdated, and that they will not be in his calculation for the day. 
Please let me know if there's anything else I can do.

Kate
