It looks like you made quite a few changes to some deals and I don't see 
anything in the comment section.  Can you just take a quick look and see if 
you know what you changed on any of these.  If not, I can look it up in the 
audit viewer, but it makes things go a lot quicker if we don't have to go 
into the audit viewer for each deal.

Thanks!
