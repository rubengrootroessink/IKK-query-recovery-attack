Crosscurrents
MAUS CULTURE
by Peter Swanson
Mar 29 | "It seems there's a movement afoot to class-up comic books -- both
adult comics, by moving them out of the ghetto of specialty stores and
sci-fi racks, and kids comics, by giving them a significant place in our
pop-culture canon. I do not doubt for a moment the artistic merits of many
of the books and writers in the comics field, adult or otherwise. What I
wonder about is this sudden bid for legitimacy. If some of these upstarts
find themselves lodged between the Styrons and the Tans on the big people
shelves, will they still talk to the superhero comics?" From DC and Marvel
to the latest wave of serious graphic novels, the comic book has come of
age. Peter Swanson surveys the scene, and waxes just a bit nostalgic.

Interviews
A. L. KENNEDY: SPASMS OF GRACE
by Julia Livshin
Mar 29 | "There's no bloodlust. And even with a very good matador and a
very good bull, the nature of the thing is that it isn't seamless and it
can't be entirely graceful. There will be spasms of grace. It's a very odd,
ramshackle thing. There are all kinds of strange pauses and clumsy bits,
and patches of costume drama, and then patches of this very odd, sometimes
beautiful communication." A conversation with the Scottish novelist A. L.
Kennedy, whose new book, *On Bullfighting*, describes the "death,
transcendence, immortality, joy, pain, isolation and fear" that is the
Spanish corrida.

Unbound Fiction
POINTS OF INTEREST
by Robert Cohen
Mar 21 | "And then, I don't know, there was something about the way they
looked that made me think: remember this. The light, the bees humming in
the grass, the lazy inconsequential flow of the afternoon, and your
daughter, your irritable knock-kneed eight-and-a-half year old daughter,
who will never be just this way again, just this tanned and skinny and
unselfconscious, this careless, careless.... I didn't think about it after
that. It was all reflex."

Interviews
KAREN ARMSTRONG: DIVINE RETICENCE
by Harvey Blume
Mar 21 | "When I first began the study of religion, I found it difficult to
get a handle on Buddhism. It didn't have any of the things I considered
essential to religion, like a supernatural God, a sense of sin, authority
figures, doctrines. But the more I got into religious studies, the more I
began to think that this approach, this reticence about the divine, had a
good deal to recommend it." Harvey Blume talks with the author of *Buddha*,
the biography of a world-historical figure about whom nothing is truly
known.
