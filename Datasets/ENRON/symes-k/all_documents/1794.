STABLE PRICE AND SUPPLY ACTIVISTS ARE PREPARED TO MOVE TO COAL
  Skyrocketing oil and natural gas prices are leading power- generating 
utility companies to reconsider coal as an attractive fuel for future power

relations with Peabody Group. "We expect to see more coal- based generations 
in the future."
