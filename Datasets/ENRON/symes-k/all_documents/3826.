Hi Kate,
 I gave your work number to Rick North from the Northwest Earth Institute.
 We just finished an eight week discussion group in my office on "Choices
for Sustainable Living" and it was very interesting, eye opening. Thought
that with all you are learning about energy, you and some of your more
environmentally oriented co-workers might be interested in such a
discussion group.  I told him you would be changing jobs soon, and may not
have time to get anything started.  He suggested that you may know someone
else in your office who could help.  It's really quite important, this
business of sustainability.  I hope you can look into it.  Mom.
