For the two deals traded on yesterday with Tom and Mark the fee is showing as 
$15.00 flat on both confirmations.  Can you send revisions.
The numbers are 20010416410003 and 20010416410002

Thanks

That is not the case. I know what Mark and Tom trade, I apologize if I
misspoke. All daily trades, as well as hourly trades will now be a flat fee
charge of $15 per trade. This covers any size transaction.
