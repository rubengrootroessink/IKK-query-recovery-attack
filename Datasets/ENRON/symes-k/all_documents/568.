here are emails on earlier deals that I think set the legacy for the deals 
you are now working with.  Talk to me.

This should have said $1,728 for August.  Sorry.  kyle

Cara, thanks.  All the deals look good.  However, if at all possible, we 
really need to have annuities to reflect each months activity.  In order for 
each months activity to be correctly booked into SAP, we need it divided out 
this way.  Right now it looks like we have $4,928 for September.  We need it 
to show $1600 for Spetember and July and $1,728 for July.  Thanks.  Kyle

The annuity amount is reflective of the charge for the entire deal, the date 
is just the day it was put in the system.  If you multiply the volume of leg 
1 by .05, the amount of the annuity is the result.

The AutoScheduling for the July pieces is now done.  

360937.1  for 7/1-7/31
360940.1  for 7/10 - 7/31
360943.1 for 7/8 - 7/31

I'm still showing that the following deals have not been corrected:

360937.1  for 7/1-7/31
360940.1  for 7/10 - 7/31
360943.1 for 7/8 - 7/31

We also need to enter annuities for the two purchases to reflect the 5 cent 
charge for July and August.  There has already been an annuity entered for 
September.

Thanks.  Kyle

I have gone back in and Re-autoScheduled the following deals, and looked at 
them in Scheduling.

360940
360943
360937
360983

Please let me know if this gets us done. Are there still some annuities 
missing? The ones for these deals looked ok.

Diana, we really need to get these deals fixed this week.  Joy cannot 
checkout with PGET and I cannot check out with EES for July or August until 
these deals are fixed.  Just as a reminder, PGET needs to have the price 
zeroed out from July 1 forward.  EES needs to have the price zeroed out, 
except for the 5 cent offset, for July 1 forward.  Currently, July 1 - Aug 21 
still have prices in them.  We also need to have the 5 cent offset corrected 
for EES on our purchase side (the offset is going the worng way).  Please 
call me to let me know what we can do to ensure this change takes place this 
week.  Thank you.  Kyle 3-7579

Diana, can you tell me the status of this.  We really need to get these deals

Joy,

Can you please give us the EES deal number also.  We will be showing a huge 
expense if we don't adjust both sides!
