Stacey,

I rolled back fwdobl.exe Sunday since a trader in the WEST found a big 
problem.
Currently, Kroum is fixing the problem.

Thanks,
dluu

Please note that the forward obligations report will now read from the 
Scheduling Tables rather than the Deal Entry Tables whenever scheduling data 
exists.  Please forward this e-mail this to other individuals in your groups 
who use this report.  The data was tested by the Portland office, if you 
notice problems with the report please refer your questions to Kroum Kroumov 
or Duong Luu.

Thanks,
Stacey

I've tested the "schedule" version of forward obs.  It seems to be working 
well.  

The wish list might include a summary page to show the desks net 0. And it 
could use a default that pulls all the west desks when the West portfolio is 
clicked, while retaining the flexibility of overriding the west default to 
choose individual desks - HOWEVER - it does work fine the way it is.

Please release this to production and let Fran Chang, Heather Dunton, 
Samantha Law and Diana Scholtes know when it is released.  Thanks!
