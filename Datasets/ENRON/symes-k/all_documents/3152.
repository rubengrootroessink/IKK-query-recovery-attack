CHINA: A WORLD POWER AGAIN (August 1999)
by Robert D. Kaplan
"The United States-China relationship, so prone to cultural and historical
misinterpretation, could be among the most unstable great-power
relationships in history.... Chinese influence is seeping into more and
more of Asia. However justified our positions may be, dealing with China
will require cool realpolitik and scholarly know-how, not self-righteous
hysteria."
http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/99aug/9908china.htm

Plus,

The Atlantic has reported on China for more than a century. A selection of
Atlantic articles from 1899 to the present puts U.S.-China relations in
perspective.

Politics & Prose
HITLER'S WILLING BUSINESS PARTNERS
by Jack Beatty
Apr 4 | "You are IBM founder Thomas Watson, it is 1937, and you must know
that the census and other work your German branch has performed for the
Nazis has been used not just to count cars and cows but to identify Jews.
Perhaps you have even read the comment of a Nazi statistician that 'In
using statistics the government now has the road map to switch from
knowledge to deeds.' You have visited Germany; you were in Berlin in July,
1935, when Black Shirts rampaged through the streets smashing the windows
of Jewish stores. Now, in recognition of your services to the Third Reich,
Hitler wants to give you a medal. Will you accept it?" Jack Beatty on *IBM
and the Holocaust* -- a shocking account of Big Blue's dealings with Nazi
Germany -- and on what the critics have failed to grasp.

Corby's Table
PASTA WITH A PASSION
by Corby Kummer
Apr 4 | "Whether they'll admit it or not, critics and food people go to
certain favorite restaurants whenever they pass through a city. Not because
these are the most daring spots, or the places to be seen, but because the
diner knows he or she will eat wonderfully. It's like settling back into
home. Valentino, in Santa Monica, California, is one of those restaurants.
Now the owner, Piero Selvaggio, has written his own cookbook, together with
Karen Stabiner, and it's one of the few Italian cookbooks I plan to keep on
my shelf." Corby Kummer reviews *The Valentino Cookbook*, and offers
selections.
