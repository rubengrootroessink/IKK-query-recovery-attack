I've handed this over to Jeff Richter, who will speak with his contact at 
Aquila to sort this out. We were both confused about the discrepancy, 
however, because if the deal didn't exist there would have been problems in 
scheduling on Oct. 12; and so far we haven't heard anything. I'm sorry this 
didn't get taken care of more quickly, but Jeff was in a meeting this 
afternoon.

Thanks,
Kate

Kate,
Aquila noted on our confirmation, that they DO NOT KNOW TRADE IN SYSTEM.  
Lisa Robinson (back office at Aquila) said she asked her trader and he does 
not know trade.  Please ask Jeff to contact trader.  Please keep me posted.  
Thanks
