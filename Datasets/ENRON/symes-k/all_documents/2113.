do not reflect the option in the system.  we will take care of that if we 
exercise the option.  it would be good to get the proper transaction 
execution date in there.

Tim - would you like a copy of this deal's confirmation letter?

Carla - you entered this deal on 2/23/01. Should it be back-dated to match 
trade date on confirmation letter?

Thanks,
Kate
