A fellow employee has been diagnosed with the measles.  If you have any 
concerns, I would encourage you to contact your physician.  

The employees who are most at risk are:
Women who are pregnant.
Anyone who has not been immunized and has not had the measles.

If you require a visit to the doctor for a vaccination or check-up as a 
result of potentially being exposed to the measles, Enron will reimburse you 
for your medical co-pay.  Please submit a copy of your receipt to me for 
processing.

If you have any questions or I can be of further assistance, please contact 
me.

Amy
