You've probably seen some of these before, but they're
classics.
Have fun,

Bizarre facts of this world

In Lebanon, men are legally allowed to have sex with
animals, but the animals must be female. Having sexual
relations with a male animal are punishable by death.
(Like THAT makes sense.)

In Bahrain, a male doctor may legally examine a
woman's genitals, but is prohibited from looking
directly at them during the examination. He may only
see their reflection in a mirror.

Muslims are banned from looking at the genitals of a
corpse. This also applies to undertakers; the sex
organs of the deceased must be covered with a brick or
piece of wood at all times. (A brick??)

The penalty for masturbation in Indonesia is
decapitation.

There are men in Guam whose full-time job is to travel
the countryside and deflower young virgins, who pay
them for the privilege of having sex for the first
time... Reason: under Guam law, it is expressly
forbidden for virgins to marry. (Let's just think for
a minute; is there any job anywhere else in the world
that even comes close to this?)

In Hong Kong, a betrayed wife is legally allowed to
kill her adulterous husband, but may only do so with
her bare hands. The husband's lover, on the other
hand, may be killed in any manner desired. (Ah!
Justice!)

Topless saleswomen are legal in Liverpool, England -
but only in tropical fish stores.(But of course!)

In Cali, Colombia, a woman may only have sex with her
husband, and the first time this happens, her mother
must be in the room to witness the act. (Makes one
shudder at the thought.)

In Santa Cruz, Bolivia, it is illegal for a man to
have sex with a woman and her daughter at the same
time. (I presume this was a big enough problem that
they had to pass this law?)

In Maryland, it is illegal to sell condoms from
vending machines with one exception: prophylactics may
be dispensed from a vending machine only "in places
where alcoholic beverages are sold for consumption on
the premises." (Is this a great country or what? Not
as great as Guam!)

If you yelled for 8 years, 7 months and 6 days, you
would have produced enough sound energy to heat one
cup of coffee. (Hardly seems worth it)

If you fart consistently for 6 years and 9 months,
enough gas is produced to create the energy of an
atomic bomb. (Now that's more like it)

A pig's orgasm lasts for 30 minutes. (In my next life
I want to be a pig)

Banging your head against a wall uses 150 calories an
hour. (Still not over that pig thing)

Humans and dolphins are the only species that have sex
for pleasure. (Is that why Flipper was always
smiling?)

The strongest muscle in the body is the tongue.
(Hummm....I won't touch THAT one!)

The ant can lift 50 times its own weight, can pull 30
times its own weight and always falls over on its
right side when intoxicated. (From drinking little
bottles of...?) (Did the govt. pay for this
research??)

Some lions mate over 50 times a day. (In my next life
I STILL want to be a pig ... quality over quantity)

Butterflies taste with their feet. (Ah, geez)

An ostrich's eye is bigger than it's brain. (I know
some people like that.)

Starfish don't have brains. (I know some people like
that too)

After reading all these, all I can say is.......Damn
Those Pigs.
