Hello fellow team members.

So I have recruited all of you to help out in the Enron Elves program. The 
program is designed to help raise funds to buy gifts for a family and 
currently, we (West Desk) has sponsored three families. Our family has two 
kids with a single parent (mother). There is an 11-year old daughter and 
8-year old son.

I hope that everyone will do their best to help out. We basically need to 
raise money by asking people we know and even companies that some of you 
might have ties with and then we go shopping and finally wrap the presents 
and deliver them to the family. 

The money should be in by Friday December 15th and the gift wrapping is 
scheduled for Tuesday December 19th. We will go shopping for the gifts in 
between then.

We need to keep track of the amount of the donation, name and address of the 
person that donated so that they are able to use the donation as a tax 
deduction.  If you have any other questions or ideas about gifts or raising 
money, feel free to stop by my desk or email me. 

Happy Thanksgiving and let's go raise some money.

Jeffrey Oh
