If it doesn't make any difference, I will change these to the other CP name.  
This one is not attached to templates and would need some database changes to 
prepare a confirmation under this name.  If this is not ok, let me know.

Thanks!

I checked with Heather, and it turns out this second NCPA counterparty 
shortname was set up to distinguish between two different SC numbers. But 
it's only for internal use - both counterparty names have the same billing 
information, etc. So Heather said the deals are fine as they are. I'm going 
to find out more about this after the afternoon rush dies down - just so 
we'll know for the future when to use which shortname.

These two deals are entered with a special counterparty name that looks like 
it may have been set up for some special deal.  There is another counterparty 
name out there that looks just the same only without the very last series of 
letters.  I will check here and see if anyone knows the difference.  There is 
a note in the Global System that says Heather Dunton had this CP set up.  If 
you could check with her and see if it should be used for these deals or if 
the other CP should be used.

Thanks!
