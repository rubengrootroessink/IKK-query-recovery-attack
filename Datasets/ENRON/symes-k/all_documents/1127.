Yo sista,

Sorry I've been so MIA.  You know how it is: move to a new city, lack the
money to buy groceries or put roof over head let alone purchase a calling
card.  I am enjoying my internship and even starbucks (it's kind of fun!),
but I am DEAD broke and trying to figure out how to pay rent this month.  So
I guess nothing's new . . .

Outward Bound is nice.  The "office" is an old renovated house about six
blocks from my apartment, which is a godsend when it snows (which it did
today, a lot).  The people here are generally really mellow - I'm sure you
can imagine.  Lots of "bro!", "dude!" and "no worries!" like we're
Australian surfers or something.  I actually heard somebody call some slides
(as in picture slides) the "slidey-slides" the other day.  But they're all
super nice, and I have my own desk and phone and voice mail, so I feel
important.  Starbucks is pretty fucking funny (again, use your imagination).
Everyone I work with is tall, skinny, male, goateed, and painfully in the
closet.  And you should hear the crap that people order - they actually have
a CODE for "half-caf" now.  Idiots - do you even know what actual coffee
tastes like?

So I heard you're moving in with Molly and Amber.  That should be fun.
Honestly, Kate, I love it here, but I think I'll be back sooner than I
thought.  I'm starting to think I could be really happy in Portland.  But
you can't beat the weather in Denver - it's sunny practically everyday!  And
the guys here know how to buy pants that fit properly over their shoes.  You
have to visit!  Our apartment is big and we could go out with Monica and it
would be really fun!  My phone number, by the way, is (303) 777-7132.  So
call me if you ever get those free long distance thingies that cell phones
tend to get.  Okay, let me know the gossip in p-town.  Love, anna

How goes it, girlfriend? I just got your message - sorry I haven't been in
touch yet, and I can give you all the excuses in the book about how I've
been swamped with work, play, life in general, but we both know I'm just
flaky, so there's no point in explaining it.

Anyway, I'm so excited to hear you're doing well in your new Rocky Mountain
dwelling, but you left me here with no good pissing and moaning (and
getting "pissed") buddies. So I checked out airfares to Denver, and found
one for $118 roundtrip! Can you freakin' believe it? Anyway, you have to
purchase and use the ticket by the end of March, so I was thinking a little
spring break action was called for. Do you think you'd be settled enough by
the end of March to accomodate a portly older sister for a few days? Let me
know, and I'll do the deal.

Got to go - business abounds at Enron as usual. I'll try to drop you a line
tonight when I have more time to write. Do you have a phone number? Amber
was in Denver over the weekend, and she and Monica called me trying to get
ahold of you, but I had no idea where to look. (Except somewhere in Denver,
but from what I've heard it's a fairly big place.)

Write back soon, or call - I want to know how the internship is. But more
importantly, how's the unlimited Starbucks coffee?

Love,
Kate
