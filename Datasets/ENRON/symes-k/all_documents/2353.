mike swerzbin, and can you give me the deal number that you are killing, 
unless you have already told sharon or amy, so that we make sure we have not 
already sent a confirm.

thanks

Mike still has about 6 deals to put in, and those are two of them. It should 
just be a minute. 

I'm killing a deal right now so my deal entry is tied up - who's the trader 
on 541368?
