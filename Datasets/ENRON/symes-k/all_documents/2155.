I don't really understand the whole "work like you don't need the money"
thing, but the statistics are interesting.
Love you guys, Anna

FRIENDHSIP WEEK

If we could shrink the earth's population to a village of precisely
100 people, with all the existing human ratios remaining the same, it
would look something like the following: there would be:

57 asians
21 europeans
14 from the western hemisphere, both north and south
8  africans

52 would be female
48 would be male

70 would be non-white
30 would be white
70 would be non-christian
30 would be christian
89 would be heterosexual
11 would be homosexual
6  people would possess 59% of the entire world's wealth and all 6 be
from  the United States.
80 would live in substandard housing
70 would be unable to read
50 would suffer from malnutrition
1  would be near death
1  would be near birth
1  (yes, only 1) would have a college education
1  would own a computer

When one considers our world from such a compressed perspective, the
need for acceptance, understanding and education becomes glaringly
apparent.

The following is also something to ponder...

If you woke up this morning with more health than illness...you are
more blessed than the million who will not survive this week. If you have
never experienced the danger of battle, the loneliness of imprisonment, the
agony of torture, or the pangs of starvation you are ahead of 500 million
people in the world.

If you can attend a church meeting without fear of harassment,
arrest, torture, or death...you are more blessed than three billion people
in
the world.

If you have food in the refrigerator, clothes on your back, a roof
overhead and a place to sleep...you are richer than 75% of this
world.

If you have money in the bank, in your wallet, and spare change in a
dish someplace ... you are among the top 8% of the world's wealthy.

If your parents are still alive and still married ... you are very
rare.

If you can read this message, you just received a double blessing in
that someone was thinking of you, and furthermore, you are more blessed
than over two billion people in the world that cannot read at all.

Someone once said:  what goes around comes around.

Work  like you don't need the money.
Love  like you've never been hurt.
Dance like nobody's watching.
Sing  like nobody's listening.
Live  like it's heaven on earth.

It's national friendship week. Send this to everyone you consider a
friend. Pass this on, and brighten someone's day. Nothing will happen
if you do not decide to pass it along. the only thing that will happen,
if you do pass it on, is that someone might smile because of you.
