Responses and Expressions of Interest Requested by May 4, 2001 
The University is seeking to have a contract ready for consideration for 
approval by its Board of Curators on May 24-25 2001.

Power Requirements 

The University of Missouri, Columbia Campus, ("MU") requests proposals to 
purchase approximately 50,000 MWH of interruptible power during non-summer 
months, with potential hourly purchases of up to 15 MW in certain hours, and 
potential additional purchases during summer months, commencing June 1, 2001 
and continuing through May 31, 2002. MU is seeking power with specified 
interruptibility during the non-summer months, with scheduling of power 
during summer months on a week-to-week basis only as economic for the 
prospective supplier ("Supplier") and for MU. 

Also included in this request for proposals is a Pro Forma Contract 
("Contract"). MU's specific requirements appear in Exhibit A of the Contract. 

The Contract may be used by prospective suppliers in their offers, however, 
MU is willing to enter tariff-based agreements with suppliers which have such 
agreements on file at the FERC. In such case, the Pro Forma Contract should 
still be reviewed, as MU may require tariffs be amended to conform to 
Contract criteria either directly or through appended transaction documents. 

Delivery will be to the City of Columbia Water and Light Department (the 
"City"). MU has an agreement with the City for transmission to MU. 

Power Sales 

During the term of this Agreement, Electricity Supplier shall have the option 
of purchasing electricity from MU for purposes of resale during periods in 
which MU does not require the electricity for its own use.? Such electricity 
shall originate from MU's on-site facilities, which are qualifying 
cogeneration facilities under the Public Utilities Regulatory Policy Act of 
1978.? Such electricity shall be subject to the operation of MU's gas-fired 
facilities. 

(a) Availability:? From MU's generation, in quantities up to 15 MW. 
(b) Notice:? A minimum of six hours' notice for periods of time at least 6 
hours in duration . 
(c) Pricing of Saleback Service: Pricing of electricity under Saleback 
Service shall be calculated as equal to "80% of profit" plus "cost" where 

"Profit" equals 
(1) the price paid to Electricity Supplier for electricity, less the sum of? 
(2) transmission costs incurred by Electricity Supplier plus the actual price 
of natural gas (in BTUs) delivered to the MU power plant (burner tip) 
multiplied by 20,000 for each kWh provided by MU under this Paragraph.? 
"Cost" equals the actual price of natural gas (in BTUs) delivered to the MU 
power plant (burner tip) multiplied by 20,000 for each kWh provided by MU 
under this Paragraph.
