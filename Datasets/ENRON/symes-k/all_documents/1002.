If you haven't been able to get the Livelink system to work, this might be a 
good opportunity to get it on your PC.

Subject: Visit to Portland

I am planning to come to the Portland Office on Mon., Jan. 22 and Tues., Jan. 
23.  I am planning to bring Melissa Murphy with me so that she can meet 
everyone in the office.  Melissa is taking over as Lead for me on Power since 
my responsibilities have grown the past few months.  I will still be directly 
responsible for Power Confirmations but am now also responsible for 
management of Physical/Financial Gas Confirmations, Contracts and Financial 
Settlements.  

I was thinking of also bringing someone to do some training on Livelink (the 
document imaging system).  I know that a few of you have been encountering 
problems when using the application.  I would like for this person to see 
they types of problems that you are having so that we can get them fixed.  As 
well, I know that there are a few more advanced features of Livelink that may 
be of interest (i.e. project sharing, etc.).

Let me know you thoughts on this or if you think that it would be beneficial 
to you and others in the office for a Livelink rep. to come with me.  Thanks!

Kim Theriot
