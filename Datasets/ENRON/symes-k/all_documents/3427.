Hi everyone!

I have begun to document all special situations and counterparties that are 
exceptions to our "not to be confirmed" rules.  Thus, in the future, when we 
need to answer questions regarding why certain deals are unconfirmed, there 
will be no confusion about where the directives not to do so originated.

Please review this document carefully.  Go ahead and make any changes that 
you'd like -but please change your font color so that I will know which items 
you have added.  I will incorporate all of your edits to the master document 
and save it to a common drive where it can be accessed and updated whenever 
necessary.

If you can think of any additional "not to be confirmed" 
exceptions/situations, or more specific details  -please add them.  Please 
let me know if you have any questions.



Thanks for your input,
Kimberly Hundl x31647
