I asked Heather to autoschedule them a little while ago, and she said it 
would be no problem.  But thanks for asking.

Thanks for fixing that stuff, Stan. Do you need me to autoschedule the deals?

Audrey,

Concerning deal #579038:  This was a mistake on my part, the price should in 
fact be $80 (as the APX is showing).  I've fixed the price in Enpower.

Concerning deal #581335:  This trade did take place between Enron and Sierra 
Pacific Industries (not the APX).  I mistakenly put that deal in under the 
wrong counterparty.  I've fixed the counterparty in Enpower.

I will ask Fran Chang to autoschedule both deals.  Let me know if I need to 
do anything further.

Thanks,
Stan

Kate & Stan,
Deal #579038.1
Enron is showing $85 for the offpeak load on 4/13 & 4/14..... APX is showing 
$80 for offpeak on 4/13 & 4/14....please verify and correct if necessary.  I 
have also attached APX invoice per the internet website below for both days.

Deal 581335.1
APX is currently not showing that this deal occurred for 4/16 for offpeak 
load (see screen  below at the bottom).  Please verify if this is some other 
c/p's deal.  Thanks.
