Matt doesn't have any trade like this for 1/8. I spoke with Judy at EES, and 
she's going to have Jubran call Matt to duke it out over whether or not this 
is a good trade. I'll let you know what those guys decide. 

Thanks,
Kate

Kate, 
Pwx called this mroning to verbal a deal that  was sleeved with EES.  I do 
not see it in system, although I see the deal on EES spreadsheet that I 
receive daily.
the deal is Enron Buys Pwx   Q4 2001 25mws   255.00  done direct  trade date 
1/8/01  Matt Motley trader
then Enron Sell EES  Q4 2001  25mws   $255.05

Should this be in the system and if so do you have deal numbers on the 
above.  I believe we sleeved the deal for EES and Pwx.  
Contact at EES, Judy (backoffice 7138535490)  Jubran Whalen is EES trader.

Thanks
