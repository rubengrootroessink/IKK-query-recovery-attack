Hey Kate! I received a phone call from a Jim Cross from Automated Power 
Exchange. Now that we are confirming daily's he mentioned that he did not 
want to receive dailys per the APX Master Agreement. He told me that all 
trades are anonimus under the APX agreement and we should not be confirming 
theses. Examples: #563948 and #563381. Some of the trader doing these trades 
are Chris Mallory and Les Rawson. Could you ask them is we should continue to 
confirm these daily's or not?

Thanks

Kimberly
