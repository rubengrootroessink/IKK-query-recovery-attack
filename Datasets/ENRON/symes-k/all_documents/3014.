Subject: Unit Contingent Deals  

I spoke with Les about these deals, and he told me he'd like unit contingent 
SALES confirmed, and unit contingent BUYS not confirmed. I sorted through 
these deal numbers and changed the buys to not be confirmed, and it looks 
like most of the sales already have the unit name in the comments section. 
Following is the list of deals you sent me and notes on what I did:

562211 - changed to "no confirm"
564613 - changed to "no confirm"
566060 - unit name is in comments section
566062 - unit name is in comments section
566069 - unit name is in comments section
566071 - unit name is in comments section
566077 - unit is Willamette Albany Paper Mill/comments section is full - ???
566078 - unit name is in comments section
556116 - unit is LV Cogen/added to comments
554737 - unit is LV Cogen/added to comments

Les and I also talked about creating a master list of delivery points and 
their respective unit names for future reference. Please let me know if you 
think that would be helpful. In the meantime, feel free to send these lists 
to me.

Thanks,
Kate

Hi Kate!
Hope you had a good weekend!
We need to know the unit name on these two unit contingent deals for Salt 
River Project.
Thanks!
