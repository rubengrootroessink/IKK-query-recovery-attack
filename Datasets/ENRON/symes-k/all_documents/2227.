Mr. Luu,
Nadine and I both tested the prod code against TestN database and have not 
been able to reproduce this, or any other, error.  Is it possible that the 
trader miss-entered the information? Since it was entered yesterday, we 
cannot see exactly what was entered in Blotter.
However, it took greater than 10 minutes for some of the deals to be 
EnPowered.  This is not usually the case, obviously, and I was only doing one 
deal at a time.

I will continue to work on it Monday if you think I should.  Have a good 
weekend.
Laura

Good Morning,

When a transmission deal is entered in blotter, for some reason the volume 
also gets put in to the loss column as well, showing us with the full volume 
on one end of the deal, and zero volume on the other.

This happened with two deals today,  deal 535344 and 535343 put into blotter 
by Crandall.  Once the problem was identified, I went into the deal and 
changed the loss volume to zero.
