I spoke with Kim Hundle and deal # 458802 is not with EES I wasn't sure if I 
had wrote the number down wrong or not.  Sorry.    I also spoke with Neil 
Bresnan after we had spoke and he had said it should be no problem getting 
you on the list.  I will check again and I apologize for the delay.
Thanks
Judy
