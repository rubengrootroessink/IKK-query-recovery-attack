the broker does not show these trades twice, already confirmed deals 534167 
and 534168.  pls verify that sean or diana did both of these deals twice.

Verified with Diana and Sean - these should be APB.

and the Williams deal should be resolved - deal # is 534497

i have 2 more things besides the williams deal.  apb is trying to leave thats 
why i was trying to get these deals resolved.

534496
534497

apb does not recognize, these may be duplicated deals that are already in the 
system.

thanks
