Hi Kate, I just changed deal # 473100 from Monday through Friday to Monday 
through Saturday.  This deal was manually entered by us because it failed the 
EOL bridge.  When we manually entered it the wrong days were chosen.  I have 
fixed it and we will send a revised confirm to the counterparty.  I am not 
sure if you normally tell risk when you make a change.  

Thanks,
Melissa
