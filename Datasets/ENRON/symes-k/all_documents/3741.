Kate, could you help us on deal #595155.1 that is showing up as a purchase 
from Enron Energy Marketing which Brooklyn dose not show any purchases.  This 
deal is Short Term California desk.  We also have a small variance with sales 
but Brooklyn and I still need to review.  

Kate I looked for your e-mail and can not find the one you sent me telling me 
what you look over.  Could you please resend it?  thanks.
