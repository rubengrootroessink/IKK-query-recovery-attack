The confirmation is still coming over with 32 hours a day, but I can fix it 
to read 16 hours a day as long as it is valuing correctly for you guys in the 
calc.  This is very strange.  I don't know why it is coming over like that.  
Let me know if they get it fixed, or if this is something we are going to 
have to know about when strips are deleted and we prepare a confirmation.

Thanks!

I've changed the deal - we're running into some problems rolling out the new 
Full Service Power application. Apparently it's messed with some details of 
Deal Entry, including the deletion of strips. So you'll see three strips in 
this deal, two of which have no price and no volume. I hope that's okay! Will 
Smith in Houston IT is working on it now. Let me know if you see the right 
term and volume now.

Thanks,
Kate

I believe this deal was changed, bu tnot changed correctly.  The hours are 
doubled up and it is running 32 hours a day.

Thanks!
