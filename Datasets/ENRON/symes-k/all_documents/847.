Dear Daily Power Report Subscriber:

Attached is the most recent issue of Power Executive.

As an end-of-year bonus for all Daily Power Report readers, we've arranged 
with the publisher of Power Executive to offer a final discount on their 
market-leading publication-- $150 off the regular price of $649. However, 
this offer ends on 1/5. If you contact us before that date you can subscribe 
to Power Executive for only $499 per year!! This is the lowest rate Power 
Executive has offered this year, and they tell us we will not see it again.

Special Bonus-- Also, if you subscribe before 1/5/01 the publisher will 
forward to you a CD filled with all back issues of Power Executive from year 
2000, absolutely free.

Again, this is a limited offer, contact us before 1/5/01. Have a great 
holiday.

Check it out, and if you'd like to subscribe, just give us your name, email 
and telephone number, hit "reply" and a subscription agent will contact you. 
You can also find a subscription coupon on the back page of the newsletter.
