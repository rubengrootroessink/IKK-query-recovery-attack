Hi Kate, Cara,

I'm the new Enpower QA here in Houston, replacing Nadine who has moved on to 
another project.  There was a bug found in the Fwd Obl report, concerning the 
desk choice disappearing after the report has been ran.  Corry Bentley here 
in Houston has looked at the fix and I would like for you two to have a 
chance to view it also before moving it to production.  It is currently in 
Stage, and as soon as you both get a chance to test it, and give it your ok, 
I can get it moved to production.  If you have any questions please e-mail me 
back, or feel free to call.

Thanks a lot,

Brett Pate
Enpower QA
