Kate, I think Tom Alonso entered this trade under the wrong counterparty. I 
think it should be FPL Energy Power Marketing instead of Florida Power and 
Light. I received a confirm from FPL Energy Marketing for this trade. Can you 
as Tom and then change in system if I am correct.

Thanks for your help!
