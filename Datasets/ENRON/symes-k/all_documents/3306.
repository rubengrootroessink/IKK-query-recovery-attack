April 12, 2001

+ THIS WEEK ...

"However much we think of poetry as a disciplined scatter of words on
white, or the proud aestheticism of the thin volume," Sven Birkerts
writes in Atlantic Unbound this week, "it remains, at root,
historically and performatively, a pneumatic event. Pneumatic, from
the Greek root pneuma, relating to wind or air, but inescapably
carrying overtones of 'spirit' and 'soul.'"

Poetry has been the soul of Atlantic Unbound from the start. In fact,
the very first Web-only feature produced for The Atlantic's site,
coinciding with its official launch on November 1, 1995, included
recordings of Robert Pinsky reading excerpts from his acclaimed
translation of Dante's *Inferno*, the sound of his voice streaming
over the Internet in RealAudio 1.0, or downloaded in 8-bit .AU files.
(See http://www.theatlantic.com/unbound/aandc/dante/danthome.htm --
and don't worry, the audio quality has since been upgraded.)

Five months later, on April 1, 1996, we launched the Poetry Pages
(http://www.theatlantic.com/poetry/). Featured that month were Peter
Davison's introduction and readings of Robert Frost's poems from the
August, 1915, Atlantic, along with readings by Rodney Jones and
Stephen Sandy of their poems appearing in the April issue,
inaugurating our ever-growing Audible Anthology of Atlantic poems
read aloud by the authors. (The anthology now contains more than 200
recordings by 81 poets. See
http://www.theatlantic.com/unbound/poetry/antholog/aaindx.htm)

This month, to mark the fifth anniversary of the Poetry Pages, we're
presenting three text-and-audio features: Frank Bidart, Peter
Davison, and Robert Pinsky read Robert Lowell's poem "For the Union
Dead" (originally published in The Atlantic for November 1960), with
an introduction by Davison; Christopher Ricks reads and comments on
T. S. Eliot's "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock"; and Sven
Birkerts reviews newly released recordings of Randall Jarrell, one of
the twentieth century's great poet-critics, reading his own poems
(you can hear Jarrell reading "The Death of the Ball Turret Gunner"
and "The Woman at the Washington Zoo").

Read, listen, and enjoy.

Cheers,

Wen Stephenson

* A post-script to our longtime TransAtlantic readers:

This is my last collection of Web-only features commissioned and
edited as editorial director of The Atlantic Online, though I'm happy
to say that they are not the last poetry features I will edit for the
site. (I'm leaving the staff of The Atlantic next month, but I will
continue to edit the site's Poetry Pages.) I am profoundly grateful
for having had the opportunity to work on The Atlantic's online
edition for what is almost seven years now. And I am grateful most of
all to my Atlantic colleagues, past and present; to the many writers
who have lent their words and their voices to our cause; and to you
our readers, who have lent your eyes and ears. Best wishes to all. -WS
