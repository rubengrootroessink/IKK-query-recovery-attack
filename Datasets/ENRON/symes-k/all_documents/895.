This is what The Dali Lama has to say on the millennium, which
>>begins 01/01/2001. All it takes is a few seconds to read and think
>>about.
>>
>>Do not keep this message. The mantra must leave your hands within 96
>>hours. You will get a very pleasant surprise. This is true even if
>>you are not superstitious.
>>
