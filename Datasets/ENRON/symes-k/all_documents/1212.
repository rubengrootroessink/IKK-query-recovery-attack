>>and
>> > here's some interesting facts:
>> >
>> > >The #1 thing men look for in a potential victim is hairstyle. They are
>>most
>> > likely to go after a woman with a ponytail, bun, braid or other
>>hairstyle
>> > that can easily be grabbed. They are also likely to go after a woman
>>with
>> > long hair. Women with short hair are not common targets.
>> >
>> > The second thing men look for is clothing. They will look for women
>>who's
>> > clothing is easy to remove quickly. The #1 outfit they look for is
>>overalls
>> > because many of them carry scissors around to cut clothing and on
>>overalls
>> > the straps can be easily cut.
>> >
>> > They also look for women on their cell phone, searching through their
>>purse
>> > or doing other activities while walking because they are off guard and
>>can
>> > be easily overpowered.
>> >
>> > >The time of day men are most likely to attack and rape a woman is in
>>the
>> > early morning, between 5 and 8:30 a.m. The number one place women are
>> > abducted from/attacked at is grocery store parking lots. Number two is
>> > office parking lots/garages. Number three is public restrooms.
>> >
>> > The thing about these men is that they are looking to grab a woman and
>> > quickly move her to a second location where they don't have to worry
>>about
>> > getting caught. Only 2% said they carried weapons because rape carries
>>a
>>3-5
>> > year sentence but rape with a weapon is 15-20 years.
>> >
>> > If you put up any kind of a fight at all, they get discouraged because
>>it
>> > only takes a minute or two for them to realize that going after you
>>isn't
>> > worth it because it will be time-consuming.
>> >
>> > These men said they will not pick on women who have umbrellas, or other
>> > similar objects that can be used from a distance, in
>> > >their hands. Keys are not a deterrent because you have to get really
>>close
>> > to the attacker to use them as a weapon. So, the idea
>> > is to convince these guys you're not worth it. Several defense
>>mechanisms
>>he
>> > taught us are:
>> >
>> > >* If someone is following behind you on a street or in a garage or
>>with
>>you
>> > in an elevator or stairwell, look them in the face and ask them a
>>question,
>> > like what time is it, or make general small talk, I can't believe  it
>>is
>>so
>> > cold out here, we're in for a bad winter. Now you've seen their face
>>and
>> > could identify them in a lineup, you lose appeal as a target.
>> >
>> > >* If someone is coming toward you, hold out your hands in front of you
>>and
>> > yell Stop or Stay back! Most of the rapists this man
>> > talked to said they'd leave a woman alone if she yelled or showed that
>>she
>> > would not be afraid to fight back. Again, they are looking for an EASY
>> > target.
>> >
>> > If you carry pepper spray (this instructor was a huge advocate of it
>>and
>> > carries it with him wherever he goes,) yelling I HAVE PEPPER SPRAY and
>> > holding it out will be a deterrent.
>> >
>> > >* If someone grabs you, you can't beat them with strength but you can
>>by
>> > outsmarting them. If they grab your wrist, pull your
>> > wrist back so your hand is in waving position (palm facing forward) and
>> > twist it toward yourself and pull your arm away. It is hard to hold
>>onto
>> > wrist bones that are moving in that way. They stumble toward you and
>>you
>> > stumble back, so you can use that momentum to bring the same out and
>> > backhand them with your knuckles in the forehead, nose or teeth.
>> >
>> > >* If you are grabbed around the waist from behind, pinch the attacker
>> > either under the arm between the elbow and armpit or
>> > in the upper inner thigh HARD. One woman in a class this guy taught
>>told
>>him
>> > she used the underarm pinch on a guy who was trying to date rape her
>>and
>>was
>> > so upset she broke through the skin and tore out muscle strands - the
>>guy
>> > needed stitches.  Try pinching yourself in those places as hard as you
>>can
>> > stand it; it hurts.
>> >
>> > >* After the initial hit, always go for the groin. I know from a
>> > particularly unfortunate experience that if you slap a guy's balls
>> > (sorry to be graphic)it is extremely painful. You might think that
>>you'll
>> > piss the guy off and make him want to hurt you more, but
>> > the thing these rapists told our instructor is that they want a woman
>>who
>> > will not cause a lot of trouble. Start causing trouble, and he's out of
>> > there.
>> >
>> > >* When the guy puts his hands up to you, grab his first two fingers
>>and
>> > bend them back as far as possible with as much pressure pushing down on
>>them
>> > as possible. The instructor did it to me without using much pressure,
>>and
>> > ended up on my knees and both knuckles cracked audibly.
>> >
>> > >Of course the things we always hear still apply.  Always be aware of
>>your
>> > surroundings, take someone with you if you can and if
>> > you see any odd behavior, don't dismiss it, go with your instincts. You
>>may
>> > feel a little silly at the time, but you'd feel much worse if the guy
>>really
>> > was trouble.
>> >
>> > >Please forward this to any woman you know, it's simple stuff that
>>could
