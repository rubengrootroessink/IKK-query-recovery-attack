It looks like the entire EIS for the Hermiston Power Project is here.
However, I have yet to locate anything on the Chehalis Project
specifically. I have ordered hard copies of both documents from BPA and
they should be here by Monday, at which point I can make copies and send
them out.

Please look this over and let me know if it will still be necessary to
send hard copies. I will be happy to accomodate either way.
