February 22, 2001

+ THIS WEEK ...

Poets may be "the unacknowledged legislators of the world," as Percy
Bysshe Shelley once put it, but what of journalists? Well, in the
February and March issues of Harper's magazine Christopher Hitchens,
a columnist for The Nation and Vanity Fair and the author of a new
collection of essays on literature and politics entitled
*Unacknowledged Legislation*, has been making a bid of his own for
legislator -- or prosecutor -- status, arguing in his inimitable way
that Henry Kissinger ought to be indicted for crimes against humanity.

This week and next in Atlantic Unbound, James Fallows, The Atlantic's
national correspondent, engages Hitchens in an exchange of e-mail
correspondence about both the Harper's articles and the book -- with
its essays on such writers as George Orwell, Salman Rushdie, Norman
Podhoretz, and many others. To accompany the exchange, we're offering
two influential Atlantic articles by Seymour M. Hersh (a journalist
"legislator" if there ever was one) from May and December, 1982,
which went on to form part of his book *The Price of Power: Kissinger
in Nixon's White House*.

Also this week: a flashback to Charles C. Mann's report on the
Napster controversy from last September's Atlantic, new Unbound
Fiction, fresh ink from Sage Stossel, and more.

Cheers,

Wen Stephenson

THE HEAVENLY JUKEBOX
In last September's Atlantic, Charles C. Mann argued that most
coverage of the Napster controversy has missed some basic points.
Chief among them: the fight against Internet "piracy" is being led by
a peculiar and grasping business -- the recording industry -- that
should not be allowed to set the rules.

Readers respond to the review of Evelyn Waugh's *Sword of Honour*
