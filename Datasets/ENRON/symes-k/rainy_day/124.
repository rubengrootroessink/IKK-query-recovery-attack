+ THIS WEEK ...

"I joined the baboon troop during my twenty-first year. I had never planned
to become a savanna baboon when I grew up; instead, I had always assumed I
would become a mountain gorilla." So begins Robert Sapolsky's new book, *A
Primate's Memoir,* about the time he spent in Kenya's Serengeti over the
past twenty years, researching the stress levels of a troop of baboons.
This week, we're featuring an interview with Sapolsky, a professor of
biology and neurology at Stanford. Sapolsky's interests are wide-ranging,
and our conversation with him covers everything from the shadows
colonialism still casts on Africa, to the fallacy of free will, to why he
only rates as a "pathetically low-ranking baboon." We've also included two
excerpts from *A Primate's Memoir,* so you can get a sense of Sapolsky's
witty and lively prose.

Best,

A SIGN OF THE TIMES
by Joan Wilking
Apr 25 | "He's wearing one of Mom's old bathrobes, a cotton kimono, one she
and Dad bought on a trip to Japan. He's barefoot. He's been barefoot and
wearing the same kimono since I moved back in eight days ago. You can
believe me. I'm keeping count."

LOOKING FOR LEB RED
by Velisarios Kattoulas
Apr 25 | "When I arrived at the University of London in the late 1980s, the
thing to take to parties was Leb Red--not a charming French table wine, but
a pungent, murky brown hashish from Lebanon's Beka'a Valley. Regrettably,
my fellow undergraduates majoring in Japanese were a bit square--several
have since entered finance--and by the time I fell in with the
anthropologists, Leb Red was nowhere to be found."

Interviews
ROBERT SAPOLSKY: OF MONKEYS AND MEN
by Katie Bacon
Apr 25 | "For these baboons, stress is entirely socially generated, so they
really are good models for us. Study some marginal baboon population in
some dying ecosystem and it would not be anywhere near relevant to making
sense of which middle-aged executive gets heart disease. Our stress is
created by our privileged cocooning from ecological stressors; likewise
these baboons." The author of *A Primate's Memoir* talks about his years as
a member of a troop of Serengeti baboons.
