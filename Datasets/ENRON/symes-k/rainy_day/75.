Dear TurboTax Customer:

The status of your electronically filed federal tax return is now available 
from the IRS. You must view this status to determine whether or not the IRS 
has accepted your return.

To get your status:

TurboTax software users - Open your TurboTax program and we'll show you how 
to obtain the status of any returns you have filed electronically.

TurboTax for the Web users - Log on to TurboTax for the Web and we'll show 
you how to obtain the status of any returns you have filed electronically.


If the IRS has accepted your electronically filed return, TurboTax will walk 
you through the remaining tasks you must complete before the IRS considers 
your tax return officially filed and complete. Please follow the instructions 
in TurboTax carefully.

If your return is rejected, you must fix the errors in your return and 
retransmit your return for approval.

NOTE:  If you have filed a state return electronically, you will receive a 
separate email notification once TurboTax has received the status from the 
state taxing authority.

For more information on how to check the status of your return, please refer 
to the Help section of TurboTax.

Thank you for using TurboTax.

Please Note: This e-mail notification was requested by you when you prepared 
your tax return with TurboTax.
