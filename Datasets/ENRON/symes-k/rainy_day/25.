Hi Kate,

Can you please set up a conference call-in number for this Thursday afternoon 
4-5:30 pm Portland time for 4 different ports. 

Please e-mail the call-in number to me (also leave me voice mail please... as 
traveling I can't always access e-mail quickly), Dale Rasmussen, 
moconnell@stoel.com and ktakahashi@stoel.com.

Thanks Kate!!

If you have any questions you can reach me at the Hyatt in Houston (on 
Louisiana street) or on my cell phone.

Laura
