Kate,

If you would you, please start to draft a letter to the vendors for the 
solicitation of the raffle gifts?  We will probably need two letters, one to 
thank the vendor for their participation last year (I have the list of 
donated items) and another for new vendors that we will be soliciting.  

Here are a few points we need to make:

Thanks for particpating last year
Name the charity(s), a worthy cause type thing
State they are a current vendor in our system
The vendor name will be announced at the party, good advertising
Attach the article from last year

There may be more, but that is what comes to mind right now.  Since we will 
be using the merge feature we can insert the name of the vendor in the body 
of the letter.

Thanks!

Mollie
