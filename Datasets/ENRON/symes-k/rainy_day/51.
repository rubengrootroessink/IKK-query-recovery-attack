For all of you who have been inquiring about my recent reduction in
glasses...
Here is the web link to the doctor I used:

 http://www.willvision.com/html/index.html

As most of you know, I heartily recommend these folks based on my
procedure, and my results so far.

But I would also heartily recommend that you do what Kacia and I did and
research all of the LASIK processes out there, and attend competing
seminars discussing them.  We went to the Casey Eye Institute and to Will
Vision.  After attending both seminars, our choice was clear, but it would
not necessarily be the same decision for everyone.

If you have any questions for me - feel free.  I'm still amazed by the
whole thing!

- Clark.
