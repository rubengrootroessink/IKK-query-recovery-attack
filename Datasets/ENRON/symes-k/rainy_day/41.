Hope you all made it home in good shape.  All of us from Avista got back
pretty much on time.

Please accept our sincere thanks for hosting the three of us and our wives
this past week.  The Biltmore experience was truly unique and very much
appreciated by all of us.  The meals, rooms, and grounds were all
spectacular.  And then there was the SPA--my wife won't stop talking about
it!  She doesn't often travel with me, and certainly has never received that
kind of attention on any trip we've made together.

Thanks also for the golf; TPC is definitely the most noteworthy course I've
ever been on.  I have a lot of practicing to do before I go back.

All in all, it was great fun.  We were expecting it to be just that, but
once again you've exceeded our expectations.

Thanks,

Alan Meyers
