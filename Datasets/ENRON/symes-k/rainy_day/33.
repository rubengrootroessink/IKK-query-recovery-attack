We have recently had a deal control position become available in West Power 
Trading.  The main responsibilities of this position are:

To facilitate the entry of West Power deals into the trading systems 
including the Services Desk.
Follow-up with Deal Clearing Settlements groups in Houston to verify accuracy 
of trades in the system.  This includes timely follow-up with the traders for 
clarification. 
Ensure that all trades are entered by a daily deadline.
Calculate and report weighted averages of daily price and volume to Dow Jones.
Prepare and distribute daily reports to ensure all books are balanced and 
report discrepancies to management.
Track and report daily and monthly error discrepancies to management and 
deliver reports for possible solutions to rectify errors.
Calculate weighted averages between brokered trades and trades executed 
through EOL.
Report any technical mishaps to appropriate personnel in Houston and track 
computer problems until demonstrated resolutions.
Test any updated versions of applications requested by programmers and report 
back any adjustments needed.

If you are interested in this opportunity, please see Jeff Richter or Amy 
FitzPatrick by Friday, October 27th.

Thanks!
