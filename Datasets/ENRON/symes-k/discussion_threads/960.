Kate, I just faxed over the Constellation confirm just in case you need to 
view it. 

Thanks,

Kimberly

I've forwarded this message onto Christian Yoder, one of our lawyers. Chris 
Mallory and Jeff Richter suggested I check with Christian first on the 
language of these confirms. I'll get back to you first thing tomorrow.

Thanks,
Kate

Kate,
I received and index trade into NP15 that Chris Mallory did. For Price the 
confirmations states: 

The average day ahead, post congestion price for the Constrained Price as 
published by the California Power Exchange for the on in the period of 
delivery stated herein plus 3.00.

Is this language o.k. to accept on the confirmation.

Thanks,
