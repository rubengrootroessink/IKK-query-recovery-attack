Dear Miss Symes,

Thank you for inquiring about our program! a Complete information and
application package will be sent to the address specified in your request.
In it, you will find all the information about our school, our catalogue and
application form, and all the financial aid information and application
form. Please read the instructions carefully (especially for financial
aid--incomplete application for financial aid will NOT be considered).

Additionally, while waiting for your package to arrive by mail, you may also
wish to visit the Bologna Center website (www.jhubc.it). The school updates
the site regularly and in it you will find the most recent information,
including the dates and locations scheduled for the interviews
(www.jhubc.it/admissions).

The application Deadline was February 1, 2001. However, the admissions
office is currently still accepting late material.

If you wish to apply for 2001-02 Academic Year, you should download the
forms directly from the Bologna Center website
www.jhubc.it/admissions/appdownloads), fill them out and send them via
courier as soon as possible.


Information about scholarships are available on the website (also on the
"appdownload" page). Also, you will receive a list of institutions offering
fellowships together with you application package. Please note, however,
that resources are quite limited and the selection process very competitive.
Hence, we advise applicants to look for additional contacts themselves.

I look forward to receiving your application.
Best wishes and good luck!

Tommaso Wiechmann
