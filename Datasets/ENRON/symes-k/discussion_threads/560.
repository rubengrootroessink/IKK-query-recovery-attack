of electricity transactions. Kevin Sluder, Vice President, HoustonStreet 
Exchange.

considerations. Andrew Serri, Vice President, AmerenEnergy Marketing.

execution, reduced transaction costs, increased number and frequency of 
transactions and increased specialization are just some of the changes to 
energy markets wrought by the web, and it's just beginning. Implecations of 
the internet for energy markets. E. Russell "Rusty" Braziel, Chairman and 
Director, Altra Energy Technologies.
