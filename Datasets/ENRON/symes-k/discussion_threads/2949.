There are several unit contingent deals that don't have the unit name in the 
comment section.  Can you have them put in this information.  I know you sent 
us a reference sheet, but I think it would be better if the trader would 
specify the unit in the comment section.

Also, there was a deal on the no report this morning that looked to us like 
it probably should be confirmed.  Can you take a look at it and let me know?
