This deal was done on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). Jeff thought it 
was the same thing as Dynegy Direct. I've changed it to ICE as broker, but 
I'm wondering if these are different brokers, or why Jeff would have thought 
they were the same....???

Is Dynegy Direct the correct broker because I do not see this deal on their 
web checkout?
