I just signed this very important petition to the President and
Congress urging them NOT to allow drilling in the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge, our most magnificent wildlife sanctuary.  Drilling would
cause great harm to this wilderness area which is one of the few truly
wild places remaining.

Please go to http://www.savearcticrefuge.org,
add your name and pass it on!!!

Or you can add your name by checking out a great cartoon animation at
