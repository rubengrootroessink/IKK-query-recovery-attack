CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR SIGNS PLAN OFFERING INCENTIVES FOR ENERGY CONSERVATION

Gov. Gray Davis signed his long-promised electricity conservation plan into 
law Wednesday, saying the $850 million package should save thousands of 
megawatts and reduce the prospect of rolling blackouts this summer.

CALIFORNIA LEGISLATORS RENEW PLEA FOR POWER PRICE CAPS

Federal regulators Tuesday continued to rebuff California's pleas to cap 
wholesale prices charged by electricity generators. That prompted California 
lawmakers to push the state to seize contracts between generators and 
marketers to reduce the huge markup that has been passed on to ratepayers.

REPORT: PACIFIC NORTHWEST POWER PRICES TOP CALIFORNIA

Drought and a lack of aggressive regulatory oversight has pushed spot market 
prices for wholesale electricity in the Pacific Northwest even above those 
paid in California, the Seattle Times said Friday.

AVISTA UTILITIES APPLIES FOR 'NEGAWATT' PROGRAM

Avista Utilities, a unit of Avista Corp., asked the Washington and Idaho 
utility commissions Friday for approval of a program under which the utility 
would pay customers to reduce electricity use, Avista said. 

NYISO APPROVES 60-MEGAWATT INCREASE TO UPSTATE POWER LINE

The operator of New York's bulk electric grid said Friday it will allow the 
flow of power through an upstate transmission line to increase by about 60 
megawatts.
