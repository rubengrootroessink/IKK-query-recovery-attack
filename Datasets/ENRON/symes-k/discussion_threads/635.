ELECTRONIC TRADING. Power is following natural gas to become an 
electronically-traded commodity. The products, the technology and the future 
of electricity transactions. Kevin Sluder, Vice President, HoustonStreet 
Exchange.

NUTS AND BOLTS OF RETAILING. What it takes to put an energy retailing 
operation together-- the cash and credit requirements, back office, 
information technology, staffing, marketing, sales and organizational 
considerations. Andrew Serri, Vice President, AmerenEnergy Marketing.

transactions and increased specialization are just some of the changes to 
energy markets wrought by the web, and it's just beginning. Implecations of 
the internet for energy markets. E. Russell "Rusty" Braziel, Chairman and 
Director, Altra Energy Technologies.
