for some reason that contact was inactivated -if that's definitely the 
contact, i'll have gcp re-activate it.  that's strange, i wonder why  it was 
inactivated.  just let me know.

The contact name is Jack Wells, and his phone number is (281) 293-6030. Would 
you like me to enter this info into the deals?

Kate

hi kate,
these sean crandall deals need contacts.  can you please get a good contact 
name (and phone #) and i will put in a gcp request to have it added to the 
drop down list in deal entry.
i'm too lazy to press the shift key lately, sorry -no caps.
thanks for your help!
kim
