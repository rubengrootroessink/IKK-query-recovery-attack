electronically-traded commodity. The products, the technology and the future 
of electricity transactions. Kevin Sluder, Vice President, HoustonStreet 
Exchange.

NUTS AND BOLTS OF RETAILING. What it takes to put an energy retailing 
operation together-- the cash and credit requirements, back office, 
information technology, staffing, marketing, sales and organizational 
considerations. Andrew Serri, Vice President, AmerenEnergy Marketing.

RETAIL: WHAT WENT WRONG, HOW TO FIX IT. Retail electric deregulation has thus 
far been an underwhelming success, but a great deal has been learned, and it 
is eminently fixable. By Dr. John O'Brien, Principal, Skipping Stone

MANAGING BILLING. The complex requirements for managing billing and

Officer, Peace Software.

execution, reduced transaction costs, increased number and frequency of 
transactions and increased specialization are just some of the changes to 
energy markets wrought by the web, and it's just beginning. Implecations of 
the internet for energy markets. E. Russell "Rusty" Braziel, Chairman and 
Director, Altra Energy Technologies.
