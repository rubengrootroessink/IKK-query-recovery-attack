ELECTRONIC TRADING. Power is following natural gas to become an

of electricity transactions. Kevin Sluder, Vice President, HoustonStreet 
Exchange.

considerations. Andrew Serri, Vice President, AmerenEnergy Marketing.

is eminently fixable. By Dr. John O'Brien, Principal, Skipping Stone

the internet for energy markets. E. Russell "Rusty" Braziel, Chairman and 
Director, Altra Energy Technologies.
