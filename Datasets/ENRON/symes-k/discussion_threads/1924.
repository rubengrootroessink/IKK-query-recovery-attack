unprecedented crisis.? Blackouts, credit crunch, electric and gas price 
volatility, low hydro levels--? and we're not even near the summer.?? What 
are we facing??

Now is the time to think, to plan, to solve tomorrow's problems before they 
arise.?? Join us at the Power Marketing Association's Seventh Annual Spring 
Meeting: Power Markets 2001: CRISIS AND OPPORTUNITY:? MARCH 14-16, 2001, 
Aladdin Hotel, Las Vegas, NV. 

Crisis grabs the attention, but the opportunities are almost palpable.? Just 
click on the headline for the full story at powermarketers.com:

Federal Power Agency Issues Largest Wind Solicitation Ever?
The Bonneville Power Administration's (BPA) decision to solicit proposals 
Feb. 21 for 1,000 megawatts (MW) of new wind energy generating capacity is a 
"major breakthrough" for the increasingly-competitive clean energy 
technology, the Washingon, D.C.-based American Wind Energy Association? 
(AWEA) said today.

THE POWER OF PEAK SHAVING -- and LIFE-CYCLE COSTING
With peak-demand-controlled rates, businesses can realize as much as a 
60-percent discount on monthly demand charges if they agree to reduce the 
electric power demand to a predetermined level when the utility imposes a 
control period.

A POWER GRAB BY POLITICIANS
...Where power plants were to be built, or where high-voltage lines would be 
strung, might well depend on who could, and could not, bring political 
influence to bear, rather than what the system needed to work efficiently. 
...With the threat of further blackouts looming, legislation is being drafted 
to designate which customers will suffer and which will not -- ?Should 
farmers be cut off, or biotechnology facilities, or computer chip plants, or 
schools?

TAX LAWS REWARD ENERGY-SAVING INVESTMENTS
The Internal Revenue Service business energy investment credit is equal to 10 
percent of the cost (or basis) of energy-saving property -- equipment or 
facilities -- placed in service during the year.
