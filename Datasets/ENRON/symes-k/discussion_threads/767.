Many of you know that my wife, Sue, and I are expecting a baby any day now.  
When Sue stopped by the office on Tuesday, we were both pleasantly surprised 
by the wonderful gift basket and gift certificate to -- you guessed it -- 
Baby's R Us that the people on the floor gave to us.  The sage advise and 
warm wishes expressed on the card were particularly appreciated.  Thank you 
so much.
