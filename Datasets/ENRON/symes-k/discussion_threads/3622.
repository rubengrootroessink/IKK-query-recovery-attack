Help, I'm confused!  Yesterday I prepared a confirmation for three Montana 
Power deals, # 5467244, 597245, 597246.  I sent it to John Malowney and he 
approved it and I faxed it out. Today I noticed two of the deals have been 
killed and two legs added to the other deal.  I think it is the same deal, 
but can someone put notes into the deals saying what they did and why?

Thanks!
