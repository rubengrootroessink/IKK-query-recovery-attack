She doesn't have the signed confirm back yet. Sharen asked me about it a few 
weeks ago, and Holli told me she'd send it to the confirms group as soon as 
she got it. She's talking to her contact there right now to find out what's 
going on. I guess she's getting a little fed up of beating around the bush 
with these guys - so hopefully she'll get some concrete answers from them 
today. I'll let you know whatever we find out this afternoon.

Thanks,
Kate

Kate, can you please ask Holli if she has a copy of the following 
confirmation(s) Deal 420554.01, 420563.01 (probably confirmed together).  
Sharen Cason worked on the confirmation letter, but we never received a copy 
for our records.  Can you please send us a copy of the Confirmation Letter so 
we can properly scan the document in our system.  Thank you for your help.
