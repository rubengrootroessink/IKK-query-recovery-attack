I thought this was important information for you to have. 


RAPE   -   Self Protection 


Hi, girls!  I just finished taking the most amazing self-defense class, 
sponsored by Shandwick, and I wanted to share some really valuable info with 
you before it goes out of my head. 

The guy who taught the class has a female friend who was attacked last year 
in the parking garage at Westport Plaza in St. Louis one night after work 
and taken to an abandoned house and raped.  He started a women's group and 
began teaching these classes soon after.  This guy is a black belt in karate 
and trains twice a year with Steven Segall.  He and the others in this group 
interviewed a bunch of rapists and date rapists in prison on what they look 
for and here's some interesting facts: 

The #1 thing men look for in a potential victim is hairstyle.  They are most 
likely to go after a woman with a ponytail, bun, braid or other hairstyle 
that can easily be grabbed.  They are also likely to go after a woman with 
long hair.  Women with short hair are not common targets. 

The second thing men look for is clothing.  They will look for a woman who's 
clothing is easy to remove quickly.  The #1 outfit they look for is overalls 
because many of them carry scissors around to cut clothing and on overalls 
the straps can be easily cut. 

They also look for women on their cell phone, searching through their purse 
or doing other activities while walking because they are off guard and can 
be easily overpowered. 

The time of day men are most likely to attack and rape a woman is in the 
early morning, between 5 and 8:30 a.m. 

The number one place women are abducted from/attacked at is grocery store 
parking lots.  Number two is office parking lots/garages. 
Number three is public restrooms. 

The thing about these men is that they are looking to grab a woman and 
quickly move her to a second location where they don't have to worry about 
getting caught.  Only 2% said they carried weapons because rape carries a 
3-5 year sentence but rape with a weapon is 15-20 years. 

If you put up any kind of a fight at all, they get discouraged because it 
only takes a minute or two for them to realize that going after you isn't 
worth it because it will be time-consuming.  These men said they will not 
pick on women who have umbrellas, or other similar objects that can be used 
from a distance, in their hands.  Keys are not a deterrent because you have 
to get really close to the attacker to use them as a weapon. 

So, the idea is to convince these guys you're not worth it.  Several defense 
mechanisms he taught us are: 

? If someone is following behind you on a street or in a garage or 
with you in an  elevator or stairwell, look them in the face and ask them a 
question,  like what time is it, or make general small talk, I can't believe 
it is  so cold out here, we're in for a bad winter. Now you've seen their 
face and could identify them in a lineup, you lose appeal as a target. 

? If someone is coming toward you, hold out your hands in front of you 
and yell Stop or Stay back!  Most of the rapists this man talked to said 
they'd leave a woman alone if she yelled or showed that she would not be 
afraid to fight back.  Again, they are looking for an EASY target. 

? If you carry pepper spray (this instructor was a huge advocate of it 
and carries it with him wherever he goes), yelling I HAVE PEPPER SPRAY and 
holding it out will be a deterrent. 

? If someone grabs you, you can't beat him with strength but you can 
by outsmarting him.  If they grab your wrist, pull your wrist back so your 
hand is in waving position (palm facing forward) and twist it toward 
yourself and pull your arm away.  It is hard to hold onto wrist bones that 
are moving in that way.  They stumble toward you and you stumble back, so 
you can use that momentum to bring the same out and backhand them with your 
knuckles in the forehead, nose or teeth. 

? If you are grabbed around the waist from behind, pinch the attacker 
either under the arm between the elbow and armpit or in the upper inner 
thigh.  HARD.  One woman in a class this guy taught told him she used the 
underarm pinch on a guy who was trying to date rape her and was so upset she 
broke through the skin and tore out muscle strands - the guy needed 
stitches.  Try pinching yourself in those places as hard as you can stand 
it.  It hurts. 

? After the initial hit, always go for the groin.  I know from a 
particularly unfortunate experience that if you slap a guy's   balls (sorry 
to be graphic) it is extremely painful.  You might think that you'll piss 
the guy off and make him want to hurt you more, but the thing these rapists 
told our instructor is that they want a woman who will not cause a lot of 
trouble.  Start causing trouble and he's out of there. 

? When the guy puts his hands up to you, grab his first two fingers 
and bend them back as far as possible with as much pressure pushing down on 
them as possible.   The instructor did it to me without using much pressure 
and I ended up on my knees and both knuckles cracked audibly. 


Of course, the things we always hear still apply.  Always be aware of your 
surroundings, take someone with you if you can and if you see any odd 
behavior, don't dismiss it, go with your instincts.  You may feel a little 
silly at the time, but you'd feel much worse if the guy really was trouble. 

Please forward this to any woman you know, it's simple stuff that could save 
her life.
