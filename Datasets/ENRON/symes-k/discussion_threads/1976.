530608 - CDWR - Bob Floyd @ (916) 574-2768
531786 - Metro Water of SoCal - Jim Danielson @ (213) 217-6673

This should be the contact information in GCP. If it's not in there, let me 
know and I'll have it added.

Thanks,
Kate

Hi Kate!
I can't find any contact info. in GCP for these counterparties (California 
Dept. of Water Resources, Metro. Water Dist. of Southern Cal., and Atlantic 
Richfield Co.)  Can you give me contact names and phone numbers so that i can 
get a verbal confirm on these deals?
Thanks,
Kim H.
