Hi guys.  I just talked to Willie in Houston and thought I'd pass along what 
he told me.

He said that the Index prices are going to be automated probably by the end 
of this week (that means no more manual entry).

If we have problems with the numbers in EnPower, contact Willie Harrell at 
6-853-9226
If we have problems with the numbers in Unify,  contact  Kelly Lombardi at 
6-345-8491

They are also training a girl named Jenny (? last name). 

Thanks for all your help last week, Kate.
