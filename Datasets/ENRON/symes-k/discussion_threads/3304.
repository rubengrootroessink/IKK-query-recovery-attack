Kate I will have to submit a code change to our Enpower guys to reflect the 
$15.00 flat fee change for 1 or 2 days deals.  Currently this can't be coded 
based on the duration of these deals because we currently have a code for 
daily deals(meaning 1 day only) and a code for short term deals ( meaning 
anything 1 day or more but less than 1 month) and a code for long term deals 
(meaning anything more than 1 month).   If the fee was per mw, I could simply 
go and edit the broker table fee but since this is a flat fee, the codes have 
to be adjusted to reflect such.

I have submitted a request and I am waiting on a response.  I will keep you 
updated.
