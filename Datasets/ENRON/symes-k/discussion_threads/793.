Kate, I believe all taken care of.   I looked in audit viewer and it looks 
like tom changed/flipped the prices.  Thanks for following up.

I just wanted to check in with you before changing these deals, since it's 
been a few days since your e-mail. Tom Alonso wasn't in the office today and 
I tried reaching him by phone to confirm. These are the prices he has in his 
trade log, so as far as I can tell they are correct. Are you saying that 
these prices need to be switched? Please let me know, and I'll fix it right 
up.

Thanks,
Kate
