UPS and FedEx shipping forms have been created.  Hooray!  Using these forms 
will help us meet your shipping needs. 

Where to find them?
The forms may be found in their labeled black trays next to Erin's desk or on 
the network path: 
P: \Admin Assistants\Forms\UPS request form or FedEx request form.

Easy as 1-2-3
1.   Fill out a form and attach it to each item you need shipped.   
2.   Place item in top black tray.....put oversize items on floor between 
Erin and Emily's desks.
3.   Turn your item in before the daily 4pm deadline.  
       It will be your responsibility to label and ship any overnight items 
that do not meet the 4pm deadline.

FYI:  All interoffice mail is shipped overnight FedEx.  

 



Please let us know if you have questions.
Thank you!  

Emily and Erin
