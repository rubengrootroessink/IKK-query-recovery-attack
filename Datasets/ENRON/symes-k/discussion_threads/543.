night at 9 pm.

Subject: December 8th changes and needs for more

Geir and Bill,

OK,

At MidC we are -2 on LLH,  we also show a 2 mw buy from MPC at Hotsprings.  
If we used transmission for this, we need to put it in.  Did you use our 
existing Benton?

Then all that we will have left is 16 mw's open for HE 23-24 at MPC system,  
and 2 mw's for the same hours at Mid C (SCL deal)

I reduced the EPMICALPOOL deals by an equal amount, and that gets us balanced 
all the way.
