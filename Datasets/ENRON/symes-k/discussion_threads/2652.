Skippy
They call him Skippy, Skippy, faster than lightning, 
No-one you see, is smarter than he, 
And we know Skippy, lives in a world full of wonder, 
Flying there-under, under the sea! 
Everyone loves the king of the sea, 
Ever so kind and gentle is he, 
Tricks he will do when children appear, 
And how they laugh when he's near! 
They call him Skippy, Skippy, faster than lightning, 
No-one you see, is smarter than he, 
And we know Skippy, lives in a world full of wonder, 
Flying there-under, under the sea!
