 I thought you would get a kick out of this speech that Larry Ellison (Oracle 
CEO) gave at Yale University to the Graduating class of 2000.
What follows is a transcript of the speech delivered by Ellison at Yale 
University last month:

 "Graduates of Yale University, I apologize if you have endured this type of 
prologue before, but I want you to do something for me. Please, take a good
 look around you.  Look at the classmate on your left. Look at  the classmate 
on your right.  Now, consider this: five years from now, 10  years from now,
even 30 thirty years from now, odds are the person on  your left is going to  
be a loser. The person on your right, meanwhile,  will also be a loser. And
you, in the middle?  What can you expect?  Loser. Loserhood. Loser Cum Laude. 
In fact, as I look out before me today, I don't see a thousand hopes
for a bright tomorrow. I don't see a thousand future leaders in a thousand 
industries. I see a thousand losers. 

You're upset. That's understandable.After all, how can I, Lawrence "Larry" 
Ellison, college dropout, have the audacity to spout such heresy to the 
graduating 
class of one of the nation's most prestigious institutions?  I'll tell you 
why. Because I, Lawrence "Larry" Ellison, second richest man on the planet, 
am a college 
dropout, and you are not. Because Bill Gates, richest man on the planet-for 
now anyway-is a college dropout, and you are not. Because Paul Allen, the 
third richest
 man on the planet, dropped out of college, and you did not. And for good 
measure, because Michael Dell, No. 9 on the list and moving up fast, is a
 college dropout, and you, yet again, are not. 

Hmm ... you're very upset. That's understandable. So let me stroke your egos 
for a moment by pointing out, quite sincerely, that your diplomas were not 
attained in vain. Most of you, I imagine, have spent four to five years here, 
and in many ways what you've learned and endured will  serve you well in the 
years ahead. You've established good work habits. You've established a 
network of people that will help you down the road. And you've established 
what will be lifelong relationships with the word "therapy."  All that of is 
good. For in truth, you will need that network. You will need those strong 
work habits. 
You will need that therapy.  You will need them because you didn't drop out, 
and so you will never be among the richest people in the world. Oh sure, you 
may, 
perhaps, work your  way up to #10 or #11, like Steve Ballmer. But then, I 
don't have to tell you who he really works for, do I? And for the record, he 
dropped 
out of grad school. Bit of a late bloomer. 

Finally,I realize that many of you, and hopefully by now most of you, are 
wondering, "Is there anything I can do? Is there any hope for me at all?" 
Actually, no.
It's too late. You've absorbed too much, think you know too much. You're not 
19 anymore. You have a built-in cap, and I'm not referring to the 
mortarboards on your heads.  

Hmm .. you're really very upset.  That's understandable. So perhaps this 
would be a good time to bring up the silver lining. Not for you, Class of 
'00. You are a 
write-off, so I'll let you slink off to your pathetic $200,000-a-year jobs, 
where your checks will be signed by former classmates who dropped out two 
years ago. 
Instead, I want to give hope to any underclassmen here today. I say to you, 
and I can't stress this enough: leave. Pack your things and your ideas and 
don't 
come back. Drop out. Start up. For I can tell you that a cap and  gown will 
keep you down just as surely as these security guards dragging me off this 
stage are keeping me dow..." 

(At this point The Oracle CEO was ushered off stage.)
