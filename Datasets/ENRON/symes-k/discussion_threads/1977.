Sharen,

Kate Symes asked me to email you and let you know that we do verbal confirms 
with Valley Electric.  We speak with Valley quite often, and confirm deals 
with them over the phone.  We have never sent them paper confirms, and we 
would like to keep the relationship the way it is.  If you have any questions 
please feel free to contact me.

Thanks,
Stan
