Kate, I don't know if you've received any response, but new counterparty 
requests should be directed to the Global Counterparty group.  In this case, 
Sam Schott should be able to help you as he does requests for alpha S-Z.  
Bernice Rodriguez is his back up.  I set up Enron entities.

Thanks,

Cheryl x33103

Subject: New CTPY Name Request

Because I'm not quite sure who to direct this request to, I'm e-mailing 
everyone I think might be involved in entering new counterparty names. One of 
our mid-marketers has executed a deal with Sierra Pacific Holding Company, 
which is a new counterparty name and needs to be added as a choice in 
Enpower. Please let me know if I've contacted the correct people, and if I've 
contacted the incorrect people. (Sorry!)

Thanks,
