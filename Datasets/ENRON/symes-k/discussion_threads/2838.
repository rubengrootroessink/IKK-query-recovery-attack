I will be out of the office on Friday, attached is the spreadsheet of the 
differences noted so far between EES & EPMI and where we are with them.  
Since the GL needs to be booked by the end of the day Wednesday I am sending 
this file to everyone.  Please take a look and let me know if more 
information is needed.

Kate you asked about deal #553219.1 EES shows this deal on the 16th at a 
price of $125.  They do not see this deal on their real time sheets for the 
19th. 

 

Thanks,

Mark
