Attend the Power Marketing Association?s annual spring meeting:

          POWER MARKETS 2001: CRISIS AND OPPORTUNITY

                March 14-16, 2001 Las Vegas

http://www.pmaconference.com/0103Agenda.pdf

EVERY CRISIS HOLDS OPPORTUNITIES:

Power shortages boost merchant power, distributed generation, peak shaving, 
real-time pricing and energy management. Some states are delaying their 
retail choice programs, but others are moving ahead, confident that they have 
benefited from the lessons learned by the pioneering jurisdictions. Electric 
price volatility drives growth in the risk management business.

Credit and cash flow are squeezed, but financial products provide solutions. 
Gas price volatility is a reminder-- coal was and remains the great source of 
energy for our country. Dot-coms seem to have been exposed as just ordinary 
businesses-- but online trading in energy is the single most robust area for 
transactions on the net. The IPO market hasn?t been kind to technology 
stocks-- but it likes energy issues. Broadband trading has been slow to take 
off, but powerline telecom may solve the real problem-- access to "the last 
mile".

Please join us at the Power Marketing Association?s annual spring meeting, 
"POWER MARKETS 2001: CRISIS AND OPPORTUNITY" March 14-16, 2001 Las Vegas, for 
presentations on these topics and more!

Warmest Regards,
Glenn Lovin
Executive Director

ELECTRONIC TRADING. Power is following natural gas to become an 
electronically-traded commodity. The products, the technology and the future 
of electricity transactions. Kevin Sluder, Vice President, HoustonStreet 
Exchange.

NUTS AND BOLTS OF RETAILING. What it takes to put an energy retailing

information technology, staffing, marketing, sales and organizational 
considerations. Andrew Serri, Vice President, AmerenEnergy Marketing.
