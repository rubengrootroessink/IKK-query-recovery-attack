Kate,

If you log in as myself, you can pull up the EOL JF Report that you were 
using originally.

Subject: EOL Summary - Still Under Construction

I'm continuing to work with IT in Houston in an attempt to restore the EOL 
Report to its former glory. They are making several changes to the report 
which seem to result exponentially in glitches. As of right now the 
application will not create any kind of file with any kind of data; hence the 
absence of any kind of report. I will keep you informed of our progress.

Thanks for your patience,
Kate
