Kate, same thing on this trade. I think it should be FPL Energy Power 
Marketing b/c I received a confirm on it. Secondly on the confirm it states 
that hour 0100-0600 is priced at $95.00 and then again at hours 2300-2400. 
7-22 is priced at $140. However I do not show in the system 1-6 and 23-24 at 
$95. Did he forget to put in the off peak or is FPL incorrect.

Thanks,
