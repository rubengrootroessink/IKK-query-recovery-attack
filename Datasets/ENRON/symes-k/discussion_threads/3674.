Hello there!

I'm researching a problem our Settlements group has run across, and it looks 
like it might be due to a Cal-PX index price that didn't get posted. The 
terms of the deal are as follows:

508956
EPMI sells to EES
NP-15
1/31/01 - Round-the-Clock
Price - PX NP-15 index

Apparently when the deal was first calculated in our system (on 1/31), the PX 
index price had not been posted yet, and consequently our Risk group 
calculated the deal at the trader's curve price. Then
