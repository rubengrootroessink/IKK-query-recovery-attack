I just wrote on our confirm that we are in agreement to trade date 12/4/00 
per Matt Motley and faxed it back to Powerex for the records and kept fax 
transmittal, and sent it off for filing.  Just letting you know.  Thanks

I've changed the term to 12/4, and I'm going to make a note in our daily deal 
correction report that this was due to a late report from EES. Thanks for 
catching this.

Kate

Kate, below is the EES spreadsheet that has the shows the powerex trade shown 
on 12/4/00.  Please verify and we can backdate the trade and reconfirm the 
document, or we can initial Powerex change and send back to them to show that 
we are in agreement.  Thanks Stephanie
