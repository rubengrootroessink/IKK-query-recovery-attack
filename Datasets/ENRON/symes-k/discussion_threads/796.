Yes, please change to be confirmed.  The only thing you might need to do is 
tell the schedulers because you might get a message that warns that you will 
unroute this deal.  They just need to know about it.  Let me know.

Thanks!

This was Stan Cocke's deal, and since he just transferred into mid-marketing 
from real time, he's not used to putting the confimation request into his 
deals. This should be confirmed; but since the deal has already flowed, I 
wanted to check with you before changing anything. Please let me know.

Thanks,
Kate

This deal is coded not to be confirmed, but it flows longer than 6 days which 
is the criteria for creating confirmations.  Can you check with the trader, 
and if it should be confirmed, get a contact and let me know.

Thanks!
