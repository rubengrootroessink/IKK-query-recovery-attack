REMINDER:

The ClickAtHome Portland Road Show is TODAY! Please see below for details.

Note that the 8am and 10am info sessions are still open for 
participants--feel free to drop by!

Also, please note the following changes:
The afternoon session will begin at 1:00pm, rather than 12:00pm
PC ordering will take place in Mt. Rainier from 1pm-5pm.
And, in order to keep the "flow" of traffic moving through Mt. Hood, please 
plan on viewing the PCs at the top of the hour (1pm, 2pm, 3pm, etc.).



If you have any questions, please let me know.

Regards,
Grace
