Hey Kate,

For 4/15 and 4/16, our schedules that we sent you show a Riverside 
Generatioin component of 0.8 every hour (SP15).  This is not reflected in 
your current April update.  The EnPower columns for these days should be 
increased by 0.8 for every hour.  Right?

Also, The generation component that I sent you for Wednesday and Thursday 
(which I sent Monday morning) had a generation component of 0.8.  In reality, 
it was actually 0.55.  I didn't have the generation schedule from Riverside 
and had to assume a value so I assumed it would be 0.8 because that's where 
it had been for a while.  In your current file, you have the correct value of 
0.55.  How did you know this?  Did Riverside call you to tell you they were 
at 0.55 instead of 0.8?  Let me know.  Thanks.

Dan
