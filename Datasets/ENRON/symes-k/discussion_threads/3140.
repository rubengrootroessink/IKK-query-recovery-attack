Kate,

We are out of balance for 04/10/01.  We are long1600 mws(100 per hour) on 
peak in NP15.  This is not an hourly deal, and there were no cuts.  Also deal 
#574882 was entered in SP-15 under ST-Whourly...I zeroed this deal out.  I 
appreciate you trying to flatten us out, but please check with me before 
putting in deals under the ST-Whourly book...

Thanks,
Bill
