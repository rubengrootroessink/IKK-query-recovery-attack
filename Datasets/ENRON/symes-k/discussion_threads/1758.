Let's start over: 


ISSUE 1-Mike Swerzbin
deal 524248 and deal 524266
This two deals checkout with Amerex fine.  Amerex has one deal at 50 mw and 
we have two identical deals at 25 mw.

deal 524247
This deal checks out with Amerex fine.

The deal that I am missing is Enron buys from EES 25 mw of off-peak Mid-C for 
Q3'01 at $285.95.


ISSUE 2- Mike Swerzbin
deal 524267
 Amerex has 50 mw and we have 25 mw.

ISSUE 3- Dianna Scholtes
deal 523984
Amerex has price as $345 and we have price as $335.


This has been a terrible ordeal and I will be so glad when everthing is 
resolved!!!

Thanks
Evelyn

I am missing the following deal:
Enron buys from EES 25 mw of off-peak Mid-C for Q3'01 at $285.95. - 524248 - 
part of a spread sleeve done with EES and El Paso - only one broker fee 
agreed upon - fee included on deal 524247 NOT 524248


Thanks,
Kate
