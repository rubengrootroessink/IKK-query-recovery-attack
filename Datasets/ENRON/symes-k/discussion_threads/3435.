I have attached the updated version of this document and it can also be 
accessed on the O drive at
O:dcd/powerdoc/kimberlyH/not to be confirmed deals.doc

I left Bonneville Power Administration in Red because I would like to 
research that one a little further.
Please let me know if you have anything to add.  Thanks for your help!
