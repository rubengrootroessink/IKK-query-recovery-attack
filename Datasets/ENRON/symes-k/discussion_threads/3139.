?TOP STORIES

CALIFORNIA OFFICIAL SPARS WITH U.S. ON POWER POLICY

As California and other Western states grid for a summer of energy shortages 
and rising electricity costs, the chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission said that the Bush administration would do everything possible to 
ease the problem, except give California what it wants the most - price caps 
on wholesale fuel costs, The New York Times reported Tuesday.

CALIFORNIA'S POWER STRUGGLE DRAGS ON AMID HIGH PRICES, SHORTAGE OF ELECTRICITY

The way they lambasted each other for PG&E's plunge into bankruptcy Friday, 
Gov. Gray Davis and the utility's top executives sounded like innocent 
passengers on the Titanic, seemingly powerless to prevent it from sinking.

FPL GROUP PLANS NEW NATURAL GAS-FIRED ALABAMA PLANT

FPL Group Inc.'s FPL Energy LLC unit plans to build, own and operate a 
624-megawatt, natural gas-fired power plant in Calhoun County in northeastern 
Alabama.

E. ON, POWERGEN DEAL WILL CREATE SECOND-LARGEST UTILITY

E.ON AG unveiled plans to take over Powergen PLC for 8.2 billion euros in 
cash and assume 7.1 billion euros in debt, a deal that would create the 
world's second-largest electricity-service provider and strike one of the 
boldest moves yet to consolidate Europe's newly deregulated power industry.

AS DEMAND GROWS, INSUFFICIENT ELECTRIC LINES COULD CHOKE OFF POWER IN MIDWEST

Energy insiders are talking a lot among themselves this spring about the 
coming power squeeze caused by overloaded electric transmission lines.

TRANSALTA BEGINS CONSTRUCTION ON $210-MILLION US POWER PLANT IN PACIFIC 
NORTHWEST

TransAlta broke ground today on the site of its $210-million US ($310-million 
Cdn) 248-megawatt (MW), natural gas-fired combined-cycle power plant near 
Centralia, Washington. Washington Gov. Gary Locke joined Murray Nelson, 
TransAlta's executive vice-president Generation, at the plant site to dig the 
first spade into the ground for the Big Hanaford Project.
