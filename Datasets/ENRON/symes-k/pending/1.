I know this is way before your time, but ------
Our contact at EES is calling and asking for a copy of the confirmation for 
this deal.  We never prepared one because it was coded not to be confimed.  
Can you check with the trader and see if anyone up there remembers if this 
was confirmed as part of something else or why it was marked not to be 
confirmed or anything else about it.

Thanks!
