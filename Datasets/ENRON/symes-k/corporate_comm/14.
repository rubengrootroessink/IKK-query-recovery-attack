Good Morning,

Over the last couple of weeks, we've made several recent additions to the 
Portland IT applications team.  We hope that with this new influx of talent 
we will continue to "raise the bar" for IT support of Enron's trading 
activities in Portland.

Richard Schweiger is our new Senior Applications Specialist. He comes to 
Enron through RHI Consulting where he contracted at Enron for the last 2 
months and has now converted to full-time.  Richard has several years of 
Visual Basic and C++ programming experience. He has been living in the 
Portland, Oregon area for the past 4 years and is originally from 
California.  His current projects include migration of the California 
Pre-Trade application to the intranet as well as building strong middle tier 
architecture to support the new CAL-Web development.

Michael Tully is our new lead Trading Floor Support analyst.  He recently 
moved from Oklahoma where he was the Lead Help Desk Support for Electronic 
Storage Corporation.  Mike's wife is due with their second baby in January.  
Outside of work, Mike love's to scuba dive.  Mike is currently working for 
Comsys and hopes to eventually convert to full-time.  Mike is replacing 
Wendella Rhoads who recently moved back to Eugene to be closer to family.

Dan Maxwell is a new contract developer from Maxim consulting working on the 
California Pre-Trading application.  Dan currently lives in Boise, Idaho and 
commutes to Portland during the week.  Dan spent the previous year commuting 
to Washington DC developing software for GEICO insurance company.  He is 
originally from Miami, Florida where the beach is the place to be but 
counting is a lost art.  

Paul Kane has recently transferred from the IT infrastructure group to the IT 
applications group to work on SQL support and development.
 
On a sadder note, we will be losing Winston Goodbody on December 18th to a 
six month cross-country skiing trek across Wyoming.  Winston has been 
contracting at Enron for the last year and a half and will be sorely missed.

Thanks,  David Poston
