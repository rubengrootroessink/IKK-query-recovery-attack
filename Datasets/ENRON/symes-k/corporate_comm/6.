Welcome to the Official PGE PARK NEWSLETTER.  This newsletter has been
created by Portland Family Entertainment (PFE) to give you an insider's
view on PGE PARK, the home of the Triple A Baseball Portland Beavers and
A-League Soccer Portland Timbers.

For more information, please visit our web site at www.pgepark.com, or
call the Ticket Hotline at (503) 553-5555.

PGE PARK CONSTRUCTION OVERVIEW
When PGE Park is completed next spring, event patrons may be surprised
to see the magnitude of this exciting renovation.  In partnership with
the City of Portland, PFE will manage a $38.5 million renovation of the
former Civic Stadium to enhance fan enjoyment standards, meet modern
design codes and honor the historic character of this 1926 landmark.

Soon to be the premier outdoor event venue in the region, PGE Park will
feature:

*  New convertible playing surface, adaptable to all events.

*  New baseball dugouts and bullpens.

*  Major League Baseball field dimensions.

*  Vintage style wrought-iron fence along 18th Ave. allowing passerby a
view of all PGE Park events.

*  New seats and wider concourses.

*  New restrooms and baby-changing stations.

*  New concession stands and kiosks with improved menu options.

*  Fred Meyer Family Deck featuring an old-fashioned soda fountain.

*  Yet-to-be-named Widmer field level bar and grill, featuring grills
and full beverage service.

*  Affordable Pavilion Boxes, Field Boxes and Club Seats for
high-quality corporate entertainment.

*  State-of-the-art sound system and new theatre organ.

*  Americans with Disabilities (ADA) Compliance.

*  Current seismic code compliance.

*  ... and much more!

PGE PARK CONSTRUCTION UPDATE
Virtually every area of the construction site is currently under
construction.  From elevator pits and structural elements to field boxes
and underground utilities, it's all coming together for our Spring 2001
opening.

The main concourse along 20th Avenue (the first base side), demolished
during the Portland Rockies' season last summer, is re-emerging as a
wider, lowered concourse.  Steel beams and metal decking are being
placed for a major concrete pour in the near future.  This will be the
most visible reconstruction element to date in the project.

Concrete has already been poured at the field level in the area of the
new soon-to-be-named Widmer Bar and Grill.  This field-level area will
have both an open air patio and a space built under the seating bowl for
a true early 1920's bar feel.  Selecting your favorite bar stool for a
view of the game is only a few months away!

We will soon be adding a Construction Update Photo Gallery to
www.pgepark.com.  We will keep you posted on when this exciting feature
is added.  If you would like to receive photos as an attachment, please
email us at info@pgepark.com.


PFE NAMES TRIPLE-A AND SINGLE-A BASEBALL TEAMS
After an outpouring of fan feedback, Portland Family Entertainment went
with tradition when they announced that the Triple-A Baseball Pacific
Coast League club will be called the Portland Beavers.

"Baseball is a game deeply rooted in tradition," said Mike Higgins, PFE
vice president and Beavers general manager, who made the announcement.
"The name and logo will also integrate well with the nostalgic look and
feel that PGE Park will have when it opens next spring."

Portland Family Entertainment also announced that it has named its
Northwest League Single-A Baseball Team the Tri-City Dust Devils.
Formerly the Portland Rockies, the Dust Devils will begin play in the
Tri-Cities Stadium in Pasco beginning summer 2001.

PFE partnered with the Marathon Media Group of Tri-Cities to conduct a
poll and contest of their radio listeners to select the team name.
Respondents were able to vote on the Marathon Media web site.
Richland's Rosalie Swanson was selected at random, from the many Dust
Devil entries, as the grand prizewinner of two club-level season tickets
for the team's inaugural season.

VANCOUVER'S RICK SWEET NAMED BEAVERS MANAGER
The San Diego Padres didn't have to search far to find the right guy for
the job as today Vancouver, Washington resident, Rick Sweet, was named
manager of the Pacific Coast League's Portland Beavers.  The Padres also
announced other additions to the Beavers staff including Darrel
Akerfelds as pitching coach; Roy Howell as coach, and John Maxwell as
the club's trainer.

"We felt it was important to hire a manager that had significant
managerial experience," said Tye Waller, Padres' director, player
development.  "It was also important for us to hire someone who had ties
to the local community.  That's not always an easy combination to come
up with, but we clearly achieved that in hiring Rick.  Rick, Darrel and
Roy have all played in the big leagues and that experience will be a
tremendous asset in the development of our younger players.  In John we
have a first class trainer and will do a terrific job in looking after
our guys."

Sweet has 12 seasons of experience as a minor league manager and was
named Pacific Coast League manager of the year in 1994, while managing
the Tucson Toros as they defeated the Portland Beavers for the PCL
championship.  He joins the Portland's new Triple-A team from the
Montreal Expos where he served as their minor league field coordinator
for the past two years.  During the 1998 season, Sweet managed the
Double-A Harrisburg Senators to the Eastern League title.

Sweet also reached the majors as a switch-hitting catcher with the Mets,
Seattle Mariners and Padres.  He made his major league debut on April 8,
1978 with the Padres.  Sweet homered in his first Kingdome at-bat after
joining Seattle in 1982.


CONWAY NAMED TIMBERS ASSISTANT COACH
The Portland Timbers have named former player, captain, and coach, Jimmy
Conway, as assistant coach for Portland's new A-League soccer club.
Through an agreement between the Timbers and Oregon Youth Soccer
Association (OYSA), Conway will continue to serve in his current role as
OYSA's director of coaching, a position he has held since 1982.

"Jimmy was my first choice for the position of assistant coach and I am
delighted that he was available to join our staff," said Timbers head
coach, Bobby Howe.  "Not only is he an outstanding member of US Soccer's
National Coaching Staff, but he also has a first class international
playing background.  I also want to recognize and thank OYSA for their
spirit of cooperation in allowing us to 'share' with them Jimmy's
knowledge and experience.  I think it will be a great benefit for our
professional players and Oregon's youth soccer players."

Prior to coaching, Conway had an outstanding playing career making 20
caps for the Republic of Ireland from 1966-1977.  As a midfielder,
Conway made over 300 appearances for Fulham in England's First Division,
where he scored 66 goals for the Cottagers.  In 1976, he transferred to
Manchester City of the English Premier League before joining the Timbers
in 1978.  He was named captain of the Timbers in 1979 and was promoted
to the position of player-coach in 1980 by then head coach, Don Megson.
He retired from playing professionally in 1982.
