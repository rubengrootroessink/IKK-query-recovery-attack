Hi!

Joe Hunter will be taking my place for now until a replacement is found. His 
phone number
is 713-853-3316. We will be faxing your matchups to you once we receive them 
from EDF Man.

Thanks
David

Dave -
I'm the new Deal Control staff person here in the Portland office, and I've 
been told you're the person to contact regarding counterparty match-ups for 
our futures deals this month.

The futures were done today, and if you could let me know of the 
corresponding counterparties as soon as you find out, that would be very 
helpful. If there is anything I should know about your job or how we might 
help each other work better, please let me know.

Thanks a lot,
Kate
