For those of us in Enron Americas, the following is for your information.

I contacted Eric Thode, Director of Public Relations, to ask when we should 
start converting our business cards, letterhead, envelopes, etc., to say 
Enron Americas.  He was traveling at the time he received my message but had 
Jennifer Walker in his office call me back.  Eric recommended we use Enron 
Americas when ordering anything new with the company name on it from this day 
forward.  He thought work was being done on the "big announcement" about 
getting the name changed on everything, and he would contact me next week to 
discuss.  When I hear anything new, I'll let you know.

Contact me if you have any questions.
