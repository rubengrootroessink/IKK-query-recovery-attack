I'm forwarding your message to the group here -we all wanna give you a big 
hug!  I never really said anything to Carla because I liked working with her, 
but that was always kind of a sticking point with the folks here in Houston 
-she never would tell us when something was changed so we would always have 
to run extra reports to make sure that we caught everything that might have 
gone into pending.  It wasn't a huge deal, but it certainly helps if you 
wanna drop an email or give us a call to let us know when anything changes 
-that's how we do it here; everyone knows to tell documentation when they 
revise any deals.  Also, don't forget to put notes in anytime you change 
anything in Deal Entry to CYA.  So glad to have you and I can't wait to meet 
you!
Not sure how good a tan you're gonna get around the New Year, though.  I 
could let you know about some good tanning salons while you're in town (j/k).
Thanks again!
Kim

She didn't "warn" me that you were cheesy, but she did mention you were a 
peach too! And anyway, I love cheesy e-mails.

But since I'm writing, I might as well mention that I have a deal that was 
changed last night by one of our traders, and I think it needs to be 
re-confirmed. It's deal number 476435 - Mark Fischer caught his own error and 
changed the delivery point from Palo Verde to Mid-C. 

And speaking of confirms and all that good stuff, that's one area I was never 
really told about; so if you or anyone else in your group has any information 
to share - anything that I could do to make your jobs easier or to make our 
jobs synchronize better - PLEASE let me know. I'm very humble about how much 
I have to learn, so the more people teach me, the better.

I believe I'll be coming down to Houston after the new year to meet people, 
tour the place, and get a suntan! So if you don't want to call or e-mail with 
every detail, you can compile them all and give me the run-down when I'm 
there. Whatever works for you guys - just let me know.

Thanks a lot,
Kate
