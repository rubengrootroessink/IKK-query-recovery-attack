Kate,

You wrote:
"Question #2 - The third choice says "Neither party can more than the
other." I'm not sure if I understand this, or if there's a word missing.
Question on the supply and demand on textbooks, parts B and C. One questions
states "What price does not seller receive?" Again, I'm not sure whether you
mean the price that the seller does NOT receive or if "not" is an mistakenly
placed word."

I am sorry about the typos.  I will give you credit for those problems.

Scott
