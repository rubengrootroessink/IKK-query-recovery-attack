Dear PMA Reader:

We've arranged with the publisher of the weekly newsletter, The Desk, to 
redistribute a copy of it's current Special Topic Issue, free to PMA 
subscribers. This week, The Desk goes beyond the realm of weather-based or 
other exotic derivatives and digs deep into the possibility of a market for 
solar (or space) weather derivatives. And more specifically, how they might 
be used in the power business. It's a fascinating topic and one that should 
be on everybody's radar screen. Enjoy the free issue.


Regards,
The Staff of the PMA
