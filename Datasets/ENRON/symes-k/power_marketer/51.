February 12, 2001:
Crisis and Opportunity Update

If you're like the tens of thousand of others who read the Power Marketing 
Association's Daily Power Report, you know that our industry faces 
unprecedented crisis.? Blackouts, credit crunch, electric and gas price 
volatility, low hydro levels--? and we're not even near the summer.?? What 
are we facing??

Now is the time to think, to plan, to solve tomorrow's problems before they 
arise.?? Join us at the Power Marketing Association's Seventh Annual Spring 
Meeting: Power Markets 2001: CRISIS AND OPPORTUNITY:? MARCH 14-16, 2001, 
Aladdin Hotel, Las Vegas, NV. 

Crisis grabs the attention, but the opportunities are almost palpable.? Just 
click on the headline for the full story at powermarketers.com:
 
SENATE PANEL PROBES EMERGENCY NATURAL GAS ORDER?
A Senate committee on Friday sharply questioned the way a Cold War-era law 
has been used to keep California's natural gas flowing.???Use of the 1950 
Defense Production Act to compel suppliers to sell to financially strapped 
Pacific Gas and Electric Co., California's largest utility, was a legal 
stretch that could theoretically leave taxpayers holding the bag, said Sen. 
Phil Gramm, R-Texas.

CRAIG HYDROELECTRIC POWER BILL TO STREAMLINE LICENSING PROCESS
With an energy crisis that is quickly seeping out from California to Idaho 
and other western states, the Senate is considering legislation that would 
streamline the licensing of hydroelectric power plants.?? The bill would 
place FERC back at the helm of the licensing process, reinstating its 
authority to balance environmental and corporate interests under the Federal 
Power Act. 

WESTERN LEADERS TALK ENERGY GOVERNORS SEEK TO SPEED POWER PLANT CONSTRUCTION
Facing an energy crisis expected to worsen by summer, 10 Western governors on 
Friday asked the Bush administration to streamline environmental regulations 
in an effort to speed construction of new power plants.? The request came as 
Western leaders meeting in Portland predicted California-style blackouts 
could plague the drought-stricken Pacific Northwest this summer unless the 
federal government intervenes immediately.

 CAPSTONE LAUNCHING GENERATOR SALES PUSH POWER SHORTAGE CREATES MARKET
Moving to capitalize on California's energy crisis, Capstone Turbine Corp. 
said Wednesday it is launching a subsidiary to serve that market while 
boosting the staff that sells its innovative power generators.

 NEW POWER PLANTS NEEDED QUICKLY
Hoping to stave off summer blackouts, California will dramatically speed up 
the approval process for new power plants in hopes of adding electricity for 
5 million homes by July, Gov. Gray Davis said Thursday.?? Under an executive 
order, Davis said the state will cut red tape and give bonuses to small power 
plants that operate only during peak hours of the day, provided those 
facilities can be up and running by summer.
