Good Afternoon,

The IT shop in Portland now has a new Bat Phone to contact IT 24 hours a day 
7 days a week.  Please call us at

503-464-7376

and this number will ring at the production support phones during work hours 
or inform you of the on-call pager number during off-hours or weekends.  
As always, we still love walk-up visits and direct phone calls, but if there 
is ever a question of who to call, this number is always available.


Thanks,  IT Production Support
