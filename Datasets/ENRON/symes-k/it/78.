    All ext tables should be deleted by triggers ( Enpower-PWR#401 )
    Tantra said the triggers are in TESTN, I can not see them because of my
    permissions. I can trace the problem if I get more info which is the 
database
    instance and what is the error message.

      Thanks,
      Kroum

Kroum,

Users are having difficulty deleting term strips in Deal Entry due to the 
existence of deal_strip_setlmt_ext records.  Is Deal Entry supposed to delete 
these records explicitly or are we supposed to have a trigger in place to 
handle this?

Thanks,
Will
