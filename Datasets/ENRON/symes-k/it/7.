We were experiencing problems with our DS3 connection to Houston.  The 
Networking Team had switched us over to the T1 lines while they figure out 
where the problem is occuring.  I will keep you updated on any changes.

If you have any questions or concerns please feel free to contact me.

Thanks,
Diana
