Kate, no problem at all, I just wanted to give you and Cara a chance to look 
at it too.  Thanks,

Brett -

I'm so sorry for not sending you an e-mail last night! I did test the report 
and it looks just fine - but I had so many things going on right up until I 
left that I forgot to tell YOU that it looked fine. Thanks for the reminder, 
and for your work on the report.

Kate

Kate, were you able to test the Fwd Obligation Report?  Mr. Luu is ready to 
push it in to production, but we wanted you to look at it and give it your ok 
first.  

Thanks,
