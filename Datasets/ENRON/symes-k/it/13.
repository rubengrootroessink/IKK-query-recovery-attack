Hi Kate,

I hope you had a Happy New Year's.

Sorry we forgot to include you on the initial email.  Could you please 
coordinate the User Acceptance Testing with your group for the various 
reports that were listed below?  As Laura explained, those reports were 
changed to include a field necessary for those deals that came from an  
External Exchange (Houston Street, Dynegy Direct, True Quote) through EOL.

Thanks for all your help.   Please let Laura or myself know if you find any 
problem with the reports.
Nadine.
(713)853-9863.

Hello.  Hope everyone's holiday was pleasant!

Nine reports have been promoted to Stage and are in need of User Acceptance 
Testing.  These reports have not been changed except to add a field that 
allows you to filter in or out the external exchange information, if the deal 
was brought into EnPower via EOL via an external exchange, such as Houston 
Street or True Quote.  EOL is scheduled to start adding these deals very soon 
and we want you to be ready.

To test the reports, please enter deals into the system and add your own EOL 
number, use the dropdown to pick an External Exchange, and add your own 
External Exchange number.  Then you can track your deal through the system.

I have attempted to identify who would normally use these reports, but if I 
am inaccurate, please just reshuffle them to the appropriate party.  And let 
me know where I am wrong so I can make a note for next time.  Also, I do not 
have a list of which reports the Portland office might use so please just 
test the ones you do use.
