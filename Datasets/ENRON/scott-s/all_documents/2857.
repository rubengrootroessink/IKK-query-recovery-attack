Thanks to all of you who participated in the Associate & Analyst Programs 
survey and PRC focus groups.  We appreciate your input and the feedback is 
essential for the program's success.  

We have received the analysis from Watson Wyatt regarding the survey.  At 
this time the Office of the Chairman is reviewing the results and working 
with program management to formulate an action plan.  Once this review is 
complete the results of both the survey and the PRC focus groups will be 
communicated to you.  In addition, any action items will be addressed at that 
time.

Thank you again for your participation and continued support of the Associate 
& Analyst Programs.
