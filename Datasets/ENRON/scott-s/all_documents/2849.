Also Susan, as you will soon be rotating, please take this opportunity to 
fill out an evaluation form on your current rotation.  This form will enable 
the Program's Career Development department to monitor many things such as 
quality of work, business unit culture and knowledge gained within your 
rotation. 

You will be pleased to know that your input will be used to staff new summer 
and full time employees.  We will also be able to identify any potential 
areas of improvement within the business units.  The Career Development 
department will be able to provide valuable information and compare rotations 
amongst business units.  This information will be provided to Commercial 
Staffing Leads and business unit leaders.

Remember, it is an opportunity to be heard.  Please complete the attached 
form and return to me via email or inter office mail.  If you would like this 
to be anonymous, please leave off your name but be sure to include your 
rotation information.  Thanks so much.
