nosegay (NOZ-gay) noun

   A small bunch of flowers.

[Middle English : nose, + gai, joyous, ornament.]

   "My nosegays are for captives;
   Dim, long-expectant eyes,
   Fingers denied the plucking,
   Patient till paradise.

   "To such, if they should whisper
   Of morning and the moor,
   They bear no other errand,
   And I, no other prayer."
   Emily Dickinson.

This week's theme: words from poetry.

............................................................................
The least initial deviation from the truth is multiplied later a
thousandfold. -Aristotle, philosopher (384-322 B.C.)
