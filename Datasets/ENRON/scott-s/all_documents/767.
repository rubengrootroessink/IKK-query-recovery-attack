Hi Susan! 

Speaking french! Tres bien!? Actually, we just got back from France 
yesterday.. had a good time. I? hope you had? wonderful holiday.

I will call and check.. I am not sure.? I believe I may have to cancel to get 
my deposits back for the gas and electric... I am disputing something on my 
phone bill which should be cleared up by the next bill but in case it is? 
not, it might be confusing.

If transferring works well, I would be happy to do so.? You are welcome to 
give him my email address and maybe we can work something out.

Thanks for cleaning... it is fairly clean (minus the floor in the bedroom and 
the small study... stopped sweeping because it got really dark).? 

I just need to empty out the refrigerator (only a few items are in there... 
one or two which I would like to keep) and remove the curtains (from the 
bedroom).? I think I am going to keep the rod in, if that is okay, as to not 
tear up the walls or cause a need for repainting.

I will send you the address shortly... Let me know if there is anything else 
that would help!

Hi Ashley!? A couple of things.? First of all, my new renter, Doug, wonders 
whether he can just call the utilities & phone and transfer from his name 
to yours (rather than you cancelling and him having to pay any re-hookup 
fees that may apply).?? I don't know how it would work; maybe he could 
conference you in when he makes the calls.? For what it is worth, he is a 
very nice guy to deal with, but it is totally up to you and I really don't 
care one way or the other. 

Also, I'm having someone come clean the place so you needn't worry about 
it, in case you were wondering.? I will take care of it (it looks pretty 
clean anyway!). 

Please let me know your new address and I will send you your deposit refund 
next week. 

Merci! 

Susan
