Could we change the date to Tuesday, December 12th?  So far, I have two votes
for a girls party with a gift exchange.  Email me back about the new date and
your opinion on restaurant choices and type of party.

Thanks!!  Happy early Thanksgiving!

Lisa-You are so cute!!!  I love both of your fun ideas. Either one is great
with me.  Considering my man in a million miles away I may have to come
stag!!!!  As far as the date (calendar date)I am actually leaving town on
the 13th.  I know I am probably cause trouble, but if we could do it maybe
earlier that week.  I know you working folks have office parties etc. so
this might not be possible and it might be hard to get people to go out on a
Mon or Tues.  These are just my thougths!!!!!!  Can't wait to see everyone!
Sarah
