Attached is a list of footnotes we have come up with for the transactional 
report.  Can you review the list and make any necessary wording changes.  
Also, if there are any footnotes we have left off please feel free to add 
them.
Could you please review as soon as possible.  We need to get this list to the 
system folks ASAP!
The notes in red are courtesy of Rita!

Thanks

Linda
