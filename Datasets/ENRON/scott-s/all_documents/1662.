Shorty,

I hope your day is going well and your trader and thus you are having a good 
day.  I just realized that I broke the "rules" last night.  I should say no 
to a Friday night out when asked out on Wednesday night but I'll let it go 
this time because we are going country and you are breaking out the t-shirt 
and jeans.  When I think about it, that exception applies to every 
situation.  I had fun last night and I think you will be relieved to know 
that I can't get my huge belt buckle on order and shipped in time for 
tomorrow so you are in the clear.

Ted
