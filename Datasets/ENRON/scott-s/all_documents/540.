Subject: marketing affiliate filing

After speaking with several of you about the standards of conduct filing 
(Standard L changed), here is my summary of what has/hasn't been done.

For NNG, no tariff sheets need to be changed at this time.  The tariff 
currently states that NNG does not share marketing employees with its 
marketing affiliates.  The tariff also states that the only shared facility 
is the Houston office.  Both of these items are still true.  The EES employee 
on 2 in this building is not considered an employee of an NNG marketing 
affiliate.  As far as compliance with the posting requirements on the 
internet, all affiliate information, job descriptions, organization charts, 
and corporate structure are available.  I talked with Toby today about an 
indicator when the information is updated.  The web site currently does not 
have a specific date as to when the information was last updated.  The 
organization charts have a date in the left hand corner to indicate the date 
the chart was put together which would change as the chart information 
changed.  Dari, to be in compliance with Standard L, does Toby need to add an 
indicator showing when the information was last updated?  Also, it is my 
understanding that Dari will put together the filing letter.

For TW, tariff sheets will need to change to reflect that they are sharing 
office space with their affiliate in Albuquerque and in this office building 
with the EES employee on 2.  The posted information for TW would be the same 
as for NNG so the question still exists as to whether Toby would need to add 
an indicator of when the information was last updated.  Would Mary be 
preparing the tariff sheets and Maria preparing the letter?

In a copy of a Tennessee filing that Maria gave me, Tennessee proposed taking 
the marketing affiliate information out of the tariff completely because it 
wasn't possible to meet the "update within 3 days" requirement stated in 
Standard L through changing tariff sheets.  Instead, Tennessee will have this 
information on their website.  The order accepting their filing came out 
August 23rd.  Is this of interest to anyone?

Please let me know if I have left out anything.  Thanks.
Ranelle
