   "The whole spirit of Hallowe'en is, of course, one of `spooky' gayety and
   light-hearted ghastliness. Witches and ghosts run riot; corpses dance and
   black cats howl. `More work for the undertaker' should be the leitmotif
   of the evening's fun."
   Donald Ogden Stewart, Perfect Behavior, George H. Doran Company, 1922.

This week's theme: words from the German language.
