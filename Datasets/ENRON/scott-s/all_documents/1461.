Hi Susan!  How are you?  It was so good seeing you when I was in Houston!  I 
really had tried to find out your e-mail address b/c I've often wondered what 
your were up to.  I'm glad to hear your enjoying work.  Are you happy to be 
back in Houston?  (I guess you've been back for awhile now...)  How's your 
family?  Do you still talk to Emily?

I've visited Houston every so often to see Ryan...I still always have the 
greatest time when I visit.  I'm trying to decide right now where I want to 
live.  I have the flexibility with my job to live wherever I choose, so I've 
been thinking about LA.  I'm torn though b/c I like Houston, too.  I'm 
thinking about just playing in LA for about a year and then probably settling 
down in Houston.  We'll see...

What else is going on with you?  Are you dating any one?  Do you still keep 
in touch with any Kappas?

Well, sorry for all the questions, but I can't wait to hear from 
you...hopefully, we can stay in touch!

Take care, Bronwyn
