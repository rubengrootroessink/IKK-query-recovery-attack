I hate these things, but one never knows....

Don't laugh at this! Just do it!
My best friend just did this, this morning, wished for her promotion and
just got a call and she got it.






I'm SO sorry about this, but I had to keep it going. The last time I
sent
this exact e-mail out, I got a new job and now I'm superstitious.

Start thinking something you really really want, cause this is
astounding...
the person that sent this to me said their wish came true 10 mins after
they
read the mail so I thought what the heck.

You have just been visited by Dr.Suess's Cat in the Hat. He will grant
you
one wish.
Make your wish when the count down is over.

10..










9..










8..









7..










6..









5..










4..

1..










MAKE A WISH




Send this to 10 people within the hour you read  this.
If you do, your wish will come true. If you don't it will become the
opposite.










=====
IF I DON'T SEE YOU:  GOOD DAY, GOOD AFTERNOON AND GOODNIGHT!!!
