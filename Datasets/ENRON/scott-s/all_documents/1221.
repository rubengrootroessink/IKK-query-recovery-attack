THE TURKEYS TALK - Holiday tips from the OneTravel.com Experts

Holiday travel is arduous at best but some planning and mental programming=
=20
can save your sanity.

By now, you have your tickets for Thanksgiving travel (unless you are going=
=20
to travel on Thanksgiving Day) and should be booking soon if you are=20
traveling over the Hanukkah, Christmas or New Year's holidays.  This done,=
=20
consider the following tips as your travel travails begin.  We all agree th=
at=20
the easiest way to make holiday travel better is to be flexible and keep a=
=20
positive mental attitude.  While the latter may be hard at times, just step=
=20
back and take a deep breath.  Confrontation will only make things get worse=
. =20
You can always be "right" later.

1) Packing and pre-shipping ideas:

With a bit of planning, you can travel with just one wheeled carry-on and a=
=20
small carry-on bag for an overnighter or a two-week trip.  No lost luggage,=
=20
no mis-routed or stolen bags.  And if you miss a connection, you can rebook=
=20
and hop on another plane with all of your baggage in tow. For extra comfort=
,=20
replace your shoulder bag strap with a padded golf bag strap, or consider=
=20
using a backpack with two straps to balance the weight evenly. Feet can=20
suffer during travel, so make sure to wear your most comfortable shoes to t=
he=20
airport.

Visualize your luggage as a box full of air;  all you need to do is fill up
the air spaces in the most compressed manner.  Rolling or folding and
overlapping clothes works best.  Place socks and underwear into shoes, and=
=20
fill every available space.  Miniaturize your toiletries by pouring small=
=20
amounts of shampoos, lotions and other necessities into re-usable plastic=
=20
travel bottles; you can pack these in a fraction of the space. Pack only=20
wardrobe essentials.  Plan to dress in neutrals -- tans, grays, blacks, wit=
h=20
some white or accent color -- for versatility and saved space!  Pack with=
=20
plastic bags to keep clothes from wrinkling.

If you are taking Christmas gifts or a special Thanksgiving dinner treat,=
=20
consider UPS, Airborne, FedEx and the like.  The items will arrive ahead of=
=20
you, and there's no chance of them being crushed in the overhead bin by=20
someone who doesn't know what's inside!

If kids are part of your entourage, make sure that they pack their own smal=
l=20
bag of carry-on toys and games to keep them occupied.  Pack snacks and a=20
surprise in your carry-on for them as well. When traveling with children,=
=20
travel early with your longest leg over their nap time.  The "white noise" =
of=20
the plane, train or family car will lull them to sleep and give you a chanc=
e=20
to catch your breath as well.

Most airlines have increased their charges for pets in the cabin and baggag=
e=20
hold. It may cost you between $150 and $300 to take your pet along for the=
=20
holidays.  Consider a kennel stay, or have a neighbor care for your pet whi=
le=20
you are gone.  Travel, especially by air, can be very traumatic for your pe=
t.


2) Getting to the airport or train:

Strongly consider public transportation such as a taxi or an airport=20
shuttle.  If a friend owes you a favor, now is the time to cash it in.  The=
=20
airport lots will be full, and if you don't allow enough time, you may pani=
c=20
while you circle the lot looking for a spot.


3) At the airport:

The Air Transport Association is expecting record numbers of travelers this=
=20
Thanksgiving holiday. Even with these numbers, there are things you can do =
to=20
help make your trip as hassle-free as possible.

Plan to arrive at the airport at least two hours before your scheduled=20
departure. Leave for the airport early enough to allow extra time for=20
increased airport traffic, parking trouble and longer luggage check-in and=
=20
security screening lines.  With most airfares, you can stand by for an=20
earlier or later same-day flight, so if you are at the airport early, there=
=20
is always a chance you can get out of town on an earlier flight. Note: If y=
ou=20
do not have advance seat assignments, you may want to arrive at the airport=
=20
even earlier.

Make sure all baggage has your name on the outside. If you do not have a=20
baggage identification tag, the airline will provide you with one.

Have your photo identification ready for the agent at check-in.

Although most airline rules read that they may cancel your reservation if y=
ou=20
are not at the departure gate ready to board at least 10 minutes before=20
departure, don=01,t press your luck.  Plan to be at the departure gate read=
y to=20
board at least 30 minutes before departure.

When it is time to board =01)- board! The plane may not move until everyone=
 is=20
seated and all carry-on baggage is stowed. Keep it simple: Board the plane,=
=20
stow your stuff, sit down and buckle your seat belt.

Although the airlines tell us that it is not necessary to reconfirm return=
=20
domestic flights, we do and we recommend you do, too.  As soon as you arriv=
e=20
at your destination, contact the airline to reconfirm your return flight an=
d=20
leave a phone number where you can be reached.
