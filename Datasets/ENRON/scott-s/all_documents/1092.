WHITE (LABEL) XMAS:  With our special White Label fares, flexible travelers 
can save up to 80 percent off published airfares this holiday travel season!  
When you opt for a White Label fare, you will not learn airline and flight 
specifics until after you purchase your tickets. (This protects our major 
airlines from tipping off the competition!) But you'll land a great flight 
for your requested itinerary and save much-needed cash for fruitcakes, party 
hats and stocking stuffers!

New White Label fares are added into and updated in the Farebeater system at 
http://air.onetravel.com on a daily basis. White Label flights are 
automatically offered to you when availability matches your requested 
itinerary. Currently OneTravel.com offers thousands of White Label flights, 
in conjunction with 8 million consolidator airfares and over 20 million 
regular published fares -- but number of White Label fares in the system 
depends on availability from the airlines.

Here's how to search for White Label availability:
? Click to http://www.onetravel.com.
? Search flights for any dates -- even New Year's Eve!
? Wait for Farebeater to locate an initial fare.
? Now click on Farebeater Ultra for White Label fare options.
? Farebeater will offer White Label fares if they match your city pair 
selection.
? Book and save!

HOLIDAY HUMOR: Holiday travel taxes our nerves, frustrates our good 
intentions and tires us out -- but it also brings us together with loved ones 
and gives us a few good stories to tell.  We're looking for a few humorous 
stories to remind people to relax during the hectic holiday travel season and 
hear the ha-ha-ha's amidst the ho-ho-ho's.  Do you have a favorite holiday 
travel memory that might bring a smile to our readers' faces?  An airport 
foible, a road-trip mishap, a holiday lesson learned?  Send your submissions 
to editor@onetravel.com by December 22, 2000. (Please restrict the length of 
your story to 250 words.)

Selected entries will appear in upcoming holiday newsletters, and winners 
will receive a OneTravel.com t-shirt in a size big enough for Santa or small 
enough for his helpers.

buying these promotional items anyway.  Contest ends January 15, 2001, but

THE TURKEYS TALK AGAIN - Holiday tips from the OneTravel.com Experts

Holiday travel is arduous at best, but some planning and mental programming 
can save your sanity. Our OneTravel.com Experts, Nancy Zebrick and Bob Jones, 
offer some tips and general advice which we hope will help you pass through 
your gates in great physical and mental shape.

Statistically speaking, airplane travel is the safest way to get from one 
point on the globe to another.  Yet some travelers still step onto the plane 
with fear.  It may not be easy to overcome this trepidation, but as Nancy 
explains, it's best not to self-medicate with in-flight cocktails.

Alcohol triples its effect in flight and causes serious dehydration, says 
Nancy. Skip it and drink lots of water; 32 ounces for a long hour flight is 
not unusual. Try to keep to your normal eating schedule while in flight and 
bear in mind these rules of thumb:

1) High-fiber carbohydrates seem to have better effect than fats and even
protein in keeping the amount of air that is produced through digestion to a 
minimum. Fruit and yogurt are good sources of carbohydrates and vitamins; 
consider packing some for the first leg of your flight.

2) Eat small portions to ensure proper digestion.

3) Avoid salty foods!  They can bloat you and cause your feet to swell.

5) Forget carbonated beverages -- the gas expands at high altitude. Fruit and 
vegetable juices are better alternatives. Also avoid tea and coffee, as they 
are
both diuretics and can dehydrate you even more.

6) Always bring a bottle of water with you. The airline may run out.

Once you reach your arrival city, adjust your eating schedule a bit to comply 
with the time change.


Anytime you sit in one place for over an hour, especially at high altitude, 
your body experiences problems. You may notice swelling in your lower legs 
and feet as your circulation is reduced.  Veteran flyer Bob Jones offers tips 
to solve your in-flight woes:

Try the two-step method. First, wear support hose on long flights and second, 
step. Step out of your seat and walk the aisles. If you cannot get up and 
move about, do your best to stretch and move your legs as much as possible.  
For those in the over-50 group, it is also very important to move the rest of 
your body. Simple shoulder shrugs and neck rotation along with arm and back 
stretching will do wonders for your well-being. Some basic isometrics or just 
shifting your position in your seat helps. Bottom line is this, if you sit 
still for three or four hours, it will take its toll as you get up to leave 
the airplane.

Stretch before, during and after the trip. Elevate your feet if you can. 
Hydrate your skin with lotions and moisturizers to prevent dryness, says 
Nancy.  The best time to apply moisturizer is when there is still moisture in 
your pores -- so start before you board! And try to wear larger, more 
comfortable shoes at the airport and in-flight.  Because of the altitude, gas 
in the body will cause slight swelling.

If you are traveling with kids -- as Bob often does -- remember that they 
need to move, too, as well as be occupied during the flight. Kids tend to be 
able to sleep on long flights since they can curl right up and go to sleep in 
a coach seat.  And, Bob says, since they are more rested than you, try not to 
be too short with them. Always bring activities and order special "Kids 
Meals" which are now available on virtually all carriers. Activities should 
be age appropriate, and if you are bringing electronic games, make sure they 
are quiet or that the sound can be turned off. Be sure to include manual 
activities like coloring, connect-the-dots and word finders. And finally, 
even though the world is shrinking, remember to bring a favorite snack for 
the outbound and return trip.  Your kids' favorite snack may be hard to find 
in another state or country!

Congratulations! You have managed to control your mental and physiological 
stress between the gates -- and your kids are happy, too!

Happy Holidays and Happy Travels,
From Nancy and Bob
