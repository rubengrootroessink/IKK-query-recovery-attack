> Craig -- Attached is a summary of the changes we would like to see in the
> SoCal Settlement proposal regarding the receipt point access rights at
> Wheeler Ridge.  I believe this is more market responsive, by letting the
> market decide the split of Primary Access Rights at Wheeler Ridge.
>
> Additionally, we are concerned with the market perception of the relative
> values of the two packages, as SoCal has defined them.  The market would
> place much greater value on the W.R.-North capacity (becasue of the
> secondary market value of the flexibility).  This would be purchased even
> by
> shippers desiring only K-M access; thereby limiting the perception of the
> quantity / quality of receipt point capacity access to PG&E and  OXY.  I
> would be happy to discuss this further.

> Please feel free to share any comments you have with SoCal and other
