Hi Susan !
?
This is Bobby Gerry writing to say hello. It was  fun meeting you at Downing 
Street this past weekend.
I wanted to drop you a line before I head off for  the holidays, and I hope 
you have a great Christmas!
I am going out to San Francisco on Wednesday to  spend Christmas at Mom's 
place and I'm going to be out there through New Years  as well.
It would be fun to do something after the busy  holiday season ends. I'm glad 
you got to meet Julie Maxey the other night. She  and her husband Steven are 
really great. ..I'm starting to see more and more  that energy is a SMALL 
world here in Houston!
Anyway, I hope things are good with you and have  a great holiday!
Bobby
