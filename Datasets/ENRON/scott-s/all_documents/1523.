Peter Principle (PEET-uhr PRIN-suh-pal) noun

   The theory that an employee within an organization will advance to his
   or her level of incompetence and remain there.

[After Laurence Johnston Peter (1919-1990).]

   "To me, Randell personified the Peter Principle, a popular management
   theory of the 1970s which held that you rise to your level of incompetence
   - in other words, you keep getting promoted till eventually you find
   yourself in a job that's beyond you."
   Karl Du Fresne, Sleeping better thanks to Blackadder, The Evening Post,
   May 31, 2000.

This week's theme: syndromes, paradoxes, laws, and principles.
