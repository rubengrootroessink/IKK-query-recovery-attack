Hello Susan--

Great idea to initiate the email correspondence--I have a huge exam tomorrow,
and then I won't have internet access until December 22nd or so, so I just
wanted to let you know that an email with more detailed information will be
coming your way soon.  After my test tomorrow, I'm leaving for the
holidays--I'm going to meet Carter's family (the boyfriend you've apparently
heard about), and then we're going skiing with a bunch of friends from med
school until the 21st, so I'll email more when I get back!!  It was great to
hear from you!!

Love,
Elizabeth
