ENERGY
        Philosophers search for truth in much the same way that artists
do. They don't really expect to find any definite answers. They mainly want
to provide and investigate more ways of looking at the world. But scientists
differ slightly. Science strives to provide very definite, measurable and
provable truths. In the back of their minds though, scientists understand that
those truths are only temporary, and that they may very well be replaced
someday by another truth. So they're really not so different from artists
and philosophers after all.

        Einstein's Theory of Relativity has been accepted as a scientific
truth. But it has so far not been found to mesh with quantum physics. It
may very well be that the 21st century will modify one or both of those
truths as well. So for the time being, we can look at energy as mass times
the speed of light times the speed of light. From another point of view,
energy is the capability of a body to do work or produce an effect. It's
possible that the second definition will outlast the first.

In words as fashions the same rule will hold,/ Alike fantastic if too new or
old;/ Be not the first by whom the new are tried,/ Nor yet the last to lay
the old aside. -Alexander Pope, poet (1688-1744)
