HI Susan-

I'm totally open to whatever works best for you, truly.? That would be fun to 
have all day Saturday, and I'm really not worried about leaving you a key 
under the door mat or waking up to greet you- we can work it out.? Whenever 
you want to leave on Sunday is fine with me, too.? I'm not doing much to help 
you make a decision, I know, but I want you to do whatever is easiest and 
most comfortable for you.? I remember you having to get up at the crack of 
smack to come out here on Saturday; sometimes it's easiest to stay up later 
rather than getting up earlier!? I have virtually no plans that weekend now, 
so I'll start thinking about what fun events are occurring that weekend....We 
should go out downtown to the Gaslamp quarter, too, since we didn't get to do 
that last time.? We'll plan on Saturday evening for that.? I'll gather some 
friends....

Hope you're having a good day!
Julie

Okay, so here's the debate...There's a flight out Friday night leaving
Houston at 11:00 pm and getting into SD around 2:20 in the morning.? The
next earlier flight leaves Houston around 5:30 pm but unfortunately there's
no way I could make that one because of? work.? The other option is to fly
in Saturday morning like I did last time.? I'm leaning towards leaving
Friday night and just taking a cab to your place as long as you don't mind
waking up to let me in.? That way we'd have all day Saturday to do things
and I wouldn't leave on Sunday until around 3:30 (or I could even leave
around 6:00).? Anyway, I was just wondering what you think about the
various options?? Let me know and I'll try and book this thing today.

Susan
