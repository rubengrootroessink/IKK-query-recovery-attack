Miranda or Estalee ( but probably Miranda as I think Estalee is out today),

Could you please provide more information for Dave, Gary and Lisa:

New/Old Job titles.
New/Old Payroll companies.
Effective date of transfer.
Date person accepted the job, if know.

Actually, I will need this information for every transfer.
Also, could you please send every notice to Shelley, me, Susan Scott and Dari 
Dornan.
That way, the appropriate attorney can pick up their own people.  Also, we 
can back each other up.
Thanks!!

Frazier
