Susan, looks great. I have a few suggestions ; simple words and
format. We can review tommorrow. The only area I saw that we did
not address, I think we should is the Item 7 (secondary transmission)
market. The Commission is focused on this area of in state develop
ment, we should take advantage.  I will be faxing copies of
previow testimony for your background and use in our testimony.

Thx, Mark IGS
