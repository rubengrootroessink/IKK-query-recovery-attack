Hi, Sooz

Just returned from the Workman Gallery to pay for the painting--which, by the
way, I really like.  It's so nice to know you like something immediately and
don't have to sneak up on it for another look to make up your mind!  Anyway,
I was asking Wally about her gallery--she's been in business for 20 yrs, and
I'm sure in that time there were some really bad times for her here in
Austin.  I was telling her about you, and she said the woman who owns Sloan
Jordan Gal. in the arboretum is an attorney here in town, and is sure she
must have a business manager to run the place.  (Gail or Gayle something.)
Anyway, she said we should call her and invite her to lunch so you could talk
with her.

K, J & G are coming in Sat. for Karin's haircut.  Always anxious to see
Grayson.

Hope our tickets to "Chorus Line" are good.  I'm really looking forward to
it.  The performance starts at 2:30--a decent hour for you to get here.  We
can go out for drinks and dinner afterward.

Glad your painting turned out well.  Looking forward to seeing what a
difference it makes.  Have a good weekend.    love, mum
