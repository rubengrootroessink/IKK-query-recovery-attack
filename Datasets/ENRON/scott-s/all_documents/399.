I am puzzled by the discrepancy too.  I was not planning to do anything
about the exhibit, other than refer to it in my brief.  Let me know if you
find out what SoCal says about the possible errors. Mike

Mike -- I've had conversations with Jeff Dasovich and Mark Baldwin about
the exhibit SoCal filed because we feel there might be a mistake or at
least some confusion.  See footnote 5, then add up the columns.  For some
reason that is not readily apparent, SoCal seems to have not counted
Mojave's capacity at all in the first column but added it in twice in the
last column.  I have a call in to Brian Cherry to get clarification and
have promised Jeff I'll get back to y'all when I hear from him.

Out of curiosity, are you planning to file anything in support of the
exhibit?  I am inclined not to because I don't think it is really
necessary.
