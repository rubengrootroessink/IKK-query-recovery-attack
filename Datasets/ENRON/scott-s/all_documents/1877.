The A/A Department is officially working with SAP.

SAP requires a new expense reimbursement form.

From now on, if you need cash back from our department as a result of any 
recruiting efforts, (Super Saturdays, On Campus Visits, etc.) please use the 
attached form:



As usual, send the form and taped-to-separate-sheets-of-paper receipts to 
Randy Martin (EB 3621) for coding and processing.
