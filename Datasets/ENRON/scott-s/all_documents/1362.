Did you ever hear the saying, "Give me ambiguity or give me something else?"

Subject: Ambiguity

This was sent talking about political correctness but thought it was an
example of ambiguity that you've had....

Subject: RE: A.Word.A.Day--syzygy

Regarding today's word of the day, also please note that syzygy is the
longest word in the English language the letters of which, used in any
combination, do not form a single other word.

Subject: Syzygy

My father used to give me a word a day when I was little. Once he gave me
syzygy. In Kindergarten when Sister Mary Angela told us all about the
dictionary, she told us we could look up any word. Even Dog or perhaps Cat.
She asked for a word, and I, brave little 5 year old said "Syzygy!" She
smiled a controlled smile, and said, Ah, we don't know yet about a thing
called VOWELS. My dear, certainly you can think of another word." Nope,
it's in there. S-y-z-y-g-y, Sister, I promise!" It was, of course, and at
the early age of five I was branded a smart mouth.

So use the word carefully.
Thanks.

Subject: Ambigram?

Can you please tell me what an ambigram is? It's this weeks' AWAD theme, and
I can't find a definition anywhere.

   It appears you joined in the middle of the week. Please see the posting
   for Oct 9, 2000 in the archives http://wordsmith.org/awad/archives.html
   to learn more about ambigrams.                                    -Anu

Subject: Ambigrams

You need to find a book titled "Inversions" by Scott Kim published in
paperback about 1975.

Subject: five or seven days

Since the poll was so close isn't there a possibility of arranging for those
who want to get your great service seven days a week to do so? Or would it
require too much work? For instance, what about newspapers which use AWAD?
Alternatively, those who want 'a dumb' weekend can just ignore AWAD or delete
it. And, also, is the majority always right?!
Bring back AWAD seven days a week, please!
Thanks,
Jean Sutherland,
Namibia

   Since the announcement of the poll result, I've received a large
   number of messages expressing disappointment at the reduced frequency
   of AWAD mailings. I'm thinking about making AWADmail a regular weekend
   feature. Consider this a small recompense for the two missing words per
   week. And as always, please keep me posted on what you like or do not
   like about AWAD.                                                -Anu

Subject: Number 13

Could you please give me the word that means a fear of 13 (the number 13)?
Thank you.

   Your question is timely as we just witnessed a Friday the 13th last week.
   The word is triskaidekaphobia (from Greek, triskaideka thirteen + phobia
   fear). Unfortunately (fortunately?), this past week was the only Friday
   the 13th to occur this year so you will have to wait until next April for
   the next.

   Another venue for posting your (and answer other's) questions is AWADtalk,
   the bulletin board at http://wordsmith.org/board . The board is frequented
   by a great number of veteran linguaphiles and you can count on them to
   answer questions and engage in some interesting discussion.        -Anu

Subject: Dark Forces

Your latest email arrived with a warning that it contained a picture. This
is the second time that this has happened. The first time I opened the email
and surprise! No picture. I did not open the second submission for fear of
vile (or viral) contamination. Has some dark force been diddling with your
server? Inquiring minds need to know.

   I've received similar messages from other AOL subscribers. We never send
   any attachments with the messages. Also we use a Linux server not Windows.
   You can't get a virus from us. AOL is not exactly known for following
   standards--it appears they are parsing text messages as HTML and then
   issuing spurious warnings about pictures. We'd rather send you a thousand
   words.                                                              -Anu
