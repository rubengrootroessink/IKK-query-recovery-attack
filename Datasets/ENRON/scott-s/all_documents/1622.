Work is of two kinds: first, altering the position of matter at or near the
earth's surface relative to other matter; second, telling other people to do
so. The first is unpleasant and ill-paid; the second is pleasant and highly
paid. -Bertrand Russell, philosopher, mathematician, and author (1872-1970)
