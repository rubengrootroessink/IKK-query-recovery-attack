FYI. In general everything went ok today Nov 10.

Susan Scott had some problems with some of the excel spreadsheets she's been 
running on her machine. The issue here is that the CopyFromRecordset method 
of a range object is failing. The simple
fix is to use a user defined function named rsOutput instead of the method. 
She also mentioned that a process that outputs a text file to the E: drive 
seems to be failing on her machine but is working fine on Dutch Quigley's 
machine. She'll provide more detail to support on Monday.

Cheers.
