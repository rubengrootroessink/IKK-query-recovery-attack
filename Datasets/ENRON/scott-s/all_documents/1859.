this is funny


HAVING A BAD DAY? 

For all of you who occasionally have a really bad day  when you just need to 
take it out on  someone!!!? Don't take that bad day out on someone you know,  
take it out on someone you DON'T know!!! 

Now get this.? I was sitting at my desk, when I  remembered a phone call I 
had 
to make. I  found the number and dialed it. 

A man answered nicely saying, "Hello?" 

I politely said, "This is Patrick Hannifin, could I  please speak to Robin 
Carter?" 

Suddenly the phone was slammed down on me!? I  couldn't believe that anyone 
could be that  rude. 

I tracked down Robin's correct number and called  her.? I had transposed the 
last two  digits incorrectly. 

After I hung up with Robin, I spotted the wrong  number still lying there on 
my  desk. 

I decided to call it again.  

When the same person once more answered, I  yelled? "You're a jackass!" and 
hung  up. 

Next to his phone number I wrote the word?  "jackass," and put it in my desk 
drawer. 

Every couple of weeks, when I was paying bills, or  had a really bad day, I'd 
call him  up. 

He'd answer, and I'd yell, "You're a jackass!". It  would always cheer me up. 

Later in the year the phone company introduced caller  ID.? This was a real 
disappointment for  me, I would have to stop calling the jackass.  

Then one day I had an idea.? I dialed his  number, then heard his 
voice,"Hello." 

I made up a name.? "Hi, this is Mike Smith with  the sales office of the 
telephone company and  I'm just calling to see if you're familiar with our 
caller ID program?" 

He went, "No!" and slammed the phone down.? I  quickly called him back and 
said, "That's  because you're a jackass!" 

[Keep reading, it gets better.] 

An old lady at the mall really took her time pulling  out of the parking 
place. I didn't think she  was ever going to leave. 

Finally, she got the car in reverse and she began to  move ... very slowly 
backing out of the  slot. 

I backed up a little more to give her plenty of room  to pull out. 

Great, I thought, she's finally leaving. 

All of a sudden this black Camaro comes flying up the  parking aisle in the 
wrong direction and  pulls into her space. 

I started honking my horn and yelling, "You can't  just do that, Buddy. I was 
here  first!" 

The guy climbed out of his Camaro completely ignoring  me.? He walked toward 
the mall as if he didn't even hear me.  

I thought to myself, this guy's a jackass, there sure  a lot of jackasses in 
this world. 

Then I noticed he had a "For Sale" sign in the back  window of his car. 

I wrote down the number. Then I hunted for another  place to park. 

A couple of days later, I'm at home sitting at my  desk.? I had just gotten 
off the phone  after calling my jackass friend and yelling, "You're a 
jackass!"? (It's  
really easy to call him now since I have his number  on speed dial.) 

I noticed the phone number of the guy with the black  Camaro lying on my desk 
and thought I'd  better call this guy, too. 

After a couple rings someone answered the phone and  said, "Hello."? I said, 
"Is this the man  with the black Camaro for sale?" 

"Yes, it is." 

"Can you tell me where I can see it?" 

"Yes, I live at 1802 West 34th street.? It's a  yellow house and the car's 
parked right out  front." 

I said, "What's your name?"  

"My name is Don Hansen."  

"When's a good time to catch you, Don?" 

"I'm home in the evenings."  

"Listen Don, can I tell you something?" 

"Yes." 

"Don, you're a jackass!"? And I slammed the  phone down. 

After I hung up I added Don Hansen's number to my  speed dialer. 

For a while things, seemed to be going better for  me. 

Now when I had a problem I had two jackasses to  call. 

Then, after several months of calling the jackasses  and hanging up on them, 
it just wasn't as  enjoyable as it used to be. 

I gave the problem some serious thought and came up  with a solution: 

First, I had my phone dial Jackass #1. 

A man answered nicely saying,"Hello." 

I yelled "You're a jackass!", but I didn't hang  up. 

The jackass said, "Are you still there?" 

I said, "Yeah." 

He said, "Stop calling me."  

I said, "No." 

He said, "What's your name, Pal?" 

I said, "Don Hansen."  

He said "Where do you live?"  

"1802 West 34th Street.? It's a yellow house and  my black Camaro's parked 
out 
front." 

"I'm coming over right now, Don.? You'd better  start saying your prayers." 

"Yeah, like I'm really scared, Jackass!" and I hung  up. 

Then I called Jackass #2.? He answered,  "Hello." 

I said, "Hello, Jackass!"  

He said, "If I ever find out who you  are..." 

"You'll what?" 

"I'll kick your butt."  

"Well, here's your chance.? I'm coming over  right now, Jackass!" 

And I hung up. 

Then I picked up the phone and called the  police. 

I told them I was at 1802 West 34th Street and that I  was going to kill my 
gay lover as soon as he  got home. 

Another quick call to Channel 13 about the gang war  going on down W. 34th 
Street. 

After that I climbed into my car and headed over to  34th Street to watch the 
whole  thing. 

Glorious!? Watching two Jackasses kicking the  crap out of each other in 
front 
of 6 squad  cars, a police helicopter, and channel 13 news cameras!!! 

It was one of the greatest experiences of my  life! 

Names changed to protect the guilty. 


O.K. Now stop laughing and crying, people are going to think you are a nut; 
especially the people on the other side of your wall.
