Subject: RE: Gas Industry Settlement


Another substantive change to consider is the allocation of firm capacity at
Wheeler Ridge between the north and south points.  Currently the settlement
has 520 for WH-N and 120 for WH-S for a total of 680.  PG&E has proposed a
"let the market decide" approach on the primary/secondary split by setting
each receipt point at its physical capacity (WH-N @ 520 and WH-S @ 500 with
the combination not greater than 680).  This approach provides more
flexibility to the shipper to move between the two points and maintain the
quality of the firm service.  I do not see any cost to SoCal or any other
party to the settlement by making this change.  I know Rich Hall has
discussed this with several of you already.  Attached is a document he sent
me outlining proposal.  Calpine supports this change but realizes that all
parties need to agree.

Thanks

Craig
