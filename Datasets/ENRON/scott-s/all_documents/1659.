You forget that I have a sister-in-law with many single women friends beyond 
the age of 30 who actually have attempted to change their dating luck with 
this book.  I think the very fact they read/apply this book is a great 
indication of why they are still unattached.  Everybody knows the fastest way 
to a man's heart is through espn and college football the prerequisite being 
of course the lady has the Southern charm/accent, blonde hair and preferably 
blue eyes (but hazel will do in a pinch assuming everything else is there).  
See, men are not that selective or demanding.
