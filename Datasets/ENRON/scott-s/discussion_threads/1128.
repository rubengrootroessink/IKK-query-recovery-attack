Satyagraha (suh-TYAH-gruh-uh, sut-YAH-gru-ha) noun

   The policy of passive resistance inaugurated by Mohandas Gandhi in 1919
   as a method of gaining political and social reforms.

[Sanskrit satyagrahah : satyam, truth (from sat-, sant-, existing, true) +
agrahah, determination, insistence : a-, to + grahah, act of seizing, from
grhnati, he seizes.]

   Events were so shaping themselves in Johannesburg as to make this
   self-purification on my part a preliminary as it were to Satyagraha."
   M.K. Gandhi, The Story of My Experiments With Truth, 1927.

This week's theme: words from Gandhi's autobiography.

.............................................................................
Patience serves as a protection against wrongs as clothes do against cold.
For if you put on more clothes as the cold increases, it will have no power
to hurt you. So in like manner you must grow in patience when you meet with
great wrongs, and they will then be powerless to vex your mind. -Leonardo da
Vinci, painter, engineer, musician, and scientist (1452-1519)
