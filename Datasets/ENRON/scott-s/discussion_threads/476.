GROSS! I never thought of velveeta as a dessert type ingredient! Although, I
DO have a 2 lb. brick at home so I have enough for BOTH recipes! Nasty!

Okay, it is a slow day at the office.  Here are recipes I found on the
Internet.
May be time to throw a White Trash party.

DOT'S CREAMY FUDGE

1 lb. margarine
1 lb. Velveeta cheese
1 Tbsp vanilla
4 lb. powdered sugar
1 cup Hershey's cocoa
1 cup nuts, chopped

Melt margarine, Velveeta cheese and vanilla in double boiler. Remove from
heat. Add powdered sugar, cocoa and nuts.  Mix together well. This sets up
fast. Press in buttered casserole dish. Makes about 5 pounds good fudge.

VELVEETA CHEESE FUDGE

1 lb. butter or margarine
1 lb. Velveeta cheese
1 cup cocoa
1 Tbsp vanilla
4 lb. powdered sugar
1 1/2 to 2 cup. nuts

Slowly melt butter and Velveeta. Can be done in microwave. Add cocoa and
vanilla. Mix well. Add powdered sugar and nuts. Mix well. This will be
very stiff. The last pound of powdered sugar may need to be added and
mixed by hand. Pour into buttered cookie sheet or 2 (9 x 13-inch) cake
pans. This makes about 6 pounds of very creamy and delicious fudge.
Stores well.

Mmm! Th' house did smell a bit oniony and I actually DID wonder even though
I had used small on-yons if I had used too many! I actually had cooked WAY
too much chicken .  They were pretty huge chicken breasts, so maybe I will
mix some of that stuff up for us from the leftover ingredients! I totally
overbought on Velveeta - minor grocery store freak-out I guess - so we can
make lots o' trashy Velveeta foods! I was in bed by 11:30 so it wasn't so
bad.
