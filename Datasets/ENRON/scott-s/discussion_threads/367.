Per Bob,

GPG legal is supposed to be able to send a note to the Helpdesk and the 
Helpdesk will take the steps to figure out which LANs the employee is on and 
to make all contacts to have the employee removed from the LAN, from GPG 
applications and HotTap and to contact corporate to have the employee's email 
profile changed.  

If this is not correct, please let me know the procedure that you would like 
GPG legal to take to ensure that a GPG/ETS/Citrus/OTS  employee is removed 
from our systems when they transfer.

Celestine, you asked who are the current marketing affiliates that cannot 
have access to GPG systems.  ENA and EES are marketing affiliates.  However, 
we do not ask the Helpdesk to figure out who can or who cannot have access or 
to sort out which employee transfers necessitate marketing affiliate 
measures.   GPG legal would like to be able to go through the same checklist 
for all employees leaving GPG to transfer to another Enron company or 
entering GPG from another Enron company.

Subject: Notice of Employee Transfer


Eric Thode, currently of GPG communications, has accepted a position in ENA 
Media Relations effective February 10, 2000.  To ensure that GPG continues to 
be in compliance with the marketing affiliate rules, Eric's access to any 
GPG-related LANs or applications should be removed at the close of business 
on February 9.  In addition, Eric's email profile should be changed and any 
GPG mass distribution  lists should be changed.  Eric is currently a user on 
the OTS LAN.

Please send a reply email to me after these changes have been completed, 
verfiying and indicating the date that employee was:
removed from the LAN.
EBB password was changed/canceled (if applicable).
removed from GPG-related applications.
email post office box was transfered.
