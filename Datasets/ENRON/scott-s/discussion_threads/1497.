>  Just a few tips for Christmas eating.
>
>
>         We all know that the true meaning of Christmas is not crass
>     Commercialism  -- but few realize how important food is. So here are
> some tips
> On Holiday eating:
>
>         1.) About those carrot sticks:  Avoid them. Anyone who puts
>  carrots on  a  holiday buffet table knows nothing of the Christmas
> spirit. In
> fact, if  you  see carrots, leave immediately. Go next door where they are
> serving rum balls.
>
>         2.) Drink as much eggnog as you can ...and quickly (I
> recommend A&E, the king of eggnog). Like fine scotch, it is rare. You
> can't find
> it any other  time of the year but now. So drink up. Who cares that it has
> 10,000 calories in every sip? It's not as if you're going to turn into an
>  eggnogaholic or something. It is a treat. Have one for me. It's later
> than you
> think.  It's Christmas.
>
>         3.) If something comes with gravy, use it. That's the whole
> point of gravy. Gravy does not stand alone, it is one of the basic food
>  groups.
>     Pour it on. Make a volcano out of your mashed potatoes. Fill it
> With  gravy. Eat the volcano. Repeat!
>
>         4.) Speaking of mashed potatoes, always ask if they're made
> with skim milk or whole milk. I won't even mention the dreaded
> instant ones.  If it is not whole milk, pass. Why bother? It's like buying
> sports
> car with  an  automatic transmission.
>
>         5.) Do not have a snack before going to a party in an effort to
> control your eating. The whole point of going to a Christmas party is to
> eat other people's food for free. Lots of it. Hello? Remember college?
>
>         6.) Under no circumstance should you exercise between now and New
> Year's.  You can do that in January when you have nothing else to do.
>   This is the time for long naps, which you'll need after circling the
> buffet
> Table while carrying a 10-pound plate of food and that vat of eggnog.
>
>         7.) If you come across something really good at a buffet table,
>     like frosted Christmas cookies in the shape and size of Santa,
>  position yourself near them and don't budge. Have as many as you can
> before becoming  the   center of attention. They're like a beautiful pair
> of shoes. You
>  can't leave  them behind. You're not going to see them again.
>
>         8.) Same for pies: Apple, pumpkin, mincemeat ... have a
> slice of  each (you don't want to hurt the hostess' feelings). If you
> don't like mincemeat, have two apples and one pumpkin.  Always have three.
> When else do you get to have more than one dessert? Labor Day?
>
>         9.) Did someone mention fruitcake? Granted, it's loaded
> with the mandatory celebratory calories, but avoid it all costs. I mean,
> have some standards, mate.
>
>         10.) And one final tip: If you don't feel terrible when you
> leave the party or get up from the table, you haven't been paying
>  Attention.
>     Reread tips. Start over.
>
>     But hurry, Cookieless January is just around the corner.
