Work is the curse of the drinking classes. 

                        - Oscar Wilde 


When I read about the evils of drinking, I gave up reading. 

                        - Henny Youngman 


"Wit is educated insolence." 
     - Aristotle (284-322 B.C.) 
                                         

"I think - therefore I'm single." 

                        - Lizz Winstead


It is with true love as it is with ghosts;
everyone talks about it, but few have seen it.
-La Rochefoucauld

     awhile, you might miss it."
     -Ferris Beuller's Day Off


     Arnold:  "I've taught myself how to cook, sew, fix plumbing and even give
     myself a pat on the back when necessary. The only things I need from
     anyone is love and respect and anyone who can't give me that has no
     place in my life"
