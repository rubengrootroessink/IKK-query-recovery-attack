Ten Cents A Dance

Ten cents a dance, that's what they pay me
How those FERC filings, they weigh me down
Ten cents a dance, staffers and rough guys
Tough guys who tear my gown

Seven to midnight, me and Cap'n Morgan
Loudly the Mary Kay blows
Faxes and EMails are consortin'
Glen Hass, get off my toes!

Sometimes I think I've found my hero
But it's a queer romance
All that you need is a ticket
Come on, Steve-y boy, ten cents a dance!
