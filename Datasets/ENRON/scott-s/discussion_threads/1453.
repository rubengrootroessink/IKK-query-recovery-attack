Dr. Strangelove (DOK-tuhr STRAYNJ-luv) noun

   A person, especially a military or government official, who advocates
   initiating nuclear warfare. Also called Strangelove.

[After a character in a movie of the same name (1963) by U.S. director
Stanley Kubrick.]

   "The US tests are part of a 13-year, $60 billion `stockpile stewardship'
   program which will enable our Dr. Strangeloves to design new nuclear bombs
   in computer-simulated virtual reality."
   Stanley K. Sheinbaum & Alice Slater, It is time to abolish nuclear arms,
   New Perspectives Quarterly, Summer 1999.

This week's theme: fictional characters who live on in the dictionary.
