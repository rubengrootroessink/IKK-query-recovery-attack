Hi Susan,
craig stopped by the Mountain Travel+Sobek website
and created a Postcard just for you!
To pick up your card, simply point your browser
at the page listed below:

http://mtsobek2.ddmweb.com/cgi-bin/runCardS.py?form=retrieveForm&card=1226&pas
swd=20001002142035

Cut and paste the URL into your browser to
ensure accuracy if you don't see a hyperlink.
(AOL users can enter the URL as a keyword)

The card will remain on the server for about two weeks,
so please pick it up as soon as you can.
