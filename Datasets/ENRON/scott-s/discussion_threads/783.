The sign up list to identify which covered dish, hours d' oeuvres or desserts 
your 
going to bringing on Monday are posted, on the wall, in front of the fax 
center.  So
far only a few people have signed up.  Your participation is very important 
so, 
please stop by the fax center and sign up.

If you plan on participating in the White Elephant Exchange I have also added 
a list 
at the fax center for you to sign up.  
 
Julie, Candace and Audrey, could you please forward this on 
to your groups within the 41st floor.

Subject: White Elephant Christmas Luncheon


OK Gang, we will be having the 2nd Annual White Elephant Christmas Luncheon 
again this year, on Monday December 18th  at 11:30.  To be included in this 
exciting game of chance, you are required to bring a covered dish and a 
wrapped gift of $10.00 or less.  These gifts can be gifts of use, or gag 
gift.  The same rules will apply this year as last, and that is, you can only 
trade your gift twice and your out of the game.  

Julia is kind enough to provide the honey glazed ham, plates, dinner ware and 
ice tea, which we will have in EB4102. Please bring a covered dish, hours d' 
oeuvres or a dessert (keep in mind, we could have a lot of people attend).  
She is also extending her invitation to the other departments on this floor, 
in hopes they would like to participate.

Julie, Candace and Audrey, could you please forward this on to your groups 
within the 41st floor.

See ya there!!!!!!!!
Ricki
