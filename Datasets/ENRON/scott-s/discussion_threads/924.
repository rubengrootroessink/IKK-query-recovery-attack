susie-  ashley wanted me to give you her email address; as you can see below
it is ashley.marynick@chase.com
i thought that you would enjoy reading her email!!
anyway, i had a ball getting to see you on sunday.  your stories were
excellent and i will look forward to hearing updates.  sounds like you
couldn't have picked a better guy to go out on a few dates with!! (see how
good i am about not making things too big of a deal :))
i also wanted to tell you that my parents said that your parents sent them
such a sweet note after the wedding.  i think my parents favorite thing
about the whole weekend was getting to talk to everyone on sunday--they love
you guys so much!!

have a great week and feel free to email me (and my many names to let me
know how noble things have been)
later tater
jessica

yea!  i tried the whole baker and botts address and nothing would go through
and
then i sent you a message on the aol account.  anyway, things are good.....a
little rain, but good.

before i get started though, tell clay congrats on the flat screen!  nice
work
babe!

ok.  i am fine.  it has been crap weather since i have arrive, but i am just
pretending that it is november in dallas!  we will have to see what month i
have
to fake in january....could be a bit tricky.  the office is really good.  i
think that we are going to do loads of cool stuff and there are lots of
young
people so it is a nice change.  it is so different from the other situation.
here there are lots of lowly staff and a few big shots whereas it was the
opposite in dallas.  this means that i come in a lot later and stay later,
however, their staying late includes dinner, time for a workout, and a taxi
home
so that is not too bad.  yesterday there was a corporate run of all the
banks in
london.  they ran at battersea park and then each bank had a huge tent at
the
end and drinks and dinner.  it was a nice way to get to meet people.
anyway, i
am hoping for good work and fun people to see at the office, besides the
smoking
factor (everyone) i think there might be a possibility.

lee.....he is good.  i think he is just about to keel over of exhaustion,
but
besides that i think he will be more relieved than me when i get things
sorted.
it is so funny because now we are going to be in a situation where we are in
the
same city but only get to see each other occasionally (two or three times a
week).....i mean, he still goes to work at 7 and i go at 9 and he gets out
at 6
and me at 10.......so, it is going to be a bit of an adjustment.  we had
gotten
used to the seeing each other once a month and having it be really intense
and
it is not going to be like that....mainly because we will be tired/busy/etc.
having said all of this, it is really fun to be on his same major schedule
and
to be able to see him when i do.  tonight i am going to get ot see him so i
am
really excited and then this weekend i think we are going to go to his house
because i still do not have a mattress and the hotel is kicking me out.
last
weekend i just about killed him by trips to get a vaccuum and hot pot and
stereo, etc.....at one point i was seriously contemplating cutlery!  a bit
insane i admit.

as for the airline......ba or aa go direct.  i just got a ticket for friday
dec
22 and returning thursday dec 28....so, any time aside from that.  i am
flying
aa.  if you all want to try and get on the 28th 5:30pm flight that might be
fun.
i can't remember what i priced but you all can decide.

i am going to continue my monologue......so bear with me.....i finally got
the
keys to my flat after many trials, but bate let me tell you....it is
awesome!
lee and i discovered a secret fire escape which leads to the roof......you
can
see the london eye (farris wheel for the millinium year and nelsons statue
which
is in trafalgar's square).  it is a really neat view.  and the windows in
the
place are just as wonderful as i remember......my room is a bit smaller, but
i
just hope that the furniture that i am bringing fits!

ok.  i am off for now.  send my love to clay/.....and then in houston to
everyone there.
