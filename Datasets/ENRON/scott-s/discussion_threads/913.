Hey,

Well, I figured you could use a joke after dealing with your trader (read 
below).  Hopefully, his positions are doing better today than yesterday so 
your life is a tad more pleasant.  The movie is playing a regular intervals 
(7:30, 8 & 9) so that should give us some flexibility in getting some food 
and then seeing the movie.  I'll talk to you later about the details.

Ted

By the way, when you have some free time check-out (this goes with the whole 
boots, blue jeans, white T-shirts theme).  You have to love free time in 
Enron Net Works.
