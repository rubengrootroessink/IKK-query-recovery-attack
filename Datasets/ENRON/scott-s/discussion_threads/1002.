fata morgana (fata mor-GAH-nuh) noun

   An optical phenomenon that creates the illusion of water, often with
   inverted reflections of distant objects, and results from distortion of
   light by alternate layers of hot and cool air. Also called mirage.

[Italian, mirage, Morgan le Fay (from the belief that the mirage was caused
by her witchcraft) : fata, fairy (from Vulgar Latin fata, goddess of fate)
+ Morgana, Morgan, probably from Old Irish Morrigain.]

   "It is too early in Go-Go to have predictable, controllable results, and
   a bonus based exclusively on a formula of controllable and achievable
   results is a fata morgana."
   Ichak Adizes, Surviving the Go-Go Years, The Pursuit of Prime, Jan 1996.
