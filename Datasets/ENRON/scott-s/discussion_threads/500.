Susan,

I don't know if my dad told you, but I am at Tulane law school and enjoying
it very much.  The work is challeging, but I am really happy with the my
choice of paths.  The campus is beautiful, the people are normal, the town is
amazing (a bit distracting at times), and my professors and the law school in
general are fantastic.

I am writing you to ask for your advice.  They are beginning to apply the job
search pressure to us (it is already the 8th week) and I am trying to figure
out my best course of action.  I have heard that most of the big firms in
Houston aren't even looking for students after only their 1st year-- that
they prefer to interview after the 2nd year for summer clerk positions and
then associate jobs. Do you know of any smaller firms or specific attorneys
that I might be able to pursue with a letter and resume?

What did you do after your first year?  Did you stay in Texas?  I do know
that I want to practice in Houston, so I think that working there during
this, my first summer, would be a smart idea.  It will at least give me more
time to make contacts/ meet people.

What do you think?  Any thoughts/advice you have would be greatly appreciated.


Thank you,
Katy
