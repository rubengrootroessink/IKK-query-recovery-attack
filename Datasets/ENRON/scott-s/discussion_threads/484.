Well, the last thing I need right now is anything involving strings, so in 
that
respect, maybe we should just all meet up for a happy hour and not call it
ANYTHING, like a date, or set-up, or whatever!  I'd like to meet this guy,
though, since you do know him.  Like you said, I'm NOT going to meet anyone 
in a
bar.  John doesn't have any kids, or x--wives does he?

I was kinda interested in the manager of Sambuca, Charles (Chuck) Dearborn, 
and
he seemed kinda interested in me, BUT then I found out he has an x-wife and 2
kids in another state.  NO THANKS!  Where is the line for baggage-free 
men???  I
know we all have it, but just for once, I'd like to meet a man who can DEAL 
WITH
HIS OWN...MATURELY!

You're right, though, I need to try to date a guy with a "normal" job.  I 
don't
know what's wrong today, but I miss Craig so much right now.

Later,
Ro

John is tall, dark & handsome (and as I told you yesterday, very fit).  He
looks very Italian.  I've known him most of the time I've been at Enron;
first met him when he was dating (i.e., going out on just a few dates with)
my friend Staci.  He is very fun and very sweet but just a tad bit flighty;
still think he has some growing up to do.  That's why I warned Dianna that
he would probably just be someone to go out on a few dates with, for fun.
I really don't think he's ready to settle down at all.  On the other hand,
he's fun to be with, and has a way of making you feel that you're the only
woman in the room.  That kind of attention (the lighthearted,
no-strings-attached kind) might be just what you need right now.  The
problem with Dianna was that she instantly fell in love with him, and of
course was very frustrated when he did not call every day or want to hang
out all the time.  She finally started acting a little cold towards him.
His take on the situation:  she expects too much!
The only difficulty might be that John could be leery of dating my friends
by now!  But I can test the waters and let you know...

You're like me - my back has been bothering me, too lately, especially
after a
match and all that serving - I just have no desire right now to play that
tournament.  The cold doesn't help the stiffness, either.  I'm already
playing
HTA league, and I'm just still not interested in hanging out at the Met
much.  I
don't think I'm going to play Kingwood, either.  I'll make a decision by
tomorrow - I just really want to get out of town.

I want you to tell me more about this friend of yours.  What happened with
Diana?  What does he look like?  What does he do?  How long have you known
him -
TELL ME THE SCOOP!  After Craig, who is still the most gorgeous man I have
ever
been out with, it's just so difficult to see myself with anyone right now.
I
know I need to move on, and he'll come back when he's ready, IF I am
available.

Tell me - and if we do go out, we HAVE to double - I need to meet Craig
anyway......

Later,
Ro

I think I'm going to have to quit tennis.  My back hurts every time I play
a match.  It even hurts from yesterday's drill.  I think it is best if I
drop out of all the organized tennis I've signed up for this month.  Danny
is going to hate me.  Maybe he would let you sub in for me for the 4.5
singles tournament, since no one has played any matches yet (assuming you
want to play).  Ugh.  I really hate to not play tennis but I have to make
this back last for 35+ more years!  So it's just not worth it.

Good to see you looking so happy yesterday!  we need to find you a man in
Houston.  If/when you want me to set you up with my friend, let me know!

S.
