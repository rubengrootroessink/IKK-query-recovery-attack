If we relocate him to Pasadena, he will find his way back! I vote SPCA

I suggest putting the trap out with food as fast as humanly possible as this
cat has to go! A hungry cat is a motivated cat! If it does not work, we can
put food out sans trap and get his confidence,  then use the trap. I think
mouse will go for the canned food -the stinkier the better.

Assuming Mouse is caught - what then? SPCA and the likely result or do we
relocate him to, lets say, Pasadena?

I think if he develops a "taste" for something on our back porch it will
only make him hang around more...we should be as cruel as possible and just
stick something out there when we are ready to take him in...he seemed
pretty willing the last time (although he may be smarter now that he is
fatter and not seemingly as hungry)
Trapper Craig probably knows the best procedure though, so I will defer to
his suggestions...

SPCA has several "cat" (Mouse) traps available.
They're only open 'til 7 tonight and I have a DiverseWorks meeting at 6.
Not sure if I will make it over there today.  Could probably go at lunch
tomorrow.  Question:  when to set the trap?  Shall we at least appease him
with a little food on the back porch first, maybe something really stinky
and canned?  That will give him a chance to develop a taste for the salmon,
tuna, whatever we bait the trap with; plus it might get him to shut up.
Then we can set the trap when there is time to take him to the shelter.  I
figure it is probably best not to trap him during the wee hours; we have
probably not yet heard Mr. Mouse at his loudest.
Comments?  Any advice from Trapper Craig?
