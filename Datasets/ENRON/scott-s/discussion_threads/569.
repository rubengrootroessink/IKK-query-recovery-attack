Lorraine,
I am filling the position that Darin Aucoin vacated this week.  I will be
your contact for the Transwestern and El Paso Field Services interconnect
currently being negotiated.  Attached is a redline version of the
Operational Balance Agreement which has been reviewed by EPFS' legal
department.  There are a few questions I have that we need to discuss at
your earliest convenience.  You can reach me at 713-420-7338.

Thank you Lorraine and I look forward to working with you soon.
