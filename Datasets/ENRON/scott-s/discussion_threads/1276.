MR. MAXIMILER: Our newest column from OneTravel.com's own Frugalist, Bob=20
Jones, features up-to-the-minute tips and deals that maximize your air mile=
s=20
and save you travel cash.  Read on for this week's "Mr. Maximiler" tip!

The Turkey Trot is more than a dance.

This week, between now and Saturday, virtually all the airlines will notice=
=20
that their planes are going to be empty Thanksgiving Day. Even though the=
=20
week surrounding Thanksgiving Day is one of the busiest air travel periods =
in=20
North America, the planes on Turkey Day lack the appropriate stuffing of=20
passengers.

You can make this work to your advantage!  Let's say that you live in=20
Chicago. Wednesday evening, your wife says to you, "Honey, take the turkey=
=20
out of the freezer downstairs and bring it up so it will thaw."  Dutifully,=
=20
you reply, "Yes dear," and go back to the Bulls game.  Thursday morning whi=
le=20
you are finishing up your beauty rest, there is a shriek from the kitchen.=
=20
Running in, you see the remains of the bird on the floor and your Lab with =
a=20
big smile on his face. Yep, you brought the turkey upstairs but put it on t=
he=20
table, not the fridge, to thaw. It looks like it will be crow for dinner fo=
r=20
you and the pup.  What to do?

As empty-nesters, you are free to do whatever you want.  You call the few=
=20
places serving Thanksgiving dinner. You find little availability at this la=
te=20
date. The hotel has one table left at 9 p.m., but the bill will probably be=
=20
in the three-figure range. Wait, you remembered reading this column last we=
ek=20
and pick up the phone. Your daughter, who married that guy whose name you=
=20
can't remember, invited you to Indianapolis for Thanksgiving, her first on=
=20
her own.  "Hi, Honey, I want to surprise your mom.  Does that invitation fo=
r=20
dinner still stand?"

"Oh, Pops, you know it does, but hasn't it been snowing a little in town?"

"Yes, dear, but don't worry, we won't be driving. What time is dinner?"

"Three o'clock, Dad, just before the game. You and Fred can watch it. Love=
=20
you, Dad, see you soon."

Back on the phone you find a fare of $120 roundtrip per person. (That is th=
e=20
current low price but I expect to drop even more over the next few days.) S=
o=20
you book your flights, tell your wife to get dressed for dinner and head fo=
r=20
the airport. You arrive in Indianapolis, spend a wonderful day with your=20
daughter and Fred (whom you realize knows absolutely nothing about football=
)=20
and catch your flight home at 7 p.m.  In bed by 9 p.m., your wife rolls ove=
r=20
and says, "Thanks for a wonderful day!"

Over the next few days, you will see some exceptional deals for travel on=
=20
Thanksgiving Day.  Watch for them, just in case!

Happy Contrails,
Bob "Mr. Maximiler" Jones
