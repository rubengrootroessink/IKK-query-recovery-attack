HI Susan!!

I'm so glad to hear from you!  I know how crazy life  is, so don't
worry....that's the great thing about good friends- you can always pick up
where you left off!  I know it's tough to email a ton, too, so we'll just
write each other short notes whenever we can....

Can you fly using your dad's passes? I'll keep my eyes open for great
rates, too, because I would love for you to come visit- San Diego is of
course perfect during the summer!  Here are some weekends that are good for
me- just so we can get the dialogue started about you coming to visit....I
think the only way we can catch up on several years of news and gossip is
for you to come out and visit!!
July 28-30th
August 18-20th
August 25-27th
September 1-4th (Labor Day Weekend)

Brendan is moving into a new place right on the beach, and I live about a
mile from the beach, so we will have a great time lounging around and
shopping whenever you can come visit.  Let me know what you think- I'll
talk to you soon!

Julie
