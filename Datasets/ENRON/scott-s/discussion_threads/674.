Hi, Sooz!  How are you feeling?  Is the tree still in one piece?

Went to the doc this a.m. and he says my lungs sound clear.  I'm to continue
using an expectorant for 10 more days and get an x-ray Wed.  He's ok'd my
trip to Calif, but no skiing.  We had already decided that.  Probably keep
our reservation at River Ranch and least for a couple of nights though.  So,
if all continues to go well, I'll leave on the 8th.

I don't know for sure if Mother has a whirlpool but there's something in the
back of my mind that thinks she does.  I haven't been thinking much about her
except I know she wants some tights--queensize.  Have been concentrating on
you and K, J, & G. and am doing pretty well.  I figure if I get everything
bought for all of you, then when I come back, I'll have plenty of time to
worry about her.

love, mum
