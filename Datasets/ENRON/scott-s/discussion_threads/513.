We'll be playing at the Houston City Club Tuesday Oct 24th.  

Directions:
From 59 S, exit Weslayen, turn right on Richmond, right on Timmons, and left 
on City Club Dr.  You should see a sign for visitor parking, take a ticket 
and they will validate $2.00 of it.  There's no events so we should be able 
to find a space.

Line 2 - Randy/Janice
Line 3 - Christy/Debbie
Line 4 - Susan/ ?   -  May have to default this line, I'll keep you posted.
