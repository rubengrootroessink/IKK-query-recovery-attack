Ms. Holland,

I am a first year law student at Tulane, and currently seeking a summer
associate position with a well-regarded Houston law firm.

I have attached my resume and would very much like to meet with you while I
am home in Houston during winter break in order to discuss a possible
clerkship with your firm.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you.


Warmest regards,
Katy Gottsponer
