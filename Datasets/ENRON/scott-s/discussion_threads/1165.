I have put together a file to check the official flag of the books. This is 
in response to the email below from Gossett, please read.
I am asking that this file be run, printed out and left on my desk every 
night for each person that officializes books.


The files are located in the Financial Books (The Family) folder.

Kori ---- Please see me to set up you file

Thanks 
Dutch

We have been tracking books that are not officialized on a daily basis.  This 
list goes to Sally Beck and is reviewed at the end of each week by Rick Buy.  
Rick has been vocal about taking corrective action if people forget to 
officialize.   It is imperative that we take extra care to ensure that all 
books are marked official each night before going home.  A control process 
should be implemented immediately to absolutely avoid being on the list.  

Please contact me if you have any questions (x-35242).

Thanks,
Mike
