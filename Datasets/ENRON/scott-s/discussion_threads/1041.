Zeno's paradox (ZEE-no PAR-uh-doks) noun

   Any of various versions of a paradox regarding the relation of the
   discrete to the continuous and requiring the concept of limit for its
   satisfactory explanation.

[After Zeno of Elea, circa 490-430 B.C.]

   "Oh, if you're looking
   for a timetable, it's there, in that train, that's now
   two feet away, now one, but will never obstruct
   or demolish us. Thank heaven for Zeno's paradox!"
   John Ashbery, Love in boots, The American Poetry Review, Jan 2, 1995.

This week's theme: syndromes, paradoxes, laws, and principles.

Wit makes its own welcome, and levels all distinctions. No dignity, no
learning, no force of character, can make any stand against good wit. -Ralph
