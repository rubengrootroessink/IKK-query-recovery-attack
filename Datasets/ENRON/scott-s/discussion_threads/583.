Please help... I'm getting really tired of looking at this.  When you read 
it, bear in mind that we're hoping to get Caithness "off the dime" in terms 
of moving forward, while helping them out with their modeling efforts by 
giving them a "starting number" for purposes of the lateral transportation 
cost.  Thanks!!!!
