We had to change the name of the Brook LLC to Brook I LLC (that's a Roman 
numeral I) since the "Brook LLC" name turned out to be unavailable in 
Delaware.  Please pass the word to other interested parties.  Thanks,  Deb

Deb - to confirm my voice mail message, the name Brook LLC is not available 
in DE.  Brook, Inc. was formed in DE in 1986.  CT advised Teresa that it was 
available, but it appears they were mistaken. 

Since this will change the partnership interest of the two LPs, I'm at a 
stand still until I hear from you.

Thanks.
