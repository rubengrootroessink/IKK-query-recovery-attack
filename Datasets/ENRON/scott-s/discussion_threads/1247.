Agustin,

I am trying to confirm the counterparty on one of your deals so that it can 
be properly assigned in TAGG.  The ticket for the deal in question reads 
Barcel Mexico.  However, I spoke recently with Beatrice Reyna who informed me 
that you believed the counterparty to be one of the Bimbo companies.  If you 
wouldn't mind looking into this and getting back to me with the correct 
counterparty name it would be much appreciated.

Thanks,
Susan
