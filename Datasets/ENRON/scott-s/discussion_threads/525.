Bug had a busy Halloween at school- Big kids dressed up trick or treated at
all the classrooms and bug was the only baby still awake during this time so
they put her in a high chair to watch all of the action.  She fell asleep on
the short ride home which she never does. We bought her an outifit to wear
at Old Navy that's not really a "costume". It is an orange one piece thing
with these cute smiling spiders on it that says "silly spiders". It was a
little boyish, but the pumpkin motif suit was on white t-shirt material and
I knew it would be totally stained by the end of the day.  The orange hid
those pesky carrots and peaches! We took pictures of her holding on to the
gourd jack-o-lantern yesterday morning.  I think she enjoyed watching the
kids come to our door for candy, but she really didn't like the doorbell
much at all. The "Hamlets" slummed it and left their million dollar house
area of Alamo Heights to come trick or treat on the old street.  They
brought new baby whose name sounds like Frayton - not sure how to spell -
but it was fun to see them again. Well, we will hook up another weekend but
in the meantime I will send portraits and hopefully some other pics your
way.

Hi!  Sorry to hear about the stomach virus and I hope you are feeling much
better.
Just back from Cali.  It was a fun trip!
I'm in need of a Bug fix, especially after comparing niece/nephew notes
with (and bragging a lot to) Sue, Edd and Craig over the weekend.
Unfortunately, I have to stay in Houston this weekend for a wedding.  Was
contemplating visiting the weekend of Nov. 11 but you know that's totally
D.E.'s call.
If you mail photos, I'd suggest sending to me at my office, c/o Enron
Transportation Services, 1400 Smith St., Room 4788 (very important),
Houston 77002.  That way they will not get mangled or wet.
Did you dress the little one up for Halloween?
Have a good day!

OK! Since our last attempt to go to Austin was foiled by a bout of stomach
virus, we will go THIS weekend for much needed wig control! Might you be
available for a visit ? Just thought I'd clue you in since you haven't seen
bug for a while! I picked up her portraits today at lunch and they look
good! If we meet in Austin this weekend I will hand deliver, otherwise I'll
mail or FedEx.  What address would you prefer, home or office? Let me know!
