bovarism (BO-vuh-riz-em) noun

   An exaggerated, especially glamorized, estimate of oneself; conceit.

[From French bovaryisme, after Emma Bovary, a character in Flaubert's
novel Madame Bovary.]

   "The public property is not so much her as Bovarism. She is part of the
   collective unconscious. She is, and can be, everyone."
   Alan Franks, France's best-kept secret, The Times of London,
   Aug 12, 1995.
