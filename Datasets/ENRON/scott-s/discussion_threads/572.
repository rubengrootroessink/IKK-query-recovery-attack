Hi, Sooz--Just returned from the most hedonistic of all events:  the Jr.
League Christmas boutique.  Everytime I go, I come home thinking we should
forget all family gift-giving and concentrate our efforts on Whoville!
Anyway, it's Marge's birthday and this is what she wanted to do, so we went
with all the hoards and dined on a cold pasta lunch and cold ice tea in the
tearoom for $10.  We were very disappointed when we saw people walking around
upstairs with cheese and chili smothered hotdogs!

Parking a mess--no lots at Palmer due to construction.  So, satellite parking
with shuttle buses.  Took an hour at 2 p.m. from waiting in line to arriving
at the car in Zilker, but the only civil way to handle it.

Your list is wonderful and I've already homed in on my first choices.  Thank
you very much--it will jumpstart my shopping.

More later.  love, mum
