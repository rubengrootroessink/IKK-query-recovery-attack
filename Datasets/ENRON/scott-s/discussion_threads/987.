ylem (I-lum) noun

   A form of matter hypothesized by proponents of the big bang theory
   to have existed before the formation of the chemical elements.

[Middle English, universal matter, from Old French ilem, from Medieval
Latin hylem, accusative of hyle, matter, from Greek hule.]

   "Alpher and Gamow focused on the point when the universe had cooled to a
   state consisting of radiation and matter, ylem, Greek for the primordial
   stuff of life."
   Joseph D'Agnese, The last Big Bang man left standing, Discover, Jul 1999.
