Here I thought that the only true way into your Texas gal heart was through a 
new pair of stranglers and spotted snake-skin boots. I guess I'll have to go 
to find another way - maybe through a Hawaiian Biker ensemble.

Ted, 

I tried to send this page a little while ago and I think it failed.  So, you 
may have to actually drop this address into the netscape location section to 
bring up the site.

Anyway, there seemed to be a pretty good selection on the web.  Still, I 
think the one on this page best captures the kind of image you're looking to 
project.

If you'd rather shop around try these (there are some outstanding designs)...

don any of the items contained within them I may be forced to sever all ties 
               and deny ever having known you.
