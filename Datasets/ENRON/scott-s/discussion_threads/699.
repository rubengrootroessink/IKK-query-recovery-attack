Ann, the address for our Corporate Data Reports is 
http://home.enron.com:84/secretariat/netview2.htm.  The login ID is 
"secretariat" and the password is "c0rpsec" ("0" is a zero).  If you can't 
get there by simply clicking on the address above or via your internet 
browser, contact your IT administrator.  My understanding is that your legal 
group already has access to this information.
