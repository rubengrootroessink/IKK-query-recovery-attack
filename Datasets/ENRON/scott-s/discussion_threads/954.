Hey,

My car actually works.  Can you believe it.  Now I can take you to movies and 
we can actually watch them but somehow I think watching a movie at home is 
just a tad more fun.

Evidently, in order for us to actually watch a movie we have to physically go 
to the theatre.  Somehow we keep missing that critical step in the home 
viewing experience...namely the viewing.
