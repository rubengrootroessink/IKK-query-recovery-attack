   1. The natural force of attraction exerted by a celestial body, such as
      Earth, upon objects at or near its surface, tending to draw them toward
      the center of the body. The natural force of attraction between any two
      massive bodies, which is directly proportional to the product of their
      masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between
      them. Gravitation.

   2. Grave consequence; seriousness or importance.

   3. Solemnity or dignity of manner.

[French gravite, heaviness, from Old French, from Latin gravitas, from

GRAVITY
If it weren't for gravity, we wouldn't know which way was was up. Without
gravity to pull things "down," there would be no such thing as up or down.
This is an excellent example of the yin/yang idea that nothing exists except
in relation to its opposite. The opposite of gravity is weightlessness. A fair
conclusion: Gravity is the soul of wt.
