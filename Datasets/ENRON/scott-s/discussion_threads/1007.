imbroglio (im-BROL-yoh) noun

   1. A difficult or intricate situation; an entanglement. A confused or
      complicated disagreement.

[Italian, from Old Italian, from imbrogliare, to tangle, confuse : in- +
brogliare, to mix, stir, probably from Old French brooiller, brouiller.]

   "Leasing would have helped Serbs and ethnic Albanians out of the Kosovo
   imbroglio. Both sides demanded exclusive control over the province, and
   Western negotiators could convince neither to back down."
   James Ron and Alexander Cooley, Suppose Israel Leased the Jordan Valley
   From the Palestinians, International Herald Tribune, Jul 8, 2000.

It is criminal to steal a purse, daring to steal a fortune, a mark of
greatness to steal a crown. The blame diminishes as the guilt increases.
