Griselda (gri-ZEL-duh) noun

   1. A woman of exemplary meekness and patience.

   2. A female given name: from a Germanic word meaning `gray battle.'

[Def. 1 after a character in a tale of the same name in Giovanni Boccaccio's
Decameron.]

   "Whereas Rosina in `Barber' is a spitfire, all flame and sass, Cenerentola
   is a more demanding and less appealing role. She must bide her time but
   persuade her audience and her Prince that she's more than a patient
   Griselda who deserves happiness and redemption.
   Willard Spiegelman, Opera: Cinderella is a ball, The Wall Street Journal,
   Nov 2, 1995.

This week's theme: fictional characters who live on in the dictionary.
