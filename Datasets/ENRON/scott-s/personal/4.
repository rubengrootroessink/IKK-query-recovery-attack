Robert just called and said he was bored.  Can I forward your e-mail to him 
for the obnoxious male perspective?
Pretty please?

If not, I would advise deciding what you want to do and dressing 
appropriately.  I know you don't want to hear this but unless you know he's 
going to show up in jeans (and he doesn't sound like the type), jeans are a 
no-no.  Haven't you read the Houston girl's corollary to the Rules:  No jeans 
during the first month unless you are attending (1) the Rodeo (in which case 
jeans should be pressed and pleated); (2) a honky tonk; (3) a Nascar event or 
(4) #s.

The not-so-great-and-even-less-powerful (in fact, i'm not sure why you bother 
to ask me for advice at all) Ann has spoken.

Go forth and date.  It'll be okay.

Rules Girl Hotline!
I suggested both the Dan Electro and the Going Out Downtown ideas to Craig,
and we got off on a tangent and never made a decision, except that he is
coming over at 7:30.  Now I'm faced with the dilemma of what to wear (only
a problem when I go out with Craig).

Should I:
a) call him at home later and ask him where we're going
b) wear something noncommittal that wouldn't be especially appropriate at
either venue
c) wear jeans and change into something nicer if we go downtown
d) wear a slipdress and change into jeans if we go to the Heights
hinterlands?

Pls. reply.
I hate dating.
