...that her husband can be so devious.

Here's hoping that you can join me in surprising Kim Watson for the 11th
anniversary of her 29th birthday.  Her birthday is actually on December
17th, but a key part of the deception is surprising her early.

We hope to see you on Friday, December 8, at The Spires, 2001 Holcombe
Blvd., Unit 2406 (77030).  If you need directions, you can call the front
desk at (713) 799-2501.  Desserts, wine, coffee and soft drinks will be
served.

The most current plan calls for folks to gather at our home between 7:30 and
8:00 p.m. on December 8.  Kim and I will be returning from our co-birthday
dinner (both of us are December kiddos), no earlier than 8:00 p.m. and will
proceed to unit 2406.  We'll come in and...(you know the rest...).

I need to have a rough head count of those who can make it, so please reply
to this e-mail by December 6 with your RSVP, or you can leave me a voice
mail at (281) 440-5300 x222.  Both are secure from Kim, so don't worry about
using either of these methods.  If you've already told me you can't make it,
you don't need to reply again.

Remember, no gifts, please.  Your presence will be gift enough.

Hope to see you on the 8th!

John Watson
