Well, since you asked (And I know you did not but I can not resist - I
laughing very hard right now) I think about you and how sweet you are. I try
not to fixate as I believe it is unhealthily both psychologically and
physically as I can easily run for an hour.

You mean that when you run and listen to music you can think too?
Obviously you are every bit as talented as you are handsome and charming.

Getting an e-mail from you definitely gives me a big smile on my face!

Lunch was wonderful - I did not want to go back to work. I would have loved
to spend the day with you.

Now regarding being your office boy, I did not say anything about group as
I
can not be distracted from your needs, I can't think of a better job unless
you owned an art gallery and I was the mover de arte'

You did not ask me what I thought of when I ran.
