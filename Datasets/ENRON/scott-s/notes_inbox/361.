masseuse! : )? i'll start brainstorming and planning....i'm sure we'll have 
fun whatever we do, though....anything in particular that comes to your 
mind?? or should i suggest as i did last time?? it might be nice beach

Okay, there's a flight out of Houston on the 15th that gets into SD at
10:45 pm and the return flight is on Sunday around 3:30.? If that works for
you I'm going to go ahead and book the ticket now.

I'm so glad to hear that you're move was such a rousing success.? As for
myself and all of the guy juggling, I'm trying to get that under control.
Truth be told, none of them are worth a dime.? I think it was more of an
ego thing on my part.? Anyway, I still can't see the point in wasting time
on guys I'm not interested in so (like I said) I've ceased the rampage.
I'm not taking any time off for Christmas so this trip would be a very
welcomed respite.

Let me know about the times.
