Hey!  How are all of you doing?  Everything's going well with us.  Farrell 
and I
went home for Thanksgiving.  It was our first time back home since the 
wedding.
It was kinda strange because since we live nearby each other, we had to decide
whos house we were going to stay at and when.  Oh the joys of being married 
and
having to split your time between the families!  It was good to see his mom
because we hadn't seen her since she started her chemo treatments.  She's 
doing
well - she's pretty much lost all of her hair, but she is now getting some of
her strength back.  She goes back to Houston next week for her fourth 
treatment
and they'll do a sonogram to see how the tumor is doing.  She will most likely
have a mastectomy in the next few months, and then we'll just go from there.
We also drove up to Austin last Thursday night for the game of Friday - GO
HORNS!!  What a fun game that was!  I had been debating on whether or not I 
was
going to go because I had surgery the Thursday before (tonsillectomy - YUK!!)
It was hard to not be able to scream after we scored touchdown after 
touchdown!!
I saw a lot of our pledge sisters at the game - Lindsay, Erica, Stacey, etc. I
was kinda out of it, though, because I was on a lot of pain medication, so 
they
probably thought I was nuts!
Anyway, I just wanted to make sure I have all of your correct addresses.  
Corey
and Susan, do y'all still live in the same places?  And Elizabeth, I think
you've moved, so can you just email me your address again?
Thanks!!  Y'all write back and let me know what's been going on with all of 
you!
Love,
Steph
