you still in Houston or where are you and what are you up to>
I have not heard from you in quite a while.

So what have you been up to and how is Enron treating you. when are you going 
to London.

All is well here...well work is very stressful, but it's cool and i do love 
my job despite all the bitching i do.
It's just a lot of strss.
I've made some big move and actually won a big project over a VP.
You will be seing me soon in Houston. (can't tell you more)

Anyway
Partying like crazy..that's all I do..girls..girls...and more girls...i can't 
even remember all their names OUPS>
Still in love with Shannon, and no she is still not in my life and yes she is 
still in Houston...I hope life helps a little on this one.
Partying..like 4-5 times a week..
But above all, working out like an animal. It's been really good and i'm 
starting to look like i did at Enron...a machine.
Running a lot and working out...

So what is up with you?

be in touch
