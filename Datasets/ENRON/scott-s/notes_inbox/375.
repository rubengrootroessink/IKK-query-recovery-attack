Sue,
How are you?  What's new in H-town?  Any new guys on the scene--doing
their 'courting'?  I will be coming back to Houston for 6 weeks in a week!
Actually kind of excited--mixed feelings though.  So, Nick has some big 
news that I think would only be right for you to hear from him.  An aside,
if you come to London, I know a fun Kiwi girl that wants to move closer to
work--just looking out for you Susan.  Made any progress on getting over
here?  

Hopre you are well.  I'll call you when I get into town.
--Darren
