 I was starting to wonder if you actually found someone more intereting and 
fun then me....NOT!

it's nice to know, and nice to hear that work is going well...and don't worry 
about treating the male gender like shit. I myself i'm going to through a 
total...freaking out stage....i've hocked up more then 18 times in the past 
month...different girls. (no sex)
Just keeping ,myself bsuy while my borken heart and soul is trying find 
its'ground since Shannon and I have stopped!
So i take it your busy...

I had another big week end myself
Restaurant opening "sushi Samba" free food, free drinks and hot girls. 
NICE....then on to a Model agency party. "Icon"..NICE...but a little weak on 
the patying side.
So on to Syrene...partied there until 6:30 am..NICE"

making out with girls.. (juliette, Jeanie, Linda, kristy and my favorite 
right now Niki!) DId I mention that Jeanie and Linda are sweedish, and 
lesbians!

A good nigh followed by a relaxing saturday. Brunch, shopping, work out, 
dinner with Alison and Jeanie at "Cantine" and on to a house party. great 
time there.
Lots of hot girls..and good music. good people...a good time...Yes there also 
I made out with girls. I've gotten quite good at it! hi hi...
gils of the night: Jeanie, Gretchen, Linda....
Then on to Syrene...but i did not like the crowd so i was back home early at 
3:30am...

Sunday was another relaxing day.
Shopping, and work out, then met up my friends for some partying at 
"Felix"...then dad invited me for dinner and back out at "Boom" for some 
brazilian live music and some hot girls...yes dancing and more dancing...and
