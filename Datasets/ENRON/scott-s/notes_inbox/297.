white elephant (hwyt EL-uh-fent) noun

   1. A possession unwanted by the owner but difficult to dispose of.

   2. A possession entailing great expense out of proportion to its
      usefulness or value to the owner.

   3. An abnormally whitish or pale elephant, usually found in Thailand;
      an albino elephant.

[From the perhaps apocryphal tale that the King of Siam would award a
disagreeable courtier a white elephant, the upkeep of which would ruin the
courtier.]

   "Now an orchestra opening a new hall has reason to pray, solemnly and at
   length, that it will not be saddled with a white elephant with mediocre
   acoustics."
   Allan Kozinn, A Venerable Concert Hall That's the Belle of the Ball,
   The New York Times, Sep 30, 2000.

This week's theme: animal words that are used figuratively.

It is unwise to be too sure of one's own wisdom. It is healthy to be
reminded that the strongest might weaken and the wisest might err.
-Mohandas K. Gandhi (1869-1948)
