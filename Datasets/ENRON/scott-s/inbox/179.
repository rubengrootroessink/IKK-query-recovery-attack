   "But both the book and the exhibit show clearly that along with these
   changes in diet, sport and exercise had an early start and a long run
   among the tangled tantivy of 19th-century cures, cons, leeches, preachers,
   drugs, zaps, baths, diets, teetotaling, indoor plumbing, ventilation, and
   `Spanish Nerve Grains' that stampeded Americans into our current obsession
   with fitness."
   Christina Robb, Exercists America's Longtime Pursuit of Fitness,
   The Boston Globe, Mar 13, 1988.
