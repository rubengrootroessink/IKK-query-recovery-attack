Hey Susan,

I don't know if you remember me or not, I went to UT and was a good
friend of Stephanie Spence.  I know I met you at one of her showers or
maybe as late has her wedding.  Anyway, several people have told me that
you work here so I thought that I would say hello.

How long have you worked here?  What do you do?  Do you like it?  I'm on
the 25th floor with Net Works.  I started in January and so far I like
it.  I'm still trying to get used to my job and Houston in general.

Well, I just wanted to let you know I'm here.  Talk to you later.

Amy
