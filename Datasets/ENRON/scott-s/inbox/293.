you beat me to the punch....but that's just because your up and at work
before god.  i know exactly what y0u mean, and is funny, b/c i think we kind
of all sense that kind of thing about each other.  i could tell you were
"off" last night, and felt bad the whole ride home worrying about it.  i
say, let it ride.  sometimes you have to force yourself to buck up (ie, KK)
and sometimes you have to wallow a bit.  the key is finding the healthy
middleground.  takes a while i'm sure, but practice makes perfect.  and it
IS friday.....maybe will pick you up later in dad's (oops!  i mean MY!)NEW
CAR...god knows what it'll be....but 25 yr old can't look an interest-free
gift horse in the mouth.  plus- i would kiss the ground he walked on if it
meant i didn't have to deal w/ car salesmen.  ok- this spoiled brat is off
to do a little "sunroof dance"....if i have the energy, i'll stick if out
for a "leather seats" dance too.....geez!  just kidding!  it's only 10 am!
more later.....
