> Monday, September 17, PSCo filed an application with the Colorado
> Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to decrease the Gas Cost Adjustment
> component of its sales rates, which, if approved are expected to
> become effective October 1, 2001. This GCA decrease reflects the
> decrease in market price of natural gas.  In addition to the decrease
> in the gas sales GCA, a slight increase in the GCA applied to gas
> transportation service has also been requested, to reflect an increase
> in the upstream transportation and storage charges applicable to gas
> transportation customers.
>
> The proposed new GCA's requested by PSCo are:
>
> CG:	GCA = $3.504/Dth, for a new total CG commodity rate of
> $4.481/Dth.
> IG:	GCA = $3.285/Dth, for a new total IG commodity rate of
> $3.749/Dth
> TF/TI:	GCA = $.055/Dth (current transportation GCA = $.047/Dth)
>
> A Transportation Summary Sheet of the proposed rates is posted on the
> Web site for informational purposes.
>
> IMPORTANT REMINDER:  Remember that GCA costs noted above and in the
> Transportation Summary Sheet reflect the proposed rates filed by PSCo,
> and are subject to revision and/or approval by the PUC before rates
> become final.  Notice identifying the new GCA rates will be posted on
> this website upon PUC final approval.
