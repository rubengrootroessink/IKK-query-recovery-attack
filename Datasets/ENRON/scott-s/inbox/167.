   Blindness.

[From Latin caecitas, from caecus (blind).]

It's that time of the year again, the time when we feature odds-and-ends.
One-of-a-kind words. Words that are unusual, picturesque, whimsical,
esoteric, or intriguing. And like all the creatures in this world, these
words serve a purpose (as shown by the accompanying citations). They make
our verbal universe richer and more diverse. So here they are. We've coaxed
them out of the dictionary -- it's not often that one finds them in the
open -- and we hope you'll welcome them in your diction.           -Anu
