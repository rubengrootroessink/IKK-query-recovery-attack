Hello All-
 
I thought I'd drop everyone a line to say hello.  I'm glad to hear that everyone is on celebrity watch.  I've seen none, let alone anyone with bang me against the headboard beauty.  I am a minor league baseball player though, does that count for anything?
 
I'm sorry to say that I won't be able to make it back for the fourth of July festivities, but I'm always there in spirit.  If anyone has a burning desire to see Lexington Kentucky, I'm your guy. It is the tabacco capital of the world.
 
I just wanted to tell everyone hello, and that I miss everyone.  As insane as that may be.
 
I hope everyone is well.  take care of each other, we are all we have sometimes.
 
Take care.
 
 
JON
