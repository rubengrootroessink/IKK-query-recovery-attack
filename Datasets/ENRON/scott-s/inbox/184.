blue rinse (BLOO rins) adjective

[From the hair-dye used on grey hair that produces a blue shade.]

   "If the race comes down to a former officer married to an aristocrat and
   blessed with four children - or a quiffed Spaniard with a gay past and a
   soft line on drugs, who do you think the blue rinse brigade will choose?"
   Jonathan Freedland, Still Lost in the Wilderness, The Guardian (London),
   Jul 11, 2001.

Ever wonder how our vocabulary is colored by many hues of a rainbow?
Often we use colors as symbols for ideas, thoughts, and concepts but

with intellectual inclinations. A bluenose is a prude but a blue blood is
aristocratic. Even a computer would go crazy trying to make sense of this.
