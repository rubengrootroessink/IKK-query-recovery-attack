Hey Susan,

I think my brother and his wife might be at Laura
Jahnke's wedding as well - you might say hello.

School starts in 1 1/2 weeks.  I am really excited
about starting.  I should learn at ton, and get
exposed to all sorts of things which will be helpful
in the coming years.  My parents are driving up today
to help me move into my new place, closer to school(my
parents are awesome!).

Rx-Saver.com is nearing completion.  Hopefully, we
will open for business in a few weeks.  Starting a
business has been more of a challenge than i expected.
 Just when things get rolling, a challenge raises its
ugly little head.  But, I love it.  It is alot more
fun than a 9-5 job, and there is alot more potential
to hit a homerun.

Anyways, I hope life is going great!  Say hello to
Allan and Lisa for me.


Have fun,
Paul
