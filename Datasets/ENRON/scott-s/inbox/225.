MR. MAXIMILER: Our column from ~OneTravel.com's~ own Frugalist, Bob Jones,
features up-to the-minute tips and deals that maximize your air miles and save
you travel cash.  Read on for this week's "Mr. Maximiler" tip!

Best Offers I have sniffed out!

For those of you longing to return to nature, Interior Secretary Gale Norton
announced that  all entrance fees to national park areas will be waived during
Veterans Day Weekend, November 10, 11 and 12, 2001, to allow Americans the
opportunity to seek solace and inspiration from the Nation's parks, monuments
and memorials. Demand is expected to be high for camping/RV spots so
reservations, at those parks that require them, are recommended to ensure a
site.  With the exception of a few parks in Hawaii, Florida and California,
expect tent camping to be on the chilly side.  Remember that leading hotel
chains like Marriott also have properties in or near the parks for travelers
who don't want to get that close to nature!  For park location information
visit: http://www.nps.gov/parks.html

Airlines continue their deep discounts but remember too that they are cutting
capacity system wide so those seats on sale now may not be available too much
longer.  The wise traveler will purchase now and watch fares.  If they do go
down, request a voucher for the difference.  You won't get a refund per se but
you will have a year to apply the voucher to another flight.

Many carriers have discounted award travel as much as 25%.  On Northwest, that
20,000-mile domestic award is available at 15,000 miles for a short time and
European and Asian destinations have also been discounted substantially.
Consider cash and miles combinations as well.  All carriers have added award
seats to flights, so now is the time to cash in those miles.

Finally, virtually all airlines and hotels are allowing their frequent
flyer/guest members to donate miles or points to relief efforts.  If you have a
few thousand miles in an account you may never use, donating them will allow a
volunteer to fly free to New York or wherever they are needed.  There is no tax
advantage in donating, only satisfaction!

See you on a flight soon,


Bob
