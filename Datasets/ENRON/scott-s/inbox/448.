Susan:
Are you there? Drop a line as you have time. I am here for the next week or
so in England. I was in Milan Italy for fashion week and then 4 days later
was in Portland as I picked up a priest friend from there and brought him
back to England for a 2 week holiday. Thus, I think I have spent more time
on airlines than I have with my two feet placed on the ground. How are you?
What are you up to? Are you working or still lamenting a potential change?
Let me know...
Best to you,
Tobin
p.s. I will be in Houston for the entire month of April and half of May.
Shall we do lunch?
