FIVE BEAUTIFUL  WOMEN, and you are one of them!!! 
Facts on Figures; 
There are 3  billion women who don't look like supermodels and 
only eight who do.  
Marilyn Monroe wore a size 14.[IMAGE]
If Barbie was a real woman, she'd have to walk on all fours due 
to  her proportions. 
The average woman weighs 144 lb. and wears between a  12-14. 
One out of every four college aged women has an eating!  disorder.

The models in the  magazines are airbrushed -- not perfect! 
A psychological study in 1995  found that three minutes spent 
looking at a fashion magazine caused 70% of  women to feel depressed, 
guilty, and shameful.   
Models  twenty years ago weighed 8% less than the average woman.

Today they weigh 23%  less.

~Beauty of a Woman~  
The beauty  of a woman is not in the clothes she wears, 
The  figure she carries, or the way she combs her hair. 
The  beauty of a woman must be seen from her eyes, 
Because that  is the doorway to her heart, 
The place where love resides.  
The beauty of a woman Is not in a facial mole,  
But true beauty in a woman is reflected in her soul.  
It is the caring that she lovingly gives,  
The passion that she shows. 
The beauty  of a woman 
With passing years -- only  grows.

An English professor  wrote the words, "Woman without her man is nothing," on the blackboard and  directed the students to punctuate it correctly. 
The men wrote: "Woman,  without her man, is nothing." 
The women wrote: "Woman! Without her, man is  nothing." 
The Images of Mother 
4 YEARS OF AGE ~ My Mommy can  do anything! 
8 YEARS OF AGE ~ My Mom knows a lot! A whole  lot!
[IMAGE]
12 YEARS OF AGE ~ My  Mother doesn't really know quite everything. 
14 YEARS  OF AGE ~ Naturally, Mother doesn't know that, either. 
16  YEARS OF AGE ~ Mother? She's hopelessly old-fashioned. 
18  YEARS OF AGE ~ That old woman? She's way out of date! 
25  YEARS OF AGE ~ Well, she might know a little bit about it.  
35 YEARS OF AGE ~ Before we decide, let's get Mom's opinion.  
45 YEARS OF AGE ~ Wonder what Mom would have thought about  it? 
65 YEARS OF AGE ~ Wish I could talk it over with Mom.  
***Please send this to at least  five phenomenal women today in 
celebration of Women's History Month. 
If  you do, something good will happen.... YOU will boost another 
woman's  self-esteem!
