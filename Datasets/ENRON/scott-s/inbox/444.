how's it going?

just thought i would check in and see how you were?  you were
right, my mom said i did received the $1100, pre-tax, so actually
$700. oh well, at this point money is money. priya just found out
she was accepted to SAIS at Johns Hopkins so she has been
frantically looking on the internet for jobs for me in DC. it is one of
the places that I am interested in relocating to but am also looking
in boston and northern california as well. have you heard anything
from the KC, Cincinnati, or Chicago jobs?

hope all is well. i miss you all tons. oh, starting to finalize travel
plans for the summer and it looks like niclas and i are going to be
meeting in Europe somewhere for about 5-7 days. he's mentioned
skiing in the swiss alps and italy? i am sure i wont be lucky
enough for it to work out, but we will see. talk to you soon,
