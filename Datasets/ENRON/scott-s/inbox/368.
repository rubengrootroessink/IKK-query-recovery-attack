Got a delivery failed message when i tried to send this to you the
first time. somehow it went to susan.m.sc@kis.ernet.in???

i am sorry to hear about purget, but it sounds like things may work
out for the best regardless. i am so excited for you and very
excited to visit you in seattle when i return. i must say that you did
a very bold thing turning down UBS without having  another job
lined up. but i agree with you, its definitely best to make a clean
break. are all the employees that agreed to stay with UBS going to
 relocate or stay in houston? did lenhart accept? how long did you
have to make your decision? are you still working at enron for the
moment? if so, how long can you stay on and still receive a
paycheck?  what does your mom think about seattle? i cant
believe you could be there by march. sorry for all the questions...
just excited to hear.

yvette and erik have accepted jobs at Huber and are staying in
houston, but signed the contract to sell there house before they
accepted the job. so they will be moving into an apartment.
anything else going on? keep me posted and send me your hotmail
 email address. i have it in my address book on hotmail but havent
been able to access the internet in a week. just want to be able to
find you if you leave enron soon.

talk to you soon, take a look at the pictures below on my first week
 in kodai.

lisa

These are pictures taken by Priya's brother. So the first 37 pictures

from our first couple of days in Chennai and then the first week in
Kodai.
