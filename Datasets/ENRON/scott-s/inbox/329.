hi... heard anything from puget sound energy??? how are things at enron?

hope you have a good weekend... do you get monday off as a holiday? i wish we did, but we don't...

saw a great movie last night- the royal tennenbaums. it was awesome.

emailed rob (guy that emailed me and asked me out from last saturday) anyway, he emailed me monday afternoon and i finally emailed him back on wednesday afternoon. IT WAS THE WORLD"S DORKIEST EMAIL EVER... i am so embarassed. basically i said no that i didn't want to go out with him, and now i feel horrible about it. oh well, since my email was so dorky he probably doesn't want to go out with me either...

take care
bonnie
