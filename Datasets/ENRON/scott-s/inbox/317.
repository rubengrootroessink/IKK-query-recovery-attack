Hey Susan,

How are you? I've wanted to catch up with you and see how things are going?
I wanted to find out about your job etc? Also, I am not sure if you decided
on your living situation but if you are looking, one of my roommates is
going to move out at the end of this month and I wanted to see if maybe you
were interested. It is a 3 bedroom cute house on the border of Montrose and
West U. Give me a call when you get a chance or send me your number and I
will call you. 713-522-5881.

Talk soon,
Sarah
