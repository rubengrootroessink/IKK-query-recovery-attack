Suz, I'm using both addresses since I don't know which one is current.
Guess that you had a good time at Monique's and did a little skiing.  Hope
that work is going as well as it can under the circumstances.  We are
flying and having a good time out here.  It's fun to work with the Navy
again.  This time it is the carrier  Abraham Lincoln and her battle group.
 mostly we make attacks on her and fighters like F-14s and F-18's come up
and intercept us.  We are carrying electronic pods which jam and deceive
their radars and everybody gets some good training.  Yesterday I just got
out to the area which is south of San Clemente island off the coast of
Southern California and had a generator failure.  I was with another A-4
and he continued the mission.  I went back to Pt.Mugu and jumped into
another airplane and got back out for the second and third runs.  The whole
thing just about wore me out but it felt good to get the mission
accomplished.  Love, Dad
