kangaroo court (kang-guh-ROO kort) noun

   A mock court set up with disregard to proper procedure to deliver
   a judgment arrived at in advance.

[Origin unknown.]

   "`This is a kangaroo court,' the Australian coach, Don Talbot, told
   Vlaskov in a heated argument on the pool deck. `Do you know what that is?
   It's a farce.'"

the heart - and to keep them in parallel vigor one must exercise, study and
love. -Karl Viktor von Bonstetten, author (1745-1832)
