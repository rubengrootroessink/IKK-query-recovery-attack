corybantic (kor-i-BAN-tik) adjective

   Wild; frenzied; uncontrolled.

[After Corybant, an ancient priest of Phrygian goddess Cybele, who
performed wild ecstatic dances in her worship.]

   "The radio is nothing but a conduit through which pre-fabricated din
   can flow into our homes. And this din goes far deeper, of course, than
   the eardrums. It penetrates the mind, filling it with a babble of
   distractions, blasts of corybantic or sentimental music, continually
   repeated doses of drama that bring no catharsis, but usually create
   a craving for daily or even hourly emotional enemas."
   Aldous Huxley, On Silence, 1946.
