ok girls...sue, haven't called you bk yet w/ the 411, and kates, haven't
heard back from you after i left the past couple messages, so this could end
up being a collosal disaster, but went ahead and made reservations at Garson
for 7:45 tonight.  it's on hillcroft btwn westheimer and 59...super scary
area on "wrong" side of westeimer, but have reliable sources who've raved,
and since was close to Hart, have driven past several times and looked safe,
  persian food, which is i'm not exactly sure what.....but supposed to have
good meze, kebabs, and persian ice cream.  hope y'all are in.  could be
supremely embarrsaing to dine solo in semi-formal middle eastern restaurant
w/ no bar....luby's or cafe express is one thing....a belly dancer's haunt
is quite another!  chat soon, mes amis...
