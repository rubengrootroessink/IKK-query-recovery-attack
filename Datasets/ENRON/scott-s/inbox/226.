Managing Your Money
Back to Basics
Taking the first steps toward financial freedom starts with the 
basics. Whether you bank online, via ATM, phone, in person, or any 
combination of these, becoming familiar with the accounts and 
services your bank offers will make it easier to find the loans, 
credit cards and even home mortgages that are right for you. By 
learning what your bank has to offer, you can take advantage 
of the financial products and services that best fit your 
financial needs.
Banking Essentials
It's important to learn the features of even the most basic 
banking products. Finding the right account is easy when you've 
done the research. 
Checking and Savings Accounts
Most people have checking and savings accounts, but may not know 
that the types of accounts available vary widely. Everybody's 
financial needs are different, and that's why it's important to 
choose the account that fits the way you want to bank and enhances 
your lifestyle. 
? Checking Accounts. Do you keep a steady amount of money in your 
checking account? Is your checking account your main financial 
services account? The right checking account has it all - 
convenience, flexibility and fast, easy access to your money. 
Checking accounts give you the freedom to write checks against 
your account balance and to have access to your money through an 
ATM or online banking. And since everyone's financial needs are 
different, there are a wide variety of checking accounts available, 
including interest bearing or non-interest bearing, all of which 
are FDIC insured. From accounts that offer you free checking with 
direct deposit to low-fee student accounts to top-of-the-line 
financial relationship accounts, there's a checking account 
that fits your lifestyle. 
? Savings Accounts. Whether you're saving for a new house or a 
child's college education, the best way to achieve your financial 
goals is to put money away each month. An Automatic Savings Plan 
makes saving even easier by automatically moving a pre-determined 
amount of money between your accounts. Savings accounts are interest- 
bearing accounts with low minimum balance requirements. They are 
a convenient way to save for the future and most savings accounts 
can be used as overdraft protection for your checking account. Find 
out more about the variety of savings accounts  available to you. 
? Time Accounts (CDs)
If you're planning for a vacation or saving for the future, time 
accounts , also known as certificates of deposit, are a solid choice for your 
savings needs. Time accounts offer guaranteed rates of return for a fixed term, 
flexibility in length of investment term and are eligible for FDIC insurance. 
ATM, Check, and Credit Cards
Both ATM cards and check cards provide convenient access to your 
accounts, allowing you to withdraw cash, make deposits and transfer 
funds through an ATM. An ATM card  also offers you the ability to make 
purchases using your Secret Code or Personal Identification Number 
(PIN) at participating merchants. With a check card , you have 
expanded purchasing power at merchants worldwide that accept either 
Visa
 (or MasterCard
), depending on which logo is displayed on your 
card. Whenever you use a check card or ATM card to make a purchase, 
the purchase amount is always deducted from your checking account 
and detailed on your monthly statement for easy record keeping. 
Additionally, there are several types of credit cards , which give 
you the convenience and financial flexibility of paying for your 
purchases over time, depending on your credit limit. With all of 
these choices, there is definitely a card (or cards) that is right 
for you. 
Investment Accounts
These days, most people have some sort of an investment account. 
However, the type of investment account people choose depends on 
their comfort level and goals. Whether you're new to investing, 
experienced at managing your own investments, or simply want to work 
with a financial consultant, there are options for you. 
? Full-service brokerage. New to investing? Prefer talking to 
somebody in person? An experienced financial consultant can help. 
It's not always easy making investment choices on your own. Working 
with a financial consultant , you get the tailored advice you need to 
make informed investment decisions. 
? Online brokerage. If you prefer to manage your investments on 
your own, online brokerage  gives you the dynamic tools to manage your 
portfolio, research the marketplace, assess your opportunities and 
make the right decisions. 
? Wells ShareBuilder. With Wells ShareBuilder  you can invest in 
stocks and index shares in regular intervals, weekly or monthly. Over 
time, you will automatically build your portfolio share by share.

Managing Your Financial Accounts
? Online Banking Basics

phone, or online? As many people have discovered, banking online is 
the fastest, most convenient way to access all their accounts, manage 
investments, transfer funds and pay bills - all with just the click 
of a mouse. 
? Online account access. Need to check your balance from work? Want

balances and transactions, transfer funds, pay bills online, and

Managing Your Money
If you're like most people, you work hard and strive to achieve your 
dreams. It's important to build a financial foundation to ensure you 
arrive where you want to be. Here are a few tips on how you can make 
smart decisions about your financial future. 
Taking Control of Your Finances
It's not how much you make, but what you do with your money that 
matters. Cutting out a few minor expenses can make a big difference 
in your savings. There's no better way to stay out of debt than by 
tracking your spending and sticking to a budget. A budget can help 
you control your finances, decrease your debt, and build a strong 
credit history. Where do you spend your money? Determining your cash 
flow is the first step in creating a successful budget. 
Building Your Credit and Controlling Debt
Managing credit can be a challenge. But a good credit rating is key 
to many financial decisions. Learning how to establish and maintain 
good credit  can make a big difference in your savings. Understanding 
how to manage your debt can empower you to take charge of your 
financial future. The quality of your life is directly linked to how 
well you manage your credit and debt.
