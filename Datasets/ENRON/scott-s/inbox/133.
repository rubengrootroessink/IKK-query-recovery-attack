annus mirabilis (AN-uhs mi-RAB-uh-lis) noun, plural anni mirabiles (AN-i
   mi-RAB-uh-leez)

   A remarkable year.

[From Latin annus (year) mirabilis (wondrous).]

   "We suppose it's anti-climactic that consumer sentiment sank like a stone
   to a two-year low, and Xmas sales were not very cheery. So, all in all,
   sigh, Y2K wasn't exactly an annus mirabilis."
   Alan Abelson, Up & Down Wall Street: Unfond Farewell, Barron's (Chicopee,
   Massachusetts), Jan 1, 2001.
