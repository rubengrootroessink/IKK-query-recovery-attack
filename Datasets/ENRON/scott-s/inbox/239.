Hey Girls,
I've been to Baba Yega a few times, just there last week, nothing too exciting.   I would love to try La Vista. Never even heard of that.

Is anyone else as ecstatic as me that today is Friday? Yahooooooo.

Girls,

We are planning to meet at Yvette's (2035 Milford) at 6:30. I believe everyone recalls how to get there. I have 2 places in mind, but please bring other suggestions. I just figured none of us have been to either of these: 

1. Baba Yega

2. La Vista

Heather, 
email me and let me know if you would like me to pick up your t-shirt for tomorrow for you. Also, we are supposed to be at the SSK House at 8 am and it is right down the street from me so let me know if you would like to go together.

see you all soon,
lisa
