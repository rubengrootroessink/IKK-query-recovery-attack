hey- got the grandparent dinner changed to weds, so am free for festivities
tues night.  i vote a little happy hour, good dinner, then whatever. know
you working folk keep different hours, plus i have another "mole appt" noon
on weds, so can't be ultra shameful night before....guess we should call
kates and you-know-who....
appt tomorrow morn at 11 am, and me be out and about most of day, but will
try to call early morn or late afternoon.  was thinking maybe ruggles or
ouises or something- i know, i know- am ultra-predictable, but i'm the bon
vivant leaving and it's all about ME, ME, ME!  could really get used to
that....
