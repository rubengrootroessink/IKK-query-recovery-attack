The Latest Update For Travelers - Travel Information Center
-----------------------------------------------------------
With AA.com Travel Information Center, you will find all the travel information you need before you leave home.  Find out about starting your trip, checking bags, documents you need, international travel, and changes at the airport.  For example, remember to allow more time for check-in, security screening, and boarding.  Please plan to arrive at the airport two hours prior to scheduled departure for domestic flights and three hours prior to scheduled departure for international flights.  Visit www.aa.com/travelinfo for information to ensure your next trip goes smoothly.http://www.aa.com/travelinfo 
Additional Cockpit Security
---------------------------
The first wave of aircraft equipped with new, FAA-approved, American Airlines engineered, cockpit security devices are now flying. By early November the entire fleet will be outfitted with these new devices which incorporate a locking mechanism as well as reinforced metal bars. These plans are being shared with other U.S. carriers as passenger security continues to be our highest priority.http://www.aa.com 
Carry-On Baggage Requirements
-----------------------------
Carry-on luggage is limited to one bag plus one of the following personal items: purse, briefcase, small backpack or laptop computer. At some airports, carry-ons may be more restricted. All other luggage must be checked at curbside or at the ticket counter. Passengers exceeding the carry-on limit will not be allowed through the security checkpoint. Ensure that none of the following are in your possession: 
 - Knives of any length or description, including catering cutlery 
 - Cutting instruments of any kind including carpet knives, box 
   cutters, and other folding retractable blades, regardless of 
   blade length or composition. This includes those less than four 
   inches in length, regardless of whether they are metallic or 
   non-metallic 
 - Items such as ice picks, straight razors, elongated scissors 
   and knitting needles (safety/disposable razors, such as Bic and 
   Gillette, are allowed)
