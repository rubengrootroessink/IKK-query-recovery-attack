look at you...such a hoax spreader...ha
   anyway, i was so busy yesterday i didn't have a chance to do anything
   about it anyway. so no harm, no foul.  how are you doing?  as for Enron,
   as you well know our stock's not doing so great these days, but i'm not
   overly stressed...we are still a sound company and shouldn't have any
   difficulty rebounding from this to a certain extent....i'm actually
   thinking about buying in to a greater extent at these levels.
   can't wait to hear how your preparations are coming along...for the
   wedding and the move.  btw, have you set a firm date yet?
   talk to you soon,
   Susan
