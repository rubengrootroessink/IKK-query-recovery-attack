Hi kids.  Kevie started school this week, and he moved closer to campus.  His new contact information is:
 
2635 Portland Street, Apartment 5
Los Angeles, CA 90007
 
(213) 764-0150
 
Kevie now lives in South Central (aka Da 'Tto aka the Ghetto), so don't break your necks coming visit his new place.  He's always up for hanging out away from his new location, though.
 
Actually, the new place is not too bad.  I have a roommate who I have not yet met, but the apartment is adequate.  The bars on the windows are a lovely touch.  For those CU alums in the LA area, I'm planning on hitting Grunyuns in Manhattan Beach on Sunday night to watch the Buffs game, so hopefully you other kids can make it, as well.  Talk at ya'll later.
 
-Juno
