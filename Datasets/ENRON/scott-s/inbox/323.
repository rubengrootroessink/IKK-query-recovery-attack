no worries about the change of address form. priya told me i could
do it online and have already done so. thats great news about the
apartment. hope you are hanging in there at enron. i hope the
interview goes well in seattle and that you are excited about it.
please, please email me once you get back from seattle and let
me know how everything went. good luck and i am thinking about
you.
