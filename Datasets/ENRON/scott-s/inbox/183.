hello all at home.   have been packing for almost a week now, and am taking
a break so that i can feel sorry for myself about having to leave london so
quickly.  wah, wah.  is prob. for the best- do not think americans are
winning the prize for 'most popular' in europe right now.  that said, i'm
leaving tuesday morning on Continental flight #5, arriving at IAH at
4:15pm....i know it's morbid, but if any of y'all were flying in the next
week, i'd want to know your flight numbers in case something happened.  am
sure all will be fine, and soon you can all come take advantage of my
employee discount at the wal-mart on 1960 (remember:  christmas is just
around the corner- shop early!) if anyone gets a chance to pick up this
month's vanity fair, please do (no, not the harry potter one...)  I know
i've tried this before and was met w/ much resistance and whining, but i'm
trying again anyways. i know it may be overkill, but the section on new york
was brilliant, and the essays (both the intro by david halberstam, and esp.
toni morrrison's eulogy) were breathtaking.  even those of you who could
care less about the latest cruise 'n cruz gossip should give this issue a
chance...ok, am off.  take care, all, and will chat soon-
e
