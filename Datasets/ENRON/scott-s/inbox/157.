I moved, ergo I now have a new number.  512-502-2416.  Some of you will notice that is the same number as Andy Lorino.  Well, you're right.  We have decided to stop fighting the feeling and have reunited as roommates.  Not since the Fall of 1995 at the much ballyhooed Moore Hill Dormitories (aka Club Mo' Hill) has there been this much blatant towel popping.  Feel free to celebrate my return to the Castle or as Alex refers to it, The Royal Court, in whatever manner you see fit..  My cell phone is still the same 512-940-3821.
