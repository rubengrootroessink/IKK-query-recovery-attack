The new function will be available to externals tomorrow.  Lavo has asked us to not suspend our products once they have been activated.   The market submits orders and the orders can't be seen on the screen unless your product is active.  Stack manager now has the option to leave a product active while clearing all bids and offers.  Please try not to use this new function unless you have to.  

YOU MUST GO INTO EACH OF YOUR PRODUCTS AND SET THE BUSINESS HOURS.  I WOULD USE 730 TO 1600 FOR MOST PRODUCTS AND 730 TO 1030 FOR CASH.  

Thanks,
Mike
