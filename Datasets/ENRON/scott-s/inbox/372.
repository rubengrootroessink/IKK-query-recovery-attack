I just wanted to send out a quick reminder about our Philanthropy event
tomorrow night at St. Lukes at 7:00 in toom R25.  Julie and I went shopping
yesterday and purchased all of the treats for inside the care packages.  We
are making 150 carepackages for KIPP kids (about 3 each), so it should take
about an hour.  We will also include inspirational notes inside each package
to personalize the packages and make them fun.  If you have any quote books
or the like - please bring them so that we can include sweet quotes and
thoughts for these kids so far from home.  It should be a fun time!
Remember:

Wednesday, Feb 20
St. Lukes (Westheimer and Edloe)
7:00 p.m. in R25

Thanks!
Ashley and Julie

ps - if you have already let me know that you can not attend, I've got you
down.  If you haven't let me know, please send me a note.

Subject: NCL Philathropy Event


Hello again to everyone!

I wanted to send out a reminder e-mail regarding our philanthropy event on
February 20th.  We will be creating care packages for KIPP Academy students
who are in boarding school.  Many of these kids have never been away from
home - so we create small study packs filled with snacks, supplies and notes
to encourage them.  Originally we were planning on holding this event at
KIPP Academy however we were able to get a room at St. Luke's church.
Please meet at St. Luke's at 7:00 p.m. on February 20th in room R25.  If you
have any quote books or inspiration books - please bring those along as well
to help with the notes.  If you have any questions, please don't hesistate
to send me an e-mail.

See you on Wednesday!
Ashley

- St. Luke's is located on the corner of Edloe and Westheimer.  Edloe is
just west of Kirby.
