Hey. 
Very interesting weekend.  Whistler was amazing.  Danny and DJ were supposed to go home sunday morning, but they didn't leave.  They called sunday and we went out.  Tons of fun.  I was dancing with dj and I talked them into staying another day.  We skied all day monday and they left.  It is a bit weird, I still don't know if dj is really that interested.  I really thought so on sunday (dancing, etc), but hard to tell when we were skiing.  Maybe because danny was there that it was a bit weird.  I will see dj at a party sat. night so more story later. 
I will get the name of the army guy.  It is Josh, but I always have a hard time remembering his last name... 
Any news from Seattle co? 
bye.
