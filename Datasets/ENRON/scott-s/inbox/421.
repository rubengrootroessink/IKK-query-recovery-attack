Circe (SUR-see) noun

   An irresistibly charming woman.

[After Circe, an enchantress in Greek mythology. She was known to lure
sailors to her island and turn them into swine.]

   "In Giuseppe Tornatore's new film, Malena, the Italian actress Monica
   Bellucci plays a heroine who is every man's dream and every woman's
   nightmare. The young and gorgeous Malena Scordia, who is marooned in
   her husband's village in Sicily when he goes off to the second world
   war, is an unwitting Circe, driving men to lust and their wives to
   plot revenge."
   Laura Winters, Arts: Part Siren, Part Muse, All Trouble, The Guardian
