Come as you are

				Mix and mingle with other professionals, and
see the monumental "Lansdowne" portrait of George Washington by American
painter Gilbert Stuart.

				Now on view at the MFAH, the portrait made
news in 2001 when the owner, who had lent the painting to the National
Portrait Gallery at the Smithsonian Institution since 1968, decided to sell
it.  The Donald W. Reynolds Foundation of Las Vegas donated $30 million to
allow the National Portrait Gallery to purchase the painting.

				The MFAH is the first stop on the national
tour  George Washington: A National Treasure.

				Special mini-tours of the Lansdowne portrait
of George Washington will be available at 7:00, 7:30, & 8:00.
		As always, receive discounted memberships and 15% off at the
gift shop during Fine Arts Friday.
