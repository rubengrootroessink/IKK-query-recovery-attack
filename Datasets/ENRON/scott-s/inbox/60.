Susan,
Continental     #531 leaving Tuesday, Aug 14 at 9:20 to San Fran at 11:15
Korean Air      #24 leaving San Fran at 1:00 and arriving in Korea at 4:50pm on Wednesday, Aug 15
That's outbound for you.  I think they made the reservation wrong on the return, I'll have to go back today and check it out.
