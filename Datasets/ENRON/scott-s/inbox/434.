MR. MAXIMILER: Our column from ~OneTravel.com's~ own Frugalist, Bob Jones,
features up-to the minute tips and deals that maximize your air miles and save
you travel cash.  Read on for this week's "Mr. Maximiler" tip!

Best Offers I've sniffed out!

Well, the airlines continue to duke it out over fares leaving travelers
wondering how they can continue these deep discounts.  USA Today and Reuters
News Service have both referred to the sale as a "Street Fight."  Just last
week, the carriers seemingly did away with three day advance fares, which
impacted business travelers more than leisure, but today those fares are back
with some of the three day round-trip fares as low as $189 plus the obligatory
and ever present taxes and fees.

Two for One fares last seen on Southwest some four years ago have returned and
American Trans Air continues its "Buy Three, Fly Free" promotion. JetBlue is
flying coast to coast for under $250 with taxes and fees and the other small
carriers, like National, Vanguard and AirTran all have some sort of promotion
going.

In most cases, tickets must be purchased no later than the first week in April
and are good for travel through July with a couple of carriers allowing returns
by Friday, August 3, 2002.  Many of these exceptional fares are available at
http://www.onetravel.com

The hotel industry is continuing its rebound with some unique offers.  Hyatt
and American Express are offering a $50 "Spending Money" reward for a two-night
stay at participating properties.  Rates per night range from $62 at the Hyatt
Regency Tech Center in Denver, to a not so reasonable $370 per night at the
Hyatt Regency Grand Cayman Resort & Villas.  You must be an American Express
cardholder and a member of Hyatt's Gold Passport program to take advantage of
the offer.  Be sure to ask for offer code GIFT2U when making reservations.

See you on a flight soon,

Bob
