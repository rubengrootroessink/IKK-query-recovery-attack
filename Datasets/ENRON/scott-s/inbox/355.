> > embarrassment when the checker got on the intercom
> > and boomed out for all the store to hear, "PRICE CHECK
> > ON LANE THIRTEEN, TAMPAX, SUPER SIZE." That was bad
> > enough, but somebody at the rear of the store
> > apparently misunderstood the word "Tampax" for
> > "THUMBTACKS." And, in a business-like tone, boomed

> >
> > A teacher noticed that a little boy at the back of

> > and not paying attention. She went back to find out
> > what was going on. He was quite embarrassed and
> > whispered that he had just recently been circumcised
> > and he was quite itchy. The teacher told him to go
> > down to the principal's office. He was to phone his
> > mother and ask her what he should do about it. He did
> > it and returned to his class. Suddenly, there was a
> > commotion at the back of the room. She went back to
> > investigate only to find him sitting at his desk with
> > his penis hanging out. "I thought I told you to call
> > your mom." She screamed. "I did," He said, "And
> she
> > told me that if I could stick it out till noon, she'd
> > come and pick me up from school."
