glad the trip was so smashing.  am pouting rt now b/c have to finish next
law paper by tues- while evryone else travels.  liz and kerrie are in
stockholm, mom and dad in colorado...me stuck, w/ pulled groin muscle, and
am hobbling around like a circus freak.  sounds like kates is off to dallas.
  think she's definitely ready for a chge of scenery.  and she's waited long
enough!  would seattle be a potential destination?  could you do your same
job there?  i guess so.  could be really fab- i'm up for anyone from the grp
offering alternative vacation destinations.  everyone always raves about
seattle- isn't that were the begining of the ashley judd film double
jeopardy takes place?  gorgeous!  plus, if it has austin-like qualities, how
could you go wrong?  like kates, you may be in need of a chge of scenery-
even if it were just for a yr or so.....what will prob happen is kates will
move to dallas, you'll move to seattle, and the next day i'll be offered
curator position or dream art law job in houston starting at about $
100,000+......then it will be me and the marrieds alone, stuck in houston!
NB kitchen has been totally renovated- mom said it looks totally different,
but can't really imagine it.  may be meeting brit and arden in NB sept 15-
save the date just in case it becomes a big party..... ok, am off.  rented
the house of mirth...again.  i really liked it for some reason....ok, chat
soon-
