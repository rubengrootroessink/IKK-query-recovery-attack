I noticed that a few of you had revised/validated several curves and that your work was not accurately reflected on the Progress Summary sheets. These sheets are an essential reporting tool for project management. Please update the progress sheets with your recent work or communicate your progress to Kathy Kelly so that she can perform the updates on your behalf if necessary. As a reminder, the sheets are located at O:\CurveValidation\Estate Reporting\Gas organized by region (Progress Summary - East, Progress Summary - Texas, etc.).

Also, when you complete a template by either revising or validating the ERMS pricing data, please remember to place an "R" or "V" in the yellow box near the top of the template. 

Thanks for your help.

Regards,
Mike
