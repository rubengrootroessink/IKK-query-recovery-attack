I am forwarding this because I don't know if you will get the other one or
not.  If you get it twice then delete the other one I guess.

 Or at least 20%% of her is. How do *we* know? She just took
 TheSpark's famous BITCH*TEST.

 So what about *you*? Is it true that you blame everyone but yourself for
 your problems?

 Your bitchiness seems dangerously high, but there's only one way
 to know for sure:

	  Take the BITCH*TEST
	  http://www.thespark.com/bitchtest

 Take the test, discover your inner (or outer) bitch, and then
 check your score against Rebecca Misetr's and all your other friends'.
