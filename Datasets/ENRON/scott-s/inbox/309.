Susan:
Great to hear from you! Glad to see we have a connection. What do you do
for work nowdays? Curiosity has me. You are, of course, always welcome to my
tiny little dormitory/flat at anytime. Also, I am travelling as much as
possible around Europe and the former Eastern Bloc countries. I am trying to
find a few business opportunities, etc. etc....so, if you want something
"different" look no further.
I DO have instant messenger so look me up. :) This will be a good way to
stay in touch. I will be in the US from the 19th of Dec. through the 27th.
Half the time will be spent in Houston with Cara and the other half (at
Christmas--imagine that) will be with my parents.
Met Cara in New York this weekend. It was a grand time. We wanted to see one
another and we figured that NY was the best compromise for us in terms of
distance, availability, etc. Saw the devastation briefly and now I want Rudy
Giuliani to run for Prez. More on that later. :)
Will you be in Houston the 19th through the 21st of December? Lunch perhaps?
Also, Thanksgiving I will be here with Cara. You are more than welcome at
anytime now later or a few months from now.
OK, I am rambling as I haven't slept in 24 hours thanks to the flight from
NY. Drop a note as you have time.
Best,
Tobin
