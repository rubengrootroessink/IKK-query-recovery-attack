Hey Susan, long time no hear.  I hope things are going well with you.  I'm sure by now you're a star trader on the West desk.  I've been in London for the past 5 months in enron Credit (Nick's group).  I'm scheduled to return to Houston next month.  I know I only call you when I need something, but I was wondering if I could ask you some questions about the market.  Is it ok if I call you later today?
