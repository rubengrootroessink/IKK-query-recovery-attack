Hi Kenyan runners,  here is some useful information  concerning the 20k this week end and what pace you should run.
You should run the first 10K at that  pace then pick up, if possible, the second 10K.
 
Marine Corps, New York, or San  Antonio should use the faster sheet 
All other runners use the slower  sheet.  
Thanks
 
Jon/Sean/Jerry
