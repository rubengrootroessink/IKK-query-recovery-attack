ok- we're playing phone tag.  got home fairly early last night-and sober,
might i add- but had left my computer on, and didn't hear the phone- pretty
lame, huh?  am now going into overdrive on the paper- or about to.  have an
appt w. one of my advisors next week,and need to have approx 15,000 words
(1st 3 chapters) done.  i have yet to check out a book (but- damn!  this
vacation/ oh, yeah....marathon....to bordeaux will be fab- am making appts
at the coolest wineries and little scenic restaurants!)  have perhaps missed
my calling as a travel agent.  anyways, will try to call you later- am going
to attempt to remain in the flat w/o distractions all weekend- should be
able to get in touch SOME time....chat soon-
