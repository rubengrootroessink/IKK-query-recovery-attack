ok- am really planning on calling tonight.  have to admit, the movies on tv
the past two nights have sent niki and i into professional veg mode til the
wee hours....are you going to susan edwards' wedding?  i think we were all
invited- hate that i'm going to miss it- think it's going to be fun!  first
night bk to boot camp at almost 100%...not bad, but still stuck in the
beginner's grp.  looks like a bunch of people who didn't quite make it into
athletics in jr high....i feel like an olympic athlete in comparison.  won't
be such an ego boost to head back to advanced grp and last place in every
wind sprint.  am currently watching old ally mc beal re-runs.  i REALLY like
that british guy, brian, she dated for a while....damn!  he's precious.  ok-
mind is wandering.  you'll be VERY excited to hear of my latest whim- cross
stitching.  but cross stitching w/ a purpose, of course.  M & D's 30th
anniversary is in december, and thought i'd do an anniversary sampler for
it.  will prob take me that long just to do the border....ok.  am off.
again- baring any fabulous , unmissable tv options, will try to call later!
