from what i hear, her high rise appt is pretty much the reason for the
season, so to speak.....although she did sound a bit inspired about the
possibility of doing some buying work in the silver dept, which would
involve trips to the orient.  all this is second hand of course- was severly
hung over when niki talked to her on sun after the party.  i was a shameful
girl sat night- although i inflicted damage on no one but myself.  had mini
pms-induced temper tantrum/self-pity party at the bar w/ niki, her friend,
nima and wenus, then wandered off to catch the night bus at trafalger
square....needless to say, was so drunk i passed out on the bus, and slept
waaaaaaay past my stop, ending up somewhere in acton- the equiv of living in
lakewood, then waking up in hempstead.  had 3 pounds to my name, no money on
houston acct to pulse $ out, and at 4 am, not too many cabs haunting the
gangster area of acton.....was a pitiful scene.  had to bribe a mini cab to
drop me off as close to ladbrok grove as 3 pounds would take me, then
hobbled home about 3 miles in heels, whiney and drunk.  very sad.  no
matter.  am almost done w/ dreaded paper!
well, maybe it is time for susan to explore new territories.  am pretty damn
sure there are other alternatives to enron in the seattle area that offer
job description close to what you're doing or want to do.  enron is not the
only game in town- and shouldn't hold you back from having new experineces
or making inspired decisions.  could warrant some research.  keep me posted.
back to smae old, same old.....chat soon- will try to call after finish said
paper later tonight.
