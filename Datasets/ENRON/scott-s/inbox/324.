Susan,
These are some pictures of my friend Jimmy that I keep telling you about.  He went to the Naval Academy and is now out somewhere in the middle of the ocean.  Maybe when he gets back he'll move to Houston or Seattle...  He's perfect for you.  Tall, cute, and very smart.  How was the interview??
Katy

To Everyone:

Attached are some pictures of Jimmy that just arrived from the Teddy
Roosevelt.   I think they carry one of everything they own with them on
these flights.  Hope you all enjoy these photo's.   Jimmy is handing an
enlisted man a mock check for $49,000+ dollars for re-enlisting in the
nuclear surface fleet.  The sailor will get 1/2 in cash and the balance
over the term of his enlistment.
