damn!  just got kicked off aol for the umpteenth time today....tried to
figure out this messenger business, but only have aol messenger, i think.
and after all the dissertation-induced computer trauma this last moth,
installing it could prove to be the proverbial straw, you know.....good to
hear about chuck sr.  was worried about him when i heard about the missing
planes.  am sure both chucks will be ok.  gals enron was spared as well, but
what an ordeal.  geez.  makes becoming a carpenter and living in NB look
reaaaaaly attractive right about now.  city, schmitty.  a beer out on the
deck rt now would be super cathrtic, i think.  i know y'all aren't getting
all the graphic footage there that we are here of the middle eastern
countries' parades and parties in the streets rt now.  so unreal and
sickening.  how can people be that evil?  really sad- you know michael?
loud, london michael?  turns out he just flew back here from a meeting mon
morning at the WTC, and his entire US office of cantor fitzgerald was based
on the top 5-10 stories of the WTC.  no one has been heard from.
terrifying.  it's just so isolated and lonely here rt now.  want to be home
so badly, and i get so funky in these kinds of situations:  you know, ultra
sentimental and nostalgic and weepy.  and matt didn't help- he did one of
those "i'm so worried that our friends/family don't know how loved and
appreciated they are" bits, and that's one of those deep-rooted fears that
you just never want to deal with because we count on lisa to be the
"hallmark" aspect of our grp, and no one else.  i chalk it up to a
frightening lack of estrogen amongst us all....either way, not something i
want to start thinking about, b/c it's just opening pandora's box, and can't
stop.  still hoping to make it home on fri or sat, and matt said he's going
to houston on fri for a business thing, so maybe we will all get to chill
this weekend if the stars are alligned.  have fingers crossed.  ok- bk to
the bbc and cking on flight possiblities....chat soon-
