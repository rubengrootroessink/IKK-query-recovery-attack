Hi Guys-
Just wanted to let you know that my hotmail account will be the best way to reach me for now.  Our company shut down last Thursday- so now I am out of a job.  Great time to be looking.  Anyways- it was a total shock and we were quite upset.  My parent company is trying to find something for me there- but its not looking too good.  If you hear of any leads-please let me know.  Also- anyones addresss that I missed- can you send them this way.  I don't have Amanda's, Lisa's, or Courtney's (work).  Also- I am not sure if I have the right address for Courtnie.  So- let me know.  I'll keep you updated.  
Thanks-
Laura
My home # is 281.583.7820 and cell is 832.452.3247
