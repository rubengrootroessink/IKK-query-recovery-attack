Hi Girls,
I'll be Mrs. Susan Williams in 8 DAYS!  I'm so excited and nervous and stressed all at the same time.  This has been a hectic week not only with wedding errands but also trying to get my life wrapped up before I take off for three weeks.
Before I leave town, I want to make sure you all know what's going on 
next weekend. I think most of you (with the exception of Katie) will be 
getting in town on Friday.  If anyone will be in Park City by 11:00 am on 
Friday, I'd love for you to come to the bridal luncheon my grandmother is 
having for me.  If you can make it, let me know.  Friday night I've got the
rehearsal at the church at 5:30.  The rehearsal dinner starts at 7:00 
pm at the Marriot.  Dinner will be very casual.  You may want to wear or 
bring something with long sleeves because dinner is outside and it gets 
chilly at night (low 60's) in Park City.  After dinner, it will be time to ditch the families 
and head to Main Street where we will have our choice of two or three bars 
-all very laid back hole-in-the-wall type places.
On Saturday morning, I would like to have breakfast with all of you.  I
want to spend some qualit! y time with you before the day gets hectic.  
The location is to-be-announced.  I'll scope out a good breakfast place 
when I get to Park City.  Unfortunately, we'll have to eat early - around 
9:30am -so if any of you have to much fun on Friday night, I'll know why  you
aren't there ; )
The wedding will be at 3:00pm.  The church is on Main Street (at the 
top of the hill).  The parking situation is kind of confusing  because you 
can't park on Main Street and the parking lot is on the street that runs 
behind the church.  You may want to check the church out ahead of time so you 
know where it is.  The ceremony will be approx 1 hour.  The reception is at
Stein Eriksen Lodge which is up the mountain a few miles.  It doesn't 
start until 5:00 which gives you some time to kill between the wedding and
reception. This will give Eric and I time to take pictures at the 
church wi! thout having to miss any of the reception.  I figure by the time you
freshen up, drive up to Stein Eriksen (which is a beautiful drive up 
the mountain) and  you can have a  drink at the bar it will be five 
o'clock.
After the reception, you are on your own....
Now my request....Can everyone let me know when they are getting into 
town and where they are staying?   I've got that information for most of 
you but I just want to verify.  Also, Kelly and Laura - if your husbands 
want to play golf on Friday morning with Eric and his friends, let me know.  
FYI - If anyone wants to treat themselves to a message,manicure/pedicure,etc.
while in Park City the number for the Belle Salon is  (435)655-8250.  
My mom and I leaving on Monday.  If any of you want to get in touch 
with me, my cell phone is the best place to reach me (832)515-3066.  
I can't wait to see all of you next weekend!  I'm so excited that all of you are coming to the wedding.  Each of you is very special to me and it means so much to have you there on my wedding day.
Love,
Susan
