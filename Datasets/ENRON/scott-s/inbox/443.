mogul (MO-guhl) noun, also moghul or mughal

   A powerful or influential person; magnate.

[After Mogul, one of the Mongol conquerors who ruled India from 1526 to 1857.]

   "By now, you may think you know everything there is to know about Santa
   Claus. However, what you don't know could fill his bottomless bag of
   toys. Hardly any of the popular tales about Jolly Old St. Nick have been
   updated since the 1940's. The world has changed considerably since then,
   and so has Santa. Thanks largely to some disenchanted elves whose
   contractual nondisclosure agreements recently expired, we now have
   firsthand accounts of what it is like to work for the world's most
   reclusive toy mogul."
