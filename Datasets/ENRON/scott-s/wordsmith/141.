louche (loosh) adjective

   Of questionable character; dubious; disreputable.

[From French louche, cross-eyed, from Old French lousche, feminine of lois,
from Latin lusca, feminine of luscus, one-eyed.]

   "They wanted her to be a dancer, but the teenage Bardot fell in with the

   Adam Sweeting, Channel Surfing: Zouzou Exposed, The Guardian (UK),
   Nov 7, 1998.

more than the straight-eyed ones. In this week's AWAD we look at more such
