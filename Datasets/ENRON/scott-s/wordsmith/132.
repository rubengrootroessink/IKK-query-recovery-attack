choleric (KOHL-uhr-ik) adjective

   Easily irritated or angered: hot-tempered.

[Middle English colerik, from Latin cholericus, from Greek cholerikos.]

   "Continually throwing off cuttings from its mown prose, the novel delights
   in word-play. Umeed is, at times, an angry photographer, `a choleric
   snappeur,' who resents playing second fiddle to the brilliant spectacle,
   and final demise, of Ormus and Vina: `second-fiddling while Rome burns'."
   James Wood, Books: Review: The Ground Beneath Her Feet by Salman Rushdie,
   The Guardian (London, UK), Apr 3, 1999.

This week's theme: words ending in eric.

Apologies to Eric Cartman, Kenny, and all South Park fans. Yesterday I erred
in spelling Eric Cartman's name, and in suggesting he has more lives than a
cat (that applies to Kenny, not Eric). Irate South Park fans as far away as
Tokyo have corrected me. -Eric Shackle (eshackle@ozemail.com.au)

When a man wants to murder a tiger he calls it sport; when the tiger wants
to murder him he calls it ferocity. -George Bernard Shaw, writer, Nobel
laureate (1856-1950)
