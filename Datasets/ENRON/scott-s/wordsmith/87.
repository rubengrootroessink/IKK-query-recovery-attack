daltonism (DAWL-tuh-niz-em) noun

   Color blindness, especially the inability to distinguish between red and
   green.

[After John Dalton (1766-1844), English chemist and physicist, who gave us
Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures. He studied his own color blindness as
well.]

   "He (Theodore R. Weeks) refers to 'national daltonism: the extreme
   difficulty nationalists had... in perceiving and appreciating the
   viewpoints or needs of members of other nationalities."
   Stephen D. Corrsin, Nation and State in Late Imperial Russia (book review),
   Canadian Slavonic Papers (Ottawa), Sep-Dec 1999.
