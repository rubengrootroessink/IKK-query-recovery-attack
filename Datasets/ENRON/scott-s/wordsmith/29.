   "What Highet calls a tricolon we may today call a palilogy, the deliberate
   repetition of words and grammatical presentations, a sort of parallelism
   in threes."
   Bret L. Keeling, H.D. and `The Contest': archaeology of a Sapphic gaze,
   Twentieth Century Literature, Jun 22, 1998.

Correction: The quotation for last Monday had wrong attribution.
It should have been:

    Growth for the sake of growth is the ideology of the cancer cell.
    -Edward Abbey, naturalist and author (1927-1989) [A Voice Crying
     in the Wilderness, 1989]
