garbology (gar-BOL-uh-jee) noun

   The study of a society or culture by examining what it discards.

[Garb(age) + -logy.]

   "Though garbology remains a relatively unplumbed subject, several colleges
   and universities offer courses that look at what people throw away and how
   it reflects who they are."
