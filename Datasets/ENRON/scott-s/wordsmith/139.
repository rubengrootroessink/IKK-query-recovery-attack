polemology (po-luh-MOH-uh-jee) noun

   The science and study of human conflict and war.

[From Greek, polemos, war + -logy.]

   "Polemology begins, in other words, with a frank recognition of the
   overpowering superiority of the strong over the weak, and thus of the
   likelihood of defeat."
   Simon Joyce, Resisting Arrest/Arresting Resistance, Criticism (Detroit),
   Spring 1995.

This week's theme: words from war.

As often as Herman had witnessed the slaughter of animals and fish, he
always had the same thought: in their behaviour toward creatures, all men
were Nazis. -Isaac Bashevis Singer, writer, Nobel laureate, (1904-1991)
