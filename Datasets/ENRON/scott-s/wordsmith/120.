obsequy (OB-se-kwee) noun

   A funeral rite or ceremony.

[Middle English obsequie, from Middle French, from Medieval Latin obsequiae,
alteration (influenced by Latin exsequiae, funeral rites) of Latin obsequia,
plural of obsequium, compliance.]

   "When (Anthony) Powell died, in March of last year, at the age of
   ninety-four, the New York Times Book Review devoted a Bookend column to
   the obsequy."
   Christopher Hitchens, An Omnivorous Curiosity, The Atlantic Monthly
   (Boston) Jun 2001.

All zoos actually offer the public, in return for the taxes spent upon
them, is a form of idle witless amusement, compared to which a visit to the
state penitentiary, or even a state legislature in session, is informing,
stimulating and ennobling. -H.L. Mencken, writer, editor, and critic
(1880-1956)
