anchorite (ANG-kuh-ryt) noun, also anchoret

   One who lives in seclusion; a hermit.

[Via Middle English, Medieval Latin, Late Latin, Late Greek, from Greek
anakhoretes, to withdraw.]

   "The use of money is the purest act of faith; no anchorite who has
   followed a vision into the desert has acted on an idea as far-fetched as
   our belief that if we put a dollar in a machine we will be drinking a
   Diet Coke in a minute."
   Mary Gordon, We Are All Spendthrifts Now, The New York Times, May 29, 2000.
