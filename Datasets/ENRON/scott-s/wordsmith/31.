Parkinson's Law (PAHR-kin-suhnz law) noun

   Any of several satirical observations propounded as economic laws,
   especially "Work expands to fill the time available for its completion."

[After Cyril Parkinson Northcote (1909-1993).]

   "According to Murphy's Law, this column will have a mistake in it.
   According to Parkinson's Law, it will take you as long to read this
   column as the time you allot to reading it."
   Rob Kyff, This Column Obeys All Laws, The Hartford Courant, Nov 11, 1998.

This week's theme: syndromes, paradoxes, laws, and principles.
