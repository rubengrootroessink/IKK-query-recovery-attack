Young Turk (yung turk) noun, also young Turk, young turk

   A young member of a group who advocates reforms within an established
   organization or one who attempts to wrest control of it.

[After members of a reformist and nationalist party in Turkey during early
20th century.]

   "`These young Turks in the LDP are still on the fringe,' said Hideaki
   Kase, a historian and political commentator. `So it's my bet that
   Hashimoto will win, because he controls the apparatus.'"

If I seem to take part in politics, it is only because politics encircles
us today like the coil of a snake from which one cannot get out, no matter
how much one tries. I wish therefore to wrestle with the snake. -Mahatma
