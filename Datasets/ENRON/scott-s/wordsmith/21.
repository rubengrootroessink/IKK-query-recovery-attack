excelsior (ik-SEL-see-uhr) noun

   Slender, curved wood shavings used especially for packing.

[Originally a trade name.]

   "In a glint of needle light, of grass seeds, dew flecks, a friend is
   throwing her voice
   While far inside a grainy heaven a butcher's apron ripples its dried
   blood in the wind.
   The bark strippings, excelsior, the panicles of the garden. In the midst
   of summer a friend cuts greens and places them in a bowl as if they were
   fronds.
   A friend is a vinegar - and now, pearl-shaped, in clusters, faces among
   her face,
   A globes rise on the lawn, each above a root of recriminations."
   Garden solstice. (poem), The Antioch Review, 1 Jun 1996.
