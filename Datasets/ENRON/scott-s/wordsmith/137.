casus belli (KAY-suhs BEL-y, BEL-ee) noun, plural casus belli

   "RAI's news operations are still heavily politicized, with every channel
   following a political bent and news editors' appointments becoming a
   casus belli for political battles."
   Yaroslav Trofimov, RAI Chief Turns State Network Into Modern Firm,
   The Wall Street Journal, Dec 13, 2000.

This week's theme: words from war.
