neoteric (nee-uh-TER-ik) adjective

   New; recent; modern.

[Late Latin neotericus, from Greek neoterikos, youthful, from neoterios,
comparative of neos new.]

   "Electronic books, they say, are asking them to make a mental
   transition -- to veer from their ingrained appreciation for the printed
   books that fill our nation's more than 120,000 public, academic and
   special interest libraries -- to depend on a neoteric gizmo that disrupts
   the sacred union between man and book. Welcome to the changing world of
   publishing."
   Charlotte Moore, Bedtime for binderies? The Austin American Statesman
   (Texas), Jul 28, 2000.

The man who is denied the opportunity of taking decisions of importance
begins to regard as important the decisions he is allowed to take. -C.
