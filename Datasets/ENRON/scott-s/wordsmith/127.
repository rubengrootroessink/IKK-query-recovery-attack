[Extension of the literal meaning of the term bad hair day, a day when one's
hair is, well, hairy.]

   "Having survived the first ugly rumours of Friday, September 11 - which
   really was a bad hair day for Dickie - he must have thought that the
   worst was over. Unfortunately, he was dead wrong as the share price
   continued to crumble."
   Ian Kerr, A Week in the Markets, Euroweek (London), Oct 9, 1998.
