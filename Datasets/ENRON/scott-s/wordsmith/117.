potatory (POH-tuh-tor-ee) adjective

   Pertaining to or given to drinking.

[From Latin potatorius, from Latin potatus, past participle of potare,
to drink.]

The word potatory has little to do with potatoes, unless the drink in
question happens to be aquavit. Two more familiar cousins of today's
word are potion and potable.                                  -Anu

   "An expert's guide to the potatory pleasures of port, sherry, montilla
   and madeira."
   James Ainsworth, Vat City, Punch (London, UK), Feb 23, 1990.
