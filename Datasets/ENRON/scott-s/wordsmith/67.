theophany (thee-OF-uh-nee) noun

   An appearance of a god to a person.

[Medieval Latin theophania, from Late Greek theophaneia, Greek theo-, +
-phaneia, to show.]

   "Any mundane reality could yield a theophany, if approached with reverent
   imagination: a place, a rock, a tree, a man or a woman."
   Karen Armstrong, Divinity and Gender: a God for both sexes,
   The Economist (London), Dec 21, 1996.
