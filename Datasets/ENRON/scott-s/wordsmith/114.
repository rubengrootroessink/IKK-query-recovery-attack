   "What is the Citadel? Sir, it is a fortress of duty, a sentinel of
   responsibility, a bastion of antiquity, a towering bulwark of rigid
   discipline, instilling within us high ideals, honor, uprightness, loyalty,
   patriotism, obedience, initiative, leadership, professional knowledge and
   pride in achievement -- from the school handbook."
   Rick Reilly, What is the Citadel?, Sports Illustrated, Sep 14, 1992.
