sextet (seks-TET) noun

   1. A group of six.

   2. A group of six singers or musicians, or a piece of music composed for
      them.

[Alteration of sestet, influenced by Latin sex, six.]

   "With the local hockey sextet locked in a Stanley Cup series it would be
   loyal to stop by and pick up a six-pack."
   Dick Kreck, Raise a Glass to Avs, The Denver Post, May 18, 2001.

The word sextet has nothing to do with sex, unless of course, the six people
in question engage in some questionable calisthenics. That's what the English
language does--often leading us on only to make things limpid in the end.
There we go again. Take the word friable, for instance. All evidence leads
us to suggest this word could be used to refer to raw potato chips. But in
truth, something friable is that which could be easily crumbled. Well, it
could be used to refer to potato chips, after all. This week's AWAD visits
these red-herring words, words with meanings that are not the first things
that come to mind.                                                    -Anu
