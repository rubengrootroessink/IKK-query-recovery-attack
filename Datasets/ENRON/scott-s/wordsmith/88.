   declared verboten anywhere near the operating room, and his practice was
   limited to treating toe-nail fungus."

It's said that a picture is worth a thousand words. What if a word itself
is a picture? That's the idea behind what I call WordPix--words presented
so that they do their own show-and-tell. With each word this week, I'll
give you the URL of an image that shows its WordPix. Without further ado,
let's see some words and let them talk about themselves. Instead of giving
citations from newspapers, magazines, and books, this week I'll write usage
examples myself.                                                      -Anu

............................................................................
The best cure for worry, depression, melancholy, brooding, is to go
deliberately forth and try to lift with one's sympathy the gloom of
somebody else. -Arnold Bennett, novelist (1867-1931)
