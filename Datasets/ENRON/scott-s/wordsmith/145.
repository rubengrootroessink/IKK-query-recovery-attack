anile (AN-yl, AY-nyl) adjective

   Of or like an old woman.

[From Latin anilis, from anus old woman.]

   "The desire of AngloSaxon Australians to avoid `giving offence' through
   the spoken word is amply seen in compulsory speech codes in the ABC and
   the universities. They are, in (Robert) Hughes' words, `the anile
   priggishness of the Puritan marm, lips pursed, seeking nits to pick.'"
   Andrew McIntyre, PC? Non merci!, IPA Review (Melbourne) 1996.

   "Before she is able to act, a bell tolls. The anile amah brings her
   a card."
   Ruth Eshow Upton, 42 Across Meets 18 Down, The San Francisco Chronicle,
   Feb 5, 1989.
