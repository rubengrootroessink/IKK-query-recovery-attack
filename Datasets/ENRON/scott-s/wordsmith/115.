argus (AHR-guhs) noun

   An alert and observant person; a watchful guardian.

[From Greek mythology. After Argus, a giant with 100 eyes who was sent to
watch over Io. He was later killed by Hermes and after his death his eyes
transformed into spots on the peacock's tail.]

   "Arnold (Schwarzenegger) knew immediately that `Total Recall' needed
   an Argus-eyed director who could maintain control over complicated visual
   effects, extravagant futuristic sets, dangerous stunts, etc. -- while
   also demanding good performances from his actors."
   Bill Jones, SCREEN GIANT Muscles Parlayed Into Stardom, The Phoenix
   Gazette (Phoenix, Arizona), Jun 2, 1990.
