oscitant (OS-i-tant) noun

   1. Yawning, gaping from drowsiness.

   3. Inattentive, dull, negligent.

[From Latin oscitant, present participle of oscitare, to yawn : os, mouth
+ citare, to move.]

   "What is disquieting is that with the consolidation of one-party control
   in the late 1920s after the Mexican Revolution, the portrait of the
   Mexican changes to one unusual in political representation, oscitant and
   weary."
   Paul Rich, Guillermo De Los Reyes, Mexican Caricature and the Politics of
   Popular Culture, Journal of Popular Culture, Summer 1996.

This week's theme: words to describe people.
