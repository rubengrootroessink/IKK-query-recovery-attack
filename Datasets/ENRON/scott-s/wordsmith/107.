autocrat (O-tuh-krat) noun

   A ruler with absolute power or a person who has unrestricted authority.

[From French autocrate, from Greek autokrates, auto- self + -krates, -crat,
ruling.]

   "The plot is driven by the desire of the city's autocrats to relocate the
   enclave of black citizens away from the center of town by buying up the
   homes they live in and evicting them."
   Bruce Weber, A Youthful Wolfe Filled With Outrage, The New York Times,
   Sep 15, 2000.

Pleasure is very seldom found where it is sought; our brightest blazes of
gladness are commonly kindled by unexpected sparks. -Samuel Johnson,
