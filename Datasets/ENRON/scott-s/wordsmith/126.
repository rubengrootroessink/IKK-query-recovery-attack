full monty (ful MON-tee) noun, adjective; Also Full Monty, full Monty

   1. Everything that's needed or possible or appropriate: the whole nine
      yards.

[Origin unknown.]

   2. Complete nudity.

[Popularized by the 1997 movie of the same name where a group of unemployed

A couple of weeks ago, the folks at the Oxford English Dictionary decided to
add a few hundred words to the dictionary. That would not be newsworthy in
itself -- the online edition permits incorporation of new words easily and
the editors of the dictionary continually assay new words alphabetically
and add them to the dictionary. What's unusual is that this time they decided
to add the words out-of-sequence, words that otherwise would have to wait for
their turn to be anointed into the lexicon.

Unlike French, the English language needs no nanny's nod to call a word
a word. If a word fills a need, it is a word, no matter whether it's in
a dictionary or not. Still, the inclusion of these words in the OED,
the most venerable around and a true lex icon, does help give writers
their editors' imprimatur to use these words. As can be expected, a
disproportionate number of these new words hail from the Internet. Many
of these terms may appear slang, but we should remember that today's
revolutionaries are tomorrow's conservatives. So use these words in your
writing and conversation with the official seal of approval from the OED.
