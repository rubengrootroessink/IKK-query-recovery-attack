gyrovague (JYE-ro-vayg) noun

   A monk who travels from one place to another.

[From French, from Late Latin gyrovagus gyro- circle + vagus wandering.]

   "Other forms of religious life on Mount Athos fall outside these two major
   categories and include anchorites, hermits who live alone in secluded
   cells or in groups of two or three in remote houses with their own
   chapels, and gyrovagues - itinerant, mendicant monks."
   Plutarchos Theocharides, The Holy Mountain, UNESCO Courier, Jan 1998.
