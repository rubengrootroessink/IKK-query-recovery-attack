prad (prad) noun

   Horse.

[By metathesis from Dutch paard, horse.]

   "`Just send somebody out to relieve my mate, will you, young man?' said
   the officer; `he's in the gig, a-minding the prad. Have you got a coach
   'us here, that you could put it up in, for five or ten minutes?'"
   Charles Dickens, Oliver Twist, 1838.

This week's theme: words formed by metathesis or transposing letters.
