pedagogue (PED-a-gog) noun, also pedagog

   1. A schoolteacher; an educator.

   2. One who instructs in a pedantic or dogmatic manner.

[Middle English pedagoge, from Old French, from Latin paedagogus, slave who
supervised children, including taking them to and from school, from Greek
paidagogos : paido-, boy + agogos, leader (from agein, to lead).]

   "They also taught that `persistent perversity provokes the patient
   pedagogue to produce particularly painful punishment.'"
   Roger Kimball, Anything Goes, Nothing Matters, Forbes, Oct 4, 99.

No horse gets anywhere until he is harnessed. No stream or gas drives
anything until it is confined. No Niagara is ever turned into light and power
until it is tunneled. No life ever grows great until it is focused,
dedicated, disciplined. -Harry Emerson Fosdick
