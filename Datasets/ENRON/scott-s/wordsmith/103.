chaplet (CHAP-lit) noun

   2. A string of beads.

[Middle English chapelet, wreath; from Old French, diminutive of chapel
hat, from Medieval Latin cappellus, from Late Latin cappa, cap.]

   "What was on Hannibal's mind as he drove his elephants over the Alps?
   Looking good, apparently, because on Hannibal's head was a wig, which
   he wore into battle to cover his lack of locks. Julius Caesar used
   his chaplet for the same purpose, the comb-over having not yet been
   discovered."
