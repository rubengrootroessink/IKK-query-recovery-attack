I spoke with Rob Foss this afternoon and he's under the impression that "Evie 
and the Indicated Producers" (a new singing group) are not going to file a 
rebuttal to PG&E's proposal for Wheeler Ridge.  He promised to circle back 
with Burlington tomorrow and, like Regis Filbin, see if that's their final 
answer.
