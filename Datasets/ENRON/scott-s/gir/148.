Good Morning Susan, I presume Norm is asking the same type of question of
each of the upstream pipelines. If his "game" is to balance upstream firm
rights to specific Socal points , TW should be in an excellent net position
against the other parties. Let's review, PG&E has an estimated 160 to 210
mmcfd of firm KRS shippers currently, EPNG has a FERC documented problem and
arguably only 540 @Topock and 1210 @ Blythe, Mojave has 0 mmcfd at Hector
RD. as documented in this proceeding, Kern uses a specified firm delivery
point in their shipper agreements, therefore shippers like Reliant at SCE'S
old Coolwater Plant would specify the Coolwater Station as their delivery
point and not Socal Wheeler Ridge. I estimate the upper end of Kern shippers
specifying Wheeler Ridge as their firm delivery point is 325 mmcfd.  I am
available today, to discuss these matters. I'll be out tomorrow.

Another approach to Norm's question is to form our response as : Under the
current Socal windowing structure, primary rights "into" Socal are
unavailable.

Mark,IGS
