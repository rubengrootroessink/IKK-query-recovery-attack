Susan , Good morning. Here are my thoughts for additional items to be
included in the Transwestern Opening Brief.

1)Assurance that all intrastate capacity will be made available : Socal
shareholders are put at risk for Backbone transmission capacity revenue &
any unutilized capacity will be made available to the market. This seemed to
be of particular interest and sensitivity to the judge. Further, placing the
utility at risk for unused resources was a listed promising option.

2)Existing Socal noncore customers are given 2 unique opportunities to
select their receipt points & the core intrastate set asides guarantee that
the core is fully protected : this suggest the transition will be smooth.
Developing clear procedures for allocating capacity was an additional
promising option.

3) On the topic of implementation, can we say in TW's experience the
timeline outlined in the CAS is viable . While Socal will have to "create"
an unbundled backbone system, the CAS allows sufficient time for Socal,
Socal customers and other interested parties to be prepared and fully
participate in the unbundled backbone system.

Call when you have a chance. Mark,IGS
