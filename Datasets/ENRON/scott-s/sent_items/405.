Hello Susan!

I feel terrible that I haven't talked to you in so long.  Third year of med
school is a little on the crazy side!  I've been wanting to call you, but for
some reason, I can't find your phone number.  I called information, and tried
to call a Susan Scott in Houston, but I wasn't sure if it was the right one of
not.  (There were several)  So, just email your phone number to me (and your
address if you don't mind--I don't have your current one), and I will call you
tomorrow sometime--I'm on call tonight, so I won't be home until very late!

I hope you're doing well and not having to work so, so hard these days!  I
miss you and all the girls--we need a reunion soon!  Take care!

Love,
Elizabeth
