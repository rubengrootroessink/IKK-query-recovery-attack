no offense taken and i'm agreed on the camaraderie aspect...just don't think excessive drinking is an appropriate response.

and, though i don't think you intended to, please don't EVER imply that i would crawl in a corner and be afraid...not in my nature

you're right, the events of this past week were tough, but on reflection these events have not made me want to crawl in a corner and be afraid- just the opposite - they made me realize that life is fragile and short.  so why not enjoy it in the company of some good friends?

No offense :-)

Hate to be the party pooper but, based on the events today and this entire week, a shot contest is the last thing on my mind.

Little Woodrow's downtown sounds good.  Any objections or other suggestions?
