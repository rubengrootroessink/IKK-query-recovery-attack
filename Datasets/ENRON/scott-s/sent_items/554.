Hey...

so i've given everyone the heads up around here regarding my decision, and surprisingly enough they have been on the whole very supportive.  Frank told me this was a "good thing" for me and that he was jealous.  And Steve actually said he was proud of me.  anyway, it's gone much better than i had expected.  still don't know exactly what happens to me now.  so we shall see what the next weeks hold in store.  

i'm still checking into lodging etc. for this weekend/early next week.  i can fly in saturday or sunday, but maybe sunday morning would be best.  i figure we could touch base and plan the next couple days (plus, i wouldn't have kept you up all night chatting saturday night so that you're exhausted for work sunday).  then we'd have all day monday and tuesday and i'd probably fly back on wednesday....just a thought, feel free to share you own.

drop me a line when you get a chance,
SueBob....finally living up the name!
