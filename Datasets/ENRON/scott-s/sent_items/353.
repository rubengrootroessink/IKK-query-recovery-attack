a really good time

rainbows)- just gorgeous

Thanks Bonnie...we're staying at the Mayflower Inn.  I'll give you a
call
on your cell phone when we get to town.  It may not be until Friday
though
since our plane gets in late...but I'll call none the less.

Susan

   hey i emailed one of my friends and asked her about kayaking,etc.
when
   i get a chancce i will look up some internet sights that might have
info
   on that sort of thing in seattle. if you have a sec, you may want to
try
   seattleinsider.com--- i think they are supposed to be pretty good and
   helpful

   i havent talked to luke yet, so i dont exactly know my plans for the
   weekend unfortunately....

   i am thinking that i will head to whistler on early saturday morning,
   and that way i can go to dinner with you and your friend on friday
   night, or head out and have drinks, or both, or whatever yall want to
   do!

   the weather is supposed to be great this weekend, but with seattle
you
   never know.

   my MAJOR SUGGESTION is that you bring some sort of light jacket for
   sure, or a pullover or something. it gets so darn cold at night-
believe
   me you will be glad.  plus on the ferry ride over to san juans it
could
   get kind of chilly if you are sitting outside.

   ive already given you my cell phone number i think (206.851.9177)
   definitely call me when you get in town on thursday night or on
friday.
   the number i have given you is my cell phone and you can call me
anytime
   on it. if i dont answer, i check it frequently and you can leave a
   message and ill call you back.

   very exciting to have visitors from texas. see you friday hopefully.

   oh, where are you staying?
   bonnie

   Hi Bonnie,

   How are you doing?  Lisa said you'd broken your foot recently and
have
   been stuck on crutches...which I'm guessing is no fun when you're
riding
   public transportation.  Anyway, I was writing to see if you might
have
   some suggestions of things to do and places to go while in Seattle.
One
   of my co-workers and myself are flying up Thursday for a long weekend
in
   your fair city and were hoping to get a few pointers.  I hope you're
   still enjoying things as much as you were a few months ago.  It looks
   like you may have changed jobs already, which I trust is a good thing
   for you.  I'm very anxious to see the city and all it has to
   offer...there is a part of me that has always thought I'd like to
live
   in the Pacific Northwest for a while (so this will be a little bit of
a
   research trip for me).  If you could start thinking of suggestions
for
   restaurants, bars, outdoor activities, etc. that would be great, and
   maybe if you're in town we could get together for a meal or a drink.

   Thanks a bunch,
   Susan
