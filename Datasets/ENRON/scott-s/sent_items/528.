hey...

i actually just filled my change of address form out this morning...i figured you'd already done yours.  i'm leaving for the airport straight from work tonight and don't get back until sunday night.  i can fill it out monday, but if you would like it done before then you may want to try and tap someone else for the job.

the reason monday is important is b/c someone wants to rent our place and i've told the complex that i'll be completely out by the end of the day monday.  so starting monday night i'm back in northwest houston and w/out a mail key.  on the bright side, i'm getting a fair amount of money back from the january rent (which means we're cool rent wise, i.e. you needn't give me any $ for january).  

i do have an interview in seattle tomorrow morning...i'm nervous and excited.  i've been studying a bunch for the last week and a half or so to try and prep myself.  i think i'm more nervous about not liking the job rather that liking it or not doing well in the interview.  also, i'm going to see "kiss me kate" the musical w/ my friend up there so that should be fun.

i'm glad to hear that things seem to be going so well for you there, you sound awfully busy.  keep us posted on all your many activities.  

Sue

-- i knew you were going to take like a fish to water w/ this thing.....never should've worried so much.

Sue,

this is an inconvenience but just realized that i never filled out a
change of address for our apartment. if you get a chance could you
please fill one out for me. i would ask my mom but it has to come
from our post office off of W. Alabama.

Heard you have an interview in Seattle this weekend. Good luck
and let me know how it goes.
