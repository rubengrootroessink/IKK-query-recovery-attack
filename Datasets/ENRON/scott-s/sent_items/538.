don't have much to pass along....i've been looking into some places to stay if i come up.  i may run a few of the names by you to see what you think or if you know anything about them.  

i've got to get out of my house SOON!!!  mom woke me up this morning to see if i "needed to get up and start getting ready"....she'd heard my alarm go off and evidently didn't realize my extensive use of the snooze button.  she then followed me out to the car to give me directions on how to drive to work (i.e. which lanes to use...ha)  even though i'd made it just fine the day before.  on the plus side, my meals are being made for me and there is always cheese and crackers.

talk to you soon,
SueBob
