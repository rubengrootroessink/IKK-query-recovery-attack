No worries....We can chat tonight.  I wanted to talk to you about President's Day weekend anyway, and I need to do some research on that front today.  Thanks for thinking of me though (if it makes you feel any better, I forgot it was my birthday yesterday morning until Mom gave me my present).

Susan,

Sorry we didn't call last night.  I thought about your
birthday the night before and reminded Chuck that we
HAD to call you on Thursday.  Chuck started Air
Assault School yesterday, and that's turned everything
upside down.  We'll call you tonight.  Sorry we missed
you last night!

-Chris
