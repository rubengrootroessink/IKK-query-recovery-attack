good luck w/ the car shopping!!!  i'm anxious to hear what transpires...

as for me, i was off last night and maybe if we have some time this weekend i can fill you in on what's happened to me over the course of this week.  but the bright spot in the whole thing is that dinner last night reminded me of the person i've been and how far i've come in the last 10 or so years of my life...and i think it gave me the extra shove, push or whatever you want to call it to really end the rotten situation i've been mired in.  i don't know that the dinner was to blame completely for my sudden "illness", b/c a large portion of it may have been psychological...i had an appointment for a final chat last night, and i think i was getting sick just thinking about doing what i had to do...but i did it, on my terms and there weren't any warm fuzzies or expressions of disappointment on my part and i rejected his suggestion of a shift to friendship....so there it is, now it just up to me to "stay sober" so to speak and kick the habit for good.

talk to you soon,
Sue

you beat me to the punch....but that's just because your up and at work
before god.  i know exactly what y0u mean, and is funny, b/c i think we kind
of all sense that kind of thing about each other.  i could tell you were
"off" last night, and felt bad the whole ride home worrying about it.  i
say, let it ride.  sometimes you have to force yourself to buck up (ie, KK)
and sometimes you have to wallow a bit.  the key is finding the healthy
middleground.  takes a while i'm sure, but practice makes perfect.  and it
IS friday.....maybe will pick you up later in dad's (oops!  i mean MY!)NEW
CAR...god knows what it'll be....but 25 yr old can't look an interest-free
gift horse in the mouth.  plus- i would kiss the ground he walked on if it
meant i didn't have to deal w/ car salesmen.  ok- this spoiled brat is off
to do a little "sunroof dance"....if i have the energy, i'll stick if out
for a "leather seats" dance too.....geez!  just kidding!  it's only 10 am!
more later.....
