Vegas trip was pretty interesting.  Give me a call tonight if you get a chance.  Try the cell phone any time after 4:30 (Houston time) - 
(713) 775-6472.

If I'd spent any longer  than three days in that town I'd be dead right now.  I think the earliest I made it back to my room was around 6:45 am.
