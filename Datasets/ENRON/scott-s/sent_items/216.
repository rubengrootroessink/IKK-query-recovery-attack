Well...I would certainly be up for a little travel.  The following locations looked interesting to me.  

Biarritz, Dinard, Carcassone, Perpignan, St. Etienne or Nimes in France.  Cork, Kerry, Shannon, or Knock in Ireland.  Brussels in Belgium.  Turin, Pisa, Trieste, Venice, Pescara in Italy.  And....Alghero.  However, I'm going home tonight to look in my guide book at all of these places so I'll send you another revised email tomorrow.

Get back to me when you can and let me know if you have any strong opinions one way or the other.  Obviously, I'm pretty flexible.

Sue

hey-was at liz's when you called.  she gets sex in the city on cable, and i
had to do it....anyways- just wanting to finalize some of my own travel
plans, so wanted to see if you were at all interested in going anywhere from
maybe june 7-9....go to www.ryanair.com and type in those dates leaving from
prob london stansted....about 6 pounds each way (approx $15 RT flights) to
plavces like venice, provence, frankfurt, etc...am totally free to going or
staying, but if there's something you particularly wnat to see or do NOT in
london, i can get the stuff together now while it's cheap.  plus- may be
jetting off myslef in next 3 weeks, and don't want to "duplicate" a
potential destination.  like i said- am totally indifferent- i LIVE on
holiday, so whatever you're up for, let me know asap... chat soon-
