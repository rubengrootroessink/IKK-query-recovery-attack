hey emily,

was just wondering what you're going to be up to this weekend...found a
pretty good deal to boston and was thinking about making a trip to
visit....totally last minute thing obviously.  if i did it, i'd get in
saturday evening and leave either monday or tuesday...drop me a line
when you get a chance.

susan
