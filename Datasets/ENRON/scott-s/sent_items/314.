Linda -- I used to have a link to the Enron Corp. Secretariat database -- has all the vital stats on all Enron entities.
Can you find out how to access it, as I seem to have lost the intranet site info I used to have.  It would really come in handy on this bid FERC filing I'm trying to get done.  Merci!
