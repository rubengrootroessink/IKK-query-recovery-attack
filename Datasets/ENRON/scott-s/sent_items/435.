here's the deal on the arm:

just got bk from france late mon night- had
lots of fun, race was ok, but looooong.  triped on harry potter's cape and
had to go in ambulance to emergency room to get x-rays on my arm at the
finish line.  quel surpris- sustain injury to my arm while running a
marathon.  

as for tomorrow...talked to Em this morning and she's on her way to NB to meet with the tile people.  said she'd be back either late tonight or early tomorrow morning.  as for tomorrow night, she's waiting to see about grandparents, etc. but may be able to meet if it's early....she's supposed to give me a call later so i'll let her know about the colina's thing

do you think em would want to do dinner with everyone? i can definitely make an excuse if not considering we dont know half the people going. if you speak to her let her know about the following and let me know what she would like to do.

hey lis-
i talked to ashley and we have a few people gathered for tomorrow night.  i
think we are meeting at colinas at 6pm.  i think it is maybe in rice
village??  i am going and ashley and susan and stephanie and maybe shelley
and i think 1 or 2 of their old college station friends.  let me know if
that sounds ok with you.  i think that is the name of the restaurant.  ash
picked a place that is less expensive b/c after all these weddings we are
all a bit broke!!  so- let me know- see you later-
laura
