Sue-Sue,
We loved seeing you this weekend.  I am catatonic today, but it was a fun
night.  Thank you so much for the gift bags and the wonderful rooster and
turtle.  I love the bags and the figurines are adorable.  The kids love
their watches.  I just had to strap Mack's on for bedtime!!  He told me that
it was 7 o'clock all day today.  Thanks again and we'll see you in Austin or
Houston soon! Love, Kathy
