I would definitely be up for tonight and a walk sounds great.  I just need to swing by the grocery store and the dry cleaners after work, so 6'ish is probably best for me.  Let me know if that works for you and also where you'd like to meet/walk.  Lisa, if there's a good place around your duplex I'd love to come see it and show you the pictures I took from your wedding...there's a great one of you and Brad dancing at the reception.  Anyway, drop me a line and we'll figure out when and where to meet.

Sue

Susie and Jen,

I am up for tonight if you can go after work.  We could go walking too?  I
am out on Wed because I am leaving for Fort Worth on Thursday for TJ's
wedding (one of Brad's friends).  I am not going to Deborah's wedding
(UNFORTUNATELY!!!).

Let me know.

Any chance either or both of you could get together this week for
coffee, dinner, ice cream, etc.?  Also, are you all going to Deborah's
wedding?

Talk to you soon,
Sue
