Do you think we could me for a few minutes this morning?  I've got a couple quick questions...I didn't feel like bugging you over the weekend.  Sometime before 10 am would be best for me because at 10:00 I'm supposed to attend a meeting regarding the analyst/associate program as it relates to UBS.

Thanks
