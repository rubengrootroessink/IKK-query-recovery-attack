so i'm back at home w/ the folks...i don't see this lasting too long.  mom woke me up this morning to see if i needed to get up and start getting ready...JEEZ....she said she'd heard my alarm going off.  you know how big i am on the snooze button.  anyway, i think we're going to have to have a chat tonight about "boundaries".  Ha.

in regards to enron, i still know nothing concrete.  hopefully by the end of the week we should now something w/ actual facts and figures.  

seattle was a really good trip...hoping to know more next week on that as well.  

talk to you soon,
Sue
