I'm sorry it's taken me so long to get back to you.  I would definitely enjoy the opportunity to answer any of your questions about the various opportunities within Enron.  I know what an overwhelming place this can be at times.  I'm actually heading out of the office today for a conference in Denver, but if you want to just email me some questions or pick a time that would be good for you to meet that would be great.

hi Susan,

My name is Aarati Siva, and I'm a summer analyst intern in EES (with the Load desk within Commodity Risk Management).  Priya Jaisinghani suggested I contact you when I mentioned to her that I'd like to talk to a couple of people  to find out more about Enron and its different businesses. 
 I don't know if Priya told you, but I met her when she came down to represent Enron at our school last semester (the University of Virginia).  I caught up with her a few weeks ago over lunch, which is when she suggested some analyst resources for me to speak with.  I'm a finance/economics major and hope to work here full time next year (if I get an offer!)...but I still am not sure where I'd like to work within Enron.   I was wondering if you had the time to tell me a little bit about what you're doing, and how you're liking it so far?  She told me you traded gas, and I'm eager to find out about trading opportunities, in particular, so I thought it would be wise to talk to someone currently involved with that.  If its not possible that's not a problem, I understand its a busy time for everybody just about now.  But if you could that'd be great - it wouldn't have to be long, I just wanted to get a little direction and advice from people who've worked in different places.  Thanks!

Cheers,
Aarati
