oh ok....yeah..i agree...though i want to talk to mike bc i need to know how far he has pushed this through...or how far bobby and mm have.  i just need to explain to mike that i am planning a relocation that involves john and i...a decision together...and that portland is not the only option we are looking at.....just so there is not this expectation that if they offer..i accept.
