Hey Lisa....

I'm probably going to have to head out this evening.  I'll call you on your cell phone to let you know if I'll be able to make dinner or not.  Can't wait to see you guys.

Susan

Hi guys!

I have been incredibly disorganized about the rsvps for Caycie's party this
weekend - so if you have already sent it in, I am so sorry!

Please email me back and let me know if you will be there for the Friday
night dinner (8:00 - Wimberly) and if you want to get a manicure/peticure
on Saturday.

Thanks!

Love,
Lisa
