I know, I know....she booked the flight right after we all got off the phon=
e.  The final blow, her ticket was about $30 bucks less than mine (Continen=
tal is evil).  Oh and by the way, I think she may be on your flight back to=
 H-town on the 12th...maybe you can switch your seats to be next to each ot=
her!  Regardless, still think it's going to be fun and the economics defini=
tely improve with more people.  She does want to visit with some of the Enr=
on people so get ready for a cat fight over precious little niklaus.  I fig=
ure at least one of the days she's gonna want to see work people so we'll j=
ust get some market shopping in then (and don't forget we'll have to escape=
 to discuss my last escapade).  Anyway, like I said...still thinks it's goi=
ng to be a good trip.  Let me know what you think about the Italy trip afte=
r you have a chance to look...Lisa and I have both been to Salzburg, but I =
don't think either of are opposed to going back.  The town is adorable and =
there are scenic vistas, not to mention sausage and beer.

Ciao,
Sue

ok- we lose.  didn't know what to do- she was like a little terrier chewing
on my sock and would not let go.  she insisted on waking you up and MAKING
OUR PLANS!  yippee.  ok- am going to try to be upbeat.  haven't actually
traveled with lisa, maybe is not bad.  but will say this:  am NOT blowing m=
y
stock $ savings from last 7 yrs to be bullied into shitty vacation.  i gues=
s
she's staying w/ me- funny, she never asked.  assumed that it was ok to put
potentially 5 people into 300 sq. foot flat.  sorry- don't want to get
huffy, but was really looking forward to this, and you KNOW if the shoe was
on the other foot and she had another A&M friend coming to visit and then i
tried to descend, it would not be a warm welcome.  am imagining YOUR living
room, minus matt, ......in london.  ok, done.  will try to look up more
stuff on italy tomorrow, but honestly don't care- would just like to go
somewhere pretty and not big-city-like where there are not too many sight
seeing opportunities i will feel obligated to participate in.  maybe
dividing room rate by 3 will allow for a fancy-schmancy hotel
room....positive thoughts, positive thoughts...try to call/email later.
