Bonnie....How was the weekend??????  Very curious to see what you crazy girls did up there in Whistler.  

So, I wanted to let you know that Puget called me last Friday with another job opening.  I'm supposed to talk to the guy today regarding the position.  I certainly don't want to get my hopes up...but I'm kind of excited about this being something I could actually like.  

Hope all is well with you and I'll let you know how my phone call goes today.

Talk to you soon,
Susan

Btw...messengered with Matt yesterday, I guess things are back to "normal" - whatever that is.

hi there:
how are you doing? have you told the company anything yet? i am thinking you probably had to turn ole pattie down... was she devestated that you won't be her new BFF?

let me know how it went, and i hope things are going well on the whole "looking for a job" front. I know it can be so frustrating.

have you spoken with matt????  any more updates with that?

happy valentines (even though it is a dumb holiday)

Take care
bonnie
