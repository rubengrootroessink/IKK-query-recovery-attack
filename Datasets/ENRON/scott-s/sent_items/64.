We tried so hard to make things better for our kids
that we made them worse.
For my grandchildren, I'd like better. I'd really like
for them to know about hand me down clothes and
homemade ice cream and leftover meatloaf sandwiches. I
really would. I hope you learn humility by being
humiliated, and that you learn honesty by being
cheated. I hope you learn to make your own bed and mow
the lawn and wash the car. And I really hope nobody
gives you a brand new car when you are sixteen. It
will be good if at least one time you can see puppies
born and your old dog put to sleep. I hope you get a
black eye fighting for something you believe in, I
hope you have to share a bedroom with your younger
brother. And it's all right if you have to draw a line
down the middle of the room, but when he wants to
crawl under the covers with you because he's scared, I
hope you let him. When you want to see a movie and
your little brother wants to tag along, I hope you'll
let him. I hope you have to walk uphill to school with
your friends and that you live in a town where you can
do it safely. On rainy days when you have to catch a
ride, I hope you don't ask your driver to drop you two
blocks away so you won't be seen riding with someone
as uncool as your Mom. If you want a slingshot, I hope
your Dad teaches you how to make one instead of buying
one. I hope you learn to dig in the dirt and read
books. When you learn to use computers, I hope you
also learn to add and subtract in your head. I hope
you get teased by your friends when you have your
first crush on a girl, and when you talk back to your
mother that you learn what ivory soap tastes like.
May you skin your knee climbing a mountain, burn you
hand on a stove and stick your tongue on a frozen
flagpole. I don't care if you try a beer once, but I
hope you don't like it. And if a friend offers you
dope or a joint, I hope you realize he is not your
friend. I sure hope you make time to sit on a porch
with your Grandpa and go fishing with your Uncle. May
you feel sorrow at a funeral and joy during the
holidays. I hope your mother punishes you when you
throw a baseball through you neighbor's window and
that she hugs you and kisses you at Christmas time
when you give her a plaster mold of your hand. These
things I wish for you through tough times and
disappointment, hard work and happiness. To me, its
the only way to appreciate life. Send this to all of
your friends who mean the most to you. We secure our
friends not by accepting favors but by doing them.
