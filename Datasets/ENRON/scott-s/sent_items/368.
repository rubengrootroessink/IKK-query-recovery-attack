It all sounds pretty good, but is there any way to get on an earlier flight Sunday?  Probably not, I know there are only a few flights out a day, but if I could get into Houston closer to late afternoon on Sunday it would be a better for me.  I'd really like to stay that Saturday night...so if worse comes to worse, I'll just deal with the jet lag.

Susan, 
If you leave on Tuesday the 14th, you will arrive on the 15th here.  That part is fine.  However, if you leave on the following Sunday, you'll be back into Houston Sunday.  Here is the tenative itenerary: 
Looks like Continental leaving Tues Aug 14 going from Intercontinental to LAX 0940-1105. 
Korean Air from LA to Korea at 1230.  You would arrive on Wed evening (the 15th) at 5:05pm. 
Leaving Sunday would put you on a flight leaving Korea at 5:30 pm on the 26th and arriving to LA at 
1:00 in the afternoon and leaving again on Continental at 3:30 and arriving in Houston at 9:00pm 
Sunday night. 
Let me know how that sounds.

couch to the pool to the couch and back to bed. Pitiful but much needed.
Anyway, I was just going to tell you to go ahead and buy the ticket for me.
Departing the 14th and returning the 26th...which I believe puts me into
Seoul Wednesday night and departing on a Sunday. You can either call or
email if you have any questions for me. And, I'll decide where I'd like to
go for the long weekend. I may pick two and just let you two decide the
final destination.
