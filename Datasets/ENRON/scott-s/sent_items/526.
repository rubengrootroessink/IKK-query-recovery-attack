Well, this morning was a little anticlimatic.  We did not get started till
935 bc she her house had flooded this morning and had to make some phone
calls to get things under control.  I was able at least to get the ball
rolling...however I did not get into my huge screwup.  I just started with
what I am feeling now..and why I am here in Utah...a little family
stuff...but no relationship/personal stuff.  She of course asked about
medication and I said I did not want to go that route unless I became so
blah that I couldn't leave the house or go to work...told her..I wasn't
there.  So I told her about my change in diet, no caffeine, no alcohol.  She
thought those were great things.  She advised me to attack this cold...ie:
get rid of it soon..and immediately resume exercise....aerobic exercise in
particular.  She said that it is aerobic, not the anaerobic (weights,yoga)
that are most effective for the funk.  So I bought some echinacea extract
and some echinacicia/zinc lozenges and today i'm gonna continue rest (will
nap this afternoon)...and I should hopefully be good to get a nice snowshoe
hike in the morning before I work tomorrow.

So thats it.  We have an apt on next tues.  I hope to get into everything
else at that point...there was so little time today.  She said DV pays for 8
appointments...so that made me happy.  I think 8 should make a good dent in
things and if I have to fork out a little cash after that point..it should
be worth it.

I'll be back at the cafe at 4 to work.  I'll check email later.  Hope you
are doing well.

Hasta
