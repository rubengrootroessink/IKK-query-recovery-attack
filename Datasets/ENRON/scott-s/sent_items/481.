FYI...  This is an e-mail from an Ensign stationed aboard the USS Winston
Churchill...

Dear Dad,

Well, we are still out at sea, with little direction as to what our next
priority is.  The remainder of our port visits, which were to be centered on
max liberty and goodwill to the United Kingdom, has all but been cancelled.
We have spent every day since the attacks going back and forth within
imaginary boxes drawn in the ocean, standing high-security watches, and
trying to make the best of our time. It hasn't been that fun I must confess,
and to be even more honest, a lot of people are frustrated at the fact that
they either can't be home, or we don't have more direction right now. We
have seen the articles and the photographs, and they are sickening. Being
isolated as we are, I don't think we appreciate the full scope of what is
happening back home, but we are definitely feeling the effects.

About two hours ago the junior officers were called to the bridge to conduct
Ship handling drills. We were about to do a man overboard when we got a call
from the LUTJENS(D185), a German warship that was moored ahead of us on the
pier in Plymouth, England. While in port, the WINSTON S CHURCHILL and the
LUTJENS got together for a sports day/cookout on our fantail, and we made
some pretty good friends.

Now at sea they called over on bridge-to-bridge, requesting to pass us close
up on our port side, to say goodbye.  We prepared to render them honors on
the bridge wing, and the Captain told the crew to come topside to wish them
farewell.  As they were making their approach, our Conning Officer announced
through her binoculars that they were flying an American flag.  As they came
even closer, we saw that it was flying at half-mast. The bridge wing was
crowded with people as the Boatswain's Mate blew two whistles- Attention to
Port- the ship came up alongside and we saw that the entire crew of the
German ship were manning the rails, in their dress blues.  They had made up
a sign that was displayed on the side that read "We Stand By You".

Needless to say there was not a dry eye on the bridge as they stayed
alongside us for a few minutes and we cut our salutes.  It was probably the
most powerful thing I have seen in my entire life and more than a few of us
fought to retain our composure.  It was a beautiful day outside today. We
are no longer at liberty to divulge over unsecured e-mail our location, but
we could not have asked for a finer day at sea.  The German Navy did an
incredible thing for this crew, and it has truly been the highest point in
the days since the attacks.  It's amazing to think that only a half-century
ago things were quite different, and to see the unity that is being
demonstrated throughout Europe and the world makes us all feel proud to be
out here doing our job.  After the ship pulled away and we prepared to begin
our man overboard drills the Officer of the Deck turned to me and said, "I'm
staying Navy."

I'll write you when I know more about when I'll be home, but for now, this
is probably the best news that I could send you.
