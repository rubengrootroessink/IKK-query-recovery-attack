Subject:=09RE: a little something to think about

I am genuinely flattered that you are asking for my reading recommendations=
 (not to mention being associated in any way, shape or form with Sam - How =
is Sam by the way?)  Truth be told, however, of late much of my reading mat=
erial has been natural gas related and although the industry is riveting, I=
'm not sure that is exactly the kind of entertainment you had in mind.  How=
ever, I did read a book a few months ago that you might find rather interes=
ting.  The title is The Professor and the Madman : A Tale of Murder, Insani=
ty, and the Making of the Oxford English Dictionary.  I know it may sound a=
 little dry at first glance, but I actually found it extremely interesting.=
  If you go to Amazon.com there are reviews on all of the books I've includ=
ed here.  There are also a couple of other books I'm in the process of read=
ing right now:  Galileo's Daughter : A Historical Memoir of Science, Faith,=
 and Love and Eleanor of Aquitaine : A Life.  The Galileo book is a little =
slow to start, but has tons of interesting historical references, as does E=
leanor of Aquitaine.  If I remember correctly, you always had a bit of a fo=
ndness for history.  I also read Memoirs of a Geisha last fall and couldn't=
 put it down, although I have talked to others who didn't find it as enjoya=
ble.  Personally, I was completely intrigued by the time period and uniquen=
ess of Eastern culture, and the author was meticulous when it came to resea=
rch for the book.
Hope this helps you out a bit.  As for the "Peacers" comment...Definitely t=
hink we are tested, but I think the tests are there to force us to recogniz=
e our own strength and endurance.  Contrary to God not knowing anything abo=
ut us, I'm convinced he knows everything about us and has the unique abilit=
y to know when we've lost sight of our talents, character and/or zest for l=
ife.  It is at these moments life seems to hand us the upsets right?  But, =
in dealing with the upsets we come to a better understanding of who we are =
and what we have to offer the world (or on a much smaller scale, what we ha=
ve to offer the people around us for whom we care the most).  Sorry, I know=
 I'm getting excessively deep, but I've been doing a heck of a lot of think=
ing lately - and much of it at church.=20
Disappointed you won't be able to join the gang in Austin over the fourth, =
but we'll be sure to raise our glasses in a toast to you.  And, I'll keep l=
ooking for you name on the Enron Field scoreboard.
Later,
Susan

Sue-

In lieu of my attendance in Austin, I want to know if you have any good boo=
ks for me to read.  I'm gotten a list from Sam and from a friend at school,=
 but I thought that you'd have some solid contributions.

A theory (for the Prince of Peacers):
=20
I debating the concept that we are a gigantic sociological experiment to Go=
d.  I'm thinking that individually God knows nothing about us, or cares for=
 that matter.  I feel that when he gets tired of watching Jerry Springer re=
-runs, he looks down on our little planet form his lay-z-boy and selects on=
e of us at random, throws a dose of adversity at us and watches how we hand=
le it.  Gotta be more entertaining than watching fat half naked people air =
their dirty laundry on T.V.  Then again maybe not.

I hope all is well.  Glad you like the new job.
