Hey,

I may swing by the Tasters dinner just to say, "Hi" to everyone and then meet you at the Forest Club.  What do you think of that?  Also, Katy and I may go to Blanco's later if you and Leslie have any interest.

So I've decided I will have to crash some of your happy hours and try to meet some decent boys.  I'm sick of these crappy ones.

Sue

I was just about to send you an email.  I can't get ahold of leslie-- forgot her cell phone number.  I left her a message at home and she normally gets in relatively early.  
My dad made a reservation for all of us for 8:00 at the Forest Club, but I totally understand if you want to go to the Tasters thing.  I have a feeling Leslie will come with us, so I think I am going to to go with my parents.
Let me know what you think.
