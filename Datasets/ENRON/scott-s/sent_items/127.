Sorry I never got back to you last night...I ended up going to grab dinner.  I'm still up for this evening if you are.  The "show" starts at 8:00 and I think it's about a $10.00 cover.  Either shoot me an email or I'll give you a call a little later this afternoon.  I don't think I have you work number anymore though, so if you wouldn't mind giving that to me again that would be great.

See ya later,
Susan

So... tomorrow night?  You, me Mucky Duck???  Whatever is good... we can go
for a little while or whatever.  Do you know how much it costs? I am
flexible... live music with a drink or two and good conversation sounds
pretty darn good...

Let me know and I will talk to you soon... AND if this doesn't work out for
some reason... no worries and we will re-schedule soon!

:o)  Jen
