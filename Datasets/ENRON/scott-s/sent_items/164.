Lupe,

I found a couple of checks that were for expense reimbursements.  They are past the 90 day period.  What can I do to have these checks reissued?  

Thanks,
Susan Scott

Anitha,

Susan has found a couple of checks that were for expense reimbursements.  They are past the 90 day period.  What can she do to have these checks reissued?  Who handles the expense checks, is that you?
