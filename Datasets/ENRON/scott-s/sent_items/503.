i know some of y'all already have plans, but for the rest of you- is anyone
planning anything fabulous for new year's?  or even not fabulous?
apparently bill will be with his wife, but would actually much prefer to be
with you people anyways.  alan mentioned NB a while back, which could be an
option if there's enough interest.  just hoping will not have to be watching
billy grahm on the christian channel countdown with my grandmother this
year, so would love some feedback....
