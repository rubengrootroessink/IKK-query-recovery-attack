I'm sure it is...I'll just keep forwarding the emails to you as I get them.  However, I will warn you that I'm on vacation from the 14th-26th of August.  I'm going to visit my brother and his wife in S. Korea so it should be interesting.  Anyway, you may want to give a heads up to people to make sure they're sending the information to the right person.

Thanks Susan.  I'm in the middle of my official Enron name change, so you might get a few e-mails for me in the next few weeks.
Never change your name at this company; it is the biggest nightmare!

Per our conversation, I have put the following information together for you to distribute to individuals in EPMI.  This details out verious aspects of the Texas retail market.  I have included in Item 3 below a copy of a Texas market analysis I prepared for EES which provides detailed implementation requirements.  The following are high-level items that I see need to be completed for EPMI to enter the Texas Retail market by January 1, 2002.  
	1)  Complete ERCOT LSE application
	2)  Review market requirements
	3)  Compare market requirements (enrollments, billing, payments, etc.) with current 	system capabilities for gaps
	4)  Develop EDI maps based on Version 1.4
	5)  Register for and complete Flight 1001 Testing
	6)  Execute applicable TDSP agreements (copies attached)
		Delivery Service Agreement
		Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) Authorization
		Electronic Data Exchange Trading Partner Agreement
