Hi Pete,

Would you mind shooting me back an email to let me know if I have the right address.  Brad McKay had actually given me your new work number, but unfortunately you were off the desk when I tried to call a few minutes ago.  Not too long after you departed, I too ultimately chose to decline joining UBS and am currently in the midst of researching new opportunities, interviewing, etc.  On that front, I was hoping to pick your brain a bit about a few things.  

Thanks,
Susan
