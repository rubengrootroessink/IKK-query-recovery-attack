hey emily,

was just wondering what you're going to be up to this weekend...found a pretty good deal to boston and was thinking about making a trip to visit....totally last minute thing obviously.  if i did it, i'd get in saturday evening and leave either monday or tuesday...drop me a line when you get a chance.
