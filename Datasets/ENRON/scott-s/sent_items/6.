No LW's for me tonight either...have dinner plans with a friend and ditto tomorrow night.  Friday may a happy hour option though.

This is seriously stooping for me but my car's in the shop and I can't track down my roommate or anyone else that lives in close proximity to me... so, (now here's the stooping part) do you know what time your neighbor is heading home?
