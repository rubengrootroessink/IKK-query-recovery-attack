George,

You'll be taking the May'01 Options out of the file today (Monday) and adjusting the P&L to reflect the May option value.  Stop by if you have any questions.

Hi, Susan:

How are you doing?

I forget when I should take all the May'01 Options out of The Exotic Pipe Options file.  Today or Monday(04/30)?

Thanks a lot.  Have a great weekend!
