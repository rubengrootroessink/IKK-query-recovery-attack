Hey Bonnie,

Ok, first the bad news...I can't come up President's weekend for the Whistler trip.  Now the good news, I'm going to be in Seattle next weekend.  I'm coming to have a 2nd round interview with Cascade Natural Gas (whose headquarters is actually right around downtown - looks like maybe Belltown).  Anyway, I fly in Thursday and don't leave until Monday.  The interview will be Friday, much like my set-up last time.  So, if you're going to be in town we definitely have to get together.  I think I'm really going to look for housing on this trip.  Maybe that will be the goal for Saturday.

Talk to you soon,
Susan
