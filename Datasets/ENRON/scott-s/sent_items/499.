once, a long time ago, i think you copied some words of wisdom for me from =
the Importance of Living...if it wasn't you it's not important, because the=
 point is that i recently found them again and reread them today.  i think =
you should read them too, if not for the first time, then again and with fr=
esh eyes....

"the ancient people who desired to have a clear moral harmony in the world =
would first order their national life; those who desired to order their nat=
ional life would first regulate their home life; those who desired to regul=
ate their home life would first cultivate their personal lives; those who d=
esired to cultivate their personal lives would first set their hearts right=
; those who desired to set their hearts right, would first make their wills=
 sincere; those who desired to make their wills sincere would first arrive =
at understanding; understanding comes from the exploration of knowledge of =
things.  when the knowledge of things in gained, then understanding is reac=
hed; when understanding is reached, then the will is sincere; when the will=
 is sincere, then the heart is set right; when the heart is set right, then=
 the personal life is cultivated; when the personal life is cultivated, the=
n the home life is regulated; when the home life is regulated the national =
life is orderly; and when the national life is orderly, then the world is a=
t peace.  from the emperor down to the common man, the cultivation of the p=
ersonal life is the foundation for all.  it is impossible that when the fou=
ndation is disorderly, the superstructure can be orderly.  there has never =
been a tree whose trunk is slender and whose top branches are heavy and str=
ong.  there is a cause and a sequence in things, and a beginning and end in=
 human affairs.  to know the order of precedence is to have the beginning o=
f wisdom."

right now i think both of us are at the beginning, i.e. "exploration of kno=
wledge of things"...and i think the "things" in this instance refer to thos=
e "things" in the past year which have dumb-founded us each individually.  =
i know you want to get to those heavy and strong top branches (and i think =
to a large extent children and caring for your partner in old age represent=
 those branches for you), but they will not come without the trunk...you ca=
n't jump the sequence of things.  now is the time for exploration, and i be=
lieve you are well on your way in that regard, but above all you must remem=
ber that time is the key...and that you can't rush yourself in this process=
.

hope the skiing is great and i will talk to you soon.
