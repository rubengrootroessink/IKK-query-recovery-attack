chrysalis (KRIS-uh-lis) noun, plural chrysalises or chrysalides (kri-SAL-i-deez)

   A pupa of a moth or butterfly, enclosed in a cocoon.

[From Latin chrysallis, from Greek.]

   "The climax of metamorphosis into an adult can be viewed almost daily.
   Butterflies usually emerge from their chrysalises sometime between 9:30
   a.m. and 11:30 a.m."
