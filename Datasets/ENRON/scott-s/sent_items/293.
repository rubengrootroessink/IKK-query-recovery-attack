Hey Matt,

Just thought I'd let you know that I'm thinking about heading to New Braunfels tonight to see Emily.  We were wondering if you might want to get together tonight...we've missed you terribly.  You can shoot me and email back or just call Emily at the river house (830 -964-2494) or me on my cell phone after 4:00 (713-775-6472).

Sue
