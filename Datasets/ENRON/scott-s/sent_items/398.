You've got the wrong Susan Scott...you may want to try her married name (which I, unfortunately, don't know).

JD,

To follow up on our earlier meeting, attached are the following documents for CG&E:

	- TSA network handbook which summarizes all requirements
	- Request for Network Transmission Service (Network Application)
	- Request to designate a New Network Resource (only required when we are ready to designate a resource)
	- OATT Tariff Attachments that includes Attachment F, Network Service Agreement and Attachment G, Network Operating Agreement
	- CG&E TSA, Transmission Scheduling Agent Agreement

If EPMI does not already have the Network Transmission Agreements in place, then CG&E indicated that the process was to first fill out the Network Application and then they will send the Network Service Agreement and the Network Operating Agreement.  

My contacts at CG&E have been Paul Jett  (513) 287-1770 and Steve Averbeck (513) 287-2876.  The government affairs contact is Gloria Ogenyi x 58202.  

Thanks, 
Jeff
