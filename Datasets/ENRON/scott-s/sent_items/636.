Hi Wei, 

The PWC guys said that 1:30 would be fine.  I have also asked them to email Chris and Bjorn with their requests.  If it is alright with you, we will plan to meet at your desk at 1:30.  What is your location again?

Thanks,
Susan

Susan,

I am busy this morning.  Can we do this early this afternoon, say at 1:30?

Also can you please send an email to my supervisor Chris Constantine and our main business user Bjorn Hagelmann to outline what the request is.

Thanks,

Wei
