Mine is sscott5_2000.  If you go to yahoo's home page you can try to instal=
l it yourself (eek!!!) or use the search on your computer (go to Start..Sea=
rch...For Files or Folders) and type in Yahoo Messenger.  If you still have=
 it on your computer it will show up in the search area and you can just do=
uble click on it...that should bring it up.

I'm doing alright.  And you hit the nail on the head with the Josh comment.=
...that's exactly what I've been reminded of.  That feeling of uncertainty.=
..loss of youthful bravado, sadness, injured sense of security...all of it.=
  Everyone in the Scott household is fine.  Dad actually flew over NY yeste=
rday morning before the first plane hit.  He was coming from Manchester, NH=
.  He said is was an absolutely beautiful day and that they flew right over=
 Central Park...no idea how dramatically that skyline would change.  The fi=
rst they heard of the events that they must have just missed was when they =
landed in Nashville.  He's still in Nashville right now obviously, but he's=
 okay and that's what's important.  I'm hoping with the limited flights the=
y're allowing that Dad will be able to make it back to Houston soon, but it=
 appears the FAA's just trying to get the passengers who are stranded back =
home so he may just be stuck somewhere else as a result.  Chuck and Chris w=
ere supposed to fly out tomorrow morning from Seoul but they too have been =
delayed - indefinitely.  The Army has put a hold on all duty station transf=
ers which means we have no idea when they'll be leaving Korea or where exac=
tly Chuck will be going.  The stories and connections of the people on the =
news and those around me is horrifying and deeply saddening.  A large numbe=
r of people we do business with are based in NY and have lost countless fri=
ends and colleagues in the WTC's destruction.  Chuck has some pledge brothe=
r's who are working up there, but we've heard that both of them are okay.=
=20

I wish you were back home as well....I was on the phone with my Mom off and=
 on all day yesterday and I must say it would've been nice to been back hom=
e on the couch with her.  I did talk to Jen yesterday worried about LA and =
what was going on there, but she was fine as well.  She said they'd shut do=
wn the airport and several major roads surrounding it, but nothing else of =
concern.

We evacuated the Enron building around 9:30 yesterday morning...it was disc=
oncerting.  I walked down the 32 flights of stairs to get to my parking gar=
age and had only one desire...to get out of downtown.  There were rumors fl=
ying that Houston was another target and given the size of our building, ou=
r international presence (esp. in regards to oil/natural gas) and our CEO's=
 connections to the President...I think everyone figured Enron would be a l=
ogical target.  Fortunately, those fears were unfounded.

On a lighter note...I'm very anxious to hear all about your marathon experi=
ence...including the trip there.  Sounds like it was a doozey.

Love ya,
Sue

where are you?  it's been ages since i heard from you- are you ok?  you kno=
w
it makes me nervous when you go AWOL.....matt called this morning and he
sounds really bad.  is doing that oh-so-familiar over-analyzing and
internalizing that would make almost anyone suicidal considering the
situation.  just want to be home so badly.  feel so isolated here.  wish we
were all out on the walker's patio now chatting, and i was with mom and dad
and harls.  i think that's the only place where i'd feel safe and reassured
and as close to happy as i could be right now.  kind of like the way
everyone described josh's funeral.  horrifying, but as good a company to
rebound with as you could find probably.  has been such a long and draining
month emotionally and physically, and am just gutted. hope you're a bit mor=
e
buoyant rt now han i am.  am trying to get home asap, but mom and dad don't
want me to fly.  am not worried about it, and am going to try to get on
first flight possible anyways, so may see y'all soon....pls email and let m=
e
know you're still alive and in proportionally good spirits...
