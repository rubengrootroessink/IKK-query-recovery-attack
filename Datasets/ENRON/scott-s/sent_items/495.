hey bonnie!!!

how are you doing?  i just had dinner w/ lisa last night and some of the UT girls here in houston.  she's was so excited to hear that we hung out as much as we did last weekend.  I wanted to write and thank you again for being such a gracious host...i had the BEST time hanging out and fell in love with Seattle all over again.  it is truly a fantastic city.  hope all is well with you, and i'm continuing to explore the possibility of joining you and Holly in the Emerald City.

have a wonderful holiday season,
susan
