Ray/Susan --One of you (or both) should be on these weekly calls, unless the items are being covered by someone else in our group (in which case, alert them to the EPSA call.)  EPSA is very active in making filings at FERC, taking the same position as Enron in many filings.  Sometimes we like to have EPSA file, then Enron may not need to file.  In some cases, EPSA cannot file (for example, when the members cannot agree), then Enron would file if it is an important issue to us.

For this call, Ray, you may want to be on the call since EPSA is going to file re: Cal. order.

Susan--Sarah Novosel will probably be on the call for the NY issue and Tom Hoatson is attending the workshop on capacity.  Therefore, typically, you wouldn't  need to be on this call, but I think you should listen in to learn.  (I will get you on the EPSA distribution.)

Tom--you may want to listen in to the capacity workshop discussion.

Donna --Discussion of Alliance.
