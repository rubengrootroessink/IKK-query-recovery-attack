I think some relaxation time is definitely in order for you...so don't worry about tomorrow.  If you're in we can just try and buy tickets there, and if you're out I'll go to the bachelorette party...easy peasy.  Considering you start this whole ride over again on Monday, I would totally understand you wanting to bail out. Whatever you decide PLEASE do not worry about me...I am the epitome of flexible these days.

I'm still thinking about it.  I have had a bad week-- very stressful-- and last night I was mad at the dogs for barking so I banged on the window and put my hand right through it.  Surprisingly I was not cut very badly.  I think I need to relax a little.
I want to go, but I am just giving myself an out because I sort of feel like curling up in my bed with a tub of ice cream and a movie.  Actually, I felt that way more last night, but I gained perspective after putting hy hand through the window-- and after realizing that today is my last day here and everything will be finished for better or worse before I leave.
Count me in for now.  I will call you tonight.  Tell me your cell phone number again-- (775-6427?).  Doug just got one-- his number is 512-796-2320.
See you soon.
