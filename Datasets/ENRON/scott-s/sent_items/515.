I just realized that I hadn't emailed you yet...shame on me.

Em and I (yes, it was just the two of us in NB...oh the shame) tried to call you on New Year's Eve, but you had already checked out of your room and I assume were staying with Priyah (I know I butchered that) whose last name I do not know.  Anyway, I did talk to your Mom the day you arrived in Madras and knew you were there safe and sound w/ a new friend too boot!

Hope you're doing okay and starting to adjust to the new surroundings.  Email me when you get a chance and let me know all about your trip.

Good Luck and talk to you soon,
Sue
