Hey,

Good to hear from you.

Can't say I have too much scoop on Reliant.  Although, I do know a couple of people who work and have worked there and I'd be happy to put you into contact with them if you'd like.

I'd love to get together while you're in town.  Tomorrow night's probably best for me so either give me a call at work or on my cell phone when you get a chance.

Ciao,
Sue

Hello Susan,

I hope that you are doing well and looking forward to the weekend!  I am
actually going to be in town, so perhaps we can all get together one night.
What is your schedule?  It's been too long.  Black Swan....???

I have an interview tomorrow with Reliant Resources and wanted to know if
you knew anything about them...being in the trading industry yourself.  The
inside scoop would be great!

I'm flying out tonight, but can always be reached on my cell at (713)
385-3358.

Take care,
Mary Rebecca
