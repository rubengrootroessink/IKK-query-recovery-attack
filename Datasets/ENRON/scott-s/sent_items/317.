UUUGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I just talked to Leslie, and we decided to go to dinner together.  Then, as we were getting off the phone, she said, "Is it OK if Joe comes with us."  I felt like I was going to cry-- literally-- my voice cracked when I said, "Sure...."  She said she couldn't believe how great things were between them right now.  I might die!
Well there's the turbulence in my world-- how's yours?
