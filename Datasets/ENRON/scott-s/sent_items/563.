I recently had the following wine at Wahso in Park City, Utah - USA...
991211200 Zilliken 1999 Saarburger Rausch Sp?tlese 17 750ml 
I was wondering if you could tell me of a distributor or retailer from whom the wine might be purchased.  I currently reside in Houston, TX but will be making a trip to Seattle, WA in the next couple weeks.

Thank you,
Susan Scott
