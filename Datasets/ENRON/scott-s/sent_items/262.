My mom told me about Tootsie when we got home...I am so sorry.  I know how much those dogs mean to you...as do most Londoners based on the picture arsenal.  Anyway, I'm sure the funk will last for a while, but eventually you'll start to feel better.  Just take the long weekend to relax and recoup from the news (and doctor prodding)...we'll grab a margarita next week sometime.

Sue

hey- sorry i didn't get bk to you last night- got home fairly late, then was
hit by mom with "tootsie died over memorial day, and we didn't want to tell
you til we could do it in person" , so am in a pretty bad funk.  my little
baby.  i know it's just a dog, but just doesn't seem to matter.  having
harls around helps, but it's not the same.  am going to go see papa today,
then have my slough of appointments tomorrow, then off thurs night to NB, so
prob won't be out and about til i get back early next week- maybe spirits
will have brightened by then, we'll see.  will give you a call later-
e
