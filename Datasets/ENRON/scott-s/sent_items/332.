I know...I'm a peach.  Ha.  Anyway, dinner was really good.  We had spaghetti (which John cooked), garlic bread and some of the red wine I'd brought over.  And, we watched Crouching Tiger which I loved.  You were right, it is a very woman take charge film.

I forgot it was Ted's birthday on the 4th.  That was nice of you to send a card.  He isn't so bad after all...
I worked until midnight last night-- it actually wasn't so bad.  I also am feeling less stressed because my dinner for tonight was cancelled because the partner who was taking me (Mike Perrin-- do you know Hunter?  He was a Fiji our year...) got sick.  I was disappointed but relieved.
How was dinner with Monique and John?
