i'm a total dork....before my last trip to seattle i sent away for the visitor bureau's tourist packet...

anyway, i was looking through it this weekend and it turns out i actually have a coupon for the symphony.  nothing big, something like 10% off, but i'd just thought i'd let you know.

hope you had a great weekend and i'll talk to you soon,
Susan

btw...i also have coupons for the IMAX and some other attractions.
