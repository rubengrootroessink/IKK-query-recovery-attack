hey mojo...

sry about the missed call last night...had put my cell on silent mode for dinner and forgot to take it off.  hope you had a good night.  i really want to talk to you about the last week or so, sounds as if was an eventful one for both of us.  i'm really curious to hear how your appointment went today so drop me a line if you get a chance today and we can set up a firm time to have a rap session.

hasta,
SueBob
