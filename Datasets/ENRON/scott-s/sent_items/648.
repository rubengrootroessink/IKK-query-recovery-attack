Kevin,

Thank you again for taking the time to meet with me last week.  After speaking with everyone Thursday it became obvious to me that there are some real opportunities and room for growth with Cinergy right now.  It was also apparent that it is going to take a good deal of hard work and the ability to tackle many variant tasks to achieve those aims.  To that end, let me reiterate to you my willingness to take on a host of responsibilities to aid in that process.  As I expressed to you at lunch, my goal is to obtain the skills and tools that will make me a consistent and effective trader.  I left the offices Thursday with the impression that Cinergy, and those with whom I interviewed, could help me to accomplish those objectives.  Good luck with the many tasks ahead and I look forward to speaking with you in the future.

Thank you,
Susan
