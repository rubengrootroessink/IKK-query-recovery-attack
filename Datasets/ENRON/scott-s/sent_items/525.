ok....i'm back at the desk.  just reread your email and realized you're actually working at the cafe tonight...cool.  

as for the apt., the first really was bound to be more of a meet-and-greet, lay the groundwork situation so maybe it's just as well is was shorter.  next week you'll be able to actually start examining things w/ her a bit more rather than merely establishing a starting point.

i was reading a bunch of my "With God All Things are Possible" book last night and there was a passage that just totally hit home with me which referenced Jesus' reaction to a sinner who approached him.

"he neither condoned nor condemned the sin, he understood it".....it think this is such an important perspective to gain not only in reacting to those around you but almost more importantly to yourself. (bear in mind that this is primarily me talk'n to me, but i thought you might take something away from it as well)

like i said, i'm gonna stick around here for a while and then i will, of course, have the cell phone.  

good luck kick'n the cold.

SueBob

PS - if you need a non-drinking partner at the "annual party" i'm in....

Well, this morning was a little anticlimatic.  We did not get started till
935 bc she her house had flooded this morning and had to make some phone
calls to get things under control.  I was able at least to get the ball
rolling...however I did not get into my huge screwup.  I just started with
what I am feeling now..and why I am here in Utah...a little family
stuff...but no relationship/personal stuff.  She of course asked about
medication and I said I did not want to go that route unless I became so
blah that I couldn't leave the house or go to work...told her..I wasn't
there.  So I told her about my change in diet, no caffeine, no alcohol.  She
thought those were great things.  She advised me to attack this cold...ie:
get rid of it soon..and immediately resume exercise....aerobic exercise in
particular.  She said that it is aerobic, not the anaerobic (weights,yoga)
that are most effective for the funk.  So I bought some echinacea extract
and some echinacicia/zinc lozenges and today i'm gonna continue rest (will
nap this afternoon)...and I should hopefully be good to get a nice snowshoe
hike in the morning before I work tomorrow.

So thats it.  We have an apt on next tues.  I hope to get into everything
else at that point...there was so little time today.  She said DV pays for 8
appointments...so that made me happy.  I think 8 should make a good dent in
things and if I have to fork out a little cash after that point..it should
be worth it.

I'll be back at the cafe at 4 to work.  I'll check email later.  Hope you
are doing well.

Hasta
