Actually, I'm thrilled you want to drive.  I know I like to drive most of the time, but I'm not kidding about being exhausted and thus wanting to limit my exertion.  I think we should shoot for leaving by 8:00 so that if we're running a few minutes late it's no big deal (as long as we're on the road by 8:30 we should be fine).  I have no idea what I'm wearing yet either...oh well, necessity is the mother of invention, right?  

The trip was incredible.  My life has done an absolute about face.  Can't wait to tell you all about it.

Talk to you later, 
Susan

Yeah!!!  If you don't mind, I would love to drive... Matt is flying in and
I'm not sure if he'll need a car but I wanted to have mine available to him
if he did need it.... is that alright?

THANK YOU... BIG for making maps... that will be wonderful!

The luncheon is at 12:30 and how long does it take to get to S.A.?  Should
we leave by 8:00 or 8:30????  I don't even know what I'm wearing yet.....
ughhhh!

I can't wait to hear about your trip... how was it?

Talk to you soon friend!

Love,

Jen
