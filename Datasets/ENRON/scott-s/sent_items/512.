Hey Bonnie,

Wanted to wish you a Happy New Year, and let you know that I'm Seattle bound one more time.  I have an office visit on the 11th of January so I should be getting in on the 10th and staying through the 13th.  Hopefully you're going to be in town and able to do something during that time.  Let me know how your schedule is looking.  Can't wait to see you again.  Who knows, this could be the precursor to an actual move...eek!

See ya,
Susan
