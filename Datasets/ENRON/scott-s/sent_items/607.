hey...how's it going?

sorry i've haven't emailed in so long...things have been busy.  btw, matt did decide to take the job with UBS.

as for myself, i went back up to seattle last weekend for an interview with the other company i'd talked to up there.  they ended up offering the job so i'm in the process of deciding whether or not i want to take it...i have until the end of the month to make up my mind.  meanwhile, i'm checking out a bunch of other possibilities and seeing what turns up.  living at home has been interesting.  mom still insists on waking me up personally in the morning and harassing me at every turn.  still, the meals are great and it's kind of nice to be at home right now.

i'm flying to tennessee today to visit chuck and chris...i'm very excited to see their house and the area.  i'll be there through monday and then work on planning my next trip...ha.  also, some other exciting news - kathy and travis are pregnant with their third!!!  babies galore in the scott clan...that is, of course, except for me.

talk to you soon,
susan

the pictures you took were great...can't wait to see more.  take care.

Got a delivery failed message when i tried to send this to you the
first time. somehow it went to susan.m.sc@kis.ernet.in???

i am sorry to hear about purget, but it sounds like things may work
out for the best regardless. i am so excited for you and very
excited to visit you in seattle when i return. i must say that you did
a very bold thing turning down UBS without having  another job
lined up. but i agree with you, its definitely best to make a clean
break. are all the employees that agreed to stay with UBS going to
 relocate or stay in houston? did lenhart accept? how long did you
have to make your decision? are you still working at enron for the
moment? if so, how long can you stay on and still receive a
paycheck?  what does your mom think about seattle? i cant
believe you could be there by march. sorry for all the questions...
just excited to hear.

yvette and erik have accepted jobs at Huber and are staying in
houston, but signed the contract to sell there house before they
accepted the job. so they will be moving into an apartment.
anything else going on? keep me posted and send me your hotmail
 email address. i have it in my address book on hotmail but havent
been able to access the internet in a week. just want to be able to
find you if you leave enron soon.

talk to you soon, take a look at the pictures below on my first week
 in kodai.

lisa
