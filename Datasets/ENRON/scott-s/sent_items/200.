my god, she's like that nagging cough in november that you just can't seem
to shake! know we must be sensitive for obvious reasons, but haven't played
all our cards-yet, je pense.  i think it's best you mention the fact that
she may want to ASK me if she can come.....tell her that you, katy AND kelly
have done so already, and bethlehem is FULL rt now.  no room in the inn.
which means, seriously, she may need to research alternative places to stay.
  really don't want to be a bitch, but honestly, it's my vacation too, and
as i said- love hosting, but not when it becomes uncomfortable.  will be
glad to treat her like a princess if she can come another time and give me a
heads-up.  i'm really sorry, but honest to god, things are getting out of
hand.  may also want to mention the weekend plans to go to the eagles
concert, which will be an all day affair (told all the gang to come at noon
and we'd drink margs and go to the pub all day before the concert)- i know
if you don't get tickets, you'll be ok, but lis can't go to the BATHROOM
alone....aughhhhh!  ok- off to dinner.  just saw the mandolin movie.  bad
news bears.  not on my recommendation list.  chat later-
