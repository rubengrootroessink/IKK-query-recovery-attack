Sounds good...I failed to comment on your movie question.  No, I haven't seen any lately so that sounds good to me too.  I've been going crazy on the internet today looking for things/places to do/go.  Anyway, I was also remembering how wonderful getting that massage was last time I was there and wondered if you knew of a good spa close by your place that maybe we could both go to ( or I could go to while you're studying).  Just a thought.

no, i don't really.....do you have ideas??  we have a couple options:  there is an easter service in some flower fields that are just beautiful and have an ocean view- if it's nice, it might be a unique place to go for a service.  otherwise, there's always my parent's church, but that's rather far so i've already set them up for us not joining them.  there is another church in my area which a bunch of friends go to, but to which i've never been.....i'll send out the email and find out where everyone is going this weekend.....let me know if you've heard of good brunch places!

So do you have any ideas/plans for brunch on Sunday...my guess is there are
a ton of places with special Easter Brunches.  I just thought maybe you had
a regular spot.  Let me know.
