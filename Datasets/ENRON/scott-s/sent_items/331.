ract very fun and interesting people...it's a credit to your excellent comp=
any.  By the way, how are things in regards to Clint...still just good hang=
-out buddies?  I'm assuming, since you didn't say anything in your email th=
at things with Brendan are still good and if so, I'm glad for you. =20

I went shopping at Stein Mart recently too and found some really cute thing=
s, I absolutely love that store.  And, I'm honored to be your shopping muse=

It's been quite a while since we caught up on things.  How are you doing
these days?  Things here are pretty good.  I went about a month ago and
visited Emily in London and have been busy with work, etc.  Hope you had
a good Fourth of July!!!
