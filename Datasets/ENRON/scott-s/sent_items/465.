Thank you, Susan!  Will you send me your phone number?? I've been wanting to call you and have been out of town- just returned last night.  Really want to catch up with you!
Let me know when is a good time to reach you- tonight, maybe?
Will you also send me your mailing address?
Hope all is going well for you!
Love,
Julie
