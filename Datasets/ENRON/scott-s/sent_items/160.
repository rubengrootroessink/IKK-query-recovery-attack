Would love to get together again sometime, but I'll think I'll let someone else take over as far as the shot contests go...I was the champ - though ultimately of what I'm not sure.  Frightening as it is I felt fine on Saturday, however from what I've heard that wasn't exactly the case with Bass.

Thanks again,
Susan

(You'll probably be receiving words of gratitude from me for a while to come)

You are so funny...I will always be there for the winner of a shot contest.  You were the champ!!! Let's do it again sometime.

You're welcome,
Adriane

Adriane,

Thank you so much for helping me out Friday night.  Just one of those
things....you think you're doing great and the next thing you know you
feel like you've slammed into a brick wall at 100 mph.  I have now
barred myself from any sort of contest with Bass (they always turn ugly)
and have instituted a personal limit for myself.  Hopefully, I'll find
the maturity that was missing during our gathering at Teala's and will
be able to stick to the new limit.

Thanks again,
Susan
