hey holly,

just wanted to see what's going on with you, and to inquire how the long weekend in whistler went...i'm curious to hear how everything played out.  also, bonnie wanted to get the name of the guy you knew who's based down in tacoma and went to west point.

drop me a line when you get a chance.

Susan
