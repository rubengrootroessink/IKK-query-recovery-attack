thought you'd get a kick out of reading this...start from the bottom up.  (you'll have to click on the web link to see the e-card i sent ted for his b-day)  as monique comically pointed out this morning, "bet you never thought somebody would make ted look good?"  in the land of disappointing men, it's all a matter of degrees.

No problem...and you still need to see the Yankee Doodle Dandy movie, very patriotic and especially poignant for an independence day baby.  As for gas trading land, things are good.  Everyday I become a little more comfortable with the region I'm trading as well as the ins and outs of the pipeline and storage systems.  Sorry to hear about the ag group's demise, but I'm guessing there are some great opportunities to be had on the weather desk so congratulations are in order (as usual you have landed on your feet).  What's Darren going to be up to as a result of this?  

Anyway, glad you got in some vacation time before the move and as luck would have it over your birthday.  Did you make it back to Cali or head to your new second home, Austin?  I'm assuming the book you are referring to is Market Wizards...I haven't read it yet, but have heard much about it from some of the other traders on the desk.  Maybe I should give it a look, if only to see what kind of things I'll need to write about once I join that circle...attitude is key.

Thanks for note shorty.  I hope all is well in gas trading land.  I will be joining the weather derivatives desk asap as the ag effort has been shelved.  But, this afforded me the opportunity to take a vacation last week which was cool (again the charmed life of Ted Noble).  I would like to hear about your time as a trader and I have a good book for you to read about interviews with the world's top commodity traders.
