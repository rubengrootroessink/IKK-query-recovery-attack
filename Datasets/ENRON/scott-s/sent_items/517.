forgot to tell you....

talked to Jennifer Bagwell yesterday and...she and Christian got engaged on the 28th.  she's very excited and sounded genuinely happy.  just thought i'd fill you in some good news.  and, yes, i do think it's a good thing.

also, i'm sure tori sent you an email...but, yesterday was her last day w/ ENE.  i'm truly thrilled for her too.  i think this is going to be a very good thing.
