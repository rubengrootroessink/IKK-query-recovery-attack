so this was my quote of the day.....

Our chief want is someone who will inspire us to be what we know we could
be. -Ralph Waldo Emerson, writer and philosopher (1803-1882)


wow, huh?

anyway, got your email with the articles for wahso...going to read them rig=
ht now.  looks like i may be moving tomorrow, so i'll let you know what the=
 future holds for me when i have a better idea. =20

more importantly, i wanted to tell you how proud i am of you.  not only for=
 striking out to park city on your own, but also for making the impression =
you obviously have on the people with whom you work.  it's often hard to se=
e when you are the person in question, but i can tell you from my perspecti=
ve that the people you work & associate with think very highly of you.  and=
, i'm thrilled that windy ridge vocalized their appreciation of you and you=
r skills...definitely something you deserved to hear.  it is a great gift t=
o be a person others have confidence in and want to be around, and those ar=
e qualities that you possess without question. =20

driving into work this morning my sister called on the cell phone, said she=
 had a special message for me...then mack and sally got on the phone and th=
ey sang happy birthday to me...i'm such a sap i couldn't help but to start =
tearing-up.  after they hung up i took a moment to examine where i am in my=
 life right now, and i'm happy to report that i am pleased.  i tried to ima=
gine my emotions had i decided to stay on w/ the group and i don't think my=
 optimism would be nearly so great.  my point is this, sometimes not knowin=
g exactly what the future holds frees you to imagine and dream of things yo=
u normally wouldn't.  so to you i say, the sky is the limit....dream, imagi=
ne, explore.  we are both going to do great things in and with our lives.  =
but what i think we need to realize is the scale of those things may be sma=
ller (or even grander) than we'd imagined...point being,  we just need to t=
ry and be aware of those opportunities which come along every day that affo=
rd us those great moments be they large or small.

cheers!
