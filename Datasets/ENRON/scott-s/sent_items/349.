Subject:	Re: Hello

perfect timing!  AND- i did get an email from jim saying he prob couldn't go
out this weekend anyways, since the production time was so short- but maybe
a chance to tonight (wednesday) after the show.  depending on your plans, he
could make for a very interesting wild card in the situation.....very
wealthy, attractive, successful, mid-30's LA producer/writer w/ house on
hermosa beach.....not a guy I'D want to have to compete with- makes a
twenty-something energy trader from nw coast w/ school teacher finacee sem
pretty lame!  just a thought.....am knee deep in copyright articles rt now-
if you happen to come across any news relating to european patent law,
digital images,fine art and ethics, pass them my way!
