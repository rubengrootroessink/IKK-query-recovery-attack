I'm leaving shortly for the airport, but I will give you a call when I get back so we can discuss transport to SA.
I am way too excited about this trip (many pics will be taken).

Susan

I completely agree about foregoing the Mucky Duck Tuesday...too cold and too rainy for me.

Oh boy was that ever a thunderstorm last night.... it was GREAT!!!  Good
call on not heading out... we will re-schedule for sure :o).

I'm excited about your trip to the Caymans... lucky dog!

So... about our little venture to S.A.... when are you getting back from
your trip?  I am up for driving Friday morning.  If you want to go to Austin
Thursday night please feel free... that is fine... I just feel calmer when I
don't have to drive at rush hour.  Aaahhh!!!

Talk to you soon,

Jen
