Thanks anyway...I eventually tracked it down yesterday.  

And yes, the real world emphatically sucks.  Emily's got the right idea, avoid it at all costs.  Still, work's going all right for me.  My hours have dramatically improved, which is nice, and they actually let me take time off for vacation.  I'm reserving the weekend Emily mentioned in September so hopefully I'll see you there.

Susan

Hey Susan-
I don't have Emily's number.  I am 100% useless.  I just started school
today.  Wow!!  How's work going?  The real world sucks.  I would love to see
you in September in NB.
Brittany
