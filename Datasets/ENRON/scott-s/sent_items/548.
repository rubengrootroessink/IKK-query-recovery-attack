Hi John,

I've been trying to get a hold of Julie this morning, but am not certain if
she is in the office today.  My current situation has become somewhat
interesting over the last several days and I was hoping to be able to talk
over some things with her.  If Julie is in fact out of the office today
would you mind if we talked at some point.  I'm under some deadlines around
here and would be very grateful to have an opportunity to discuss things
with Julie or yourself.

Thank you,
Susan Scott
