Hey Holly,

Just wanted to let you know that I'll be back in Seattle this weekend (tonight - Sunday morn).  Not sure what you're up to, but if our schedules allow it'd be nice to see you again and hang out.  I'm staying at the Claremont downtown and will have my cell phone w/ me (713) 775-6472.

Talk to you soon,
Susan
