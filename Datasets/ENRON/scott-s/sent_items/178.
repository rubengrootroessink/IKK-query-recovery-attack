Em,

Glad you had such a good time...sounds like Norm may have even had a little bit of fun?  Anyway, must agree on the ex-fianc? front ( I am understandably nervous about said individual's return to Houston ).  Have to agree on the German beer/food front as well.  I loved everything about that country while I was there, especially the people.  They were all so jolly and round.

Talk to you soon,
Sue

Had another pledge sister's wedding this weekend, Deborah Vest, and it was beautiful of course.  Happened to run into Doug George, a.k.a Big Ken, and he said to say, "hello".  He's living in Austin these days and is planning on going to grad school in a year and a half or so (though hasn't applied yet).  He said he saw T.L. recently in Dallas and Taylor has gained about 40 lbs, gone off his rocker, and is dating a girl who used to have purple hair...all sufficiently disturbing news.  Anyway, maybe we'll be able to get in touch with Doug if we end up going to Austin while you're in town.

we're back....and have drank more beer and eaten more pretzels than any
human should.  have a new appreciation for beer- it may have been the
precious beergardens and fab weather, but am convinced that german beer is
in another stratosphere than coors light et. al......am not sure it can be
duplicated at home.  beautiful countryside- grt food and weather.  the
little cities were straight out of hansel and gretel and the sound of music.
  am still jet lag and confused, but will try to call tomorrow or next day.
think it may be time to totally nip the ex-finace in the bud, or you could
be in for a loooong summer....chat soon-
e
