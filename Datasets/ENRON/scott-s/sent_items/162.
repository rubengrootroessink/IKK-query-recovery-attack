you're not slow at all....you just have to figure out which region they're in and ask the appropriate trader which gas daily volatility they'd like to use.

Congrats on "the move"...O'Neal told me the good news.

How do you determine which Omicron curve to use for the curves that don't have one?

I know ... I'm slow.

If you pull the Curves up under Pub Names you should be able to tell if the have any Omicrons attached to them on the Erms side...if the do, then you have to talk to Nilay Basu to make sure they are mapped on the Germs side...if they don't, then you'll have to attach an omicron and then speak with Nilay.  I can swing by later if you'd like me to explain in a little more detail.

How do I find out the omicron curves for these curves?  Would George know?

Please see below and note that the following curves do not have any omicron vol curves.  Can you help map these?

Thanks,
Frank
