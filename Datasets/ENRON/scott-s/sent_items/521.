so obviously i decided against coming up this weekend...ha.  on the one hand i thought it be nice to hang out today and have a little distraction before your apt., but then i thought it might be better for you to have the day to reflect, prep, etc.  anyways, just wanted to see how you're doing and since you do have the day off i figured you'd be popping into the cafe at some point.

got an email from Lisa...so she is at the school and sounded ok.  it was a short mass email.  hope to getter a longer one at a later date.  

talk to you soon,
SueBob
