Either option sounds good to me.  Just send an email with the time and place when you guys figure it out and I'll be there.

Jen and I were consulting on the issue at hand and we
came up with a couple of ideas for where to
go...either Amazon Grill by the galleria or Fox Diner
on Shepherd?  Email me with your pick or any other
suggestions.  See y'all Thursday!
