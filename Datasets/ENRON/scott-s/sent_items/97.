Okay,  I'm in for driving together on Friday.  Although I'd love to see my sister and her family in Austin, I decided last night that I'm just too tuckered out to make this weekend any more exhausting than it's already going to be.  So...we just need to figure out what time we're leaving on Friday morning and who wants to drive.  I'm going to map out all of the directions for the weekend today so I cut down on my frustration level in regards to San Antonio.  Absolutely no more getting lost for Susan...zapps my energy.

Talk to you later,
Sue
