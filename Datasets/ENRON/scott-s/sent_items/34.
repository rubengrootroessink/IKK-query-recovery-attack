Subject:=09Entities that do not need FERC power marketing authorization

We have been getting questions about the ability of potential customers to =
sell power onto the grid to EPMI.  Below is a brief outline of the FERC lic=
enses required.  Customers other than those listed below (including non-QF =
industrial on site generators) need a power marketer license from FERC.  In=
 most cases, such customers do not need to file for EWG status (unless thei=
r primary business is as a utility, like Enron). =20

In addition, both EPMI and EES filed at FERC for authorization to perform c=
ertain power marketer license functions on behalf of industrial on-site gen=
eration customers.  We expect the authorization within a month.  I'll let y=
ou know when we receive it and what we can do for customers.

Christi-

This email briefly responds to your question whether state agencies or muni=
cipalities and qualifying facilities ("QFs") must obtain power marketing au=
thorization.  The answer is no.

With regard to state agencies or municipalities, section 201(f) of the Fede=
ral Power Act ("FPA") states that no provision of Part II of the FPA, which=
 governs the regulation of electric utility companies engaged in interstate=
 commerce, "shall apply to, or be deemed to include, the United States, a S=
tate or any political subdivision of a state, or any agency, authority, or =
instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing, or any corporation whi=
ch is wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by any one or more of the foreg=
oing, or any officer, agent, employee of any of the foregoing acting as suc=
h in the course of his official duty, unless such provision makes specific =
reference thereto."

Section 205 of the FPA, which would would otherwise require an entity to ha=
ve rates for wholesale sales of power on file with FERC, does not apply to =
state agencies and municipalities.

With regard to whether QFs need power marketing authorization, most QFs are=
 exempt (some small power production facilities are not exempt) from most p=
rovisions of the FPA, including section 205, which requires public utilitie=
s making sales of electric energy for resale in interstate commerce to file=
 rate schedules with FERC.  QFs are instead regulated under PURPA, which au=
thorizes utilities to purchase power from QFs at the purchaser's avoided co=
st.  FERC decisional precedent indicates that a QF can lawfully sell at mar=
ket-based rates without seeking market-based rate authorization from FERC, =
but that it may nevertheless be prudent for a QF to seek FERC acceptance of=
 a market-based rate schedule that would provide protection in the event QF=
 status is lost.

Let me know if you need anything else.
