Just got your email...I'll take a look at it after morning trading.  It does sound like it would be fun.

What happened to you last night?  I was starting to get worried about you.  Also, we have one of our Taster's dinners Thursday night and both Katy and I are planning on going.  Any interest?

Would you be interested in volunteering for the Boys & Girls Club camp on the weekend of July 13-15?  I think it sounds like fun.
