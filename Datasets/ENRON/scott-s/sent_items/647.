Shelly,

Thank you for taking care of all the travel arrangements and interviews.  I=
 look forward to meeting with yourself and the various other members of the=
 Aquila team tomorrow in Kansas City.  The web page links you sent were ver=
y informative and certainly gave me a better understanding of Aquila and it=
's company culture.  I also wanted to let you know that I did complete the =
on-line application you referenced in your last email.  If there is anythin=
g else you need from me, please don't hesitate to ask.

Thanks again,
Susan Scott
