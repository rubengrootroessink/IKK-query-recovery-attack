Yes it is true that my pool is much cooler than yours and Sunday sounds 
good.  I think I get in around 7:30 Sunday night but I will pass along the 
details when I pick up my e-ticket.  No need for a ride out there (you should 
enjoy your happy hour) but I will need one coming back on Sunday if that 
works with you.  I had fun last night as well and again you looked great and 
I had my usual good time just hanging out with you.  My place will be a 
disaster when we get back but what can you do.  Thanks for the ride in this 
morning and dropping off the movies. I'll talk to you later.  I hope your day 
is going well and that you DID catch some heat for coming in late.

I'll drive you to the airport tonight...IF I get to come over for a swim 
Sunday. (Believe me, my motives are purely selfish - your pool is so much 
"cooler" than mine.)

-- By the way, even with our slight car problem I had a great time last 
night.  You're really going to have to stop being so much fun to be around or 
you'll never be able to successfully ditch me (although last night was a 
valiant effort).
