puh-lease!   i know i just emailed you, but i had to respond.  sometimes
it's hard for me to email back in a timely manner since, w/o a laptop, i
only have computer mon-thurs.  sue, PROMISE me you WILL not sacrifice your
integrity and allow him to weasle in just b/c he has a guilty conscience.
i'm pretty sure you won't, but i'm just imagining as i sit here the stories
your mom and dad have to tell.....and that's just the tip of the iceberg!i'm
a firm believer in the one strike and you're out thoery, and of course,
based on a, his behavior in the last few weeks, b., the sage words of his
'trusty' friend kevin, who DID give your parents the time of day, c., his
behavior steak nite, and d., HIS BEHAVIOR!!!!- i'd say he's been benched.  i
wouldn't rule out an 'explanation beer', but i thinks it's time to lower the
blow, so to speak, cut your losses, and run like hell....
