AAAAAGGGHHHHHH...I just found out that I need to take the TX drivers exam 
both written and on the rode.  This is a two day process and all because I 
let my CA license expire.   I know I need some of your organizational 
skills.  I may try to run out and take the test this afternoon while I get 
moved to 30 (I better not fail it). How's life on 32 today -- well that's 
enough about you let's talk more about me.
