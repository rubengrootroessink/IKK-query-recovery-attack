So are you up for any friendly or unfriendly bets on this weeks big show
down?  I don't think the lines are out yet but I'm sure you guys will be
favored by at least a touchdown.  So I'll take the Aggies +7.  How about the
loser either picks up the first round or the whole night the next time we
hit the town, although the later might be pretty steep.  Don't know if your
a gambling gal but I thought I would at least present this opportunity to
you.

Anyway, how's the old option book?  Are you getting a handle on the whole
macro thing?  Look on the bright side it is only a three day week and I'm
sure you'll get the whole 40 in.

Take it easy.

Kyle
