We got to talking about you at lunch today.  Rudy mentioned that in effort to 
get your goat he often tells you your not being very altruistic towards him 
by consuming
so much of his time requesting reports.  My understanding is that your 
typical response to this is "I am the most altruistic person."  I am sure you 
recognize the hypocrisy 
laden in this statement.  If a true altruist is unselfish then he would not 
care if his acts are recognized or not.  In fact, the true altruist hopes 
only that his acts benefit
those to which they are directed.  We may have to downgrade you to "concerned 
individual".                       

But given your good-hearted and idealistic leanings I thought you would might 
like to know that the Landmark River Oaks Theatre is going to be showing Mr. 
Smith 
Goes to Washington Saturday and Sunday at 10:00 a.m.  If you haven't seen the 
film it's a black and white starring Jimmy Stewart as an idealistic, 
extremely unselfish
young man who takes on the corrupt political machines of Washington, D.C.  
The film ranked 29th on AFI's (The American Film Institute) top 100 films of 
the Century list,
and is tied for first place on the Sscott5 Greatest Films List..

FYI- Neither you nor Nick have been removed from the group email, I simply 
haven't sent one out in the past two weeks.  I will make sure you both 
receive my next 
brilliant composition.  I must say I was tempted to remove you given your 
complaints about receiving all of the follow-up commentary and a lack of 
appearances.
