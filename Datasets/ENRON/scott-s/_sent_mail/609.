Thanks for the advice/humor.  I'm feeling much better today.  I knew 
yesterday was going to be pretty rough and not much fun as his communication 
or lack thereof would speak volumes.  (And his silence definitely said a lot)

Everyone's pretty much on the same page as far as their disappointment in 
said individual goes.  I think we all expected a little bit more out of him.  
Oh well, so I'm single again.  Just think how incredible it'll be when I find 
someone I feel even more for than Ted (at least that's what I'm focusing 
on).  So do we know if Pat Fitzgerald is single?

Anyway, I've found I'm not that attracted to cowards (which is exactly the 
catagory I'd put Ted in right now).

Hope everything's good with you (especially the firm recruiting).  I'm coming 
up this weekend for the game - hopefully Friday night - and wanted to see if 
you and Doug wanted to go out either Friday night or after the game 
Saturday.  I hope you guys are planning on going to the game because I'd love 
to sit with you.

Talk to you soon,
Susan

PS - Check out the list of individuals for our girls night out the Thurs...I 
don't think I'm going to go (I don't have enough time to waste on people I'm 
not that fond of)
