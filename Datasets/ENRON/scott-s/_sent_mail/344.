Subject: Revised Contract Approval Request - Phillips Petroleum Company

TRANSWESTERN PIPELINE CONTRACT APPROVAL REQUEST

Phillips Petroleum Company's discount letter was recently approved by 
Transwestern's Officer group.   However, Phillips has now requested that 
Transwestern include language in the discount letter which guarantees the 
applicable discount rate in the event that Transwestern's minimum Tariff rate 
were to be higher than the discount rate.  I have underlined the additional 
language  in the attached revised discount letter (language will not be 
underlined when provided to Phillips).  The inclusion of this language would 
require Transwestern to file the discount as a negotiated rate prior to gas 
flow under the term of the amendment.  Transwestern would file this discount 
on January 31, 2001.

Please review the attached document and indicate approval via REPLY WITH 
HISTORY.
All Officer approvals will be sent to Bill Cordes for final President Level 
approval.
