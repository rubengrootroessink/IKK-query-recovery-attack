I re-compiled Exotica.xll, so that the xcol function is a put on collar.

De-add in your Exotica. Add this special one. And use xcol for put.

Then delete the Exotica_xcol_putoncollar.xll

We will build in this functionality in near future.

Paulo,

Can you add a flag to xcol function so that we can choose a put or call from 
the
spreadsheet ?

Thanks.

Zimin
