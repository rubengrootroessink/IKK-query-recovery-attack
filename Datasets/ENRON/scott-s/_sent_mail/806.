nt
                  or perfume of the gods=20
                  *2 : something extremely pleasing to taste or smell=20

                  Example sentence:
                  "We feasted that evening as on nectar and ambrosia; and n=
ot
                  the least delight of the entertainment was the smile of
                  gratification with which our hostess regarded us, as we=
=20
satisfied
                  our famished appetites on the delicate fare she liberally
                  supplied." (Charlotte Bronte, Jane Eyre)=20

                  Did you know?
                  "Ambrosia" literally means "immortality" in Greek; it is =
a
                  derivative of the Greek word "ambrotos," meaning "immorta=
l,"
                  which combines the prefix "a-" (meaning "not") with=20
"-mbrotos"
                  (meaning "mortal"). In Greek and Roman mythology, only
                  immortals -- gods and goddesses -- could eat ambrosia. Th=
ose
                  mythological gods and goddesses also drank "nectar," whic=
h,=20
in
                  its original sense, refers to the "drink of the gods."=20
(Even today,
                  you'll often find the words "ambrosia" and "nectar" in ea=
ch
                  other's company.) While the "ambrosia" of the gods preven=
ted
                  death, we mere mortals use "ambrosia" in reference to thi=
ngs
                  that just taste or smell especially delicious.
