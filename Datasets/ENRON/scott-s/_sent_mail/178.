Hi Mum.  Sept. 29 sounds great; I have always wanted to see Chorus Line.  So 
go ahead and order tickets if you like.  

I think I might be skiing in the Park City area in December.  Allie's wedding 
is Dec. 16.  at Sundance.  If you and Eric planned your trip then, you and I 
could hit the bunny slopes together.  I want to take lessons, and stick to 
the easy runs.  No way am I getting more injuries; I am creaky enough as it 
is.

Bill is still hoping to go to Sweden in September to buy his Volvo wagon.  I 
have really lost my enthusiasm for the trip and would rather go to Mexico, 
and have told him so.  So I'm not sure what will happen.  Are you interested 
in going to San Miguel for the running of the bulls?

Hope the Hip Abductors are not demanding too much as ransom.

Love,
Sooz

Hi, Sooz!  What are you doing Sat, Sept 29?  Was just checking over the
Broadway series at the Paramount, and "Chorus Line" is coming for a 2-wk
period.  I would love to see it.  I could probably find someone to go with on
a weeknight, but would prefer going with you if you're available.  Let me
know.  I'll be leaving for Calif a few days later, Oct 3.

Eric had a fatty tumor removed from just under his shoulder Mon.  Called him
when I returned from Houston to check on him and he surprised and shocked me
by saying he was not skiing with his L.A. group this year, and wants me to go
on some ski trips with him.  It's one of those things you wish for, and then
you get it?  Oh no.  I don't even know if I'll really progress past the
beginner slope, but am sure I'll be very good at apres.  I think he's
considering Park City for the first one.  He says the transportation there is
good, and it's a good place for me to learn.

Darrell went with me to The Hills Tues. and I discovered the Hip Abductors!
Wow.  Didn't feel the workout until after my walk last night.  Sure hope all
this is doing some good.  Checked their long list of reciprocal clubs, and
The Met isn't one of them, but that doesn't matter.  You can still go as a
guest.  (Neither is the Los Gatos Ath. Club.)  Must check out exercises for
skiing.

Went to the lab early this a.m. for pre-physical tests.  Had a late lunch
yesterday and no dinner, so I was starved when I woke up.  They opened at
7:00 and there wasn't much of a wait.

Fabion had disappeared for a few weeks, and Mike had lined up another guy to
mow for us, but Fabion showed up--he had been in Mexico.  Sure glad to see
him.  He's from some town near San Miguel.

K, J & G are coming for an overnight Sat.  Karin has a haircut appt.  Glad
for the company.

Mother's a/c went out in her car as she was leaving Austin on the 5th.  All
that way to Houston in the heat.  At least she left early.  She just spent
$800 for a new compressor for that old heap.  Couldn't believe it.  She had
just spent $200 for freon on her previous trip--it all leaked out.  Even with
her other gas guzzler, $1000 would have gone a long way paying for gas.

Hope you're having a good week.  Did Bill make it home?  love, mum
