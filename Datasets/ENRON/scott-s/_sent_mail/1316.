I bolt out of here pretty early these days if I can...best to reach me by cell phone if it's past 4 pm Houston time (713-775-6472).  Did I tell you I'm off to Vegas this weekend?  I love this job.

your desk.  what up?  try to call me later tonight- have "appointment" with
jen at 9 pm my time, so preferably before 9 or after 10 pm....peace out.
