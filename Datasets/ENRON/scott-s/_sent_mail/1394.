I have to be in S.A. on the 6th for Lisa's bridesmaid's luncheon...So I was thinking, what if I came up to Austin Thursday night and we made a trip to the Saxon Pub.  Just a thought.  If you have exams, papers, etc. that will be consuming you that week disregard the suggestion, but if not it could be fun.  Hope you're having a good day and that you finished your Note to your satisfaction.
