Subject: TW compliance filing

I know you do not want to think about this today, but I'm just thinking ahead 
to next week.  Let's come up with an action plan for drafting TW's Order 637 
compliance filing.  You two should be experts by now!  Give me a call Monday 
or Tuesday, and let's discuss getting started, and I will get to work on a 
draft.  I still have the marked up tariff sheets from when we talked about 
this in March or April.
