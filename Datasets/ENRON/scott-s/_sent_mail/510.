No need to apologize for keeping me out Wednesday night, it was probably more 
a case of me keeping myself out (I have been known to do that on occasion).  
I'm sorry I didn't return your call yesterday, but I had a pretty crazy day 
here and that mixed with me only running on about two cylinders effectively 
cut me off from the outside world.  As for being upset about anything, don't 
worry I'm not.  You know me well enough to know that my actions are my own.  
I'm not sure if I'm going to stay in Austin Saturday night or not, but in 
case I do my cell # is 281-844-0866.  

Susan

I'll see you at Purvi's happy hour if you end up going.
