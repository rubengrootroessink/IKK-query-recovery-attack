You crack me up.  I was going to email you today and tell you about the Bruce 
Cockburn concert.  I am definitely interested.  Don't know what I'm doing 
this weekend, nothing scheduled as of yet so let's try and do something.  
Yes, I am interested in chipping in on a gift, just let me know what and how 
much.  I've heard that I-10 Chronicles CD is really good, I'll have to check 
it out.  Also, do you have Ray Wylie Hubbard's Crusades of the Restless 
Knights?  Every cut I hear from it on KPFT is so good.  Sorry so short with 
the email.  Even though they may be short I should be able to email 
throughout the day.

Subject: wedding gift....


... hey you, are you interested in going in on a gift for Jessica and Clay
from Dished from the Past?  We want to get them something nicer that costs a
little more... Emily and Lisa and I are going in together so far...

It was so good to see you last night although when we're in groups like that
I feel like I don't really get to hear SCOOP... did you end up going to
Woody's?

I heard on KPFT this mornig that Bruce Cockburn is coming to Aerial Theatre
May 11th and that would be an awesome concert too... we may have to go to
that one too!  He sings "Last Night of the World" and then this amazing song
that was on around 7:40 this morning that you may have heard... so good!  Oh
my goodness Susan, I forgot to tell you about this new cd I bought
Wednesday... The I-10 Chronicles... I heard about it on KPFT and it is
awesome!!! It's a compilation cd with Joe Ely, Adam Duritz, Willie Nelson
and more... you of all people would love it! :o)

Okay, now that I've filled you in on all I have for now... let me know what
you're up to this weekend...maybe we can veg together...

Happy Friday!

-Jen
