I just finished having lunch with Tobin and he filled me in a bit about this 
morning's meeting.  I don't know how you reacted, if you were upset, etc.  
but I wanted to offer this up if you were struggling with the situation.  
Whatever happens and whatever is said about your move don't ever lose sight 
of the fact that in every aspect of this situation you conducted yourself in 
the best and most open manner possible.  In no way can or should your conduct 
be called into question.  Bearing that in mind any criticism that was 
expressed within the meeting this morning was beyond inappropriate.  I am 
sure it reflected much more poorly on the accuser than it did any of those 
being criticized.  Furthermore, just keep focused on what an incredible 
opportunity this move is going to be for you and all of the doors it will 
inevitably open.  There isn't a doubt in my mind that you are bound for great 
things, you just have to seize the opportunities that will lead to that when 
they come along (which is exactly what you've done).  

Keep your chin up and whatever you do don't doubt yourself or your actions.
