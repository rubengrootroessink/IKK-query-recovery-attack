Lillian, please see the attached authorization memo.  It is still in draft 
form, but since time is of the essence, Geneva advised me to forward it to 
you now so that you could start working on it.  We would like to have the new 
company formed today if possible.  I will let you know if I make any changes 
to the attached.  In the meantime, please do not hesitate to call if you have 
questions.
