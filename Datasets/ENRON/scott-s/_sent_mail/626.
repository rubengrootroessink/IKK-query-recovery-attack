Subject: Enron Presentation

Dear Recruiting Team Members:

I am forwarding a copy of the Enron presentation to each of you for review.  
Some of you will be asked to do presentations, many will not.  I just wanted 
to send it out to various team members in order to give you an idea of our 
marketing strategy and information on campus.  This is simply for your 
information.  When this presentation is given, it will include  dates 
tailored specifically for each campus based on the dates I have set up 
through career services.

Have a great day!
