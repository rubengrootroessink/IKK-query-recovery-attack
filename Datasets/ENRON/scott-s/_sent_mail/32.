Hi Ashley!  A couple of things.  First of all, my new renter, Doug, wonders 
whether he can just call the utilities & phone and transfer from his name to 
yours (rather than you cancelling and him having to pay any re-hookup fees 
that may apply).   I don't know how it would work; maybe he could conference 
you in when he makes the calls.  For what it is worth, he is a very nice guy 
to deal with, but it is totally up to you and I really don't care one way or 
the other. 

Also, I'm having someone come clean the place so you needn't worry about it, 
in case you were wondering.  I will take care of it (it looks pretty clean 
anyway!).  

Please let me know your new address and I will send you your deposit refund 
next week.

Merci!

Susan
