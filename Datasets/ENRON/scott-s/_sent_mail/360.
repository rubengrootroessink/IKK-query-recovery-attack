Hey K!  Thanks for the note.  Everyone is asking how you're doing.  Sorry to 
hear about your back; I know what it is like.  As much as you are inclined to 
run around and get things done, the thing that worked best for me with my 
back problem was just to recline as much as possible!  My house truly became 
a mess, but guess what, the world did not end.  

I really like your monosyllabic choices for names:  Kyle and Quinn.  For some 
reason I really like the name Elizabeth with both of those.  Perhaps because 
it balances out the unisex quality of the first name.  I think you really 
have to meet the baby before you decide for sure.  Who knows, she might turn 
out to be more of a Gladys!  heh, heh!

The landscapers are almost finished with my yard.  It looks really good.  I 
even have a little palm tree -- required for the Heights.  The last thing is 
to finish the driveway -- right now there are 20 tons of black star gravel 
sitting in the back yard!

Time to work.
Try to take it easy!  
S

Hey Susan! Sorry no e-mail lately. Things have been busy at work. I am also
tardy on my xmas thankyou notes so I'm hoping a computer one will suffice
for you! What would Miss Manners say? Needless to say we love all the stuff
you gave us. I am enjoying the knives - what a difference they make. No more
sawing!  Jim has worn his new shirt many times and loves the book. I too
thought it was a good Christmas, despite the pre-Christmas funk many of us
went through! It all turned out ok - even our time with Yvette wasn't so
bad!

Things are moving along in baby world. P-nut is moving downwards,
alleviating the pain in my ribs, but now causing sciatica (sp?)  in my right
hip and leg. I feel creaky and it hurts to walk. Not cool - I have too many
things left to do around the house to have to stay off my feet. Oh well. i
suppose it will all get done. We are still searching for the right name and
now need some input since we can't seem to make a decision between us. Here
are our latest choices in no particular order - Grayson, Kyle, Quinn,
Kendall, Lindsey, and Hayley (may be too popular). My favorite combination
is Grayson Scott Shelton. Jim likes Kyle Elizabeth Shelton or Kyle Alison.
Yes, we know Kyle is usually a boy's name, but we had a female intern at JRA
one summer named Kyle and I thought it was cool. One of my baby name books
has both Kyle and Quinn on the "truly unisex names" list. Any comments or
new suggestions are appreciated!

Must get going on work. Hope to hear from you soon.

Karin
