Hey Darren,

I wanted to try and touch and base with you before my arrival in London.  I 
talked to Emily late last week and she seemed to think Friday night was a 
good night to try and get together.  I know you have a bunch of people that 
are going to be in London this weekend, but maybe we could just make it one 
big group outing.  Get back to me when you get a chance and we'll try and set 
something up.

Susan
