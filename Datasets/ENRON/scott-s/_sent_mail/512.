Hi Susan!

Your name has been mentioned for another UT recruiting opportunity.  Brent 
Price and Rick Causey are going up next week and would like to know can you 
accompany them.  Please give Brent's assistant Chatelle Villanueva a buzz @ 
36279 for the details.  Hope you can make it!

Thanks,
Donna
