On January 13, 2000, FERC issued a Section 7(c) certificate for 
Transwestern's Gallup Expansion.  The Commission's order contained two 
conditions:  1) that Transwestern file its discounted rates within 15 days of 
the order, and 2) that Transwestern restructure its relationship with Enron 
Compression Services so that Transwestern will have sufficient operation 
control over the motor at the Gallup compressor station to assume regulatory 
responsibility for the motor's operation, and that Transwestern file a report 
with the Commission stating how it complied with this condition.  
Transwestern accepted the  certificate January 14, 2000 but reserved the 
right to seek rehearing or clarification of the order.  On January 18, 2000, 
Transwestern filed a motion for extension of time to comply with the 
condition that Transwestern file its discounted rates.  Transwestern has 
already filed with the Commission the discounted rates it will charge its 
expansion shippers, subject to a request for confidentiality.   Transwestern 
intends to file a request for rehearing of the January 13 order explaining 
why the Commission erred in ordering Transwestern to publicly disclose its 
discounted rates in advance of the normal time for making such disclosure 
through a discount report.
