Never fear.  I've asked Janet to set up a meeting on Fri. and to make sure 
the core group of you, Drew, Steve and I can attend.  If anyone else can 
attend too, great.  If not, I'm sure we are going to have more than enough 
input on Fri.

You know how much I loathe these meetings with the Hee-Haw gang.  This 
telecon/videocon will likely degrade into a raucous Omaha-led circle jerk 
with everyone else, mostly the Houston group, trying to get a word in 
edgewise.  Is there any way to make this more fruitful?

If we do this, and you want to include me, you'll have to put it together 
before close of business Friday as I'm out all next week for surgery.

Given the overwhelming response so far, I think a meeting may be necessary to 
get this project moving.  Thanks. DF

So far I have not received comments from anyone on the attached.  
If you think it would be productive to get everyone together (possibly as 
early as Friday?) for about an hour to discuss capacity options, I will set 
up a meeting.   Please let me know one way or the other.
Thank you.

Attached is a preliminary draft of a filing for capacity options on 
Transwestern.  The attachments include a filing letter, proposed tariff 
language and a proposed form agreement.

Obviously there are still quite a few details to be worked out.  I am 
distributing a draft at this early stage in hopes of initiating a dialogue 
about the larger issues first.  A few that come to mind are whether we want 
to commit to selling options online, how best to explain or justify the 
option fee, and what specifically in the industry has changed such that FERC 
should depart from existing policy and allow TW to essentially reserve future 
capacity for shippers.  Please let me know your thoughts on these and any 
other issues.  

I would prefer to wait to discuss comments on wording, other conforming 
changes to the tariff, and other comments concerning form until after we have 
resolved the substantive issues.  Thanks.
