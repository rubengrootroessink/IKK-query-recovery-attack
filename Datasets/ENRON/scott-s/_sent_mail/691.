Same dude...and he is good.  We're going to Steak Night tonight at Little 
Woodrows which of course makes me happy.  Also, I just sent him a list of all 
the UT games so he can start planning to attend.  As soon as he decides on a 
first game I'm going to have to start preparing him to meet the family and 
others.  That's a lot of prep work.
