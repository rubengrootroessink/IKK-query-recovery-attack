Hi!   Thanks for the update, it is good to hear from you.  Sorry Grayson is 
being a crybaby.  It is tough being a baby, I think.  How did the doctor's 
app't go?  Bet you are ready for the weekend so Jim'll be around all day.  
Every working mom I know could not wait to get back to the office after 
maternity leave.  I think the daycare arrangement is generally best for 
everyone.  Baby gets a head start on her social life, and the parents can't 
wait to see the kid at the end of the work day!  Most everyone I know is 
raising their kids that way, and they seem to be turning out fine.  Even the 
handful of stay-at-home moms I've met leave their kids with someone several 
days a week, for sanity's sake.

Had lunch with Mema on Wednesday at Treebeards.  I get the impression that 
she's gotten the message that you and Jim don't exactly want her dropping in 
for spontaneous visits, so that's good.  I always enjoy meeting her for 
lunch--for some reason she's always on best behavior, and we always run into 
my coworkers and friends who just think she's the greatest.  Thank God she 
can never remember their names, or she might start calling them for lunch.  

Bill and I saw a play at Diverse Works last night called "Fucking A."  It was 
a take-off on The Scarlet Letter.  I thought it would be funnier but it was 
actually pretty dark.  The bearer of the letter A was an abortionist in a 
strange land working to pay her son's way out of jail.  Despite the subject 
matter it was one of the best plays I've seen in a very long time.  Diverse 
Works is an art space in the warehouse district directly north of downtown.  
(Nancy Littlejohn (Worthington) has her art gallery nearby.)  They mostly 
sponsor dance, dramatic and performance art productions.  A lot of it is 
really over the top, but I've seen some cool things there.  One of my friends 
at work is trying to get me to serve on the board of directors, so I've been 
hanging out there to see whether I like the people.  

Work is driving me nuts, but that's what they pay me for, I guess.

Time to read more FERC cases.  I don't wanna FERC, I just want to bang on the 
drum all day.

Hang in there, and please send more news of little bug!

Love,
Susan
