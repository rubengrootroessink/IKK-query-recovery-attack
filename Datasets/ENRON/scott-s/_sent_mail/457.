Sorry it took me so long to get back to you.  Unfortunately, I'm not a 
betting woman (I'm afraid any team I bet on is automatically jinxed and I 
can't vote against my alma mater)...so I will kindly refrain from any 
wagers.  

Have a great Thanksgiving Holiday,
Susan

The options book is still the options book and I think I will have put in at 
least 36 of my 40 hours this week.  I know, I know...I'm not working hard 
enough,

So are you up for any friendly or unfriendly bets on this weeks big show
down?  I don't think the lines are out yet but I'm sure you guys will be
favored by at least a touchdown.  So I'll take the Aggies +7.  How about the
loser either picks up the first round or the whole night the next time we
hit the town, although the later might be pretty steep.  Don't know if your
a gambling gal but I thought I would at least present this opportunity to
you.

Anyway, how's the old option book?  Are you getting a handle on the whole
macro thing?  Look on the bright side it is only a three day week and I'm
sure you'll get the whole 40 in.

Take it easy.

Kyle
