Gwen,

Dolores Muzzy gave me your name as a contact for information regarding the 
redesigned Analyst/Associate programs.  I am currently half-way through my 
second rotation with the Analyst program and was hoping to get a better idea 
of the different opportunities available to me upon completion of my current 
rotation.  Although six months seems like a fair amount of time to plan my 
next move, I know how quickly it will pass and do not want to find myself 
uncertain as to what action to take to insure that I am heading in the right 
direction to meet my current goals.  I would appreciate the opportunity to 
meet with you and discuss the aforementioned topics at your earliest 
convenience.  If there is another individual you feel would be a better 
contact for me at this point I would be happy to meet with them as well. 

Thank you,

Susan Scott
