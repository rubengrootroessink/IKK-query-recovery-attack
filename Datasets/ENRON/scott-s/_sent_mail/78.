Denise, a few weeks ago someone who is charge of computer stuff (in Omaha, I 
believe -- I cannot remember her name) called and we discussed replacing my 2 
machines with a laptop.  Do you know who I am talking about?  I think I had 
you call her to give her info on my upstairs computer.  Anyhow, before we 
order anything it might be good to make sure she and Jeff Nguyen are on the 
same page about this.  Could you follow up on this?  Let me know if you have 
trouble getting in touch w/the right people.  Thanks.

Just let me know what you want, and I'll ask Drew to approve it, and I'll get 
it ordered.  You'll probably also want a docking station, which is listed on 
the purchase requisition as "Other Options Available."

Karon,

Can you give, Susan Scott, a price quote on an Armada M700, and two docking 
port replicators.  She is wanting to purchase these items, but needs to know 
the pricing first.  

Thanks,
Jeff Nguyen
