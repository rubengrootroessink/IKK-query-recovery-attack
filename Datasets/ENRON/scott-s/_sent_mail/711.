"1. Do what's right. Be on time, be polite, and be honest; remain free from 
drugs; and if you have any questions, get out your Bible. 
2. Do your best. Mediocrity is unacceptable when you are capable of doing 
better. 
3. Treat others as you want to be treated. Practice love and understanding." 
           -- Lou Holtz (Three rules for success)

 May there always be work for your hands to do, 
 May your purse always hold a coin or two. 
 May the sun always shine warm on your windowpane, 
 May a rainbow be certain to follow each rain. 
 May the hand of a friend always be near you, And may God fill your heart 
with gladness to cheer you. -- Irish Blessing
