Hey buddy,

Out of curiosity, what all are you bringing with you to San Antonio?  I'm running into some problems in the area of cocktail dresses as I developed some noticeable tan lines from my trip.  Oh well, I guess they're not that big a deal right?  

Also, do you just want to swing by my complex Friday morning to pick me up?  I promise not to run too late.

Talk to you soon,
Susan
