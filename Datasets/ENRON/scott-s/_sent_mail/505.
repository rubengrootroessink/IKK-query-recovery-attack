Hey,

Quick question, I was hoping to go get my car detailed this weekend and I 
remembered that you had your truck detailed a while back...I was wondering 
where you had it done and if you thought they did a good job ( I'm assuming 
the place is pretty close to our area of town).  I finally got into the 
parking garage and have decided I now have real incentive to keep my car 
looking nice.

Hope things are well with you.  I talked to Darren last week and it sounds as 
though he is extremely busy these days.  I'm guessing the story's much the 
same with you - a far cry from the listless days you two spent in Net Works.  
Anyway, if you could let me know about the detailing I would appreciate it.

Susan

By the way, since there's no telling if I'll have the opportunity to gloat 
two weeks from now (Tech in Lubbock is never a safe bet) - and while neither 
season has been one for the record books (except of course for our loss to OU 
- one of the worst in history) - I noticed that unlike the Longhorns, your 
beloved Bruins are conspicuously absent from the top 25.  Oh well, c'est la 
vie.
