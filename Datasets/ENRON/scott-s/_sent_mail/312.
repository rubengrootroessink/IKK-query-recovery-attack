Sorry Toby, but honestly this is the first time I've seen such a request.
A lot of things get sent to Susan Scott of ECT by mistake; maybe that is what 
happened?
I would never ignore you on purpose.
I'll call Ms. Lee and give her the correct info.

 I never received an answer on her last request.  Can you please reply to 
this person.

 Thanks
