Hey Darren,

Thanks for the prompt response.  Sorry you won't be able to make it, but I 
will definitely keep you posted regarding any future group outings 
(especially since I still owe you a beer).  Glad you liked the quote, it does 
provide a good chuckle.  

If I'd have known you were going to be in London this week I would have 
forewarned Katy and Emily as they're both over there now as well - I assume 
you're there for work though and therefore a tad busy.  Anyway, hope you're 
having a good time and not working too hard...

Susan

Susan,

Hope you are well.  Unfortunately I will not be able to participate.  
I will not return from London until Friday (maybe Thursday night).  
Keep me posted for the weeks ahead.  Love the quote--and I 
agree whole-heartedly.

--Darren
