Shelley, once the filing is made at the Commission, I will hand deliver

Flanders who set up the OMTR/policy meeting):  Bob Flanders, Ed Murrell, 
Laurel Hyde, Kim Bruno, Kathleen Dias, Demi Pulas, Mike Coleman, Bob 
Petrocelli and John Carlson.

PLEASE NOTE that I will be at a technical conference at FERC tomorrow.  All
