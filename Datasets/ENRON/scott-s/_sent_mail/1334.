Subject:	Summary of GridFlorida approval





On March 28, FERC provisionally approved the GridFlorida RTO.

Some positive aspects for EPMI:

States that EPMI's proposal for a real time energy market has "theoretical merit", but practically may not be implemented when operational.  Encourages consideration of our proposal and how it could be practically implemented.
Grants EPMI's protest that Applicants cannot acquire software and other systems implementing market design until after the independent Board is seated and given its approval.
