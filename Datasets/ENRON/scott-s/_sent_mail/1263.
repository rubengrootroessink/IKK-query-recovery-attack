Hi DeShonda,

I had emailed a week or two ago in regards to the new parking and haven't h=
eard anything back yet.  Could you drop me a line at your earliest convenie=
nce and let me know if it will be possible for me to obtain a space.

Thanks,
Susan M. Scott

rrently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly empl=
oyee cost of $94.00.

ened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street lev=
el entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. Ga=
rage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an=
 exit in the event of elevator trouble.=20

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Pa=
rking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your em=
ail, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and=
 receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the =
new garage.
