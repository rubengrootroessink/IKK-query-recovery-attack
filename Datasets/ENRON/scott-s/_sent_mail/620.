Hey,

Try lgillet@enron.com for Lisa's email address.  Glad to hear you're in the 
new pad...in the interest of saving $$$ I will probably take you up on the 
futon offer.  

Well, it's Monday and I'm assuming Ted's back in town (not that I've heard a 
peep out of him).  I'm very much at a cross-roads with the situation.  On the 
one hand, I want to be unaffected and aloof and on the other hand I don't 
want to make this that easy for him.  I think I deserve more that just being 
swept under the rug.  So, my debate becomes - Do I just let this thing go all 
together OR do I try and get some resolution?  

I would love to get a call from you hear at work.  The best time for me is 
probably before 11:30 or after 12:30 Houston time.  

Talk to you soon,
Susan
