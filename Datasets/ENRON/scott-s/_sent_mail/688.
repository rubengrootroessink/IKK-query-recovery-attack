Sorry I couldn't make it for cake last night.  I had to work late last 
night...Big Shock!!!  Anyway, hope it was fun and that you're having a great 
week.  Mine has been pretty busy work wise.  I'm sure you're curious about 
Mr. Noble.  All I can say right now is that, while I definitely still like 
him (we had a great time Sunday), I am some what annoyed with him right 
now...he's been very wishy-washy the first half of this week.  I'm not real 
sure what I'm going to do about it, but I'm sure I'll think of something.
