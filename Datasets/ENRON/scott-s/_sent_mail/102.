Yes and Yes.  I'd like our Houston lawyers to attend the Houston presentation 
and if you can do one up here, I'd like our Omaha lawyers to attend also.  
Thanks.  DF

Subject: UAF Presentation

For the past two months I have been visiting the GPG Operations Regional 
offices giving a presentation on physical "UAF Fundamentals and Issues" .

The presentation has been very well received.  Interest is high, and numerous 
questions have been raised at each meeting.  The presentation can be given in 
50 minutes if questions are limited.  It has taken up to 3 hours due to the 
amount of questions from the attendees. 

One  focus of these meetings is to give the field staff a better 
understanding of the impact  UAF has on our bottom line (TW) and  the impact 
it has on our shipper costs (NNG). 

Yesterday, 10/4/00 I had the opportunity to meet with several members of the 
financial group in Houston to discuss UAF.  Coming out of that meeting was a 
request to schedule a Houston presentation on "UAF Fundamentals".  This has 
been done, and will be at 1 PM on Oct. 18, 2000. (Place yet to be determined.)

Two Questions:

Is there any interest in having me give the presentation in Omaha?????
Do you have any staff in Houston that you would like  to invite to the 10/18 
presentation????


Copy of the presentation if you are interested:     

Thanks  Steve  37885
