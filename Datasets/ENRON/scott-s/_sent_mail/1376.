Julie,

I don't know if I told you before, but I'm leaving tomorrow for a long weekend in the Caymans with my new group.  I can't tell you how much my life has changed in the last three weeks.  I'm getting out of the office no later than 6:30 everyday (and it's usually closer to 4:30-5:00) and I actually have time to do other things with my life.  I went to the symphony last week, am going to a reception at the MFA next week, joined a volunteer organization geared toward young professionals and am thinking about joining the church I've been going to the last couple of months.  All in all life has improved.  Still nothing new on the guy front, but I'm in no rush so it's not that big a deal.

I am so excited about my trip out to San Diego to see you.  I promise to be well rested and ready to shop, eat and go out....or just sit on the beach.  Like I said before, I'm up for anything.  

Hope things are going well with you, the job and Brendan.  Drop me a line if you get a chance and let me know what's new in your life.

Talk to you soon,
Susan
