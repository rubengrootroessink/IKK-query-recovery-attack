Trip was excellent.  I took pictures, but most of them where taken inside 
pubs so who knows how they'll turn out.  I definitely thought about you and 
how much you would love the area Emily's living in (very upscale, English and 
proper).  I also had an impromptu interview thanks to Dave Oliver so we'll 
see.  I will talk to you more later as I am in the thick of calcing and am 
suffering a bit of jet lag.

Hello my friend. Hope you are well. First, how was your trip? Secondly, did 
you get many pictures? Thirdly, did you think about me the whole time you 
were there...saying in your mind "Tobin would have liked this?"
Drop a note and give me the dirt.
