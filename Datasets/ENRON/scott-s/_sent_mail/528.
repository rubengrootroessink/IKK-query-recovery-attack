    For October 19: Put the obsession and dedication back into your job,
                     health, and daily life. Stressful matters beyond your 
control have leached away
                     much of the excitement that makes life enjoyable. Use 
this Mercury retro
                     period to reinvent your work philosophy and improve your 
health and lifestyle.
                     The resources and relief you seek are available, but you 
may be expected to
                     kowtow and kiss butt to get what you need. Are you 
willing -- or not? I can't
                     blame you if your high standards won't allow anything to 
compromise your
                     vision. But if you're feeling pragmatic, use the next 3 
weeks to cook up an
                     agreement you can live with.
