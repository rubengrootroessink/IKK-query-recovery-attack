Hi Mum!  Well, I mustered the courage to start my bathroom painting project 
yesterday.  I chose a medium blue that looks very nice.  Guess who helped 
me?  Bill!  He got pretty enthusiastic with that roller.  So we were able to 
knock it out in about 3 hours.  There was a lot of woodwork to tape off.  
Tonight I will finish the tub area, which needed some 
repair/caulking/spackling.  Now I am anxious to do the bedroom, but probably 
will not get to it until next month.  Maybe you will be able to help me 
decide on a color when you are here this weekend.  I'm torn between "Happy 
Yellow" and a lighter version of the blue I used in the bathroom.  If I 
decide to paint any of the downstairs, I believe I will entrust that work to 
the professionals.

Got 4 tickets to the dance performance.  Since Bill seems to genuinely enjoy 
dance, I invited him.  So that leaves us with one ticket.  If you would like 
to invite someone, just let me know; otherwise maybe one of my friends around 
here will join us.

Hope your weekend project was a success.  

Talk to you soon!

Love,
S.
