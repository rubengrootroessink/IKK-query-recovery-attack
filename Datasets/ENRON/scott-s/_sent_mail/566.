Hey Ashley,

Just thought I'd drop you a line to let you know that I will be in London 
this Friday through next Tuesday.  I'm visiting a friend of mine who is 
attending Sotheby's graduate program.  I know it's short notice, but I would 
love to see you at some point while I'm over there.  If you get a chance 
email me back and let me know if you're free any of those days and how I can 
get a hold of you while I'm over there.  Hope all is well.

Susan
