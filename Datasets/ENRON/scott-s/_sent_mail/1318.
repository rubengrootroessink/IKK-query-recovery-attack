So...the weekend I was talking about coming to Austin the following people are playing:

	Fri	The Fabulous Thunderbirds	Gruene Hall
	Fri	Cory Morrow			Luckenbach Dance Hall

	Sat	Reckless Kelly			Antone's
	Sat	Lucinda Williams		Gruene Hall

Just more food for thought.

Actually, I flew out to San Diego Thursday night.  It was incredible...I cannot believe that there are places where the weather, scenery and people are that beautiful.  Seriously, I think I could find a lot of guys to be interested in there.  Strapping, physically fit beach boys with awesome dogs and a decent amount of world travel behind them.  

Hope you had a good Easter Weekend and that school isn't getting too stressful.  I'm guessing you're coming up on some serious exam time in the near future.  

I'm off to Vegas this weekend, but I was debating the prospect of Austin the weekend of the 28th.  Let me know if you're going to be around/able to socialize (even if only briefly) that weekend.  I really want to come up to see Kathy and Travis's new house...I feel bad they've been in it for over a month and I haven't even seen it yet.

Talk to you soon,
Sue

I liked that-- and I deinitely agree!  I have done about half of those
things...  Not too bad for a spoiled brat.

Are you leaving for San Diego tomorrow?  I am coming in town tomorrow, but I
bet I am going to miss you.
