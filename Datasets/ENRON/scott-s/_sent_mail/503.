Kyle,

I want you to know how much getting your email today meant to me.  I was 
hoping to be able to respond with the same kind of care and consideration you 
showed, but - as you can see from the time on this email - today has been a 
bit on the rough side.  I will continue my thoughts tomorrow when I have more 
time to gather them, but until then I wanted you to know that I did get the 
email and that it contained quite possibly some of the kindest and most 
touching things ever said to me.  And, please know that you would never, ever 
be put in one of my stalker catagories...you could never be lumped in any 
catagory with the SP's of the world.

Susan

As for the good-bye, I would have to give it high marks as well.
