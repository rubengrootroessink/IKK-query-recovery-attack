I am very excited about my trip to London.  For one thing I get to visit 
Emily, but at this point more importantly I don't have to think about work 
for 6 days straight.  You guys are going to have a great trip to China and I 
say if you find a rug that you really like (i.e. you're not just getting one 
because you think you should) you should definitely get it.  Just think what 
a great conversation piece it would make over the years.  

And don't worry about my appetite for travel getting spoiled...that is 
impossible.  I can't wait to see you guys.  I think that you being in Korea 
and Emily being in London has made this whole Ted situation that much harder 
to deal with.  I've realized how much I appreciate y'alls insights now that 
they aren't as easy to get.

Love ya,
Susan
