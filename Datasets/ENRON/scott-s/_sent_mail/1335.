Subject:	One RTO Entergy to GridSouth

I talked with Rogers, who said that it makes sense for us to advocate one RTO from Entergy through Southern into GridSouth (presumably getting TVA to commit at some point to an RTO).  Florida should probably be separate.  SPP could be in this RTO or the Midwest.  Therefore, the overall theme that Jim discussed this morning (that FERC has started something somewhat positive, but should take the step to actually state that it wants these utilities to work toward one SE RTO) can be put into the GridSouth and Southern request for rehearing (Tom C. is getting the draft of this.)  Thanks.
