Mom said she was keeping you up to date on everything.  So, of course, I 
spent the whole weekend trying to figure out how I want to handle this 
"situation".  Basically I've decided the following:
 1.  I will agree to meet him for a beer and a chat (I'm going to suggest 
Molina's - I think it's a good location, public enough & private enough)
 2.  I will be calling and leaving a message with him to let him know I will 
meet with him, NO email... and will request that he do me the same courtesy.
 3.  I will let him do the talking (I mean he's the one that wants to have a 
chat so he must have something to say)...at least to begin with
 4.  I will NOT be a push-over (it's not in my character anyway)

Well, what do you think?  Any suggestions/recommendations?  I am very new to 
this whole relationship discussion thing.  Most importantly, do you think 
there is anything he could say/do that would or should allow him a second 
chance?  Right now I don't know if there is.

PS - I think I'm going to come over with Mom and Dad now in November.  I've 
been checking out airfare recently, ouch!  Anyway, I think were shooting for 
Nov. 9-14.  Talk to you soon.

I heard about the ongoing saga you are currently in
the middle of.  The nerve of that boy!  I think you
are right not jumping to return his e mail.  What a
coward, that he had to e mail you and didn't even have
the decency to call you.  What a weirdo!
