Chad, attached is the draft of the Measurement and Control Facilities 
Operating Agreement for Calpine's review.  As we discussed, because the 
exhibits are still being finalized, I have not included them in this draft.  
If you have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Thank you.
