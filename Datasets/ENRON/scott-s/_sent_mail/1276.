Okay, so I'd really like to make a trip up there this weekend ( I haven't spent a weekend in Houston during April and can't imagine why I wouldn't just make the month a clean sweep).  Anyway, I know you're unbelievably busy right now and spending an entire weekend with me would not help you in the least...So, here's my suggestion:

I could either come up Friday night and we could do a late dinner (say 8:30-9:00 ) and then find someplace to hang out for a while or just rent a movie.  On Saturday we could get up, work out, grab something for brunch/lunch and maybe even go to Barton Springs (depending on the weather) and then I could take off and leave you the rest of Saturday and all of Sunday to work (we could even skip the Barton Springs piece).

The other option is to just shift everything a day forward...I'd come up on Saturday and leave Sunday.

Either give me a call or email me if either of these sound good to you.  I will also completely understand if you just really need to work/study this weekend.

PS - I'm dying for someone to chat with about Vegas...can't really talk to my roommate since it was work related.
