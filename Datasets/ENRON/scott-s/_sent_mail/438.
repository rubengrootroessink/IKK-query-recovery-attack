The apartment complex needs for you to fax them a statement saying you are no 
longer living in our apartment and they need it by tomorrow morning.  If I 
don't here from you via email/msngr  by the end of tonight I'm going to forge 
one and fax it to them.  Actually, I can do that regardless if you don't 
mind.  Just drop me a line and let me know what works for you.

Hope things are going well.  I actually worked 21 straight hours the other 
day/night (7:45 am Tuesday until 4:45 am Wednesday)...I think this 
constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.
