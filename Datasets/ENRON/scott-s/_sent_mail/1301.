I think there's probably a lot of truth to the Eric theory.  The retaliatio=
n/numbing afforded by using people and tossing them aside can be tempting. =
 My  mini-rampage after Ted was totally based upon treating any representat=
ive of Ted's sex like dirt.  Fortunately, my behavior was very short-lived =
and I completely recognized what I was doing.  I wouldn't worry about the l=
ecturing...it happens when one has a bit to drink (that or just utter flapp=
ing as in my case). =20

Thanks for the compliments, but I find it's easy to be around all of your f=
riends...that whole like attracts like thing.  As for the email from Clint,=
 he's a cutie.  Speaking from experience I'd watch myself if I were you tho=
ugh...the flirtation is fun and harmless at this point, but I get the impre=
ssion that you're just Clint's type and unless you have reciprocal interest=
 I would just guard against things getting to be too flirtatious.  However,=
 if there's part of you that is curious, like I said, I think he's a great =
guy.  Okay, enough of my lecturing (I've just been caught in a couple of si=
tuations at work where someone decides to confess their feelings to me and =
I'm forced to tell them I just don't feel the same way...something that's h=
ard for them to grasp given the fact that some flirting at some point did o=
ccur).

Well, I'm off to Vegas this weekend.  My guess is I won't be getting much s=
leep.  Oh well, life is tough.

hey susan-  thought you'd appreciate this funny email from Clint in London.=
...  so in brief, my new theory is that eric gomez has had his heart broken=
 (per "Someone Like You") and therefore must act like a slut to ignore the =
pain.  Heather and I ran that theory past Randall last night at the padres =
game.....i am slightly mortified at how i lectured eric on saturday.  at fi=
rst he thought it was sweet because it demonstrated that i do care about hi=
m (on some level), but as i drank more i LECTURE more, until he finally sta=
rted walking away from me!  how embarrassing!  i am totally embarrassed tha=
t i wouldn't shut up!  even more surprised that eric sent me the email on m=
onday.  i didn't see it until tuesday since i didn't work monday, but am bu=
mmed because i called him monday evening to get eric ang's phone number....=
.silly concern, but he probably thinks i was calling just to get in touch w=
ith him.  now  i will totally not make contact with him- not even respond t=
o his email...don't need to overinflate people's egos!

i would love if you came back to visit at some point in the next 5 or so mo=
nths!! i love that you have so much fun here, and everyone always comments =
on how cool you are and how easy you are to be around.....everyone would be=
 thrilled to have you back! (me especially!)  i'll watch for good fares, to=
o!

write back whenever you can....talk to you soon-
julie

Julie,

Thanks for letting us hang out with you on the beach Sat.  It was good to
see you.  All your friends are very cool.  Say thanks to Clint for me if yo=
u
get the chance.  We didn't last much longer that night, thank goodness.
I hope you had a nice Easter.  Other than the Lakers beating the Blazers it
was a pretty boring day.  Not to mention I was brain dead from the pickling
the two days before.
Have a good week.

Eric
