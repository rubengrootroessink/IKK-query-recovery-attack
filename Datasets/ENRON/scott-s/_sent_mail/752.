AQUARIUS

                   For April 17-23: Travel plans shape up and
                   morph into much more. Every step you take
                   seems to branch out into a sea of possibilities --
                   especially lately. The old rules don't apply
                   anymore. The idea of signing up for something
                   and hanging in there until retirement doesn't suit
                   an innovator like you. Your developing success
                   will beget an avalanche of more success. Have
                   your bags packed in preparation for spur of the
                   moment opportunities and travel necessities.
                   Your wanderlust is starting to surface in a big
               way. You want to know more and experience life
               on a richer level. You're not the same person
               you were even a year ago. You understand more
               about yourself. Be open to travel, moving,
               advanced training, and additional contact with
               media and publishing. The word is out, Aquarius
                   -- and hard-to-pass-up offers are already in the
                   mail. . . .
