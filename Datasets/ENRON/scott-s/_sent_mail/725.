I apologise for the delay in my response to your email.  Thank you for 
contacting me regarding the rotational opportunity in your group.  While it 
sounds intriguing, I will not be able to pursue it as I have already begun my 
second rotation with ENA.  However, I would appreciate the opportunity to 
learn more about your group and any possible future rotations.  Please let me 
know if you would be able to meet at some later date.  Thank you again.

Subject: Rotation Opportunity

Susan,

I received your resume from the analyst/associate pool and understand that 
you will be rotating soon.  I'm a manager for EES Europe looking for an 
analyst to be  based in Houston who can join within the next two months.  If 
you have an interest in discussing this opportunity, please call me so that 
we can set-up a time to talk.
