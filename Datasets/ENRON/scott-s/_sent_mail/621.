Just to forewarn you two, it looks like Darren (Ted's buddy) is going to be 
in London for a few months working on a project.  When I mentioned you two 
were both over there right now he asked me for your email addresses.  No 
pressure for you guys to do anything with him, but I do like the guy and 
think when I come over we will definitely have to do something with him (and 
Nick too of course...maybe the same night, that whole "kill two birds with 
one stone concept").

Side-note:  I'm am dying of curiosity as to why Darren is going to London for 
a project and Ted is trading corn here.  Maybe I'll find out before Darren 
leaves.  
       Who knows, maybe if you all see Darren over there you can find out 
what the heck happened with our once so promising Mr. Noble.
