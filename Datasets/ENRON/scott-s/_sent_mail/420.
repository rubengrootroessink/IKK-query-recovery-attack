Hey Bronwyn,

I just realized I never emailed you back ( I am a bad, bad person).  Glad to 
hear things are going well with you.  It was so neat to run into you in 
Houston, I see your brother around the building quite a bit but I don't think 
he recognizes me.  I'll have to make a point to reintroduce myself the next 
time I see him.  

So what's new with you?  Have you moved?  I know you were thinking about LA a 
while back...I've got a couple of friends from high school who are living out 
there and are really having a good time.  Anyway, I completely understand the 
urge to try something new.  I too am thinking of making a move before next 
summer ( I don't know exactly where, but somewhere outside of Texas...I 
really need to experience something different).  Speaking of which, Emily is 
in London going to graduate school right now.  I've already been to visit her 
once there and she's trying to talk me into moving over there.  I would 
actually love to go, if there was a job with Enron there that interested me.  

As for my dating life, it is relatively unchanged.  I was seeing one guy for 
a while, really liked him, things were going great ( I thought )...then he 
seemed to loose interest and decided 2 mos. into things to tell me he has 
issues and that he'd been married before.  Needless to say, that was pretty 
much the end of things.  It's made me a little hesitant when it comes to 
meeting new guys, but at the same time I had so much fun in the beginning 
that I'm still optimistic about my dating future.  How about you?

Concerning Kappa...I'll give you a run down on everyone I still keep in touch 
with.  Corey's in Law School at Texas ( doing great of course) and has 
already secured a clerkship with a federal judge in Galveston when she 
graduates.  Jessica Bateman is now Jessica Pulliam - and she too is in Law 
School at Texas and has secured a federal clerkship with a judge in Dallas 
when she graduates.  Elizabeth's is in Med School in San Antonio and dating a 
fellow med student there.  Stephanie Spence is now Stephanie Williams and is 
living and working in Dallas.  Lisa Meador is getting married next April to a 
guy from Texas ( he was a KA, there Brad Thealman (sp?) ) who is absolutely 
perfect for her.  That about sums it up, but if there's anyone else you're 
wondering about just ask...I can probably find out some scoop.

Talk to you soon,
Susan

Hi Susan!  How are you?  It was so good seeing you when I was in Houston!  I 
really had tried to find out your e-mail address b/c I've often wondered what 
your were up to.  I'm glad to hear your enjoying work.  Are you happy to be 
back in Houston?  (I guess you've been back for awhile now...)  How's your 
family?  Do you still talk to Emily?

I've visited Houston every so often to see Ryan...I still always have the 
greatest time when I visit.  I'm trying to decide right now where I want to 
live.  I have the flexibility with my job to live wherever I choose, so I've 
been thinking about LA.  I'm torn though b/c I like Houston, too.  I'm 
thinking about just playing in LA for about a year and then probably settling 
down in Houston.  We'll see...

What else is going on with you?  Are you dating any one?  Do you still keep 
in touch with any Kappas?

Well, sorry for all the questions, but I can't wait to hear from 
you...hopefully, we can stay in touch!

Take care, Bronwyn
