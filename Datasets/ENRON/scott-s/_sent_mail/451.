   I'd told my theory to my friend Linda, who wanted to be a social scientist 
and was always coming up with theories herself.  I'd concluded that breasts 
were to sex what pillows were to sleep.  "Guys might think they want a 
pillow, but they'll sleep just as well without one."
     She'd said, "Guys will sleep anywhere if they're really tired."
