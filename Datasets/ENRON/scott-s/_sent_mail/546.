Hey guys,

Well I'm back home in Houston looking out at our lovely skyline (okay, maybe 
it's not that lovely but it is sunny here).  Anyway, I'm so glad I got the 
chance to see all of you while I was in London.  It seemed as though all of 
you are really enjoying your time in the UK - which is good to hear given the 
fact I'm hoping to make it over there myself.  Hope the approaching close to 
2000 finds everyone in good spirits.

Cheers,
Susan
