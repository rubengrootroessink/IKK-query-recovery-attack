Actually...I the first available appointment on Sat is 2:00 pm (right in the thick of beach time!!).  I ended up making my reservation yesterday for 11:00 am tomorrow, I might be able to switch it to 10:00 though b/c they still had it open yesterday.  However, the 11:00 may work out perfectly.    That way when my treatment's done at 12:30 we could just start our day from there - lunch, shopping, etc.  What do you think?  I'm sure I can find some way to occupy myself for a couple of hours on Sat...no worries.

hey susan-

any chance you could get into the spa around 10:00 on saturday?  i'm sure that's a popular time, just wanted to see if that was a slot they'd had available....my study group wants to meet at 10 on saturday, and i'm planning to go for just 2 hours, so it would work great if you could do the spa thing then.  if not, then the beach is right across the street from the library where we'll be meeting so i could always join you there after my study session.....it's sprinkling right now but is supposed to clear up tomorrow and be sunny this weekend ( i hope!!). 

i cannot wait to have a weekend to relax- it has been so crazy here! 

i'll see you tonight!!worst case scenario (contingent upon weather and traffic) i'll pick you up at continental curbside baggage claim.....travel safely!

julie
