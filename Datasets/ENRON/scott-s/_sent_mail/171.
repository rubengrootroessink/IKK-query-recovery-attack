After our IOS adventure last week, I put together the following questions=
=20
that need to be resolved.  Some of them have needed to be resolved for quit=
e=20
some time.  Tony, let's talk since I think some of these have already been=
=20
discussed and maybe resolved in the context of developing TW's EnronOnline=
=20
site, and I just need to get up to speed.  To the extent there aren't answe=
rs=20
yet, I'll get busy researching.  Drew -- comments?  Shall we all get on the=
=20
phone & discuss this?

List of TW contracting issues

1.  Reevaluate the following in the context of current FERC negotiated rate=
=20
policy:

 a.  Transwestern's current form discount letter states:  "[t]he total char=
ge=20
shall include all applicable surcharges."   Should this language be revised=
,=20
and if so, how?

 b.  Transwestern usually charges one-part rates, and includes language in=
=20
its discount letter stating that Transwestern shall allocate the combined=
=20
rate between the reservation and commodity components inclusive of=20
surcharges.  Are one-part rates really negotiated rates?  material deviatio=
ns=20
from the tariff?=20

 c.  Transwestern's discount letter includes a statement that in no event=
=20
shall the contract rate be greater than the maximum or lower than the minim=
um=20
rates provided in Transwestern=01,s tariff.  This was intended as assurance=
 that=20
the contract is not a negotiated rate.  Is this language still effective? =
=20
necessary?

2.  IOS/EnronOnline:

 a.  When should IOS be conducted, if at all?

 b.  Once notice of IOS or EnronOnline bidding has been posted, can the=20
subject capacity still be sold off-line (i.e., pursuant to traditional=20
bidding procedures)?

 c.  Is our system for IOS and EnronOnline set up to handle max rate biddin=
g=20
situations in a nondiscriminatory manner and in compliance with the bid=20
evaluation procedures in the tariff?  If not, what changes need to be made?
