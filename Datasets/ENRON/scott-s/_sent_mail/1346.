Hi yourself,

I swear you read my mind sometimes...I was just about to email you.  Anyway, things here are good and I am equally (if not more) excited about my visit.  I know the weather's been kind of funky the last week or so but I've been hearing the same rumours as you regarding a weekend warm-up.  Therefore, I'm still bringing my suit/beach clothes and will just make sure I've got some stuff in case it stays on the chilly side.  I'll also make sure to include some work-out clothes and Sunday attire ( I'm assuming a skirt or dress will work okay? ).

No worries about the need to study.  I've been go-go-go the last couple of weekends and would not mind at all having some down-time during the day for naps, lounging, walking, etc. while you study to your hearts content.  Honestly, we've got plenty of time to do things so it's no big deal.

My flight is supposed to arrive Thursday night at 7:00 and I leave at 3:40 Sunday afternoon ( I got direct flights this time so I won't be nearly as tired).

Hope this week isn't too crazy for you...of course, if it is you'll be more than ready for a little R&R.

Love,
Susan

hi susan-

how are you??  things are super crazy here, so wanted to drop you a note
before it's suddenly thursday!  i am SO excited for your visit and a day
off- i do have to warn you that my statistics mid-term got postponed
(horrible and a relief at the same time) until the monday after easter, so
i may have to study a bit over the weekend....i'll of course try to get it
all done before you get in on thursday, though!  don't want to intrude on
our beach time!

the weather is odd right now- raining and chilly, but they're claiming it
will warm up to 68 by friday- hopefully warmer.....so still definitely
bring your suit, running shoes, and church clothes for Easter.....

what are your flight times?

can't wait to see you!
love,
julie
