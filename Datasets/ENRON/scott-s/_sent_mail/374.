Mary Kay -- please see the attached -- Red Cedar has essentially asked us for 
acknowledgement that TW is willing to allow them to act as agent to transport 
gas for producers even though Red Cedar itself does not have title to the 
gas.  Drew has seen this and says he is going to discuss it with you.
