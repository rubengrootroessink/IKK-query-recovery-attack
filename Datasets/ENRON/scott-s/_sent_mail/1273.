I will definitely think about it...I would just feel bad though missing the event since I talked to Barrett (Deborah's fiancee) all about the big day at Lisa and Brad's wedding.  What may be an option is me taking part or all of Monday off and just heading to Austin Sunday and coming back Monday...I'll talk to my trader about the possibility.

I think you can skip Deborah's wedding.  Your good excuse is that I have to
work the next weekend.  Starting on Thursday (the 10th), I have to do Law
Review stuff until the issue we are working on is finished.  It could be two
weeks-- it could be right up until I have to start work...  I don't really
know.  Of course, I won't be working all day everyday, so we could do
dinner, a movie, etc. that weekend.

I don't want to encourage you not to go to Deborah's wedding, but, frankly,
I am all weddinged out.  Have you made plans to go with anyone?  Maybe
something could mysteriously come up...

Oh well-- it's up to you-- you could decide next Saturday if you want to...

-Corey
