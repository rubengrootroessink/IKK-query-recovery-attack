Hey Shorty,

I am glad to hear that today is going a little better.  We are getting a tad 
busy.  I hope the beers were good last night, and I thought about a couple of 
cold ones as Darren and I were getting finished around 1:30 this morning.  A 
drink sounds good but I may be leaving for Austin tomorrow night after work 
to pick up my friend Mark at the Austin airport (I'll find out later tonight) 
and if that is the case then we'll get one next week.  I think the story 
below is funny.  I'll talk to you later when I get a better sense of what is 
going on.

Hey Pavarotti,

Hope you day is going well and that everything is coming together for the big 
presentation tomorrow.  My day is going significantly better than yesterday 
so I am pleased.  Plus, my friend just emailed me from San Diego to inform me 
that she can get us a great table to see the Symphony's last performance of 
the season on Navy Pier...so I've got that going for me, which is nice.  By 
the way, what did you end up deciding to do about this weekend - or haven't 
you decided yet (the latter would not surprise me in the least...you're a fly 
by the seat of your pants kind of guy or a slight procrastinator - - I always 
get the two confused).

Now for the rule-breaking.  I realize it's already Wednesday but I wanted to 
see if you had any interest in going to grab a bite to eat or just a drink 
after work tomorrow or Friday night (in light of our heavy work loads, etc. I 
hope you can forgive my rudeness).  Both you and Darren looked pretty whipped 
last night and I'm sure tonight will be more of the same...You better be 
careful, I think this project is starting to give you gray hair.

Shorty

- - I forgot to tell you last night that my 5 yr. old niece got in trouble on 
the way to school yesterday because she punched a little boy in the eye.  
Evidently, he was bothering she and her friend Reagan...I think my sister's 
biggest fears have now been confirmed, little Sally may have taken after her 
Aunt Sue Sue a little too much.
