Hey there, enjoyed hearing about your shopping adventures!  Just a quick note 
to say that Bill will be coming with me this weekend, so Mema will have more 
than enough entertainment.  Tell Jim to bring his tennis gear and if the 
weather cooperates we can play.  He would probably enjoy hitting with Bill.  

Saw Bruce Springsteen last night, even though I'm really not much of a fan.  
Ann really wanted to go, and I knew it would be a good show (which it was).  
He played for 3 hours and needless to say I'm pretty worthless this a.m.

Look forward to seeing you soon.

S.
