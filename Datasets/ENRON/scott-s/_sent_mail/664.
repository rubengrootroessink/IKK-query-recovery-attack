i admit to being a little put-off by his 'tone'- if that's the correct word.
  you write a long, jovial, bantering note, and his response is cold and
blunt....it sounds like mr noble's project has zapped out all of his
personality......and we thought one of his better features was his
well-roundedness.....!  again , i think this is one of those subtle and
shaky things you can't really 'call' someone on, and it's best to leave the
ball in his court.  of course, if he comes around when he's less
'distracted', i would tread carefully, and w/ some aloofness- no reason you
should have to 'jump' when he says to! gauge how he acts post-holiday- there
will be no project excuse, and then you can see how much validity this
theory holds.  am completely disoriented right now- sleeping pattern is off,
have raging PMS, and am a little homesick, as i knew i'd be at first.  both
mom and dad  succeeded in slipping horribly weepy cards into my purse before
take-off (which was a weepy mess in itself).  of course, i found them on the
plane and made an absolute scene sniveling and crying big fat baby tears.
verrry attractive!  am going to be really glad actually when school starts
so that i can begin to get acclaimated and don't feel like such a fish out
of water.  need to finalize when you're thinking about coming over.....i
know it's sometimein oct- and kates said she has to leave on the 12th for a
wedding thing.  as i said, jeremy's wedding is the weekend of the 14th, and
i know that was a week you discussed coming.  i don't have tickets, but if
it's physically poss for me to find a good ticket home, i prob. will have
to- gogo started crying when i said i prob. couldn't come, and i promised
i'd try.  but then again, i don't want to mess up the vacation plans you've
been setting up for a long time.  hopefully we can find a 'mutually
beneficial' time for the visit- let me know what you're thinking, and we'll
work from there!  am writing from the computers at katy's school, and don't
know how long i am allowed to, so will try to check back asap!  hope all is
well- miss ya'll!
