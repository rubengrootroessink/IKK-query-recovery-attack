First of all, I'm delighted you want to stay and would not have a problem 
with Deron moving in.  However, in return I would ask for increased rent of 
$650, to take into account the improvements you want and additional water use 
and wear & tear.  After you read this let me know whether you think this is 
reasonable.

I'll try to answer all your questions:

Q. I believe you had mentioned some termite issues and I wanted to
make sure that we would not be doing anything to cause the floor to collapse 
as
we would be removing light items for heavier items. 

A.  I really do not think it is a problem.  In addition to the oak floor, 
there is a subfloor, so heavier items should be fine.  I'd draw the line at a 
waterbed, though!

Q.  The stove is a bit problematic... 

A.  No problem to look into this.  I'm sure it can be repaired.  I will give 
the appliance folks a call.  

Q.  Do you know if the garage apt. would support a 2nd line being installed? 

A.  I'm sure it will...go ahead and do it; if the phone company runs into any 
internal wiring problems let me know and I'll call my phone wiring dude.

Q.  Do you know if the washer/dryer connections in the garage part work for 
sure?

A.  I have a bad feeling about those connections!  I'll get them up and 
running, and can get someone to haul the old washer off.

Q.  I am guessing that they would need to be gas, not electric? 

A.  I would strongly recommend a gas dryer because it is so much more 
economical.  Plus you would not believe how much faster you can get jeans and 
towels dry than with electric!
If I have to get a new connection installed it will be gas if possible.

Q.  At one point, you had mentioned doing something with the kitchen floor as 
the linoleum has seen better days... Would it be possible to look into this?

A.  I have always thought linoleum in a black & white checkerboard pattern 
would look really cute in there.  It's cheap to install and fairly easy 
except I'm leary of taking on the project myself because pulling up the old 
stuff is going to be a you-know-what.  I will call & ask my handyman, unless 
you and Deron are just dying to do it yourselves.

Q.  Do you know if any paint is leftover?

A.  The color I used on the trim was Antique White semigloss; there should be 
some left in the garage.  I'll check and if not I can pick up some for you at 
the paint store as I'll be going there this week or this weekend.

The only additional issue I have is parking -- Dianna is staying with me and 
helping w/rent for the next several months and I'd like her to be able to use 
that middle space.  I know it's a pain but either you or Deron would have to 
park on the street.  The other option is to get one of the back garage doors 
working so there is access to the garage from the alley.  If I did this do 
you think y'all would use it, or is that too impractical?

As for timing with the oven, W/D connections and kitchen floor, I'm taking 
the first full week of Sept. off and it would be easiest for me to get 
everything done then if that's okay with y'all.

Call if you have further questions!
