Hey,

Just wanted to make sure you're still up for the MFA reception tomorrow night.  I told Lisa about it last night and she said she'd like to go as well.  So...the reception is supposed to start at 7:00 and go until 9:00 and I figured we could either go to an early dinner, or cut out of the reception a little bit early and go to dinner afterward (say around 8:00 - 8:30).  Of course, dinner doesn't have to factor in at all if we don't want it to...just a suggestion.  I'll give you call later tonight to hammer out the details.

See ya,
Susan
