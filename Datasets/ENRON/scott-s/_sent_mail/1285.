Hey there,

Bummer about next weekend, although I'm not even positive I'm going so the frustration may be for naught.  As far as the wedding thing goes, thanks for the offer but I wouldn't worry about it.  I think I have a wedding in Houston that weekend anyway.  I'll talk to Jen about coming up the weekend of the 12th so maybe Jessica, Jen, you, me & my friend Corey could all get together.  I've been needing a good Austin fix.  The trip to San Diego was awesome.  We ended up blowing off most of the plans we made so we could just hang out at the beach, drink wine, and eat cheese and crackers (oh yeah, and watch the sun set).  I did find time to go to a spa and get a bodyscrub/massage which was amazing.  I'm off again this weekend so I have to go through the whole packing routine again tonight..augh!  

Hope things are well with you and I'll say high to Lisa and Jen for you tonight.

Sue

I can't respond to my Hotmail account on this machine.  So...

Bummer...I will be out of town the weekend of the 28th (Jazz Fest) and will
be out Friday on the weekend of the 5th.  I will be flying back that
Saturday and will be going to a wedding with most of those guys.  Do you
want me to find out if a certain one needs a date?  Hmmmm...  It's his boss,
so I don't know how that would fly, but I'll find out.

However, I think that I would really like to be in Austin one of the next
two weekends (5/12 & 5/19) and my plans should not in any way limit yours.
Caycie and Jessica (thru 5/14) will be here and Jen pops over all the time.
And, I know that your sis would love to see you!!  Of course, I would hate
to miss you, but since you are in the jet-set I know that your schedule is
really busy.  How was San Diego?  Or, is that this weekend?
