the Cayman Islands

We're leaving in about a 1/2 hour for the airport and I am extremely excited about the trip.  I will be sure to take lots of pictures and drink many fruity drinks.  Actually, I'm going scuba diving tomorrow and then we're taking a catamaran on Saturday out to some island (I will be taking full advantage of the sunning net for the trip out to the island).  Additionally, we've got first class dinners booked every night and I should be able to fit in a massage...I know, it's sick.  

Also, I'm sure you noticed that I emailed Niclas about you so the door has been cracked open...Just a warning though, based on a Tuesday night conversation with Lisa I'm afraid our dear Mitch may be biting the dust soon.  We'll see though, she has become very flighty (okay, is flighty) when it comes to guys.
