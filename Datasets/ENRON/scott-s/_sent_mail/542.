You guys are going to kill me, but I just got a ticket on the floor for the 
Rockets game tonight.  I was hoping I could get cell phone numbers from a few 
of you so that I could maybe meet up with y'all after the game.  I definitely 
want to see everyone and could "go out" later if anyone's interested.

Hey girls,

I'm back from London (the trip was incredible) and would love to see all of 
you this Thursday.  I hope we can all make it.
