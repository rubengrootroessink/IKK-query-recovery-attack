Thanks for thinking of me (the ride back was lovely - lots of gummy food items and carbonated beverages)...i'm very tired from all of the weekend activity though and don't see much rest in my future.  Oh well life is short, right?  

I'm so glad we were able to spend some time together this weekend, and that you got a chance to meet my parents.  I'm going to have to make a trip up to Austin soon for a visit to make sure you're hitting all the must sees/eats.  By the way, how long are you going to be there?

Susan

Maybe I'll hit an "Eaters" outing.

Well, that clarified it...

How are you doing?  I hope that you and Jen had a safe trip back to Houston.
I thought of you this morning when the Uncle Kracker song popped up on
sonicnet.  Song is "Follow Me" and the album is Double Wide.  Classy,
classy.

Have a great week and hope to catch up soon!
MR
