          > > break from the slots for dinner with her husband in
          > > the hotel dining room.  But first she wanted to stash
          > > the quarters in her room.
          > >"I'll be right back and we'll go eat," she told her
          husband
          > >and she carried the coin-laden bucket to the elevator.
          > >
          > > As she was about to walk into the elevator she
          > >noticed two men already aboard.  Both were black.
          > >One of them was big ... very big ...an intimidating
          > >figure.  The woman froze.  Her first thought was:
          > >These two are going to rob me.
          > >Her next thought was:
          > >Don't be a bigot, they look like perfectly nice
          gentlemen.
          > >
          > >But racial stereotypes are powerful, and fear immobilized
          her.
          > >She stood and stared at the two men.
          > >She felt anxious, flustered, and ashamed.
          > >
          > >She hoped they didn't read her mind, but knew they
          > >surely did; her hesitation about joining them on the
          > >elevator was all too obvious.  Her face was flushed.
          > >She couldn't just stand there, so with a mighty effort of
          will
          > >she picked up one foot and stepped forward and followed
          > >with the other foot and was on the elevator.
          > >
          > >Avoiding eye contact, she turned around stiffly and
          > >faced the elevator doors as they closed.  A second
          > >passed, and then another second, and then another.
          > >Her fear increased The elevator didn't move.  Panic
          > >consumed her.  My God, she thought, I'm trapped and
          > >about to be robbed.  Her heart plummeted.
          > >Perspiration  poured from every pore.  Then ... one
          > >of the men said, "Hit the floor."
          > >Instinct told her: Do what they tell you.
          > >
          > >The bucket of quarters flew upwards as she
          > >threw out her arms and collapsed
          > >on the elevator carpet.
          > >
          > > A shower of coins rained down on her.  Take my money
          > >and spare me, she prayed.  More seconds passed.

          > >you'll just tell us what floor you're going to,
          > >we'll push the button.'  The one who said it had a

          > >mightily to hold in a belly laugh.
          > >
          > >She lifted her head and looked up at the two men.
          > >They reached down to help her up.
