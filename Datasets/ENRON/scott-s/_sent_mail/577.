Mine:
       For September 28: An agreement or legal matter improves today. You are
                     able to reach an understanding in a previously tense 
affair. Do your best to
                     maintain peace and tranquility, instead of giving into 
resentment or suspicion.
                     Behind the scenes finagling will be required to keep 
others on track and out of
                     trouble. Batten down the hatches during late afternoon 
and evening, and don't
                     let any important info get into the wrong hands. Someone 
may place their trust
                     or future in your custody. Make them glad they did.

His:
      For September 28: Something you already own or have access to provides
                     even more satisfaction and enrichment. Take advantage of 
this opportunity.
                     Squeeze every drop of juice out of a cosmic orange. You 
never lost this
                     chance, but may have temporarily misplaced it. You could 
be sitting on a virgin
                     diamond mine. Dig a little deeper. Later today, you and 
a partner or advisor
                     may clash. Don't slam the door on existing 
relationships, no matter how trying
                     things get. FYI: No bridges should be burnt today.
