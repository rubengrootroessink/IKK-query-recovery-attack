Here's what I propose to send to the parties on the 14th.  Take a look, and 
think about whether it would be wise to do more selling in the first 
paragraph.  I propose that we get on the agenda for the March 1 meeting so 
that we have some time to approach individual parties first.  

With your permission, I will forward this to Mr. Dasovich also.
