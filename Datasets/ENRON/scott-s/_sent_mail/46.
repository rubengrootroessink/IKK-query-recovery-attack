Demetrius, what I nice e-mail!  It was great to see you too.  Unfortunately I 
have a really busy short week this week; we are trying to get something filed 
at FERC.  If you're in town next week do give me a call or e-mail.  I hope 
you have a happy Thanksgiving!

 Susan:
 What a nice surprise seeing you the other evening in Houston. You look 
wonderful and it appears that life is agreeing with you. As we briefly 
discussed, I'm in the Firm's Houston office almost weekly working on client 
matters and client development. It would be great to catch-up with you and 
take you to lunch or to have a cocktail sometime soon. I'm in Houston on 
Monday and Tuesday of this week (11/ 20 &21). Are you around/available? Let 
me know.

         Best regards,
         Demetrius
