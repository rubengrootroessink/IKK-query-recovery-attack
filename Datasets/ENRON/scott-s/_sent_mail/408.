As it appears I will be living and breathing the 32nd floor of the Enron 
building well through the first of the year, I've decided to break down and 
try to maintain my friendships via email.  You all know me well enough to 
know that this a huge step on my part ( I am not the world's best emailer).  
Anyway, I feel like I'm out of touch with what's going on in your collective 
lives and am thus missing out on some pretty wonderful, exciting and special 
things.  So when and if any of you get a chance shoot me back a quick note 
and let me know what's new in your life.

Love you guys,
Susan

Jennifer - Hope work is going well.  I know this time of year has got to be 
crazy for anyone in your line of work, but I'm sure you're handling it well.  
We really need to go grab coffee, dinner, a movie or something soon.  I'm in 
need of a good chat.

Jessica - I know you're in the midst of finals right now and probably about 
to pull your hair out.  Just focus on the fact that they'll be over soon and 
you'll be off to London to see Ashley and Lee ( I am so jealous).  Please 
tell Clay I say hello and wish him good luck as well on y'alls exams.

Lisa - Hey sweetie!  I am so sorry I couldn't make it to your shower in SA, 
but Jen said it went really well.  We need to get together soon I've missed 
seeing you and especially hearing about the wedding and all the fun goings 
ons in your life.  Tell Brad I say "Hi" and I'll be glued to the TV set just 
like him on the on the 29th rooting on the Horns.

Emily - I really want to hear how your Thanksgiving went with Thomas and the 
"Fam".  Knowing Thomas it went great and your entire family (especially your 
Mom) is absolutely in love with him.  Keep me posted on your plans for the 
future ( I'm curious where you're going to end up geographically).  Also, I 
thought you'd find it interesting that I may have an opportunity to work in 
your old hometown - Chicago.  Any thoughts?

Elizabeth - I have really been out of touch with you and I am very mad at 
myself for letting that happen.  Please write back soon and let me know how 
school, your family and this new man in your life ( okay, I'm not completely 
out of touch) are all doing.  My guess is you're going through exams as well 
right now so I'll wish you the best of luck and infinite success.
