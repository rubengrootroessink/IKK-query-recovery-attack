I'm dialling in from home -- got the bug that's going around the office.  
I'll call you in a few...

Frazier tells me he's available.  How about 11:45 at Little Pappasito's on 
Kirby @ Richmond?

Date, time, and either of those places are fine with me, subject to
Frazier's availability.  This would be a good opportunity to discuss topics
for the luncheons, which Frazier and I have been trying to do for a while.
I also need to share with you some conversations I've been having with folks
at EBA in DC and proposals they are pushing at the Houston chapter.

Oooh, "venue." I like it.  The 24th is good with me.  How about either
Pappadeaux or Pappasito or anything else around the Kirby/59 area?  Should
take you guys the same amount of time getting out of downtown.   11:30? (to
beat the lunch crowd).

I am free for lunch on 12/4.  I'll see if Frazier's available.
Why don't we choose a venue somewhere between Duke and downtown.

Sounds like an excellent idea.  Does lunch on Monday, December 4th work for
your schedules?  If not, let's hear a counter-offer.

Susan,

I go this email as well.  Unfortunately, I've been busy as well and didn't
really look at it.  As for future matters, what will be our involvement for
EBA-Houston events?  Would the two of you like to get together for lunch
sometime, maybe with Frazier and the other current EBA officers so we can
understand our roles/duties/functions a little better (hey, aren't we both
pretty big clients of a certain Houston law firm? -- hint, hint, Charles  :
)

Does anyone know this person or his organization?  Is this something our
membership might be interested in?  Frankly I have been too busy to think
about this -- if you have any comments let's talk.

Subject:  24th IAEE International Conference




About three weeks ago, I inquired about EBA's  interest in organizing a
concurrent session at the upcoming IAEE (International  Association for
Energy Economics) conference in Houston (April  2001).

Since I did not hear back from you, I assume that  EBA was not interested.
It would help us a lot in our future planning  if you could perhaps help me
with your reasoning.  Did we approach you  too late (given the Dec 4
deadline)?   We required all participants to pay registration fees, was
that an issue?   We couldn't guarantee you a slot even if you proposed a
session, was that an  issue?

Thanks in advance for your response.
