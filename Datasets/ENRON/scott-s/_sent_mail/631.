You crack me up...I absolutely loved the trading analogy (at times your 
insight is frighteningly dead on).  

Don't worry about me though.  I will be patient and remain optimistic, 
despite let downs.  And, in no way, shape or form will I settle and end up 
with some dush.  You would have been proud of me though, for the first time I 
was really able to let down a lot of those walls and be a little more 
vulnerable.  

I'm thrilled things are going so well with Shannon.  I think your attitude 
about the whole situation is extremely healthy and mature (it amazing what 
happens when you care more about the other person than yourself). 

Talk to you soon,

Susan
