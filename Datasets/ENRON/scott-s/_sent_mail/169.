No probola!  It will be good to have an excuse to go to NM.  Maybe I will go 
this weekend.

So glad you had rain over the weekend!  We did too, and we had had a dry 
spell for almost as long.  I hope it was not too late to save my back yard, 
which was starting to smell like cooked grass.

Bill and I are on the outs.  He just will not do what he needs to in order to 
make things work, so I have given up.  Of course now he is trying to be 
charming.  Anyway, I will have to tell you the whole story some other time.

The kiddies are going back to school already so now would be a good time to 
plan a trip to D.C. at last.  Maybe early Sept?
Also I'd be game for a girls' trip to Destin.

Time to work!
Love,
Sooz

Hi, Sooz,

Don't make a special trip, but the next time you're at the Galleria, would
you go by the Neiman's Clientele make-up counter (by the candy) and get
something for me?  Clientele Wrinkle Treatment.  It'll be pricy, but just let
me know and I'll get a check to you.
love, mum
