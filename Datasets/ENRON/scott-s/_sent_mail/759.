" To dream anything that you want to dream -
      that is the beauty of the human mind.

     To do anything you want to do -
     that is the strength of the human will.

     To trust yourself to test your limits -
      that is the courage to succeed."


" Embrace hard things and your mind will blossom."



"This is America ENRON. We can do anything here." -- Ted Turner   Sunil Dalal


"Finish each day and be done with it. You have done what you could; some 
blunders and absurdities have crept in; forget them
 as soon as you can. Tomorrow is a new day; you shall begin it serenely and 
with too high a spirit to be encumbered with your
 old nonsense."  -Ralph Waldo Emerson


"To laugh often and much; to win the respect of intelligent people and the 
affection of children; to earn the appreciation of
 honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends; to appreciate 
beauty, to find the best in others; to leave the world a little
 better; whether by a healthy child, a garden patch or a redeemed social 
condition; to know even one life has breathed easier
 because you have lived. This is the meaning of success."   -Ralph Waldo 
Emerson
