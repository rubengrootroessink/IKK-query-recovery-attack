I was walking with the trader I work for when you called, so it was obviously a little difficult for me to discuss Vegas at the time.  If you get a hankering to talk in the morning you can try me on my cell phone ( midnight - 2 am isn't too late for me, which I think is between 6-8 am your time, right?).  I know this is obnoxious, but I can't talk to Lisa about this and I need a co-conspirator.
