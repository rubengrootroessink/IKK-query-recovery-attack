Just so you know, I spoke with the group this morning about contracting 
practices and they agreed to do the Christine/Susan/dealmaker huddle prior to 
sending any contracts out.  It helps that I have Kevin's support on this.  I 
think it will work fine.

TK is going make sure Tenaska gets credited.  The difference between actual 
and billed amounts is very little.

Thanks for your attention to this last week.
