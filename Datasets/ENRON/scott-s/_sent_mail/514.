I don't want to stop being nice, but I think it gets me into trouble.

I really miss football--I'm jealous for that.  Is is pass mustard or muster?  
You're right--tough cookie, who deserves a good man.  I'll screen for you.  
20 questions on short call as needed (provided that the info from friends 
thing didn't apply to me....).  Actually I was just developing a social 
circle there and whammo....I'm here.  I figure I'm here to kick some tail and 
worry about the social element later.  Don't get me wrong, I am drinking on 
the w/e's.  Unfortunately I am not meeting the TX & CA women type.  I got no 
Euro-rap....

Been talking to Wilson?  I have been AOL-IMing him.  He seems okay as 
usual--women the same, work on the up with a new boss.  That's all for now.  
Getting sick.  Think I will go home early tonight (relative).  Talk to you 
soon!
