Steve, apparently I'm developing an overactive imagination when it comes to 
FERC decisions.

In Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company, 74 FERC ? 61,102, reh'g denied, 75 
FERC ? 61,272 (1996), and Transwestern, 90 FERC P 61,044, in which FERC 
approved LFT services, the Commission accepted the pipelines' statements that 
they would not sell capacity that is not available (i.e., will not 
double-sell), rather than limit the service in some way or reject the filings.

In Iroquois Gas Transmission System, L.P., 79 FERC ? 61,394 (1997), the 
Commission approved of the pipeline's selling of capacity that becomes 
operationally available for various reasons from time to time.

But I have not been able to locate the general statement along the lines of 
"pipelines can use their own discretion to determine whether capacity is 
available" that I thought existed.
