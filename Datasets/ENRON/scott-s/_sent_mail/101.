Subject: tw interconnect agreement


Susan,

I would like to request 1 final change to the interconnect agreement before
execution.  It is a simple change to better clarify the intent of paragraph
3.4

This is how I would like to see it read,

3.4 For a period of two (2) years from the date of the Facilities are
completed and placed in-service, EPFS shall be obligated to
 deliver an average of  12,500 MMBtu/d to TW at the Interconnect
Point.  At the completion of the second year from the date
 the facilities are completed and placed in service, If EPFS has not
met the 9.1 Bcf volume  commitment, EPFS will refund
 $100,000 to TW within thirty (30) days.  At any time during the two
(2) year period should EPFS's cumulative delivery to TW
 at the Inteconnect Point meet or exceed the 9.1 Bcf commitment, EPFS
is relieved  of its volumetric and monetary obligation
 to TW as described in this paragragh 3.4.  .......  rest as
originally writen...


Please let me know what you think.

Darin
