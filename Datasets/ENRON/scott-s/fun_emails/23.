1.   Question: If you could live forever, would you and why?
Answer:  "I would not live forever, because we should not live
forever, because if we were supposed to live forever, then we would live
forever, but we cannot live forever,  which is why I would not live
forever."
---Miss Alabama in the 1994 Miss USA contest
2.   "Whenever I watch TV and see those poor starving kids all over the
world, I can't help but cry. I mean I'd love to be skinny like that but
not
with all those flies and death and stuff."
---Mariah Carey
3.   "Researchers have discovered that chocolate produces some of the
same
reactions in the brain as marijuana.  The researchers also discovered
other
similarities between the two, but can't remember what they are."
---Matt Lauer on NBC's Today Show, August 22
4.   "I haven't committed a crime. What I did was fail to comply with the 
law."
---David Dinkins, New York City Mayor,
answering accusations that he failed to pay his taxes.

5.   "Smoking kills. If you're killed, you've lost a very important part of 
your
life."
---Brooke Shields, during an interview to become spokesperson for a
federal antismoking campaign.
6.   "I've never had major knee surgery on any other part of my body."
---Winston Bennett, Univ. of KY basketball forward
7.   "Outside of the killings, Washington has one of the lowest crime rates in
the country."
---Mayor Marion Barry, Washington, DC
8.   "We're going to turn this team around 360 degrees."
---Jason Kidd, upon his drafting to the Dallas Mavericks
9.   "I'm not going to have some reporters pawing through our papers.
We
are the president."
---Hillary Clinton commenting on the release of subpoenaed documents.
10.  "China is a big country, inhabited by many Chinese."
---Former French President Charles De Gaulle
11.  "That lowdown scoundrel deserves to be kicked to death by a jackass, and
I'm just the one to do it."
---A Congressional Candidate in Texas
12.  "It isn't pollution that's harming the environment. It's the
impurities in our air and water that are doing it."
---Former U. S. Vice-president Dan Quayle
13.  "Without censorship, things can get terribly confused in the public
mind."
---General William Westmoreland
And last but not least-a parting word from Dan Quayle:
14.  "I love California.  I practically grew up in Phoenix."
