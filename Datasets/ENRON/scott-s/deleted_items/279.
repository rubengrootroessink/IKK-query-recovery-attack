psychobabble (SIE-ko-bab-uhl) noun

   Language laden with jargon from psychotherapy or psychiatry used
   without much concern for accuracy.

[Coined by journalist Richard Dean Rosen (1949- ). From Greek combining
form psycho- (mind) + babble (drivel, blather)].

Here is how Rosen describes the term in his 1997 book "Psychobabble: Fast
Talk and Quick Cure in the Era of Feeling" :

"Psychobabble is ... a set of repetitive verbal formalities that kills off
the very spontaneity, candor, and understanding it pretends to promote. It's
an idiom that reduces psychological insight to a collection of standardized
observations, that provides a frozen lexicon to deal with an infinite
variety of problems."

   "Only a few missteps jar the play's dreamy atmosphere. Unable to resist
   knee-jerk references to Freud and Jung, Ms. Zimmerman has her actors
   spout some psychobabble about myths as public dreams, dreams as private
   myths, and the like."
   Amy Gamerman, Theater: A Timely Gift of Timeless Ovid, The Wall Street
   Journal (New York), Oct 10, 2001.
