Reykjavik, Iceland
Mar 23, 2002
Departures: Mar. 20, 21 & 22, 2002

More than a pageant, the Miss Iceland.is event is a beauty contest with attitude! Every March Iceland's most charismatic and gorgeous young women compete in a high energy beauty pageant.  Each hopes to prove she has what it takes to be Miss Iceland.is. - the beautiful, multi-talented and well-spoken symbol of modern Icelandic women.

You will see some of Iceland's most amazing women, but you will also enjoy a showcase of edgy, free spirited fashion and entertainment as only Iceland can create.

The third Miss Iceland.is pageant will take place the evening of Mar. 23, 2002 at the new NASA club in downtown Reykjavik.

Unlike other beauty contests, Miss Iceland.is is not chosen by a panel of judges.  The Icelandic public chooses the winner by telephone and Internet votes.  The winner will be crowned by an international celebrity guest of honor.  (Past guests of honor have included Claudia Schiffer and Bob Geldoff).
