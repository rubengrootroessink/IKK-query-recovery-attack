invite you, your co-workers and your friends to

Fine Arts Friday
The Professional's Happy Hour

Featuring DJ Andy "Champa" Moore (TLP), heard around town at Hyperia,
Ricebar, and The Davenport.

Also, view The Living Edge:  Richard Pousette-Dart, Works on Paper, the
first exhibition devoted exclusively to the artist's activities as a
draftsman.  One of the youngest Abstract Expressionists, Pousette-Dart was
also one of the most individualistic.  This exhibition of 132 drawings
covers his entire career, including a recently discovered cache of early
works that even his widow had never seen.
