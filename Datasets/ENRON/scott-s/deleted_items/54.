Sue,

this is an inconvenience but just realized that i never filled out a
change of address for our apartment. if you get a chance could you
please fill one out for me. i would ask my mom but it has to come
from our post office off of W. Alabama.

8218 Devonwood
Houston, TX 77070

Thanks,
Lisa

Heard you have an interview in Seattle this weekend. Good luck
and let me know how it goes.
