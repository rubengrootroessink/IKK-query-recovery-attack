*Last Minute Travel-Save up to 60%! 
Dear priceline customer, 
When it comes to flying, planning ahead is harder than it's 
ever been. And if you've traveled at the last minute  before, you 
know airfares are at their highest the closer you get to your 
departure date. 
So what do you do if you have to plan a trip on short notice or 
even the same day? Come to priceline and Name Your Own Price . 
You can save as much as 60%  over the lowest fares you can find 
-- it's one of the few times when waiting until the last minute 
can actually pay off!
