Museum of Fine Arts, February 2, 2002

Packets:			Race packets are in for those that were part of the team registration and they may be picked up at EB4845.
Pre-Race Photo:	We will be meeting at the Start for a group photo at 7:30.  Look for me and a few others in our Enron shirts or look for the Enron flag. 
Post-Race Party:	We'll be congregating around the Enron flag, devouring boxes of Krispy Kremes, ice cream sandwiches
					guzzling beer and listening to great live music.  Hope to see you there!

Best of luck to everyone at the race!
