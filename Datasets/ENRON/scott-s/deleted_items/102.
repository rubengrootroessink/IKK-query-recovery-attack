sticky wicket (STIK-ee WIK-it) noun

[From cricket, when the ground is partly wet, resulting in the ball

   "British Prime Minister Tony Blair, maneuvering his way through the

   an international coalition."
   William Safire, Fog of War: Von Clausewitz Strikes Again, The New York
   Times Magazine, Nov 18, 2001.

someone to "be a sport" or when we chatter about the economy, saying
that it's not dead "by a long shot".

football, baseball, and other games and sports, that are used in real
life as well.                                                     -Anu
