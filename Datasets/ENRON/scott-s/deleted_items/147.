condottiere (kon-duh-TYAR-ee, -ay) noun, plural condottieri

   A hired soldier; mercenary.

[From Italian condottiere, a leader of a group of mercenaries who sold
their services to warring states during 14-16th centuries. From Italian,
from condotta (conduct).]

   "Plenty of states are willing to supply condotierre for the Saudis."
   Y. Sadowski, Revolution, Reform, or Regression?, Brookings Review
   (Washington, DC), Winter 90/91.

   "If any doubts remained about Pakistan's covert support for the
   insurgents, they have now been dispelled: Mere condottieri, dependent
   on their own resources, could not possibly have mounted this
   well-orchestrated military assault."
   Sumit Ganguly, On the Brink in Kashmir, The Nation (New York),
   Jul 19, 1999.
