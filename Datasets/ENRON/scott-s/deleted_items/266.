pocket veto (POK-it VEE-toh) noun

   An indirect veto of a bill as a result of the president's failure to sign
   it within ten days of the adjournment of Congress; a similar holding of
   a bill by a state governor or other executive.

[From the notion that the bill is held in the pocket unsigned. From Latin
veto (I forbid).]

   "President Clinton blocked a similar bill from becoming law with
   a pocket veto last December."
   Jake Lewis, Bankrupt Policies, Multinational Monitor (Washington),
   May 2001.
