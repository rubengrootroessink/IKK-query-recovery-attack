seltzer (SELT-suhr) noun

   1. Naturally effervescent mineral water.

   2. Artificially carbonated water.

[From German Selterser (literally, from Selters), after Selters, a village
near Wiesbaden in Germany where such springs were discovered.]

   "The Randolphs, who live in Towson, also made ginger ale with fresh
   ginger, seltzer and sugar water. `It may not have been the most nutritious
   [drink],' but, `just getting them involved with the whole process' was the
   most important part of the project, says Randolph, a registered dietitian
   at the Urban Medical Institute in Baltimore."
   Stephanie Shapiro, Food-smart, The Sun (Baltimore), Sep 19, 2001.
