   "And it could, at long last, rattle Gibraltar. After all, it's only made
   of clay."
   John Carman, Rivals Chip Away At NBC's Gibraltar / Thursday Night Lineup
   Isn't What it Used to Be, The San Francisco Chronicle, Oct 12, 2000.

   "In this Gibraltar of propriety mediocrity gets intrenched, and
   consolidated, and founded in adamant. An Englishman of fashion is like
   one of those souvenirs, bound in gold vellum, enriched with delicate
   engravings, on thick hot-pressed paper, fit for the hands of ladies and
   princes, but with nothing in it worth reading or remembering."
   Ralph Waldo Emerson, English Traits, 1856.
