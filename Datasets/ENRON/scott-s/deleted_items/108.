hangdog (HANG-dog) adjective

   1. Defeated; dejected

   2. Shamefaced.

[From the notion that the said person deserved to be hanged like a dog.
Yes, not too long ago, dogs were hanged for crimes, such as biting.]

   "Outplacement experts offer these three pieces of advice to holiday job
   seekers. First, don't stand around the chip dip looking hangdog; someone
   with a positive self-image makes a much better impression on potential
   employers. Second, don't come right out and ask for a job; use the parties
   to arrange future meetings with friends or new acquaintances. Third, don't
   drink so much that you start crying in your suds."
   Karen Slater, Firm Touts a New Holiday Bonus: Pink Slips Right Before
   Christmas, The Wall Street Journal (New York), Nov 23, 1984.
