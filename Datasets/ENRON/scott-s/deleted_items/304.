MR. MAXIMILER: Our column from ~OneTravel.com's~ own Frugalist, Bob Jones,
features up-to the-minute tips and deals that maximize your air miles and save
you travel cash.  Read on for this week's "Mr. Maximiler" tip!

Time to plan your spring break is now!

Ah, "spring break."  The memories that simple two-word phrase conjures up.
Seaside, Oregon...  March 1964...I wonder if they still have that warrant out
for me?  Oh well?

This Monday, United hit the streets with another sale, a zone sale.  That means
they have based fares on distance flown.  It took about 1.5 femtoseconds for
the rest of the industry to match United in the continuing saga of the sales.
Fares range from $98, plus the ubiquitous taxes and fees, for a trip from Los
Angeles to San Jose to $398 from New York to Seattle.  The usual black out
dates apply and purchases must be made by the 13th of February.  These fares
are good for travel until May 23.  Here is a Psssssst...A quick check of routes
for the same days on http://www.farebeater.com found as good or better fares on
identical routes or comparable routes using alternate airports.

Now, for you "X-geners," AirTran is back in the X-fares swing with their "one
price fits all segments."  To get the $52 per segment fare, you should arrive
at the airport early and get on the standby list.  Now folks before you all
jump me, this is one of the very few standby fares in existence.  They are not
available for the general public.  So for those of you between 18 and 22, this
is a way to save some of your spring break money for next term's tuition...NOT!
 Travel between now and June 30, 2002.  Remember this is standby so allow
plenty of time on each end.  Don't show up at the airport June 30th for the
last flight and expect to get on it.

My pick of the litter is a Eurail SelectPass 5-day saver pass for $199, a
savings of over 30%.  This pass allows two or more people, traveling together,
first class rail travel on any five days in a two-month period. If you plan
your three "adjoining" countries properly, you can fly into Italy and visit all
of France, Italy and Greece.  Get to Greece using the free or discounted bonus
of the pass, a ferry trip from Brindisi, Italy to Patris, Greece.  From Patris,
it is an interesting trip to Athens and beyond.  The interesting part is that
this railroad is narrow gauge.  Don't try to drink from a full cup on this
route; you will spill!  Visit
http://onetravel.railkey.com/onetravel/specials.asp and click on Eurail Saver
Selectpass

See you on a flight, or train, soon,

Bob
