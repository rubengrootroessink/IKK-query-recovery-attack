hotsy-totsy (HOT-see TOT-see) adjective, also hotsie-totsie

   Just right; perfect.

[Coined by Billy De Beck, cartoonist (1892-1942), famed for his comic
strip "Barney Google and Snuffy Smith". Another of his coinage that has
found a place in the English language dictionaries is heebie-jeebies
meaning jitters or creeps (See AWAD archives, August 1997).]

   "(Billy Bob) Thornton has played unfathomable, soulful characters
   before. He was the ace air traffic controller in Pushing Tin, who
   baffles his colleagues by getting the hotsy-totsy girl."
   Stuart Jeffries, A Movie About a Barber Who Wants to Be a Dry Cleaner?
   The Guardian (London), May 14, 2001.
