Nancy emailed me about a restaurant that I have not heard of called "The
Daily Review" - I looked it up on citysearch and it sounds really good!

Here is the reivew:

We could either go there this month or we could cook this month (the recipe exchange) and save it for February.  What do you think?

Also, are we still thinking that Monday nights are the best?  They definitely are the best for me, provided that we do not have NCL.  Is everyone free
 on Jan 14, Jan 21?
