SMART TRAVELERS' CORNER: This week, columnist Bob Jones provides tips on getting the best travel deal.

TRAVEL 101, LESSON FOUR - Planning

Sometime between Christmas and New Years, I determine where and approximately when I want to travel during the coming year.  I have two recurring annual trips that are pretty much in stone, but the remaining travels are based on what I think will be good values and opportunities in the coming year.

The destinations selected are generic.  That is, I will look at locations with similar attributes for a general time frame and not lock myself into a specific place.  As an example, Costa del Sol in southern Spain is lovely in late winter, and even though Morocco is located in Africa, it has a similar climate and may even undercut European prices. So while I plan a geographical area, I remain flexible in the exact location.

Regional "destination" selected, it is time to begin watching for specials.  These specials happen very quickly and require some effort to ensure availability.  The initial activity is to simply inform your travel agent, if you use one, of your general requirements and let them do the searching for you.  Tell them your travel window, general location and your budget limit. It is also important to advise them if your total budget includes meals. An all-inclusive package at Club Med may be just as good a deal or better than an "on your own" package where you choose the chow.

If you are planning trips on your own, via the Internet, identify sites like 11th Hour Vacations (http://www.11thhourvacations.com) to begin your search.  Be sure to check back often as this site specializes in last minute deals that come and go quickly.  Check the major carriers themselves as they offer vacation packages at extremely good prices.  Prices overall will remain low for some time as providers work hard to get folks back into the travel mode.  Airlines, cruise lines, hotels and other industry components are working hard to fill seats, berths and beds.  Even now, most travel sales extend well into the spring of 2002, which is a definite asset in planning. Keep your eyes open and you too can have a very affordable vacation this year!

See you on a flight soon,


Bob
