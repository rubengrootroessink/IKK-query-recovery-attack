Hello again to everyone!

I wanted to send out a reminder e-mail regarding our philanthropy event on
February 20th.  We will be creating care packages for KIPP Academy students
who are in boarding school.  Many of these kids have never been away from
home - so we create small study packs filled with snacks, supplies and notes
to encourage them.  Originally we were planning on holding this event at
KIPP Academy however we were able to get a room at St. Luke's church.
Please meet at St. Luke's at 7:00 p.m. on February 20th in room R25.  If you
have any quote books or inspiration books - please bring those along as well
to help with the notes.  If you have any questions, please don't hesistate
to send me an e-mail.

See you on Wednesday!
Ashley

- St. Luke's is located on the corner of Edloe and Westheimer.  Edloe is
just west of Kirby.
- For more info on KIPP - please see www.kipp.org
