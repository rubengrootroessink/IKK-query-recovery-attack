apodictic (ap-uh-DIK-tik) adjective, also apodeictic

   Demonstrably true.

[From Latin apodicticus, from Greek apodeiktikos, from apodeiknynai (to
demonstrate), from apo- + deiknynai (to show).]

   "The very best philosophy is apodictic. It proceeds slowly, carefully,
   skeptically, via demonstration and argument, until suddenly something
   new comes to light."
   Peter Marin, Good Will Hunting; Existentialists and Mystics,
   The Los Angeles Times, Apr 12, 1998.
