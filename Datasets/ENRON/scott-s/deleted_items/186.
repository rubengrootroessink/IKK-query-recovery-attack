MR. MAXIMILER: Our column from ~OneTravel.com's~ own Frugalist, Bob Jones,
features up-to the-minute tips and deals that maximize your air miles and save
you travel cash.  Read on for this week's "Mr. Maximiler" tip!

Here is our list of February Fantastics!

AIRLINES

While the never-ending sales continue, here is an offer a bit out of the
ordinary.  From Icelandair, we have an "Eat, Drink and be Merry in Iceland"
promotion.  The festival, which runs from February 27, through March 4,
includes gourmet dining, a National Beer Day, Mystery Basket Food, and Fun
Cooking Competition.  Packages are priced from $579, per person/double
occupancy, plus taxes and fees, and include round-trip airfare, three night's
hotel, transfers, and breakfast (except day of arrival).  You also receive
admission to a kick-off party, gourmet dinner at participating restaurants,
admission to the mystery basket cook-off, admission to the Gala Dinner on March
3, and transportation to some venues.  Extra nights and add-on tours are
available.  Call 800-779-2899 for details.

Delta has jumped on the discount award bandwagon.  For 20,000 miles, you can
fly anywhere in the continental U.S. in coach or for 15,000 more, find out what
really goes on between the curtains and cockpit door!  Travel must be completed
by March 20, 2002.  Visit
http://www.delta.com/skymiles/member_guide/delta_awards/promo_awd/index.jsp.
Remember too that with Delta, there is no Saturday night stay requirement.

HOTELS

Borrowing a page from the airlines, "pay with cash and miles" book, Starwood is
offering a rate that combines points and cash for rooms.  The offer is good at
virtually all properties in the system and depending on the hotel category,
award nights can be purchased with a combination of either 2,800 Starpoints and
$45 USD per night or 4,000 Starpoints and $60 USD per night. Participating
hotels outside the U.S. feature the same Starpoint values combined with the
local currency equivalent of either $45 USD or $60 USD at time of reservation.
For details, visit:
http://www.starwood.com/preferredguest/starpoints/cash_points_landing.html

OTHERS

Two weeks ago, I mentioned ways to save in the cities you visit.  The way that
visitor and convention bureaus are working with local restaurants and hotels
has been punctuated by New York's "Paint the Town Red, White and Blue"
promotion.  Here you will find three course lunches for $20 or less and full
course dinners for about $30.  You will also find ways to save on Broadway
shows and transportation.  Wow, what a deal!  Visit http://www.nycvisit.com for
complete details and your discount card to be used with your AmEx card.

See you on a flight soon,

Bob
