MR. MAXIMILER: Our column from ~OneTravel.com's~ own Frugalist, Bob Jones,
features up-to the-minute tips and deals that maximize your air miles and save
you travel cash.  Read on for this week's "Mr. Maximiler" tip!

Okay, you've got the deal of the year on airfare, so now what?

You have been watching the sales and have managed to pick up round trip tickets
from your hometown to Palm Beach, Florida for under $200. Tickets in hand, it's
time to fill in the gap between your PBI arrival and departure.  Let's see now,
you will need a rental car, a hotel room, some entertainment or activities and
meals, to go along with vegging on the beach during your stay.  Here are some
quick ways to stretch your bucks.

The car part is easy, pick your favorite and book it.  Keep an eye on coupons
you may have and remember that some could cost you more than the negotiated
rates on carwiz.com.  When you arrive at the airport, look for signs that say
"Cars Available" and ask for an upgrade or better rate.

A quick trip to http://ehotel.onetravel.com will show available hotels in West
Palm Beach.  Interested in one on the beach?  Click on the "Location Map"
button to get the properties' proximity to the beach and highways.  For
entertainment, visit http://palmbeaches.com/attrac/index.html for attractions
and activities.

The meals part of the trip can make or break your whole getaway!  How about a
list of restaurants from which to choose prior to arrival AND a 20% discount on
the food portion of your bill?  There are lots of ways to save using various
discount plans but one I find attractive is In Good Taste.  For a limited time,
a free one-year membership is available to those who register via
http://11thhour.igtcard.com/11thhour/home.htm.   The best part of the plan is
that it is not limited to dining.  The IGT card is also good for dinner
cruises, dry cleaning and discounts to attractions and more.  It just might
become one of your most important travel cards as you discover what it can do
for you.

Finally, if Palm Beach is not in your plans, my pick of the week has to be this
alternative vacation:  http://www.icelandair.com/missiceland

See you on a flight soon,

Bob
