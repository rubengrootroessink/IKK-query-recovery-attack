SMART TRAVELERS' CORNER: This week, columnist Bob Jones provides tips on getting the best travel deal.

TRAVEL 101, LESSON SEVEN - Travel Clubs, a good idea?

There are several travel clubs now purporting to offer exceptional savings to their members.  The first type offers very low cost or even free airfare if you simply book your hotel with them.  Many have a one week minimum stay requirement and charge rates which far exceed what the smart traveler can find using free online services or a mainline agency for both the cost of air and hotel.  A second membership program says they will save you 50% off published hotel rates.  They will, but that is 50% of the highest rate.  It's easy to find discounts aplenty just using credit cards, AAA, AARP or other memberships.  The third type requires you join just to see the deals.  However, the restrictions, once viewed, may be too many to be of any advantage.  Before I pay, I want the full story, so I want to get full disclosure.  Ask to "visit" "Members Only" areas.  If they will not provide full disclosure or a free tour then remember your Latin...  Caveat Emptor!

Here is a club deal example.  A site is touting New York to European destinations for "Only $249."  Wow! What a deal!  I e-mailed the company to get details and total price.  This site charges a $50 membership fee, but before I pay, I want to make sure that what I see is what I pay.  Problem is that so far, I have not received a reply and, doubt seriously if I will.  Why?  Well, you don't get the total price until you join and unless I am wrong, taxes, customs and immigration fees, security costs and segment taxes are not included in the $249.  Nowhere in the hype on the main page or the description does it mention a thing about taxes or fees other than the fuel and charges that "may" be additional.  So, what are the taxes and fees to Europe from New York?  About $115.  The total cost for this deal?  $249+115+50 (membership fee) = $414.  A good deal?  Sure, if you didn't look at other sites where you will find prices right around $341.  Now, if you travel to Europe more than!
 twice a year, joining might pay off.   But overall, you will probably do better without a membership.  I believe it is better to rely on newsletters such as this and SideStep.com's to really find the deals.

See you on a flight soon,


Bob
