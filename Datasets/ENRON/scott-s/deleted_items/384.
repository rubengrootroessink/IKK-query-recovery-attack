   1. Of or relating to the phallus carried in procession in ancient
      Bacchic festivals.

   2. Indecent or salacious.

[From Late Latin ithyphallicus, from Greek ithyphallikos, from ithyphallos,
from ithys (straight) + phallos (phallus).]

   "Luxor Temple is more comprehensible than the vaster ruins at Karnak.
   It was also dedicated to Amun - but to a different manifestation of
   the same god, associated with fertility and often shown in ithyphallic
   form."
   Ronald Wright, Images Of Egypt; Temples, Tombs and Entrepreneurs,
   The Washington Post, Jun 11, 1989.
