SMART TRAVELERS' CORNER: This week, columnist Bob Jones provides tips on getting the best travel deal.

Spring break for Travel 101 - (We will resume the frugal travel course next week.)

Detroit's new terminal opens. Part Two - The New.  (Continued from last week.  For the complete story, click on link below.

Up at the crack of dawn, I checked in at Indy and spoke with other travelers about the new digs in Detroit.  All had horror stories about the old terminal and one recounted the days prior to the moving walkways when a trip from the ticket counter to the C concourse was indeed 15 minutes for the hale and hearty.  Enough talk about the old terminal, on to the new.

We arrived a little early at Detroit's NWA "World Gate Way" and there was some confusion getting to the gate but I suspect that was just first day jitters as ground controllers learned how to move aircraft in a "corridor" free environment.  The main stream press reported how Richard Anderson, CEO of Northwest, was on hand to greet the first few flights.  He didn't greet ours when it arrived at 9:17 AM, must have seen my name on the manifest.  Our arrival gate A-43 was near the center of the terminal and my connecting flight was out of A-1 literally over a half mile away.  However, the elevated tram that runs the length of the terminal was just a few feet away allowing the journey from A-43 to A-1 to be accomplished in under five minutes.  This alone sold me!

I intentionally planned the trip to allow three hours to really get to know the new facility.  I had been invited on a press tour but knew we would be shown what they wanted us to see and report about...the five Ws of course.  I wanted to see what travelers saw, after all, that's who it was built for, wasn't it?  Remember, my arrival was on a Sunday, an off travel day, but things went very smoothly.  Not all the shops were open but it was easy to see that one could buy just about anything they had forgotten to pack, including a Brooks Brother's suit.  Heck, if you were really late and couldn't pack, you could buy and fill a bag right there!  Restrooms were everywhere.  It was impossible to not see at least two for each gender simultaneously.  Newsstands were every 100 paces and a food court at the north end of the terminal covers you from soup to nuts!  Mid terminal, the main entry and exit point for travelers beginning or ending their journey in Detroit contains a huge wate!
r sculpture.  This should make an ideal meeting place if 5,000 people don't decide to use it all at once.
