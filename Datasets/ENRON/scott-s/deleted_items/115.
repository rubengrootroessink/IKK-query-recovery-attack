Carbo Loading Dinner
Unfortunately, there was not a significant response to a dinner this year, so the ERC we will not be hosting a formal carbo loading.

Marathon Day
Many of us will be meeting marathon morning at the 'E' in the George R. Brown.  I, along with a few others, will see off the marathoners and then make our way down the course to cheer on the runners at Miles 7/8, 23 and the Finish.  If you, your friends or family would like to join us, please e-mail me or leave me a voice mail at (713) 853-4770.

Massages
Attention Marathoners & 1/2 Marathoners!
Good luck to you all on Sunday!  Enjoy every step of the way (that's a LOT of enjoyment coming your way)!
And when all of those steps are behind you, you'll need a massage for your legs of steel.  So, here is the deal I have for you!  A 45-minute massage for $30!  Just contact me at 713-432-6628 or moraap@chevrontexaco.com. I will do my very best to accommodate your schedule requests.  Remember, distance running doesn't build character, IT REVEALS IT!

Happy Hoofing!
Ann Mora, 713-432-6628

Team Roster
I will be submitting a team roster, so if you're running, please provide me your name and age.  Thanks!

I wish the best of luck to all our runners who have dedicated so much of their time and energy training to meet their marathon goals.  I hope everyone runs a strong, injury-free, successful race on Sunday!
We gain strength, and courage, and confidence by each experience . . . we must do that which we think we cannot.
