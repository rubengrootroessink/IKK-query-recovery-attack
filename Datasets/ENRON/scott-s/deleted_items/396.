proscenium (pro-SEE-nee-uhm) noun

   The part of the stage that is in front of the curtain.

[From Latin proscenium, from Green proskenion, from pro- (before) +
skene (scene).]

   "A certain elegant artificiality borders this novel (Gertrude and
   Claudius) like the proscenium of a stage. Updike has laced his own
   Shakespearean aphorisms through the narrative."
   Ron Charles, To Be or Not to Be a Good Parent, That is the Question,
   Christian Science Monitor (Boston), Feb 3, 2000.

This week's theme: words from theater.
