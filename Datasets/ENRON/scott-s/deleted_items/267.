Watergate (WOH-tuhr-gayt) noun

   A scandal involving abuse of office, deceit, and cover-up.

[After Watergate office and residential complex in Washington, DC, the
site of a break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters in
1972 that resulted in the resignation of President Richard Nixon two years
later.]

Watergate, a scandal of mammoth proportions, has given us a useful suffix
for describing a wide variety of subsequent scandals, from monicagate to
enrongate, to the recent icegate or skategate, and hot off the press,
gategate: http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A26164-2002Feb17.html

   "On this (campaign finance reform) bill and other political reforms,
   Congress should give primacy to the rights and needs of voters. Reform
   should not have to wait for a tangled election like the one just
   concluded - or a Watergate."
   A Step Toward Reform, The Boston Globe, Mar 30, 2001.
