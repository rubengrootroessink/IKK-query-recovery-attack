cruciverbalist (kroo-ci-VUHR-buh-list) noun

   A crossword designer or enthusiast.

[From Latin cruci-, stem of crux (cross), + verbalist (one skilled in use
of words), from verbum (word).]

   "In a suburban town in Connecticut, Cora Felton has some small measure
   of notoriety as the Puzzle Lady, reputed constructor of syndicated
   crosswords. The much married and generally alcoholic Cora, though, is
   a front for her niece Sherry, the real cruciverbalist."
