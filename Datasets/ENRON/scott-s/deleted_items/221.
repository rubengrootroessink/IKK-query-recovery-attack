bloviate (BLO-vee-ayt) verb intr.

   To speak pompously.

[Pseudo-Latin alteration of blow, to boast; popularized by 29th US
President, Warren G. Harding (1865-1923).]

   "The Legislature bloviates about protecting our youth and being sure
   that no one is left behind. But at the first sign of trouble, it's
   showing indications that it's more concerned with politics than
   education."
   Backing Off in Albany, The Buffalo News, Nov 8, 1999.
