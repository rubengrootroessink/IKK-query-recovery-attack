This effort is part of American Airlines continuing commitment to the security of our customers.

Once you sign up for Flight Status Notification, we'll notify you of flight arrival or departure times, as well as gate and baggage information - no matter where you are.  You choose when and how you want to be notified, whether it's a voice message to any type of phone, or a text message to a cell phone, alphanumeric pager, wireless personal digital assistant (PDA), or a regular email account.
