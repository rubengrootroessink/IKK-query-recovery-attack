camorra (kuh-MOR-uh) noun

   A secret group united for unscrupulous purposes.

[After Camorra, a secret organization in Naples, Italy, engaged in
criminal activities, mostly during the 19th century. From Italian, possibly
from Spanish (dispute).]

   "Granted, the public's taste in art could be called naive by the elitist
   standards of the camorra of collectors, gallery owners and museum
   curators who control the art world."
   American Pop, The Nation (New York), Mar 14, 1994.

This week's theme: words with Italian connection.
