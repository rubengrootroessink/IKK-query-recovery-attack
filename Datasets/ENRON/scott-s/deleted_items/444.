iracund (IE-ruh-kund) adjective

   Inclined to anger; irascible.

[From Latin iracundus, from ira (anger) + -cundus (inclined toward)].

Can you think of an antonym of today's word that shares the same suffix?

   "One word: iracund. Or perhaps a better choice might be grumpy."
   Campaign Grapevine, The Press Democrat (Santa Rosa, California),
   Oct 21, 1996.

I shall be telling this with a sigh / Somewhere ages and ages hence: / Two
roads diverged in a wood, and I -- / I took the one less traveled by, / And
that has made all the difference. -Robert Frost, poet (1874-1963)
