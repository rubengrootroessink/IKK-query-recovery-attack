ethology (ee-THOL-uh-jee) noun

   The study of animal behavior in their natural environments.

[From French ?thologie, coined by Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, zoologist
(1805-1861).]

   "Field biologists such as Poole and Goodall, who've each spent decades
   studying the behavior of animals in their natural habitats, do not doubt
   that elephants, chimpanzees and other creatures feel intense, humanlike
   emotions - from happiness, sadness and anger to perhaps even love and
   embarrassment... Research by (Marc) Bekoff and others - in fields
   ranging from ethology to neurobiology - is beginning to provide
   scientific support for the notion that animals feel a wide range of
   emotions."
   Laura Tangley, Natural Passions, International Wildlife (Vienna),
