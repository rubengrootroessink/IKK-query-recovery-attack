HOT FARES OF THE WEEK: Fly Reno to Baltimore from $273 or Kansas City to San
Diego from $232!

Fly Reno to Baltimore from $273
Baltimore is well-known for the National Aquarium and the Inner Harbor, but
don't forget about some of the off-beat attractions. Walk the cobblestone
streets of Fells Point, and stroll through the fish markets and interesting
shops. This city is revitalizing the historic waterside areas, attracting an
increasing amount of visitors. And understandably so, Baltimore offers many
nice restaurants, museums, and theatres. You can fly there from $273.

Fly Kansas City to San Diego from $232
Sunshine and warm weather await in San Diego. While it still maintains its
small-town atmosphere, San Diego is completely metropolitan. With its
high-style dining options and nouveaux architecture, San Diego has a booming
tourist industry. Get there from $232.

MR. MAXIMILER: Our column from ~OneTravel.com's~ own Frugalist, Bob Jones,
features up-to the-minute tips and deals that maximize your air miles and save
you travel cash.  Read on for this week's "Mr. Maximiler" tip!

"Oh, East is East and West is West, and the wrong one I have chose?"

Is it possible to make a mistake on foreign travel right now?  Only if you pay
too much!  Here are some ways to save and get you on your way to Asia or Europe
for a song!  See?  There is a tie in.

The first place to look for super travel deals is right on top of the OneTravel
home page in Spotlight Sales.  Here you will find negotiated fares that are
truly unbeatable in their overall value.  The next spot is this newsletter
which contains last minute and weekend specials, again tailored to your
individual location.  Finally, I spend the week turning stones to find deals
that are not generally available to the traveling public and bring them to you.
 Here are those picks this week.

Cathay Pacific and Icelandair have something very unique in common...they both
are based and have their hubs on fairly small islands.  The other thing they
have in common is their commitment to service and fares so good, you can't
afford to stay home!  Cathay is offering their deal of the month that allows
you to travel from New York, Los Angeles or San Francisco to Hong Kong AND
Singapore for $599 plus the usual taxes and fees amounting to another $100 or
so.  The travel window for the deal is May 1 through June 30, 2002, a great
time to visit both these cities.  Full details can be found at
http://www.cathay-usa.com/dotm/dotm.asp

Icelandair offers weekly "Lucky Fares" for travel from several Eastern cities,
and one Midwest city, to Europe.  The sale that ended Tuesday offered Boston or
Baltimore to Paris with a midweek departure and return for $248 plus taxes and
fees.  If Europe is in your plans and you can travel at the last minute, these
may be the sales to watch.  Visit http://www.icelandair.com

See you on a flight soon,

Bob
