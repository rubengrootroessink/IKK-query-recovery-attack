Chevy Trucks Iceland Open
Experience 24 hours of PLAYLIGHT this summer in The Chevy Trucks Iceland Open, Reykjavik, Iceland

If you happen to be from, do business with, or have visited Iceland, then you are keenly aware of the "land of the midnight sun."  For those who may not be as lucky, we're proud to introduce what we feel is a terrific reason to visit Iceland this summer.  Chevrolet and Time4Media, a division of AOL Time Warner, is proud to introduce The Chevy Trucks Iceland Open Adventure.  This June 17th - 23rd (travel dates), in Reykjavik, Iceland, Chevy Trucks and Time4Media will be introducing a unique golfing experience for anyone looking for something a bit more "adventurous."  Not just for the golfing enthusiast, however, The Chevy Trucks Iceland Open Adventure is an event where everyone golfing will be playing through the "midnight sun" in a 36 hole, golf tournament taking place on Iceland's two finest golf courses; the Reykjavik and Keilir Golf Courses.

Chevrolet & Time4Media invite you to revisit Iceland and for those first timers, experience what it is like to:
Play golf where the sun never sets
Visit snow glaciers in the summer's day
Go white water river rafting
Witness huge humpback, blue, killer, and sperm whales
Experience the incredible nightlife of the capital city of Reykjavik
Rejuvenate in the famous Blue Lagoon

The golfing will be competitive but fun and in addition to the two tournament rounds, a practice round precedes each.  Tee times to begin each night at approximately 9:00pm.  The trip includes:
Airfare to/from Reykjavik, Iceland from/to BOS, JFK & BWI via Icelandair.
Visit to the Blue Lagoon
Rental Car for 6 days
Hotel for 5 nights (single and double occupancy available)
4 rounds of golf
Opening and Awards reception dinners

With 24 hours of Playlight, you may need to rest up now.
