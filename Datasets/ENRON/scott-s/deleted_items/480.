Dear Netclub member

The days left to April Fools Day are quickly disappearing, and so are our great offers to Iceland & the USA. Remember if you book online with us now you can win two tickets to the USA with Icelandair. The lucky winner of last month's competition to win your money back was Ms. Cawley, and she is enjoying her free getaway courtesy of Icelandair.

For those of you based in London, look out for our great packages advertised on the Underground, also to be found on our website. Fabulous frolics, Icelandic style are available for all at amazing prices.
