fetor (FEE-tuhr) noun, also foetor

   A strong offensive odor; stench.

[From Latin fetor, from fetere (to stink).]

   "Just imagine yourself trying to pick out fresh fruit while your olfactory
   nerve is bombarded with the fetor of a bait shop run by some flea-bitten
   old coot called Gooey."
   Dell Poncet, Odors, Clinton and Fat, Philadelphia Business Journal,
   Jan 19, 1996.
