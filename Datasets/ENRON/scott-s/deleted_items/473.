Hi,
We are looking forward to seeing you on Friday, but if you get to town early enough on Thursday and want to stop by we would be happy to show you around the office and introduce you to some of the people in the department. Pattie is going to set up your second interview for Friday morning at 10:00 a.m., more introductions and then we can go to lunch.
Iif you need directions to the office or hotel please advise and we will try not to get you lost.
If you have any questions do not hesitate to me at (206) 381-6847.

Steve
