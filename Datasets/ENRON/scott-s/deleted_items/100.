   An obscure, ostentatious, or bookish word, especially one derived from
   Latin or Greek.

[From the fact that such a term is used more in writing than in speech.]

   "The flowery barbarisms of inkhorn terms vanished within years of the
   appearance of her (Hester Lynch Thrale Piozzi's) book ...."
