nitid (NIT-id) adjective

   Bright; shining; glossy.

[From Latin nitidus (shining), from nitere (to shine).]

Etymologically speaking, the word "neat" is a cousin of today's word.

   "The last rays of the sun linger, hanging on to clouds whose bizarre
   formation is never more apparent, while the evening gently settles in,
   erasing the nitid contours of objects and people."
   Celeste Olalquiaga, The Artificial Kingdom: A Treasury of the Kitsch
   Experience, Pantheon Books, 1998.

When one has too great a dread of what is impending, one feels some relief
when the trouble has come. -Joseph Joubert, essayist (1754-1824)
