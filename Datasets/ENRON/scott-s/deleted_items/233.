Dear Netclub member

The booking process for Netclub members has become more user friendly than before and now offers you, our valuable members, even cheaper fares to Iceland and the USA.

We have reduced the number of steps for booking online and our lower promotional fares (Lucky Fares) are available exclusively to Netclub members. So you can be sure that when you book a Lucky Fare with Icelandair, you are receiving our very best offers that are unavailable anywhere else. But the good news just doesn't end there!!

You can now win your money back when you book any flight through the Netclub. All Netclub members who make a booking between now and the end of February will be entered in a draw to win back the price of their flight. So get booking your Lucky Fares and you could be travelling gratis thanks to Icelandair.

What could possibly be better than flying Icelandair?..flying with Icelandair for free, that's what!!!
