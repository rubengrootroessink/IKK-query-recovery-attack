HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!! I had no idea! I'm so glad you told me. Hey, I want to send
you something that I gathered recently. What is your mailing address--don't
worry, it isn't kiddy porn...he he he.
Listen, have a great day and be safe. I will write a more thorough note
tomorrow. I am exhausted....
Best to you!
Tobin
