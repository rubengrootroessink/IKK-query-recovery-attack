winebibber (WYN-bib-uhr) noun

   One who drinks too much wine.

[From Middle English wine + bib (to drink).]

   "For devoted winebibber Thomas Jefferson, who drank the First Growths of
   Bordeaux (Lafite, Latour, Haut-Brion, Margaux) even before they were
   classified as such in 1855, one of his keenest disappointments was the
   failure to establish vineyards at Monticello."
   Barbara Ensrud, Jefferson Would Be Proud, The Wall Street Journal
   (New York), Aug 1, 1997.

I am a Conservative to preserve all that is good in our constitution, a
Radical to remove all that is bad. I seek to preserve property and to
respect order, and I equally decry the appeal to the passions of the many
of the prejudices of the few. -Benjamin Disraeli, British prime minister
(1804-1881)
