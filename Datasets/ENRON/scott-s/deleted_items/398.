buskin (BUS-kin) noun

   1. A thick-soled, laced boot, reaching to knee or calf, worn by actors
      of ancient Greek and Roman tragedies. Also known as cothurnus.

   2. A tragic drama.

[Perhaps from Middle French brousequin.]

Because those big shoes were often worn by tragedians, we came to
refer to a tragedy itself as a buskin. A counterpart of buskin is
sock (a comedy) after soccus, a lightweight low shoe worn by Greek
and Roman comic actors.                                         -Anu

   "`My vein,' wrote Corneille, `often combines the lofty buskin with
   the comic sock, and ... pleases the audience by striking contrasting
   notes.'"
   Linda Winer, Corneille With Kushner's Help, Newsday (New York),
   Jan 20, 1994.
