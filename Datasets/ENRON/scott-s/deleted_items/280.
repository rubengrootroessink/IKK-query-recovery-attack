spaghetti western (spuh-GET-ee WES-tuhrn) noun

   A cheap western movie produced in Italy or Spain, typically having
   Italian actors, an American star, and a generous dose of violence.

[From spaghetti (a pasta from Italy), western (a story/movie with 19th
century US West setting).]

   "Alone at night, she bobbed in a sea of spaghetti Westerns, make-my-day
   police dramas, and goofball comedies."
