Hi guys!

I have been incredibly disorganized about the rsvps for Caycie's party this
weekend - so if you have already sent it in, I am so sorry!

Please email me back and let me know if you will be there for the Friday
night dinner (8:00 - Wimberly) and if you want to get a manicure/peticure
on Saturday.

Thanks!

Love,
Lisa
