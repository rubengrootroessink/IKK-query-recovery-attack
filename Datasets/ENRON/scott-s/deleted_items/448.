2002 ERC Membership
Our Spring season is fast approaching and we have a full calendar of events!  I have attached a tentative ERC program for 2002 and thought this would get us rolling for now.  There have been some temporary changes so please read the files I have attached.

 
Volunteers
I'm looking for volunteers to assist with the restructuring of the Enron Running Club involving assistance with race packet pick up, meeting coordinating, club funding, race directing, etc.  If you have some time you would like to donate to the ERC, please let me know.

Running Gear
I will be looking to clear out our stock of running gear and will use the proceeds to help fund the 2002 ERC.  If you are interested in purchasing ERC items, please let me know.

If you have any questions, please contact me at 713-853-4770 or via e-mail.

Cindy
