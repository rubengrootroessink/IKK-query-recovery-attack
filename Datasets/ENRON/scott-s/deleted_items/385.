ukase (yoo-KAYS, yoo-KAYZ, YOO-kays, YOO-kayz) noun

   An arbitrary proclamation or order; edict.

[After ukaz, a decree issued by a Russian czar having the force of law.
From French, from Russian ukaz (decree), from Old Church Slavonic ukazu
(proof), from ukazati, from u- (at, away) + kazati (to show).]

   "Guardian journalists are to be discouraged from signing petitions,
   speaking at public meetings, joining marches or, heaven forbid, standing
   for parliament, a ukase that would have dramatically affected the
   political ambitions of C P Scott, Morgan Phillips Price, Lena Jeger,
   Martin Linton, Polly Toynbee, Malcolm Dean, Christopher Huhne and,
   indeed, the present writer."
   Richard Gott, The Lost Magic of Manchester, The New Statesman (London),

It was only a dozen years ago (March 14, 1990) that Mikhail Gorbachev was
elected to the presidency of the USSR, but it already seems an eternity,
considering the tremendous changes he unwittingly set off by his efforts
to modernize his regime.

When I was living in Moscow as a correspondent in the early seventies, no
one had the slightest idea that the entire communist edifice could collapse
as rapidly as it did after Gorbachev's well-intentioned tinkerings.

In those days the best brains of the West were expending a vast amount of
imagination (not to mention cold cash) trying to elucidate the mysteries of
the inner circles of power behind the great brick walls of Red Square. The
political science of choice was then known as Kremlinology.

Moscow was the capital city not of what we call Russia today, but of the
USSR -- the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics -- and most of the Russian
language words with which we were familiar were derived from the
Marxist-Leninist "newspeak" which dominated everyday life, and which George
Orwell had caricatured with such devastating accuracy in "Animal Farm" and
"1984."

Over the last dozen years an entirely new vocabulary, reflecting the
realities of the new, semi-democratic state, has consigned the old
political jargon to the dustbin of history. But let us not forget that
long before either of these Ivan-come-lately regimes had appeared on the
world stage, a third set of politico-economic realities had spawned a far
greater culture with its own rich vocabulary for our borrowing -- the
eternal Russia of Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Gogol, Turgenyev, Chekhov and
many others. This sampling of Russian words dips into all three of these
historical periods. -Rudy Chelminski (rudychelminski@aol.com)
