Chautauqua (shuh-TO-kwuh, chuh-) noun

   An annual summer school offering education in the form of public lectures
   and cultural activities, often held outdoors.

[After Chautauqua, the name of a lake and county in southwestern New York
state where such a program originated in 1874.]

   "In this Chautauqua I would like not to cut any new channels of
   consciousness but simply dig deeper into old ones that have become
   silted in with the debris of thoughts grown stale and platitudes too
   often repeated."
   Robert M. Pirsig, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, 1974.

the names of some locations. They are known as toponyms, words derived from
places.

Whether it's when we drink champagne (from Champagne, France), make a
solecism (after Soloi, an Athenian colony in Cilicia), or when we meet our
Waterloo (Waterloo, Belgium) we are (perhaps unknowingly) alluding to a
distant land and its history. This week's words take us to New York, Rome,
Ireland, Germany, and the Mediterranean.                            -Anu
