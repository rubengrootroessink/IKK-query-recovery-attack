The Strongest Link: Aramco Services and Houston

The national oil company of Saudi Arabia, Saudi Aramco, and its
Houston-based subsidiaries Aramco Services Company (ASC) and Saudi Refining,
Inc., play a key role in supplying the energy needs of consumers worldwide.
Their work is vital to the economic health of nations around the globe and
to the welfare of their people. Ahmed Al Arnaout will discuss ASC's
operations and how the company applies its energy to enhance Houston's
quality of life.

Ahmed Al Arnaout heads the North American arm of Saudi Aramco as President
and CEO of ASC, a U.S. corporation that wholly owns three independent
subsidiary companies and has partial interests in two others.

Al Arnaout directs the efforts of six departments - including an office in
Washington, D.C. - which provide a wide range of services to Saudi Aramco.
Al Arnaout joined Saudi Aramco in 1975 as a systems analyst and quickly
advanced to become a senior organization consultant and Manager of
Organization and Industrial Engineering, Employee Relations, Policy &
Planning. He was General Manager of Exploration Computer Center for six
years in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia before joining Aramco Services Company in
June of 2000.

Al Arnaout has a Bachelor of Science degree in systems engineering from King
Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals in Dhahran. He is Chairman of the
Board of Aramco Services Company and Saudi Refining, Inc.

This breakfast is sponsored by Aramco Services Company.
