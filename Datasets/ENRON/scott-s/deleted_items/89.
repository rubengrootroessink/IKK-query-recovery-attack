SMART TRAVELERS' CORNER: This week, columnist Bob Jones provides tips on saving money on travel.

TRAVEL 101, LESSON ONE - Choices

While this may seem like a strange place to start saving money, it can be the most important part of traveling better and more affordably. In order to be successful in obtaining reduced fares and rates through discount coupons and special offers, you must give special consideration when selecting a travel provider's frequency program.  These programs can offer you valuable travel discounts such as free flights, hotel stays and rental car promotions. There are several factors in determining which travel partners you choose.

First, examine your travel patterns, plans and goals.  Since most vacations include at least some air travel, select an airline alliance that best meets your needs. Next, you will want a hotel plan that works with the airline plan and optimizes your point/mile earning potential.  It is important to remember that affinity cards associated with an airline or hotel chain can easily double your miles and points.  Often times, a travel partner will specify offers linked to a specific credit card.  Consider your telecommunication services in the planning stage as this too can amass points quickly. In this group we find local service, long distance, cell and Internet service.  Finally, rental cars still give points, but not as they used to.  Fifty miles a day is the norm for most agencies, so while they don't add up as quickly as other points, they will provide some clout as a member of their frequent renter program.

Now, if I were a neophyte, I would look long and hard at Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan.  Their program has some unique features that actually caused me to recommend their plan to a traveler in Miami!  Why?  Well, their plan allows miles earned on over ten airlines to be deposited into your Mileage Plan account, and as an added bonus, you can even earn elite status on Alaska without ever having set foot on the fleet with the Aleut on the tail!  Elite status brings special offers and even reduced award redemption in many cases.  In addition to airlines, you can earn miles by staying at over 35 hotel brands from Best Western to Westmark, seven car rental companies and a dozen miscellaneous partners which include Amtrak, Sprint and FTD.com make this my "best to join" program for 2002.  Full terms, conditions and information can be found at http://www.alaskaair.com - click on Mileage Plan at the top of the page.

Your reading assignment for this lesson can be found in the Smart Travelers' Corner, http://www.onetravel.com/advisor/ST_Menu.cfm?&Token=NULL chapters titled, "Choosing Your Airline," under the Hotels section, read, "Frequency Programs," and in the Other Good Stuff section, pick up tips in, "Affinity Cards - Hidden Resources In Your Wallet.

See you on a flight soon,

Bob
