MR. MAXIMILER: Our column from ~OneTravel.com's~ own Frugalist, Bob Jones,
features up-to the-minute tips and deals that maximize your air miles and save
you travel cash.  Read on for this week's "Mr. Maximiler" tip!

The other shoe just dropped!

January is the month of Frequent Flyer offers and program changes. Just
yesterday, I received three MCI, two Sprint and a Nextel promotion in the mail
offering extra miles to join, switch or what have you. I probably will need
them as I also received a press release I had been expecting, "Northwest
Airlines today announced that it is eliminating blackout dates for WorldPerks
award travel..." Wow, that's not what it is supposed to say, it is supposed to
say, "Take advantage of your last chance to book (Northwest) Continental
Airlines Off-Peak Rewards. Beginning June 1, 2002, this reward will no longer
be available." After all, this is what Continental had said the week before and
what I was expecting from Northwest was to be the same announcement simply
because as partners, Continental and Northwest's programs are mirror images of
each other. What I found disturbing is what each carrier didn't say in their
release. The missing words were left to be said by the other partner. That is,
since the programs mirror each other, shouldn't the releases have been the same
and not parsed in such a manner as to require reading of both releases to get a
truer picture?  For the complete story and what you can do, visit
http://www.onetravel.com/advisor/AR_AirlineNews_Article.cfm?&ArticleID=317

See you on a flight soon,


Bob
