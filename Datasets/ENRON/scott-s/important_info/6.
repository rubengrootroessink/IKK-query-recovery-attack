Hi! This is the ezmlm program. I'm managing the
customers@list.frontierairlines.com mailing list.

To confirm that you would like

   sscott5@enron.com

added to the customers mailing list, please send
an empty reply to this address:

   
customers-sc.966267181.fmplodjlfdpdfemdmpmp-sscott5=enron.com@list.frontierair
lines.com

Usually, this happens when you just hit the "reply" button.
If this does not work, simply copy the address and paste it into
the "To:" field of a new message.

This confirmation serves two purposes. First, it verifies that I am able
to get mail through to you. Second, it protects you in case someone
forges a subscription request in your name.


--- Administrative commands for the customers list ---

I can handle administrative requests automatically. Please
do not send them to the list address! Instead, send
your message to the correct command address:

To subscribe to the list, send a message to:
   <customers-subscribe@list.frontierairlines.com>

To remove your address from the list, send a message to:
   <customers-unsubscribe@list.frontierairlines.com>

You can start a subscription for an alternate address,
for example "john@host.domain", just add a hyphen and your
address (with '=' instead of '@') after the command word:
<customers-subscribe-john=host.domain@list.frontierairlines.com>

To stop subscription for this address, mail:
<customers-unsubscribe-john=host.domain@list.frontierairlines.com>

In both cases, I'll send a confirmation message to that address. When
you receive it, simply reply to it to complete your subscription.

If despite following these instructions, you do not get the
desired results, please contact my owner at
customers-owner@list.frontierairlines.com. Please be patient, my owner is a
lot slower than I am ;-)
