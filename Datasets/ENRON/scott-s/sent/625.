I haven't done anything as of yet.  I just really didn't feel like responding 
to him on Friday (I was still pretty floored by the whole thing) and since 
he's out of town till tonight I spent yesterday and today figuring out what I 
want to do.  

I've decided the following...I'm going to give him a call tonight and agree 
to meet for a drink/chat.  I completely agree with you about regretting the 
things you don't do more than the things you do - besides I'm dying of 
curiosity about what he could possibly have to say.  Anyway, I want to try 
and do it tomorrow night so that I can quite turning it over and over in my 
head (I am absolutely sick of thinking about it).  I think it will be hard 
for me to be anything but distant talking to him because, regardless of his 
reasons, he definitely wasn't very considerate over the last few weeks.  Wish 
me luck! (Problem is I'm not sure what I really want the outcome to be).
