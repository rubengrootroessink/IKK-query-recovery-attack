Janet, please meet with Denise (tomorrow if possible) to:

- explain filing system
- hand off filing projects you are working on (anytime between tomorrow and 
next week is fine)
- explain how you do service lists for FERC filings.

Also, one of you will need to contact the appropriate person to get Denise 
access to my Lotus Organizer.
Don't know how to notify the mailroom people to deliver my mail to Denise's 
station but see if you can do this also.

I spoke with Mike, and Emily is going to handle moving the phones.

Merci beaucoup!
