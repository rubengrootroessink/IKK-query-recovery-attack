Just so you can see how this is evolving...
I think we should steer clear of anything involving Energy Services because 
it sounds like we are buying/selling gas.
I've instructed the commercial group to get back to you with a name.  When 
they do, let Lillian Bailey know (x33577).  That is really the only 
information she still needs from us, I think.  
I'm reachable at 713-494-5002 for the rest of today.

OK, here's my 2 cents' worth:

Avale Corp.
I also like Enable.
I think either one would look fine on an EBB list of customers...

Also -- any name we choose could include the words Capacity Management.  But 
I'm not sure we want to or need to be that descriptive.

Here's my best shot(s):


NatCom Energy Services, Inc.

Streamline Energy Services, Inc.

Handyman Energy Services, Inc.

Enable Energy Services, Inc.  (var. Enerable)
