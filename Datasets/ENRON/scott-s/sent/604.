Everything goes O.K.  I met with Ted last week for dinner Thursday night...it 
was VERY enlightening.  I'll forward you the email I sent to my sister-in-law 
(it sums everything up pretty well).  Let me know if you want to grab coffee, 
a drink, etc. tonight or tomorrow night - although I think you've got NCL 
tomorrow.  

Well, we met and had dinner last night.  NOTHING of importance was discussed 
during our entire meal and it was only when I brought things up as we were 
leaving that any actual "talking" occurred.  Here are the basics...

- There is definitely no "us" anymore...and I quote "sometimes these things 
just fade out"
- There is much I didn't know about him and I am sure even more that I still 
don't
- Case in point...He was MARRIED before (yes, you read correctly married)
- Turns out he's been divorced about three years, it didn't end well and he 
hasn't had a relationship that has lasted beyond       2 mos. in those three 
years (even though, by his own admission, he has dated quite a bit) - Can you 
say issues?
- He told me "I know this sounds so trite, but this really has nothing to do 
with you, it's all me."  Of course I agreed with him saying "I know it's you 
Ted, I don't have any problems." (He got a chuckle out of that one)
- I told him about my frustrations and disappointment with how he had handled 
things and he apologised (evidently Kevin told him about our exchange at 
Steak Night) and I also let him know how much I appreciated his handling of 
things in the beginning
- I said I really hated animosity and hard feelings and that as long as he 
hadn't done anything truly horrible to me (i.e. murder a family member, etc.) 
I would really like to leave things on a good note...He agreed.
- He said I was a fantastic girl and that he still really enjoyed hanging out 
and talking with me (although I don't see us doing a lot of that...not very 
healthy for me) 

So all in all I walked away with three very important things 1. A lightened 
load (I got everything of my chest that I wanted to and needed to) 2. My 
dignity (I handled just it as I'd hoped...with composure and wit) 3. A 
clearer since of Ted as a person (He definitely has a lot of issues in his 
life that he has not completely dealt with yet, and might never deal with 
completely)

Anyway, I'm okay with everything and surprisingly feel pretty good.  I'll 
talk to you soon.

Susan

By the way, I told him about the shirt idea (he thought it was funny, and 
maybe just a little harsh)

Talk to you soon, Jen.
