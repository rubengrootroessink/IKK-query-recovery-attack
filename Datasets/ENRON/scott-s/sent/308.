I've discussed the "actual fuel" provision with Christine and Bob and made 
them aware that this is a nonconforming provision that would need to be 
filed, since the FTS-1 rate schedule provides that fuel payments are to be 
made according to the percentages set forth in the rate sheets.  

According to Bob's calculations, the actual fuel used by Duke under this 
contract is likely to exceed the applicable percentages in our tariff.

I don't think FERC or any of our shippers would have any immediate objection 
to our charging actual fuel.  However, I know that fuel is a sensitive issue 
on TW so I wanted to be sure to draw your attention to this provision.  Let 
me know what you think.
