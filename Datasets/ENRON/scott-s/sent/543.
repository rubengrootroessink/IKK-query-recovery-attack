Don't know when you'll get a chance to read this, but I must confess it made 
me a bit teary eyed.  I didn't think he had it in him to be so eloquent.

As for New Year's Eve, I have to say I'm kind of with Kasey.  As much as I'd 
love to see Gary P., I don't really want to risk the drive and I'm guessing 
no one else does either. 

Hope you had a good weekend and I'll talk to you soon.

Sue

Hey, how was the weekend?  Did you at least catch up a little on your rest?
You had one heck of a week but then again I guess that is just old hat for
you.  We had a good time on Saturday.  It is always fun to be on sixth
street close to halloween, even more freaks come out.

OK enough stalling.  I just thought something needed to be said about
wednesday.  We could just go on and act like nothing happened and probably
never see or talk to one another ever again.  I don't like that solution.
My personality is to go with the flow but by doing this you sometimes miss
out on opportunities.  So the traditional me would say it was just one night
and didn't really mean anything, which could possibly be true.  One thing
that I learned from you is that you have to take chances and don't be
intimidated.  You have a very strong personality and I can see where
somebody could easily be intimidated.  Along with that comes someone who is
smart, attractive, outgoing, and somebody who can fit in anywhere, whether
your at the local honky-tonk or at some gala.  The one thing I know about
you is that your going to be successful and I don't mean in the monetary way
because I know that isn't high on the priority list.  I also know that if I
would have never left the company then I probably wouldn't be sitting here
writing this email.

When I was thinking about leaving I didn't think it was going to be that
hard.  I really didn't like the way my life was going and I knew I needed a
change.  Then I sit back and think of all the things I'm going to miss.
People bad talk risk all the time, with the long hours and little respect
you sometimes get it is understandable.  The thing I'm going to miss the
most are all the friendships I have built working in that group.  Sometimes
the toughest times are when you really get to know someone.  But the hardest
thing now is that I will not be around you.  I know that sounds really bad
but the honest truth is I have liked you ever since we started sitting next
to each other.  We had this chemistry and it made the job a little easier
knowing you were there.  I really think the best times I had in Houston were
those couple of weeks we went out after work to have a few drinks.  I also
knew that since we worked together that it probably wasn't the best thing to
get involved.  I really regret that decision right about now.

Alright I guess I have said a lot of sappy stuff and you should know that
I'm not usually like this, which is probably why I didn't call you to share
this info.  I do think some things need to be said or else the other person
will never know.  You are a great person and even though the chips are
stacked against me I needed to let you know this.  I understand that your
under a lot of stress right now and by no means do I want to add on.  The
one thing I wish you would take away from this is that if your 35 and still
looking then you need not look any further.

So I apologize for using this forum to express this I really wanted to talk
to you in person on Friday but I just didn't get a chance much less know
where to start. I hope we stay in touch and if you ever want to go to Gruene
Hall then let me know.  I also don't want to be put in one of your stalker
categories so take this for whatever you want, please don't think of me as
the next SP.

Take care and have a good week.

Kyle

By the way I think that good-bye would have to rank in top of all times, at
least it is number one in my book.
