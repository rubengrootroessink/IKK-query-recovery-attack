Aurora, my changes appear on the attached.
I assume you or AA have updated the numbers for eligible transition costs 
(second paragraph of section 7).  (If you have not, I'm really not sure who 
would have those numbers)
I updated the numbers for environmental costs in the footnotes.  Please call 
(x30596) if you have any questions.
