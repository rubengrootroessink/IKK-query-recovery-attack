Subject: Re: houston, we have a problem....?


boys suck!  i think we may have a comittment-phobe on our hands- ie, when
things actually progress, panick and back out- graceful or not- too intense!
  i should know, being one of them.....i know you're frustrated, confused,
angry and disappointed- but please bear in mind- this is the result of HIS
character flaws, not yours.  AND, as we've droned on and on about, we
shouldn't have to settle.  ever.  sue, you've just met mr. 90%- and isn't it
funny how that last 10% seems to mean EVERYTHING?!!!?  w/o being too abrupt,
as outside council i'd advise a serious fracturing of this 'relationship'.
he's given you no definition, very little respect, and enough mixed and
incomplete messages to keep you wondering and holding out for that perfect
sign, or comment that will make everything fall into place- NOT FAIR.
you're simply too good to tolerate that bullshit, and you'd be doing
yourself a disservice to stand for it.  i guess you kind of dictate how
people can treat you by what you're willing to put up with.  you're worth
alot more, and you're not desperate...lonely, maybe, but it's not the same.
ok- i'm getting angry just writing about this!  anyways- love my classes,
and london is really starting to grow on me.  so different and new- and
after a 30 min discussion about "those girls and guys" in texas w/ claudia,
and i'm more and more glad to be away from houston- present 'company' (+a
handful) excluded of course.  it's going to be a great adventure, and it's
nice to be reminded of how much more there is than texas, no matter how
great it is.  am looking forward to my new place (should be in this weekend)
and starting to travel.....can't wait for your visit- you'll like claudia-
she'll be a great partner in crime for going out, til you arrive, and the
circle widens, j'espere!  double check w/ kates about when she gets back
from egypt- i know she's gone over my b-day, so i hope she'll be back by the
time you get here.  plus, would be good for you to be here for her 'party'
at the texas embassy....must go to class, but hang in there, and start
thinking global...cheerio....
