Aquarius:
      The conjunction between the Sun and Moon is a wonderful symbol of
                      togetherness and unity. You may have been feeling 
distinctly out of sorts
                      lately with your partner, and are sorely in need of 
some tender loving care.
                      Perhaps you both need to make the effort to be nice to 
each other. I mean
                      really nice, not just pretending. See now, isn't that a 
lot better! There's
                      mileage in this one yet.
