Ben was actually already planning on going.  In fact he informed me he would 
be bringing a friend from Canada.  

FYI - I didn't know there was a "friend" in Canada until very recently 
(although I had my suspicions) and further more had never heard a name until 
today.  Regardless, any friend of y'alls is a friend of mine.  Also, Nick is 
going to bring Amy (his significant other).  

Should be an interesting evening.
