Wow, you struck a nerve with this one!  My grandmother (Mema) is an absolute 
nightmare when around family, but really sweet to everyone else!  Everyone 
tells me how wonderful and nice she is (she meets lots of people I know on 
her commute to her office downtown), and I just have to keep my mouth shut 
because no one would believe some of the things she says & does.  Example:  
over Christmas she kept trying to tell my 8-months pregnant sister all kinds 
of delivery-room horror stories!  I finally had to yell at her to get her to 
shut up.  Maybe you remember Mema; she calls every so often and bullies 
receptionists and secretaries into tracking me down instead of just leaving a 
message.  Of course, everyone but me thinks it is really cute.

Hope your holiday was really great!

Why is it some family members are more courteous to strangers than to each
other?

Wow!  So true!!!  Have a good Monday!
