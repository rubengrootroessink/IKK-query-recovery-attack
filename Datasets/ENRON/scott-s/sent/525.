Thanks Carrie.  

I went ahead and made the counterparty name change so that it will be 
properly reflected next month.

Susan,
I believe deal NK7690 is a Duke deal, and not EL Paso.  At least that is what 
TAGG shows.  Would you please update your sheet to reflect the change for 
next month.  
Thanks so much,
Carrie
