Dolores,

I was wondering who my best resource would be to talk to about the changes to 
the analyst program and how they affect me.  Specifically, I wanted to get 
some more information on the Third-Year Analyst Rotation and its requirements 
(as I am currently half-way through my second rotation), as well as the 
different tracks available within the program.  If you could direct to the 
proper individual(s) I would really appreciate it.  

Thanks,
Susan Scott
