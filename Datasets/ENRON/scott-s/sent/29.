The Mark Morris group performance is the last weekend of this month, the 27th 
- 29th.  See the website www.spahouston.org and click on "Program Notes" for 
a detailed description.  

Bill and I will leave for Austin tomorrow a.m. as early as we can manage.  
I'm not picky about where we go for dinner, but was thinking Bill might enjoy 
going to the Bitter End brew pub -- I'm sure they don't take reservations but 
it should not be a problem if we go early enough.  

The landscaper removed all the bushes in the front beds and it looks weird!  
Can't wait for her to get the new gravel in my driveway.

We'll call tomorrow a.m. if not sooner!  Have a good day!
