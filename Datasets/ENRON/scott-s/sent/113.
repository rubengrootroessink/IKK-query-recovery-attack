Hi Mum!  No, tickets were hard to come by.  Tried to get some they released a 
couple of weeks ago, but didn't realize everyone would send their secretaries 
and interns downstairs to hold places in line!  I'm sure the VPs will get 
tired of going to the games, and start giving tickets away. 

Tonight is the big CAM gala.  Bill was in trial all week and had no time to 
go shopping, or even to get measured for an ordinary tux rental, so he 
borrowed one from Andre (who owns 4).  Andre is a couple of inches shorter 
than Bill.  Depending on the overall look, I may or may not acknowledge that 
Bill is my date.  My 60's dress I got at Wear It Again Sam looks fabulous.  
It is a sleeveless gown with an empire waist; the top is maroon velvet and 
the rest is very heavy pink satin.  Since it wraps in the back I was able to 
move the hooks over to get it to fit.  Dress was $38 but it cost $35 to get 
it hemmed!  Ann and I were considering asking Mema to do our hair, but I'm 
really going to be pressed for time this afternoon.  Too bad the party is not 
on a Saturday.

Our plans for the rest of this weekend are still up in the air.  What are you 
doing the weekend of the 16th?  Bill has signed up for the MS150 again that 
weekend.  If you are free that weekend why don't I plan to come either Fri. 
or Sat. a.m.  Let me know.

Our law conference begins Thurs. a.m. in San Antonio.  Dot (Staci's boss) is 
having a party at her house on Lake McQueeney on Wednesday, so I'm driving 
Frazier and Tony in the Dentmobile that morning.  We really do have a fun 
group; it should be a good time.  If K&J want company I'll drive over to see 
them on Thurs. night instead of going to the awards dinner, which was a big 
drag last year.  I'll call them this weekend and see what Jim's travel plans 
are.

Today we'll find out about settlement in the California proceeding...this 
will decide whether I will be tied up in hearings for most of May.  Keep your 
fingers crossed!

Love,
Sooz

Hi, Sooz--Big article about the Enron ballpark today--did the company treat
you to the opening?

I'm up to my ears in jobs around the house in preparation for Eric's visit.
It's always a good thing to have company--you get all kinds of things done
you should have done a long time ago.  I painted half of my bedroom last
night, and the other half will have to wait until I decide what to do with
the windows.  But, I needed to paint over the patch on the fireplace wall,
and the holes left by the blinds I took down ages ago.  Didn't know what
color I had used, so I chose a new one.  You can't really tell that I've
stopped at the corners.

Jim is still unsure about his business trip rescheduled and rescheduled for
next week, the 4th and 5th.  I'm hoping it's canceled because Karin asked if
I would come, and that really puts me in a bind with Eric coming in on the
6th as far as cooking, and last minute things.  Sally is coming on the 8th,
so if the trip is postponed until that week, she'll be around.

Are you still going to SA for your continuing ed?

Did I tell you I bought 4 rocking chairs for the back porch?  They're not as
comfortable as I thought they'd be.

Hope you have a good weekend.  love, mum
