Just back in from my front yard -- a military jet of some sort is circling my 
neighborhood and making a tremendous racket!  Several of my neighbors were 
also out, so I was not the only one staring at the sky.  I don't know whether 
we'll see fireworks later or if we've already missed them.  Jose and Gigi's 
party was attended by more kids than ever.  There were a lot of West U 
parents I did not recognize, but there were some lawyers from the Latin 
American section that I know, so we had at least a few people to talk to.  We 
did not stay long, just had some of the good Goode & Company BBQ, helped Gigi 
with the pinatas, and got home around 7.  The traffic on I-45 was really 
starting to pile up so I am glad we left when we did.

Enjoyed the weekend and I'm looking forward to your visit.

Love,
Sooz
