Interesting.  I seem to remember that under Texas law, everything goes to the 
surviving spouse.  Any community property issues between Greg and ex should 
have been settled in the divorce proceedings.  But it's been a while since I 
looked -- I will ask Bill for a second opinion.  

In any event, a will is a good idea, especially when kids are involved.  If, 
God forbid, the worst should happen, you can bet that ex + kids would make 
life even more difficult for you in what would already be a tough time!  Bill 
doesn't do wills but he could probably recommend someone who would do a will 
for cheap.

Can you ask Bill if he knows anything about wills?  Dena told me that if Greg 
were to die and we didn't have a will, I would get half and his ex would get 
the other half for the kids.  Greg disagrees but this is what Dena was told 
by her lawyer if Curtis were to die.  It's not something I'd like to think 
about, and it's not like we own that much right now anyway, but when we get a 
house, that's a different story.

Thanks
