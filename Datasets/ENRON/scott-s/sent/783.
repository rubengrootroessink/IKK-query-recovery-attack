May there always be work for your hands to do, 
  May your purse always hold a coin or two. 
  May the sun always shine warm on your windowpane, 
  May a rainbow be certain to follow each rain. 
  May the hand of a friend always be near you, And may God fill your heart 
with gladness to cheer you. -- Irish Blessing
