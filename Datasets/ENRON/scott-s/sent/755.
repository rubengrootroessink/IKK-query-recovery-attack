Hey Math-Wiz,

I completely understand your plight.  I too am suffering a two o'clock, 
post-lunch slump (the coffee is simply not working at this point).  Anyway, I 
think a change of clothes prior to Steak Night is probably a good idea.  
Also, driving tomorrow is not a problem... just let me know the gate code, 
apt. #, etc.  Along those same lines, what time did you want to head over 
there?  (For better-safe-than-sorry reasons, due to my job, I think no 
earlier than 7:30 p.m. is our best bet.)

Hope you're having a lovely day and don't work too hard (Ha!!).

Susan

Hey Shorty,

I hope your day is going well.  We took our MD out for lunch because he is 
relocating to NY and will spend about a week in Houston a month.  Well, to 
make a short story long, we ate at Erma's (great food) but I am getting very 
sleepy (life is difficult I know) from eating way too much.  I assume we are 
going home to change into some casual/hot weather clothes before dinner 
tomorrow and I may need you to pick me up.  I am still looking for some good 
jokes that I can send to you that are funny but still moderately appropriate 
(most are completely inappropriate - I have sick friends).  Check out 
www.darwinawards.com for some funny but true stories.  I'll talk to you later.

Ted
