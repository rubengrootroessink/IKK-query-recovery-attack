Hope your move into the new apartment went well.  I'm sure you are going  to 
have so much fun living there, especially since you really will have a 
roommate now.

Thought I'd give you a little bit of an update regarding Ted...

So I didn't get back to the office until Wednesday last week because I was in 
Austin Tuesday for that recruiting trip.  When I got in I of course 
immediately checked my email...nothing.  I also didn't have any messages at 
any of the 3 phones I can be reached through.  Come Thursday afternoon, still 
no interaction...I am pissed.  About 2:00 p.m. he calls.  He asks me about 
San Diego and I ask him about Austin...both trips were great.  We discuss 
UCLA and UT football for  a while...I of course get riled up.  He informs me 
that he is going to be trading corn (yes, you heard me corn) for Enron.  
While he is very excited about trading I get the impression he feels a little 
overwhelmed and he is a very concerned about how much trading will limit his 
vacation time.  He said that he and Darren (the guy he works with) had been 
meeting with consultants all week to get up to speed and therefore the week 
had pretty much just been one long meeting.  It is around this time that he 
brings up the vacation thing and how, to his dismay, as a trader you work 
when the markets are open and you're only off when they're closed.  As a 
result, he's decided to get in his long visit home ASAP, i.e. "I'm leaving 
tomorrow (Friday) to go to California for a week."  I make sure I heard him 
correctly and yes he said leaving, tomorrow and  1 whole week (7 days) AND at 
no point does he ask to get together before he leaves.  So, that was 
Thursday.  I'm down on his floor again on Friday to talk to my old group and, 
to my dismay, run in to him.  We exchange pleasantries, I ask him when he's 
leaving (5:00 p.m.), he informs me he is going to sleep for the entire week 
in an attempt to catch-up, I tell him to have fun and that's that.

Anyway, I was not able to get him out for a drink to find out what's going on 
and now I just have to wait.  Any thoughts?

Talk to you soon,
Susan

So I'm thinking of taking that T-shirt Ted gave me and writing this on the 
back of it...

I dated Ted Noble and all I have to show for it is this lousy t-shirt.

Dont'cha love it?
