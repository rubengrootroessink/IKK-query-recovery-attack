Bummer.  Too bad all of us are captive to Eric's schedule.
Bill and I enjoyed our too-short trip to the GC.  We hiked down Bright Angel 
trail to the second rest stop, which was plenty for me.  It was pretty hot.  
Wish we could have stuck around longer but Bill had to be back for a trial.  
Talk about restrictive travel schedules.  
I was thinking about you and Karin and wanting to take your customary nature 
trips...you know, when Grayson is a little older, we could go on some trips 
and just take turns staying at the hotel/cabin with her while everyone else 
goes hiking/climbing/whatever.  You might have to pay for extra hotel days 
that way, but at least you would get to go.  In the meantime, what about 
staying in one place for a week or so -- a beach house, for example.  Eric 
permitting, I think it would be fun to get everyone together in Florida or 
Colorado sometime within the next year.
My car is ready at the shop.  Yay!
Ciao,
Sus.

Sus:

Not to complain,but AARRRRRRRRRRGGGHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Now that we have canceled our reservations for the cabin at Zion for the end
of October, because Eric's window of opportunity for travel in California
was limited to that specific two week period, and have been on the phone for
a week making earlier arrangements and putting a deposit down, it seems
that, "well, you see there is this car race in Carmel and, well we would
really rather go earlier in the month"

Well we lost the cabin and spent money for accommodations that are not as
good, and that's why we checked before.
