Okay gang, it's time to rally the troops.  Evidently last week wasn't good 
for any of us to get together at our local watering hole (a.k.a Little 
Woodrow's)...but, I'm hoping the story is a little different this week.  Our 
own Nick Stephan is back in H-town for the week and has made a special 
request for a full-fledged "Steak Night" (that means good attendance).  Not 
that I ever need an excuse to enjoy good company, steak, beer, etc. at LW's, 
but if I did I could think of few better reasons than a visiting ex-pat.  
Besides, given the absolutely beautiful weather we are currently enjoying, 
the picnic tables and deck are beckoning.  I'm going to set a tentative 
meeting time of 7:30 p.m. this Wednesday...get back to me at your convenience 
and let me know if we should stick with that time or not.  Hope everyone had 
a relaxing weekend and is having a good Monday (isn't that an oxymoron?).

Susan
