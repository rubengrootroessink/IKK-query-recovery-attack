The counterparty for that deal is Enron Omaha and the contact is Larry 
Paulou.  I am working on clearing up any other deals booked with the 
counterparty as New this morning.  Let me know if there is anything else you 
need.

Susan, Joe,

The referenced TAGG # was entered as a 'New Counterparty', can you please let 
me know what counterparty this is so we can correctly assess the counterparty 
exposure.

Thank you,

Russell
