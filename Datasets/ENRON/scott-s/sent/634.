I tell ya Mo, it's weird.

                   HOROSCOPE:      Weekly  



                   For September 25-October 1: Better
                   communication is indicated this week. Issues
                   that have bogged you down are effectively
                   addressed. Don't get up and leave until you get
                   every answer you need. Be direct and honest,
                   without losing your temper. Even if others
                   misbehave, continue pursuing what you believe
                   is right. An agreement is either out of balance or
                   no longer desirable. You CAN make
                   improvements to existing paperwork, contracts,
                   and agreements -- as long as you remain
                   friendly, respectful, and well-prepared. There
                   can be no hostility on your end, or negotiations
                   will break down.

puh-lease!   i know i just emailed you, but i had to respond.  sometimes
it's hard for me to email back in a timely manner since, w/o a laptop, i
only have computer mon-thurs.  sue, PROMISE me you WILL not sacrifice your
integrity and allow him to weasle in just b/c he has a guilty conscience.
i'm pretty sure you won't, but i'm just imagining as i sit here the stories
your mom and dad have to tell.....and that's just the tip of the iceberg!i'm
a firm believer in the one strike and you're out thoery, and of course,
based on a, his behavior in the last few weeks, b., the sage words of his
'trusty' friend kevin, who DID give your parents the time of day, c., his
behavior steak nite, and d., HIS BEHAVIOR!!!!- i'd say he's been benched.  i
wouldn't rule out an 'explanation beer', but i thinks it's time to lower the
blow, so to speak, cut your losses, and run like hell....

Subject: Re: We have closure! (well, sort-of)


i have to admit, when i saw the copyline for this, i began to panic.  i
pictured you in a drunken about- to-go-over the edge rage....and then ted
stumbling onto the scene, and you unloading.  however, in lieu of the facts,
i'd say this was an unequivicable 'victory', if such a word can be used....
i think it's fair to say that you ended up w/ more on your side of the
tug-of-war rope, so to speak.  and although it's frustrating to see what
once seemed to be 'potential' turn into shit, it's easier to walk away- at
least i'd imagine it to be.  sounds like you're going to have a whirl-wind
trip- guess enron only can open the gates of hell to let you out for brief
blocks of time......isn't that kind of like the myth about persephone
escaping from hades......?  will try to plan a suitable agenda- still in
ther 'dazed and confused' period- been more concerned w/ where i can find
trash bags than hopping bars so far, but will try to fine tune my skills in
the time remaining- must go to class, but will write more later.  hate to
say it, but you prob. will be saddled w/ a care package for me from mom-
will try to make it in the 80lbs or less range....
