Okay, so here's the debate...There's a flight out Friday night leaving 
Houston at 11:00 pm and getting into SD around 2:20 in the morning.  The next 
earlier flight leaves Houston around 5:30 pm but unfortunately there's no way 
I could make that one because of  work.  The other option is to fly in 
Saturday morning like I did last time.  I'm leaning towards leaving Friday 
night and just taking a cab to your place as long as you don't mind waking up 
to let me in.  That way we'd have all day Saturday to do things and I 
wouldn't leave on Sunday until around 3:30 (or I could even leave around 
6:00).  Anyway, I was just wondering what you think about the various 
options?  Let me know and I'll try and book this thing today.
