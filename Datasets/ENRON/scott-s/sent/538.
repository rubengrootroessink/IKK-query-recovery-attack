Thanks.  As for getting talked into buying all the extras, I'm not as easily 
convinced of things as some people I know ( Cow fingers?).  Halloween at the 
Big E wasn't nearly as fun as I'd hoped...I mean, they keep the candy in 
machines and you have to actually pay for it...that just borders on cruel.

By the way,  you'll have to question  the college coaches and sports writers 
out there if you have any issues with the rankings.  I am merely the 
messenger.
