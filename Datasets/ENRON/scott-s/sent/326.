Hi Mum -- not going to DC until next week.
Any ideas for Karin's birthday?  Maybe we could look for something this 
weekend.
I plan to get out into the nice weather today as soon as I can!
Going to Brennan's tonight w/Craig.
Dianna isn't coming with me to Austin so I guess I will just come first thing 
Sat. a.m.  I'll give you a call tomorrow!
S.

Hi, Sooz!

Guess you didn't have to make your trip.

Had thought that seeing Carmen in Houston even though it's being presented
here in May would be interesting, but think I'll pass on it.  I return Oct 18
and don't know if Karin wants me to spend the weekend with her and the Bug or
not since Jim will be gone.  But, I might come the end of Oct to do some
shopping.  Eric will be coming sometime the first 2 wks of Nov to use his
free ticket by the 15th.  We're going to get his reservation made when he
picks me up at the San Jose airport.  I'll be coming at some point for Ann
Kelly's birthday which is in Nov.  It's always difficult to find a date with
everyone's busy schedule--especially Ann's.  She never stops.

Went to the outlet this morning and bought some shoes but couldn't find
anything else.  That's always a lost cause for me and it will be a long time
before I go again.

Gorgeous day here, but it's warming up again.  So pleasant sleeping with the
bedroom door open to the porch.

Looking forward to seeing you.  Love, mum
