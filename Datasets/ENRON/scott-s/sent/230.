Hi Mum!  If you want to come to Houston for the July 8 art crawl, that would 
be fun.  I plan to meet more of the gallery owners and talk to them about 
what they do.  Who knows, having my own gallery might actually become part of 
my long-range plan.  If not, I will have met some interesting people.

If you want to come to Houston sooner, I do not have much going on after my 
Sat. a.m. class at Rice, although I do have to catch a plane to D.C. on 
Monday morning.

The week is going OK.  All the tennis and swimming has left me with sore 
muscles so this is my night off.  Am planning to do some more house chores so 
I do not end up with another weekend like the last.

I'm still planning on coming to Austin next weekend, I'm just not sure when, 
but I'll let you know.

Call if you get lonely! 

Love,
Sooz

Hi, Sooz,

Got home about 1 p.m. today and can already feel my mood sinking--not ready
to get back into my solo mode.

Enjoyed being with the little bugaroo--even with the diarrhea, she was in a
good mood with the exception of an occasional sore bottom.  She smiles all
the time.  It does wear me out considerably when I have her all day long
though, and, especially this time, when I was tired from our trip and Eric's
visit.

I must think about a trip to Houston.  Are you aware of the big Houston art
day in the galleries on July 8th?  Just caught a glimpse of it when thumbing
through the new SW Art Mag.  I'll track it down and give you the particulars.
 (You'll have to review your travel schedule with me again.)

Hope you're having a good week.  love, Mum
