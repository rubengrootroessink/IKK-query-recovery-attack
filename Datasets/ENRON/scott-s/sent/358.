Unfortunately I can't go to Austin next weekend; I've planned to go to L.A. 
to visit Sue.  I am bringing my new beau with me!  You will meet Craig at 
some point.  I think it's also safe to say you will like him much better than 
Bill.
I'm tentatively planning to come to Austin the weekend of Nov. 11, but you 
know that is totally up to D.E. (Dreamy Eric).
In the meantime, send Bug photos if possible!

Hola and happy Friday! Just a note to let you know that we will be going to
Austin next weekend for wig control.  Might you be able to join us there?
Jim left this morning with Dave to go to Zion.  It will be a good male
bonding kind of trip I guess.  Dave and Sandy (excuse me, David and
Sandra...)are expecting a baby in December so it will kind of be a "last
hurrah" for him, I guess! Anyway, mum is going to help me with bug duty this
weekend for which I am most thankful.  Now I can get at least be assured of
getting the routine cleaning done.  Well, let me know if you can make it to
Austin next weekend, otay?
