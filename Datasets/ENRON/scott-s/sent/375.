The Star Diva has spoken!  I believe she is correct in everything but the 
last part...if you really wanted to go somewhere by yourself, I know you 
would come back.  And I would miss you while you were gone!  I cannot imagine 
wanting to go on a trip without you, and I don't consider myself a 
"wanderer," either.

Since every Saj is equal parts idealist and gambler, your relationship
should be very interesting.
You're great pals, marvelous traveling companions, a pair of high-flying,
high-rolling
activist/adventurers. Just come down to earth once in awhile -- or find
someone else to
do it for you. This union requires periodic reality checks. You share each
others ideals, interests
and adventures like no one else can. Both of you like to read, study,
observe, learn and teach.
When you're doing all those things together, life may get exhausting but
never boring.
Travel is part of the glue that holds you together. So here's a warning:
Separate vacations
are a no-no. Each of you is such a wanderer, somebody might not come back --
or remain at home.
