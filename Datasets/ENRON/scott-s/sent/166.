Hi there!  I was not able to launch the photo but was able to see it in 
"View" mode on my Lotus Notes.  What a pretty girl!

I assume you'll be in Austin for Mother's Day?  Let me know.  I was thinking 
of cooking brunch if the whole gang is going to be there, but if it is just 
me and Mum maybe we'll just go out.  I have no idea what to buy her!  must do 
some shopping today or tomorrow.

Trivia time:  last night I went to the Astros game with some people from 
work.  One guy brought his girlfriend, Thani-ta, who is from Thailand.  She 
likes to eat at Nit Noi when she is in town!  She told me she has a dog 
called Nit Noi, which means "little bit."  Now you know!

Have a good day; hope to see you in Austin.

Love,
proud auntie sooz
