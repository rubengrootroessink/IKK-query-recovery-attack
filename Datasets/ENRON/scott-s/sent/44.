Subject: Transwestern Contract Approval Request

TRANSWESTERN PIPELINE COMPANY
   CONTRACT APPROVAL REQUEST


Please review the attached non-standard discount letter to Phillips Petroleum 
Company.  Phillips has agree to extend their 30,000 Dth/d Ignacio to El 
Paso/Blanco contract for five years beginning 2/1/2001.  The one-part 
seasonal rate structure of $.04 (April-Oct) and $.035 (Nov-March) will 
escalate by $.005  each of the last two years.  Phillips may use a south to 
north alternate flow path for an incremental $.01 based on actual utilization.


Please  approve via REPLY WITH HISTORY.  
All officer approvals will be faxed to Bill Cordes for final Presidential 
approval
