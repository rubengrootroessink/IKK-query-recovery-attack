Hi yourself,

Glad to hear you all had a good time in Thailand, although I get the 
impression you could have done without some of the sights.  Mom thinks it 
must be fate that this guy and I keep bumping into each other.

Along those lines, I had an absolutely incredible weekend.  I drove to 
Harlingen Saturday morning/afternoon (5 hr. drive) for a friend's wedding and 
then drove to Austin to meet up with Emily on Sunday.  We ate at Guerro's and 
then hit Cedar door for a little while.  There wasn't anything going on there 
so I suggested we try Cedar Street.  Funny thing is Ted, that's his name, 
walks by our table at the bar.  He stopped to say hello and ended up sitting 
down with us the rest of the evening.  His friends joined us as soon as they 
had been shot down by the girls they had been trying to woo.  We ended up 
going to Polly Esters for a little while to do some dancing.  Before we 
parted ways he asked if we had any plans for Monday night and got my cell 
phone number.  Needless to say I was feeling pretty good.  He called us 
Monday and we made plans to meet up after dinner -- we ate at Sullivan's, it 
was very good.  His birthday is July 4 (how great is that?) so I brought him 
one of those travel size bottles of Crown from the honor bar as a birthday 
gift...Big Hit.  Anyway, spent the whole night talking and getting to know 
each other and all I can say is he seems like a really good guy.  (One of the 
best signs was his reproach of denim shorts on guys, especially cut-offs...be 
sure and tell Chuck about that one because I know it's something he feels 
pretty strongly about as well.)  So at this point I'll pretty much just run 
through the stats:

Height :   6'2" - 6'3"
Weight : about 225 lbs.
Education: UCLA (undergraduate and MBA) AND Law School ( I'm not sure where)
Birthday: 7/4/69 -- YES, he was born in a different decade than me...think it 
may be more of an issue for him than me.
Hometown: Santa Barbara, CA

ETC:  Youngest of three children.  Appears to like/be close to his family.
  Irish Catholic (we actually discussed religion)
  His dad was in the Navy
  Favorite Movies -- Fletch, Caddy Shack...he definitely has a good sense of 
humor and likes to laugh
  He really likes Texas...would like to have a ranch/lakehouse somewhere in 
the hill country

Best Quotes:    "Every California guys idea of a dream girl is a girl in 
jeans a t-shirt and cowboy boots." 
  "Every Texas girls idea of a dream guy is a guy who lives on a ranch, has 
an good education, is comfortable financially and is also a great    
businessman.  Only problem is there are only four of those guys out there and 
three of them are married."
  "Texas girls have the ability to wrap a man around their finger quicker 
than any group of women I've ever met."
  "I really want to learn how to two step."
  
So, as I'm sure you can tell there are definitely some attractive 
characteristics to this guy (to boot he was a complete gentleman in every 
capacity).  There are no plans as of yet, but I will be sure to keep you 
informed of any progress.  Write back soon and let me know how the apartment, 
the job hunt and everything else is going.

Susan

Hey Susan,

What's with this new man who keeps popping up
everywhere?  I heard you have seen a lot of him
lately!  You'll have to e mail me back and fill me in
on the scoop.

We had a great time in Thailand.  They are right when
they say it is exotic.  We saw some pretty ronchy
things there, too.  I'm not sure it if were the old
men with the young boys and a million of those clubs
or if the clubs "featuring" women were worse.  Anyway,
we got to see and do some pretty interesting things
and ate some really good food.  Chuck is expanding his
palate (sp?).  Hope all is well in Houston!

Chris
