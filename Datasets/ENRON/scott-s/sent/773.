                   HOROSCOPE:   Weekly   



                   For May 2000: Reassess your goals and
                   friendships. Things have changed. Are you
                   satisfied with your job, relationships, and
                   immediate future? May brings things to light
                   that have been buried or disguised. Take a
                   cool calm steady look at what surfaces. . . and
                   decide if a change in direction is warranted.
                   It's clear that your work scenario needs
                   refurbishing and your daily schedule cries out
                   for major rehab. But first and foremost, you'll
                   get your second wind by dropping tension
                   and frustration mid month, increasing the
                   probability for better relations with friends,
                   coworkers, and relatives. Try to establish
                   healthy, positive change no later than the Full
                   Moon. Take steps to insure your financial and
                   business future on or before May 28.
