Julie,

Sorry for the delayed response.  I can't express to you how excited I am to 
be coming out there this weekend.  After the last week and a half of work I 
am in desperate need of rest and relaxation (that of course means lots of 
shopping).  As far as activities go, I'm pretty much up for anything.  My 
guess is I'm probably going to want to take a quick nap when I get in 
Saturday morning before starting the weekend's activities, but after that I 
say we just get going.  The symphony sounds incredible as do the races or the 
polo match so I'll just leave the final choices to your discretion.  I would 
definitely be up for a trip to the zoo if you want to go, but considering I 
go there every time I'm in San Diego I could miss it in order to do/see some 
other things.  The only things I insist upon are ample time outdoors and good 
seafood.  Anyway,  I arrive in San Diego on America West flight 2180 at about 
9:00 a.m. and leave Monday at 6:10 p.m. so we've almost got three full days 
to work with. 

Love,
Susan

-- Also, if you could give me an idea of what kind of items I need to pack 
depending on our activities it might prevent me from committing gross 
overpacking...Thanks.
