Last month Lindy and I began looking into adding a provision to TW's tariff 
allowing shippers to elect to purchase fuel gas from TW.  There is good 
precedent for this and I think it would be fairly easy to accomplish as long 
as we don't try to make the purchase of fuel from TW mandatory (see the 
attached memo).  Mary Kay, as you and I discussed, we will need to address 
the fuel overrecovery issue before moving forward with this.
