It was very small and petty of me, but I couldn't resist.  Start with the 
last message and work your way up to get the full story.  

Good luck studying,
Susan

Although, as a women, "cojones" aren't necessarily the best attribute to 
have...there never has been, nor will there ever be a question of my 
possessing them - even you would have to concede that much.  As for the bet, 
if I recall correctly (and I always do) someone once said they had a little 
bit of a "problem" gambling and I could not in good conscious have acted as 
an enabler.  And, a true fan (longhorn or not) is there through the good 
times and the bad and believe me I been there through it all (a degrading 
loss to your alma mater, as well as an unbelievably beautiful victory over 
Nebraska) always managing to stick it out no matter how bleak things got.  
Speaking of which it must sting being beat by the last place team in your 
conference...but I'm sure the Pac-10's record against non-conference 
opponents is really helping to ease that blow.  Speaking of feather's in the 
conference cap, looks like our next national champion is going to be from the 
Big 12 - will wonders never cease.

My Monday is going great, thank you very much and I will show extreme 
restraint and refrain from any Chips comments ( Besides, I don't have time to 
type that much ).  UCLA could stand a chance next year if the NFL doesn't 
prove too tempting to some of your vets...how does that saying go,  "Like 
rats fleeing a sinking ship?"

This email would have been impressive if you had the "cojones" to bet 
up-front but being a true longhorn fan explains your lack of spine.  I don't 
think Texas is that good rather A&M is that bad.  Besides, we all know that 
the Pac-10 had the best record against non-conference opponents.  UCLA will 
dominate next year and Texas will be forced to play second fiddle to the 
likes of Oklahoma, Nebraska, Kansas State etc.  yet again.  I hope your 
Thanksgiving went well and you had some fun in Austin.  I will give you 
credit on one thing, the vest is a no-no and my days of playing Chip are over 
(the vest is being given to an aggie - those cult like people).  No old age 
references to the show Chips because that would just be mean.  I hope your 
Monday is going well.  

ps: I was rooting for the Longhorns and I am glad they waxed the Aggies.

Well, given the impressive results of Friday's game, I suppose I should've 
taken the bet...I mean I knew we were good, but I didn't realize we were THAT 
good.  Watching the game I couldn't help but remember some comments made not 
too long ago about this being a building season and that the Horns would be a 
force to be reckoned with come the next two seasons - - I love it when I'm 
right.  With an increasingly more confident sophomore quarterback leading the 
charge and three (count them three) very mature freshman receivers all eager 
to make big plays, not to mention last year's top quarterback recruit Chance 
Mock serving as a back-up, next season promises to be something to watch.  My 
condolences on your prospects not looking quite as bright .

Hope you had a nice Thanksgiving and good luck helping all of your Aggie 
co-workers through this trying time.

Susan

(Oh and Chip, I'd store the Gig'em sweater-vest away for the next 360 days or 
so if you want to avoid any post-game ridicule...in a round about way you are 
an "Ag" man now.)
