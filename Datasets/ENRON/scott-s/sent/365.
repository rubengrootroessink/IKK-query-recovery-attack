Mike, as we discussed yesterday, please get a copy of the following exhibits 
to the "Happy Trails" application in Docket No. CP99-163-000:

Exhibit K - Cost of facilities

Exhibit O - Depreciation and depletion

Please send them directly to Lorraine Lindberg at EB4150G.  If you have any 
questions she can be reached at 713-853-5403.  Or -- I'll be here the rest of 
the day today.

Thank you!
