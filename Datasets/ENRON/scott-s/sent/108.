Subject: Calpine O&M Section 5.4

The attached electronic version of Section 5.4 integrates the changes noted 
by underline on the hard copy I left in your office the other day.  I took 
this opportunity to also divide Section 5.4 into 2 subparagraphs for 
clarity's sake.  I also inserted a new  sentence at the end of subparagraph A 
which was suggested by Enron Risk Management at a meeting I had with them 
yesterday.  I will be adding this insert in the standard Limitation of 
Liabilitysection in the GPG O&M forms of agreement.  Please replace the 
currect section 5.4 in the Calpine O&M with the attached.
