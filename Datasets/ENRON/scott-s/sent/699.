Sometimes I really worry about you...

I know it's not kind to laugh at the misfortune of others, but I must say I 
was rolling when I read your email.  It's a good thing I didn't send the 
other card I was debating over last night which alluded to the possibility of 
you and Darren spending too much time together (not as funny in light of your 
shack last night).  So how did you explain your attire this morning to your 
MD? 

Hope the presentation was a rousing success.

Shorty

Hey,

Thanks for the card.  I got a good chuckle out of it.  You will appreciate 
this story.  I go to leave last night around 12:00 but somehow I don't have 
my keys.  Well, they were in my locker at the Met, which of course is closed 
at this point.  So, I stay at Darren and sleep on his couch.  Well, I try to 
sleep but his fire alarm keeps beeping ever 1-2 minutes and is really 
annoying.  So, being a guy, I take the alarm completely out of the wall with 
my leatherman tool.  Finally go to sleep and arrive in my same clothes and 
baseball hat at work around 7:30 to pick up my keys and head home and 
shower/change.  Of course this cannot go perfectly, so I run into my MD on 
the way to the Met parking lot. Smooth.  I finally arrive back at work around 
9:00 and miss the group's morning weather briefing.  I find this whole thing 
pretty funny and it is all due to my keen organizational skills.  I'll talk 
to you later.

Ted
