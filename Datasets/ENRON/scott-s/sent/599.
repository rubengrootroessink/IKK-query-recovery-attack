I always forget what the time difference is so I thought I might be able to 
catch you "real time."  

I went to the game Saturday with Travis, Corey, Mike and a friend of his.  
Kathy was getting her certification for spinning classes and thus I was given 
the responsibility of baby-sitting Corey and Travis.  Anyway, Trav's pledge 
class had a reunion at the house after the game and I think it may have 
single-handedly cured me of wanting men in their early thirties.  The single 
guys from their class are definitely still single for a reason.  Also, you've 
gotta tell Chuck that Kinzer's date for the game was a year younger than me 
(although I will say, after meeting her, you would've thought she was much 
younger).  I think 27-28 may be a better range.  Old enough to know who they 
are and what they want, but still young enough to explain their unattached 
status on career focus.

Talk to you soon,
Susan
