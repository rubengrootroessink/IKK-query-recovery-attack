Low blow with the "weekends are my time..." comment.  Anyway, Friday should 
be cool so just go ahead and give me a call in the afternoon and we'll go 
from there.

First off I hope your still not at work when I send this.

Secondly it would be cool to meet earlier in the week but I'm in San Antonio
and will be until Friday.  I will be driving to Houston on Friday morning to
do some packing and then the parents will be coming up on Saturday morning
to help with the final move.  I will pretty much leave it in your ball park
about Friday night.  I know you have been working long hours and Friday is
just a bad day.  Even though I would like to see you, if you have a repeat
of last week then I understand if you want to call it off.  In that case
maybe we can meet up some other time.  Although I do remember a girl telling
me once that weekends are her time and she was going to go out no matter
what.

Let me know what you think and I'll probably give you a call Friday
afternoon to see how things are going.

Kyle
