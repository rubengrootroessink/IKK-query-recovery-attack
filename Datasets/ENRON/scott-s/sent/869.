The quote speaks to so many in such personal ways...Obviously you identified 
with it's message.  Although, I'm not sure about the Dalai Lama comment as he 
does believe in a power higher than himself.

As for myself...

I am still measuring my powers.  They seem to lie in such varied arenas that 
I never know what I will discover day-to-day.

As far as tasting the fruits of my passion, you know what they say...the 
first bite is the sweetest.  And I must say I look forward with great 
anticipation to sitting down at the table when the time is right.

My place in the world is a combination of one of the guys and the ever 
idealistic, eternal optimist (i.e. I see what is and yet still hold out hope 
for more).
 * I don't believe the sentiment in Return to Me was pure fiction.

Given all of this I am very happy.

world..wel nothing short then the next dalai Lama..

To be happy you must have taken the measure of your powers; tasted the fruits 
of your passion and learned your place in the world.

           -- George Santayana
