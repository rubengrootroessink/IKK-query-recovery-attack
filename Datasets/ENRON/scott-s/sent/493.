Hey Chris,

I was wondering if there was a fax number at the base so that my apartment 
complex can send you some info.  regarding getting your name taken off of our 
lease.  If there is, just shoot me off an email with the number and I'll pass 
it along to them.

Hope things are going well and that you're not too homesick with Thanksgiving 
and all.  I have a feeling I will be talking to you guys tomorrow along with 
both of our parents and extended family members.  Have a great holiday and 
root on the Horns ( I think this is going to be a tough one).

Love,
Susan
