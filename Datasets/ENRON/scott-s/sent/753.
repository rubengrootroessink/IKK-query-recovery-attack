Ted,

My day is going quite well, actually.  I managed to sleep in past 6:30 a.m. 
this morning and did not work-out so I'm feeling pretty good.  I'm not sure 
if I'll be able to respect you in the light of your "rule-breaking", but I'm 
going to try to look past that.  I'm heading to lunch right now - yes, I am 
actually leaving the building - so the day just keeps getting better and 
better.  As for last night, I had a really good time too and am glad you were 
able to look past my bad manners and agree to go out Friday.  Talk to you 
soon.

Susan

-- By the way, I'm very relieved to hear about the buckle.

Shorty,

I hope your day is going well and your trader and thus you are having a good 
day.  I just realized that I broke the "rules" last night.  I should say no 
to a Friday night out when asked out on Wednesday night but I'll let it go 
this time because we are going country and you are breaking out the t-shirt 
and jeans.  When I think about it, that exception applies to every 
situation.  I had fun last night and I think you will be relieved to know 
that I can't get my huge belt buckle on order and shipped in time for 
tomorrow so you are in the clear.

Ted
