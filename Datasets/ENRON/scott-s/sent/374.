Since every Saj is equal parts idealist and gambler, your relationship should 
be very interesting. 
You're great pals, marvelous traveling companions, a pair of high-flying, 
high-rolling 
activist/adventurers. Just come down to earth once in awhile -- or find 
someone else to 
do it for you. This union requires periodic reality checks. You share each 
others ideals, interests 
and adventures like no one else can. Both of you like to read, study, 
observe, learn and teach. 
When you're doing all those things together, life may get exhausting but 
never boring. 
Travel is part of the glue that holds you together. So here's a warning: 
Separate vacations 
are a no-no. Each of you is such a wanderer, somebody might not come back -- 
or remain at home.
