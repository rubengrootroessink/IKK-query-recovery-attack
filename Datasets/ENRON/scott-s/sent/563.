I would need a little more information to set this counterparty since I don't 
have access to Deal information. I would like the HQ address, contact person 
with the counterparty and a ph/fax number if you would please.

Attached is the process for getting access to GCP Change request system, this 
would allow an easier and a better turnaround on your future requests. In the 
mean time use the attached form to do any GCP requests...............Thanks!

Hi there !

For any new requests, a request must be submitted through the GCP Change 
Request System.  In the meantime, please email us the information and fax any 
supporting documentation you may have.

To receive access to the GCP Change Request System, each user must submit a 
SRRS request with the following instructions.    Once access has been 
completed, double click this doclink     to add the dbase to your 
workspace.     PLEASE DO NOT DELETE THIS EMAIL MESSAGE !!! 

If you need me to give you an overview of the system, please call me.

Thanks
