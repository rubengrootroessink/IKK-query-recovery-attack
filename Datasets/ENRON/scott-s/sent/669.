Thanks for the email.  Your candid comments make me wish I was over there 
right now sitting in a pub with you and Katy drinking a pint.  I am in full 
agreement that guys suck and have discovered through this situation an area 
in which 23 does not differ from 31...cowardess (As my Dad so eloquently put 
it, "He's just chicken-shit").  So, the plan of attack for the time being is 
none.  I am not going to do anything (that means no emails, no phone calls, 
no nothing).  Of course it's a lot easier to say that knowing he's in an 
entirely different state vs. two floors down from me, so next week will be 
the true test.  You will be happy to know, however, that I do have a good 
support system in Monique.  She is a firm advocate of the "drop him and make 
him work should he happen to come crawling back" school.  You know what 
really kills me though is the thought that, yet again, I will ultimately be 
disappointed by someone I truly expected more out of (I keep thinking about 
all the times I said "I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop." - well, 
it dropped) .  Anyway, I've have decided to throw myself into work, books, 
exercise, etc. in a effort to distract my mind from other things - it's kind 
of working.  

I'm really glad you are in enjoying things so much right now.  You have to 
email me back with more details regarding the new pad, like will there be 
enough room for me to crash there when I come to visit (if not, I'm sure Nick 
would put me up - scarey).  Also, I sent Katy an email about coming to visit 
so hopefully we can get everything squared away soon.  FYI:  The Longhorns 
beat Louisiana Lafayette 52-10 last Saturday (the game was fun, but extremely 
HOT!!!), it was a real nail biter.  
Talk to you soon,

Sue

*** Don't worry about me thinking any of this is in any way due to a 
shortcoming on my part.  I don't.  Rather, I am convinced he wasn't expecting 
the full package when we first went out and as soon as he realized that I 
was, he freaked.  I'm beginning to think it's more than just a coincidence 
that the last time we went out I let down one of the last walls I was holding 
up as far as trusting him and it was right after that that he started acting 
aloof. (Things that make you go hmmm.)
