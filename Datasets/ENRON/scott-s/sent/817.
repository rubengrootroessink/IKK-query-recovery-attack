Is it really so you can look at girls or so people can look at you?
  
  I think your right about everyone being able to beat anyone with one 
important caveat.  The individuals in question must be in the same strata.  I 
would not anticipate that an olympic medal winning long-distance runner could 
be beat by Joe Shmoe who runs every day at Memorial Park.  Of course if one 
is patient and bides their time they could probably stand a shot when the guy 
gets really old and slow.

Also, are you so bold as to suggest you've never lost?  Or do you not 
identify them as losses but rather the results of your own choosing?

well he was with her...his ugly...what the hell....
and i'm always up for a challenge and because i have alwyas been the under 
dog, my first true assumption is that everyone can beat anyone.
That's what i think inside, now what i show and tell is different...I don't 
lose and no you are not a the level that you could beat me...
