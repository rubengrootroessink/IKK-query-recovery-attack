Hi Mum!  The trip was pretty exhausting.  Friday we saw Hoover Dam, had lunch 
at a great diner in Kingman (on Route 66!) and rolled into Sedona around 5.  
Climbed around the red rocks of Sedona all day on Saturday, sat by the pool 
in the afternoon and I did some shopping.   Sunday we drove to Grand Canyon 
and did part of the Bright Angel trail.  That was pretty strenuous but 
definitely worth it.  Wish we could have made it a longer trip but we had 
Bill's trial schedule to deal with.  I'll spare you the details of my trip 
home -- suffice it to say I didn't make it back to Houston until about noon 
yesterday and have a $200 travel voucher for my trouble.

I will definitely come to Austin next weekend but probably will not get in 
until later on Saturday.  How about a homemade (by Chef Sooz) brunch on 
Sunday a.m.?

Have to run to a meeting ... for race info, I would try a search for Texaco 
or Texaco Gran(d?) Prix on the Internet.  I know that Texaco probably has it 
on their website.  If you don't find anything let me know.
Love,
Sooz

Hi, Sooz!

Hope you had a wonderful time in Ariz, saw all kinds of wonderful things, and
didn't fall into the Canyon and expire.  Hope you took a lot of photos.
Can't wait to hear all about it.

I had a good time with Grayson.  Jim and I fed her bottles Sat and Sun, and
she took them without a whimper.  Karin is feeling liberated!  I think she
wants to quit breastfeeding since she is having to pump at the office, and
everytime Grayson misses a feeding from her.  Jim is upset.  She has an ally
in Eric.  He says, men don't know when to stay out of something like that.
Anyway, Grayson is turning out to be a very happy baby.  Everytime you look
at her, she breaks out in a huge smile.

Are you coming next weekend?  K&J are and have made a couple of hc appts.
One is for 6:45 Fri which they fear they won't be able to make.

Trying to get some enthusiasm to pull out all the dead ground cover and plant
something else, but so far, can't seem to get the momentum.  Everything else
is looking pretty good with all our rains.  Except that the shrub people
raped the photinias by the street.  They say they should come back nicely.
We'll see.

Is there someplace you can find info about the car races in Sept?  Eric has a
free ticket he needs to use by Nov 15.  I don't know how this would work with
our CA trip planned for Oct. 3-17.  Had no problem getting a place to stay in
Carmel and we're working out from there.  We'll probably stay in Santa Cruz
about 4 nights so we can do some sailing.

Anxious to hear from you,  love, mum
