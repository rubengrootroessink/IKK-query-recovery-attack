The Pub code has been changed to IF-ELPO/SJ.  Sorry for the mix-up.

Susan,

Can you change the Pub code on deal ND1381 to IF-ELPO/SJ.  It is currently 
IF-ELPO/SANJUAN, which we don't currently use.  If the deal needs to stay 
booked as it is currently, let me know and We'll set up the language for this 
Index.

Thanks,
Joe
