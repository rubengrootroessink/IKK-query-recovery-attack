Subject: SW Gas - Again

Susan, I promise this will be the last time we go through this.  Attached is 
the draft letter.  I have added the words for the discount paragraph "for the 
term of the contract" as you requested.  Please provide the additional 
language for the paragragh regarding our retaining  revenues of capacity 
release above the discount level being subject to FERC approval, otherwise if 
not accepted by the FERC then not applicable. Thanks!
