Hey Handsome,

I am taking every step to ensure that I leave this building at a reasonable 
hour today.  Unfortunately, it is "bid-week" (Nat Gas trading thing which 
translates to beaucoup deals/trading) so the odds are somewhat stacked 
against me.  Anyway, I'm going to say that as it stands right now 8:00 p.m. 
is definitely do-able.  However, I do reserve the right to alter my estimate 
when we get closer to 4:30 p.m. and I have a better idea where I stand.  
Don't let them work you too hard down there...remember, your body's not used 
to it.

Susan

Hey Shorty,

How is your day going?  Hopefully, it is going well.  Let me know when you 
think you will be free tonight to go home, relax and then be ready to head 
out.  I will make the reservations accordingly.  I'll talk to you later.

Ted
