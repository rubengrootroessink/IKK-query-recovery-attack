Well, I have definitely taken a turn for the worse -- lots of drainage and 
coughing up green/yellow stuff.  No fever at all, though.  I go to the doctor 
tomorrow and hopefully will be on the road to recovery before Saturday.  

Received Jim's capilene shirts; they are nice.  But I wanted to double check 
with you to make sure I got the right ones -- he wanted the medium-weight 
ones that are sort of like long-sleeved t-shirts, right?  The reason I am 
asking is that Patagonia also makes a capilene that is more like a fleece 
fabric and comes in a v-neck style...

I will hold off on the bathtub spa for Mema.  The last thing I want to do is 
buy her something she does not need!  Will stick to my pedicure gift 
certificate idea.  

So glad you are doing better.  Too bad there was a delay in the flu vaccine 
this year or we both could have avoided a lot of trouble!

The doc thinks I probably had the flu.
