Hey Em,

Well it's 8:30 Friday night and surprise I'm still at the office.  I love 
this place!!!  To answer your question, yes I am definitely suffering 
withdrawal.  I will be working very hard over the next few months to cure 
that though.  Nothing really exciting to report here except A) Nick called me 
my first day back in the office to make sure I arrived home safely ( I really 
don't know what to do about all of that)  B) Ben keeps calling me to see if I 
want to go out - 2 nights in a row in addition to our Steak Night beer (I 
haven't gone either night).  How ironic is all of this?  I've got one guy 
worrying and thinking of me that I care nothing for...I've got another guy 
who I at one time cared for but no longer do trying to take advantage of my 
vulnerable state (which in truth isn't really vulnerable at all) and another 
guy, who I until fairly recently cared for, who I think could go the rest of 
his life without ever seeing/speaking to me again (Or course I guess the 
reverse of that is true as well).

Talk to you soon,
Susan

Positive notes:  I think Ted is getting greying and losing hair with the 
added stress of corn trading.  He looks old and pitiful.

oh, the wonders of technology.  here i am, 1000's of kilometers away,
communicating via email with you fabulous folks.  have just stumbled in from
a pub featuring an irish 'jig' band- i picked up the rhythem instantly, i
must admit.....and after only 12 pints!  needless to say, it was a brilliant
cultural experience, and the only thing that would've been better would've
been if all of you could have been there to a., mock and harass me, and b.,
make yourselves as hated as this american made herself....why is that cider
makes you want to sing show tunes and bitch about shitty english  washing
machines....?  anyways- just wanted you to know i was thinking of you- even
if it WAS  after i thought for 15 minutes where the closest burger king was
( *jen- this is as close as you're going to get to those ridiculous
miniature books w/ PMS quotes you're so fond of......how id boulder by the
way...?)  sue- glad you got home okay- going thru withdrawl yet?  matt- got
your emails- twice.  double thanks.  hope my biting response hasn't sent you
into therapy- yet.  kk, llkj,etc- hope all is well in lala land- just fyi- i
think red bull is cheaper here- imagine the possibilities!  and for the reat
of the gang- enjoy yourselves at the infamous cougar 5 yr- i will- OF
COURSE- be there in spirit.....and i'm not being cynical, really......
call/write soon, s'il vous plait......
