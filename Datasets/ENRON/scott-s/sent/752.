Ted,

I think you had, at one point, asked me if the first U.T. football game was 
Labor Day weekend.  It is actually the weekend after Labor Day (Sept. 9) 
against Louisiana-Lafayette at 11:30 a.m.  So basically it should be a very 
challenging game and relatively cool (Ha!).  Hope your day's going well.

Shorty

FYI - U.T. plays Stanford at Stanford Sept. 16 (7:15 p.m. kick-off)
