We have a meeting scheduled Thursday, March 23 from 11:00 a.m. until 1:00 
p.m. in 4194 regarding Order 637 issues related to imbalances.  It is not 
mandatory for everyone in TW Commercial to attend, but let me know ASAP if 
you will be attending so I can order lunch.  

Thanks,

Janet - ext. 31540
