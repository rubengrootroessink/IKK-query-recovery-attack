          > >Her next thought was:
          > >Don't be a bigot, they look like perfectly nice
          gentlemen.
          > >
          > >But racial stereotypes are powerful, and fear immobilized
          her.
          > >She stood and stared at the two men.
          > >She felt anxious, flustered, and ashamed.

          will
          > >she picked up one foot and stepped forward and followed

          > >of the men said, "Hit the floor."
