Here is a draft that incorporates Drew's, Steve Stojic's, Maria's and some of 
Shelley's comments (Shelley hasn't gotten all the way thru the draft yet).  

Please take a look at the draft and let me know if you have comments today.  
Still working on justifying transporter options, as you can see on page 5.  

If possible I'd like to send it to Nancy to file today.

Thanks,
Susan
