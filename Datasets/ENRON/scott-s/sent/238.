Hey!  I think I'm planning to come to Austin sometime on Sat.  Bill won't be 
coming with me because he has 3 trial settings on July 3, what a drag.  I 
will probably go home on Mon. afternoon.  Our friends are having their lake 
house party on the 4th.  Tell Jim to bring his gear and we'll go hit some.   
Can't wait to see Gbug!  You know Mema is going to be really excited to see 
her eat carrots.  (I think she's coming in on Sunday.)

I was regressing yesterday and found this website, which I think you would 
appreciate also:

See you soon!

Hi! Fancy hearing from ME! Just checking in to see what your weekend plans
are like when will you be in Austin? Are you bringing Bill? Do you want to
play tennis w/ Jim, etc!  Jim has an appointment to get his fro -glo going
at 12 on Saturday, so we will be hitting Austin that morning and will
probably stay through Sun. evening or possibly Monday morning. They have
decided to give us Monday off, but we still need to get things done around
the house, so we can't loll around in Austin the WHOLE time! Do you know
when Mema will be there? You know, one of these days you are going to get
stuck driving her to Austin! Let me know what's going on! Gbug wants to show
you how she likes to eat her carrots! Mmmmm! And she wants to try out her
boat in the pool.

Bye!
Karin
