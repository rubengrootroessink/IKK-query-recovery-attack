You're the greatest.  

I think Little Woodrow's is on for tonight although I'm still waiting to see 
if my brother and his wife want to go out tonight (he leaves for South Korea 
Sunday), if they're a no go I will be on the deck with a bucket of beer.  

P.S. You are in peak physical condition.

i believe that in the spychology of things and oneself, a person never has to 
lose, and can always win somehow and in someway...
I have made very big sacrifices and have done some rather "not Nice" 
things...to win
True i have not often lost...losing is a frame of mind and a way of thinking, 
the question is, have i always been the best i could be and on that end, 
well....Yeah i rarely lose...i don't see why one would want to.
But i have been beaten by people even when i gave my best in sports mainly 
and then their are always smarter people..so
it's relative...
Ture i am the most looked at guy at memorial park, and i can't figure out if 
i actually enjoy it or not, because i know my true self, and the reality..i 
have no friends, and i go to bed by myself everynight...i'm a very lonely 
person at heart and in my head, and well beside Shannon
most girls i have dated, though pretty, are not hotties, but rather have a 
lot of charme and personality..and 
oh more more honest coment, i don't actually have an opinion on my looks...i 
don't really care....(but i do know about my body! and yeah few come close)
there
