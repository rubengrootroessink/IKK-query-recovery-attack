Okay, there's a flight out of Houston on the 15th that gets into SD at 10:45 
pm and the return flight is on Sunday around 3:30.  If that works for you I'm 
going to go ahead and book the ticket now.  

I'm so glad to hear that you're move was such a rousing success.  As for 
myself and all of the guy juggling, I'm trying to get that under control.  
Truth be told, none of them are worth a dime.  I think it was more of an ego 
thing on my part.  Anyway, I still can't see the point in wasting time on 
guys I'm not interested in so (like I said) I've ceased the rampage.  I'm not 
taking any time off for Christmas so this trip would be a very welcomed 
respite.

Let me know about the times.

Susan
