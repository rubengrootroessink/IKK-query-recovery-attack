The post-id should be 766556.  I am still inputting the unofficial post-id on 
a daily basis in that file that was created for you all, 
O:\Erms\erms_adm\GasDaily\GDailyDrop.  Let me know if there's anything else I 
can do.

Hi Purvi.

Sorry to only come to you when I have a problem, but I've noticed a large 
increase in the number of Gas Daily Deals that fail to pull into our 
Reporting Database.  Could you tell me which Post ID these deals are in and 
when they were booked?  I would really appreciate your help.



Thanks for your help,

Carrie
