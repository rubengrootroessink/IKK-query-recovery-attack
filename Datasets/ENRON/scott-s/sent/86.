Hi Lindy.  Sorry I've not yet set up the meeting on imbalances...I feel I am 
still lacking focus so thought I'd run this by you for your comments before 
inviting people.   
 
First of all, I believe the general topics we wanted to address were:

- imbalance netting & trading
- mandatory use of Park N Ride service for out of balance operators
- hourly determination of imbalances

Is this correct?

Next, the list of attendees:  you, me, Darrell, Richard Hanagriff, Sheila 
Nacey (or someone else she designates).  Anyone else?

As far as timing, I am very flexible, so let me know what works for you, and 
I'll get it set up.
