Sorry I never called yesterday...I had turned my phone off and didn't realize 
you'd called until last night.  I'm still at work right now and therefore am 
extremely tired.  Hope you got everything you needed to accomplished this 
weekend.  I had a good time at the game and, thanks to Travis's pledge class 
reunion, have come to the conclusion that 27-28 is a better age range for 
me.  There young enough to excuse being single due to career focus and still 
old enough to know who they are and what they want.  Some critical things 
happen in those 3-5 years from a man's late twenties to early thirties that 
can expose so many "issues" (examples of which I got to see several of on 
Saturday).

Talk to you soon,
Susan

Are you and Doug going to OU?
