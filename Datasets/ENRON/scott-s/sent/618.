Alas, there is no point to steak night without Kori or myself.  There is good 
cause for your lack of enthusiasm.  

Tomorrow morning sounds good to me for a coffee/steamed almond milk break.  
How 'bout we shoot for around 9:30 (although I can do earlier or later if 
need be).  Let me know.

As for the week after next, anything from Wednesday night on will work for 
me.  I am in full agreement with you regarding a "solid dinner" (of limited 
attendance of course).

See you tomorrow,

Susan

 - - Funny thing, Ben called earlier to see if I wanted to go grab lunch with 
him (Does he think I'm in a vulnerable/weakened state due to the Ted 
situation?  Well, he's wrong.)

What's the point of living if I am not going to steak night with you?! 
Seriously, if you nor Kori and the like aren't going, I think I will go to a 
genuine steak house. :)
Let me know how your morning is looking tomorrow for coffee---or in my case 
steamed almond milk? Let me know. I will be here through Friday morning--must 
get back to P-Town for a little reprieve. By-the-way, not next week but the 
following week I will be back. We really need to do dinner and do a thorough 
debriefing and have a solid dinner. Enough of this "15- person, let's talk 
over smoke and voices" thing. I think I am getting old.

Yes, we still do the steak night thing, but I will be unable to attend this 
evening (dinner with the traders, oh la la!).  You may want to talk to bfree 
and see if he or Economou are planning on an outing.  

So when are we going to have a chance to chat?
