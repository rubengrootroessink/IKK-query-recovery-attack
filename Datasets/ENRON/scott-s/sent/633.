Sorry I didn't respond very promptly to your last email.  Things have been 
very emotionally draining for me around here.  I'm going to forward some of 
my recent email communications to catch you up on the issue.  After you've 
had a chance to take in the situation I would really love to hear your 
opinion.  Call or email with any insights.

Susan

Subject: We have closure! (well, sort-of)

I'm soooo good.  The chosen path was cool, indifference.  

So, last night was Steak Night and with Nick and Wilson both in town we had a 
really good showing.  I got there about 7:30 with Nick, and the group's size 
swelled to about 12+ by 8:30 - 9:00.  About 8:00 I saw Kevin (Ted's pal - the 
one you meet a steak night) wandering around LW's obviously in search of 
someone.  Can you believe it?  He (Ted) knew I had organized this gathering - 
I know that because Nick is working right across from he and Darren and 
overheard Darren encouraging Ted's attendance (mind you Ted was not in the 
email distribution) - and he had the nerve to come.  Anyway, Kevin saw me and 
came over to chat.  He informed me that "our friend Ted should be there 
shortly" to which I responded, "You would know better than me at this 
point".  The subject was dropped until he felt the need to raise it again.  
He asked if Ted and I parted on good terms/ bad terms, etc.  I said there 
really weren't any terms, I just hadn't heard a peep out of him for about 2 
weeks.  Kevin wanted to know if I was going to break a bottle over Ted's head 
and cause a big scene.  When I said no, I think he was genuinely 
disappointed.  I said in order for me to do something like that I would have 
to care about the "loss" and that, while a week or two earlier I might have 
cared a bit more, with each passing day the "loss" seems less and less like 
much of a loss.  Kevin told me I was better-off without Ted.  To go even 
further, he informed me that there is no way he would ever let a daughter of 
his date Ted nor any of his "girl-friends".  He said that while he thought 
Ted was a great guy (i.e. fun to be around, good stories, etc.) he wasn't 
good dating material.  I agreed with Kevin saying "Ted is a great guy, he 
just makes a lousy man" (don't you like that one?).  I then went on to say 
"Anyway, I'm destined for bigger and better things, right?".  Kevin: "Much 
bigger and much better."  About this time my parents showed up...the plot 
thickens.  I introduced Kevin to my parents and since both my Dad and Kevin 
were in the Navy and attended Colorado they had much to talk about.  The two 
of them had probably been talking for about half an hour when 
"dum-da-dum-dum" Ted shows up.  He approaches our group because he sees Kevin 
and is forced to make eye-contact with me.  I give him a "hey" and he gives 
me the arm squeeze and a much too pleasant "how's it going?".  He asked what 
Kevin and my Dad were talking about, I told him the Navy, he said don't get 
Kevin started or you'll never shut him up...Then he walked away.  He never 
acknowledged my parents nor did he ever speak to me again the rest of the 
evening.  The beautiful thing is Kevin stays and talks with my Dad for 
another half hour and when Darren shows up he hangs out with "my group" for 
quite a while before going to join Ted.  My parents and I ate our steaks 
right behind Ted and then went back over to our group at the picnic table 
when we were finished.  It really was a great night.  I would almost say I 
was glowing (I was having so much fun with my friends and family and it 
wasn't a show for Ted's benefit...I really was having a great time).  So, 
when my parents decide to head out they walked over to Ted/Kevin's table to 
say good-bye to Kevin.  It was awesome.  Ted's sitting right next to Kevin 
while Kevin and my Dad are talking and appears to be actually shrinking in 
his chair.  Yet again no acknowledgement of my parents - he couldn't even 
make eye-contact.  I ended up staying there for at least another hour and 
then went with a few of the guys to the Ale House.  Needless to say I was 
very hung over today.  Anyway, there's the story...He's a complete and utter 
ass-hole.  So I'm done.  And no, there is no way he could weasel his way back 
in to my good graces.  

Now on to a fun subject, my trip to London.  I bought my ticket today ( I 
think I got hosed a little bit, but it was the cheapest ticket I could find - 
$450 before taxes).  I will arrive at Heathrow airport around 7:00 a.m. 
Friday the 6th and depart about 11:00 a.m. on Tuesday the 10th.  I'm very 
excited about the trip, I really need to get out of Houston.  I leave the 
activities in your capable hands.  ( bear in mind I will have to see Darren 
and Nick at some point).

"Single again" Sue


Bear in mind this next email wasn't sent until Friday afternoon (a full day 
and a half after the Steak Night debacle).

I am refraining from responding to this until I have had time to ponder 
things this weekend.

Hey,

I apologize for being out of touch recently but I was on vacation last week 
and this week has been busy.  Things seemed a bit awkward recently and I 
would like to see if we could get a beer and chat next week if you are free 
(after Tuesday night because I'll be in Amarillo talking to feedlot operators 
early next week). Enjoy your weekend and my condolences about UT's fall out 
of the top 10.

Ted


I haven't contacted him yet...what do you think?
