Ashley, all that is fine, and I certainly understand, though I would very 
much hate to lose you because you are a fabulous renter.  Keep your freedom!  
Stay in my apartment!!  If you do not want to renew for 6 months and want to 
go month to month after Nov., that is fine.  All I ask is 30 days notice 
before you move out.  In any event, I'll probably get the floors done just 
because I think it would be a good improvement to make regardless...I'll 
check with you before I get the work done to make sure the timing is OK with 
you.

Susan,

Before you spend too much making improvements (though the oven does need to be
fixed!)

Right now, it looks like Deron is not going to be moving in with me as he has
some concerns about the wiring for all of his computer gadgets.

I love my (your!) garage apartment and really do not want to give it up, 
however
I am not sure if it makes sense for us to keep paying 2 rents, so I am not 
100%
sure whether I will be renewing my lease after November.  If I did, it would
probably be for another six months (ie, I would delay moving in together, 
which
I am considering as there is no real reason to rush).

If I do not, I would be happy to post an ad for it here at Hewitt as I have
nothing but nice things to say about it and you!  Plus, one would be very
hard-pressed to find an irresponsible person here- there are lots of wonderful
people here.   I will try to make a decision by the end of Sept. as to give 
you
notice and enough time to try to help you find a nice tenant!

I am sorry to seem to fickle-  life is suddenly getting very complicated!

ashley

Ashley, the oven/stove problem should be fixed before the weekend.  If you
have any further problems with it please let me know; I realize it's pretty
old.  I never noticed the control for the oven doesn't even have
temperatures marked on it...the repairman is definitely taking care of that
too!  The handy dudes are coming over to give me an estimate on the kitchen
and bathroom floors and I'm going to also ask them to replace the wood
around the A/C in the second bedroom.  If there's anything else you've
noticed that needs fixing let me know.
