I definitely want to renew, but as you know I never get home before the 
leasing office closes.  I've got paintball Saturday morning but I know that 
won't take all day so maybe I can go by in the afternoon to sign any 
necessary papers.  My guess is you'll need to sign some papers as well.

Sue,

We had a message from the apt. office about renewing our lease. If we renew 
we can get our carpet cleaned for free, I THINK?  Let me know if you need me 
to do anything.  They have been sending you the renewal notices and leaving 
you the messages, so I am not sure if you need to instigate it.

let me know

lisa
