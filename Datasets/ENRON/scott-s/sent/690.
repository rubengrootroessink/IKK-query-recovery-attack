Em,

I cannot believe you ran into Ben Affleck!!!  I'm sure it's just the first of 
many celebrity sightings you will have in Jolly Old England.  I had an 
absolutely incredible time in San Diego with Julie.  We went to the beach 
(where I was able to lay-out and not sweat!), shopped a ton, attended the 
symphony and got messages.  All in all it was an extremely relaxing weekend.  
Yesterday, I was in Austin for a recruiting trip and got to see Corey's new 
house in Hyde Park - very cute.  

So I got back to work today, Wednesday, and still no word from Mr. Noble.  
Just to refresh, the last time I heard from him (email) was Thursday 
morning.  You'd be proud of me though as I have refrained from any form of 
contact and plan to continue that route only deviating if/when it becomes 
necessary for me to have a formal close to things.  I'm still hoping that 
will not be the case but am fully prepared for the possibility that my brief 
encounter with dating may be over for a while.

Sue
