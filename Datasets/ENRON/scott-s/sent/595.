Agustin, 

I haven't booked the origination we talked about yet because I wanted to get 
an exact number from you first.  If you could send me an email with the 
correct origination amount I can book it tonight.  The deal was with General 
de Cermica for 11,000/month 10/1/00 - 03/31/0.

Thanks,
Susan
