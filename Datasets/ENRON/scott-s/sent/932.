                                                      "The Ten Commandments 
of a Military Wife" 

                              1.Thou shalt not write in ink in thy address 
book.

other uniformed braches of service.

spendeth a night with them while enroute to a new post/base. 

                              8.Be kind and gentle to retired, white-haired 
Exchange and Commissary customers, because thou too will
                              be a retiree someday. 

                              9.Thou shalt not curse thy husband when he's on 
TDY on moving day. 

                              10.Thou must never arrive at a new post/base 
and constantly brag about how everything was much better
                              at the last post/base.

                          Shit: Through the eyes of the Military

                              *An Army grunt stands in the rain with a 35 
pound pack on his back, 15 lb. weapon in hand, after having
                              marched 12 miles, and says, "This is shit!"

                              *An Army Airborne Ranger stands in the rain 
with a 45 lb. pack on his back, weapon in hand, after having
                              jumped from an airplane and marched 18 miles, 
and says with a smile, "This is good shit!" 

                              *A Navy SEAL lies in the mud, 55 LB pack on his 
back, weapon in hand, after swimming 10 miles to shore,
                              crawling through a swamp and marching 25 miles 
at night past the enemy positions, says with a grin, "This
                              really is great shit."

                              *A Marine, up to his nose in the stinking, 
bug-infested mud of a swamp with a 65 LB pack on his back and
                              a weapon in both hands after jumping from an 
aircraft at high altitude, into the ocean, swimming 12 miles to
                              the shore, killing several alligators to enter 
the swamp, then crawling 30 miles through the brush to assault
                              an enemy camp, says, "I love this shit." 

                              *The Air Force NCO sits in an easy chair in an 
air conditioned, carpeted office and says, "My e-mail's
                              out? What kind of shit is this?"

                              1. A Private saying, "I learned this in basic 
training..." 
                              2. A Sergeant saying, "Trust me, sir..." 
                              3. A Second Lieutenant saying, "Based on my 
experience..." 
                              4. A Captain saying, "I was just thinking..."
                              5. And a Warrant Officer chuckling, "Watch this 
$%!#..."
