No one has ever mistaken me for being a shy or timid person...least of all 
Ted.  Therefore, telling him about the shirt was right in character for me.  
I think a part of him probably felt a little ashamed that a 23 yr. old girl 
with almost no dating experience could handle the situation with more class 
than him.  Anyway, there were a few other things established and solidified 
last night by Ted - 1. By his own admission, I am definitely smarted than him 
(while in the past I have challenged that I had to agree last night) 2. I am 
a confident, probably too much so, and well-adjusted individual.  Merely 
taking into account those two points, Ted in his present "condition" could 
never be a match for me.  I would either always feel like I was carrying him 
or rolling over him.  I'm still absolutely floored by the fact I have now 
dated a divorcee.  Does Chuck think less of me for being duped?  I hope 
not...he really seemed like a good (to everyone that met him).

I think Mom, Dad and I are all going to fly over on the same flight 
(Singapore Airlines).  I found a great deal from San Francisco for around 
$580.  I of course will have to fly from Houston which ups the fare to $800, 
but it's still the best deal around.  I can't wait to see you guys.
