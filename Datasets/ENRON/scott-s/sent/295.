Denise, here are a few things off the top of my head.

1.  I mostly work for the Transwestern Commercial Group, which is the 
following cast of characters:

Steve Harris
Kevin Hyatt
Lindy Donoho
Jeff Fawcett
TK Lohman
Christine Stokes
Michelle Lokay
Lorraine Lindberg

When I am not on 47, I sit near their work area on 41 (and forward my phone 
to x34516).  These are the people I'm most likely to have you organize 
meetings with, distribute things to, etc.  Their assistant is Audrey 
Robertson.  I lost our most recent phone list but please get one from her 
(x35849).

2.  Usually I get in around 8:30 and leave around 6.  I'm not picky about 
when you're in the office; it is very rare that I will need you to come in 
early or stay late.  I think I asked Janet only twice.

3.  Major projects I'm working on right now that you'll hear me mention a lot:

- TW Options (a tariff filing)
- Order 637 compliance
- Caithness/Big Sandy (potential pipeline interconnect)

4.  Standing meetings:

- TW Commercial Group staff meeting:  Monday at 9:30
- Omaha regulatory staff meeting:  Tues. at 8:15.
- Therapist:  every few weeks Thurs. 9:00 (if anyone asks, I'm in a meeting; 
but if they knew where I really was I'm sure they would understand!)

5.  Faxes:  I get faxes from Regulatory a lot and they generally don't call 
first.  Please check the fax machine once a day (and my chair, if I'm not on 
47 that day, in case someone got a fax for me and put it there).

6.  Mail:  Please open my mail, and I'll try to come pick it up every day.

7.  Filing:  I generally avoid keeping files of useless information.  
However, since I'm a regulatory lawyer it is inevitable that I will have a 
ton of paper to stash away where I can find it later.  Filing is pretty 
important to me.  I promise to try to let you know what files are more 
important than others so you can prioritize.  The good news:  I rarely ever 
go to the extent where I would have you index a file.  Just putting things in 
the right folder is enough.

8.  Computer files:  At the beginning of each quarter, please create a new 
Word file folder (if you look under sscott you'll see I have 2ndqtr00, 
3rdqtr00, etc.)

9.  Calendar:  Please obtain access to my Lotus Organizer, and if you get 
e-mails of meetings I'm supposed to attend go ahead and put them in the 
calendar. 

10.  Friends you're likely to hear from a lot:  Ann, Bill, my grandmother 
("Ms. Savoy"), Dianna

11.  The Other Susan Scott:  There is a Susan M Scott who works for ENA.  I 
get her mail and phone calls all the time!  Her extension is 31445.  Not sure 
of her location as it seems to change a lot.

I look forward very much to working with you!!
