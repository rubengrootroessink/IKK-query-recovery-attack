Aurora, I do not think we have estimated the costs for 2000 because what we 
will have to do as far as containment of PCBs this year is the subject of 
some dispute.  I will get you a breakdown of 1999 costs as soon as possible.

Subject: PCB costs incurred (Notes to Browncover Section 7

Susan:

AA auditor reviewed our footnotes to our browncover for TW (Section 7 - 
Litigation and Contingencies) and was asking for some information regarding 
the following paragraph:

Transwestern incurred and continues to incur certain costs related to 
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) that migrated into one of its customer's 
facilities through use of a PCB-based lubricant.  Because of the continued 
detection of PCBs near Transwestern's Topock station, Transwestern continues 
to take measures to contain the PCB at an estimated cost of $2.3 million in 
1998 and an estimated $5.4 million in 1999.

Here are the AA's questions:

1) Can you please provide the actual cost for 1999 and the estimated cost for 
2000

2)  Also, if you have a copy of where these costs are coming from so AA can 
tie their figures

Can you please provide this information today as AA wants to wrap up the 
notes.  Please call me if you have any questions.  Thanks again for your help.


Aurora
