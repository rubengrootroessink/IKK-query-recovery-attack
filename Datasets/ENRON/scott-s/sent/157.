Subject: Gallup - Status Update, May 4,  AM

The suction strainer was removed last night.  The piping spool was=20
reinstalled without the major compressor alignment problems that were=20
expected.  This significantly reduced the downtime necessary for the remova=
l=20
of the suction strainer.

No major foreign materials were found in the strainer.  Some small weld bea=
ds=20
were found.  There were some signs that the strainer may have been vibratin=
g.

Several compressor test runs were made early this AM to measure the vibrati=
on=20
levels without the suction strainer.  The high frequency vibration was=20
reduced to safe levels.  There is no longer any risk to the unit piping=20
integrity.

The compressor bearing vibration did not decrease due to the removal of the=
=20
strainer.  Rolls will continue to assess the collected vibration data to=20
determine the cause of the high drive end bearing vibration and construct a=
=20
game plan.

The station once again became available for service around 4 AM.  The=20
compressor may or may not be run dependent on need.  Gallup Ops and Gas=20
Control are in close contact.

The station will be manned if the compressor is running due to Gas Control=
=20
being unable to send remote setpoints to the station controller.  The probl=
em=20
stems from OPTO-22 not supporting the particular Modbus function required t=
o=20
send setpoints.  This is a =01+lack of functionality=01, in the new LCM4 ve=
rsion=20
controllers/software utilized on the Gallup Project. =20

EECC has been in contact with OPTO-22 to determine the time table for=20
resolving this problem.  EECC, TW Ops are working on a temporary fix to=20
enable Gas Control to send remote setpoints to Gallup.  Gas Control is=20
currently able to monitor data from Gallup.

Some instrumentation will be replaced today that failed due to the high=20
vibration over the fast few days.

Final tuning of the station control loops and surge control will be also be=
=20
conducted today.
