Lexi,

I completely forgot to turn in my expense report from last months recruiting 
trip.  Things around here have been absolutely crazy, as I'm sure they have 
been for you.  In addition to the attached file below I am forwarding the 
hard copy to your office.  Let me know if there is anything else I can do to 
help with the process.



Thanks,
Susan
