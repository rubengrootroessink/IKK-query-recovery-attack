As you will note from the email address, my last name is Scott.  If that is 
not enough information to derive my number I will have to question the level 
of intelligence I had previously afforded you.  However, as I hate having my 
illusions shattered, I'll save myself from possible disappointment and just 
give you the number...ext. 31455.

Please don't think less of me as a person, but this really made me laugh.
