Jessica,

I'm sorry I never got in touch with you last weekend, but I had the wrong 
phone number with me and didn't have enough brain power to think of using 
Information.  I don't think I would have been much fun anyway since I pretty 
much just ended up sleeping the whole weekend.  In fact, I fell asleep in the 
car on the ride back to my sister's house after the game and my parents 
decided to just leave me in the car.  I think I was probably out there for an 
hour before I woke up (needless to say I was very confused).  Anyway, hope 
things are going well for you and Clay.  I know everything must be kind of 
crazy for both of you right now with finals coming up and all of the 
interviewing you've both no doubt been doing. 

I really want to get a chance to see you and chat...I don't feel like we've 
had a good one in forever.  I will be in Austin over Thanksgiving for the 
game, so we could try to touch base then if you're going to be in town.  If 
not, I'm sure I can manage at least one weekend trip during December if 
there's a good weekend for you.  Just drop me  a line when you get a chance 
and let me know what's new with you.  

Susan

Susie-just wanted to say hello and see how your trip went!!  Hope you had a
ball.  Also, I wanted to let you know that Clay and I are having family and
friends over for food and beer after the game this weekend and would love to
see you.  We are at 1810 Palma Plaza--if you take Enfield towards Mopac, take
a left at the light at Hartford, take a right on Palma Plaza, we are the last
(blue) duplex on the right before Mopac; our half faces Palma Plaza and the
other half faces Mopac.  If you forget these directions--my number is
512-322-0692.

Jessica
