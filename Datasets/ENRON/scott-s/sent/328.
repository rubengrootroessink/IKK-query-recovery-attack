Ted, I made a slight change on the first page.  Also, the blanks of course 
need to be filled in for $$ amount and term.
Do we have other guaranties in favor of both TW and NNG?  I know we probably 
do, and I may have even approved them.  But if possible I'd prefer to have 
two separate guaranties since TW and NNG are separate legal entities.  It is 
not a huge concern, since we are not jointly obligating the two companies to 
do anything.  If it would cause an administrative hassle to have two 
agreements, let me know.

Susan,

 Can you take a look at the attached guaranty from BP Amoco.  Please give me 
your comments or approval at your earliest convenience.

 Additionally, are you still going to Zihuatanejo, Mexico?


Thanks,
Ted
