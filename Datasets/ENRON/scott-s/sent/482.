Actually, if you don't expect me to keep up with you the whole 8K's, I could 
probably muster up the energy.  Besides, I'm planning on sleeping the entire 
way out there so I'll end up getting more sleep that night than normal.  Do I 
need to do anything to sign up for the run?

any chance you'd be up for an 8K run on saturday?? only problem is that it 
starts at 8:00am- too painful after your late night?? no obligation.....

Okay...My itinerary is as follows:? Arriving in San Diego 2:20 am Friday
night (I'll need your new address for the cab) and departing Sunday at 6:15
pm.? If you just want to leave the key under the mat that would be perfect
for me...I'll probably crash immediately anyway.? I am so excited to be
coming out there - -? I really need a break from Houston...not to mention
work.? The Gas Lamp district Saturday night sounds like fun and I would
love to meet your friends.? Also, please don't feel like you have to plan
the whole weekend, I have no problem going with the flow.

See you in a couple of weeks,
Susan
