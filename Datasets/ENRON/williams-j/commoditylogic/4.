Doug,

Another example of the "data integrity" issues Bill and I referred to 
previously.  Before setting up either of the CrossTimbers companies, we would 
expect and recommend a thorough review of the booking of their existing 
trades, from TAGG deal entry through Sitara/CPR and Unify.

Regards,
Debbie

Please Consider Cross Timbers Oil Company for CL application

Also, for our information, both Cross Timbers Oil Company and Cross Timbers 
Energy Services have transactions booked on our systems.

Cross Timbers Oil Company
Prior Month's Gas (Early Pay)             $6,505,113.57  
Current Month's Gas (Pre-Pay)         $14,506,601.59  
Contracted Future Gas Delivery       $93,851,244.49  

Cross Timbers Energy Services
Prior Month's Gas (Early Pay)              $636,838.74  
Current Month's Gas (Pre-Pay)            $228,130.60  
Contracted Future Gas Delivery                        -0-

Are the deals with CTES booked incorrectly?    The numbers for prior month 
are coming from Unify, and the current month are coming from CPR

Please direct approval requests through Jay  Williams and copy Debbie and I.  

Southwest Royalties should be rejected due to credit quality and Cross 
Timbers Energy Services, Inc. should not be approved but we would be willing 
to consider Cross Timbers Oil Company.  All purchases should be directly with 
Cross Timbers Oil Company with no transactions with Energy Services.
