If anything, life sucks worse.  There is a guy
retiring today and I'm basically supposed to replace
him on this project, but I've been so busy with other
projects that I haven't had any time to pick his
brain.  So I am fucked but large.

Send the package to the office.  Our secretaries don't
do shit for me ever, so they can at least lug my
gifts around.

This weekend isn't good for a chat, unfortunately.
I leave for Boston tonight and T and I might go
skiing.
This is the last time I'll see her until after Vegas,
since she leaves for India on Tuesday and I leave
for my 6 week sojourn after that.  So I plan to get
very acquainted with my right hand.  Maybe I'll have
time to acquire some skill with my left.

I may very seriously blow my brains out while we're in
Vegas.  I saw Fight Club yet again last night and
shooting himself in the head seemed to work for Ed
Norton.  One thing is for sure, there is definitely
no downside to shooting yourself in the head.  Unless
you paralyze yourself or something.  That's the thing
about life.  As awful as it is, it can always be
worse.  In my case, losing the ability to terminate
myself at any time would be the worst thing ever.

Its raining today, also.
