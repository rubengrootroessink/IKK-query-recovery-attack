Rod The Bod -

Hey, dude.  I need some help digging up some financial info on a new trading 
counterparty.  I prepared an ISDA draft about two months ago for FleetBoston 
Financial Group, the mega-huge, mega-powerful awesome credit banking 
company.  Tana Jones called me last week to inform me that they DIDN'T want 
to trade out of this entity but instead out of Fleet National Bank, which is 
a wholly-owned subsidiary.
