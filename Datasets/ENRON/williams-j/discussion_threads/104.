Juan -

G'Day.  Hey, mate, I got a call from Mike Midden at ANZ Bank, looking for a 
guaranty from Enron Corp. for FX trading of Enron Japan.  He said that YOU 
had given him MY name as the contact for this in your absence.  Imagine my 
surprise when he asked for the status!!!!  Boy, that was THE BEST.  I told 
him that you had been fired and I was hot on your heels to the unemployment 
office and not to put any faith in either of us.

He didn't think it was too funny.

In any case, what IS the deal with this guarantee?  What are you doing on 
this, John?  Tell me!!!!
