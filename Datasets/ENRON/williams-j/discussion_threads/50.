Doug - 

Pursuant to the strict written instructions I have received from Credit, and 
in accordance with our standing policy, we will not be issueing the User ID 
and Welcome Letter to Tenaska until AFTER Credit approval has been granted.

That being said however, we understand the sense of urgency, and have:

1) verified the authority of the User
2) created the User ID and Welcome Letter
3) prepared same for mailing
4) confirmed with the Mail Room that overnight delivery will have the package 
to the customer by 10am next day.

So, you can assured that there will be ABSOLUTELY NO DELAY on the behalf of 
PCG once we have received the appropriate credit approval.

Dale

Sorry guys - I inadvertently hit send without the following comment.  You can 
delete the previous version of this.

Based on my conversation with Debbie this morning, we can send it out today.  
If we do this, there is a better chance they will have a chance to look at 
the site on Thursday late afternoon before actually transacting.

"Tentatively approved" means that we should assume that Tenaska will be 
granted full approval unless we hear otherwise from Debbie, Bill, or Jason 
Williams by COB Thursday.  

Please mail the letter and UserID out to Tenaska today.   I have set up the 
counterparty in CL system with appropriate interest rates and privileges, and 
you guys in PCG should set up the user as usual in the CL system.  

I really appreciate everyone's speed on this issue;  I believe that there is 
a good chance Tenaska will want to transact on Friday.  I told them the 
earliest they would be able to do so was Friday, pending our usual setup 
processes and credit check.

thanks again!

Debbie - 

Does 'tentatively approved' mean that we should not grant Tenaska access 
until we hear from you tomorrow?

been approved for "view" access only.

Please reply to confirm, and I will process accordingly.
