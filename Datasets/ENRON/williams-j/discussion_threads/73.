Andrew -

Thanks for your kind words, my friend.  Your thoughtfulness has added 
immeasurable joy to my already immeasurably joyous day.  Indeed, I would say 
that this is the Greatest Day of My Life except that I know tomorrow will be 
even better.  Your contentment, nay I say your unbridled happiness is just 
another reason why I am at peace with all the world.

Hello, my friend Jay W.

I just wanted to say what a great day I am having.  I
am at peace with my surroundings and getting up to go
to work is the highlight of every day, because it
interrupts the nagging sleep that cuts into work time.
I have a constant smile and my cheerfullness is
rubbing off on others.  We are all a happy family.  I
am sure that your life is the same.  I hope that I can
live to be 200 years old and that I am allowed to work
that long, because every second at the office is an
eternity of serene enlightenment.

God Bless you, friend, and peace be with you.

-andy
