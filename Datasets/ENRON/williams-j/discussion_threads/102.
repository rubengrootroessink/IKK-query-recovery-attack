TNgo -

A bit of a gray area.  There are SOME credit terms in the ISDA draft, but no 
collateral threshold.  You'll have to sell this to Fuller to collect on your 
wine...



Always Here For You, TNgo,

Jay

Tana -

Attached is the ISDA worksheet for Clark County, Washington.  You will note 
that this worksheet indicates no collateral threshold, as Clark County is a 
counterparty that will require a contract where we maintain no collateral 
rights.  NOTE TO TRACY AND DAVE:  If you feel like we can get Clark County 
PUD to agree to margin rights, then we should (obviously) try to put a draft 
in front of them with a threshold and margin rights.  Please let me know your 
thoughts on this issue.


Thanks,

Jay
