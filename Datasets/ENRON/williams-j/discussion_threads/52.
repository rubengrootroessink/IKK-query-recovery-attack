Tanya -

An update on National Steel Corporation:  the unwind/monetization deal was 
closed today with this counterparty.  I am still trying to get details, but 
it is my impression that we wrote NSC a check to cover the out-of-the-money 
position, with a net-out for December gas invoices only.

I say "only" because I had made it clear to Troy Black, Frank Hayden, John 
Griffith, and anyone else involved that I was not willing to write a check to 
this counterparty without deducting 100% of the amounts owed to Enron by 
National Steel.  While I'm still working on getting details,
