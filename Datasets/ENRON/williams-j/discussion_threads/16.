Clement,

We have received the above master agreements signed by each counterparty.  
Both agreements contemplate a guarantee from Enron Corp.  Accordingly, please 
find attached:

1. Enron Corp. guarantee in favour of Omers Resources Limited

 ; and

2. Enron Corp. guarantee in favour of Superman Resources, Inc.

 

Please print off two originals of each guarantee, have an officer of Enron 
Corp. execute both originals of each guarantee, and then FEDEX both originals 
of each guarantee to me.  Thank you for your assistance.


Sharon
