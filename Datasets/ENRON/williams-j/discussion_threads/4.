Read the text first before the pictures.

This is an advertisement out of a phone book in the US.  This was in the
yellow pages..... until they realized that if you turned it upside down
and covered her head and the hand holding the glass, all was not as it
seemed.  The telephone company has now taken this ad out because of the
content, but we found it for everyone to see.  Take a look at the first
picture, but with the second picture, put your hand over her face and the
glass and see what you get.
