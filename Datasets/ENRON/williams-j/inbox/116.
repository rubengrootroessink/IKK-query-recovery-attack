Howdy!

My name is Jennifer Bohac '87 and I am the new Director of Travel for The Association of
Former Students.  I am excited to be here and look forward to working with you.

We are currently scheduling the trips for 2002, lining up some wonderful and exciting
packages and destinations. I think you will be very pleased at the great trips we are putting
together -- there will be something for everyone.  We will be featuring two "Young Aggie" trips,
an outdoor/adventure outing, as well as packages in a variety of price ranges.  From Australia
to Russia to an African Safari, we will have a super line up!

Many of our remaining 2001 trips are full (which is wonderful) but we do have some openings if
you are searching for a summer or fall getaway.  The following trips have availability:

        Aegean Odyssey (June 19 - 29)
        Voyage of the Goddess (July 13 - 26)
        Norwegian Fjord (July 21 - August 3)
        NATO Trip (August 4 - 14)
        Wales (September 19 - 27)
        Rhine (October 18 - 27) * the first trip is full -- this is a new addition *

If you would like information or to sign up for any of these, give me a call right away!

We are expanding our website to include more information on the Traveling Aggies!  Check
out www.AggieNetwork.com (link to the Traveling Aggies) for trip information, photos from
recent trips, and brochure requests.  As soon as the 2002 schedule is confirmed you will find
detailed information on those trips.

Again, I am thrilled to be a part of The Association and the Traveling Aggies.  Watch for more
information via email and the web.

Feel free to contact me anytime with questions or if I can assist in any way!  Call me at
800-633-7514 or 979-845-7514 or email at bohac@afs.tamu.edu.  I look forward to working
with you!

Gig 'em!
Jennifer Bohac '87, Ph.D.
