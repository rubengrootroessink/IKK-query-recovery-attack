---------------------------------------------------------

MOORE CAPITAL: GROWING IN NEW DIRECTIONS

After the retirement of hedge fund gurus George Soros and Julian Robertson
and the more recent announcement of the split of Bowman Capital Management
and Pequot Capital Management, Moore has quickly moved to the head of this
alternative investment class, although not without its own problems.

Recently the firm has been marred by a series of high profile departures
that began last year with the departure of equity strategist Stanley
Shopkorn.  In the past few months, however, the number of departures has
increased significantly as some of the firm's employees have taken financial
backing from their former employer and splintered off to form their own
hedge funds.

In a situation quite similar to that of Pequot's Arthur Samberg and Dan
Benton, (who is taking some of Pequot's assets to launch Andor Capital
Management), Moore Capital has experienced its own split.  In March 2001,
Moore Capital's technology and telecom group, led by TONY ANAGNOSTAKIS, left
the firm to start the Agnos Group.  With seed money provided by Moore
Capital, Agnos Group maintains a close relationship with Moore.  The firm's
team is composed of Managing Director PETER SWARTZ, Senior Analysts RYAN
SPAYDE and ALEX KOTLYAR, and DANIEL MACCARRONE and ROBERT YUEN.  Around the
same time, JOANNE SOJA, a health care fund manager with Moore Capital, left
the firm to launch Maximus Capital with the help of MSDW's Teresa McRoberts
and Galleon's Prem Lachman.  The Financial Times reported that Maximus, a
health care hedge fund, is backed by Moore Capital.

With the formation of the Agnos Group and Maximus Capital, it appears as if
Moore has expanded into a fund of funds approach, while maintaining its own
hedge funds and private equity ventures.  In addition to expanding other
areas of its business, the firm is also expanding into new locations.  Moore
Capital Management recently hired Thomas Weisel Asset Management's former
chief investment officer Mark Waterhouse to lead the firm's new Boston
office. Prior to joining Thomas Weisel in January 2000, Waterhouse was
employed with Wellington Management Company, LLP where he managed the
Hartford Small Company Fund, Inc.  Additionally, the firm hired former
Putnam Investment Management analyst Brian Pinsker to head the firm's
healthcare group in Boston.

For the quarter ended March 31, 2001, Moore Capital Management's 13F filing
reported $473.0 million in equity assets invested in a portfolio of 70
companies.  This was a dramatic decline from the previous quarter in which
the firm reported $1.4 billion in equity assets invested in a portfolio of
164 companies.

While some may consider ever shrinking 13F filings as evidence of a firm in
trouble, in fact, just the opposite may be true.  When reviewing the 13F
filings of many hedge funds, it is important to remember that these filings
are not always an accurate representation of a firm's true equity assets as
a result of the variety of investing techniques available to hedge funds.
For example, when a firm shorts a stock, essentially borrowing shares that
it will attempt to replace at a lower price thus making money off of the
difference, this will often appear on a 13F as a purchase when in fact they
are just replacing the shares.

Moore Capital's portfolio was invested across a wide variety of industries,
including financials (21.0%), basic materials (17.6%), diversified (13.7%),
consumer staples (12.4%), and communication services (9.3%).  Technology,
which was the second most widely held sector at the end of 2000 with 20.1%,
dropped to only 2.4% in the first quarter of 2001, likely a result of the
formation of the Agnos Group.  The majority of the selling in Moore's
portfolio was felt in the firm's financials, consumer cyclicals, technology
and health care holdings.

New positions for the quarter included Voicestream Wireless Corp. [VSTR]
with 449,909 shares valued at $41.6 million; Burlington Resources Inc. [BR]
with 550,000 shares valued at $24.6 million; Ambac Financial Group Inc.
[ABK] with 200,600 shares valued at $12.7 million; Calpine Corp. [CPN] with
197,900 shares valued at $10.9 million; and, Exelon Corp. [EXC] with 150,000
shares valued at $9.8 million.

Top holdings for the first quarter of 2001 included: Honeywell International
Inc. [HON] with 1,586,400 shares valued at $64.7 million; Quaker Oats Co.
[OAT] with 505,800 shares valued at $49.1 million; Apex Silver Mines [SIL]
with 5,734,266 shares valued at $45.6 million; Voicestream Wireless Corp.

Resources Inc. [BR] with 550,000 shares valued at $24.6 million.

MAVERICK INCREASES EQUITY ASSETS AGAIN

For the first quarter ended March 31, 2001, Dallas-based hedge fund Maverick
Capital Ltd. reported ownership of 94 companies valued at $7.2 billion, an
increase from the previous quarter when the firm reported ownership of 109
companies valued at $6.5 billion.  The firm has distinguished itself from
many other high-flying hedge funds by continuing to consecutively increase
its equity assets under management quarter to quarter.

Top macro-sector weightings this quarter included consumer cyclicals
(20.6%), consumer staples (14.0%) and health care (13.2%).  Maverick was
more bearish on financials and health care, as those sectors declined as a
percentage of the firm's portfolio despite an increasing asset base.

Technology came in at 12.4% of the portfolio.  One year ago, technology
comprised approximately 18.7%.  Maverick, unlike many of its peers, was able
to stick to its GARP-based investment approach.  Indeed, for more than the
past year, the firm's portfolio P/E has remained below that of the S&P 500.


LEE AINSLIE's Maverick Capital considers itself an "opportunistic" investor,
picking up quality companies when prices are considered favorable.   The
firm identifies potential candidates for the portfolio using bottom-up
fundamental analysis.  Maverick looks closely at financial statements for a
financial turnaround and diversifies its portfolio across differing
industrial categories and regions.

Top five holdings included: Nextel Communications Inc. [NXTL] with 3,976,100
shares (valued at $290.3 million); Quaker Oats Co. [OAT] with 2,775,000
shares (valued at $269.3 million); Home Depot Inc. [HD] with 6,000,000
shares (valued at $258.6 million); Philip Morris Cos Inc. [MO] with
5,420,000 shares (valued at $257.2 million); and, AMR Corp. [AMR] with
6,387,200 shares (valued at $224.3 million).

Top five new purchases included: Viacom Inc. - Class B [VIA B] with
4,327,100 shares (valued at $190.3 million); Best Buy Co. Inc. [BBY] with
3,513,900 shares (valued at $126.4 million); Tiffany & Co. [TIF] with
4,575,500 shares (valued at $124.7 million); Gap Inc. [GPS] with 4,536,600
shares (valued at $107.6 million); and, Aon Corp. [AOC] with 3,022,000
shares (valued at $107.3 million).

--------------------------------------------------------

OMEGA LOSES KEY MEMBERS

For the first quarter ended March 31, 2001, hedge fund Omega Advisors
reported ownership of 88 companies valued at $1.8 billion, a decline from
the previous quarter when the firm reported ownership of 86 companies valued
at $2.1 billion.

LEON COOPERMAN's New York-based hedge fund has recently suffered from the
loss of several staff members.  LAWRENCE ROBBINS, formerly a partner at the
firm, and KEN CORNICK, formerly a security analyst, recently left to found
hedge fund Glenview Capital Management.  CHARLES LEEDS, also a former
partner at Omega, also left to found New York-based Hermit Capital
Management.

Top sector weightings for the quarter included: consumer cyclicals (23.8%),
financials (15.8%), utilities (11.0%), consumer staples (10.0%), and basic
materials (9.6%).  Nonetheless, the firm saw a decrease in its holdings in
the capital goods, consumer cyclicals, and diversified sectors.  The core
value player also had a high turnover, averaging 115.0% for the year.

Top five holdings for the quarter included: Galileo International Inc. [GLC]
with 6,104,994 shares (valued at $133.7 million); Ryder System Inc. [R] with

[TYC] with 1,640,521 shares (valued at 70.9 million); IMS Health Inc. [RX]
with 2,657,700 shares (valued at $66.2 million).

Top five new purchases included: Edison International [EIX] with 3,070,700
shares (valued at $38.8 million); Canadian Pacific Ltd. [CP] with 1,049,100
shares (valued at $39.5 million); Freddie Mac [FRE] with 526,000 shares

at $29.6 million); and, KPMG Consulting Inc. [KCIN] with 1,510,000 shares
(valued at $19.6 million).

ACTIVE FUNDS MOVE INTO ENERGY, TECHNOLOGY

While many hedge funds protect their principals by shorting stocks and
utilizing a variety of derivatives, some hedge funds attempt to bolster
their returns using active trading strategies.  Whether the investment
approach is merger arbitrage or classic long/short, the aggressive movement
of assets may enable a hedge fund to garner solid returns in a historically
volatile market.  Nonetheless, the firms' portfolios often represent more
recent market darlings than long-term investments.

March Partners, L.L.C.

For the first quarter ended March 31, 2001, New York-based hedge fund March
Partners, L.L.C. reported ownership of 53 companies valued at $213.0
million, an increase from the previous quarter when the firm reported
ownership of 30 companies valued at $137.1 million.

Top sector weightings included consumer staples (19.2%), technology (16.3%),
utilities (15.7%), communication services (11.0%), and energy (10.9%).
March Partners moved into technology, consumer staples, and energy while
backing away slightly from health care, utilities, and basic materials.
While the firm increased its ownership of energy producers, recent market
darlings, the firm moved away from utilities which have fallen out of favor
in many cases as a result of California's energy woes.

The firm concentrates on event driven investing, including equity
restructurings, risk arbitrage and bankruptcies.  With respect to equity
restructurings, the firm looks for companies that are changing its assets,
capital structure and/or business in some fundamental way.  The firm's event
driven portfolio seeks securities whose values are meaningfully affected by
the occurrence of well-defined future events.  Bottom-up, fundamental
analysis focuses on each company's earnings, cash flow, relative valuations,
financial strength, proprietary products and industry niche.

Top five holdings for the quarter included: Honeywell International Inc.
[HON] with 398,300 shares (valued at $16.3 million); El Paso Corp. [EPG]
with 199,014 shares (valued at $13.0 million); Voicestream Wireless Corp.
[VSTR] with 124,199 shares (valued at $11.5 million); Alza Corp. [AZA] with
265,000 shares (valued at $10.7 million); and, Citadel Communications Corp.
[CITC] with 407,500 shares (valued at $10.1 million).

Top five new purchases included the firm's purchases in El Paso Corp., Alza
Corp., and Citadel Communications.  Rounding out the top five were Tosco
Corp. [TOS] with 225,500 shares (valued at $9.6 million), and AES Corp.
[AES] with 185,151 shares (valued at $9.3 million).  During the quarter,
many new companies found their way into the firm's portfolio.  Not
surprisingly, the firm had an average annual turnover rate of 281.2%.

Taconic Capital Advisors LLC

For the first quarter ended March 31, 2001, New York-based hedge fund
Taconic Capital Advisors LLC reported ownership of 117 companies valued at
$505.7 million, an increase from the previous quarter when the firm reported
ownership of 98 companies valued at $445.1 million.

The firm concentrates primarily on merger arbitrage across all market-caps.
Taconic moved into financials, energy, and technology while backing away
from health care and diversified.  Four of the firm's top five holdings were
new purchases.  The firm has a history of rapid portfolio turnover.  For
this most recent quarter, the firm had an annual portfolio turnover of
206.0%, similar to March Partners.

Top sector holdings included financials (22.0%), technology (18.2%), energy
(13.7%), consumer staples (10.3%), and utilities (8.8%).

Top five holdings for the first quarter ended March 31, 2001 included: Encal
Energy Ltd. [ECA] with 2,061,864 shares (valued at $15.4 million); Glaxo
SmithKline Plc - ADR with 291,445 shares (valued at $15.2 million); Xcel
Energy Inc. [XEL] with 497,027 shares (valued at $15.0 million); Washington
Mutual Inc. [WM] with 342,487 shares (valued at $12.5 million); and, Ralston
Purina Co. [RAL] with 391,520 shares (valued at $12.2 million).

-----------------------------------------------------------

K CAPITAL SELLS OUT OF DIVERSIFIED SECTOR

Boston-based hedge fund K Capital Partners, founded in 1999 by Abner Kurtin
and Thomas Knott, both formerly with Cambridge, MA-based Baupost Group,
L.L.C., manages several investment partnerships including K Capital II,
L.P., K Capital I, L.P., and K Capital Offshore Master Fund, L.P.

K Capital Partners is a value-driven firm that also involves itself with
merger arbitrage.  For value situations, the firm looks to identify a
potential catalyst for a re-rating within their investment time horizon.
Catalysts that the firm will look for include stock buy-backs, spin-offs,
restructurings or new management.

For the quarter ended March 31, 2001, the firm reported $285.6 million in
equity assets invested in a portfolio of 26 companies.  This was an increase
from the previous quarter in which the firm reported $145.0 million in
equity assets invested in a portfolio of 15 companies.

In the fourth quarter of 2000, K Capital's portfolio was tilted in favor of
large-cap companies, which composed 65.7% of the portfolio, with mid- and
small-cap companies comprising the remainder with 8.2% and 26.1%
respectively.  In the first quarter of 2001, the portfolio was distributed
more evenly over all markets capitalizations.  Mid-cap companies garnered
the lion's share of the portfolio with 45.1%, while large- and small-caps
comprised 33.5% and 21.4% respectively.

The most heavily weighted sectors included financials (27.0%), technology
(17.8%), basic materials (10.7%), utilities (8.2%), and energy (6.7%).  From
the fourth quarter of 2000 through the first quarter of 2001, the firm sold
out of its holdings in the diversified sector, which comprised 23.0% of the
portfolio according to the 13F filed for the quarter ended December 31,
2000.

Top holdings for the quarter ended March 31, 2001 included:  KPMG Consulting
Inc. [KCIN] with 2,961,400 shares valued at $38.5 million; Allmerica
Financial Corp. [AFC] with 644,700 shares valued at $33.5 million; State
Street Corp. [STT] with 515,800 shares valued at $24.1 million; Niagara
