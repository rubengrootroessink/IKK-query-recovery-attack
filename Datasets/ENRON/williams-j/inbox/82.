Greetings from NetBank. This message is to provide
you with important information about the transition
of your former CompuBank account to NetBank on
Saturday, May 12.

Online Bill Pay - The last day to schedule online
bill payments is Thursday, May 10. Your recurring
payments and your payee information will be
transferred to NetBank.  Your payment history will
not be transferred to your NetBank account; if you
want this for your records, please print it before
Thursday.

View Only - You will be able to view your accounts
online at CompuBank on Friday, May 11, and until
transition on Saturday, May 12. Transfers by phone
and online will not be possible, and balances will
not be updated during this transition period.
Please begin to login to your account directly at
http://www.netbank.com on Saturday, May 12, and
thereafter.

Please take a moment to go to
http://www.netbank.com/compubank/timeline.htm
for more important information about your new
account and its transition to NetBank. The page
will be updated throughout the weekend. If your
questions are not answered there, please call
NetBank Customer Service 24x7 at 1-888-BKONWEB
(1-888-256-6932), send a message from the Contact
Us page on our Web site, or after the transition

We hope May 12 will mark the beginning of a long
banking relationship with NetBank.
