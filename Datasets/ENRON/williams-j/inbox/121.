Laura has told me that she would like for me to get together with you in order for you to show me around the joint Enron & People's Energy website used in the Chicago office.  I would be happy to do this anytime in the next few days at your convenience.  The advantage of being a brand new intern is that I don't have many scheduling difficulties.
