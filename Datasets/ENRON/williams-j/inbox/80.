For those of you that do not know, we are planning
greg's bachelor party for the weekend of May 19th.

We've rented a beach house in Surfside.  The beach
house is front row on the portion of the beach that
allows open fires and automobiles on the beach...both
very cool things.

We have the house Friday night, Saturday, and Sunday.
Jeff, Greg, and I will probably arrive Friday night,
however the main shindig will get kicked off on
Saturday night.  I don't exactly know what the main
shindig is, but we realize that most people won't be
able to pull themselves away from their miserable
lives for an entire weekend.  Jeff, Greg, and I
however, will make sure that the keg is working
properly friday evening.

So what I need from you is a confirmation that you
will:
A - Be there Friday and Saturday
B - Be there Sometime Saturday, Leave sometime
Saturday
C - Be there Saturday, Leave Sunday
D - Can't make it.  Dallas is too far from Surfside.

Cost will be $625 for the house for the entire
weekend.  So depending on how many people we get the
price should be between $60-$100 per person.  Each
person will be responsible for their own food, and a
sleeping bag/pillow, etc.  No linens are provided,
(I'm assuming this means no towels either) but I think
they have a grill so that's the important thing.  Greg
will confirm.

Cards, Dominoes', booze, beach shit, etc.  are other
good items to bring.

We will send specific directions at a later time.

Let me know your status so we can get a better handle
on costs.  I will pass on more info (costs/directions)
as we get it.

Later.

jk
