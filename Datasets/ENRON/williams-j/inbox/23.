Jason,
	The 138 MMBtu was cut @ Will County per conversation with our Gas
Transportation Services area.  Jeanette Trinidad of the area said ANR told
her when they tried to confirm the gas with Border @ Will County the lesser
number was confirmed.

Also, the 3,661 MMBtu cut for the 19th on Border contract R0259F will be
taken away from Peoples Gas.  Peoples will reduce its SIQ amount of 125,000
to 121,201 (3,661 + 138).
