Hey, Dave, 

Users of the People's Energy web site on the Chicago side have raised an issue that 
it takes several times to click the "submit" button on the Nomination page (http://peoplesenergy.enron.com/nominationsNew.asp) 
to actually insert the data to the database, and then these data become viewable on the other page. 
Please look into this when you get back. The contact on Chicago side is Jerry at 312 762 1654. (he will be out next week, and come
back on the 18th.) Jason should be able to answer related questions too. 

Thanks.

Yan
