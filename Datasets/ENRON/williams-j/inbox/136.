Besides the 3 MMBtu cut there was a 7 MMBtu cut for the 21st.  The reason
Jeanette is not reporting it is because North Shore took that supply to
storage.  Jeanette does not see that nomination. She only confirms cuts @
the citygate.

North Shore reduced its SIQ purchase of 10,000 for the 21st by 10 MMBtu.
The revised SIQ amount is 9,990.
