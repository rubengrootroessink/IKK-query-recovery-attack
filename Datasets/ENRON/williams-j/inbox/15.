Hey all... We have set up id's on several new gates and pipelines for Enova=
te starting April 1, so now we are able to nominate directly from Enovate w=
ithout going thru Enron North America.    I am trying to be consistent on h=
ow we nominate the gas so that when accounting looks at Unify/Sitara and th=
e pipeline/ldc statements everything ties out nicely.  =20

We had a couple of situations this morning where Peoples (Bob Hayes) and Pe=
oples Energy Services (Jeanette Mendoza) were getting conflicting informati=
on as to which Enron entity they should be nominating from. =20

For example,   at the beginning of the month we call every counterparty and=
 confirm volumes.  We called Peoples Energy Services and said that Enovate =
was selling 5,000 to them on deal #695025.  We nominated the gas to Peoples=
 Energy Services for 4/1/01-4/30/01 from Enovate.    When the on call rep a=
t PGLC for the weekend looked at our noms vs. Peoples Energy Services noms,=
  there was a mismatch due to the upstream counterparty Peoples Energy Serv=
ices was using.  Therefore Irene had to change Peoples Energy Services nomi=
nation.  This was not a huge deal, but it is time consuming and confusing f=
or the ldc reps at PGLC.    Jeanette at Peoples Energy Services called me t=
his morning to say that she had talked to  Paul and that he had told  her t=
hat she should be nominating from Enron North America NOT Enovate and that =
was how they had nominated the gas.    I explained that we had several Enro=
n entities and that Enovate was actually selling the gas to her and that wa=
s how we nominated the gas to her on PGLC (this is also how the deals are i=
n both Sitara and Unify).  I also told her that we would make sure and call=
 if that changed and Enron North America sold her gas as well as Enovate.

I was thinking that whenever there is a question on how to nominate your de=
als  if you would refer your counterparty to either myself or Margie.  Then=
 if we have a question we can go to you.   That way we are in the loop as w=
ell and can be proactive in making sure that everyone is nominating from th=
e correct Enron entity and also avoid confusion for everyone in the chain f=
rom the supply to the market to the pipe/ldc. =20


Thanks again!!! =20
