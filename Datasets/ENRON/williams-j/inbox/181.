Jason, I checked the Gas Fundamentals web site the sendouts seems to be working OK, I am not sure what issue
Jerry has. I called him earlier this morning. could not get hold of him. But I did leave a message on his phone for him
to call me back. I'll see what I can do to help him. Of course I'll keep you updated.
