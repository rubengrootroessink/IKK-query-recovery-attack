Hey bud, it is great to hear from you.  Congrats on the promotion... you
will do an awesome job!!!  I hope you get a chance to go to italy, it is
really beautiful and you will enjoy it immensely.  It took about 3 weeks to
go through the Panama Canal and get to Hawaii and we pulled into port for
about 4 1/2 days.  We had a great time, but I'm really looking forward to
Hawaii on the way back because we are going to be there for a week and
Cassandra is going to join me.  We are heading further west and will
participate in some maneuvers in a couple of days.  I can't tell you where
because our satellite might be monitered but Cassey knows.  I got an e-mail
from John Ohlenburg the other day... that was pretty random.  He is coming
back to Houston so maybe you will run into him.  Thanks for writing and I'm
glad to hear that everything is going well.  Say hello to Joanna for me and
I can't wait to come home and hang out with y'all!  I talked with Ferg about
getting a hunting trip together.  I miss you Bud.  Adios!!!!

Hey Buddy,
     Sorry it took me so long to write back, but it is tough to do at work
and I kept putting it off.  Sorry about that, I will get better at writing
back. So what is up man?  How has the sea been treating you? So what have
you been doing, and what have you seen?  Around here the same ole stuff is
goin on. Work, Golf and hanging out.  Thats about it.  Ferg got his new
Yelliw Lab at the end of April. He named him Walter.  He's a pretty good
lookin dog, but he has been cutting in to their sleep time.  Chris and
Sarah had to start wearing ear plugs at night because the dog kept whining.
I thought that was pretty hilarious. Well, I finally got promoted.  I am
now a full time trader. Its pretty cool, but ot can be real stressful. I'm
still pretty much doing what I was before, but now I have to take full
responsibility in all profits and losses.  So far its been goin Okay, but
the days when you have on the wrong positions it can really suck.  Joanna's
brother graduated last week from Galveston A&M.  He already got a job and
started Wednesday for a shipping broker.  He is staying with us until July
1 then he is going to Paris to train for 3 months.  That should be pretty
cool!  Jo is still traveling alot. She went to Toronto, Miami, London, and
she is going to Berlin in June.  Wer might be going to Italy in September
for our anniversary.  She is going for work and I might try to tag along.
The weather has  been pretty good around here lately, all the Golf course
are in great shape.  I shot a 77 the other day at FT. Bend - 41-36.  Pretty
inconsistent, but I'll take it.  I bogied 18 to miss shotting 1 under.
How's Cass doing. I keep meaning to call her, but I haven't yet.  We miss
seeing you guys and look forward to kicking back and drinking some beer and
listening to all your stories.  I hope all is well and lookin forward to
seeing you soon.  Keep our country safe, we're counting on you.  "You and
your faggoty white uniforms."  Just kiddin -

                              Peace
