Kriendler and Willy - 

Would you guys be willing to have your installations done for the Remote Energy Management Pilot done next week.  You would be 2 out of the 10 first test homes.  I would be coming by with the installers and possibly some media people.  You can get the royal treatment.

If so, I need to get some information:

1)  What is your address.

2)  What is your home phone number?

3)  What is your office phone?

4)  Do you have dial-up internet connection or broadband?

5)  If you have broadband, is it cable or DSL?

6)  If you have broadband, who is your provider?



Regards,
Kevin
