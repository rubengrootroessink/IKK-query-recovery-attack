Jason,
	138 MMBtu was cut after the final GISB cycle on ANR Contract 104684.
The cut was the result of Northern Border confirming the incorrect number
during the timely, evening and intraday 1 cycles.

The supply @ Will County for Peoples went from 40,000 to 39,862.  Peoples
Gas reduced its SIQ purchase from Enron North America.  The purchase went
from 125,000 to 124,862.
