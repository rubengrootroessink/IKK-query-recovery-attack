Dudes-

Just wanted to get a few details out to you about the weekend of debauchery
coming up.

The address of the house is 2730 Swan Court, Surfside Beach, TX 77541

Directions:

*	Drive South on TX-288 (approx 40 miles).
*	Merge onto 332 East (you don't exit the road basically becomes
332E/288).
*	Drive through Lake Jackson about 7ish miles.
*	Take the Angelton/Surfside Exit (it is an overpass, you need to be
on it!).
*	You will drive approx. and 10 miles on 332E.
*	Turn left on Bluewater Highway (at the bottom of a bridge, if you
miss the turn you will end up in the ocean).
*	Turn Right onto Swan Ct. (approx. 3-5 miles down the road)

My cell phone is 281-787-2144, I will keep it on when I get there.

Some of us are going on Friday, I also have commitments for Sat. arrivals.
But Sat. will be the official deal, feel free to head down whenever you
would like.

Things you will need to bring:

*	Fully functional liver
*	donation towards the fee for the house (total of $625) would be
extremely appreciated, everyone could throw in some cash (checks also
accepted with 2 forms of ID)
*	Sheets/sleeping bag & pillow
*	whatever you want to eat, there is a smoker, feel free to bring
steak/chicken/fajitas
*	lawn chairs, fold up chairs
*	bug spray
*	drinking water
*	(Jason/Jeff/me) are loading up on beer, but if everybody at least
brings a 12 pack it will ensure plenty to go around
*	SPF 7000 for Sheedy
*	a giant umbrella to provide shade for MccUtcheons huge hands
*	if hatcher were coming we would need one xtra floaty for his nut
(Aaron, Graeme, these will be explained later)

I am going to bring a ton of wood to burn, horse shoes, dominoes.  But bring
whatever beach-worthy things you can think of (i.e.. footballs, frisbee's,
sailboats (Dan!!!))

I am taking Fri. off, so I am heading down midday'ish.  head down there when
you can.

ps- if you are bringing a dog, make sure to bring a crate or tie of some
sort, I would like to keep dog's in the house to a minimum, they will have a
deposit (easy Kriendler, if you have to sleep with your dog, I won't argue,
but I would like to keep the inside dog traffic to somewhat of need only
basis).  They will be keeping $$$ deposit and if the place is completely
trashed they will probably charge me.

that's all I can think for now, please forward to anyone I may have omitted.

Jeff/Jason - please forward to Dan (I don't have his new email)

see you at the beach!!
