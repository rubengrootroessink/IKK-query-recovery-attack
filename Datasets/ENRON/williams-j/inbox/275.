k Brunell , QB JAC - JWillie Updated 11/27/01 Brunell is questionable for M=
onday's game against Green Bay, the third straight week his status has been=
 in question due to continued pain in his quadriceps muscle. He will be lim=
ited again in practice, and it's probably a good idea to keep him on reserv=
e for Week 12 in your league.  Terrell Davis , RB DEN - JWillie Updated 11/=
27/01 Davis should be able to return from arthroscopic knee surgery in time=
 for Sunday's game against ! Mi! ami. He will practice this week before a f=
inal decision is made, but we're skeptical the Broncos won't have him split=
 carries with Mike Anderson, limiting both players' Fantasy values.  Keith =
Poole , WR DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Poole has bruised ribs that wi=
ll likely keep him on the sidelines for Sunday's game against Miami. If he =
can't play, Kevin Kaspar would start in his place, and the Denver passing g=
ame would further suffer.  Rod Smith , WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/27/01 Smit=
h now has two sprained ankles, and is questionable for Sunday's game agains=
t Miami. If he can't play, then the Broncos might have to start Kevin Kaspa=
r and Chris Cole at wideout, depending on Keith Poole's recovery from a rib=
 injury.  James Jackson , RB CLE - Hunter Updated 11/27/01 Jackson's ankle =
remains sore, and he will be re-evaluated Wednesday to determine his status=
 for Sunday's game against Tennessee. Benjamin Gay and Jamel White would co=
ntinue to split carries if Jackson can't go.  Neil Rackers , K CIN - Free A=
gent Updated 11/27/01 Bengals Head Coach Dick LeBeau said Monday he has not=
 yet made a decision on the status of Rackers, who missed two field-goal ch=
ances Sunday. He is 9-for-18 in field goals this season, and Jaret Holmes h=
as been on the practice squad since Nov. 1. Rackers will likely retain the =
job for Sunday's game against Tampa Bay, but he's a very risky Fantasy star=
ter based on his struggles.  Akili Smith , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/2=
7/01 Bengals Head Coach Dick LeBeau said Monday that Smith might be promote=
d to No. 2 quarterback, according to The Cincinnati Enquirer . "If that's w=
hat they're going to do, maybe the Bengals need to get rid of me," Smith sa=
id, citing a desire to be traded if he's used in a mop-up role. He's not a =
recommended Fantasy choice, although it's important to note that he's now l=
ikely next in line if Jon Kitna gets hurt.  Terry Allen , RB BAL - Tori Upd=
ated 11/27/01 Allen, who remains out with a broken hand, could return to th=
e lineup on Dec. 16. With the Ravens losing Jason Brookins to an injury, do=
n't be surprised if Allen takes back the starting job once healthy. Hold on=
to him if you have the room on your reserve list or play in a deeper league=
.  Moe! ! Williams , RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Williams becomes =
the Ravens' featured back after the injury to Jason Brookins. If you play i=
n a deeper league or are desperate for a running back, consider picking up =
Williams, although you shouldn't expect him to post great stats unless the =
matchup is very favorable.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Tori Updated 11/27/01=
 Results of X-rays on Brookins' foot revealed a fracture of a bone in his s=
mall toe, which will sideline him for at least four weeks and possibly the =
rest of the season. Moe Williams becomes the Ravens' starting running back,=
 and might be worth adding to your roster in a deeper league.  Wayne Chrebe=
t , WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 11/27/01 Chrebret did not practice Monday beca=
use of a shoulder injury. However, The New York Newsday reports that he is =
expected to play in Sunday's game.   Jake Arians , K BUF - Free Agent Updat=
ed 11/27/01 Arians has been released by the Bills. Buffalo has signed Shayn=
e Graham to replace him.   Edgerrin James , RB IND - JWillie Updated 11/27/=
0!  Colts coach Jim Mora said James' surgery to repair a torn ligament in h=
is left knee was successful Saturday in Miami.  Mora said he received the n=
ews from orthopedic surgeon Dr. Arthur Rettig, a team physician. "I spoke w=
ith him Saturday and he told me it went very well," Mora said. James, the t=
wo-time NFL rushing champion, injured the knee when he was tackled awkwardl=
y late in a game at Kansas City on Oct. 25. He was placed on injured reserv=
e last week. James' rehabilitation is expected to take seven months. He is =
not expected to take part in either of the Colts offseason minicamps. Team =
president Bill Polian has not said whether James will be ready for the star=
t of training camp.     Terry Glenn , WR NE - Matty Updated 11/27/01 Glenn =
could be put on injured reserve if he doesn't recover from a hamstring inju=
ry soon. That would mean the end of his season, and perhaps the end of his =
Patriots career. "I haven't reached it yet," coach Bill Belichick said Mond=
ay when asked when he would decide if the roster spot would be better spent=
 on someone other than Glenn. "But as each day goes by, it gets a little bi=
t closer."      Shayne Graham , K SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 The Buf=
falo Bills signed Graham as their kicker Tuesday, a day after Jake Arians w=
as released following a missed point-after against the Miami Dolphins. Grah=
am had been released by the Seattle Seahawks before the start of the season=
.   Stephen Alexander , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Alexander, who=
 has been hampered by a ankle injury, returned to action on Sunday. He didn=
't start, however, and may lose playing time to both Walter Rasby and Zeron=
 Flemister for the rest of the season. Unless you play in a deeper league, =
dropping Alexander is advisable.  Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Neal/McKay Upda=
ted 11/27/01 Hakim, who is dealing with an ankle injury, played in Monday n=
ight's 24-17 loss to Tampa Bay. He had three catches for 29 yards in the ga=
me.   Kevan Barlow , RB SF - Tori Updated 11/27/01 Barlow suffered a disloc=
ated shoulder during Sunday's win over Indianapolis. "It's throbbing," Barl=
ow told the Contra Costa Times. "I couldn't really sleep last night. I had =
to sleep sitting up. It's hurting." Barlow is listed as doubtful for Sunday=
's game against Buffalo, so be sure to place him on reserve.     Terrell Ow=
ens , WR SF - Martin Updated 11/27/01 Owens suffered a sprained right foot =
on Sunday to go along with his sprained left ankle. X-rays were negative, b=
ut Owens' foot was placed in a protecti! ve! boot as a precaution. He is ex=
pected to miss some practice time this week, but he will be in the starting=
 lineup on Sunday when the Niners face Buffalo.   Jeff Thomason , TE PHI - =
Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Thomason suffered a hyperextended knee during S=
unday's loss to Washington. He missed practice on Monday, and is status for=
 Week 12 is uncertain at this time. The reserve tight end has very little v=
alue as a Fantasy player.   Donald Driver , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/2=
7/01 Driver, who has been inactive for three straight weeks due to a thigh =
injury, returned to practice on Monday. His status for Week 12 remains uncl=
ear, but he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team in any event.   Tyron=
e Davis , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Davis, who has been out all y=
ear due to a hamstring injury, will likely find out what his status with th=
e Packers will be this week. Depending on his health, the team will either =
activate him, place him on injured reserve or cut him altogehter.   James S=
tewart , RB DET - Hunter Updated 11/27/01 ! Stewart, who suffered a neck st=
inger in last Thursday's game against Green Bay, is expected to be availabl=
e for Week 12. He'll have a tough time posting good Fantasy numbers against=
 Chicago's tough run defense, but the lack of depth at running back in the =
league makes it tough to bench him.   Charlie Batch , QB DET - Free Agent U=
pdated 11/27/01 According to the Detroit Free Press , Batch is expected to =
start Sunday's game against Chicago despite a groin injury. "This is Charli=
e's offense," coach Marty Mornhinweg said. "He practiced a little bit today=
...he was in all weekend getting (the injury) treated...I would expect him =
close to full speed Wednesday." He'll likely lose snaps to rookie QB Mike M=
cMahon, however, so starting Batch is a risky proposition.   Jackie Harris =
, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Harris missed last week's game again=
st Denver due to a hamstring injury. The veteran tight end is listed as day=
 to day.   Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - Martin Update! d ! 11/27/01 According =
to coach Dick Jaroun, Thomas' status for Week 12 is still uncertain. In fac=
t, the Bears don't expect to know if Thomas, who is dealing with a hamstrin=
g injury, will be available until later in the week.   Brad Hoover , RB CAR=
 - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Hoover (neck) will likely be held out of pra=
ctice this week. However, the Panthers are hopeful that he'll be available =
for Sunday's game against New Orleans.   Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Tori Updat=
ed 11/27/01 Despite his inconsistent play and 14 interceptions, Weinke's jo=
b as Carolina's No. 1 quarterback is secure. "There've been quarterbacks wh=
o have gone on to be very successful that have gone through times like this=
," coach George Seifert told the Charlotte Observer. "Even though there are=
 a number of these plays that haven't turned out and there have been disrup=
tions in his play, I think, ultimately, it will be more beneficial than not=
." While he may be the starting quarterback in Carolina, Weinke isn't worth=
 a roster spot in most Fantasy leagues.   Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Age=
nt Updated 11/27/01 Sanders, who left Sunday's game against San Diego due t=
o nagging hamstring injuries, is questionable for the Cards' Week 12 matchu=
p at Oakland. However, ! he! is optimistic that he'll be available for the =
game. "I'll be there," Sanders told the Arizona Republic. "They're just rea=
l sore from doing a lot of running and jumping - normal wear and tear." In =
any event, keeping Sanders on your bench may be a good idea against the tou=
gh Oakland secondary.   Rob Moore , WR ARI - Martin Updated 11/27/01 Moore =
(hamstring) was supposed to begin some light running last week, but he ende=
d up doing nothing of the sort. "He hasn't made a lot of progress," coach D=
ave McGinnis told the Arizona Republic. "We're going to come to a point whe=
re we're going to have to make a decision." Moore, who has missed the entir=
e season due to injury, could be placed on the injured reserve list this we=
