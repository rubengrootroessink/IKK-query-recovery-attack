Subject:	Cut on ANR to Peoples Gas Contract 104684

Jason,
	I verbally confirmed the cut that occurred for gas day May 30th with
Irene Isais of our Gas Transportation Services department.  Peoples ANR
contract 104684 was cut by 6,599 MMBtu throughout the May 30th gas day.

The supply was cut because PGL Gas Supply was not told by Enron North
America that the Northern Border supply @ Will County had been reallocated
on different contracts.  All four GISB cycles were exercised in an attempt
to receive the entire 40,000 but since the contract mismatch was not
corrected until the final cycle, Peoples lost 6,599 MMBtu for the day.

Peoples reduced its SIQ purchase from 125,000 to 118,401 for gas day May
30th.
