David,

	Bryan referred me to you.  We are supporting the People's Energy website which interfaces with an Oracle db.  
It has been functioning properly until recently.  I currently do not have insight to see what the connection string is in production,
but when trying to connect to the development database "peoplesdev", using U=peoples_user P=peoples_user, I am receiving the
error "ORACLE not available".

Do you know if this database is out, or if the login parameters have changed?

Thanks,

David Dronet
