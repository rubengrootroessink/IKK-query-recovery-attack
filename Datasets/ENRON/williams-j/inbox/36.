Gals,

Hey guys!  I am feeling a little happier today...we had sunshine yesterday!
And I took full advantage of it.  I took the boys out to the playground in
the backyard at 1100 and didn't come in until 5pm!  I even grilled hotdogs
and hamburgers for lunch for 8 kids and 5 moms!  We had one big picnic.  Our
location with the neighborhood playground in our backyard is perfect--I
couldn't ask for better.  There is even a big sand pit for them to play in.
And now the kids are old enough to run around while I lounge on our patio
watching them from a distance.  I wish ya'll could see it.  I guess Jo will
have a chance in about 3 weeks though!

Nolan did nap on the couch for a few hours but Jason did not.  Jason could
not keep his eyes open once we came inside.  I immediately gave them baths
(at 5pm) and put pj's on.  We have peanut butter and jelly for dinner while
I prodded Jason to stay awake.  It was good though--they both slept in until
7:30am this morning.

Today, it looks like a pretty day as well.  I have already been jogging and
dropped Jason off at pre-school.  Now I have to figure out how to be at
volleyball practice (we are having a battalion wives' volleyball challenge
on Thursday) at 11am-12:30, pick-up Jason from pre-school at 1130am and drop
off my friend for her family pictures at noon.  Seems kind of impossible!
Hopefully I will get my neighbor to get Jason from preschool.  Then I need
to feed the boys and nap them so that they are well rested for their
photo-op at 4pm this afternoon.  I think I might just do jean shorts and
white T-shirts since I can't find any dress clothes for them.  Finally,
tonight, I am suppose to play in my first soccer game with my German Women's
team at 6:30pm.  It exhausts me just thinking of everything.

The kinderfest went well.  I made home-made colored clay for "handprints and
clay creations!"  I had to make 20 batches of clay (120 baseball size balls
of clay).  It took me over 4 hours and my arm was cramping from stirring all
the batches.  Luckily Wayne came home and helped with the last 5 batches.
We used over 100 balls of it at the Kinderfest and I think the kids enjoyed
it!  Unfortunately we didn't sign anyone up for the AFTB classes but did
hand out some info on them.

The boys are doing well.  Jason got some splinters in his foot yesterday and
it was very traumatic this morning trying to get them out.  Nolan is talking
up a storm but prefers using one to two word phrases still.  However, he can
count to 12 on his own--it is amazing!  Jason is Nolan's teacher.  He reads
him books and asks Nolan questions like:  "Nolan, where is the oval?...Good
job Nolan!... Now, where is the square?"  Jason can officially dress himself
(minus the socks--he still doesn't do socks)!  This makes life a bit easier
for me.

On another note, I like Oprah's idea of a marriage sabatical.  Maybe we can
plan one for all of us--oh, I guess that would be a girl's weekend!  Well,
Nolan just walked in and asked me to come downstairs with him to watch
Caillou--how can I refuese that offer!

Love and miss you,
T
