Featured article this week:
Outlooks Slip for CIENA, Vodafone, Level 3
On May 23, analysts at Morgan Stanley
downgraded the shares of this optical-networking
company, which they call "the best-positioned company
in the sector," to Neutral - V from Outperform  - V.
(A "V" implies above-average volatility in the stock:
It has a 25% chance of moving 25% higher or lower in
a month, and is likely to become more volatile in the
next one to 12 months, compared with its performance
during the past three years.) The analysts see limited
upside from current levels for the shares, which closed
at $63.11 on May 24.
