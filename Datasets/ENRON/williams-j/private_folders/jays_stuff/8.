In the spirit of Christmas, God bless you every one, but grades are not
changed after the fact.

I thought of you guys when I saw the announcement of Oldsmobile's
demise. Before you break your arm patting yourself on the back, let me
remind you that the assignment was to think about the basis for
attitudes and how one might changes attitudes, and, by giving up and
shutting down Oldsmobile, you were basically taking a whiff on the
assignment. In fact, the more I think about it, the more I'm tempted to
see if your grades can be reduced.

Anyway, it's good to hear from you. I hope that things are going well
for all of you.
