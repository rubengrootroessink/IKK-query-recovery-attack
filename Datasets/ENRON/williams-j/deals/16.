See below.  No e-dash necessary.....

I have already informed accounting and will do the same for treasury.  I was 
told treasury needs to know by 2:00 pm today if the funds need to be wired 
tomorrow.

I will call soon to discuss.  I am still working on the outstanding 
receivable amount.  According to physical settlements (Darla Saucier) they 
only owe us $1,190,803 for December gas on both deals, $789,973 for the one 
month deal and $400,830 for the 10-year deal.

Jay Williams in Credit is verifying this and we will check in TAG to make 
sure we are not missing a deal.

Eric

Eric,

I spoke to Dave Gorte regarding this National Steel transaction, and he 
indicated that he did not think the EDASH was necessary as there is no risk 
in the transaction as we are only closing an existing position.  It is 
clearly a funding issue, and we need to be certain that Joe and the Treasury 
group are aware of the exact dollars going out on which day.  Please give me 
a call to discuss.

Thanks,
Tanya
