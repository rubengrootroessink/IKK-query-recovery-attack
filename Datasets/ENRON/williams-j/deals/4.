I am not sure we have any rights to take any action.  Given our overall 
investment (debt and equity), I would recommend we hold tight.  Let's follow 
up with Lisa and John on a regular basis to insure we are on top of the issue.

Thanks,
Bill

Subject: Update on Heartland Steel


Bill -

I talked to John Enerson about Heartland Steel, and he tells me that things 
are OK with respect to their payments on delivered gas.  Heartland has paid 
Enron for all of its physical delivered gas, and we now have them on 
pre-payment for future gas delivery.

The MTM exposure is another issue, of course.  Enerson thinks that Heartland 
will have to cease operations within the next 2-3 weeks.  Do we need to take 
any action with respect to the MTM exposure position???
