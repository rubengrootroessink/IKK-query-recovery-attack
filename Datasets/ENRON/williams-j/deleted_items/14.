OCTANE CAPITAL RUNS OUT OF GAS

In a recent letter to shareholders, Octane Capital Management announced that
it will stop making new investments and will return half of its estimated
$265 million in assets to investors.  The remaining capital will stay
invested.  Since mid to late 2000, the fund has reportedly had trouble
finding new suitable investments.  Rather than invest in companies it did
not find viable, the firm's managers have decided to return their excess
assets.

The firm was founded in March 2000 by a formidable team, seeking to
capitalize on the raging bull market.  The timing could not have been worse.
The firm's founding in March 2000 came at the beginning of the Internet
bubble's burst, and the market declines that came with it.  While the firm
was able to garner returns early on, its prospects became increasingly dim
as the floor fell out of the IPO market.

The firm started out looking to get into companies on the ground floor by
operating a "cross-over" style fund.  The fund invested in companies with a
public offering on the horizon.  Ideally, the firm would be able to identify
solid companies and benefit handsomely after an IPO pop.  The firm's
established staff helped lend an air of prestige to the firm itself.  Octane
Capital was originally founded with the help of Emeric McDonald and Alex
Monte-Santo (both formerly with Amerindo Investment Advisors, Inc.), David
Golob (formerly with Tiger Management L.L.C.), Tim Murphy (formerly with
Capital Research & Management), and George Lee and Laura Paradis (former
bankers with Goldman Sachs).

Unfortunately, the firm concentrated on companies with high revenues
regardless of earnings.  (In many cases, the kinds of companies that have
taken a beating in the market recently.)  The firm specifically invests in
emerging growth companies within the technology sector. Using a fundamental
approach, Octane seeks companies with high revenue growth, leadership
qualities and innovative products. Unlike other sectors, emerging growth
within the technology sector may include companies that have reached large
market caps.  The public equity portfolio typically consists of 20 to 40
core issues; some of which are private investments that have since gone
public.

In the year 2000, there was approximately $223 billion in U.S. common stock
underwriting, up from $175 billion in 1999 according to Thomson Financial
Securities Data.  However, much of last year's gain was a result of a high
volume of new issues introduced in the first quarter of 2000.  More
foreboding for firms such as Octane Capital- approximately 68% of IPOs were
trading below their issue price as of the beginning of 2001.

Many analysts believe that Octane Capital is one of the many firms that will
soon be winding down their operations and consolidating with other firms.
Venture capital and crossover funds flourished throughout 1999 and early
2000, offering tremendous returns as a result of a frantic and euphoric
stock market.  As the IPO market has suffered, so have the firms most
closely tied to it.

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO. MERGE TO CREATE INVESTMENT POWERHOUSE

Throughout the past few months, the buzz on the street was the recent merger
between Chase Manhattan Corp. and J.P. Morgan & Co., completed on December
31, 2000.  The merged firm operates under the name J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.
with various deviations for the subsidiaries.

A global competitor with operations in over 60 countries, stockholders
equity valued at more than $39 billion, assets in excess of $705 billion and
a market-cap of roughly $83 billion, the newly merged J.P. Morgan Chase &
Co. is an investment management powerhouse.  The firm activities encompass
investment banking, strategic advisory, equity and debt capital raising,
credit, global trading, market making activities, operating services, wealth
management, institutional asset management and private equity.

UNITED STATES



J.P. Morgan and Chase have complimented each other with various investment
styles ranging from growth to value.  For example, Houston-based J.P. Morgan
Fleming Asset Management- U.S. (formerly Chase Fleming Asset Management and
Chase Texas Investment Management Group), is a core growth investor
utilizing four equity strategies; equity income; America core; equity
growth; and small-cap.  Research is guided by proprietary valuations and
decisions are made based on company visits, discussions with customers and
competitors and industry analysts.  The firm's analysts then make
recommendations to the senior portfolio managers who ultimately make the
final decision.  On the other hand, New York-based J.P. Morgan Investment
Management, Inc., which employs an active equity strategy, is designed to
outperform the S&P 500 based on a bottom-up GARP philosophy.  Internal
fundamental research, systematic stock valuation and disciplined portfolio
construction enable the firm to build solid portfolios.  J.P. Morgan places
greater emphasis on normalized earnings and long-term growth rates and less
emphasis on near-term earnings.  The firm uses a proprietary DDM to derive
at a DDR (dividend discount rate).  The DDR serves a dual purpose, allowing
investment professionals to rank each potential investment and determine
performance for possible sell-outs.  Similar to the Houston office, a
majority of the research is conducted in-house, with decisions made on a
team basis between analysts and portfolio managers.  The combination of
Chase and J.P. Morgan has enabled the firm to offer a wider array of
investment philosophies.

As a result of the merger, structural changes have begun to take place and
will continue throughout the next few months.  The Houston office of Chase
Fleming Asset Management (formerly Chase Texas Investment Management Group)
has exchanged the Chase brand name for J.P. Morgan and now operates as J.P.
Morgan Fleming Asset Management.  The former New York office of Chase
Fleming, previously located on 320 Park Avenue, has merged with the team at
J.P. Morgan Investment Management, located at 522 Fifth Avenue.  Some of the
equity analysts that have relocated are: ROBERT ZECH, who follows small-cap
and private equity; CRAIG LEIGHTON, who follows micro-cap companies; GLENN
GAWRONSKI, who covers small-cap stocks; CLARE HART, who covers media
staples, transportation and media cyclicals; RICHARD ROYCE, who covers high
tech - hardware and software and cellular/wireless telecom; DAVID EDWARDS,
who covers small-cap and private equity, along with GARY SCHNIEROW, who
follows small-cap and micro-cap stocks.  The portfolio managers are as
follows:  T. GARY LIBERMAN, who follows high tech - hardware and software;
CHRISTOPHER JONES, who follows health care and consumer cyclicals; ANTHONY
GIFFORD, who covers consumer staples and communication services; TIMOTHY
PARTON, who covers transportation, business staples, business cyclicals,
non-bank financials, financials (diversified) and services (employment,
payroll process, facilities/environmental); EYTAN SHAPIRO, who covers
machinery, media staples and media cyclicals, MICHEAL FOSS, who covers food
& beverages, and computer services; along with JONATHAN SIMON who covers
real estate, non-bank financials, financial (diversified), insurance
(life/health, property-casualty and multi-line).

As a result of the merger between J.P. Morgan & Chase, the December 31, 2000
filing is a combination of approximately 32 institutions. J.P. Morgan
Investment Management, Morgan Guaranty, Chase Fleming, and Chase Asset
Management (now J.P. Morgan Private Bank) are among the entities now
included in this filing.

UNITED KINGDOM

Numerous changes have occurred at the London offices J.P. Morgan Fleming
Asset Management U.K. Ltd. as well.  The firm also dropped the use of the
Chase brand name, as both the J.P. Morgan and Fleming brand names carried
the most cache in much of the U.K.  Following the merger of Chase and
Fleming, Chase Fleming moved to a new office at 10 Aldermanbury from its old
Copthall Avenue location in September 2000.  While the merger between J.P.
Morgan and Chase was completed at the beginning of the year, the firms did
not combine physically until late April 2001.  Following the merger with
J.P. Morgan, the former Chase Fleming made yet another move to Finsbury
Dials, its current location.  The combined firm, J.P. Morgan Fleming Asset
Mgmt. U.K. Ltd., started operating out of its new offices on April 30, 2001.
The former J.P. Morgan entity also changed its location, moving from King
St. to join its sister staff at Finsbury Dials.  However, the combined
location has not led to a combined investment staff and investment approach.

Despite their common location and common name (J.P. Morgan Fleming Asset
Mgmt. U.K. Ltd.), the former Chase Fleming and J.P. Morgan entities continue
to operate as separate entities.  MARTIN PORTER has remained as the chief
investment officer at the former Fleming entity, while PABLO FORERO remains
chief investment officer of the former J.P. Morgan entity.  The reasons for
the separation lie in the firm's divergent client base.  Each institution
had too many large institutional clients that both sides feared an exodus of
clients if a particular service or investment approach were changed too
much.

Already, former Fleming and Chase brand names are being purged from the
firm's mutual fund line-up.  After first adding Chase to many of its funds,
the name will no longer be used along with former Fleming brand Save &
Prosper.  The former J.P. Morgan does not run any U.K. retail funds at the
moment, but may plan too, perhaps borrowing Fleming's distribution and
style.

The former J.P. Morgan entity uses an investment approach similar to its
stateside relative, using the proprietary DDM model.  The DDM is used to
calculate each company's dividend discount rate; companies are subsequently
ranked based on their DDR.  The managers attempt to exploit inefficiencies
in the market and purchase companies that are selling at a discount to their
intrinsic value.  In identifying such investments, portfolio managers
utilize fundamental analysis coupled with an emphasis on relative
valuations.  Investments are concentrated in the securities of companies
with the highest ranking within their respective sectors.

The former Fleming entity uses a larger, macro-economic analysis in stock
selection.  The firm assesses economic themes and attempts to construct a
portfolio of attractive growth stocks.  All overseas investments are subject
to BARRA risk analysis.  The firm's model portfolios, decided on by a
committee, are mandatory for all managers of discretionary balanced
portfolios.  Individual fund managers have no discretion over market timing
or asset allocation adjustments.  The former Flemings entity had endured
some unfortunate investment returns as a result of its growth-oriented
style. The merger with J.P. Morgan was widely hoped to help stem redemptions
by large pension funds and institutions.
