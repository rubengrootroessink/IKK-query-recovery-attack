Dear jason,


Throughout the course of the 2000-2001 Rockets season, viewers of Rockets telecasts on UPN 20 were asked to log on to rockets.com and submit a question to broadcasters Bill Worrell and Calvin Murphy.

Worrell and Murphy chose one question each game to answer live on-air, with all participants who submitted a question being entered into a drawing for the chance to win a Compaq computer and an autographed Rockets item.

Congratulations to Kris Martinak of Houston! Kris was selected from 2,754 participants as the winner of a Compaq Presario 7000 personal computer and a Rockets 2000-2001 Team Autographed Basketball.

Look for the Compaq Question of the Game contest again next Rockets season. In the meantime, be sure to visit rockets.com often this offseason to keep abreast of the latest Rockets developments.
