Dear Fellow Golfer:

    First, we would like to introduce ourselves. We are publishers
of a FREE newsletter called Net Golf Newsletter. This newsletter,
just like the handicap system, puts us on the same level as any
golf shop, dealer or club pro.  We don't mean playing ability, we're
talking about ELIMINATING HIGH PRICES BY CUTTING OUT
THE MIDDLEMAN!

    The information in the newsletters are not available to the public.
We are golfers, and we spend big money every year on golf clubs,
balls, clothing, trips, shoes and on and on - JUST LIKE YOU!  Well,
we all know how over priced this entire industry is right now - AND
WE HAVE DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!

WE NEED YOUR HELP!

    See, we're in the process of putting together some SUBSCRIBER
ONLY deals with some major manufacturers and distributors.  The
problem is we needa larger subscriber base to give us more bargaining
power - so we can cut the very, very best pricing with these guys.

 There's where you come in.

    Please subscribe to our FREE newsletter and take a look at the
deals that we put together for you (and I'd be lying if I didn't say
"us too").You should receive one, maybe two letters a week - all
golf related and all very worthwhile.  The typical letter will be filled
with rock bottom pricing and deals that you will not find anywhere
else.  Deals that most golf shops, travel agents and club pros wish
they could get their hands on!

                -   Up To 48% Off Brand Name Clubs!
                -   Unheard Of Golf Package Travel Deals!
                -   Discount Golf Shoes!
                -   Wholesale Pricing on Golf Balls!
                -   And much, much more!

    The best part is this letter is 100% FREE to you! All you have to
do is sit back and rake in the deals! Please take the time to click
on the link below and start taking advantage of some of the best
golf deals in the world.

    Take care and be on the look out for your first issue! Just click
