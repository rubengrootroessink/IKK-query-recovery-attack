 Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Giggles=
 Updated 11/16/01 Wheatley (knee) is out for Sunday's game with the Charger=
s. Charlie Garner will once again be Oakland's feature back. Zack Crockett =
may be used in goal-line situations.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Matty Update=
d 11/16/01 According to published reports, Wycheck is expected to play half=
 of Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That makes him a risky start from a F=
antasy perspective.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Mc=
Nair's status is still in question for Sunday's game against Cincinnati due=
 to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball during individual drills Frid=
ay, and according to published reports, is likely to play despite not being=
 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week as a result.  Emmitt Smit=
h , RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/16/01 Smith will return to the lineup Sun=
day against Philadelphia after missing two games with a sprained right knee=
. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Friday's practice that Smith wou=
ld "be ready to play the majority of the game." His return bumps Troy Hambr=
ick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend you use either back against the =
stingy Eagles rush defense.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11=
/16/01 Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury report on Friday and=
 is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Detroit.  However,=
 if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a larger league this week,=
 Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary is worth consideri=
ng as long as he's able to play.    Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Tori Updated 11/=
16/01 According to published reports, Weinke will be the starting quarterba=
ck for Sunday's game against San Francisco. However, he's not worth startin=
g on your Fantasy team.   Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - Giggles Updated 11/16=
/01 Culpepper is one pace for a good Fantasy season despite the lack of con=
sistency in Minnesota's offense this season. He's one of the better quarter=
backs in the league from a Fantasy perspective, and should be in your start=
ing lineup on a weekly basis.   Cris Carter , WR MIN - Tori Updated 11/16/0=
1 Carter's numbers may be down somewhat this season, but he's still too goo=
d to ever consider benching. The veteran has a knack for finding the end zo=
ne, and should have a good game against rookie CB Will Allen and the Giants=
' secondary on Monday night.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - Russell Updated 11/16/=
01 Moss is listed as probable for Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants due=
 to an ankle injury. He's been underachieving this season, but it's almost =
impossible to bench him based on his potential to post solid Fantasy numb! =
er! s.   Ricky Williams , RB NO - Bass/Hull Updated 11/16/01 Williams is on=
e of the better Fantasy backs in the league, and is a good player to use on=
 a weekly basis. He'll face an Indianapolis defense that has been underachi=
eving all season long, so Williams is a must-start.     Aaron Brooks , QB N=
O - Matty Updated 11/16/01 Brooks had a big game against San Francisco last=
 weekend, throwing for 347 yards and two scores. He may be a bit inconsiste=
nt this season, but his potential to post huge numbers makes it tough to be=
nch him, especially against a vulnerable Indianapolis defense.    Willie Ja=
ckson , WR NO - Martin Updated 11/16/01 Jackson put up a huge game against =
San Francisco last weekend, posting 11 catches and 167 yards receiving. He'=
ll face a questionable Indianapolis squad that is vulnerable to the pass in=
 Week 10, so starting Jackson this week is a solid option.   Stephen Davis =
, RB WAS - Bass/Hull Update! d ! 11/16/01 Davis has stepped up his play aft=
er beginning the season slowly. He's averaged 112 yards rushing over his la=
st four games, and is once again emerging as a reliable Fantasy player. Giv=
e him the start in Week 10 against a Denver defense that is vulnerable to h=
igh scoring games.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Bank=
s has played well of late, throwing five touchdowns in his last three games=
. He's got a good matchup this weekend against a Denver team that can be be=
aten through the air, but he's only worth considering in very deep Fantasy =
leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Westbro=
ok has been inconsistent this season, but he has caught three touchdown pas=
ses in his last four games. He'll face a Denver secondary this weekend that=
 is vulnerable at best, so starting him in deeper leagues is worth consider=
ing.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Gardner has been =
held in check in his last two games, catching only three passes for 38 yard=
s. He does have a favorable matchup this weekend against Denver, however, s=
o starting him is a good move.   ! Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Neal/McKay Upd=
ated 11/16/01 Hakim has been inconsistent in recent weeks, so starting him =
on your Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is right. He'll go up a=
gainst a tough New England secondary in Week Ten, so avoid using him outsid=
e of deeper leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - Tori Updated 11/16/01 Holt con=
tinues to put up consistent yardage totals, but he's only scored only three=
 touchdowns this season. He'll face a tough New England secondary this week=
end, but he's still worth starting on your Fantasy team based on his potent=
ial to put up solid numbers.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL - Frank Updated 11/16/0=
1 Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy totals this season, but he's still o=
ne of the better wideouts in the league. He'll face CB Ty Law and the formi=
dable New England secondary, but he's still worth starting based on his pot=
ential for big numbers.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Matty Updated 11/16/01 =
Faulk had a huge game against Carolina, proving that he is still the best F=
antasy player in the league. He's a must-start every week, and should post =
solid numbers in Week 10 against New England.   Ernie Conwell, TE STL - Fre=
e Agent Updated 11/16/01 Conwell has had a few down weeks, so starting him =
on your Fantasy team is somewhat of a gamble. With the lack of depth at tig=
ht end around the league, however, starting Conwell is something many Fanta=
sy owners will have no choice but to do.   Richard Huntley , RB CAR - Russe=
ll Updated 11/16/01 Huntley will be the likely starter this weekend against=
 San Francisco, but don't be surprised if he splits carries with Nick Going=
s. Avoid starting either back in Week 10 if at all possible.   Donald Hayes=
 , WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/16/01 Hayes had only two catches for 11 yards=
 last weekend against St. Louis. He's been unreliable for Fantasy owners th=
is season, so starting him is a real gamble.    Wesley Walls , TE CAR - Fre=
e Agent Updated 11/16/01 Walls has been held in check over the last three w=
eeks, but he's still one of the better tight ends in the league. He's had s=
ome success against San Francisco in the past, so starting him is advisable=
.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/16/01 Muhammad finally had=
 a somewhat productive game, catching six passes for 75 yards against St. L=
ouis. He's had some success in the past against this week's opponent, San F=
rancisco, so starting him is a decent move.   Brett Favre , QB GB - Frank U=
pdated 11/16/01 Favre has been one of the best Fantasy quarterbacks in the =
league this season. He'll face an Atlanta team on Sunday with a very vulner=
able secondary, so be sure to start Favre this week.   ! Bubba Franks  , TE=
 GB - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Franks may not put up huge yardage number=
s, but his seven touchdowns in eight games makes him a valuable Fantasy pla=
yer. Unless you have a better option on your roster, Franks is the type of =
tight end that should start on a weekly basis.    Bill Schroeder , WR GB - =
Frank Updated 11/16/01 Schroeder (ankle) is not listed on the NFL injury re=
port, and is expected to start on Sunday against Atlanta. He's a solid play=
 this week against Atlanta, whose secondary is vulnerable to strong passing=
 teams like Green Bay.   Reuben Droughns , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/1=
6/01 Droughns will likely split time with Lamont Warren in Detroit's backfi=
eld this weekend in James Stewart's absence. Neither back has much Fantasy =
value outside of deeper leagues, and starting them is a huge gamble.   Lamo=
nt Warren , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Warren will likely start i=
n place of the injured James Stewart on Sunday against Arizona. He's split =
carries with Reuben Droughns, and is only worth starting as a last resort i=
