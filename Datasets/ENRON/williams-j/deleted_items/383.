ews  Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - The Internet Potatoes Updated 11/19/01 Hilliar=
d continues to feel some soreness in his surgically-repaired toe, and it is=
 causing him to limp around a bit. He is still expected to start in Monday'=
s game against Minnesota, but playing on the artificial turf can't be good =
for his injury.   Reggie Kelly , TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Accor=
ding to published reports, Kelly (knee/ankle) should be able to return to a=
ction this weekend against Carolina. ! He! won't make much of a Fantasy imp=
act, however, so don't bother starting him in Week 11.   Chad Lewis , TE PH=
I - AARP Updated 11/19/01 Lewis suffered a slight knee injury during Sunday=
's 36-3 win over Dallas. The injury isn't considered serious, however, and =
Lewis is expected to start this weekend's game against Washington.   Steve =
McNair , QB TEN - Hatcher's Right Nut Updated 11/19/01 McNair was able to p=
lay with an injury to his right thumb, but the Tennessean says he will prob=
ably miss some practice time this week. He should still be able to play in =
the team's next game.   Packers , DT GB - The Internet Potatoes Updated 11/=
19/01 Safety LeRoy Butler suffered a fractured left shoulder blade during S=
unday's game against Atlanta. He is out indefinitely and could miss the rem=
ainder of the season. Chris Akins will likely take over the starting duties=
 in Butler's absence.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Hatcher's Right Nut Updated=
 11/19/01 McNair was able to play with an injury to his right thumb, but th=
e Tenne! ss! ean says he will probably miss some practice time this week. H=
e should still be able to play in the team's next game.  Az-Zahir Hakim , W=
R STL - Little Bambinos Updated 11/19/01 Hakim left Sunday's game against N=
ew England with an ankle injury. X-rays were negative, and Hakim is listed =
as day to day.   Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Wayne =
suffered a sprained knee on Sunday. His current status is day to day.  Rod =
Smith , WR DEN - Hatcher's Right Nut Updated 11/19/01 Smith (ankle) could n=
ot finish Sunday's game. His status for Thursday's game against Dallas is u=
nclear.  Terance Mathis , WR ATL - Hollowman Updated 11/19/01 Mathis has by=
 far his best game of the season, catching seven passes for 70 yards agains=
t Green Bay. He suffered a mild concussion in the game, but he's expected t=
o be fine for this weekend's contest at Carolina.   Jackie Harris , TE DAL =
- Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Harris suffered a strained right hamstring du=
ring Sunday's game against Philadelphia. He did not return to the contest, =
and is listed as day to day.   Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated =
11/19/01 Sanders had a huge game against Detroit on Sunday, catching seven =
passes for 127 yards and a touchdown. He injured his hamstring in the game,=
 however, and is listed as day to day.   Quincy Carter , QB DAL - Free Agen=
t Updated 11/19/01 Carter feels as though his hamstring has healed enough t=
hat he's ready to return to action. However, the Cowboys will start Ryan Le=
af for a few more weeks before Carter gets his starting job back. The team =
wants to evaluate Leaf in a few games this season to determine if he'll hav=
e any trade value in the offseason.   James Jackson , RB CLE - Threesome Up=
dated 11/19/01 Jackson told the Cleveland Plain-Dealer it was a coach's dec=
ision not to use him against the Ravens. Jackson had been suffering from an=
 ankle injury, but reports prior to gametime had indicated he might have be=
en able to play. With the sudden emergence of Benjamin Gay, Jackson's Fanta=
sy value might drop greatly.  Ryan Leaf , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19=
/01 Leaf had another terrible outing this weekend, but the Dallas Morning N=
ews is reporting that he'll remain the team's starting quarterback for the =
time being. However, he's no better than waiver wire fodder in Fantasy Foot=
ball.   Kevin Lockett , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Lockett left S=
unday's game against Denver in the first quarter due to a rib injury. His s=
tatus for next week's game against Philadelphia is uncertain at this time. =
  Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Banks, who suffered a c=
oncussion during Sunday's game against Denver, told the Washington Post tha=
t there's a "definite possibility" he would be ready in time for next weeke=
nd's game against Philadelphia. Kent Graham would start if Banks is unable =
to play, but neither QB is an attractive Fantasy option against the Eagles.=
   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Little Bambinos Updated 11/19/01 Smith left Sund=
ay's game against Philadelphia with a sprained knee. However, he is expecte=
d to be in the starting lineup when Dallas faces Denver on Thanksgiving Day=
.   Larry Foster , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Foster suffered an =
apparent leg injury during Sunday's game against Arizona. He is listed as d=

ffered a shoulder injury during Sunday's win over Arizona. He did not retur=

t Arizona. He is listed as day to day.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Threeso=
me Updated 11/18/01 Muhammad sprained his left shoulder in Sunday's game ag=
ainst the 49ers. His status for the Week 11 game against Atlanta is unclear=
.  Mike Anderson , RB DEN - Hatcher's Right Nut Updated 11/18/01 Anderson r=
ushed for only 31 yards on 13 carries against the Redskins. Olandis Gary ca=
rried the ball 10 times for 28 yards. It is apparent Anderson is no longer =
worthy of a starting spot on Fantasy team! s,! and Gary will continue to se=
e some work at his expense.  Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Free Agent Update=
d 11/18/01 Westbrook caught nine passes for 104 yards and a TD at Denver. O=
pposing defenses are focusing on rookie Rod Gardner, and Westbrook is getti=
ng open often after starting the year slowly.  Jake Plummer , QB ARI - Free=
 Agent Updated 11/18/01 Plummer threw for 334 yards, four TDs and was inter=
cepted once by Detroit. Such stellar performances are rare for Plummer, who=
 may not have a better game this season.  Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Road R=
age Updated 11/18/01 The awful Detroit defense limited Pittman to 81 rushin=
g yards on 23 carries. Don't start Pittman in any upcoming weeks unless you=
r team is very thin at RB..  David Sloan , TE DET - Free Agent Updated 11/1=
8/01 Sloan caught two TD passes for a total of three yards at Arizona. If y=
ou are desperate for help at TE, consider Sloan, who always gets regular lo=
oks from Charlie Batch.  Lamont Warren , RB DET - Hatcher's Right Nut Updat=
ed 11/18/01 Warren rushed for 32 yards and a TD at Arizona and caught 11 pa=
sses for 64 yards and a score. The Lions will continue to feature Warren on=
 third downs and near the goal line as a receiver, making him a good Fantas=
y backup for the rest of the year.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - AARP Updated 11/=
18/01 Dunn caught 12 passes for 138 yards against the Bears, but he rushed =
for only 12 yards and fumbled twice. Don't count on Dunn for consistently g=
ood Fantasy numbers during the next few weeks. He can be explosive, but he =
is also erratic.  Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Hatcher's Right Nut Updated 11=
/18/01 Johnson caught 12 passes for 89 yards against the Bears, but he fail=
ed to get in the end zone again. Don't depend on Johnson down the stretch u=
nless your team is very thin at wideout.  More Updates [IMAGE]  Copyright 2=
