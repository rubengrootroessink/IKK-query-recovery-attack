DIFFERENT STYLES, BILLION-DOLLAR HEDGE FUNDS: TUDOR AND DUQUESNE REPORT

For the third quarter ended September 30, 2001, Boston-based hedge fund
Tudor Investment Corporation reported ownership of 223 companies, valued at
$2.78 billion, a slight decrease from the previous quarter when the firm
reported $2.82 billion in equity assets under management invested in a
portfolio of 196 companies.  The firm has managed to keep a large asset base
over the years despite market fluctuations and its aggressive growth style.


Duquesne Capital Management, the firm started by George Soros lieutenant
STANEY DRUCKENMILLER, has also weathered numerous difficult markets but
using a GARP oriented style that often reflected that of Soros. For the
third quarter ended September 30, 2001, Pittsburgh, PA-based hedge fund
Duquesne Capital Management reported ownership of 120 companies, valued at
$1.10 billion, a decrease from the previous quarter when the firm reported
ownership of 114 companies, valued at $1.26 billion.

Despite the tumultuous market, both funds have managed to keep their equity
assets under management within relatively narrow margins, but nearly always
in the billions.  Despite different styles, both firms seemed to increase
their bullishness on technology.

cyclicals, health care, and technology while moving away from financials,

CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN HEDGE FUND

When JULIAN H. ROBERTSON, JR. decided to wind-down his legendary Tiger
Management, L.L.C., he became a fixture on television, explaining that the
economy had changed too greatly for his style of investment and that he was
not prepared to change the funds' investment styles to adapt to momentum
technology investing. Yet now it appears that Robertson, through an old
acquaintance, has moved into technology investments, just when technology
and the "New Economy" appear to be in their darkest hour.   Indeed, it seems
ironic even that Robertson, a name synonymous with value oriented investment
would be involved in something resembling the "New Economy," a concept he
often derided as a Ponzi scheme.

Tiger Technology, L.P. began operations on March 1, 2001.  The fund's
general partner is CHARLES P. COLEMAN III, who is joined by a three-member
investment team that is responsible for the coverage of various technology
related industries.  The team includes Coleman, the former partner and
assistant portfolio manager with Tiger Management LLC.   His primary
coverage is in the software and Internet sectors, an area he covered while
at Banc of America Securities (then Montgomery Securities).  JONATHAN
LOCKER, a research analyst, joined the firm after serving as a financial
analyst in the Technology Mergers and Acquisitions Group at Morgan Stanley &
Co.  He primarily covers the communications sector.  KARTHIK SARMA, a
research analyst, is the third member of the investment team.  Sarma's
primary coverage includes the software and service sector, fields he worked
with while a junior engagement manager at McKinsey & Company.

The team members meet regularly with company management and monitor sales
activity in different technology end-markets and spends significant time
modeling and performing valuation analysis on portfolio investments.  The
fund screens for companies with sound business models in attractive markets,
forward-looking management teams with superior operational skills, strong
cash flows contributing to solid balance sheets, reasonable Wall Street
earnings expectations and attractive valuations.  The firm's investment team
also seeks to exploit its contacts in the technology field to gain greater
insights on technology related industries.

When looking for short opportunities, the firm looks for companies with poor
management teams, under-performing products, deteriorating financial
performance, and unrealistic earning expectations.  The fund also attempts
to maintain between 5% and 50% of its exposure in international equities.

Tiger is also heavily marketing two other long/short funds, Tiger Sharks
Partners LP and the Tiger Asia Fund LP.  THOMAS FACCIOLA and MICHAEL SEARS
are reportedly managing the Tiger Sharks fund while BILL HWANG is currently
responsible for the Tiger Asia fund.  At present, Tiger Management provides
administrative services including accounting, settlement, and trading for
the funds.

A TURBULENT QUARTER FOR ZWEIG-DIMENNA

According to the 13F filed for the quarter ended September 30, 2001, the
firm managed approximately $3.0 billion in equity assets invested in a
portfolio of 254 companies.  This was a decrease from the previous quarter
in which the firm reported $4.5 billion in equity assets invested in a
portfolio of 256 companies.  This appears to be a diffiucult time for
Zweig-DiMenna, which according to the Wall Street Journal on September 26,
2001, was down approximately about 25%.

Financials and technology garnered the lion's share of the portfolio; both
sectors represented approximately 25.9% of the portfolio.  Holdings in the
consumer cyclicals, diversified and health care sectors followed behind, all
hovering around 10.0%.

Over the course of the third quarter, the firm's holdings in the energy
sector decreased by approximately $149.0 million. In the second quarter of
2001, the sector comprised approximately 5.7% of the portfolio; by the end
of the third quarter the sector represented only 1.1%. Holdings in the
consumer staples sector also decreased. At the end of the third quarter,
this sector represented only 5.2%, the quarter before 8.3% of the portfolio
was invested in consumer staples.

Top five holdings according to the 13F filed for the quarter ended September
30, 2001 included: Philip Morris Cos Inc. [MO] with 3,379,700 shares valued
at $163.2 million; Everest Reinsurance Group Ltd. [RE] with 1,943,000 shares
valued at $125.7 million; Freddie Mac [FRE] with 1,527,400 shares valued at

portfolio of 128 companies.

The most heavily weighted sectors included financials (25.3%), consumer
cyclicals (19.9%), consumer staples (17.0%), technology (14.5%), and
