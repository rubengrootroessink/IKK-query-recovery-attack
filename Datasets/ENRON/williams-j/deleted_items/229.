years.  The Wachovia transaction is three times larger than any integration
attempted to date and is twice as large as the combined assets of all

members as well as First Union.

CAXTON BOOSTS ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT

For the quarter ended March 31, 2001, Bruce Kovner's Caxton Corporation
reported $9.8 billion in equity assets invested in a portfolio of 1,799
stocks. The firm's assets increased approximately $2.4 billion from the
previous quarter in which the firm reported $7.4 billion in equity assets
invested in a portfolio of 1,841 companies.

Caxton's most heavily weighted sectors remained relatively consistent from
the fourth quarter of 2000 to the first quarter of 2001.  For the quarter
ended March 31, 2001, technology held the top spot with 20.3%.  Other
heavily weighted sectors included consumer cyclicals (14.3%), financials
(14.0%), consumer staples (9.4%), and capital goods (7.8%).

Top holdings for the quarter ended March 31, 2001 included: Freddie Mac
[FRE] with 848,000 shares valued at $55.0 million; Tyco International Ltd.
[TYC] with 1,190,396 shares valued at $51.5 million; Quaker Oats Co. [OAT]
with 515,300 shares valued at $50.0 million; Honeywell International Inc.
[HON] with 1,207,100 shares valued at $49.2 million; and, Fannie Mae [FNM]
with 612,000 shares valued at $48.7 million.

In addition to the new positions in Freddie Mac, Tyco, and Fannie Mae, the
firm also established new stakes in American Home Products Corp. [AHP] with
821,600 shares valued at $48.3 million and Tosco Corp. [TOS] with 856,100
shares valued at $36.6 million.

-----------------------------------------------------------

TUDOR REDUCES EXPOSURE TO TECHNOLOGY

For the quarter ended March 31, 2001, Tudor Investment Corporation reported
approximately $2.3 billion in equity assets invested in a portfolio of 173
companies.  This was a decrease from the previous quarter in which the firm
reported approximately $3.1 billion in equity assets invested in a portfolio
of 240 companies.

Tudor's most heavily weighted sectors for the quarter included consumer
cyclicals with 20.7%, consumer staples with 15.6%, health care with 13.5%,
technology with 8.9%, and diversified with 8.9%.  Since December 31, 1999,
when the technology portion of Tudor's portfolio comprised approximately
55.8%, the firm has gradually been trimming its allocation to the sector.
The biggest drop came between June 30, 2000 and September 30, 2000, when the
firm's 13F reported that technology holdings had dropped from 43.8% to
24.0%.  Eight months later, holdings are only a third of what they once
were, reflecting the markets souring on the tech sector.

Top holdings for the quarter included: Becton Dickinson & Co. [BDX] with
3,192,900 shares valued at $112.8 million; Philip Morris Cos. Inc. [MO] with
2,021,400 shares valued at $95.9 million; Nasdaq 100 Trust [QQQ] with

million; Albertsons Inc. [ABS] with 1,416,400 shares valued at $45.1
million; American International Group Inc. [AIG] with 505,000 shares valued
at $40.7 million; and, AnnTaylor Stores [ANN] with 1,345,100 shares valued
at $35.7 million.

-----------------------------------------------------------

For the quarter ended March 31, 2001, Viking Global Investors, the firm
founded by former Tiger Management Managing Director O. Andreas Halvorsen,
reported $1.47 billion in equity assets invested in a portfolio of 55
companies.  This was a minimal decrease from the previous quarter in which
the firm reported approximately $1.49 billion in equity assets invested in a
portfolio of 52 companies.

Viking Global remains fairly concentrated in a few select sectors, a method
that has clearly worked well for the firm so far.  According to a February
2001 article in Business Week, the firm was up approximately 89% last year
after fees.  For the quarter ended March 31, 2001, the firm's most heavily
weighted sectors included communication services with 36.9%, consumer
cyclicals with 34.1%, consumer staples with 10.9%, financials with 9.8%, and
technology with 4.1%.

Top holdings for the quarter included Sprint Corp. (PCS) [PCS] with
8,502,200 shares valued at $161.5 million; Centurytel Inc. [CTL] with
4,095,400 shares valued at $117.7 million; BCE Inc. [BCE] with 4,589,600
shares valued at $103.3 million; Ross Stores Inc. [ROST] with 4,103,500
shares valued at $76.9 million; and TJX Cos. Inc. [TJX] with 2,181,800
shares valued at $69.8 million.

Two out of the top three new positions and three out of the top five largest
buys were from the communication services sector.  New holdings for the
quarter included Clear Channel Communications Inc. [CCU] with 810,00 shares
valued at $44.1 million; AT & T [T] with 1,298,000 shares valued at $27.6
million; SBC Communications Inc. [SBC] with 587,000 shares valued at $26.2
million; McDonalds Corp. [MCD] with 931,000 shares valued at $24.7 million;
and, Dollar General Corp. [DG] with 1,141,700 shares valued at $23.3
million.

-------------------------------------------------------
DIGITAL CENTURY STICKS TO TECHNOLOGY
For the first quarter ended March 31, 2001, Digital Century reported
ownership of 24 companies valued at $294.8 million, a marked decrease from
the previous quarter when the firm reported ownership of 30 companies valued
at $552.5 million.  As recently as September 30, 2000, the firm had reported
ownership of 29 companies valued at $889.8 million.
Throughout recent quarters, the firm's portfolio P/E ratio has been nearly
double that of the S&P 500.  As many other firms' portfolio P/Es have fallen
in the wake of the dot-com boom, Digital Century's P/E has remained high,
seemingly making it an aggressive, aggressive growth player.  The firm, long
a technology player, was founded in 1998 by former Goldman Sachs
semiconductor analyst RAJIV CHAUDHRI to focus on the booming tech sector.
Overall, the firm had 78.0% of its holdings invested in the technology
sector for the first quarter.
In its most recent quarter, the firm made small moves into computer
software, specialty communications, and communications.  Companies in the
electronics, entertainment, and services (commercial consumer) decreased the
largest amount.
Top five holdings for the quarter ended March 31, 2001 included: eBay Inc.
[EBAY] with 1,818,000 shares (valued at $65.8 million); AOL Time Warner Inc.
[AOL] with 1,414,000 shares (valued at $56.8 million); Exodus Communications
Inc. [EXDS] with 1,586,000 shares (valued at $17.0 million); Globespan Inc.
[GSPN] with 760,000 shares (valued at $16.6 million); and, BEA Systems Inc.
[BEAS] with 425,000 shares (valued at $12.5 million).
Interestingly, the firm took no new positions for the quarter.  The firm
did, however, add to preexisting positions.  Companies added to in the
firm's portfolio included: Exodus Communications [EXDS]; Veritas Software
Corp. [VRTS] with 266,650 shares (valued at $12.3 million); BEA Systems Inc.
[BEAS]; Yahoo Inc. [YHOO] with 734,000 shares (valued at $11.6 million);
and, Globespan Inc. [GSPN].

SECOND CURVE MOVES INTO REGIONAL BANKS

For the first quarter ended March 31, 2001, Second Curve Capital reported
ownership of 25 companies valued at $279.6 million, an increase from the
previous quarter when the firm reported ownership of 25 companies valued at
$213.5 million.  Former Tiger Management and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette
banking analyst Thomas K. Brown founded the firm in 2000.  The firm's
investments reflect Brown's background; the firm invests primarily in the
financials sector.

In its most recent filing, financials account for 98.5% of the portfolio,
with a miniscule 1.5% invested in technology.  The top three micro sector
holdings included consumer finance (29.7%), savings & loan companies
(27.6%), and banks (regional) (20.4%).  Over the quarter, the firm rotated
out of diversified financial companies and brokerages while moving into more
traditional banking stocks including companies in the banks (regional),
banks (money center), and consumer finance sectors.

Brown has gained some notoriety in the news from his very public criticism
of Bank of America.  The New York Times referred to Brown as a "bomb
thrower" when describing his fervent criticism of Bank of America Corp.'s
management.  In frequent postings to his website, bankstocks.com, Brown has
made numerous negative postings, including one titled "Bank of America: The
Reign of Terror Continues," and has directly criticized Bank of America CEO
Hugh McColl.  Interestingly enough, Second Curve's largest purchase for the
quarter was 300,148 shares of Bank of America.

Top five new purchases included: Bank of America Corp. [BAC] with 300,148
shares (valued at $16.4 million); Sovereign Bancorp Inc. [SVRN] with
1,926,645 shares (valued at $16.3 million); First Union Corp. [FTU] with
481,247 shares (valued at $15.9 million); Americredit Corp. [ACF] with
118,072 shares (valued at $3.8 million); and, Hibernia Corp. (Cl A) [HIB]
with 260,226 shares (valued at $3.6 million).

Top five holdings for the quarter ended March 31, 2001 included: Household
International Inc. [HI] with 1,009,557 shares (valued at $59.8 million); TCF
Financial [TCB] with 712,551 shares (valued at $26.9 million); Capital One
Financial Corp. [COF] with 352,975 shares (valued at $19.6 million); Pacific
Century Financial Corp. [BOH] with 873,664 shares (valued at $16.6 million);
and, Bank of America Corp. [BAC] with 300,148 shares (valued at $16.4
million).

ABN AMRO EXPANDS EQUITY RESEARCH TEAM THROUGH ACQUISITION OF ING BARINGS

ABN AMRO announced on January 30, 2001 that it reached an agreement with ING
Group to purchase the prime brokerage, corporate finance, domestic equities,
and futures and options businesses of ING Barings in North America for
$275.0 million.  This acquisition assisted ABN AMRO in its effort to offer a
globally integrated corporate and investment banking service for its
corporate, financial institution and public sector clients.

ABN AMRO completed the acquisition of ING Barings in North America on April
30, 2001.  The acquisition strengthened ABN AMRO's investment banking and
research divisions in a number of sectors, including media, energy, telecom,
industrial manufacturing and healthcare, in addition to rounding out the
firm's existing sector coverage.  The number of U.S. stocks followed by ABN
AMRO will double from their current levels. The acquisition also enables the
firm to significantly boost its trading capacity over the next two years.

Over 1,300 of ING Barings' personnel are expected to transfer with the sale
of the U.S. investment banking business to ABN AMRO.   The majority of ING
Barings' former U.S. research staff has been transferred to ABN AMRO. ABN
AMRO is also expecting to dismiss approximately 1000 employees globally,
with about 100 staff dismissals within the U.S. investment banking business
it bought from ING Barings.

ING Group was intent on greatly reducing its North American investment
banking presence, as a result of stiffer competition from the larger
recently consolidated investment banking entities that were created over the
past two years.  ING remains committed to investment banking in Europe, Asia
and Latin America.  In addition, the firm's asset management divisions,
Baring Asset Management and ING Furman Selz Asset Management, will continue
to operate as a part of ING's global asset management division.

Many members of the firm's equity research team have chosen to pursue
opportunities elsewhere, including: FRANK MARSALA, formerly a vice president
and senior wireless telecommunications analyst with ING Barings, who joined
Robertson Stephens; ROBERT J. HOEHN, ING Barings' former director of equity
research, who joined Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein as the director of North
American equity research, and THOMAS LAURIA, a former telecommunications
equipment analyst with ING Barings LLC.
