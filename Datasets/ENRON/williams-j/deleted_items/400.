, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Tony Martin , WR ATL - Fre=
e Agent Updated 11/21/01 Martin hasn't been a reliable Fantasy player at al=
l this season, but he could have a decent outing against Carolina. The Pant=
hers secondary is one of the worst in the league, so starting Martin in dee=
per Fantasy leagues may be worth considering.   Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Fr=
ee Agent Updated 11/21/01 Sanders is dealing with two tight hamstrings, but=
 he's expected to play on Sunday against San Diego. The Chargers' secondary=
 has! n'! t been playing well of late, so giving Sanders some consideration=
 in deeper leagues is advisable.   David Boston , WR ARI - Bass/Hull Update=
d 11/21/01 Boston has become one of the premier wide receivers in Fantasy F=
ootball. He's posted three touchdowns and 217 yards receiving in his last t=
wo games, and should have another solid game vs. San Diego in Week 11.   To=
m Brady , QB NE - Martin Updated 11/21/01 Patriots Head Coach Bill Belichic=
k announced late Monday that Brady will remain the starting quarterback for=
 the remainder of the season, barring injury. This relegates Drew Bledsoe t=
o a backup role and makes him useless from a Fantasy perspective. Brady mig=
ht have his hands full passing against the Saints on Sunday, but he is a fa=
irly safe weekly starter otherwise.   Dolphins , DT MIA - Martin Updated 11=
/21/01 Defensive tackle Daryl Gardener could miss the remainder of the seas=
on due to a fragmented disc in his back. He will miss at least one month to=
 rest and rehabilitate the injury before being re-evaluated. Gardener's abs=
ence hurts the Dolphins' rush defense, which might be burned a little more =
by opposing running backs in the upcoming weeks.!  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - =
Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Minnis is unlikely to be available for Sunday's=
 game against Seattle due to the sprained ankle he suffered during a Nov. 1=
1 game against the Jets. He will be replaced by Chris Thomas in the lineup =
at split end, and you should keep him reserved for this week.  Mark Brunell=
 , QB JAC - JWillie Updated 11/21/01 Brunell's nagging leg injury might sid=
eline him for Sunday's game against Baltimore. He decided about two hours b=
efore last Sunday's kickoff that he couldn't play against Pittsburgh due to=
 a strained right quadriceps. Jonathan Quinn has been preparing as if he wi=
ll start the game, so right now you shouldn't count on Brunell this week as=
 you set your lineups.  Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Martin Updated 11/21/01 Tayl=
or received a second medical opinion Tuesday that indicated his severe groi=
n injury could keep him out up to three months and possibly the remainder o=
f the season, according to the Florida Times-Union. The diagnosis was that =
the injury still has not healed and will need more time to become healthy, =
and in the meantime Taylor has developed pain i! n ! his hip, a side effect=
 of the injury. It's sounding more and more like Taylor will not play again=
 this Fantasy season, although you should probably hold onto him until a fi=
nal decision is reached, provided you have a deep enough bench.  Rod Smith =
, WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/21/01 Smith's sprained ankle was not healed eno=
ugh for him to practice on Tuesday, and there is a real chance he might mis=
s Thursday's game against Dallas. He suffered the injury Nov. 11, and aggra=
vated it during Sunday's game. You should probably play it safe and keep Sm=
ith on your bench for this week. Temper your expectations for the entire Br=
oncos' offense as well - the Cowboys' D isn't the pushover many believed it=
 would be prior to the season.  Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - JWillie Updated =
11/20/01 With Ricky Watters expected to miss another two to three weeks, Al=
exander will remain the focal point of many contending Fantasy teams during=
 their charge to the playoffs. He should roll up some fine numbers against =
the Chiefs this week.  Tom Brady , QB NE - Martin Updated 11/20/01 The Patr=
iots will stick with Brady for now, and Drew Bledsoe will remain the team's=
 No. 2 QB. "I don't see any changes this week," coach Bill Belichick said. =
Brady is a solid Fantasy starter right now, but add Bledsoe to your ro! st!=
 er as an insurance policy if you can.  Jonathan Quinn , QB JAC - Free Agen=
t Updated 11/20/01 Quinn may have to start in place of Mark Brunell (quadri=
ceps) again this week. Brunell's status is still unclear for Sunday's game.=
  Ricky Watters , RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Watters' shoulder ha=
s not sufficiently healed enough for him to practice, says the Seattle Time=
s . He is not expected to return for another two to three weeks, meaning Sh=
aun Alexander will continue to be a key performer for many Fantasy teams as=
 the postseason comes into view.  Doug Flutie , QB SD - Russell Updated 11/=
20/01 Mike Riley told the San Diego Union-Tribune there is no QB controvers=
y involving Flutie and rookie Drew Brees. "Doug is going to be our quarterb=
ack," he said. "You can talk about controversy all you want, but there is n=
one within this building. He is our quarterback. He will start. He will get=
 us the next win the next week." Still, Flutie is not playing well enought =
to satisfy most Fantasy owners.  Mark Bruener , TE PIT - Free Agent Updated=
 11/20/01 Bruener will miss the rest of the season after undergoing shoulde=
r injury. His loss may adversely affect Jerome Bettis' statistics, because =
Bruener is widely regarded as the best run-blocking tight end in football. =
 Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Giggles Updated 11/20/01 Wheatley told the Cont=
ra-Costa Times he is no longer being bothered by a knee injury. He expects =
to play on Sunday.  Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Kin=
ney (calf) may play this week after missing three games. He was expected to=
 return to practice early this week.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Matty Update=
d 11/20/01 Wycheck (calf) will be limited in practice this week. He may be =
a risky start in Week 11.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20=
/01 The Tennessean says McNair's hand was sore when he arrived at the team'=
s practice facility on Monday. Jeff Fisher now says he doesn't expect him t=
o miss any practice time this week.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - JWillie U=
pdated 11/20/01 Alexander (ribs) has returned to practice. He is expected t=
o start against Seattle.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/=
01 Minnis (ankle) is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game. Larry Parker may=
 have to start in his place,  Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11=
/20/01  Wayne has a sprained knee ligament, and is doubtful for Sunday's ga=
me against New Orleans. Terrence Wilkins may have to start in his place.  J=
erome Pathon , WR IND - Tori Updated 11/20/01 Pathon (foot) is done for the=
 season. He will be put on injured reserve. Reggie Wayne (knee) is also hur=
ting, meaning Terrence Wilkins might have to be moved back into the startin=
g lineup.   Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Tori Updated 11/20/01 Dave Wannstedt tol=
d the Miami Herald there is no QB controversy surrounding Fielder and backu=
p Ray right now. ``Th! at! 's kind of hypothetical,'' he said. ``Jay is the=
 starter, and my only comment is we're going to get it squared away and pla=
y turnover-free football.''  Rod Smith , WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/20/01 Mi=
ke Shanahan said he does not know if Smith (ankle) will be sufficiently hea=
led to play in Thursday's game against the Cowboys. "We'll get a chance to =
evaluate that during the week and see," Shanahan told the Denver Post. "If =
he can help our football team, he'll play. If he's in a situation where he =
can't perform at the level that we think can help our team, then we'll keep=
 him out and put somebody else in."   ! Be! njamin Gay  , RB CLE - Free Age=
nt Updated 11/20/01 The Cleveland Plain-Dealer says Butch Davis won't indic=
ate how much Gay will play in the near future. "We'll try to get him involv=
ed in some of the games," Davis said. "We'll see."   Kevin Lockett , WR WAS=
 - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Lockett, who suffered a rib injury last week=
end against Denver, expects to play on Sunday against Philadelphia. However=
, the wide receiver has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point.   =
Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01! Barring any setbacks, Ba=
nks will start Sunday's game against Philadelphia. Banks, who suffered a co=
ncussion last weekend vs. Denver, hasn't been feeling any after effects of =
the injury and should be under center for the 'Skins.   Jacquez Green , WR =
TB - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Green (abdomen) is expected to return to p=
ractice on Wednesday at full strength. He's been inconsistent this season, =
and is best used when the matchup is favorable.   Terrell Owens , WR SF - M=
artin Updated 11/20/01 Owens suffered a sprained left knee and ankle during=
 the overtime session of last weekend's game against Carolina. The injuries=
 aren't considered serious, however, and Owens is expected to be in the sta=
rting lineup on Sunday Indianapolis.   More Updates  Teams, Rosters  [IMAGE=
