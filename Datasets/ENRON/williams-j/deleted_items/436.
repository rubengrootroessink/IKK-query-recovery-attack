, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Keenan McCardell , WR JAC =
- Neal/McKay Updated 11/25/01 McCardell caught six passes for 80 yards agai=
nst Baltimore. He has certainly raised the level of his play in recent week=
s, and should be a solid Fantasy player down the stretch as opponents conti=
nue to focus on Jimmy Smith.  Stacey Mack , RB JAC - Hunter Updated 11/25/0=
1 Mack rushed for 50 yards and two TDs and caught five passes for 45 yards =
against the Ravens. Despite his good outing, Mack remains a Fantasy risk be=
caus! e ! of his inconsistency.   Qadry Ismail , WR BAL - Bass/Hull Updated=
 11/25/01 The Jaguars held Ismail to three catches for 44 yards. Despite hi=
s quiet statistical performance, Ismail remains a must-start player for any=
 Fantasy team. He is one of the most complete and underrated receivers in t=
he AFC.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Tori Updated 11/25/01 Brookins rushed fo=
r 82 yards and two TDs at Jacksonville, but also lost a fumble. The rookie =
RB is talented, but too erratic to be a Fantasy starter on most teams right=
 now.  Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Neal/McKay Updated 11/25/01 Dayne carried the b=
all six times for 26 yards against Oakland. Don't depend on him for good nu=
mbers during the remainder of the season.  Tiki Barber , RB NYG - Neal/McKa=
y Updated 11/25/01 Barber rushed for 124 yards and a TD against Oakland, an=
d caught five passes for 41 yards. He has played well recently, although hi=
s owners would still like to see him score on a more consistent basis.  LaD=
ainian Tomlinson , RB SD - Hunter Updated 11/25/01 Tomlinson was held out o=
f the end zone, but he had a good day against Arizona nonetheless. The rook=
ie tailback had 145 scrimmage yards, including 13 receptions, in San Diego'=
s 20-17 loss.   Doug Flutie , QB SD - Russell Updated 11/25/01 Flutie had a=
 solid game, throwing for 308 yards and two touchdowns against Arizona. How=
ever, he's only worth starting when the matchup is to his advantage.   Jake=
 Plummer , QB ARI - Frank Updated 11/25/01 Plummer had a decent outing on S=
unday, posting 241 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. Plummer, who al=
so threw two picks, is only a reserve Fantasy quarterback at best.   David =
Boston , WR ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 11/25/01 Boston had another outstanding=
 game, catching six passes for 121 yards and a touchdown against San Diego.=
 He's one of the most reliable Fantasy receivers in the league, and is wort=
h starting on a weekly basis.   Willie Jackson , WR NO - Martin Updated 11/=
25/01 Jackson had a go! od! outing against New England, catching five catch=
es for 78 yards and a touchdown. He may not be the most dependable Fantasy =
receiver, but he is worth starting in deeper leagues.   Joe Horn , WR NO - =
Matty Updated 11/25/01 Horn had another solid outing, catching four passes =
for 97 yards against New England. He's been a very dependable receiver in r=
ecent weeks and is worth starting on a weekly basis.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB =
OAK - Giggles Updated 11/25/01 In his return from a knee injury, Wheatley c=
arried the ball five times for 17 yards. Zack Crockett was used more often =
in short-yardage packages, and Wheatley does not appear capable of starting=
 for any Fantasy team in the near future. Even when he is fully healthy, he=
 may not be able to take many carries away from Charlie Garner.  Antowain S=
mith , RB NE - JWillie Updated 11/25/01 Smith had 153 yards of total offens=
e and two touchdowns against New Orleans. After a slow start, Smith has bec=
ome a pretty good weekly option for Fantasy Footballers  Tom Brady , QB NE =
- Martin Updated 11/25/01Brady put up huge numbers against New Orleans, pos=
ting 258 yards passing and four touchdowns. He's become a pretty reliable F=
antasy player, and his performance will likely keep Drew Bledsoe on the Pat=
riots' bench for another week.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Martin Updated 11/25=
/01 Gannon threw for 221 yards, three TDs and no interceptions against the =
Giants. He ignored rain-soaked conditions, and continued to look like the m=
ost reliable QB in Fantasy Football.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent U=
pdated 11/25/01 ! Sanders left Sunday's game against San Diego after re-agg=
ravating a hamstring injury. He was replaced by MarTay Jenkins, and did not=
 return to the game.  Eric Moulds , WR BUF - Bass/Hull Updated 11/25/01 Mou=
lds finally emerged from an extended slump, catching six passes for 196 yar=
ds and two TDs against Miami. He also lost a fumble, and Fantasy owners sho=
uld still remember that Moulds has been a disappointment for most of the ye=
ar. Don't be surprised if he follows his best outing of the year with a med=
iocre performance.  Alex Van Pelt , QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Va=
n Pelt had another fine game, throwing for 309 yards, three TDs and one int=
erception. He is definitely merits strong Fantasy consideration as long as =
he remains in Buffalo's starting lineup.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Matty U=
pdated 11/25/01 Gadsden caught eight passes for 118 yards at Buffalo. He di=
d not catch a TD pass, though, and lost a fumble. Gadsden is too unreliable=
 to start for most Fantasy teams in these important final weeks.  Jay Fiedl=
er , QB MIA - Tori Updated 11/25/01 Fiedler threw for 262 yards, three TDs =
and no interceptions at Buffalo. His performance may have quieted talk of a=
 QB controversy, but Fiedler is still too inconsistent to be a dependable F=
antasy QB.  Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - Russell Updated 11/25/01 The Redskins=
 held McNabb to 92 passing yards and 39 rushing yards, with no TDs or inter=
ceptions. Expect the Philadelphia QB to rebound quickly from such a quiet p=
erformance.  James Thrash , WR PHI - Frank Updated 11/25/01 Thrash caught f=
our passes for 32 yards against Washington. He is too inco! ns! istent to b=
e a starter on better Fantasy teams as the playoffs approach.   Rod Gardner=
 , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Gardner caught four passes for only=
 33 yards on Sunday. The rookie has slowed down considerably in the past fe=
w weeks, and now seems like a risk during the Fantasy homestretch.   Ki-Jan=
a Carter , RB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Carter saw extensive action=
 on Sunday as Stephen Davis played through back problems. He carried 18 tim=
es for 56 yards, and is a good backup to have if Davis in on your Fantasy t=
eam. Davis has always been known to battle minor injuries.  Isaac Byrd , WR=
 CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Byrd started in place of the injured Muh=
sin Muhammad on Sunday. He posted decent Fantasy numbers in Muhammad's abse=
nce, catching five passes for 69 yards in Carolina's 10-7 loss to Atlanta. =
  Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/25/01 Muhammad missed Sun! d=
a! y's game against Atlanta due to a shoulder injury. His status for next w=
eekend's game against New Orleans is unknown at this time.   Derrick Alexan=
der , WR KC - JWillie Updated 11/25/01 Alexander caught two passes for 56 y=
ards in his return from a rib injury. He was not open often, and Alexander =
may continue to be a Fantasy disappointment if he stays healthy.  Chris Cha=
ndler , QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Chandler had a subpar game on =
Sunday, throwing for only 132 yards against Carolina. The Falcons chose to =
attack Carolina with their ground game, which was the reason for Chandler's=
 poor Fantasy numbers.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - JWillie Updated 11/25/=
01 Alexander caught two passes for 56 yards in his return from a rib injury=
. He was not open often, and Alexander may continue to be a Fantasy disappo=
intment if he stays healthy.  More Updates  Transactions, View  [IMAGE]    =
