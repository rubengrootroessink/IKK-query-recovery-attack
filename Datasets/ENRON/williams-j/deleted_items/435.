, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Keenan McCardell , WR JAC =
- Little Bambinos Updated 11/25/01 McCardell caught six passes for 80 yards=
 against Baltimore. He has certainly raised the level of his play in recent=
 weeks, and should be a solid Fantasy player down the stretch as opponents =
continue to focus on Jimmy Smith.  Stacey Mack , RB JAC - Hollowman Updated=
 11/25/01 Mack rushed for 50 yards and two TDs and caught five passes for 4=
5 yards against the Ravens. Despite his good outing, Mack remains a Fantasy=
 risk ! be! cause of his inconsistency.   Qadry Ismail , WR BAL - Threesome=
 Updated 11/25/01 The Jaguars held Ismail to three catches for 44 yards. De=
spite his quiet statistical performance, Ismail remains a must-start player=
 for any Fantasy team. He is one of the most complete and underrated receiv=
ers in the AFC.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Threesome Updated 11/25/01 Brook=
ins rushed for 82 yards and two TDs at Jacksonville, but also lost a fumble=
. The rookie RB is talented, but too erratic to be a Fantasy starter on mos=
t teams right now. ! Ron Dayne , RB NYG - The Internet Potatoes Updated 11/=
25/01 Dayne carried the ball six times for 26 yards against Oakland. Don't =
depend on him for good numbers during the remainder of the season.  Tiki Ba=
rber , RB NYG - The Flounders Updated 11/25/01 Barber rushed for 124 yards =
and a TD against Oakland, and caught five passes for 41 yards. He has playe=
d well recently, although his owners would still like to see him score on a=
 more consistent basis.  LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - The Internet Potatoe=
s Updated 11/25/01 Tomlinson was held out of the end zone, but he had a goo=
d day against Arizona nonetheless. The rookie tailback had 145 scrimmage ya=
rds, including 13 receptions, in San Diego's 20-17 loss.   Doug Flutie , QB=
 SD - The Internet Potatoes Updated 11/25/01 Flutie had a solid game, throw=
ing for 308 yards and two touchdowns against Arizona. However, he's only wo=
rth starting when the matchup is to his advantage.   Jake Plummer , QB ARI =
- Free Agent! ! Updated 11/25/01 Plummer had a decent outing on Sunday, pos=
ting 241 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. Plummer, who also threw t=
wo picks, is only a reserve Fantasy quarterback at best.   David Boston , W=
R ARI - Cocked and Locked Updated 11/25/01 Boston had another outstanding g=
ame, catching six passes for 121 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. H=
e's one of the most reliable Fantasy receivers in the league, and is worth =
starting on a weekly basis.   Willie Jackson , WR NO - Cocked and Locked Up=
dated 11/25/01 Jackson had a good outing against New England, catching five=
 catches for 78 yards and a touchdown. He may not be the most dependable Fa=
ntasy receiver, but he is worth starting in deeper leagues.   Joe Horn , WR=
 NO - Little Bambinos Updated 11/25/01 Horn had another solid outing, catch=
ing four passes for 97 yards against New England. He's been a very dependab=
le receiver in recent weeks and is worth starting on a weekly basis.  Tyron=
e Wheatley , RB OAK - Hatcher's Right Nut Updated 11/25/01 In his return fr=
om a knee injury, Wheatley carried the ball five times for 17 yards. Zack C=
rockett was used more often in short-yardage packages, and Wheatley does no=
t appear capable of starting for any Fantasy team in the near future. Even =
when he is fully healthy, he may not be able to take many carries away from=
 Charlie Garner.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - Threesome Updated 11/25/01 Smith=
 had 153 yards of total offense and two touchdowns against New Orleans. Aft=
er a slow start, Smith has become a pretty good weekly option for Fantasy F=
ootballers  Tom Brady , QB NE - Cocked and Locked Updated 11/! 25! /01 Brad=
y put up huge numbers against New Orleans, posting 258 yards passing and fo=
ur touchdowns. He's become a pretty reliable Fantasy player, and his perfor=
mance will likely keep Drew Bledsoe on the Patriots' bench for another week=
.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Threesome Updated 11/25/01 Gannon threw for 221 y=
ards, three TDs and no interceptions against the Giants. He ignored rain-so=
aked conditions, and continued to look like the most reliable QB in Fantasy=
 Football.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Sanders le=
ft Sunday's game against San Diego after re-aggravating a hamstring injury.=
 He was replaced by MarTay Jenkins, and did not return to the game.  Eric M=
oulds , WR BUF - Hollowman Updated 11/25/01 Moulds finally emerged from an =
extended slump, catching six passes for 196 yards and two TDs against Miami=
. He also lost a fumble, and Fantasy owners should still remember that Moul=
ds has been a disappointment for most of the year. Don't be surprised if he=
 follows his best outing of the year with a mediocre performance.  Alex Van=
 Pelt , QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Van Pelt had another fine game=
, throwing for 309 yards, three TDs and one interception. He is definitely =
merits strong Fantasy consideration as long as he remains in Buffalo's star=
ting lineup.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - The Great Bald Hunter Updated 11/25=
/01 Gadsden caught eight passes for 118 yards at Buffalo. He did not catch =
a TD pass, though, and lost a fumble. Gadsden is too unreliable to start fo=
r most Fantasy teams in these important final weeks.  Jay Fiedler , QB MIA =
- The Great Bald Hunter Updated 11/25/01 Fiedler threw for 262 yards, three=
 TDs and no interceptions at Buffalo. His performance may have quieted talk=
 of a QB controversy, but Fiedler is still too inconsistent to be a dependa=
ble Fantasy QB.  Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - AARP Updated 11/25/01 The Redski=
ns held McNabb to 92 passing yards and 39 rushing yards, with no TDs or int=
erceptions. Expect the Philadelphia QB to rebound quickly from such a quiet=
 performance.  James Thrash , WR PHI - Hollowman Updated 11/25/01 Thrash ca=
ught four passes for 32 yards against Washington. He is too incon! si! sten=
t to be a starter on better Fantasy teams as the playoffs approach.   Rod G=
ardner , WR WAS - The Internet Potatoes Updated 11/25/01 Gardner caught fou=
r passes for only 33 yards on Sunday. The rookie has slowed down considerab=
ly in the past few weeks, and now seems like a risk during the Fantasy home=
stretch.   Ki-Jana Carter , RB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Carter saw=
 extensive action on Sunday as Stephen Davis played through back problems. =
He carried 18 times for 56 yards, and is a good backup to have if Davis in =
on your Fantasy team. Davis has always been known to battle minor injuries.=
  Isaac Byrd , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Byrd started in place o=
f the injured Muhsin Muhammad on Sunday. He posted decent Fantasy numbers i=
n Muhammad's absence, catching five passes for 69 yards in Carolina's 10-7 =
loss to Atlanta.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Threesome Updated 11/25/01 Mu=
hammad missed Su! nd! ay's game against Atlanta due to a shoulder injury. H=
is status for next weekend's game against New Orleans is unknown at this ti=
me.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - Cocked and Locked Updated 11/25/01 Alexan=
der caught two passes for 56 yards in his return from a rib injury. He was =
not open often, and Alexander may continue to be a Fantasy disappointment i=
f he stays healthy.  Chris Chandler , QB ATL - The Great Bald Hunter Update=
d 11/25/01 Chandler had a subpar game on Sunday, throwing for only 132 yard=
s against Carolina. The Falcons chose to attack Carolina with their ground =
game, which was the reason for Chandler's poor Fantasy numbers.   Derrick A=
