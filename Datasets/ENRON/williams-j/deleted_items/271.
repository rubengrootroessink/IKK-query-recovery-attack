ESSEX TRADITION CONTINUES WITH LONGWOOD AND CCGROWTH

Boston-based Essex Investment Management, an investment management firm with
a long, rich tradition of managing the fortunes of some of the world's most
powerful leaders, has led to the creation of several equally successful new
ventures. With an investment philosophy built on the foundation that a
company's management team, business model, earnings growth and profitability
will drive its price performance, the firm offers a range of products
including more traditional balanced, growth, and small-, mid-, large-cap
growth as well as its own alternative investment product, a U.S. Hedge
Long/Short fund.

The firm's hedge investment strategy combines bottom-up fundamental research
with secular trend evaluation to invest in companies across all market-caps.
The long investment approach combines both a growth and opportunistic
investment style looking for companies with accelerating fundamentals,
sustainable earnings growth, product or service dominance and consensus
earnings below the firm's projections. The firm's short strategy focuses on
a universe of companies that are in the beginning stages of technical
weakness, downward earnings revisions, peak profit margins and increased
competition.

ROBERT A. DAVIDSON and DON DOUGHERTY, two former Essex portfolio managers
have continued the Essex tradition in managing their own hedge funds,
Longwood Investment Advisors and CCGrowth Management, L.L.C.

LONGWOOD INVESTMENT ADVISORS

Founded in 1994, Boston-based hedge fund Longwood Investment Advisors was
formed by former Essex Investment Management portfolio manager Robert A.
Davidson.  The firm is responsible for Longwood Partners, Longwood Offshore
and Zurich Master Hedge Fund.

Longwood Investment Advisors' long strategy invests in a select number of
attractive, high quality growth-oriented companies.  Longwood looks to
identify companies that are in the early stages of dynamic change, which the
firm believes will translate into accelerating earnings growth.  Emphasis is
placed on purchasing companies where the price of a company's stock is
attractive relative to its intrinsic value.  For Longwood's short
portfolios, the firm looks to short companies with long-term business
valuations that will be negatively affected by poor management, increased
competition or declining industry fundamentals.

For the quarter ended March 31, 2001, the firm reported $256.5 million in
equity assets invested in a portfolio of 213 companies.  While the firm's
equity assets under management increased slightly from the fourth quarter of
2000 to the first quarter of 2001, the number of companies in the firm's
portfolio increased dramatically.  For the quarter ended December 31, 2001,
the firm reported $172.1 million in equity assets under management invested
in a portfolio of 43 companies.

The most heavily weighted sectors for the quarter included technology
(42.6%), energy (19.8%), financials (10.9%), capital goods (8.9%), and
consumer cyclicals (4.9%).  From the fourth quarter of 2000 through the
first quarter of 2001, the firm greatly increased it holdings in the
technology sector, while decreasing its holdings in the energy, capital
goods, and financial sector.  In the fourth quarter of 2000, the most
heavily weighted sectors included financials (25.6%), energy (21.7%),
capital goods (16.5%), technology (13.5%), and consumer cyclicals (6.6%).

Largest purchases for the quarter included Efunds Corp. [EFDS] with 789,450
valued at $15.2 million; Edwards Lifesciences Corp. [EW] with 462,550 shares
valued at $9.1 million; THQ Inc. [THQI] with 201,950 shares valued at $7.7
million; Informix Corp. [IFMX] with 1,385,000 shares valued at $7.5 million;
and, Celgene Corp. [CELG] with 261,450 shares valued at $6.5 million.

Top holdings for the quarter ended March 31, 2001 included Tetra
Technologies Inc. [TTI] with 861,150 shares valued at $17.4 million; Efunds
Corp. [EFDS] with 789,450 shares valued at $15.2 million; Cinar Corp. [CINR]
with 1,300,900 shares valued at $10.1 million; Universal Compression
Holdings [UCO] with 284,250 shares valued at $9.9 million; and, Forest Oil
Corp. [FST] with 320,279 shares valued at $9.6 million.

CCGROWTH MANAGEMENT, L.L.C.

Founded in 1999 by Don Dougherty, a former partner and portfolio manager
with Essex Investment Management, CCGrowth Management, L.L.C. manages the
long/short growth equity Compound Capital Growth Partners, L.P. and Compound
Capital Growth Partners II, L.P. hedge funds.

Using a fundamental, bottom-up approach, combined with technical analysis to
focus primarily on domestic large-cap growth and emerging growth companies,
the firm seeks to invest in companies with a proprietary market position;
improving company or industry outlook; above-average growth; high ROIC;
pricing power; predictable and sustainable earnings; and, low vulnerability
to external events.  On the short side, CCGrowth targets companies with
deteriorating market position; loss of pricing power; new competition; weak
management; vulnerability to external shocks, events or regulatory changes;
weak balance sheet; high valuation; decelerating growth; and, deteriorating
company or industry characteristics.

For the quarter ended March 31, 2001, the firm reported $192.6 million in
equity assets under management invested in a portfolio of 55 companies.
This was an increase from the fourth quarter of 2000 in which the firm
reported $65.7 million in equity assets invested in a portfolio of 50
companies.

Top five holdings, which were all new buys for the first quarter of 2001,
included: Standard Poor's Depository Receipts Trust [SPY] with 500,000
shares valued at $58.3 million; Nasdaq 100 Trust [QQQ] with 400,000 shares
valued at $15.7 million; Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. [CHKP] with
290,000 shares valued at $13.8 million; Elan Plc- ADR [ELN] with 256,100
shares valued at $13.4 million; and, Loews Corp. [LTR] with 200,000 shares
valued at $11.9 million.

-----------------------------------------------------------

SIRIOS BOOSTS ITS LARGE-CAP HOLDINGS

For the first quarter ended March 31, 2001, hedge fund Sirios Capital
Management, L.P. reported ownership of 98 companies valued at $1.4 billion,
an increase from the previous quarter when the firm reported ownership of 88
companies valued at $1.1 billion.  It was another of the many increases in
equity assets that the firm has reported quarter after quarter.

Former MFS Investment Management members CHRISTIAN FELIPE and JOHN BRENNAN
founded the firm in mid 1999.  The firm has also had some turnover recently,
losing analyst VLADIMIR VELKOV to Tudor Investment Management; the firm has
gained the talents of portfolio manager THOMAS BARRETT, who hails from
Felipe and Brennan's former firm, MFS Investment Management.

In the firm's first filing in December 1999, the firm's large-cap holdings
accounted for approximately 50% of the portfolio.  By June 2000, that figure
had climbed to 65%.  In Sirios Capital's most recent filing, almost 80% of
the Boston-based firm's holdings were in large-caps.

The firm decreased its holdings in the capital goods sector only slightly,
while increasing its ownership in health care, technology, and consumer
cyclicals.  While technology had comprised a large proportion of the firm's
invested assets, in it's most recent filing, technology comprised just 14.0%
of the portfolio.  As recently as September 30, 2000, technology was the top
holding with 29.5% of the portfolio.  The firm's overall assets have
continued to grow, despite a slowing economy and difficult market.  Sirios,
however, is also a nimble player, shifting its investments when necessary;
for the most recent quarter the firm had a portfolio turnover of 195.4%.

Top five holdings for the quarter included: Schering-Plough Corp. [SGP] with
3,710,000 shares (valued at $135.5 million); Voicestream Wireless Corp.
[VSTR] with 1,210,363 shares (valued at $111.8 million); Freddie Mac [FRE]
with 1,416,743 shares (valued at $91.8 million); Tyco International Ltd.
[TYC] with 1,900,000 shares (valued at $82.1 million); and, Bristol Myers
Squibb Co. [BMY] with 755,458 shares (valued at $44.9 million).

Top five new purchases included: JC Penney Co. Inc. [JCP] with 2,100,000
shares (valued at $33.6 million); Gtech Holdings Corp. [GTK] with 786,900
shares (valued at $21.4 million); WellPoint Health Networks Inc. [WLP] with
218,500 shares (valued at $20.8 million); C R Bard Inc. [BCR] with 450,000
shares (valued at $20.4 million); and, Duke Energy Co. [DUK] with 400,000
shares (valued at $17.1 million).

-------------------------------------------------------

INTREPID AND 033 TAKE CONSERVATIVE STANCE

Among the milieu of hedge funds filing for the first quarter, numerous funds
have seen their asset bases drops and have, in many cases, altered their
investments to leave them less vulnerable to technology.  This change in
approach has led them to more moderate investments.  The 13F filings of
Intrepid Capital and 033 Asset Management illustrate a further trend: the
migration of some hedge funds towards more temperate investment instruments.


Intrepid Capital Advisors LLC

For the first quarter ended March 31, 2001, Intrepid Capital Advisors LLC
reported ownership of 52 companies valued at $437.0 million, an increase
from the previous quarter when the firm reported ownership of 65 companies
valued at $263.7 million.

STEVEN SHAPIRO, formerly of Soros Fund Management, and MICHAEL AU, formerly
of Maverick Capital, founded Intrepid Capital in July 1998.  The firm was
originally founded to specialize in the technology sector.  In it's most
recent filing, however, it has seemingly moved away from the sector.
Technology comprised 51.4% of the portfolio, closely followed by financials
with 40.3%.  (However, the firm's financial holdings are not entirely
accurate, since the firm owns ETF's such as the Nasdaq 100 Trust, which are
counted as mutual funds, and thus financials, rather than the underlying
securities they represent.)  By contrast, in the fourth quarter of 2000, the
firm's top sector weightings included technology with 82.5%, financials with
4.4%, and communication services with 3.4%.

Top five holdings included: Nasdaq 100 Trust [QQQ] with 2,700,000 shares
(valued at $105.7 million); Standard Poor's Depository Receipts Trust [SPY]
with 600,000 shares (valued at $70.0 million); Microsoft Corp. [MSFT] with
550,000 shares (valued at $30.1 million); IBM [IBM] with 309,600 shares
(valued at $29.8 million); and, Qwest Communications International Inc. [Q]
with 600,000 shares (valued at $21.0 million).

Intrepid's new purchases included stakes in Standard Poor's Depository
Receipts, IBM, and Qwest.  Rounding out the top five were new stakes in
Verizon Communications [VZ] with 200,000 shares (valued at $9.9 million),
and Apple Computer Inc. [AAPL] with 300,000 shares (valued at $6.6.
million).

033 Asset Management, L.L.C.

For the first quarter ended March 31, 2001, San Francisco-based hedge fund
033 Asset Management, L.L.C. reported ownership of 18 companies valued at
$73.8 million, a decrease from the previous quarter when the firm reported
ownership of 28 companies valued at $126.3 million.  The firm, founded by
former members of the Robertson Stevenson Private Client Group, has managed
to increase its equity assets under management in a market where many other
players have unwittingly watched their assets dwindle.

The founders, including ROBERT TISHMAN, MATTHEW KLEIN, JOHN SCHNUGG, and
MICHAEL VIGO, manage the 033 Growth Partners I, L.P., 033 Growth Partners
II, L.P., Oyster Pond Partners, L.P. and 033 Growth International Fund, Ltd.
Tishman, who serves as the CIO, operates out of the firm's offices in Boston
with analysts DANNY DIAS, and MARIO FIALHO, while the remaining principals
operate out of the firm's San Francisco offices. The firm emphasizes its
focus on technology and is reportedly very active on road shows and in
meeting with company management.

Despite its technology focus, however, the fund seems to have taken less
risky positions in market tracking instruments.  While such baskets of
stocks can be traded and shorted quickly, it may also identify a trend among
some technology funds.  Quickly running out of solid tech-companies to
invest in, many funds are moving to safer positions before returning to the
fray.

For 033 Capital, the large concentration in such instruments is similar to
the previous quarter.  However, the fund did have some turnover, selling out
its holdings in Standard Poor's Depository Receipts Trust [SPY] and Midcap
Spdr Trust Communications Corp. [MDY].  The firm also has an extremely high
turnover; eight of the firm's top ten purchases were new to the firm's
portfolio.  The firm's portfolio turnover rate thus far is 301.7%.

Top ten holdings for the quarter included: iShares Trust (Rusl 2000 Grow)
[IWO] with 563,000 shares (valued at $30.9 million); Sector SPDR Trust (Sbi
Int-Tech) [XLK] with 240,000 shares (valued at $6.0 million); Cendant Corp.
[CD] with 400,000 shares (valued at $5.8 million); Kinder Morgan Inc. [KMI]
with 75,000 shares (valued at $4.0 million); Calpine Corp. with 60,000
shares (valued at $3.3 million); Agile Software Corp. [AGIL] with 275,000
shares (valued at $3.0 million); Entergy Corp. [ETR] with 75,000 shares
(valued at $2.8 million); MCK Communications Inc. [MCKC] with 1,238,000
shares (valued at $2.7 million); Dynegy Inc. New [DYN] with 50,000 shares
(valued at $2.6 million); and, Fibernet Telecom Group Inc. [FTGX] with
923,260 shares (valued at $2.5 million).

SECTOR COVERAGE: STATE STREET RESEARCH & MANAGEMENT

Boston-based State Street Research & Management, with $18.5 billion in
equity assets as of March 31, 2001, recently lost one its top portfolio
managers to the world of hedge funds.  RUDOLPH KLUIBER, formerly a portfolio
manager specializing in small-cap value stocks with State Street Research &
Management Co., left the firm to launch a hedge fund with GREGORY FRASER and
TIMOTHY KROCHUK, who recently left Fidelity. At State Street, Kluiber
managed the State Street Research Aurora Fund (with $989.4 million in equity
assets as of September 30, 2000) and Advantus Venture Fund.  Except for the
