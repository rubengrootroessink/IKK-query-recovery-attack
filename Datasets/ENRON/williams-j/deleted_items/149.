*Following the recent break-up of Pequot Capital Management and technology
guru Dan Benton, San Mateo, CA-based hedge fund Bowman Capital is rumored to
be following suit. In an article in Barron's on Saturday May 12, 2001, it
was announced the Bowman's two principals, Larry Bowman and John Hurley,
might be going their separate ways.

The firm manages the Spinnaker Technology Fund, L.P., the Spinnaker Offshore
Fund, LTD, the Spinnaker Crossover Fund, the Spinnaker Founders Fund, and
Offshore Founders Fund, LTD. As of December 31, 2001, Bowman managed
approximately $4.2 billion in equity assets according to a 13F filed with
the SEC. This was a significant decrease from the quarter before when the
firm reported $9.8 billion in equity assets invested in approximately 170
companies.  For the first quarter ended March 31, 2001, Bowman Capital
reported ownership of 116 companies, valued at $3.0 billion.

*Effective June 1, 2001, MFS Investment Management and Jennison Associates

Company Stock Fund; the American Odyssey Emerging Opportunities Fund is now
the CitiStreet Small Company Stock Fund; and, the American Odyssey
International Equity Fund is now the CitiStreet International Stock Fund.

*Sources at Fidelity Management & Research have stated that there may have
been a bug in the firm's reporting system that affected some filings. This
may have caused some ownership declines to be overstated. For example, the
reported position of AOL Time Warner was 100 shares when in fact the actual
position was 113,814,663 shares. Fidelity restated its holdings in an
amended 13F filing on May 16, 2001.

-----------------------------------------------------------

13F: IRRECONCILABLE DIFFERECES: BOWMAN AND PEQUOT FACE BREAKUPS

Following the collapse of Long Term Capital Management, a number of the
remaining billion-dollar hedge funds have continued to be troubled by poor
investment returns and management shake-ups.  With Julian Robertson and
George Soros out of the picture, some of the smaller funds have continued to
drop out of the running or morph their institutions.  The recent months and
days of 2001 have seen the breakup of Pequot Capital Management's ARTHUR
SAMBERG and DANIEL BENTON and the reported breakup of Bowman Capital's LARRY
BOWMAN and JOHN HURLEY.

For the first quarter ended March 31, 2001, Bowman Capital reported
ownership of 116 companies, valued at $3.0 billion, a sharp decline from the
previous quarter, when the firm reported ownership of 132 companies, valued
at $4.2 billion.  One year ago, for the first quarter of 2000, Bowman
reported ownership of 224 companies valued at $12.0 billion.

Bowman first made a name for itself riding the cusp of the technology boom.
The firm aggressively invested in technology while hedging its bets.  One
year ago, the firm's average portfolio P/E was neatly double the average P/E
of the S&P 500.  It has since fallen dramatically, to only slightly above
the S&P.

In an article in Barron's on Saturday May 12, 2001, it was reported that
Bowman's two principals, Larry Bowman and John Hurley, would be going their
separate ways.  The firm has not responded.  The breakup, it is widely
believed, is a result of lagging performance in a difficult market.  While
the firm shorts and hedges against potential downturns, the firm's
technology focus may have left it few places to hide.  Bowman has also made
notable efforts in recent years to expand its involvement in private equity
and mezzanine financing.  It even opened a new office in London to focus on
European venture capital.

During the dot.com boom, venture capital was an excellent way to get
involved in high-tech companies on the ground floor.  As the IPO market has
shriveled up and technology stocks have fallen out of favor, Bowman has been
left holding long positions in companies that benefited from an opening IPO
pop, but that suffered following the downturn.  One such example was
fiber-optic communications equipment maker Oni Systems Corp. [ONIS].  Bowman
was on the ground floor of the company, supplying it with private financing.
Shortly after the firm's 2000 IPO, the stock reached an all time high of
142.0.  On May 17, 2001, the company closed at 33.15.

Bowman's top five new purchases for the quarter included: Lexmark
International Inc. [LXK] with 1,000,000 shares (valued at $45.5. million);
Compaq Computer Corp. [CPQ] with 2,220,000 shares (valued at $40.4 million);
Mercury Interactive Corp. [MERQ] with 800,000 shares (valued at $33.5
million); Rambus Inc. Del [RMBS] with 1,600,000 shares (valued at $33.0
million); and, Apple Computer with 1,379,600 shares (valued at $30.4
million).

Bowman's top five holdings for the first quarter included: Microsoft Corp.
[MSFT] with 6,258,100 shares (valued at $342.2 million); EMC Corp MA [EMC]
with 5,372,000 shares (valued at $157.9 million); Qualcomm Inc. [QCOM] with
2,746,240 shares (valued at $155.5 million); Oracle Corp. [ORCL] with
8,568,500 shares (valued at $128.4 million); and, Sonus Networks Inc. [SONS]
with 6,400,000 shares (valued at $127.7 million).

Arthur Samberg and Daniel Benton, the managers and founding partners of
hedge fund giant Pequot Capital Management, are also ending their
partnership, it was reported last month.  Benton is reportedly leaving to
run his own hedge fund, Andor Capital Management. Samberg will remain at
Pequot and continue to manage the Westport, CT-based firm.

The split, it has been reported, was not a result of poor performance, or
souring market conditions; such conditions were responsible for the downfall
of Soros Fund Management and Julian Robertson's Tiger Management. The split
is reportedly a result of differing opinions and visions of Pequot's future.
Benton, a technology specialist, wanted to continue to make large bets, long
or short, on technology, while Samberg was interested in further
diversification. The fund has also struggled under a growing asset base. In
a letter to shareholders following the fourth quarter, the firm reported in
excess of $15 billion in net assets under management. However, in its 13F,
filed for the quarter ended December 31, 2000, the firm reported ownership
of 493 companies, valued at $7.6 billion, a sharp decrease from the first
quarter of 2000, when the firm reported ownership of 517 companies valued at
$16.5 billion.  For the first quarter ended March 31, 2001, the firm's
reported equity asset declined again, to a reported ownership of 563
companies, valued at $6.4 billion.

Pequot's top five new purchases included: Qwest Communications International
Inc. [Q] with 5,608,900 shares (valued at $196.6 million); Electronic Arts
[ERTS] with 3,617,100 shares (valued at $196.2 million); Philip Morris Cos
Inc. [MO] with 2,300,000 shares (valued at $109.1 million); NTT DoCoMo Inc.
with 6,065 shares (valued at $105.5 million); and, Invitrogen Corp. [IVGN]
with 1,779,000 shares (valued at $97.6 million).

Pequot's top five holdings included: Qwest Communications International Inc.
[Q] with 5,608,900 shares (valued at $196.6 million); Electronic Arts [ERTS]
with 3,617,100 shares (valued at $196.2 million); Pfizer Inc. [PFE] with
4,722,853 shares (valued at $193.4 million); Curagen Inc. [CRGN] with
6,450,500 shares (valued at $151.2 million); and, Incyte Genomics Inc.
[INCY] with 9,343,700 shares (valued at $143.4 million).

13F: ORIGIN CAPITAL MAINTAINS DEVOTION TO HEALTH CARE

Founded in 2000, San Francisco-based hedge fund Origin Capital Management
hit the ground running in its first year in operation.  Launched at a time
when the markets were on very shaky ground, the firm reported $620.9 million
in equity assets for its first 13F filing for the quarter ended December 31,
2000.  Walter "Buzz" Burlock, a former Soros Fund Management managing
director, spearheaded this new venture to invest in both public and pre-IPO
companies predominately in the health care sector.

For the quarter ended March 31, 2001, the firm reported $428.3 million in
equity assets invested in a portfolio of 96 companies, a decrease of
approximately $200.0 million dollars from the prior quarter.

Not surprisingly, health care and biotechnology were the most heavily
weighted sectors in Origin's portfolio.  Approximately, 52.4% of the
portfolio was invested in biotech companies, followed by health care, which
comprised 23.7% of the portfolio.  Consumer staples was the next most
heavily weighted sector, with 10.2% of the portfolio, giving it a slight
edge over drugs/pharmaceuticals, which comprised 7.3% of the portfolio.

Although the majority of the portfolio (50.2%) fell in the large-cap arena,
there was a fairly large representation of mid- and small-cap companies,
with 21.2% and 28.6%, respectively.

New positions for the quarter included a 200,000 share position in Elan
Plc-ADR [ELN]; a 200,000 share position in Alza Corp. [AZA] valued at $8.1
million; 150,000 shares of AstraZeneca Plc-ADR [AZN] valued at $7.2 million;
100,000 shares of Bristol Myers Squibb Co.  [BMY] valued at $5.9 million;
and, 80,800 shares of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.- ADR [TEVA] with
80,800 shares valued at $4.4 million.

Top five holdings for the quarter ended March 31, 2001, included: McKesson
HBOC Inc. [MCK] with 1,218,600 shares valued at $32.6 million; Boston
Scientific Corp. [BSX] with 1,607,000 shares valued at $32.4 million; Biogen
Inc. [BGEN] with 510,000 shares valued at $32.3 million; Genentech Inc.
[DNA] with 536,200 with $27.1 million; and, Quintiles Transnational Corp.
[QTRN] with 807,450 shares valued at $15.2 million.

-----------------------------------------------------------

13F: GALLEON FAVORS BIOTECH, COMPUTERS

For the first quarter ended March 31, 2001, Galleon Management L.P. reported
ownership of 131 companies valued at $1.2 billion, a decline from the
previous quarter when the firm reported ownership of 105 companies valued at
$1.7 billion.  It most recent filing is a notable decline from less than a
year ago, when the firm reported ownership of 147 companies valued at over
$2.7 billion.

The high profile fund run by hedge fund guru Raj Rajaratnam is just one of
several hedge funds that have seen their assets under management decrease
amid a slumping technology market.  Recent weeks and months have seen high
profile splits in hedge funds such as Pequot Management Inc. and Bowman
Capital Management, L.L.C.

Top five micro sector weightings for the firm included biotechnology with
12.8%, computer hardware (10.9%), computer software (10.9%), health care
(drugs/pharmaceuticals) (10.1%), and computers (networking) (9.0%).

Some of the firm's expanded interest in the biotech and health care sectors
may be a result of the recent addition of SAMUEL NAVARRO.  Navarro, formerly
a managing director and sell-side global head of Health Care Corporate
Finance at ING Barings, recently joined the firm as an analyst and managing
director of the Galleon Group Health Care Fund.  Navarro's addition follows
the departure of PREM LACHMAN, formerly a partner and portfolio manager
providing coverage of the pharmaceuticals, contract services and
distribution sector.  Lachman launched his own venture, Maximus Capital,
with the help of former Moore Capital Management professional Joanne Soja
and former Morgan Stanley Dean Witter portfolio manager Teresa McRoberts.

Many of Galleon's other offerings tend to weigh more heavily in tech,
including the Galleon Omni Fund (formerly known as Needham Omni Fund), the
Calypso Advisors LLC and Needham Emerging Growth Partners, LP.

Top five holdings for the quarter ended March 31, 2001 included: Corvis
Corp. [CORV] with 11,050,000 shares (valued at $77.7 million); Nasdaq 100
Trust [QQQ] with 1,850,000 shares (valued at $72.4 million); Microsoft Corp.
[MSFT] with 1,050,000 shares (valued at $57.4 million); Compaq Computer
Corp. [CPQ] with 2,000,500 shares (valued at $36.4 million); and, Gateway
Inc. [GTW] with 2,094,800 shares (valued at $35.2 million).

Top five new purchases included the firm's largest holdings: switching and
routing equipment maker Corvis Corp. as well as Compaq and Gateway.
Rounding out the top five are Texas Instruments Inc. [TXN] with 1,000,000
shares (valued at $31.0 million) and Exodus Communications Inc. [EXDS] with
2,050,000 shares (valued at $22.0 million).
