 Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Rod Smith , WR DEN - Matty Updated=
 11/19/01 Smith (ankle) could not finish Sunday's game. His status for Thur=
sday's game against Dallas is unclear.  Terance Mathis , WR ATL - Frank Upd=
ated 11/19/01 Mathis has by far his best game of the season, catching seven=
 passes for 70 yards against Green Bay. He suffered a mild concussion in th=
e game, but he's expected to be fine for this weekend's contest at Carolina=
.   Jackie Harris , TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Harris suffered a =
strained right hamstring during Sunday's game against Philadelphia. He did =
not return to the contest, and is listed as day to day.   Frank Sanders , W=
R ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Sanders had a huge game against Detroit=
 on Sunday, catching seven passes for 127 yards and a touchdown. He injured=
 his hamstring in the game, however, and is listed as day to day.   Quincy =
Carter  , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Carter feels as though his h=
amstring has healed enough that he's ready to return to action. However, th=
e Cowboys will start Ryan Leaf for a few more weeks before Carter gets his =
starting job back. The team wants to evaluate Leaf in a few games this seas=
on to determine if he'll have any trade value in the offseason.   James Jac=
kson , RB CLE - Hunter Updated 11/19/01 Jackson told the Cleveland Plain-De=
aler it was a coach's decision not to use him against the Ravens. Jackson h=
ad been suffering from an ankle injury, but reports prior to gametime had i=
ndicated he might have been able to play. With the sudden emergence of Benj=
amin Gay, Jackson's Fantas! y ! value might drop greatly.  Ryan Leaf , QB D=
AL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Leaf had another terrible outing this week=
end, but the Dallas Morning News is reporting that he'll remain the team's =
starting quarterback for the time being. However, he's no better than waive=
r wire fodder in Fantasy Football.   Kevin Lockett , WR WAS - Free Agent Up=
dated 11/19/01 Lockett left Sunday's game against Denver in the first quart=
er due to a rib injury. His status for next week's game against Philadelphi=
a is uncertain at this time. Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/19=
/01 Banks, who suffered a concussion during Sunday's game against Denver, t=
old the Washington Post that there's a "definite possibility" he would be r=
eady in time for next weekend's game against Philadelphia. Kent Graham woul=
d start if Banks is unable to play, but neither QB is an attractive Fantasy=
 option against the Eagles.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/=
19/01 Smith left Sunday's game against Philadelphia with a sprained knee. H=
owever, he is expected to be in the starting lineup when Dallas ! fa! ces D=
enver on Thanksgiving Day.   Larry Foster , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/=
19/01 Foster suffered an apparent leg injury during Sunday's game against A=
rizona. He is listed as day to day.  Desmond Howard , WR DET - Free Agent U=
pdated 11/19/01 Howard suffered a shoulder injury during Sunday's win over =
Arizona. He did not return to the game, and is listed as day to day.   Bert=
 Emanuel  , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Emanuel suffered a knee in=
jury during Sunday's game against Arizona. He is listed as day to day.   Mu=
hsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/18/01 Muhammad sprained his left=
 shoulder in Sunday's game against the 49ers. His status for the Week 11 ga=
me against Atlanta is unclear.  Mike Anderson , RB DEN - Neal/McKay Updated=
 11/18/01 Anderson rushed for only 31 yards on 13 carries against the Redsk=
ins. Olandis Gary carried the ball 10 t! im! es for 28 yards. It is apparen=
t Anderson is no longer worthy of a starting spot on Fantasy teams, and Gar=
y will continue to see some work at his expense.  Michael Westbrook , WR WA=
S - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Westbrook caught nine passes for 104 yards =
and a TD at Denver. Opposing defenses are focusing on rookie Rod Gardner, a=
nd Westbrook is getting open often after starting the year slowly.  Jake Pl=
ummer , QB ARI - Frank Updated 11/18/01 Plummer threw for 334 yards, four T=
Ds and was intercepted once by Detroit. Such stellar performances are rare =
for Plummer, who may not have a better game this season.  Michael Pittman ,=
 RB ARI - Matty Updated 11/18/01 The awful Detroit defense limited Pittman =
to 81 rushing yards on 23 carries. Don't start Pittman in any upcoming week=
s unless your team is very thin at RB..  David Sloan , TE DET - Free Agent =
Updated 11/18/01 Sloan caught two TD passes for a total of three yards at A=
rizona. If you are desperate for help at TE, consider Sloan, ! wh! o always=
 gets regular looks from Charlie Batch.  Lamont Warren , RB DET - Free Agen=
t Updated 11/18/01 Warren rushed for 32 yards and a TD at Arizona and caugh=
t 11 passes for 64 yards and a score. The Lions will continue to feature Wa=
rren on third downs and near the goal line as a receiver, making him a good=
 Fantasy backup for the rest of the year.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Martin Up=
dated 11/18/01 Dunn caught 12 passes for 138 yards against the Bears, but h=
e rushed for only 12 yards and fumbled twice. Don't count on Dunn for consi=
stently good Fantasy numbers during the next few weeks. He can be explosive=
, but he is also erratic.  Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Giggles Updated 11/18=
/01 Johnson caught 12 passes for 89 yards against the Bears, but he failed =
to get in the end zone again. Don't depend on Johnson down the stretch unle=
ss your team is very thin at wideout.  David Terrell , WR CHI - Free Agent =
Updated 11/18/01 Terrell caught one! p! ass for 15 yards at Tampa Bay. The =
rookie wideout is not consistent enough to start for most Fantasy teams.  M=
arty Booker , WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Booker caught seven pass=
es for 165 yards and three TDs at Tampa Bay. In his third season, Booker ha=
s become a superb Fantasy wideout. He is a player you must start every week=
, no matter what matchup he faces.   Plaxico Burress , WR PIT - Free Agent =
Updated 11/18/01 The Jaguars limited Burress to one catch for 13 yards. The=
 second-year receiver has still not proven he can be a reliable Fantasy pla=
yer.  LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - Hunter Updated 11/18/01 Tomlinson put u=
p decent rushing numbers against Oakland, posting 68 yards and a touchdown.=
 His overall statistics have been down in recent weeks, however, which may =
have something to do with the fact that he held out for the entire preseaso=
n.   Hines Ward , WR PIT - Tori Updated 11/18/01 Ward caught nine passes fo=
r 112 yards and a TD against Jackson! vi! lle. While he doesn't score often=
, Ward has become a very solid receiver for Pittsburgh this year, and he wi=
ll always post respectable totals.  Doug Flutie , QB SD - Russell Updated 1=
1/18/01 Flutie's recent struggles continued against Oakland, throwing for o=
nly 98 yards on Sunday. Unless he faces a good matchup, starting Flutie is =
becoming somewhat of a gamble.   Stacey Mack , RB JAC - Hunter Updated 11/1=
8/01 Mack was held to six rushing yards on eight carries at Pittsburgh. He =
has not been a reliable back for the Jaguars or Fantasy owner! s ! this sea=
