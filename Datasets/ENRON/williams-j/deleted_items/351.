 Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Hatcher=
's Right Nut Updated 11/16/01 Wheatley (knee) is out for Sunday's game with=
 the Chargers. Charlie Garner will once again be Oakland's feature back. Za=
ck Crockett may be used in goal-line situations.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - =
Threesome Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Wycheck is expec=
ted to play half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That makes him a risk=
y start from a Fantasy perspective.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Hatcher's Righ=
t Nut Updated 11/16/01 McNair's status is still in question for Sunday's ga=
me against Cincinnati due to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball duri=
ng individual drills Friday, and according to published reports, is likely =
to play despite not being 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week =
as a result.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Little Bambinos Updated 11/16/01 Smit=
h will return to the lineup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two g=
ames with a sprained right knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after F=
riday's practice that Smith would "be ready to play the majority of the gam=
e." His return bumps Troy Hambrick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend y=
ou use either back against the stingy Eagles rush defense.  Frank Sanders ,=
 WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Sanders (hamstring) was added to the =
NFL injury report on Friday and is now listed as questionable for Sunday's =
game against Detroit.  However, if you're completely desperate for a wideou=
t in a larger league this week, Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detro=
it secondary is worth considering as long as he's able to play.    Chris We=
inke, QB CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, =
Weinke will be the starting quarterback for Sunday's game against San Franc=
isco. However, he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team.   Daunte Culpe=
pper , QB MIN - Threesome Updated 11/16/01 Culpepper is one pace for a good=
 Fantasy season despite the lack of consistency in Minnesota's offense this=
 season. He's one of the better quarterbacks in the league from a Fantasy p=
erspective, and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.   Cris=
 Carter , WR MIN - The Internet Potatoes Updated 11/16/01 Carter's numbers =
may be down somewhat this season, but he's still too good to ever consider =
benching. The veteran has a knack for finding the end zone, and should have=
 a good game against rookie CB Will Allen and the Giants' secondary on Mond=
ay night.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - Road Rage Updated 11/16/01 Moss is listed=
 as probable for Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants due to an ankle inju=
ry. He's been underachieving this season, but it's almost impossible to ben=
ch him based on his potential to post sol! id! Fantasy numbers.   Ricky Wil=
liams , RB NO - Road Rage Updated 11/16/01 Williams is one of the better Fa=
ntasy backs in the league, and is a good player to use on a weekly basis. H=
e'll face an Indianapolis defense that has been underachieving all season l=
ong, so Williams is a must-start.     Aaron Brooks , QB NO - Road Rage Upda=
ted 11/16/01 Brooks had a big game against San Francisco last weekend, thro=
wing for 347 yards and two scores. He may be a bit inconsistent this season=
, but his potential to post huge numbers makes it tough to bench him, espec=
ially against a vulnerable Indianapolis defense.    Willie Jackson , WR NO =
- Cocked and Locked Updated 11/16/01 Jackson put up a huge game against San=
 Francisco last weekend, posting 11 catches and 167 yards receiving. He'll =
face a questionable Indianapolis squad that is vulnerable to the pass in We=
ek 10, so starting Jackson this week is a solid option.   Stephen Davis , R=
B WAS - Hatcher's Right Nut Updated 11/16/01 Davis has stepped up his play =
after beginning the season slowly. He's averaged 112 yards rushing over his=
 last four games, and is once again emerging as a reliable Fantasy player. =
Give him the start in Week 10 against a Denver defense that is vulnerable t=
o high scoring games.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 B=
anks has played well of late, throwing five touchdowns in his last three ga=
mes. He's got a good matchup this weekend against a Denver team that can be=
 beaten through the air, but he's only worth considering in very deep Fanta=
sy leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 West=
brook has been inconsistent this season, but he has caught three touchdown =
passes in his last four games. He'll face a Denver secondary this weekend t=
hat is vulnerable at best, so starting him in deeper leagues is worth consi=
dering.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - The Internet Potatoes Updated 11/16/01 Gar=
dner has been held in check in his last two games, catching only three pass=
es for 38 yards. He does have a favorable matchup this weekend against Denv=
er, however, so starting him is a good move.   Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Li=
ttle Bambinos Updated 11/16/01 Hakim has been inconsistent in recent weeks,=
 so starting him on your Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is rig=
ht. He'll go up against a tough New England secondary in Week Ten, so avoid=
 using him outside of deeper leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - Road Rage Upd=
ated 11/16/01 Holt continues to put up consistent yardage totals, but he's =
only scored only three touchdowns this season. He'll face a tough New Engla=
nd secondary this weekend, but he's still worth starting on your Fantasy te=
am based on his potential to put up solid numbers.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL -=
 Hollowman Updated 11/16/01 Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy totals thi=
s season, but he's still one of the better wideouts in the league. He'll fa=
ce CB Ty Law and the formidable New England secondary, but he's still worth=
 starting based on his potential for big numbers.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL=
 - AARP Updated 11/16/01 Faulk had a huge game against Carolina, proving th=
at he is still the best Fantasy player in the league. He's a must-start eve=
ry week, and should post solid numbers in Week 10 against New England.   Er=
nie Conwell, TE STL - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Conwell has had a few dow=
n weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is somewhat of a gamble. With=
 the lack of depth at tight end around the league, however, starting Conwel=
l is something many Fantasy owners will have no choice but to do.   Richard=
 Huntley , RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Huntley will be the likely =
starter this weekend against San Francisco, but don't be surprised if he sp=
lits carries with Nick Goings. Avoid starting either back in Week 10 if at =
all possible.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Hayes h=
ad only two catches for 11 yards last weekend against St. Louis. He's been =
unreliable for Fantasy owners this season, so starting him is a real gamble=
.    Wesley Walls , TE CAR - The Internet Potatoes Updated 11/16/01 Walls h=
as been held in check over the last three weeks, but he's still one of the =
better tight ends in the league. He's had some success against San Francisc=
o in the past, so starting him is advisable.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - T=
hreesome Updated 11/16/01 Muhammad finally had a somewhat productive game, =
catching six passes for 75 yards against St. Louis. He's had some success i=
n the past against this week's opponent, San Francisco, so starting him is =
a decent move.   Brett Favre , QB GB - Hatcher's Right Nut Updated 11/16/01=
 Favre has been one of the best Fantasy quarterbacks in the league this sea=
son. He'll face an Atlanta team on Sunday with a very vulnerable secondary,=
 so be sure to start Favre this week.   Bubba Franks , TE GB - The Internet=
 Potatoes Updated 11/16/01 Franks may not put up huge yardage numbers, but =
his seven touchdowns in eight games makes him a valuable Fantasy player. Un=
less you have a better option on your roster, Franks is the type of tight e=
nd that should start on a weekly basis.    Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Cocked =
and Locked Updated 11/16/01 Schroeder (ankle) is not listed on the NFL inju=
ry report, and is expected to start on Sunday against Atlanta. He's a solid=
 play this week against Atlanta, whose secondary is vulnerable to strong pa=
ssing teams like Green Bay.   Reuben Droughns , RB DET - Free Agent Updated=
 11/16/01 Droughns will likely split time with Lamont Warren in Detroit's b=
ackfield this weekend in James Stewart's absence. Neither back has much Fan=
tasy value outside of deeper leagues, and starting them is a huge gamble.  =
 Lamont Warren , RB DET - Hatcher's Right Nut Updated 11/16/01 Warren will =
likely start in place of the injured James Stewart on Sunday against Arizon=
a. He's split carries with Reuben Droughns, and is only worth starting as a=
