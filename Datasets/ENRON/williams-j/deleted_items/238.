I hate coaching...

willie always changes the batting order, hatcher always complains about the
outfield, Ferg just makes fun of me

How 'bout I stop off before each game and kick your ass....

Take a handful of candy bars and shove em up your ass, it won't make you any
fatter than what you do already.

I want to hear that you are coaching, or maybe that you aren't coaching but
you are going to start working hard on becoming a better ball player.  What
we need is a good team mom.  Do you think you could stop off before each
game and pick up some snickers and sodies.  Each player gets to pick the
drink and candy each week and then you go get the stuff.
