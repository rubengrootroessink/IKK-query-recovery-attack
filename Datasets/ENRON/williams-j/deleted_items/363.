 Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Threeso=
me Updated 11/18/01 Muhammad sprained his left shoulder in Sunday's game ag=
ainst the 49ers. His status for the Week 11 game against Atlanta is unclear=
.  Mike Anderson , RB DEN - Hatcher's Right Nut Updated 11/18/01 Anderson r=
ushed for only 31 yards on 13 carries against the Redskins. Olandis Gary ca=
rried the ball 10 times for 28 yards. It is apparent Anderson is no longer =
worthy of a starting spot on Fantasy teams, and Gary will continue to see! =
s! ome work at his expense.  Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Free Agent Update=
d 11/18/01 Westbrook caught nine passes for 104 yards and a TD at Denver. O=
pposing defenses are focusing on rookie Rod Gardner, and Westbrook is getti=
ng open often after starting the year slowly.  Jake Plummer , QB ARI - Free=
 Agent Updated 11/18/01 Plummer threw for 334 yards, four TDs and was inter=
cepted once by Detroit. Such stellar performances are rare for Plummer, who=
 may not have a better game this season.  Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Road R=
age Updated 11/18/01 The awful Detroit defense limited Pittman to 81 rushin=
g yards on 23 carries. Don't start Pittman in any upcoming weeks unless you=
r team is very thin at RB..  David Sloan , TE DET - Free Agent Updated 11/1=
8/01 Sloan caught two TD passes for a total of three yards at Arizona. If y=
ou are desperate for help at TE, consider Sloan, who always gets regular lo=
oks from Charlie Batch.  Lamont Warren , RB DET - Hatcher's Right Nut Updat=
ed 11/18/01 Warren rushed for 32 yards and a TD at Arizona and caught 11 pa=
sses for 64 yards and a score. The Lions will continue to feature Warren on=
 third downs and near the goal line as a receiver, making him a good Fantas=
y backup for the rest of the year.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - AARP Updated 11/=
18/01 Dunn caught 12 passes for 138 yards against the Bears, but he rushed =
for only 12 yards and fumbled twice. Don't count on Dunn for consistently g=
ood Fantasy numbers during the next few weeks. He can be explosive, but he =
is also erratic.  Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Hatcher's Right Nut Updated 11=
/18/01 Johnson caught 12 passes for 89 yards against the Bears, but he fail=
ed to get in the end zone again. Don't depend on Johnson down the stretch u=
nless your team is very thin at wideout.  David Terrell , WR CHI - Free Age=
nt Updated 11/18/01 Terrell caught one pass for 15 yards at Tampa Bay. The =
rookie wideout is not consistent enough to start for most Fantasy teams.  M=
arty Booker , WR CHI - Threesome Updated 11/18/01 Booker caught seven passe=
s for 165 yards and three TDs at Tampa Bay. In his third season, Booker has=
 become a superb Fantasy wideout. He is a player you must start every week,=
 no matter what matchup he faces.   Plaxico Burress , WR PIT - AARP Updated=
 11/18/01 The Jaguars limited Burress to one catch for 13 yards. The second=
-year receiver has still not proven he can be a reliable Fantasy player.  L=
aDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - The Internet Potatoes Updated 11/18/01 Tomlins=
on put up decent rushing numbers against Oakland, posting 68 yards and a to=
uchdown. His overall statistics have been down in recent weeks, however, wh=
ich may have something to do with the fact that he held out for the entire =
preseason.   Hines Ward , WR PIT - The Internet Potatoes Updated 11/18/01 W=
ard caught nine passes for 112 yards and a TD against Jacksonville. While h=
e doesn't score often, Ward has become a very solid receiver for Pittsburgh=
 this year, and he will always post respectable totals.  Doug Flutie , QB S=
D - The Internet Potatoes U! pd! ated 11/18/01 Flutie's recent struggles co=
ntinued against Oakland, throwing for only 98 yards on Sunday. Unless he fa=
ces a good matchup, starting Flutie is becoming somewhat of a gamble.   Sta=
cey Mack , RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Mack was held to six rushin=
g yards on eight carries at Pittsburgh. He has not been a reliable back for=
 the Jaguars or Fantasy owners this season.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Threeso=
me Updated 11/18/01 Gannon had a solid outing against San Diego, throwing f=
or 311 yards and four touchdowns. He's one of the top five Fantasy quarterb=
acks in the league and is a must-start every week.   Jerry Rice , WR OAK - =
The Flounders Updated 11/18/01 Rice had a huge game on Sunday, catching eig=
ht passes for 131 yards and three touchdowns against San Diego. Rice may no=
t be an every-week starter in smaller leagues, but he can certainly still p=
ut up huge Fantasy numbers when the matchup is right.   Jon Kitna , QB CIN =
- Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Kitna put up 234! y! ards passing and a touch=
down against Tennessee, but two interceptions made his performance mediocre=
. He's no better than a reserve Fantasy player at this point, best used whe=
n the matchup is right in a deeper league.   Koren Robinson , WR SEA - Hatc=
her's Right Nut Updated 11/18/01 Robinson caught two passes for 15 yards at=
 Buffalo, including his first career TD, a seven-yarder. Robinson is slowly=
 improving, but still does not produce enough to be a reliable Fantasy play=
er.  Corey Dillon , RB CIN - The Flounders Updated 11/18/01 Dillon was held=
 in check by Tennessee, rushing for only 38 yards on Sunday. However, with =
all the injured running backs around the league this season, Dillon is stil=
l a must-start on a weekly basis.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Hatcher's Right=
 Nut Updated 11/18/01 McNair played despite a sore thumb, throwing for 172 =
yards and a touchdown against Cincinnati. He's been an unreliable Fantasy p=
layer this season, and is worth starting only when the matchup is right.   =
Eddie George , RB TEN - Hollowman Updated 11/18/01 George was unimpressive =
once again,! p! osting only 65 scrimmage yards on Sunday against Cincinnati=
. He just doesn't seem to be at full speed this season, and has been a huge=
 Fantasy disappointment.   Ricky Williams , RB NO - Road Rage Updated 11/18=
/01 Williams had a big game on Sunday, rushing for 120 yards and a touchdow=
n against Indianapolis. He continues to prove his value as a Fantasy player=
, and is a must-start ever week.   Aaron Brooks , QB NO - Road Rage Updated=
 11/18/01 Brooks had an outstanding game against Indianapolis, throwing for=
 249 yards and two touchdowns. He's put together two straight solid games, =
and may finally be reaching the potential the coaching staff knew he was ca=
pable of.   Peyton Manning , QB IND - Little Bambinos Updated 11/18/01 Mann=
ing put up a decent performance against New Orleans, posting 262 yards and =
a touchdown. He may not be putting up Manning-like numbers this season, but=
 he's still far too valuable to ever consider benching.   Marcus Pollard , =
TE IND - AARP Updated 11/18/01 Poll! ar! d had a huge game on Sunday, catch=
ing three passes for 126 yards and a touchdown against New Orleans. He may =
not be the most consistent Fantasy player, but the lack of tight end depth =
around the league makes him a valuable commodity.   Donovan McNabb , QB PHI=
 - AARP Updated 11/18/01 McNabb was unimpressive on Sunday, compiling only =
153 scrimmage yards and a touchdown against Dallas. Despite the mediocre pe=
rformance, McNabb is still one of the best Fantasy quarterbacks in the leag=
ue.   Ryan Leaf , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Leaf was horrible fo=
r the second straight week, throwing for only 102 yards with two intercepti=
ons. Incidently, both picks were returned for touchdowns as Dallas fell to =
Philadelphia, 36-3.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Little Bambinos Updated 11/18=
/01 Smith left Sunday's game against Philadelphia in the second half with a=
n apparent knee injury. He did not return to the game, and finished the day=
 with 90 scrimmage yards and a fumble.   More Updates  Transactions, View !=
