KINGDON DECREASES EXPOSURE TO THE ENERGY SECTOR

According to its 13F for the first quarter of 2001, Kingdon Capital
Management reported approximately $1.6 billion in equity assets invested in
a portfolio of 144 companies.  This is a slight decrease from the previous
quarter, in which the firm reported $1.9 billion in equity assets invested
in a portfolio of 167 companies.

Top five holdings for the quarter ended March 31, 2001, included:  Arbitron
Inc. [ARB] with 1,090,000 shares valued at $100.8 million; Philip Morris
Cos. Inc. [MO] with 1,250,000 shares valued at $59.3 million; Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. [GS] with 500,000 shares valued at $42.5 million; Waste
Management Inc. [WMI] with 1,700,000 shares valued at $42.0 million; and,
Orion Power Holdings Inc. [ORN] with 1,150,000 shares valued at $35.3
million.

The firm's holding in Arbitron represents the largest new position this
quarter.  Other new positions for the firm include: Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. [LEH] with 450,000 shares valued at $28.2 million; Tosco Corp. [TOS]
with 600,000 shares valued at $25.7 million; Amgen Inc. [AMGN] with 367,400
shares valued at $22.1 million; and, General Motors Corp. [GM] with 400,000
shares valued at $20.7 million.

Despite a quarter in which the tech-heavy Nasdaq's plunge seemed
never-ending, the firm remained heavily weighted in the sector, increasing
its tech holdings slightly from approximately 20.5% in the fourth quarter of
2000 to 21.7% in the first quarter of 2001.  Perhaps, the biggest change to
the firm's portfolio was found in its energy sector holdings.  In the fourth
quarter of 2001, approximately 9.3% (valued at $172.5 million) of the firm's
portfolio was invested in energy companies compared to the first quarter of
2001 in which the firm sold approximately three times as much than it
bought.  As of March 31, 2001, Kingdon's energy holdings dropped to 3.3% of
the portfolio with a value of $50.7 million.

The biggest increases were felt in the consumer cyclicals sector, which
represented 10.6% of the firm's portfolio for a value of $196.7 million at
the end of 2000.  As of March 31, 2001, the firm's holdings in the consumer
cyclicals sector increased to 17.4% of the portfolio for a value of $271.4
million.  This increase was led by purchases in General Motors, Ford Motor
Co. [F] with 700,000 shares valued at $19.7 million; Abercrombie & Fitch Co.
[ANF] with 500,000 shares valued at $16.4 million; and, Galileo
International Inc. [GLC] with 724,100 shares valued at $15.9 million.

HEDGE FUND PROFILE: STARO ASSET MANAGEMENT

BRIAN STARK and MICHAEL ROTH met years ago at the prestigious Harvard Law
School.  While both may have intended to pursue very successful careers in
law, they found their success in a very different area.  After graduation,
the duo parted ways; Stark moved to Denver where he handled general
commercial litigation, antitrust law and intellectual property cases.  Roth,
on the other hand, moved to Washington, D.C. where he handled bankruptcy
cases.  It wouldn't be long before Stark would take what was once a hobby
and turn in into his profession.

Investing had always been of great interest to Stark.  According to an
article written by the Business Journal- Milwaukee, while Stark attended law
school he researched and wrote a book on complex investment strategies like
hedging, arbitrage and liquidation. This book was a culmination of his
interest in investing which began at a very early age.  With the knowledge
Stark accumulated over the years in the research and writing of his book and
managing his own money, Stark took this experience and decided to apply it
to his own investment partnership.

Founded in 1987, Staro Asset Management originally opened in New York and
later moved to Mequon, WI in 1993. The firm manages the Shepherd Investments
International, Ltd., Stark Global Fund, Ltd., Stark Europe Fund, Ltd. and
the Stark Investments, L.P. hedge funds.

The firm expanded its investment prowess when it launched BayStar
Management, which manages the Baystar Capital LP hedge fund.  Stark and Roth
are joined in the venture by STEVE LAMAR and LARRY GOLDFARB.  According to
MAR/Hedge, the fund invests in public companies through the purchase of
individually-negotiated, privately-placed securities, relying heavily on
investing in convertible securities.

Staro Asset Management uses a combination of top-down and bottom-up
analysis. In the top-down approach, the firm uses proprietary qualitative
models to screen a global universe of convertible and risk arbitrage
opportunities. The quantitative screens evaluate a convertible's fair value,
attractiveness from a historical perspective, and expected return.
Qualitative factors considered include the fundamentals of the underlying
common stock, short-term supply and demand forces affecting either the
common stock or the convertible security, and default risk. The firm then
relies on its vast experience and expertise to decide which of the uncovered
opportunities are real and which are merely apparent.  The firm will
purchase or short sell a convertible bond, convertible preferred stock,
warrant or option, coupled with the respective short sale or purchase of the
underlying security of which the convertible can be exchanged. Through out
all of the firm's affiliated funds there are no restrictions or limitations
on what sector, market-cap, or country the firm can invest in, thought it
concentrates on the G-7 markets.  It uses the same screening and selection
process in the bottom-up approach applied in uncovering optimal
risk-adjusted opportunities.

The firm's primary objective is to achieve an uncorrelated, absolute return
of 15% to 20%, net of fees. The primary strategy of the firm is convertible
hedging, which typically represents 70% to 90% of overall investing. Other
strategies are used on an opportunistic basis and will differ per fund.  In
its convertible hedging strategy, the firm will take advantage of temporary
mispricings between related securities to create positions that generate
significant streams of cash flow.  The firm finds the most attractively
priced convertible products in out-of-favor sectors.

In a shareholder letter dated May 4, 2001, the firm detailed its outlook on
the global market, stating, "We have continued to decrease our exposure to
merger arbitrage and re-deploy the capital into other arbitrage strategies
that currently offer much more attractive risk/return profiles."  The letter
goes on to state that, "In convertible arbitrage, potential opportunities in
the near term are abundant."

According to HedgeWorld, Staro Asset Management has approximately $1.5
billion in assets under management.

SHAREHOLDER ACTIVISTS UP THEIR DEMANDS

Many activist funds have continued to grow as a depressed stock market has
left many smaller cap companies with decreasing stock prices, making them
prime targets for corporate raiders and management shake-ups.   Many firms
are reluctant to become too active, instead trying to keep a low profile and
involving themselves when they believe their interest is not being
adequately represented.  Recently, Harvard Management Company entered the
fray when a company it was involved in received a tender offer.  While the
firm felt the tender offer fell short of the company's true value, it had to
take it, unable to persuade other shareholders of its position.

Many socially responsibly funds have also increasingly used proxy statements
to push their own agendas.  BP Amoco Plc - ADR [BP] recently faced a
shareholder proxy that would have forced the company to phase out its
production of oil and gas and instead focus on more environmentally friendly
means of energy production.  The measure failed, but had a good deal of
support from some pension funds and other institutional managers that have
had a record of support for environmental causes.

In a 13G filed in late October 2000, notable financier Carl C. Icahn
declared a 9.9% stake in VISX, Inc. [EYE].  However, Icahn recently failed
in his bid to oust the board of the eye surgery equipment maker.  Icahn had
repeatedly railed again VISX's management, hoping to elect his own nominees
to the company's board.

Memphis, TN-based Southeastern Asset Management, Inc. has made sizable gains
through its activist $3.4 billion Longleaf Partners Fund.  The fund was up
20.6% in an otherwise brutal 2000, and it was up 5.3% through April 30, 2001
according to Morningstar.  The fund is a traditional GARP investor, which
also takes into account, the underlying value of a company in the event of a
turnaround, or outright sale.  Stocks are purchased on current and projected
free cash flow, or cash profits minus expenditures necessary to run the
business.  When evaluating pricing, the firm determines a company's
liquidation value, or the sum of what a company's pieces would sell for on
the open market.

From January 6 to March 2, 2000, Southeastern Asset Management acquired
approximately 8.47 million shares of Aetna, Inc. [AET] according to a 13D
filing with the SEC dated March 8, 2000.  That gave Southeastern a 6.0%
share in the Hartford, CT-based insurer.   Aetna had been battered in the
market and many shareholders wanted to see the company spin off its less
profitable businesses.  In that filing, Southeastern announced its
interaction with other parties to determine the best way to increase Aetna's
true economic value.  About 1.77 million of the shares purchased were for
Southeastern's Longleaf Partners Fund.

"In this situation," the filing reported "Southeastern has had conversations
with third parties, and intends to have additional conversations with these
and one or more other third parties and/or the Issuer's management,
regarding actions or transactions." Southeastern typically works closely
with management to determine the best way to increase shareholder value.

Aetna had received a joint bid from Dutch financial company ING Group NV and
WellPoint Health Networks. ING was interested in Aetna's financial services
while WellPoint was interested in Aetna's U.S. HealthCare wing.
Southeastern's efforts were foiled, however, when Aetna sold off it's
financial services arm, while holding on to its health care operations.
Since then, Longleaf has slightly eased off on its stake, but still kept the
majority of its holding.

Top five holdings for the Longleaf Partners Fund as of March 31, 2001
included: Marriott International Inc. New [MAR] with 9,966,000 shares
(valued at $410.4 million); Waste Management Inc. Del [WMI] with 15,096,300
shares (valued at $372.9 million); General Motors Corp. [GM] with 5,000,000
shares (valued at $259.3 million); FedEx Corp. [FDX] with 5,615,000 shares
(valued at $234.0 million); and, Tricon Global Restaurants Inc. [YUM] with
5,615,000 shares (valued at $217.3 million).

Other funds have also adopted more intrusive activist programs.  The
California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) believes that good
corporate governance means the difference between short-term setback and
long-term financial difficulty.  CalPERS spent many years simply reacting to
situations, such as takeovers.  The firm has since taken a more proactive
approach to investments in adopting its Corporate Governance Core Principles
and Guidelines to achieve this end.

The firm believes that some measure must be taken to achieve long-term
profitability, but that some investors may not be willing to wait out
short-term difficulties.  The guidelines, however, are not absolute.
CalPERS readily realizes that some firm's are constrained by competitive
pressures, as well as a myriad of other factors.

The firm likes to see independent board members, and an open, shareholder
friendly environment.  This typically means the banning of greenmail and an
accessible CEO who is free of additional constraints and is capable of
acting in the best interests of shareholders.  Most important, in their
evaluation, is the appearance of an independent board of directors.

Hedge fund Wynnefield Capital Management L.L.C. has also recently entered
the fray.  The firm's Wynnefield Partners Small Cap Value L.P. recently
submitted a shareholder proposal to the board of directors at Airgas, Inc.
[ARG]. The firm is pushing for the company to sell itself or to seek out new
strategic partnerships.  The measure will go before shareholders at the
firm's annual meeting in August 2001.

Wynnefield's top five holdings for the quarter ended March 31, 2001
included: Sylvan Inc. [SYLN] with 1,068,886 shares (valued at $13.4
million); Pricesmart Inc. [PSMT] with 310,000 shares (valued at $12.1
million); First Aviation Services Inc. [FAVS] with 2,066,892 shares (valued
at $10.1 million); Delta & Pine Land Co. [DLP] with 275,500 shares (valued
at $6.6 million); and, CTB International Corp. [CTBC] with 723,500 shares
(valued at $6.3 million).

Many companies' boards of directors are under increasing outside pressure.
Growing demands on management from shareholders is increasingly an
inevitable part of the future.
