 =09 =09    Dear Jason,  It's official: Sen. Jim Jeffords is leaving the Re=
publican Party and declares himself an Independent.  This move is going to =
have repercussions touching aspects in every area of legislation, and will =
undoubtedly affect the national energy policy.  We'll continue to update yo=
u on this situation from our Washington bureau.     Republicans and Democra=
ts are nearing an agreement on the Electricity Emergency Relief Act.  Compr=
omise language is being discussed behind closed doors, and members hope to =
resolve their differences when the markup continues Friday morning.   In a =
continuing effort to promote the Bush administration's energy plan, the Dep=
artment of Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham is scheduled to travel to a nuc=
lear power plant in Maryland on Friday.  Correspondent Peter Cook is schedu=
led to be along for the ride.  Tuesday, Peter brings us details of his trip=
 to Maryland.    Also on Friday, I'm scheduled to speak with U.S. Chamber o=
f Commerce Vice President of Energy Policy William Kovacs. He'll join us fr=
om Washington, D.C. to preview an energy meeting at the U.S. Chamber of Com=
merce where Vice President Dick Cheney will talk about the White House ener=
gy plan.  Catch my interview with Kovacs in the 11:00 a.m. ET newscast.    =
 ENL's Gale Smith reports the Houston bureau is scheduled to give us an upd=
ate from the ongoing story of 70,000 royalty owners who are filing a class =
action lawsuit against ExxonMobil.  The royalty owners allege Exxon unfairl=
y determined the royalties they should receive from natural gas and natural=
 gas liquids sales.  On Wednesday, a San Antonio U.S. District Judge certif=
ied the lawsuit filed by a Houston law firm.  Gale says the Houston bureau =
will bring you reactions from Exxon officials on Friday.     Dorothea El Ma=
llakh, the Executive Director of the International Research Center for Ener=
gy and Economic Development is also scheduled to join us from our Houston b=
ureau.  She says conservation is not synonymous with deprivation, and the c=
urrent energy issue is not a problem with a quick solution.  We'll bring yo=
u more from Mallakh in the 10:00 a.m. ET newscast on Friday.   Keep in mind=
 things are subject to change at a moment's notice.  Occasionally guests ca=
