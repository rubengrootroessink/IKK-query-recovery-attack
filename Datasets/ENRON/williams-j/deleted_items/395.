nt Updated 11/20/01 Watters' shoulder has not sufficiently healed enough fo=
r him to practice, says the Seattle Times. He is not expected to return for=
 another two to three weeks, meaning Shaun Alexander will continue to be a =
key performer for many Fantasy teams as the postseason comes into view.  Do=
ug Flutie , QB SD - Russell Updated 11/20/01 Mike Riley told the San Diego =
Union-Tribune there is no QB controversy involving Flutie! a! nd rookie Dre=
w Brees. "Doug is going to be our quarterback," he said. "You can talk abou=
t controversy all you want, but there is none within this building. He is o=
ur quarterback. He will start. He will get us the next win the next week." =
Still, Flutie is not playing well enought to satisfy most Fantasy owners.  =
Mark Bruener , TE PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Bruener will miss the r=
est of the season after undergoing shoulder injury. His loss may adversely =
affect Jerome Bettis' statistics, because Bruener is widely regarded as the=
 best run-blocking tight end in football.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Giggl=
! es! Updated 11/20/01 Wheatley told the Contra-Costa Times he is no longer=
 being bothered by a knee injury. He expects to play on Sunday.  Erron Kinn=
ey , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Kinney (calf) may play this week =
after missing three games. He was expected to return to practice early this=
 week.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Matty Updated 11/20/01 Wycheck (calf) will=
 be limited in practice this week. He may be a risky start in Week 11.  Ste=
ve McNair , QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 The Tennessean says McNair=
's hand was sore when he arrived at the team's practice facility on Monday.=
 Jeff Fisher now says he doesn't expect him to miss any practice time this =
week.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - JWillie Updated 11/20/01 Alexander (rib=
s) has returned to practice. He is expected to start against Seattle.  Marv=
in Minnis , WR KC - Free Agent Updated! 1! 1/20/01 Minnis (ankle) is listed=
 as doubtful for Sunday's game. Larry Parker may have to start in his place=
,  Mark Brunell , QB JAC - JWillie Updated 11/20/01 Brunell (quadriceps) mi=
ght miss Sunday's game against Baltimore. Jonathan Quinn will start again i=
f Brunell can't play.  Mark Brunell , QB JAC - JWillie Updated 11/20/01 Bru=
nell (quadriceps) might miss Sunday's game against Baltimore. Jonathan Quin=
n will start again if Brunell can't play.  Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Age=
nt Updated 11/20/01 Wayne has a sprained knee ligament, and is doubtful for=
 Sunday's game against New Orleans. Terrence Wilkins may have to start in h=
is place.  Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Tori Updated 11/20/01 Pathon (foot) is =
done for the season. He will be put on injured reserve. Reggie Wayne (knee)=
 is also hurting, meaning Terrence Wilkins might have to be moved back into=
 the starting lineup.   Jay Fiedler , QB MIA ! - ! Tori Updated 11/20/01 Da=
ve Wannstedt told the Miami Herald there is no QB controversy surrounding F=
ielder and backup Ray right now. ``That's kind of hypothetical,'' he said. =
``Jay is the starter, and my only comment is we're going to get it squared =
away and play turnover-free football.''  Rod Smith , WR DEN - Matty Updated=
 11/20/01 Mike Shanahan said he does not know if Smith (ankle) will be suff=
iciently healed to play in Thursday's game against the Cowboys. "We'll get =
a chance to evaluate that during the week and see," Shanahan told the Denve=
r Post. "If he can help our football team, he'll play. If he's in a situati=
on where he can't perform at the level that we think can help our team, the=
n we'll! k! eep him out and put somebody else in."   Benjamin Gay , RB CLE =
- Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 The Cleveland Plain-Dealer says Butch Davis w=
on't indicate how much Gay will play in the near future. "We'll try to get =
him involved in some of the games," Davis said. "We'll see."   Kevin Locket=
t , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Lockett, who suffered a rib injury=
 last weekend against Denver, expects to play on Sunday against Philadelphi=
a. However, the wide receiver has no real value as a Fantasy player at this=
 point. Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Barring any setba=
cks, Banks will start Sunday's game against Philadelphia. Banks, who suffer=
ed a concussion last weekend vs. Denver, hasn't been feeling any after effe=
cts of the injury and should be under center for the 'Skins.   Jacquez Gree=
n , WR TB - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Green (abdomen) is expected to retu=
rn to practice on Wednesday at full strength. He's been inconsistent this s=
eason, and is best used when the matchup is favorable.   Terrell Owens , WR=
 SF - Martin Updated 11/20/01 Owens suffered a sprained left knee and ankle=
 during the overtime session of last weekend's game against Carolina. The i=
njuries aren't considered serious, however, and Owens is expected to be in =
the starting lineup on Sunday Indianapolis.   Cecil Martin , RB PHI - Free =
Agent Updated 11/20/01 Martin suffered a hamstring injury during Sunday's g=
ame against Dallas. He'll miss a few days of practice, but is expected to p=
lay in this weekend's game against Washington. Martin has no real value as =
a Fantasy player at this point.    Giants , DT NYG - Matty Updated 11/20/01=
 According to the New York Post, cornerback Jason Sehorn's surgically-repai=
red right knee began giving him problems again this past weekend. In fact, =
the team was unsure that he'd be able to cover either Randy Moss or Cris Ca=
rter on Monday night, but he played anyway. If he continues to play on a ba=
d wheel, you should consider starting any receivers opposing Sehorn the res=
t of the season.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 The B=
altimore Sun says there is no indication that Grbac will be repl! ac! ed as=
 the team's starting QB. Still, he is not performing well enough to start f=
or most Fantasy teams.  Donald Driver , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01=
 Driver is still dealing with a thigh injury, and is expected to miss Thurs=
day's game against Detroit. The reserve wideout has no real value as a Fant=
asy player at this point.    Ravens , DT BAL - Russell Updated 11/20/01 Def=
ensive end Michael McCrary will miss the rest of the season after undergoin=
g knee surgery. His loss will certainly lower the sack output of the Baltim=
ore defense and may mean the team will allow more passing yardage than usua=
l.    Cowboys , DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Linebacker Dexter Coak=
ley, who was expected to miss two weeks due to a sprained knee, will likely=
 get the start on Thursday after being out for just one game. He'll help ke=
ep Denver's running game in check, but don't expect his presence to give Da=
llas' defense added Fantasy value as a whole.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Bas=
s/Hull Updated 11/20/01 Smith (knee) will start on Thursday's game against =
Denver. "I'm not 100 percent, but I'm healthy enough to do my job," Smith t=
old the Dallas Morning Star. He'll struggle to post solid Fantasy numbers d=
ue to Dallas' horrid passing game, so bench him this week if at all possibl=
e.     Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/20/01 Hayes suffered bruis=
ed ribs during Sunday's game against San Francisco. He may miss some practi=
ce time this week, but he's expected to play this weekend against Atlanta. =
The Falcons secondary is one of the worst in the league, so Hayes could tur=
n into a good sleeper pick in Week 11.   Terry Hardy , TE ARI - Free Agent =
Updated 11/20/01 Hardy is expected to return to practice this week after mi=
ssing three games due to shoulder injury. However, he is not certain to pla=
y on Sunday against San Diego.   Jackie Harris , TE DAL - Free Agent Update=
d 11/20/01 Harris is out for Thursday's game against Denver due to a hamstr=
ing injury. Harris has been an unreliable Fantasy player and is only worth =
a roster spot in deeper leagues.   More Updates  [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Co=
