 Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Correll Buckhalter , RB PHI - Free=
 Agent Updated 11/17/01 Buckhalter has been suspended for this weekend's ga=
me against Dallas. He is one of three Eagles who will be held out of the ga=
me. Brian Mitchell will likely serve as Duce Staley's backup.  Jamal Lewis =
, RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/17/01 According to published reports, Lewi=
s has been suspended for four games. Lewis' four-game suspension went into =
effect on Friday and he will not be allowed to work out or rehabili! ta! te=
 with the team for four weeks, or until Dec. 17. Instead, Lewis will work t=
oward recovering from a torn ACL in Tennessee.   Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK -=
 Giggles Updated 11/16/01 Wheatley (knee) is out for Sunday's game with the=
 Chargers. Charlie Garner will once again be Oakland's feature back. Zack C=
rockett may be used in goal-line situations.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Matt=
y Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Wycheck is expected to p=
lay half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That makes him a risky start =
from a Fantasy persp! ec! tive.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Free Agent Update=
d 11/16/01 McNair's status is still in question for Sunday's game against C=
incinnati due to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball during individua=
l drills Friday, and according to published reports, is likely to play desp=
ite not being 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week as a result.=
  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/16/01 Smith will return to t=
he lineup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two games with a sprain=
ed right knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Friday's pra! ct! i=
ce that Smith would "be ready to play the majority of the game." His return=
 bumps Troy Hambrick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend you use either =
back against the stingy Eagles rush defense.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free=
 Agent Updated 11/16/01 Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury rep=
ort on Friday and is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game against D=
etroit.  However, if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a larger =
league this week, Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary i=
s worth considering as long as he's able to play.    Chris Weinke , QB CAR =
- Tori Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Weinke will be the =
starting quarterback for Sunday's game against San Francisco. However, he's=
 not worth starting on your Fantasy team.   Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - Gig=
gles Updated 11/16/01 Culpepper is one pace for a good Fantasy season despi=
te the lack of consistency in Minnesota's offense this season. He's one of =
the better quarterbacks in the league from a Fantasy perspective, and shoul=
d be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.   Cris Carter , WR MIN - To=
ri Updated 11/16/01Carter's numbers may be down somewhat this season, but h=
e's still too good to ever consider benching. The veteran has a knack for f=
inding the end zone, and should have a good game against rookie CB Will All=
en and the Giants' secondary on Monday night.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - Russe=
ll Updated 11/16/01 Moss is listed as probable for Monday's game against th=
e N.Y. Giants due to an ankle injury. He's been underachieving this season,=
 but it's almost impossible to bench him based on his potential to post sol=
id Fantasy numbers.   Ricky Williams , RB NO - Bass/Hull Updated 11/16/01 W=
illiams is one of the better Fantasy backs in the league, and is a good pla=
yer to use on a weekly basis. He'll face an Indianapolis defense that has b=
een underachieving all season long, so Williams is a must-start.     Aaron =
Brooks , QB NO - Matty Updated 11/16/01 Brooks had a big game against San F=
rancisco last weekend, throwing for 347 yards and two scores. He may be a b=
it inconsistent this season, but his potential to post huge numbers makes i=
t tough to bench him, especially against a vulnerable Indianapolis defense.=
    Willie Jackson! , WR NO - Martin Updated 11/16/01Jackson put up a huge =
game against San Francisco last weekend, posting 11 catches and 167 yards r=
eceiving. He'll face a questionable Indianapolis squad that is vulnerable t=
o the pass in Week 10, so starting Jackson this week is a solid option.  St=
ephen Davis , RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 11/16/01 Davis has stepped up his =
play after beginning the season slowly. He's averaged 112 yards rushing ove=
r his last four games, and is once again emerging as a reliable Fantasy pla=
yer. Give him the start in Week 10 against a Denver defense that is vulnera=
ble to high scoring games.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16=
/01 Banks has played well of late, throwing five touchdowns in his last thr=
ee games. He's got a good matchup this weekend against a Denver team that c=
an be beaten through the air, but he's only worth considering in very deep =
Fantasy leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01=
 Westbrook has been inconsistent this season, but he has caught three touch=
down passes in his last four games. He'll face a Denver secondary this week=
end that is vulnerable at best, so starting him in deeper leagues is wo! rt=
! h considering.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Gardn=
er has been held in check in his last two games, catching only three passes=
 for 38 yards. He does have a favorable matchup this weekend against Denver=
, however, so starting him is a good move.   Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Neal=
/McKay Updated 11/16/01 Hakim has been inconsistent in recent weeks, so sta=
rting him on your Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is right. He'=
ll go up against a tough New England secondary in Week Ten, so avoid using =
him outside of deeper! l! eagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - Tori Updated 11/1=
6/01 Holt continues to put up consistent yardage totals, but he's only scor=
ed only three touchdowns this season. He'll face a tough New England second=
ary this weekend, but he's still worth starting on your Fantasy team based =
on his potential to put up solid numbers.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL - Frank Up=
dated 11/16/01 Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy totals this season, but=
 he's still one of the better wideouts in the league. He'll face CB Ty Law =
and the formidable New England secondary, but he's still wort! h ! starting=
 based on his potential for big numbers.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Matty =
Updated 11/16/01 Faulk had a huge game against Carolina, proving that he is=
 still the best Fantasy player in the league. He's a must-start every week,=
 and should post solid numbers in Week 10 against New England.   Ernie Conw=
ell , TE STL - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Conwell has had a few down weeks=
, so starting him on your Fantasy team is somewhat of a gamble. With the la=
ck of depth at tight end around the league, however, starting Conwell is so=
mething many Fantasy owners will have no choice but to do.   Richard Huntle=
y , RB CAR - Russell Updated 11/16/01 Huntley will be the likely starter th=
is weekend against San Francisco, but don't be surprised if he splits carri=
es with Nick Goings. Avoid starting either back in Week 10 if at all possib=
le.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/16/01 Hayes had ! on! ly tw=
o catches for 11 yards last weekend against St. Louis. He's been unreliable=
 for Fantasy owners this season, so starting him is a real gamble.    Wesle=
y Walls , TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Walls has been held in check=
 over the last three weeks, but he's still one of the better tight ends in =
the league. He's had some success against San Francisco in the past, so sta=
rting him is advisable.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/16/0=
1 Muhammad finally had a somewhat productive game, catching six passes for =
75 yards against St. Louis. He's had some success in the past against this =
week's opponent, San Francisco, so starting him is a decent move.   Brett F=
avre , QB GB - Frank Updated 11/16/01 Favre has been one of the best Fantas=
y quarterbacks in the league this season. He'll face an Atlanta team on Sun=
day with a very vulnerable secondary, so be sure to start Favre this week. =
  Bubba Franks , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Franks may not put up =
huge yardage numbers, ! bu! t his seven touchdowns in eight games makes him=
 a valuable Fantasy player. Unless you have a better option on your roster,=
 Franks is the type of tight end that should start on a weekly basis.    Bi=
ll Schroeder , WR GB - Frank Updated 11/16/01 Schroeder (ankle) is not list=
ed on the NFL injury report, and is expected to start on Sunday against Atl=
anta. He's a solid play this week against Atlanta, whose secondary is vulne=
rable to strong passing teams like Green Bay.   More Updates  ! Schedule, B=
