n placed on injured reserve and is out for the remainder of the 2001 season=
. The big tight end has no real value as a Fantasy player.   Mark Brunell ,=
 QB JAC - Hollowman Updated 11/18/01 Brunell (quadriceps) will start on Sun=
day against Pittsburgh. He'll be facing a tough Steelers' secondary at less=
 than 100 percent, however, so Fantasy owners may want to consider benching=
 him in Week 10.   Fred Taylor , RB JAC - The Internet Potatoes Updated 11/=
18/01 Taylor (groin) practiced without incident on Friday, but he still nee=

. Even is he is able to play, however, he'd only be used on a limited basis=

ans, according to the Indianapolis Star. Reggie Wayne will start in Pathon'=

e. If the rookie tailback is unable to play, Jamel White will be Cleveland'=

ll.   Correll Buckhalter , RB PHI - Little Bambinos Updated 11/17/01 Buckha=
lter has been suspended for this weekend's game against Dallas. He is one o=
f three Eagles who will be held out of the game. Brian Mitchell will likely=
 serve as Duce Staley's backup.  Jamal Lewis , RB BAL - Free Agent Updated =
11/17/01 According to! p! ublished reports, Lewis has been suspended for fo=
ur games. Lewis' four-game suspension went into effect on Friday and he wil=
l not be allowed to work out or rehabilitate with the team for four weeks, =
or until Dec. 17. Instead, Lewis will work toward recovering from a torn AC=
L in Tennessee.   Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Hatcher's Right Nut Updated 11=
/16/01 Wheatley (knee) is out for Sunday's game with the Chargers. Charlie =
Garner will once again be Oakland's feature back. Zack Crockett may be used=
 in goal-line situations.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Threesome Updated 11/16=
/01 According to published reports, Wycheck is expected to play half of Sun=
day's game against Cincinnati. That makes him a risky start from a Fantasy =
perspective.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Hatcher's Right Nut Updated 11/16/01 =
McNair's status is still in question for Sunday's game against Cincinnati d=
ue to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball during individual drills Fr=
iday, and according to published reports, is likely to play despite not bei=
ng 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week as a result.  Emmitt Sm=
ith , RB DAL - Little Bambinos Updated 11/16/01 Smith will return to the li=
neup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two games with a sprained ri=
ght knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Friday's practice that S=
mith would "be ready to play the majority of the game." His return bumps Tr=
oy Hambrick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend you use either back agai=
nst the stingy Eagles rush defense.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent Up=
dated 11/16/01 Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury report on Fr=
iday and is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Detroit.  =
However, if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a larger league th=
is week, Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary is worth c=
onsidering as long as he's able to play! . !   Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Free=
 Agent Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Weinke will be the =
starting quarterback for Sunday's game against San Francisco. However, he's=
 not worth starting on your Fantasy team.   Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - Thr=
eesome Updated 11/16/01 Culpepper is one pace for a good Fantasy season des=
pite the lack of consistency in Minnesota's offense this season. He's one o=
f the better quarterbacks in the league from a Fantasy perspective, and sho=
uld be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.   Cris Carter , WR MIN - =
The Internet Potatoes Updated 11/16/01 Carter's numbers may be down somewha=
t this season, but he's still too good to ever consider benching. The veter=
an has a knack for finding the end zone, and should have a good game agains=
t rookie CB Will Allen and the Giants' secondary on Monday night.   Randy M=
oss , WR MIN - Road Rage Updated 11/16/01 Moss is listed as probable for Mo=
nday's game against the N.Y. Giants due to an ankle injury. He's been under=
achieving this season, but it's almost impossible to bench him based on his=
 potential to post solid Fantasy numb! er! s.   Ricky Williams , RB NO - Ro=
ad Rage Updated 11/16/01 Williams is one of the better Fantasy backs in the=
 league, and is a good player to use on a weekly basis. He'll face an India=
napolis defense that has been underachieving all season long, so Williams i=
s a must-start.     Aaron Brooks , QB NO - Road Rage Updated 11/16/01 Brook=
s had a big game against San Francisco last weekend, throwing for 347 yards=
 and two scores. He may be a bit inconsistent this season, but his potentia=
l to post huge numbers makes it tough to bench him, especially against a vu=
lnerabl! e ! Indianapolis defense.    Willie Jackson , WR NO - Cocked and L=
ocked Updated 11/16/01 Jackson put up a huge game against San Francisco las=
t weekend, posting 11 catches and 167 yards receiving. He'll face a questio=
nable Indianapolis squad that is vulnerable to the pass in Week 10, so star=
ting Jackson this week is a solid option.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Hatche=
r's Right Nut Updated 11/16/01 Davis has stepped up his play after beginnin=
g the season slowly. He's averaged 112 yards rushing over his last four gam=
es, and is once again emerging as a reliable Fantasy player. Give him the s=
tart in Week 10 against a Denver defense that is vulnerable to high scoring=
 games.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Banks has playe=
d well of late, throwing five touchdowns in his last three games. He's got =
a good matchup this weekend against a Denver team that can be beaten throug=
h the air, but he's only worth considering in very deep Fantasy leagues.   =
Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Westbrook has been=
 inconsistent this season, but he has caught three touchdown passes in his =
last four games. He'll face a Denver secondary this weekend that is vulnera=
ble at best, so starting him in deeper leagues is worth considering.   Rod =
Gardner , WR WAS - The Internet Potatoes Updated 11/16/01 Gardner has been =
held in check in his last two games, catching only three passes for 38 yard=
s. He does have a favorable matchup this weekend against Denver, however, s=
o starting him is a good move.   Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Little Bambino! =
s ! Updated 11/16/01 Hakim has been inconsistent in recent weeks, so starti=
ng him on your Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is right. He'll =
go up against a tough New England secondary in Week Ten, so avoid using him=
 outside of deeper leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - Road Rage Updated 11/16=
/01 Holt continues to put up consistent yardage totals, but he's only score=
d only three touchdowns this season. He'll face a tough New England seconda=
ry this weekend, but he's still worth starting on your Fantasy team based o=
n his potential to put up solid numbers.   Isaac! B! ruce , WR STL - Hollow=
man Updated 11/16/01 Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy totals this seaso=
n, but he's still one of the better wideouts in the league. He'll face CB T=
y Law and the formidable New England secondary, but he's still worth starti=
ng based on his potential for big numbers.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - AARP=
 Updated 11/16/01 Faulk had a huge game against Carolina, proving that he i=
s still the best Fantasy player in the league. He's a must-start every week=
, and should post solid numbers in Week 10 against New England.   More ! Up=
