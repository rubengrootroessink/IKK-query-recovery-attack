      <p>Dear Jennifer,</p> 
<!-- Copy in each day's wrap up specifics after this point. --> 
<p>Two large mergers are done deals.  Valero Energy is buying rival Ultramar 
Diamond Shamrock for $4 billion in cash and the assumption of $2 billion in 
debt today.  The acquisition creates the second-largest refiner of petroleum 
products in the U.S. Williams Energy, parent company of ENL, also completed 
a $2.8 billion deal to buy Denver-based Barrett Resources.  The deal more 
than doubles Williams' natural gas reserves, and now makes Williams a 
producer and distributor of natural gas.  Today ENL brought you interviews 
with the CEOs from all four companies.  If you happened to miss it, log onto 
the ENL website and click on "video library" to see the interviews in full. 
<p>ENL's Washington Bureau Chief Jay Cranford leaves for California early 
tomorrow.  Jay is scheduled to cover the meeting between California Gov. 
Gray Davis and 12 energy companies.  The agenda of the meeting will include 
discussion of unpaid debts, credit and the supply of power in California. 
Log on for updates from California with ENL's Jay Cranford. 
<p>Tomorrow, the Houston bureau will report on the Rig Insight Company.  Kim 
Benestante tells us this company offers a web-based platform where other 
companies can access rig data such as day-rates and availability.  Be sure 
to catch this report from Houston tomorrow.  Later in the week, Kim will 
take a trip to Texas Southern University for an interview with Dr. Joshua 
Hill to talk about the University's solar technology department.  Kim says 
TSU has the largest solar lab facility in the South, and produces solar 
panels for use all over the world.  Log on Friday when ENL sheds some light 
on the solar panel issue. 
<p>Coming up tomorrow, Cook Inlet's Gregory Craig is scheduled to join us 
from our Houston bureau.  Craig will be in to discuss Cook Inlet's joint 
venture with Mirant.  We'll bring you all the details in the 10:00 a.m. EST 
broadcast. 
<p>This is a dynamic industry and things are subject to change at a moment's 
notice.  Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to 
do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.
