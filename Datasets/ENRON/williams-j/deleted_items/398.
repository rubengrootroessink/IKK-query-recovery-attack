, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Tony Martin , WR ATL - Fre=
e Agent Updated 11/21/01 Martin hasn't been a reliable Fantasy player at al=
l this season, but he could have a decent outing against Carolina. The Pant=
hers secondary is one of the worst in the league, so starting Martin in dee=
per Fantasy leagues may be worth considering.   Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Fr=
ee Agent Updated 11/21/01 Sanders is dealing with two tight hamstrings, but=
 he's expected to play on Sunday against San Diego. The Chargers' secondary=
 hasn't be! en! playing well of late, so giving Sanders some consideration =
in deeper leagues is advisable.   David Boston , WR ARI - Cocked and Locked=
 Updated 11/21/01 Boston has become one of the premier wide receivers in Fa=
ntasy Football. He's posted three touchdowns and 217 yards receiving in his=
 last two games, and should have another solid game vs. San Diego in Week 1=
1.   Tom Brady , QB NE - Cocked and Locked Updated 11/21/01 Patriots Head C=
oach Bill Belichick announced late Monday that Brady will remain the starti=
ng quarterback for the remainder of the season, barring injury. This relega=
tes Drew Bledsoe to a backup role and makes him useless from a Fantasy pers=
pective. Brady might have his hands full passing against the Saints on Sund=
ay, but he is a fairly safe weekly starter otherwise.   Dolphins , DT MIA -=
 The Great Bald Hunter Updated 11/21/01 Defensive tackle Daryl Gardener cou=
ld miss the remainder of the season due to a fragmented disc in his back. H=
e will miss at least one month to rest and rehabilitate the injury before b=
eing re-evaluated. Gardener's absence hurts the Dolphins' rush defense, whi=
ch might be burned a little more by opposing running backs in the upcoming =
weeks.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Hatcher's Right Nut Updated 11/21/01 Minnis=
 is unlikely to be available for Sunday's game against Seattle due to the s=
prained ankle he suffered during a Nov. 11 game against the Jets. He will b=
e replaced by Chris Thomas in the lineup at split end, and you should keep =
him reserved for this week.  Mark Brunell , QB JAC - Hollowman Updated 11/2=
1/01 Brunell's nagging leg injury might sideline him for Sunday's game agai=
nst Baltimore. He decided about two hours before last Sunday's kickoff that=
 he couldn't play against Pittsburgh due to a strained right quadriceps. Jo=
nathan Quinn has been preparing as if he will start the game, so right now =
you shouldn't count on Brunell this week as you set your lineups.  Fred Tay=
lor , RB JAC - The Internet Potatoes Updated 11/21/01 Taylor received a sec=
ond medical opinion Tuesday that indicated his severe groin injury could ke=
ep him out up to three months and possibly the remainder of the season, acc=
ording to the Florida Times-Union. The diagnosis was that the injury still =
has not healed and will need more time to become healthy, and in the meanti=
me Taylor has deve! lo! ped pain in his hip, a side effect of the injury. I=
t's sounding more and more like Taylor will not play again this Fantasy sea=
son, although you should probably hold onto him until a final decision is r=
eached, provided you have a deep enough bench.  Rod Smith , WR DEN - Hatche=
r's Right Nut Updated 11/21/01 Smith's sprained ankle was not healed enough=
 for him to practice on Tuesday, and there is a real chance he might miss T=
hursday's game against Dallas. He suffered the injury Nov. 11, and aggravat=
ed it during Sunday's game. You should probably play it safe and keep Smith=
 on your bench for this week. Temper your expectations for the entire Bronc=
os' offense as well - the Cowboys' D isn't the pushover many believed it wo=
uld be prior to the season. ! Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - Hollowman Updated =
11/20/01 With Ricky Watters expected to miss another two to three weeks, Al=
exander will remain the focal point of many contending Fantasy teams during=
 their charge to the playoffs. He should roll up some fine numbers against =
the Chiefs this week.  Tom Brady , QB NE - Cocked and Locked Updated 11/20/=
01 The Patriots will stick with Brady for now, and Drew Bledsoe will remain=
 the team's No. 2 QB. "I don't see any changes this week," coach Bill Belic=
hick said. Brady is a solid Fantasy starter right now, but add Bledsoe to !=
 yo! ur roster as an insurance policy if you can.  Jonathan Quinn , QB JAC =
- Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Quinn may have to start in place of Mark Brun=
ell (quadriceps) again this week. Brunell's status is still unclear for Sun=
day's game.  Ricky Watters , RB SEA - The Internet Potatoes Updated 11/20/0=
1 Watters' shoulder has not sufficiently healed enough for him to practice,=
 says the Seattle Times . He is not expected to return for another two to t=
hree weeks, meaning Shaun Alexander will continue to be a key performer for=
 many Fantasy teams as the postseason comes into view.  Doug Flutie , QB SD=
 - The Internet Potatoes Updated 11/20/01 Mike Riley told the San Diego Uni=
on-Tribune there is no QB controversy involving Flutie and rookie Drew Bree=
s. "Doug is going to be our quarterback," he said. "You can talk about cont=
roversy all you want, but there is none within this building. He is our qua=
rterback. He will start. He will get us the next win the next week." Still,=
 Flutie is not playing well enought to satisfy most Fantasy owners.  Mark B=
ruener , TE PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Bruener will miss the rest of=
 the season after undergoing shoulder injury. His loss may adversely affect=
 Jerome Bettis' statistics, because Bruener is widely regarded as the best =
run-blocking tight end in football.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Hatcher's R=
ight Nut Updated 11/20/01 Wheatley told the Contra-Consta Times he is no lo=
nger being bothered by a knee injury. He expects to play on Sunday.  Erron =
Kinney , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20! /0!  Kinney (calf) may play thi=
s week after missing three games. He was expected to return to practice ear=
ly this week.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Threesome Updated 11/20/01 Wycheck =
(calf) will be limited in practice this week. He may be a risky start in We=
ek 11.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Hatcher's Right Nut Updated 11/20/01 The Te=
nnessean says McNair's hand was sore when he arrived at the team's practice=
 facility on Monday. Jeff Fisher now says he doesn't expect him to miss any=
 practice time this week.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - Cocked and Locked U=
pdated 11/20/01 Alexander (ribs) has returned to practice. He is expected t=
o start against Seattle.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Hatcher's Right Nut Updat=
ed 11/20/01 Minnis (ankle) is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game. Larry P=
arker may have to start in his place,  Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent U=
pdated 11/20/01 Wayne has a sprained knee ligament, and is doubtful for Sun=
day's game against New Orleans. Terrence Wilkins may have to start in his p=
lace.  Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Little Bambinos Updated 11/20/01 Pathon (fo=
ot) is done for the season. He will be put on injured reserve. Reggie Wayne=
 (knee) is also hurting, meaning Terrence Wilkins might have to be moved ba=
ck into the starting lineup.   Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - The Great Bald Hunter=
 Updated 11/20/01 Dave Wannstedt told the Miami Herald there is no QB contr=
oversy surrounding Fie! ld! er and backup Ray right now. ``That's kind of h=
ypothetical,'' he said. ``Jay is the starter, and my only comment is we're =
going to get it squared away and play turnover-free football.''  Rod Smith =
, WR DEN - Hatcher's Right Nut Updated 11/20/01 Mike Shanahan said he does =
not know if Smith (ankle) will be sufficiently healed to play in Thursday's=
 game against the Cowboys. "We'll get a chance to evaluate that during the =
week and see," Shanahan told the Denver Post. "If he can help our football =
team, he'll play. If he's in a situation where he can't perform at the leve=
l that we think can help our team, then we'll keep him out and put somebody=
 else in."   Benjamin Gay , RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 The Clevel=
and Plain-Dealer says Butch Davis won't indicate how much Gay will play in =
the near future. "We'll try to get him involved in some of the games," Davi=
s said. "We'll see."   Kevin Lockett , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01=
 Lockett, who suffered a rib injury last weekend against Denver, expects to=
 play on Sunday against Philadelphia. However, the wide receiver has no rea=
l value as a Fantasy player at this point.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Age=
nt Updated 11/20/01 Barring any setbacks, Banks will start Sunday's game ag=
ainst Philadelphia. Banks, who suffered a concussion last weekend vs. Denve=
r, hasn't been feeling any after effects of the injury and should be under =
center for the 'Skins.   Jacquez Green , WR TB - Free Agent Updated 11/20/0=
1 Green (abdomen) is expected to return to practice on Wednesday at full st=
rength. He's been inconsistent this season, and is best used when the match=
up is favorable.   Terrell Owens , WR SF - The Internet Potatoes Updated 11=
/20/01 Owens suffered a sprained left knee and ankle during the overtime se=
ssion of last weekend's game against Carolina. The injuries aren't consider=
ed serious, however, and Owens is expected to be in the starting lineup on =
