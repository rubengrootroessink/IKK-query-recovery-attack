----------------------------------------------------------

JOHN JARES RETURNS TO FOUNDERS

On November 13, 2001, the Dreyfus Founders Funds submitted several mutual
fund filings with the SEC.  While this is a common occurrence, what was not
so common was the statement at the bottom that read, "Thomas M. Arrington
and Scott A. Chapman...are no longer associated with Founders."

This departure could have been quite a blow to Founders; however, to soften
the impact the firm announced that it would be welcoming back a familiar
friend. Now that Arrington and Chapman are moving on, the multitude of funds
that they managed are being handed off to JOHN JARES.   Jares joins the firm
from Delaware Investment Advisors where he served as a portfolio manager for
several of Delaware's funds including the Delaware Balanced Fund.  On his
return to Founders, Jares is receiving quite a warm reception and vote of
confidence as he is handed management responsibility for the Dreyfus
Founders Focus, Dreyfus Founders Growth Fund (with $1.1 billion in equity
assets as of 6/30/2001), the Dreyfus Founders Growth and Income Funds (with
$308.0 million in equity assets as of 6/30/2001), and the domestic portion
of Worldwide Growth Fund (with $154.4 million in equity assets as of
6/30/2001). But then again, Jares and Founders are hardly strangers; from
1994 to 1997, Jares was employed as a portfolio manager at Founders.

The next move for Chapman and Arrington is not known at this time, however
history has shown that the two are likely to stick together for a long time
to come.  Back in December 1998, the duo joined Founders from Highmark
Capital Management, where Arrington served as vice president and director of
income equity strategy and portfolio manager of the Highmark Income Equity
Fund, while Chapman served as vice president and director of Highmark's
growth strategy and managed the Highmark Growth Fund.

-----------------------------------------------------------

BRUCE WASSERSTEIN RESIGNS

BRUCE WASSERSTEIN, the powerful investment banker who recently sold his
company, Wasserstein Perella to securities giant Dresdner AG, has resigned.

Wasserstein was under increasing pressure this week to take control over
Lazard LLC. After the sale of Wasserstein Perella earlier this year,
Wasserstein became increasingly sour about the deal; Dresdner recently
agreed to merge with insurer Allianz AG, effectively squelching the plans
Wasserstein had held for the newly merged firm, Dresdner Kleinwort
Wasserstein Securities LLC.

Wasserstein reportedly had numerous qualms about taking over Lazard, however
after weeks of speculation the move was finally made official on November
15, 2001 as Lazard announced that Bruce Wasserstein would join as Head of
Lazard succeeding Michel David-Weill. In a press release issued by Lazard,
Mr. Wasserstein said, "I am delighted to join Lazard.  We've been discussing
this possibility from time to time for over 15 years.  When I began my own
firm, I aspired for it to become like Lazard.  Lazard has an unmatched
franchise with extraordinarily talented partners.  I look forward to working
with all my new colleagues."

-----------------------------------------------------------

PIONEER COMPLETES INTEGRATION

As of November 1, 2001, Boston-based Pioneer Investment Management Inc., a
unit of UniCredito Italiano in Milan, successfully completed its yearlong
integration process with the parent company's money management arm in
Dublin.  Executives at both locations will report to Giordano Lombardo,
Global Chief Investment Officer.

Under the new system, research analysts are organized into industry sectors
as opposed to being assigned to particular funds.  Marco Pirondini, Head of
Global Equity Research, manages the team of 34 from Boston.  Focused on
fundamental research, the team is divided into seven groups representing
MSCI global sector categories.  Research is now considered a career track at
Pioneer instead of a training ground to become a fund manager, according to
Steve Graziano, president of sales operations.  "A stock analyst is a career
unto itself," Graziano continued.  "It's a profession that's paid equally
lucratively as portfolio management, and you become an expert in an
industry."

Unfortunately, because the reorganization effectively limited her role,
Theresa Hamacher decided to resign as Pioneer's U.S. Chief Investment
Officer effective November 1.  Hamacher's departure had been anticipated
since June, when it was decided that she would report to Mr. Lombardo
instead of to a local chief executive.  Hamacher was not pushed out; Mr.
Graziano said: "Absolutely not.  Theresa decided the role of CIO was not
what it was when she first got here.  It was less important."  In a
statement, Mr. Lombardo commented: "We are disappointed that Theresa has
decided to resign, but respect and understand her decision.  She played a
key role in the development of the investment process of the new Pioneer."
Hamacher joined Pioneer in 1997 from Prudential Mutual Funds to oversee
stock investments.  The next year she became investment chief and was
assigned to shift Pioneer from a star manager model to a team approach.
Hamacher has not said where she plans to work next.

Pioneer Global Asset Management S.p.A. and its subsidiaries managed
approximately $93 billion as of September 30, 2001 under the name Pioneer
Investments.

BOICH FORMS AVERA GLOBAL PARTNERS

Avera Global Partners, L.P. is a new San Francisco-based hedge fund company
founded this year by JOHN D. BOICH, a former principal and senior portfolio
manager of global equities at Montgomery Asset Management, L.P. Prior to his
departure from Montgomery Asset Management, Boich co-managed the Montgomery
Global Long-Short Fund, the Montgomery Global 20 Fund and the Montgomery
Global Opportunities Fund.  His new venture specializes in alternative
investments and provides investment advisory services for a variety of
vehicles including onshore, offshore and separate accounts.  The main
product of this firm is a global long-short equity fund.

Among those who joined Boich at Avera Global Partners, L.P. are:

-J. PHILLIP OELZE, JR., CFA, President and Chief Operating Officer.  A
former vice president, regional investment manager at Wells Fargo Bank
Arizona N.A., Oelze brings along with him 15 years of operational management
experience.  At Wells Fargo, Oelze directed all operational aspects.

-SCOTT F. KLIMO, CFA, Senior Fundamental Analyst.  Klimo formerly served as
a senior international analyst at Founders Asset Management focusing on
large-cap growth issues.  He has had experience covering continental Europe,
Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Southeast Asia, and Latin America.

-ERIK RENANDER, CFA, Senior Fundamental Analyst.  Like Boich, Renander was
formerly with Montgomery Asset Management, L.P.  He was as an analyst on the
global research team.

-JOSEPHINE CHU, CFA, Senior Quantitative Analyst.  Chu formerly served as a
portfolio manager at Barclays Global Investors where she managed the MSCI
EAFE International Equities Index Funds.  Prior to that, Chu was a portfolio
manager in the quantitative products group at Scudder Kemper Investments,
where she developed and enhanced quantitative models.

-MARK KRESS, CFA, Senior Quantitative Analyst.  Kress formerly served as an
analyst at Trinity Equity Management, where he developed and implemented
quantitative financial screening models and risk management procedures, in
addition to equity valuation models to identify long and short investment
candidates.

-ROBIN UDANY, Senior Trader.  Uday joins the firm from The Cypress Funds,
where she handled the day-to-day trading activities.  Prior to The Cypress
Funds, she created and developed Nomura Securities' Dow Jones Index
Arbitrage desk.  She has also worked as a fixed-income futures and options
specialist and an energy futures and options trader.

-SHADI ABOUKHATER, Senior Trader.  AbouKhater joins Avera from Hilspen
Capital Management where he executed the majority of trades, handling trade
breaks, reconciliation, performance tracking and maintenance of client
accounts.


The firm relies on the belief that relative earnings momentum is what drives
absolute as well as relative stock price performance.  The foundation of the
firm's investment philosophy is built upon the idea that companies with
improving earnings momentum trading at a discount to their region and sector
will outperform, while companies with deteriorating earnings momentum
trading at a premium to their region and sector will under perform.

The firm utilizes both quantitative and qualitative techniques in
identifying long and short candidates from an initial universe of the 2000
largest publicly traded companies globally (excluding emerging markets).

Avera Global Partners uses relative earnings momentum metrics and a
quantitative ranking system built primarily around valuation metrics to
scale down their investment universe.  Fundamental analysis is conducted at
the company and sector level, and modeling tools are used to identify trends
and inflection points in earnings momentum.

As the forecast horizon rarely exceeds six months, the firm tends to focus
on near-term earnings trends.  At the sector level, analysts monitor sector
specific data series such as order trends and inventory levels.  After the
investment universe is narrowed down to a short list of long and short
candidates, the firm employs portfolio optimization technology to help
identify the long and short candidates for the final portfolio.

GALLEON REPORTS SANS KRISHEN SUD

For the third quarter ended September 31, 2001, New York-based Galleon
Management L.P. reported ownership of 179 companies, valued at $656.4
million, a decline from the previous quarter when the firm reported
ownership of 177 companies, valued at $1.1 billion.

The most probable reason for the decline is the recent departure of former
Galleon healthcare star KRISHEN SUD.  Galleon and Sud recently had a falling
out, following Sud's departure to form healthcare oriented hedge fund Argus
Partners.   In the beginning of June 2001, Sud left the firm with three
other healthcare analysts after failing to get full control of the
healthcare fund. His intentions to leave the firm, however, were not made
known to Galleon's other partners until the day he actually left.  According
to Dow Jones Newswires, "in a letter to shareholders dated October 4th, Sud
acknowledged making 'several mistakes' in exiting Galleon." SAM NAVARRO, who
was added to Galleon earlier this year, has since taken over healthcare
responsibilities at Galleon.

Galleon, run by RAJ RAJARATNAM, has traditionally focused on the technology
and healthcare sectors.  Most recently, the firm's investments were
concentrated in technology (72.6%), healthcare (15.8%), and communication
services (4.6%).  Since its previous filing, Galleon reported net inflows
into the technology and communication services sector, and a net reduction
in its holdings in healthcare, financials, and consumer staples.

Top five holdings for the third quarter ended September 31, 2001 included:
Cisco Systems Inc. [CSCO] with 3,871,188 shares (valued at $47.2 million);
Microsoft Corp. [MSFT] with 750,000 shares (valued at $38.4 million); Texas
Instruments Inc. [TXN] with 1,400,000 shares (valued at $35.0 million);
Solectron Corp. [SLR] with 2,892,500 shares (valued at $33.7 million); and,
Nvida Corp. [NVDA] with 917,000 shares (valued at $25.2 million).

The firm's top new positions included the firm's purchase of Nvidia.
Rounding out the firm's top five included Semiconductor Holders Trust (Dep
Rcpt) [SMH] with 539,500 shares (valued at $14.8 million); Dell Computer
Corp. [DELL] with 724,600 shares (valued at $13.4 million); and, Qualcomm
Inc. [QCOM] with 261,200 shares (valued at $12.4 million).
