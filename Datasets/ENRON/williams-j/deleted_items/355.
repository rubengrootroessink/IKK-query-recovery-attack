Investment ideas
-----------------------------------------


1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Beware the ghosts of Christmas 2001
Spirits are hanging over the markets, not all of
which promise happy returns.

By Rick Wayman, CFA

The market will face some difficult challenges during the next two
quarters, and investors need to be aware of these issues in order to
invest wisely. So, in the spirit of the coming season, and with
apologies to Charles Dickens, I would like to introduce you to
these challenges as the ghosts of Christmas--Version 2001.

Our main theme is that the economy is not as good as the market
currently thinks it is, and that earnings will come under increased
pressure by issues that have not yet appeared on the Streets radar.
The combination of these forces could depress stocks near-term,
but could also result in a classic January rally.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Value without tears
Those who follow our value-oriented screens know that
value investors don't just wind up buying dogs.

By Marc Gerstein

All investors risk getting involved with dogs every day. But value
investors need to be especially sensitive to the matter, since they
make a regular practice of searching for stocks that look attractive
based on some simple arithmetic that any investor can do, and on
answers that anyone can see. If you're searching for value, you
almost have to presume that anything you uncover is a dog until
you receive specific evidence showing otherwise.
