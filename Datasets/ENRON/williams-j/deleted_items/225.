 2. SparkNews

 Haven't you always wished that tales of starvation, war, depression,
 and murder could be even funnier? Wish no longer.

 We get the news directly from the wire, then BURN-ify, JESUS-ify,
 and BONE-ify it for your reading pleasure.

 There are NEW reports every single day, covering all the
 major events.

 Recent Headlines...
 -Mine, Bombs Jack-Up 2 In God-damn South Lebanon. Like I Care.

 3. TheSpark's New Look

 To keep warm during the cold & lonely winter, we re-designed
 the site. It's easier to navigate, and it looks way better.

 Everyone loves it. I'm sure you will, too.

 Spark Pride: Catch it!

 4. When Is There Gonna Be a FAT PROJECT UPDATE?
 -----------------------------------------------
 We talked to Nicole and Eric just last week, and as soon as
 those guys get off their (fat?) asses and send us a couple
 photos, there'll be a new post. Should be in a couple weeks.

 Confirmed fact: Eric's fiancee is no longer with him.
 Unconfirmed fact: One of his nuts is fake.
