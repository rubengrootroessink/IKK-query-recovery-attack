Yo Dr. Ake -

I WENT AND GOT MEASURED LAST NIGHT, HOLMES!!!!  I am The Man.  Hey, speaking 
of your wedding, can you send me the information on the hotels near by?  I 
never got the wedding invite, so I don't have the details on that stuff.  I 
guess I need to get hooked up with a room pretty soon, huh?

As for this weekend, sorry but

Jay,

Hey guess what:  GET MEASURED FOR YOUR TUX YOU DUMBASS!!!!!!!!!

Okay, now that we got that taken care of, what are you doing this weekend?  I 
would ask you to join me for some fun in big D, but I know your standard 
response to that .  Instead, a couple of my compadres have decided to take me 
to Shreveport for a good ol "whiskey tango" (read white trash) partying.  I 
imagine there'll be a little drinkin, a little gamblin, and possibly a little 
of nekidness.  Let me know if you are interested.
