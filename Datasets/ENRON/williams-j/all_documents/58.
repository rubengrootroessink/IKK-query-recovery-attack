Hello,

Per my conversation with Doug, I would like to confirm the following credit 
approvals.

-  Cross Timbers Energy Services, Inc  has been rejected by credit, but has 
been approved for "view" access only.  

-  Tenaska Marketing Ventures has been approved by credit.

Please reply to confirm, and I will process accordingly.

Thank you,
Andrea
