"Tentatively approved" means that we should assume that Tenaska will be 
granted full approval unless we hear otherwise from Debbie, Bill, or Jason 
Williams by COB Thursday.  

Please mail the letter and UserID out to Tenaska today.   I have set up the 
counterparty in CL system with appropriate interest rates and privileges, and 
you guys in PCG should set up the user as usual in the CL system.  

I really appreciate everyone's speed on this issue;  I believe that there is 
a good chance Tenaska will want to transact on Friday.  I told them the 
earliest they would be able to do so was Friday, pending our usual setup 
processes and credit check.

thanks again!

Debbie - 

Does 'tentatively approved' mean that we should not grant Tenaska access 
until we hear from you tomorrow?

Hello,

Per my conversation with Doug, I would like to confirm the following credit 
approvals.

been approved for "view" access only.  

-  Tenaska Marketing Ventures has been approved by credit.

Please reply to confirm, and I will process accordingly.

Thank you,
