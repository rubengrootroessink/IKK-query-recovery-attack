Sounds like you should deny them from Commodity Logic.  Please let them 
Commodity Logic team know.

Bill -

Southwest Royalties' credit quality is extremely poor:  E-rating of 11, 
negative equity, very little liquidity and no bank lines available to them.  
We currently have 5 trades on the books with them (all financial) with a 
total net position ~$2.6 MM out of the money to Enron.

I would normally not move up the payment for this counterparty, but all of 
our trading with them has been limited to selling them financial puts.  As 
such, Enron will not incur any exposure to Southwest Royalties, and I feel 
that an earlier pay date can be justified from a credit standpoint.

Please let me know if you have any questions.


Jay

Jay,

Please review Southwest Royalties for our comfort with paying them earlier in 
the billing cycle.  Please keep in mind that our payable can be used as an 
offset against any MTM exposure.

Let me know.  Thanks,
Bill
