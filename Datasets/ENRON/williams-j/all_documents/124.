Jason

Devon Energy also has appx. [$12MM to $15MM] of monthly exposure to EOTT 
Energy Operating, LP.

We are requesting the ability to "carve out" $30MM (2 months sales) from the 
existing Enron Guaranty to cover any exposure that we have with EOTT.

We could document this a letter agreement attached to the current guaranty. 

Please advise
