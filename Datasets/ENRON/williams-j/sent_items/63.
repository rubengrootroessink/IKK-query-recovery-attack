Bryan,

	We have a Web based application that access the oracle tns peoplesdev.  I receive the error ORACLE not available.
I'm trying to find out who maintains the db where this, and it's production version lives to see if we can resolve the issue.  Any
help you can provide is greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Dave Dronet
