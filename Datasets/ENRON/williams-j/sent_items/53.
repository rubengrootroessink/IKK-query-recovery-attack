Jason
I had to stop Boardwalk doing a financial deal today for Nov 01 - March 02.  The volume for that period is small 150,000 GJ in total but the customer is very unsophisticated.  We need to put a summary of the applicable credit provisions (as previously discussed) and contract in front of them.  As this deal is short term in nature and only in Canadian Dollars we have decided to use the Short Form Master Financial Trading Agreement.  Jason can you please help us get this done.  We initiated the process at our end on April 5.
Many thanks
Kate
