At the request of our credit department, attached are preliminary drafts of a Master Netting, Setoff and Security Agreement and the Collateral Annex to such document.  These documents are being sent still with some missing information in the interest expediting your initial analysis while we gather all the information.  

From now on I should be your legal contact at Enron to discuss and finalize these documents.

Thanks
