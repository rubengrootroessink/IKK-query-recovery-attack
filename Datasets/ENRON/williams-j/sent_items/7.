Thanks for your help on all my stuff.  Everything should be set up just like April 11.  Its in the system as Max SIQ for both companies, and the 10301 DIQ for Peoples only, No DIQ for NS.  This could change slightly in the morning, but my guess is it won't.  I already balanced out Will Co and Other City gates and took 72000 to Peoples.  Kelly needs to buy at least the short at amarillo.  Thanks again and I'll check with you in the morning to make sure everything is ok.  I'll have my pager if there is a major crisis, I dont anticipate one though.
