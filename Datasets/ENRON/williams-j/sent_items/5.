Lisa - here are the deal I was telling you about.

Jay - I tried pulling the confirms up on both of these deals this morning in DCAF, and I get a message saying there was no confirm.  The notes to both deals state that you are working on the confirm.  Have these deals been confirmed yet?  Also, if they have, can you get me a copy?  If they could be faxed to 713-646-8420 it would be great.

I addition, on a regular basis, Lisa Valderrama and Pam Boxx need to be copied on any Emails like this.  That way if one of us is out of the office, the others will be able to make sure the invoice/payments take place on time.  

If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks.

Bryce -

Per our telephone conversation this morning, following are details on my two deals that need to be invoiced on revised schedules:


WEIRTON STEEL CORPORATION, deal QZ2383

This is a physical gas deal, running from 4/1/01 through 3/31/02.  I would like to have this invoiced on a 15-day cycle, where counterparty payment is due on the 1st of each month and the 15th of each month.  Sitara # is 693548.  We need to send them an invoice IMMEDIATELY for the first 15 days of April.

This is also a physical gas, running from 4/1/01 through 6/30/01.  I want to have this invoiced on a 30-day cycle, where counterparty payment in due on May 1, June 1, and August 1.  Sitara # is 689632.
