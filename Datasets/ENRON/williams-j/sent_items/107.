Joannie-

	How's it going?!  Can't remember if we've spoken since I joined
FYI-Net, but I'm part of a local multimedia and software development firm.
Many groups within Enron have used and continue to use our services.

	We have a service that we provide to EnronOnline that may interest
Investor Relations.  From time-to-time, EOL sends us a Powerpoint
presentation, a headshot of a VP, an audio file and written cues.  We
synchronize the presentation and audio, then make it available online from
the EnronOnline website.  Users don't know that they've left the EOL Web
site, we can provide the service inexpensively and we can provide a
standard, 48-hour turnaround on presentations.  Here's what the final
product looks like for EOL:

 <<...OLE_Obj...>>

	We call the product "SlideStreamer," and we can present video as
well as audio - up to you.  We currently have four customers of this service
and have the system down to a routine.

	I realize that today is probably not the best time to discuss this
service, but if you are interested in the product, I would welcome the
opportunity to tell you and the IR group all about it.  You may call me at
(713) 892-8394 or reply to this message to get in touch with me.

Thanks and regards,

David M. Mims
