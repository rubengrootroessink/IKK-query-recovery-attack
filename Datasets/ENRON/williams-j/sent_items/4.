Hi Jason, Brant,

I understand that you have been looking at Ormet Corp, and at Ormet Primary Aluminium Corp. The metals originators are thinking of a potential transaction with Ormet Corp and are asking us for information that we may have available on the companies.

Do you have any financial information on these companies? Which kind of transactions are we involved in with them?

I appreciate if you let me know

Thanks

Diana
