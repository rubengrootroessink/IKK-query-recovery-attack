About Company Sleuth
--------------------
"?Company Sleuth electronically tracks companies of your choosing on what's called the Stakeout List. The Stakeout List includes some obscurities such as domain name registrations and patents as well as more run-of-the-mill information such as insider trades, news, and broker reports. The number of message board postings on a stock is displayed in a chart, indicating whether the buzz is heating up or petering out. You don't even need to visit the site regularly-Company Sleuth will e-mail the results so you can pick and choose what to read."
