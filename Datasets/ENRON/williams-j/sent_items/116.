Jason,
I know that you have  been very busy, so hopefully this will help your workload.  I have a  proposed crosscompany netout agreement that hopefully is brief enough that it  will hopefully expedite the process of getting through our mutual legal  hurdles.
Let me know if this  works for you.
Thanks &  hope you have a good weekend!
