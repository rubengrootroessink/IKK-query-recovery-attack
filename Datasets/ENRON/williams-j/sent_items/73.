Hey Buddy,

d I kept putting it off.  Sorry about that, I will get better at writing ba=
ck. So what is up man?  How has the sea been treating you? So what have you=
 been doing, and what have you seen?  Around here the same ole stuff is goi=
n on. Work, Golf and hanging out.  Thats about it.  Ferg got his new Yelliw=
 Lab at the end of April. He named him Walter.  He's a pretty good lookin d=
og, but he has been cutting in to their sleep time.  Chris and Sarah had to=
 start wearing ear plugs at night because the dog kept whining.  I thought =
that was pretty hilarious. Well, I finally got promoted.  I am now a full t=
ime trader. Its pretty cool, but ot can be real stressful. I'm still pretty=
 much doing what I was before, but now I have to take full responsibility i=
n all profits and losses.  So far its been goin Okay, but the days when you=
 have on the wrong positions it can really suck.  Joanna's brother graduate=
d last week from Galveston A&M.  He already got a job and started Wednesday=
 for a shipping broker.  He is staying with us until July 1 then he is goin=
g to Paris to train for 3 months.  That should be pretty cool!  Jo is still=
 traveling alot. She went to Toronto, Miami, London, and she is going to Be=
rlin in June.  Wer might be going to Italy in September for our anniversary=
.  She is going for work and I might try to tag along. The weather has  bee=
n pretty good around here lately, all the Golf course are in great shape.  =
I shot a 77 the other day at FT. Bend - 41-36.  Pretty inconsistent, but I'=
ll take it.  I bogied 18 to miss shotting 1 under.  How's Cass doing. I kee=
p meaning to call her, but I haven't yet.  We miss seeing you guys and look=
 forward to kicking back and drinking some beer and listening to all your s=
tories.  I hope all is well and lookin forward to seeing you soon.  Keep ou=
r country safe, we're counting on you.  "You and your faggoty white uniform=
