Market Participants:

As of trade date 2/12/01 the ISO began publishing estimated Daily cost
associated with Incremental Imbalance energy on the CAISO Webster
http://www.caiso.com/marketops/OASIS/pubmkt2.html under button #46 Imbalance
Energy Costs.  This information is presented as follows:
1. As-Bid:  Energy purchased via BEEP but with bids above the soft-cap
of $150.
2. Daily MCP:  Energy purchased via BEEP at or below soft cap that will
settle at MCP.
3. Out-of-Market:  Energy purchased out-of-market.

This Market data is available at 1800 hours on the day following the
applicable trade date.
The ISO did receive requests for hourly breakdown of these values.   At this
point, we have only received approval to publish Daily Averages.
The ISO has also posted historical data file for this same energy purchase
data for the period Nov 1, 2000 through Feb 11, 2001.  This historical data
is available in the Exceptions Log under real time data
http://www.caiso.com/marketops/OASIS/exceptions/.
