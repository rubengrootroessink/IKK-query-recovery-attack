Robin & Jeff:

Mary Hain asked that I advise you she had one change to the information she 
gave you yesterday.  

Instead of saying, "It doesn't mean the FERC hasn't set a rate..."
you should say, "It doesn't mean the FERC has accepted a rate and that a rate 
isn't on file".

If you have any questions about this, you can contact Mary on her cell phone 
(503/807-0928) AFTER 12:45pm Cnetral Time.

Lysa Akin
Ass't to Mary Hain
