OK.  I'll see you Friday.  I will bring some sort of salad ... probably 
pasta, unless you need some other kinds of dishes, like a dessert or 
appetizer.

Come after work.

What would you like to bring?

Directions from the Junction of Interstate 5 and Rt. 217:

Take Kruse Way ( Rt. 217 ) east from I-5.
(towards Lake Oswego until Kruse Way ends at L. Boones Ferry Rd)
Turn right onto Lower Boones Ferry Rd.
(follow sign for Lake Grove Dist. / Tualatin ).
Go straight less than 
 mile to the 3rd light at Bryant Rd. and Firwood.
(Bryant Rd. is on the left, Firwood is on the right)
(Albertsons and a Texaco are on the right, 2 banks on the left)
Turn left onto Bryant Rd.
Go straight to the 2nd stop sign.
(at Lakeview after crossing the R.R. tracks right before the 7 Eleven)
Turn left onto Lakeview.
Go straight to the first stop sign.
(at South Shore Blvd.)
Turn right onto South Shore Blvd.
Go "straight" - South Shore winds around a lot - a little over 
 mile to 
Cedar Rd. on the right.
(if you get to a stop sign - at Westview - you've gone too far)
The order of streets - on the right only - coming up to Cedar are: Canal, 
Kelok, and Cedar.
Turn right onto Cedar Rd. to: 17110 Cedar Rd.
Our house is the second paved driveway on the left. (about 50 feet from S. 
Shore Blvd.)

I'd love to come on Friday. Just let me know what time and I will probably
need directions again. Was hoping I'd have a chance to say goodbye ...
other than some RTO meeting. Any particular kind of food you'd like me to
bring?

I know, just when I was starting to get a little better at it. I'm having
a potluck at my house Friday night if you'd like to come.

Wow! Congratulations! I guess that means no more jam sessions for us. :-(
Hopefully you'll find some good music and open mics in your new town. Best
of luck.
