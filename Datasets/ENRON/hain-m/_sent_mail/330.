Subject: San Diego County Profit Chart


Nancy,
 We have received two charts attached to the November 9, 2000
prepared statement of Diane Jacob, a San Diego Supervisor, which shows
retail prices per KWH for 1999 and 2000.  In the transcript she refers to
another chart -- one that supposedly shows "outrageously excessive profits
by traders."  It would appear that we have the wrong chart.  The missing
chart is also the one referred to in Chairman Hoecker's questions to Enron.
Could you try again to locate this profit chart and get it to us as soon as
possible.  We need it to evaluate the proposed responses.

Thanks
Gary
