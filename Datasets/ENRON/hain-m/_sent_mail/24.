For purposes of this Request, "disclose and/or produce" has the meanings 
described below. With respect to oral communications, "disclose and/or 
produce" means to describe the time, date, approximate duration, and 
substantive content of the communication; the identity and organizational 
affiliation of the communicating individuals; whether the communication 
occurred in person or by telephone; the location of the communication if in 
person; the identity of any witnesses to the communications, including all 
individuals in the room if the communication occurred by speakerphone; and 
whether the communication was made in the presence of or after coordination

Request, you need not "disclose and/or produce" oral communications that 
occurred during meetings noticed in compliance with Rate Case Rule 1010.7(d).

 With respect to written communications, the Request includes communications 
in any recorded form, whether on paper, electronic (including, without 
limitation, e-mails), or whatever form. For such communications, "disclose

response_text:  The Public Power Council (PPC) objects to this Data Request 
on the grounds that it (i) seeks information that is not relevant; (ii) seeks 
information that is privileged; and (iii) seeks information that is unduly 
burdensome to produce. Rules of Procedure Governing Rate Hearings, Section 
1010.8(b). PPC further objects to this Data Request on the grounds that it is 
in improper form as it does not cite to specific testimony or indicate the 
specific use to which the information sought will be put. Special Rules of 
Practice, WP-02-01. Without waiving the foregoing objections, PPC responds as 
follows:
