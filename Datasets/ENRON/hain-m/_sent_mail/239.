Christi - Cara has E-mailed a number of questions to Linda and Kelley.  If 
she doesn't hear from them by tomorrow morning, can Cara and I have a 
conference call with you at 11:00 a.m. Pacific time so you can birddog people 
and get some answers?  In the meantime, if Cara E-mailed you the questions, 
would you answer any you know the answers to. Thanks.

I have gotten these documents from Tim, Val, and now you.  I have tried to 
get in touch with Linda Lawrence and Kelly Hutley, no answer from either of 
them.  I don't understand what I am looking at, and am not even really sure 
what I am supposed to do with it, aside from giving it my blessing.

Until I get a response, I can't give my 'blessing'

Did Tim already send you these documents for your review?  If he did, have 
you been working with the Houston group on them or do you want to tell me 
about any problems?

There was no Mexico activity for the Fourth Quarter of 2000.
Please let me know if you all have any questions or comments regarding any of 
the reports.
Thank you
