Did Tim already send you these documents for your review?  If he did, have 
you been working with the Houston group on them or do you want to tell me 
about any problems?

There was no Mexico activity for the Fourth Quarter of 2000.
Please let me know if you all have any questions or comments regarding any of 
the reports.
Thank you
