Typically the traders are not interested in changes to the TAC because it i=

Roger,

I did a brief summary of this last week which I will copy below.

I do not have any sense of whether the proposed change will be accepted,=20
accepted subject to refund, or suspended by FERC.

If you need any detail, I think you will find it in one of the ISO's=20
attachments to their filing (the .xls file) which is at www.caiso.com/ferc=
=20
filings.

Cheers,

Alan Comnes

Summary of ISO Amendment 34:

Filed: December 28

Effective Date: 1/1/01 (expedited treatment requested)

Protests Due: January 17? (need to confirm this)

Filing in a Nutshell: The ISO states that the purpose of the amendment is t=
o=20
clarify certain issues associated with implementation of the new transmissi=
on=20
Access Charge methodology it orginally proposed in Amendment No. 27.=20
(According to the ISO, Amendment 27 has been accepted for filing, suspended=
,=20
and set for hearing.  Settlement negotiations are ongoing.  (Is Enron a par=
ty=20
to these settlements?)) In addition, the ISO provides new transmission Acce=

Charge (TAC) rates that will be in effect if the Commission approves the Ci=

Tariff.

Specific Proposed Changes

Clarification of Wheeling Access Charge Quantity

The ISO proposes that these provisions be clarified to specify that in the=
=20
determination of the Wheeling Access Charge, the proper calculation is to u=
se=20
transmission facility ownership and Entitlements less all Encumbrances. =20
Encumbrances include transmission used to meet demands of existing=20
contracts.  This is how the ISO is currently calculating this charge and th=
e=20
ISO appears to be using this filing to codify this method.

New HV TAC Rates Using Year-1 of the ISO=01,s Proposed Transmission Methodo=
logy

The current Access Charge methodology consists of three separate zone rates=
=20
based on the Transmission Revenue Requirement of the Original Participating=
=20
TO.  Because each zone corresponds to the service territory of the TO, they=
=20
are known as =01&license plate=018 rates.  Under Amendment No. 27, this met=
hodology=20
continues in effect until a New Participating TO joins the ISO.  Once that=
=20
occurs, the Access Charge for High Voltage Transmission Facilities will be=
=20
assessed based on the combined High Voltage Transmission Revenue Requiremen=
ts=20
of all the Participating TOs in each TAC Area.

The filing claims to implement an already-approved transition formula where=
in=20
new members of the ISO will pay a rate that is a mix license place and syst=
em=20
average embedded costs.  The goal is that after 10 years there will be only=
 1=20
high voltage access charge. The following table shows that under the curren=
t=20
method, which would be a 90/10 split of license-plate/system-average charge=
s,=20
PG&E and SCE TO access charges would rise approximately $3.2 million and=20
Vernon would be subsidized approximately $7 million.

Vernon=01,s Existing Transmission Rights Converted to FTRs

Veron, by joining the ISO effective 1/1/01, agrees to convert existing=20
transmission rights to FTRs of presumably an equivalent amount.  The propos=
ed=20
FTRs to allocate to Vernon are in the filing.  These FTRs will expire when=

the underlying contract right expires or 10 years, whichever is sooner.

Can you get us what the estimated revenue requirement cost shifting will be=

to SCE, PG&E, and SDG&E?  I know it is not much, but we need to build this=

Addition of City of Vernon as PTO


Market Participants:
As of January 1, 2001, the City of Vernon has joined the CAISO as a
Participating Transmission Owner (PTO) under the CAISO Tariff and
Transmission Control Agreement (TCA).

According to Amendment 27 of the ISO Tariff, there are three TAC areas:
Northern TAC Area, Eastern/Central TAC Area, and Southern TAC Area.

The following TAC Area rates for the use of the High Voltage Transmission
Facilities are in effect starting January 1, 2001.


TAC Area High Voltage Access Charge
(TAC Area + ISO-wide)

North 1.41 $/MWH
East/Central 2.04 $/MWH
South 1.99 $/MWH

The Low Voltage Access Charge is defined in each PTO's TO Tariff.
