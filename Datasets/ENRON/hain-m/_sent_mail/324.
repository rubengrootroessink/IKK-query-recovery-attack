Subject: FERC request for gas prices

Bill Howard from FERC just called me.  The Chairman of FERC is asking for the 
following information by the end of the day today:

How much gas did we buy today by basin either: as of the beginning of the day 
or as of midnight?
How much of the gas went into California?
What was the average price or the high and low price?

I asked him to if FERC wa asking other market participants.  He said more and 
more every day and they would continue this until prices started going down.  
I asked him if the Commission intended to keep this information 
confidential.  He said he didn't know.  Christi - could you work with Phillip 
on this?  Bill's number is (202) 208-1268.
