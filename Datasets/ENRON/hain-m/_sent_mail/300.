I agree with Sue.  In fact, I don't even think we need to intervene given 
that the ISO did not file a tariff that would become effective.  So unless 
Tim wants to help out the ISO with a supportive filing . . . .

I think we might want to make a neutral or supportive intervention -- because 
we can expect the Hogan forces to come blaring in and we may need to do 
something then.  Especially since my understanding is that the report is 
pretty suppportive of our views.
