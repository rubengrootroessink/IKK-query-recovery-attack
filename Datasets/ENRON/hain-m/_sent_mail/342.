Hi Folks!  For 3rd quarter we'll need to undergo an examination of our 
reporting requirements for WSPP and accordingly, our reporting processes.  
The filing requirements can be found under the " WSPP Library" heading of the 
Current Documents section of the WSPP home page (www.wspp.org).

Basically, we just need to be confident our reports are accurate and we also 
need to be cognizant that if we make significant changes, we should be able 
to anticipate the impact of those changes and send appropriate adjusting 
notification if necessary.  Let's not surprise ourselves or FERC in a big way!

I'm not sure that I am the appropriate staff to head this up, but will be 
happy to provide organization and coordination to the effort until we all are 
happy with the undertaking.

Next week after the close of this month is complete, I will structure a 
project management file on the WSPP reporting and we'll take it from there.  
Please contact me with comments, questions, complaints, x7756.

P.S.
We have filed the 2nd quarter report using the unchanged method.
