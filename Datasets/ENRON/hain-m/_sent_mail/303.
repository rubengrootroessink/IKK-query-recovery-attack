The following are  some  notes and questions regarding FERC's December 15=
=20
Order intended to supplement Mary's notes distributed over the weekend.

1. Penalty on Underscheduled Load=20

a. Penalty threshold

The FERC stood by its Nov 1 recommendation to impose a penalty on all SC's=
=20
that underschedule by more than 5%.  The only change relative to November 1=
=20
is that the FERC will allow SC's with loads 200 MW or less to have up to 10=
=20
MW imbalance without penalty.  EPMI as a power marketer, has a highly=20
variable load, I assume.  Do we need to seek clarification from FERC or ISO=
=20
on how ISO will measure the load (annual average, annual peak, monthly peak=
?)=20
used to determine whether the applicable penalty threshold  is 10 MW or 5%?=
 =20
Guidance from traders would be appreciated.

b. Estimated bills
FERC allows the ISO to implement a blended "automated/manual" process to=20
implement the ISO's load imbalance penalty.  To simplify the settlement=20
process, the ISO is allowed to institute estimated billing procedures on a=
=20
temporary basis.  Does EPMI have a serious problem with being billed on an=
=20
estimated basis?

2. Documenting Incremental Seller Costs, Including Opportunity Costs

The FERC order raises important issues with regard to documenting our costs=
,=20
which will be required on all sales to the ISO or PX effective on 1/1/01.  =
In=20
its discussion of the $150/MWh breakpoint, FERC states: "In recognition of=
=20
the unworkable complexities that the opportunity cost concept introduces in=
=20
the ISO real-time imbalance market, we will eliminate it."  Enron will=20
undoubtedly raise the impermissibility of opportunity costs in its rehearin=
g=20
request.  Among other things, EPMI will  argue that opportunity costs are a=
=20
legitimate economic cost, that such costs are used in transmission pricing,=
=20
and that without such costs the FERC is essentially taking=20
generator/marketers back to cost-of-service ratemaking

This being said, EPMI must operate without the benefit of using opportunity=
=20
costs as a basis for documenting above-$150/MWh accepted bids effective=20
1/1/01.

As noted in the list of information that must be reported by Enron (see=20
Mary's summary or p. 59 of the FERC order), sellers that have not generated=
=20
their own power can report "purchase price".  Is West Trading prepared to=
=20
document every above-$150/MWh sale to the ISO or PX with an associated=20
"purchase price?"  In addition, other costs that clearly apply to a=20
marketer--such as transmission access costs, transmission losses, expected=
=20
replacement power costs, start-up/no-load costs--are not allowed on the=20
list.  (We should not the omission of these costs in our petition for=20
rehearing.)

In several places in the order, the Commission states that sellers should b=
e=20
allowed to earn reasonable profits but little guidance is given.  The only=
=20
concrete guidance I found was in Massey's concurring opinion which identifi=
ed=20
$25/MWh as a "reasonable capacity adder."

Accepted bids below $150/MWh do not require documentation.  The preliminary=
=20
opinion from our discussion today was that such bids are in a =01&safe harb=
or=018=20
zone and it appears that refund risk on such transactions is much less.
