You asked me to know about any ISO Board activities.  Sue left me a voice 
mail saying she went to the last Board meeting and they didn't do much.  
There will be another meeting February 1 9:00-6:00, although Sue's not sure 
she'll be going.  According to the web the agenda is as follows:

GENERAL SESSION 9:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m.
1) Public Comment
2) Overview of ISO Financial, Legal & Regulatory Activities
3) Review of Administrative Procedures & Responsibilities of the Board
4) How the Transmission System Works
5) Review of Current Issues Facing California and the ISO
6) Functions of the ISO
7) Review of California Markets & ISO's Responsibilities

EXECUTIVE SESSION 5:00 p.m. - 6:00 p.m.
1) Discussion of Legal Issues Concerning Impending Market Activity
2) Review of Compensation Goals for 2000
3) Review of Current Investigations of the ISO

I did not see any motions or papers that are posted for consideration at this 
time.  To review General Session 
agenda documents as they appear online go to:
