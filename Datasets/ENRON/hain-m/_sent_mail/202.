Linda:  Mary Hain and Tim Beldon have been working with Oregon PUC 
Commissioner Ronnie Euchas on electricity information disclosure.    From 
yesterday's hearing, there was some consensus to include legislative language 
in the energy bill to address transparancy issues.  As you know, Senator 
Wyden and Steve Kean had a positive exchange on this issue during the hearing 
due to the questions we had drafted.  I can work on the bipartisanship issue 
and gain support for federal bill inclusion from Murkowski, but we need a 
state federal nexis on drafting the legislative language to assure it meets 
both the federal and state needs.  please advise.  many thanks.

Cynthia,

Thanks for getting me the Q&As for the hearing.  Senator Wyden is interested 
in
following up on the issue of electricity information disclosure and would like
to work with Enron on this.  I would appreciate any input you could provide on
how best to go about this through legislation, what sort of information should
be disclosed, to whom and when, whether financial information as well as
operating information should be included, and any suggestions for a Republican
on the Committee who you think would be good for Senator Wyden to work with on
legislation.

Thanks again for your help and I look forward to working with you further on
this.

- Joshua
