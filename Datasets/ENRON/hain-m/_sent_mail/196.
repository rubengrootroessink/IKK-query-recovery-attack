Correct.  I wanted to terminate CTS for EPMI too but others decided this 
issue.  Sorry if there was any confusion.  Please make a filing for Portland 
General, consistent with their letter to the PX.  I am still waiting to hear 
from Enron Wind.

Subject: Notice of PX Termination Filed With FERC


The filing made it (time stamped 5:00; my personal latest).  Thus, we are in 
position to receive a 2/1/01 effective date of the termination.

Although we achieved our primary objective, we will unfortunately need to 
file an "errata" tomorrow to (1) attach the EES and EEMC letters of 
termination, which were received too late to be included in the filing, and 
(2) to correct certain collation glitches (of the attachements) that occurred 
during production.

Query: With regard to EPMI, the filing only terminates its Participation 
Agreement in the PX's core markets (day-ahead and day-of).  It does not 
reference CTS.  Is this correct?

Mary: Based upon our conversation earlier today, I was under the impression 
that PGE had previously terminated its arrangements with the PX, so we agreed 
to delete all references to PGE and not make the filing on its behalf.  
However, after the filing was made, I received a copy of the termination 
letter that PGE sent to the PX today. What is PGE's correct status?  (If we 
need to file for PGE, we should do a separate filing for it tomorrow.  I want 
the errata that we are doing tomorrow for EPMI, EES and EEMC to be treated as 
an "errata" to today's filing, so we cannot add new matters.)
