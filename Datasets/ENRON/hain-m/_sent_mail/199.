We filed with FERC today a final version of this (which I don't yet have).  
We need to discuss Enron Wind doing the same.  Also, you'd need to send a 
letter to the PX terminating your particiaption agreement.  I'll send you the 
letter we sent.  I'm assuming you would want to get out of the CTS market as 
well as the Day-ahead and Day-of.  Call me ASAP 503-464-8862.  Thanks.
