I thought we did not like the government of Desert Star (because it's ruled 
by the publics and the federal government) and did not like other aspects of 
it as much as we liked aspects of RTO West.  Why not wait until we get RTO 
West formed and then argue that the rest should be consolidated into it?  If 
we try to argue that California should join Desert Star it would be sort of 
like the tail wagging the dog and I would be concerned that California would 
try to take over.  Besides with RTO West, we have an organization that at 
least one Federal Power Marketer has said they could join.

Subject: More on the Future of the CAISO


Sue,

I am amending my previous statement about the 2-year delay in creating a
multi-state RTO.  If FERC were to decertify the CAISO and order the CA
utilities to join a regional RTO, I believe that DSTAR, the California
IOUs and the CAISO infrastructure/staff/systems could easily merge and
be up and running as a large Desert Southwest + California RTO before
the end of the year.  This was basically what I had been trying to
achieve last summer when I was facilitating talks between CAISO and
DSTAR parties about merging the two.

Why not lobby for that as the FERC-preferred solution to the state's
illegal takeover of CAISO governance?

Carl
