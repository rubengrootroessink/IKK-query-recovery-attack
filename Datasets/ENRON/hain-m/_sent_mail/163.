I thought you might want to be the Tariff Integration group's liason to the 
Provisions/Requirements Content Group since that group is dealing with 
interconnection issues.  You weren't at the meeting when the assignment came 
up so I said you might be interested in the assignment and that I would take 
responsibility for asking you if you wanted the job.  Are you interested?  I 
don't have your phone number.  I'm at 503-464-8862.
