Tim said you were having a problem using our harvester to get 
companys/entities' ATC that aren't complying with FERC's OASIS requirements.  
Tim suggested that I help you resolve this.  Could you make me a list of 
companies/entities that aren't complying?  Then we could discuss how to 
address the problem with each company/entity.

Tim suggested that, to the extent we want companies to comply, we could call 
them and ask them to comply.  If they don't I suggested we could call the 
FERC hotline on a confidential basis.
