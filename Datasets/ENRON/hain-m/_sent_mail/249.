Subject: More PX Exposure: EEI Event of Default

As if we needed another reason to avoid at all costs a default at the PX:  

I notice that one "Event of Default" under Enron's EEI master agreement is an 
Enron Corp default on indebtedness to third parties, which results in the 
acceleration of obligations in excess of $100 million.  This sounds like our 
doomsday scenario at the PX, under which we default on a payment or 
chargeback, and the PX liquidates our block forward/CTS positions, which the 
PX values in excess of negative $100 million, and then exercises our LCs.  

This makes it even more imperative that we (1) avoid a default at the PX and 
(2) reduce our CTS collateral with the PX.
