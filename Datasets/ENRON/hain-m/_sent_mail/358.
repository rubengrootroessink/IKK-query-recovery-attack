Subject: Public Hydro Data Sources

Mary:

The public data sources that we routinely use for historical, realtime and 
forecast hydroelectric data are:

 http://www.nwd-wc.usace.army.mil This site is operated by the Northwest 
Division of the US Army Corp of Engineers, and includes both historical and 
near-realtime water and power data for all Corp Columbia basin projects, as 
well as major USBR projects and non-federal mid-Columbia plants;

 http://www.nwrfc.noaa.gov This site is operated by the Northwest River 
Forecast Center. It includes both assessments of current Columbia basin 
streamflow conditions and forecasts of future conditions;

 http://www.mp.usbr.gov This is a Bureau of Reclamation site that publishes 
current data and forecasts for California's Central Valley Project (CVP) 
plants;

 http://www.uc.usbr.gov  This is a Bureau of Reclamation site that publishes 
data and forecasts for Colorado River Storage Project (CRSP) plant water 
releases and power production;

 http://h2o.usgs.gov  This is a Geological Survey site that publishes 
near-realtime data from automated streamflow gages, and

 http://www.cbr.washington.edu/dart/ This is a site operated by the 
University of Washington that provides convenient access to historical 
Columbia River and tributary water data.

Of these, the sites most relevant to recent markets are probably the Corp' 
Northwest Division site, which offers enough near-realtime generation data to 
directly account for 75% to 80% of Columbia River energy production, and the 
River Forecast Center, which provides snowpack-driven, long range volume 
runoff forecasts. The CVP data are a helpful index of California hydro 
conditions, but only represent about 10% of the state's installed hydro 
capacity.

Please forward this information to appropriate FERC staff.
