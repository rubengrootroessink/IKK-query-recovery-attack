Actually DSTAR is doing very well.  There is a very business mined 
independent board that is very helpful.  We are getting most everything we 
want in the DSTAR arena.  The only problem with the governance of DSTAR is 
that public power tries to dominate the advisory groups to give a front to 
legitimize its votes giving advice to the board.  The board is very aware of 
this and does its job well.  There was discussion with my SWPTF and the 
southwestern jurisdictional utilities to merge DSTAR and California and the 
effort was going very well until senator peace started some of his antics.  
Anyway, DSTARs a very good process right now.
