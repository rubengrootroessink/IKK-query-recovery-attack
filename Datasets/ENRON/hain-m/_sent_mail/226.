Hi Mary,

Here's the situation as I see it:

DSTAR does indeed still have the bad governance problem to which you
alluded. On the other hand, it's turned out that the independent
Governing Board members have (except in a few cases) been pretty
reasonable and pro-markets.  So on the key issue of governance, what I
think we need to do is get DSTAR filed, and then protest at FERC that
the Advisory Committee is fatally flawed (by definition, it will always
be 10 incumbents vs. 2 non-incumbents, with 2 more
likely-to-side-with-incumbents) - so FERC should order the Bylaws
regarding the Advisory Committee to be changed to something more
equitable - e.g., what we have in RTOWest.

But aside from the governance, there are a lot of good things about
DSTAR (which have resulted from our pushback at the Board since the
fall).  recall that the two key flaws of RTOWest are that (i) FTRs are
all preallocated to incumbents with no obligation to bring them to
market; and (2) RTOWest would not have jurisdiction over all FERC
services and associated facilities.  On both of these issues, we are
much better off in DSTAR.  In DSTAR, FTR auction REVENUES, not FTRs, are
being preallocated - so we've won in DSTAR on this important issue.  And
as to scope of jurisdiction, while the jury is still out (we don't know
what the PTOs are going to do), the counsel to the Board is basically in
agreement with our position.

In most other ways, DSTAR and RTOWest are pretty much the same (the
result of Enron's sponsorship of my work and Tom Delaney's advocacy of
the Enron physical rights model over the years).

There are still a number of important DSTAR issues to be resolved... but
overall, we stand to win on most of them.

So: the advantages of pushing FERC to decertify the CAISO and require
the CA IOUs to join DSTAR (or else lose their market-based rate
authority for themselves and their subsidiaries)are: (1) DSTAR+CA could
be up and running within 12 months; (2) FERC doesn't have to get into
pitched battle with CA over the CAISO governance issues.  It simply gets
rid of the CAISO, and with it, the xenophobic control over the ISO by
the state of California; (3)DSTAR - which plans to file its Tariff in
March/April, becomes a model for RTOWest.
