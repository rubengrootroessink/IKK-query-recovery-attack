Lysa,

My new desk is very narrow but very deep. I think it would be good to have a 
low book shelf up against the back to maximize my ability to store stuff.  
Otherwise, this space is going to drive me nuts.   Can you do some looking 
around the floor or in a catalog?


Mary, would you like something like this too?
