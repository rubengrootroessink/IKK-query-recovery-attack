As I mentioned on the phone, SCE moved FERC (in the FERC docket investigati=
ng=20
the California market) for a subpoena to produce information from the ISO's=
=20
Market Surveillance Committee.  In particular, SCE is requesting informatio=
n=20
that the MSC referenced in its December 4, 2000 report to the FERC, wherein=
=20
it stated that "MSC stands ready to provide the Commission with what we=20
suspect are instances of the exercise of significant market power by specif=
ic=20
market participants.  We encourage not only the Commission, but other law=
=20
enforcement agencies as well, to use their authority to request from these=
=20
market participants the necessary information to confirm whether these=20
suspicions about the exercise of significant market power are in fact=20
correct."  The MSC also stated that it "could provide a number of instances=
=20
of what it suspects are suspicious bidding and scheduling behavior during t=
he=20
summer and Autumn of 2000."

Here's an outline of the positions I think we should make in an answer:

The Commission should reject SoCal Edison's request for a subpoena because=
=20
FERC did not set its investigation for hearing.  Therefore, SCE's request i=
s=20
a collateral attack on the Commission's order establishing the process for=
=20
its investigation in this case.  Further, it would allow Edison to access=
=20
this information to pursue its case against power marketers while denying=
=20
marketers an opportunity to prosecute their cases by denying them an equal=
=20
opportunity to serve discovery upon others (including the UDCs).
In the alternative, the Commission should allow all parties full discovery=
=20
rights and establish an appropriate protective order.
There may also be an argument that, since the MSC has delegated its authori=
ty=20
by FERC, some of the information Edison requested might fall under the=20
deliberative process privilege.  Gary Fergus suggested this argument.  Not=
=20
having done any legal research, I don't know how good of an argument it is.

Are there any other arguments we should make?  Should we have a conference=
=20
call on this?  Jim suggested that we should try to have WPTF file this answ=
er=20
and I agreed.  At first, I was thinking that it would be okay for Ron to=20
draft the answer for WPTF.  However, on further consideration, if we end up=
=20
wanting to argue that another member of WPTF exercised market power,=20
Bracewell would have a conflict of interest that would prohibit it from=20
representing us.  Accordingly, WPTF should use other counsel.

Subject: Questions on Joskow/Kahn

Mary,

Let me know if you think we can really data request SCE on this.  Here are=
=20
some questions that can surely be refined but give you an idea of the holes=
=20
in their study.

Appended to the comments of Southern California Edison Company ("SCE") is a=
=20
study prepared by Paul Joskow and Edward P. Kahn, "A Quantitative Analysis =
of=20
Pricing Behavior In California=01,s Wholesale Electricity Market During Sum=
mer=20
2000," Exhibit A (hereinafter referred to as "Joskow and Kahn Study").  Wit=
h=20
respect to this study:

1) Please provide a complete set of workpapers.  Please provide all models=
=20
used and input assumptions in machine-readable format along with any=20
additional narrative required to explain the results presented in the paper=
s.

2) What is the estimated confidence interval (at 95%) of the competitive=20
benchmark prices (marginal costs) estimated in the study.

3) To the extent not provided in question 1 response, explain in detail=20
assumptions retarding including:

a) Unit ramp-rate constraints;=20

b) Start-up costs including start-up fuel;

c) Minimum-run time costs; and=20

d) Costs of running over noncontiguous awarded hours schedules.=20

4) Provide the precise allocation of hydroelectric generation in GWh=20
allocated to each load decile by month.=20

5) Provide the exact allocation of planned or maintenance in the study.  Wh=
y=20
was not actual outage data used?

6) Provide all other information considered on the elasticity of imports us=
ed=20
in preparing the study other than the value chosen, which is derived=20
=01&loosely=018 from BBW?  In the opinion of the authors, what is the confi=
dence=20
interval of the elasticity estimate chosen?  Further, provide California=20
competitive benchmark prices (marginal costs) assuming an elasticity of net=
=20
imports of 0.175 and 0.66 (i.e., 1/2 and 2 times the value used in the=20
study).  Present results in a format similar to Table 1.
