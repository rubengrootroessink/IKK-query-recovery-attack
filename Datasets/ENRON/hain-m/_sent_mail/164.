Gary,

Attached you will find a November RT (Real Time)  Market Default Invoice 
which was receive by EPMI from the PX this morning.

This invoice was published on the PX Settlement Web Site.  Again, the PX 
failed to notify market participants that this invoice was out there.  
Normally they would send an email out and inform all market participants of 
it's availability.  If Market Participants don't know about this invoice 
being out there they will end up defaulting on their payments.  (That may be 
what the PX wants so they can go after the collateral.

If you have any questions please let me know.

Good luck today! - MO
