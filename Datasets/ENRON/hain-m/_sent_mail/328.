Mary:

Dave Corey, PacifiCorp's transmission customer rep will call Lester Rawson on 
Tuesday.  (He's on jury duty Monday and not in now.)

If that is too long, ask Lester to call Jack Stamper at 503-813-5737.

Apparently, the path previously listed should not have been listed because 
PacifiCorp lacks a continuous electrical connection between the two points.  
Somewhere around Walla Walla, BPA's system must be used to get from one part 
of PacifiCorp's system to the other.  Thus, we had to dissect the contract 
path into two PacifiCorp segments--and your people may need to purchase a BPA 
segment also.
