An Edison vice president, Bruce Foster, said the rate increase "is a step i=

"Have we gotten the number right? I don't know," said Commissioner Henry=20
Duque. But PUC President Loretta Lynch said the $4.8 billion will be enough=
=20
to pay California's ongoing power bills.=20
Meanwhile, Gov. Gray Davis repeated his opposition to rate hikes.=20
"We do not have all the appropriate financial numbers necessary to make a=

Yet most observers believe the PUC acted with Davis' approval - three of it=

"It's like dealing with the mob," said Doug Heller of the Foundation for=20

Jamming the PUC's auditorium to near capacity, activists said the state=20

PUC President Lynch partially agreed with the protesters, saying the=20
generators are "the real culprits in our energy crisis." But she said the=

The PUC ordered the utilities to help state officials fight the power=20

Use more energy, pay higher rates=20
By Edie Lau
Bee Science Writer
(Published March 28, 2001)=20
For all the talk of electricity rates going up across the state, there's a=
=20
way every resident of California can avoid the price hit altogether: Just u=
se=20
electricity sparingly.=20
A rate increase approved by the state Public Utilities Commission on Tuesda=
y=20
does not affect households that use less than 130 percent of a baseline=20
amount of power.=20
Forty-five percent of households already stay within that limit, according =
to=20
PUC President Loretta Lynch. The proportion is slightly less in Pacific Gas=
=20
and Electric's territory - 42 percent, utility spokeswoman Jann Tabor said.=
=20
The baseline amount differs from region to region and from season to season=
.=20
The Sacramento Municipal Utility District is not affected by the PUC-approv=
ed=20
increase but is planning to raise rates this spring, as well. It, too,=20
proposes to protect the thriftiest customers by raising the price only of=
=20
kilowatt-hours used over baseline. District rate administrator Alan Wilcox=
=20
said roughly half of SMUD households consume only baseline amounts of power=
.=20
Everyone else has the opportunity to dodge rate increases by scaling back=
=20
their electricity use.=20
How difficult might that be? If you're accustomed to using a central air=20
conditioner all summer and unwilling to turn up the thermostat, it could be=
=20
difficult, by Wilcox's reckoning.=20
"If you're running an air-conditioning load in the Valley, you could probab=
ly=20
expect to get into that second tier (above baseline) a little bit," he said=
.=20
"There are a lot of people who do not use their air conditioning a lot or=
=20
have swamp coolers or just go without."=20
In SMUD territory, the baseline is 700 kilowatt-hours per month in summer,=
=20
and 620 kwh in winter for most customers. (Households that do not use gas a=
nd=20
are powered entirely by electricity get a higher baseline allowance.)=20
Wilcox said the baseline is based upon average consumption - at least, it w=
as=20
the average when the baseline was set in the early 1990s. Consumption has=
=20
crept up a bit since, to 752 kwh a month last year.=20
Under SMUD's rate-increase proposal, the summertime rate would remain at=20
8.058 cents per kilowatt-hour for the first 700 kwh. The price would rise b=
y=20
10 cents a kilowatt-hour for the next 300 kwh used, up to 1,000 kwh.=20
Big energy consumers would pay more than 16 cents for each kwh used over=20
1,000 kwh.=20
Bottom line: The biggest users pay the most.=20
Details of the rate increase approved by the PUC - which will affect PG&E=
=20
customers, as well as those served by Southern California Edison and San=20
Diego Gas & Electric - have yet to be worked out, but the rates are expecte=
d=20
to be structured in a similar tiered fashion.=20
Currently, PG&E customers year-around pay 11.4 cents per kilowatt-hour up t=
o=20
the baseline limit, and 13 cents for every kilowatt-hour over baseline. The=
=20
average baseline throughout the territory is between 300 and 400 kwh, Tabor=
=20
said; it varies from region to region to account for climate.=20
Tabor said the PG&E baseline amounts to between 50 percent and 60 percent o=
f=20
the average electricity use per household in a given territory. That=20
proportion, she said, was taken from a "Lifeline" program in effect from 19=
76=20
to 1984 that was meant to provide a minimum necessary quantity of electrici=
ty=20
and gas at a lower cost.=20
Tabor said 31 percent of PG&E's 4,017,000 residential customers use only=20
baseline amounts of electricity.=20

SAN FRANCISCO -- State regulators yesterday approved the biggest rate=20
increase in California history for the customers of Pacific Gas and Electri=
c=20
and Southern California Edison, but Gov. Gray Davis said the increase is=20
premature.=20
The governor, appearing to soften his long-standing opposition, said he wou=
ld=20
support a rate increase only if financial information shows that a rate=20
increase is "necessary for the good of the state."=20
The Public Utilities Commission, controlled by Davis appointees, voted 5-0=
=20
for an immediate rate increase. A statement from Davis, who usually demands=
=20
that appointees reflect his policy, did not say whether he would ask the PU=
C=20
or the Legislature for a rollback if he concludes the increase is unneeded.=

"He can ask," said Steve Maviglio, Davis' press secretary. "That is one of=
=20
many options. But now we are waiting for the numbers to plug in the data an=
d=20
see if a rate increase is necessary."=20
The PUC has not yet acted on the request of San Diego Gas and Electric for =
a=20
rate increase. SDG&E has a debt of $681 million but has been paying all of=
=20
its bills, unlike PG&E and Edison. Those companies say they have debt of $1=
3=20
billion.=20
SDG&E is in a different situation because its rates were capped by=20
legislation in September that guarantees payment of its debt, allowing the=
=20
utility to borrow. The bills of SDG&E customers soared last summer when the=
=20
utility became the first to be deregulated.=20
"Since the PUC has approved rate hikes for Edison and PG&E, we would hope=
=20
they give an expedited review to our request for an increase of 2.3 cents p=
er=20
kilowatt hour," said Ed Van Herik, a SDG&E spokesman.=20
Consumer groups warned that out-of-state generators, who have been ordered =
by=20
FERC to make some rebates for overcharging, will make even more money under=
=20
the rate increase. Some are urging Davis to seize California power plants=
=20
owned by the generators.=20
"These people are war criminals," said Mike Florio, an attorney for The=20
Utility Reform Network in San Francisco.=20
The PUC meeting, which occurred on a day when the state was hit by a Stage =
2=20
alert because of reduced imports from the Northwest, was interrupted by=20
shouts from demonstrators who want a state-owned power system. They chanted=
,=20
"Public power now, we won't pay" and "Rate hikes no way, make the energy=20

Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa=20
Monica, which is threatening to put a public power initiative on the ballot=

challenged in court.=20
Assemblyman Rod Pacheco, R-Riverside, announced that he will introduce=20

not by appointees but by elected officials who are accountable to the publi=
c.=20
Democratic legislative leaders, who have large majorities in both houses,=
=20
said Monday that they have reluctantly concluded a rate increase is=20
necessary. Davis is scheduled to meet with Assembly Democrats this afternoo=
n.=20
The rate increase approved for PG&E and Edison yesterday is 3 cents per=20
kilowatt hour. The PUC president, Loretta Lynch, said media reports of the=
=20
increase amounting to a 40 percent rise are inaccurate.=20
Lynch said the increase in the monthly bills of ratepayers would be about 2=
6=20
percent if applied across the board. She bases her figure on the total bill=
=20
that includes electricity, transmission, distribution and other costs.=20
The media's characterization of the rate increase as 40 percent is based on=
=20
only the cost of electricity, not the total bill. The electricity costs=20
before the increase were 7.2 cents per kilowatt hour for Edison and 6.7 cen=
ts=20
for PG&E. SDG&E's rate is 6.5 cents.=20
Lynch proposed the rate increase after a report issued last week showed tha=
t=20
the state, which was forced to begin buying power for the utilities in=20
mid-January, will have to spend more than expected. A state plan to lower=
=20
costs through long-term contracts will fall short this summer.=20
The state has been spending about $1.5 billion a month to buy power. The PU=
C=20
also voted unanimously yesterday to give the state a share of the monthly=
=20
bill collected by utilities, which will be used to finance a bond of $10=20
billion or more to repay the state general fund for the power purchases.=20
The state was jolted last week by rolling blackouts that few expected befor=
e=20
summer, when heat drives up the demand for electricity. A number of small=
=20
generators that provide a quarter of the state's power are not operating=20
because they have not been paid by utilities.=20
The PUC voted yesterday to order Edison and PG&E to begin paying the small=
=20
generators under a new formula that links their payments to the price of=20
natural gas at the Oregon border, rather than at the Southern California=20
border with Arizona. Prices at the Arizona border have been 50 percent=20
higher.=20
David Fogarty of the Western States Petroleum Association, which represents=
=20
50 small generators, said many of the small plants in Southern California=
=20
will have to continue to buy their natural gas at the higher price on the=
=20
Arizona border.=20
"Many of them will find it uneconomic to continue to operate," Fogarty=20
warned.=20
Edison has not paid the small generators in the federal "qualifying=20
facilities" program since November. PG&E has been paying them only about 15=
=20
percent.=20
The PUC did not order the utilities to pay off the $1.5 billion they owe to=
=20
the small generators. Jan Smutny-Jones of the Independent Energy Producers=
=20
said some of the small generators will not be able to buy gas until they ca=
n=20
pay their debts.=20
Many of the small generators produce power from "renewable" sources such as=
=20
solar, wind, geothermal and biomass. But most of the small generators use=
=20
natural gas turbines that also produce heat for commercial purposes.=20
Whether Lynch acted on her own when she proposed the increase or was prompt=
ed=20
by the Davis administration is a topic of speculation. Davis aides told=20
reporters during a background briefing yesterday that they did not learn of=
=20
Lynch's proposal until Sunday night.=20
They said the governor was briefed Monday morning and that he did not urge=
=20
his PUC appointees to delay the increase. An Edison official said the utili=
ty=20
received the proposal late Monday morning and had little time to prepare fo=
r=20
a hasty PUC hearing on the increase that afternoon.=20
The two commissioners appointed by former Gov. Pete Wilson, Richard Bilas a=

?????SAN FRANCISCO--With protesters jeering their disapproval, besieged=20
utility regulators Tuesday adopted the largest electricity rate hike in the=
=20
state's history and defended the action as the only way to keep the lights =
on=20
for millions of customers.
?????The California Public Utilities Commission unanimously approved an=20
increase of 3 cents per kilowatt-hour. That will boost rates by as much as=
=20
42% for some Southern California Edison customers and up to 46% for some=20
served by Pacific Gas & Electric Co.
?????The rate increase, which will cost customers nearly $5 billion a year,=
=20
takes effect immediately but will not show up on utility bills until at lea=
st=20
May.
?????The rate hike is the most far-reaching and politically volatile action=
=20
the state has taken thus far to ease an 11-month-old power crisis that has=
=20
nearly bankrupted the two largest utilities and triggered blackouts. But=20
critics say it does not solve the fundamental problem of runaway wholesale=
=20
electricity prices.
?????"The PUC has done all it can do to fight wholesale energy prices that=
=20
are unjust and unreasonable," said commission President Loretta Lynch. "We=
=20
maintain the responsibility to keep the lights on. . . . I believe that=20
adding another 3 cents will comprehensively address the need for revenues."
?????The commission took steps to have utilities begin paying the state=20
Department of Water Resources for the nearly $3 billion in power it has=20
purchased for them since mid-January.
?????The PUC also ordered utilities to start paying for future power from=
=20
alternative energy producers who are starved for cash and struggling to=20
operate. The blackouts last Monday and Tuesday were precipitated in part by=
=20
loss of power from such companies.
?????But it was the rate increase proposal that packed the auditorium at PU=
C=20
headquarters. And the drama of the vote--and the vocal opposition--spurred=
=20
each of the five commissioners to forcefully defend the unpopular action.
?????"These are extraordinary moments in California's history," declared=20
Commissioner Geoffrey Brown, a recent appointee of Gov. Gray Davis. "And=20
extraordinary moments require extraordinary courage. Loretta Lynch has take=
n=20
a lot of bad hits. But it was she who stepped up to the role of leader in=
=20
California."

?????Rate Increase Lacked Support
?????Lynch proposed the rate increase, even though an administrative law=20
judge at the PUC concluded that an increase was unnecessary and the PUC's o=
wn=20
consumer protection arm, the Office of Ratepayer Advocates, opposed it. She=
=20
also did not have the public support of Davis, who appointed her and two=20
other commissioners.
?????Davis has distanced himself from the PUC's action, saying the commissi=
on=20
was acting independently and that he remains unconvinced that a rate increa=
se=20
is necessary.
?????Commissioners Henry Duque and Richard Bilas--who were appointed by=20
Republican Gov. Pete Wilson--called the rate hikes long overdue.
?????"Unless ratepayers want to face substantial rolling blackouts this=20
summer, we have to start paying our power bills," Duque said. "It cannot be=
=20
done with the current rates."
?????Saying "there is just no blood left in the turnip," Bilas warned that=
=20
"absent an immediate rate increase, the utilities will be in Bankruptcy=20
Court."
?????Before the vote, sign-carrying protesters chanted, "Rate hikes, no way=
,=20
make the energy companies pay." And the commission heard a parade of=20
witnesses, most opposing the rate increase. Some called on the state to use=
=20
eminent domain to seize power plants, as Davis said he might do as a last=
=20
resort.
?????Doug Heller, of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in San=
ta=20
Monica, told the commission, "Go to these power pirates and tell them the=
=20
state treasury is not their money orchard."
?????Barbara George, of Women's Energy Matters, said, "We should give the=
=20
generators 24 hours to sign their plants over to the state and leave." Geor=
ge=20
was one of several people ejected for repeatedly disrupting the meeting.
?????At a hearing Monday, representatives of agriculture and manufacturing=
=20
industries warned that the increase would hurt their members and the=20
California economy.
?????The rate hike is the state's largest, according to the Office of=20
Ratepayer Advocates, which researched the issue.
?????Because the electricity rate is just one of many charges on a monthly=
=20
utility bill, the overall effect will be about a 28% increase in monthly=20
bills, said PUC staff.
?????Before the PUC action, homeowners and renters in Edison territory paid=
=20
7.2 cents per kilowatt-hour for electricity and another 5.3 cents per=20
kilowatt-hour for other services. The new rate, totaling 15.5 cents per=20
kilowatt-hour, boosts the overall bill by about 24%. The increase is about=
=20
26% for PG&E residential customers. But under Lynch's proposal, those=20
increases would not be applied equally.
?????To encourage conservation, she seeks a tiered system that would charge=
=20
miserly consumers of energy no more than current rates but would impose the=
=20
new higher rates on bigger users.
?????The proposal aims the rate increase at those customers who use 30% or=
=20
more beyond a so-called baseline amount, which is about half of the average=
=20
residential use per month and varies by region.
?????Exactly who will pay the higher electricity rate will be determined by=
=20
the PUC in hearings over the next month. Under Lynch's proposal, nearly hal=
f=20
of all residential customers would be spared rate increases.

?????Tiered Rates to Encourage Saving
?????Energy experts say tiered rates would encourage conservation, but they=
=20
disagree about how much.
?????Davis energy advisor S. David Freeman, general manager of the Los=20
Angeles Department of Water and Power, said utilities have long used tiered=
=20
rates when charging low-income customers. "So this is not brand new. It's=
=20
just a more aggressive use of it," he said.
?????UC Irvine economist Peter Navarro said he doubted that tiered rates=20
would do much to stave off blackouts. The greatest conservation gains come=
=20
from investment in efficient appliances, he said, and that's why tiered rat=
es=20
are "no magic bullet."
?????The increase will not show up in utility bills until May at the=20
earliest, said Paul Clanon, chief of the PUC's energy division.
?????The higher charges for electricity consumed between now and whenever t=
he=20
new rate structure is incorporated in monthly bills will be calculated=20
retroactively and charged to future bills, Clanon said.
?????Utility executives and consumer advocates all threw up their hands at=
=20
the question of whether the rate hike will be enough.
?????"Have we gotten the number right?" Duque said. "I don't know. I hope w=
e=20
have. But this is a step in the right direction, and we'll return any money=
=20
not used to buy power."
?????Bruce Foster, a Southern California Edison vice president, also said t=
he=20
rate increase is a step in the right direction. "Only time will tell," he=
=20
said, "if it is sufficient to meet the need."
?????In a statement, PG&E welcomed the PUC action as a "dose of realism," b=
ut=20
said the commission left unresolved a host of issues, including how much=20
money the utility will have to pay for power that the state purchases for=
=20
PG&E customers.
?????The PUC estimates that the increase will bring in an additional $4.8=
=20
billion annually from the 24 million people served by Edison and PG&E.
?????But that amount doesn't go far in today's California wholesale=20
electricity market.
?????The state and utilities spent $5.2 billion in January buying=20
electricity. The state, through the Department of Water Resources, has spen=
t=20
nearly $3 billion in taxpayer money to buy electricity on behalf of the=20
utilities since Jan. 19 because power generators refused to sell to the=20
cash-strapped utilities.
?????Money utilities collect from their customers, even with the new rate=
=20
hike, is expected to cover a wide array of expenses, including payments on=
=20
$10 billion or more in revenue bonds that the state hopes to sell this spri=
ng=20
to cover the state's cost of buying power.
?????"The numbers don't add up," said Jason Zeller, an attorney with the=20
Office of Ratepayer Advocates. "Massive [additional rate] increases are my=

concern. We are sticking a finger in the dike unless wholesale prices come=

With Energy Crisis Far From Over, Experts Say More Hikes Possible=20

Power: PUC action leaves questions unanswered, such as how to handle=20
utilities' debts, whether to buy grid.=20

By JENIFER WARREN and MIGUEL BUSTILLO, Times Staff Writers=20

?????As painful as Tuesday's electricity rate increase will be for some=20
consumers, power experts across the ideological spectrum say California is=
=20
not yet close to being free of the energy crisis that has engulfed it and=
=20
threatened its economy.
?????Because of that, still more rate hikes are possible, they say.
?????Consumer advocates, power company officials, legislators and regulator=
s=20
disagree widely on the causes of and cures for the state's problems. But th=
ey=20
agree that California's energy woes are dizzyingly complex. And the rate hi=
ke=20
makes nary a dent in many dimensions of the problem.
?????"Is it over? Heavens no!" said Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg (D-Los=20
Angeles), who heads a state Assembly panel investigating summertime power=
=20
supply issues. "It's a necessary step, but we're certainly not out of the=
=20
woods yet."
?????The increase, along with another important action Tuesday by the PUC,=
=20
did resolve two major issues--how the state will continue to buy electricit=
y=20
that the financially shaky utility companies cannot purchase and how=20
electricity consumers will repay California's treasury for those purchases.
?????But the commission left unresolved a host of other questions: what to =
do=20
with the roughly $14 billion in debt the state's two biggest utility=20
companies racked up in recent months buying expensive power; whether the=20
state will buy the electricity transmission grid those utilities own; where=
=20
to find about $1.5 billion the utilities owe to producers of alternative=20
energy, many of whom have not been paid in months; and how to wrap up=20
negotiations to sign long-term contracts with generators to supply power in=
=20
years to come.
?????Said PUC President Loretta Lynch: "Until we can get wholesale prices=
=20
under control and get folks to conserve, we're going to be in this pickle f=
or=20
a while."
?????Resolving the issue of repaying the treasury for power purchases was=
=20
crucial because the state is spending $45 million to $55 million a day to b=
uy=20
electricity. To cover those costs, the state is supposed to float bonds,=20
which would be repaid from electricity bills. But without the higher rates,=
=20
officials feared there would be no way to cover the bond payments. And=20
without the bonds, all state taxpayers--and not just customers of the priva=
te=20
utilities--would be on the hook for the debt.
?????In addition to raising rates, the PUC on Tuesday approved a formula th=
at=20
will determine the size of the bond issue, expected to be the largest of it=
s=20
kind in U.S. history.
?????The formula allows for $12 billion in bonds. The state's three major=
=20
private utilities, Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric and S=
an=20
Diego Gas & Electric, will have to determine how much power the state is=20
buying for them--the figure is roughly 30%--and use a proportionate amount =
of=20
the money they collect from customers to pay the state back.
?????A $12-billion bond issue is significantly larger than earlier estimate=
s=20
that pegged it at $10 billion. But even the larger number is far less than=
=20
some believe will eventually be needed to cover the cost of power the state=
=20
is buying.
?????Unless prices are stabilized, state Treasurer Phil Angelides and other=
s=20
have warned, further bond issues may be needed. Those, in turn, could requi=
re=20
more rate increases.
?????"It's possible that, with the rate increase and if we do a good job wi=
th=20
conservation, it's possible that [the bonds] may be less," said state Sen.=
=20
Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Ray). "It's also possible that, given the situati=
on=20
this summer, where we have not been able to secure anything close to our=20
power needs . . . we could be paying significantly more."
?????The rate increase, which kicks in only for customers who use=20
significantly more power than a "baseline" amount, is intended to ease the=
=20
situation by inducing conservation and thereby cutting demand--forcing=20
"energy hogs" to switch off spa pumps or pay the price, as Lynch put it.
?????But no one can predict how the "hogs" will respond or whether the rate=
=20
hike--plus conservation incentives moving through the Legislature and the=
=20
completion of several new power plants this summer--will be enough to spare=
=20
the state from forced outages.
?????Tuesday did little to fuel optimism. Despite temperatures far milder=
=20
than on a typical summer day, another Stage 2 energy alert was declared by=
=20
the state's Independent System Operator after imports dropped sharply. The=
=20
state avoided blackouts, "but it was really close," a Cal-ISO spokeswoman=
=20
said.
?????Some state forecasts have California squeaking through the hot months=
=20
with no outages, but private forecasters see at least 20 hours of blackouts=
.=20
And Reliant Energy, one of the power plant owners, predicts 1,100 hours of=
=20
blackouts in the state this year.
?????Beyond the problems of supply, the state has still not resolved the=20
question of the utilities' debt. Edison and PG&E say they've lost nearly $1=
4=20
billion since June because they have had to pay high wholesale power prices=
=20
that the state's deregulation law bars them from passing on to ratepayers.
?????Although the PUC estimates that the rate increase will generate an=20
additional $4.8 billion in revenue annually, most of that will go to paying=
=20
off bonds and other expenses. None is earmarked to relieve the utilities'=
=20
debt.
?????"When you do the math, the amount of money just doesn't get you very=
=20
far," said Assemblyman Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek).
?????That is where buying the transmission lines is supposed to enter the=
=20
picture. Gov. Gray Davis wants the state to pay $7 billion for the lines.=
=20
PG&E and Edison could then use the infusion of cash to pay off their bills=
=20
and become credit-worthy once more.
?????But negotiations over sale of the transmission grid seem to have bogge=
d=20
down. Meanwhile, support for the deal in the Legislature appears to be=20
slipping. Republicans have long been opposed, but now support among Democra=
ts=20
is waning.
?????Keeley, a critic of the transmission purchase all along, believes that=
=20
the state should instead buy the utilities' hydro-electric generators,=20
contending that they would bring in revenue from the power generated at the=
=20
dams.
?????"We're just going to sink dough into that [transmission system]," Keel=
ey=20
said, adding that the grid needs an estimated $1 billion in repairs. The=20
hydro system, by contrast, would be a revenue-producing asset that could he=
lp=20
lower rates, he said.
?????A related question--still unresolved--is the fate of the state's nearl=
y=20
700 producers of alternative and renewable energy, which supply more than a=
=20
quarter of the electricity used by California consumers. In a separate acti=
on=20
Tuesday, the PUC ordered utilities to begin paying the producers--whose=20
megawatts are desperately needed and who, in many instances, have not been=
=20
paid since November.
?????On Tuesday, the small producers delivered a little more than half of=
=20
their usual supplies to the utilities--a trend that has dragged on for=20
several weeks and last week helped nudge the state into blackouts.
?????Producers welcomed the PUC's order that they start getting paid. But,=
=20
they said, the move failed to address back payments, estimated at $1.5=20
billion, owed by Edison and PG&E.
?????"Generators find it more predictable and less risky to operate in Thir=
d=20
World countries than they do in the state of California," griped Marty Quin=
n,=20
executive vice president and chief operating officer of Ridgewood Power LLC=
,=20
which owns three small gas-fired generators.
?????Any move to resolve that issue, of course, would increase the debt owe=
d=20
by the utilities.
?????On another front, state negotiators are finding it difficult to seal=
=20
long-term electricity contracts at rates more favorable than those on the=
=20
volatile spot market.
?????So far, only 22 contracts have been signed, in part because generators=
=20
are reluctant to commit to lower prices while they're still owed billions o=
f=20
dollars by the near-bankrupt utilities. Experts say the power secured by th=
e=20
current contracts will supply less than half of what the state will need th=
is=20
summer.
?????Despite all the unsettled questions, at least one utility analyst, Dan=
=20
Ford of the Lehman Bros. investment firm, said the PUC's actions should=20
remove the immediate threat of utility bankruptcy and begin to lift the=20
"California cloud" over electricity generators.
?????But in a sign that the energy crisis is still causing concern on Wall=
=20
Street, Standard & Poor's said it would continue to carry a cautionary cred=

rating for the state.
?????The rating agency, which placed California on a "credit watch" after t=

state government began spending millions to purchase electricity, said in a=
=20
news release that it was not clear whether the rate hike would be enough.
?????Hovering in the background, meanwhile, is the threat of a ballot=20
initiative that could unravel whatever solutions state officials ultimately=

that any utility "bailout" would likely trigger a "voter revolt."

NEWS ANALYSIS
Davis Keeps His Distance From Utility Rate Hikes=20

By DAN MORAIN, Times Staff Writer=20

?????SACRAMENTO--Gov. Gray Davis, convinced that he can't win votes by=20
delivering bad news, avoided the task of telling Californians what virtuall=
y=20
all experts have been saying for months--that electricity bills are going u=
p.
?????Indeed, on Tuesday, the Democratic governor quickly moved to distance=
=20
himself from a rate hike of as much as 46% that was approved by the=20
California Public Utilities Commission, led by his appointee Loretta Lynch.
?????That and other recent moves have thrown Davis' credibility into=20
question--even in his own Democratic Party.
?????"If you're the governor," said political consultant Darry Sragow, "you=
=20
don't want to take the blame for a massive rate increase that is not going =
to=20
sit well with a lot of voters. You want to be in a position where you can=
=20
say, 'I didn't have a choice; my back was against the wall.' "
?????Davis describes his view of the situation as "optimistic." He has call=
ed=20
it an "energy challenge," not a crisis, even as the state's two largest=20
utilities border on bankruptcy, and the state experienced blackouts a week=
=20
ago, in mid-March, when electricity use was 50% less than it will be in the=
=20
summer, when demand is highest.
?????Davis and his aides say the governor is fully engaged in the problem,=
=20
understands its many dimensions and is working long hours to solve it. But=
=20
the crisis wears on, and an increasing number of lawmakers, including fello=
w=20
Democrats, are alarmed.
?????"It's an energy crisis, not an energy challenge," said Senate Energy=
=20
Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey), who began warning of a=
=20
coming energy shortage 13 months ago.
?????"This is a major crisis," Sen. Don Perata (D-Alameda) said, "and it=20
would appear he is overwhelmed by it."
?????"If you don't face reality," said Sen. John Vasconcellos (D-Santa=20
Clara), "you can't possibly improve it. His posture has been baffling. I=20
lament what is going on. This is my beloved state, and we're in serious=20
peril, and it scares me."
?????Many academics, utility executives, Wall Street analysts and legislato=
rs=20
concluded weeks and months ago that rate hikes were necessary, given the=20
soaring wholesale price of electricity. Even Davis has acknowledged that a=
=20
rate hike might solve the situation.
?????"Believe me," Davis said Feb. 16, "if I wanted to raise rates, I could=
=20
have solved this problem in 20 minutes."
?????But in a reaction that added to lawmakers' bewilderment, Davis said in=
 a=20
statement Tuesday that the PUC action was "premature because we do not have=
=20
all the appropriate finance numbers necessary to make a decision."
?????"Until we do," the statement continued, "I cannot support any rate=20
increase."
?????In taking steps to raise rates, Lynch may well end up taking substanti=
al=20
flak for her governor.
?????"Recent polls show the PUC is very unpopular in this state," Sragow=20
said. "Gray Davis is still popular. Voters clearly don't see a connection=
=20
between the governor and the PUC."
?????Davis' aides say the governor didn't talk to Lynch before she acted.=
=20
Lynch, a frequent visitor to the Capitol, was in Sacramento late last week=
=20
and again Tuesday. She may not have spoken to Davis, but she did make other=
=20
top administration officials aware of her plans.
?????Lynch could have decided to act on her own. The state Constitution giv=
es=20
the commission authority to raise utility rates. But the governor is well=
=20
known as a micro-manager, involved in the most minute details of state=20
governance. Davis repeatedly has said he expects all his appointees to "thi=
nk=20
like I think," and not to act on their own.
?????As recently as last week, Davis directed that the PUC take specific=20
actions to help ensure that alternative energy producers get paid.
?????Davis has said the Legislature's job is to implement his vision. He ha=
s=20
said judges he appoints who later break from him on major issues should=20
resign. His appointees "should not be free agents."
?????So he strained his credibility by saying he was unaware that Lynch wou=
ld=20
move to raise rates Tuesday, particularly given events that occurred late=
=20
last week.
?????On Friday, Davis Finance Director Tim Gage and Susan Kennedy, one of h=
is=20
top aides, met with Assembly leaders behind closed doors. At the meeting, a=
=20
participant warned that rates might have to rise 50% to 100%.
?????Also Friday, a top aide to Davis told The Times that Davis' staff was=
=20
convinced that a rate hike was necessary, even as Davis continued to public=
ly=20
oppose it. On Sunday, a top Davis aide referred reporters to Lynch, who=20
confirmed that she would move to raise rates Tuesday.
?????Two months ago, Harry Snyder of Consumers Union was defending Davis.=
=20
Now, Snyder, who has worked with Davis on various issues for decades, is,=
=20
like many others, raising questions about the governor's credibility, his=
=20
penchant for secrecy and his competence.
?????"Something is wrong," Snyder said. "Either he is over his depth, or it=
=20
is hubris, or it is the great river in Egypt, 'Denial.' "
?????Here are some of the governor's statements and actions, since called=
=20
into question:
?????* Davis held a news conference Feb. 23 to say he had reached an=20
agreement on a rescue plan with Southern California Edison that included a=
=20
deal to buy its massive transmission system for $2.76 billion. A final=20
package, he said, would be announced within a week, not only with Edison bu=
t=20
with San Diego Gas and Electric.
?????A month later, a top utility executive described the talks as=20
"dreadfully slow." Negotiations over a similar deal with Pacific Gas &=20
Electric, which he said back in February would be completed by now, are eve=
n=20
further behind.
?????* Davis has refused to release details about contracts he signed with=
=20
independent generators to buy power. He said, however, that the contracts=
=20
accounted for 6,000 to 7,000 megawatts of electricity this summer, a=20
significant amount that would help protect the state from having to buy muc=
h=20
of its power on the far more costly spot market.
?????Last week, when he released some scant details in a report on the=20
contracts, experts who read it concluded that California would be forced to=
=20
buy half or more of its electricity on the expensive spot market.
?????* Davis brushed aside reporters' questions last week about the blackou=
ts=20
that rolled across the state. He remained cloistered as the outages continu=
ed=20
for a second day, emerging only after they ended to announce a plan to ensu=
re=20
that alternative energy producers would be paid. A week after he called on=
=20
lawmakers to quickly approve a bill that would help get them paid, the=20
legislation remains stalled.
?????"It is inept at all levels and doesn't encourage any confidence that h=
e=20
can handle it," Snyder said. "Moreover, it doesn't encourage us that he is=
=20
going to tell the truth."
?????The energy crisis is perilous for Davis' reelection effort next year.=
=20
But the governor's strategy of being unremittingly optimistic and going to=
=20
great lengths to maintain his opposition to rate hikes, could be to his=20
benefit when he faces voters.
?????"Ethically," said UC Berkeley political scientist Bruce Cain, "not bei=
ng=20
forthcoming is worse. Politically, the more he can obfuscate, the more like=
ly=20
it is some people will buy the obfuscation. . . . The reason we see=20
obfuscation is that obfuscation works."
?????Not all politicians follow that maxim.
?????Davis' predecessor, Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, held a news conferenc=
e=20
in 1991, as California plunged into a recession, to announce that he was=20
pushing for what became the largest tax increase in state history, calling =
it=20
necessary to help erase a $14-billion deficit. Top advisors had urged him t=
o=20
leave the delivery of such bad news to others.
?????"Any time you deliver bad news to voters you're taking a risk," said D=
an=20
Schnur, who was Wilson's spokesman. "But it is a much bigger risk to allow =

?????WASHINGTON--What are the chances that federal regulators will order=20
electricity wholesalers to refund $6.3 billion in alleged overcharges?
?????Zero.
?????Officials of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission have=20
already made clear that nearly $3 billion--almost half the total that=20
California's grid operator said last week was excessive--is off the table=
=20
because a statute of limitations puts alleged overcharges that took place=
=20
before Oct. 2 beyond their reach.=20
?????As for the rest, lawyers familiar with the agency and industry observe=
rs=20
note that FERC has consistently hesitated to use its full legal authority t=
o=20
enforce "fair and reasonable" rates because of difficulty in defining that=
=20
phrase. Some within FERC question how much of the "excessive" rates=20
documented by the California Independent System Operator fall beyond FERC's=
=20
jurisdiction--for example, rates charged by municipal power suppliers that=
=20
are not regulated by the federal agency.
?????So far, FERC has ordered electricity wholesalers to justify or refund=
=20
only $124 million in alleged overcharges--just 5% of the amount that the=20
Cal-ISO has identified. That sum deals only with rates charged in January a=
nd=20
February 2001 during Stage 3 alerts--periods when electricity reserves fall=
=20
below 1.5%.
?????FERC's approach to the alleged California overcharges will probably no=
t=20
become any more aggressive as a result of the two new members it will soon=
=20
have. President Bush has picked two state utility regulators to fill=20
vacancies on the five-member commission, the White House announced Tuesday.
?????The president plans to nominate Pat Wood III, chairman of the Texas=20
Utility Commission and a Bush ally, and Nora Mead Brownell, a member of the=
=20
Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, to the FERC governing board.
?????Administration officials have indicated that Wood, 38, would assume th=
e=20
FERC chairmanship, a position now held by Curt Hebert Jr., a staunch advoca=
te=20
of energy deregulation.

?????Shake-Up at FERC Was Expected
?????The shake-up has been expected because of continuing complaints that=
=20
FERC has not been aggressive enough in dealing with high energy prices and=
=20
electricity shortages in California and elsewhere in the West. Hebert in=20
particular has angered California officials with his opposition to price=20
controls on wholesale electricity sales.
?????Although the administration wants to appear sympathetic to California'=
s=20
plight, replacing Hebert has been a problem because he is a protege of Sena=
te=20
Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.).
?????Cal-ISO officials--who pointed out that their $6.3-billion figure was=
=20
part of a study calling for stronger market controls, not for refunds--may=
=20
still formally ask FERC to augment the refund order for January and Februar=
y.=20
FERC ordered wholesalers to justify $124 million worth of charges shortly=
=20
after Cal-ISO asked for $550 million in refunds for December and January.
?????FERC's refund process reflects the ambiguities facing federal regulato=
rs=20
who oversee an electricity market that was designed to follow the law of=20
supply and demand. At stake may be the final bill for electricity used to=
=20
date in California as well as future rates.
?????And the debate over the role refunds should play in addressing=20
skyrocketing wholesale electricity prices underscores diverging philosophie=
s=20
of what went wrong in the California market and how to fix it. What role=20
should the government--specifically FERC, an agency with a mandate to ensur=
e=20
"fair and reasonable" rates--play?
?????"The whole notion that there's such a thing as a just price is kind of=
=20
an anachronism from New Deal days," said Pietro Nivola, a Brookings Institu=
te=20
scholar who studies regulatory politics. "Especially as we move closer to=
=20
some form of deregulation, we've come to understand that the price is what=
=20
the traffic will bear. In this case, utilities simply have to be able to ge=
t=20
higher rates at the retail end."
?????But others say FERC has failed to assert its authority, allowing the=
=20
wholesalers to operate with impunity.
?????"The message FERC has sent so far is, as long as you leave 10 cents of=
=20
every dollar in the bank we won't pull the alarm," said Mark Cooper, direct=
or=20
of research for the Consumer Federation of America.
?????Some on Capitol Hill say a massive refund order by FERC--while highly=
=20
unlikely--would go a long way toward reining in wholesale prices. But FERC=
=20
officials and many economists say that view is myopic and may do more harm=
=20
than good, potentially discouraging new suppliers from entering a market=20
already too tight. The memory of the 1970s oil crisis and a prevalent view=
=20
among economists that government intervention made matters worse has inform=
ed=20
the views of some longtime government officials and observers.

?????Refunds Called 'Inferior Remedy'
?????A clear sign of FERC's reluctance to call for refunds came late last=
=20
year, when the commission issued its initial proposition for remedies for t=
he=20
California price increases. FERC officials said at the time, "Refunds may b=
e=20
an inferior remedy from a market perspective and not the fundamental soluti=
on=20
to any problems occurring in California markets."
?????The decision by FERC to scrutinize electricity charges only during Sta=
ge=20
3 alerts in January and February was harshly criticized earlier this month =
by=20
some lawmakers and utility company officials. They complained that the narr=
ow=20
focus eliminated tens of millions of dollars in charges some observers=20
believed were outrageous.
?????But even the $124 million questioned by FERC has been defended by the=
=20
wholesale companies. In briefs filed with the agency last week, they said=
=20
rates exceeding $430 per megawatt-hour--compared with a pre-crisis average =
of=20
$30 per megawatt-hour--were justified by the increased credit risk=20
wholesalers took in selling to near-bankrupt utilities that have billions o=
f=20
dollars in outstanding debts.
?????Duke Energy, which FERC has said overcharged California by $20 million=
,=20
signaled some room for compromise in its compliance filing.=20
?????"We would be willing to forgo collection of credit premiums for these=
=20
months provided we were paid the FERC clearing price," company president Ji=
m=20
Donnell said this week. "If we are not assured payment, the credit premiums=
=20
are obviously appropriate, and we would reserve our right to collect the=20
entire amount of the bids that are subject to the FERC order."
?????Both of Bush's Republican nominees to the commission are expected to w=
in=20
Senate confirmation. But they can expect a grilling from Sen. Dianne=20
Feinstein (D-Calif.), who has accused power suppliers of price-gouging and=
=20
FERC of doing little to stop it.=20
?????"Certainly, my vote would be dependent on whether they're going to be=
=20
responsive to the present situation," Feinstein said Tuesday, grousing that=
=20
the administration has been "recalcitrant to the point of arrogance."
?????Feinstein met Tuesday with Vice President Dick Cheney, head of a White=
=20
House energy task force, but she described the meeting as "disappointing."=
=20
Feinstein also sent a letter to Bush asking to meet with him on the=20
California crisis, and adding a hand-written note: "The West needs your hel=
p."
?????A spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis said he hoped the new commissioners=20
would have a "more sympathetic ear" for the concerns of the Western states.
?????But word of the nominations came as Bush reiterated his opposition to=
=20
price controls. "Price controls contributed to the gas lines of the 1970s,=
=20
and the United States will not repeat the mistake again," he said in a spee=
ch=20
in Kalamazoo, Mich.
?????The nominees drew praise from the Electric Power Supply Assn. The grou=
p=20
expressed confidence that they would be "strong proponents of completing th=
e=20
much-needed transition to truly competitive and vibrant power markets all=
=20
across the country."
?????Neither Wood nor Brownell could be reached for comment. Wood said in a=
=20
statement: "On our best day as regulators, we cannot deliver benefits to=20
customers as well as a functional market can. But the market must work righ=
t=20

A Painful Step=20
Electricity rate increase may help, but Gov. Davis is yet to offer an=20
understandable plan to end the crisis.=20

?????By approving a whopping rate hike for big power users, the state Publi=
c=20
Utilities Commission finally has recognized the grim reality of the=20
electricity market in California, even if Gov. Gray Davis has not.=20
Electricity costs more these days, even aside from the piratical rates=20
charged by big generating companies at times during this emergency.=20
?????The increase, while probably necessary, will not by itself solve the=
=20
crisis or prevent rolling blackouts this summer. The two biggest private=20
utilities, Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric, still are=
=20
saddled with as much as $13 billion in debt for past power purchases. State=
=20
government still is shelling out some $50 million in daily power purchases=
=20
and has committed as much as $40 billion to future power contracts. Davis=
=20
continues to negotiate a takeover of the utilities' share of the state powe=
r=20
transmission grid in exchange for paying off some of the utilities' debts.=
=20
?????Despite all the hand-wringing and arm-waving, nothing that state=20
government has done since January has provided any significant new power=20
generation or conservation. Consumers are right to wonder what happened to =
a=20
promised statewide conservation campaign. After first ducking the power=20
problem, Davis launched a flurry of initiatives early in the year, most of=
=20
them still works in progress. But he still has not given the people an=20
understandable, coherent plan for getting out of this fix. Worse, he refuse=
s=20
even to say how much the state is spending on power even as he plunges=20
Sacramento into the power business for decades into the future.=20
?????The irony of Tuesday's rate increase is that the state might have dodg=
ed=20
much of the mess if it had raised rates three months ago. But Davis, seekin=
g=20
reelection next year, insisted that the crisis be solved "within the existi=
ng=20
rate structure." Late last week he attended a political fund-raiser at a Pa=
lm=20
Springs golf club while his staff was being briefed on the need for higher=
=20
rates, literally distancing himself from the act.=20
?????The rate increase, which will be drafted over the next 30 days, affect=
s=20
customers of Edison and PG&E but not residents of Los Angeles or other citi=
es=20
with full municipal power systems. The stated intent is that bigger users,=
=20
particularly businesses, will pay higher rates and be encouraged to save=20
major amounts of power during the summer. Under one scenario, nearly half o=
f=20
households--low and medium users--would pay no more than they do now. The=
=20
boost is also intended to compensate taxpayers for the state's daily power=
=20
purchases, although there is no assurance yet that the new rates will meet=
=20
the full cost. The increase should be structured to give ratepayers some=20
relief if lawsuits against power generators' exorbitant pricing are=20
successful in winning refunds.=20
?????Those skeptical ratepayers who believe that the crisis is just a big=
=20
rip-off by the utilities and the energy companies will consider the increas=
e=20
more of the same. You can't blame them, considering the lack of straight ta=
lk=20
from the governor, including his dodging of the rate issue.=20
?????However, most state experts, including Davis' own utilities=20
commissioners, say the rate increase is a critical first step in solving=20
California's power problems. If Davis has a plan to fix the problem some=20
other way, he should present it in detail to the people of California now.=

PUC Votes To Jack Up Power Rates=20

The bill finally came due for California's experiment with electricity=20
deregulation as consumers were hit yesterday with the largest rate increase=
=20
in state history, an average 40 percent jump in monthly power costs.=20
The immediate rate hike was unanimously approved by the Public Utilities=20
Commission during a rowdy meeting that was repeatedly interrupted by chanti=
ng=20
and jeers from protesters.=20
Highway Patrol officers were directed by PUC President Loretta Lynch to=20
remove several demonstrators from the packed San Francisco auditorium.=20
"These are extraordinary moments in California's history, and extraordinary=
=20
moments demand extraordinary courage," PUC member Geoffrey Brown said befor=
e=20
the rate increase was passed.=20
The commissioners approved a new 30 percent increase and made permanent a=
=20
"temporary" 10 percent increase adopted in January. This will allow the=20
state's two largest utilities to charge customers an extra $4.8 billion a=
=20

=20
skyrocketing costs charged by power companies for electricity and the=20
relatively low amount paid by consumers under California's 1996 deregulatio=
n=20
law.=20
However, consumers' bills will not go up until a "tiered" rate system can b=
e=20
introduced, requiring those who use more power to pay higher fees. That=20
system is expected to be in place by May.=20
Gov. Gray Davis, who has tried to distance himself from the PUC's move sinc=
e=20
it was unveiled Monday, said in a statement yesterday that the rate increas=
e=20
was "premature" and that he did not support the decision.=20
"While I have opposed rate increases, if it becomes clear that a rate=20
increase is absolutely necessary for the good of the state, I will support=
=20
one that is fair and do my duty to convince Californians of its necessity,"=
=20
he said.=20
Several PUC members acknowledged that such a huge rate increase might not=
=20
have been necessary had the commission acted sooner to remedy California's=
=20
power woes.=20
"We should have done this in January," Brown said, "but we didn't have enou=
gh=20
information."=20
"This rate increase is long overdue," said Richard Bilas, who also sits on=
=20
the commission. "We are finally transfusing some blood."=20
CONSUMERS PROTEST
If so, the donor -- ratepayers -- did not go willingly to the operating=20
theater. A number of citizens rose to speak at yesterday's meeting, and not=
=20
one was in favor of higher power rates.=20
"This is being shoved down the people's throats," said Dorothy Diez, an=20
elderly San Francisco resident. "Why don't they put the bills where they=20
belong and not on my back?"=20
She and others called on state officials to take a harder line with out-of-=
=20
state power generators, which have reaped windfall profits by charging sky-=
=20
high wholesale prices for their electricity.=20
Consumer groups urged the PUC to support special taxes on the generators'=
=20
earnings or even seizure of the companies' California power plants.=20
"Your actions are reprehensible," Ross Mirkarimi, a public-power supporter,=
=20
told the commission. "Do not do Gov. Davis' dirty work."=20
The governor did not attend yesterday's meeting, but his presence nonethele=
ss=20
loomed large over the proceedings.=20
Consumer advocates derided Davis' claims this week that he played no role i=
n=20
the decision to raise rates. They noted that the governor's appointees hold=
 a=20
majority on the PUC and worked closely with Davis on a variety of past=20
issues.=20
Davis' staff was briefed on the rate hike before the PUC publicized its=20
decision.=20
'DAVIS CONTROLS PUC'=20
"Gov. Davis controls the PUC," said Doug Heller, assistant organizing=20
director of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. "He is=20
responsible for the rate hike. We are paying more because of the failure of=
=20
his leadership."=20
"It seems absurd that Gov. Davis is saying his own agency is acting without=
=20
his consent," said Susannah Churchill, head of energy policy for the=20
California Public Interest Research Group. "He's just looking for political=
=20
cover."=20
The PUC decision was made on a day when California's grid operators declare=
d=20
a Stage 2 alert, the first in a week, indicating that power reserves had=20
dropped below 5 percent.=20
When tiered rates are implemented, customers of Pacific Gas and Electric Co=
.=20
will see rates go up between 9 percent for "medium" power users and 36=20
percent for "heavy" users.=20
Those who can keep power consumption to within 130 percent of pre-=20
established limits will see no increase beyond the 10 percent rate hike=20
adopted in January.=20
Customers of Southern California Edison will see rates increase between 8 a=
nd=20
27 percent.=20
Bruce Foster, an Edison vice president, called the rate increase "a step in=
=20
the right direction," but said further increases may be needed to defray=20
soaring power costs this summer.=20
PG&E spokesman Ron Low said the San Francisco utility needs to study the=20
PUC's decision more closely before determining whether a 40 percent rate hi=
ke=20
will be sufficient.=20
"The PUC has done all it can," said Lynch, the PUC president. "We have foug=
ht=20
back hard in every venue possible against unjust energy prices."=20
NO FEDERAL HELP
In the end, though, she said state regulators were forced to admit that no=
=20
help would be forthcoming from federal authorities in capping wholesale pow=
er=20
rates, and that generators would continue exploiting California's chronic=
=20
electricity shortage.=20
"We maintain a responsibility to keep the lights on," Lynch said.=20
Along the same lines, the PUC approved a requirement that PG&E and Edison=
=20
repay the state Department of Water Resources for about $4 billion in power=
=20
purchases made on the cash-strapped utilities' behalf.=20
The commission also passed a motion forcing PG&E and Edison to pay smaller=
=20
power generators for their output. Half of all such generators were shut do=
wn=20
during last week's blackouts because they had not been paid by the utilitie=
s.=20
However, the PUC is only requiring that utilities pay for future electricit=
y=20
purchases, and did not address the millions of dollars in payments still ow=
ed=20
the power companies.=20
Ann MacLeod, executive director of the California Cogeneration Council, an=
=20
association of smaller generators, said that by avoiding the question of ba=
ck=20
debt, the PUC's move will do nothing to restore plants to operation.=20
"These generators will not come back online as a result of this decision,"=
=20
she said. "In fact, a greater number likely will have to drop offline."=20
Protesters chanting, "Hell no, we won't pay," urged consumers after the PUC=
=20
meeting to not include the higher fees in upcoming bills.=20
"This is just the beginning," said Medea Benjamin, who was among the=20
demonstrators evicted from the earlier proceedings. "Rates will go up and u=

The McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill faces several more tests,=

Amid the jeers of protesters yelling ``Hell, no, we won't pay,'' the PUC=20
voted unanimously Tuesday to approve electricity rate hikes of up to 46=20
percent for customers of California's two largest utilities.=20
The increases for Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edis=

``It's terrible, we will probably go out of business,'' Sahouria said. ``It=

PUC commissioners, who voted 5-0 for the rate hikes, said they were necessa=

However, the PUC simultaneously ordered the nearly bankrupt utilities to pa=

the state for billions of dollars of electricity it has bought on behalf of=

``The PUC has done all it can,'' commission president Loretta Lynch said.=
=20
``We have fought back hard in every venue possible against these unjust=20

Not all PG&E and Edison customers will face higher bills. The PUC said it=

No explanation given after officials approve 27 percent rate hike=20
Posted at 10:00 p.m. PST Tuesday, March 27, 2001=20
BY STEVE JOHNSON=20

Mercury News=20


After months of waiting for the state's elected leaders to act, California'=
s=20
Public Utilities Commission on Tuesday unanimously approved the largest=20
electricity rate increase in at least two decades, and offered no assurance=
s=20
that more hikes won't be needed soon.=20
The 3-cent per kilowatt-hour increase would boost average rates for all=20
customers by 27 percent, although the precise residential and business rate=
s=20
have yet to be determined. It is effective immediately and will show up on=
=20
bills in May.=20
The commission's vote in San Francisco played out against an odd political=
=20
backdrop: Gov. Gray Davis, who appointed three of its five members, said he=
=20
wasn't consulted about the planned rate hike and that he does not favor it.=
=20
But Davis, after learning Sunday night about the plan, apparently did not=
=20
seek to block the commission's action. Instead, he issued a statement=20
immediately after the vote that called it ``premature because we do not hav=
e=20
all the appropriate financial numbers necessary to make a decision. Until w=
e=20
do, I cannot support any rate increase.''=20
The commission, however, said it had no alternative but to raise rates,=20
considering that the state in recent weeks has been forced to spend billion=
s=20
in taxpayer funds on power because its cash-strapped utilities are no longe=
r=20
credit-worthy.=20
But even some commissioners were uneasy. Davis' most recent appointee on th=
e=20
commission, Geoffrey Brown, acknowledged during the Tuesday meeting that ``=
we=20
as commissioners had very little time to review this.''=20
In fact, an administrative law judge -- using much the same evidence that w=
as=20
included in the decision to raise rates -- had concluded recently that no=
=20
such increase was justified.=20
The commission did not explain how it arrived at the increase of 3 cents pe=
r=20
kilowatt-hour. Previously, officials with Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and=20
Southern California Edison had only sought a 2-cent per kilowatt-hour=20
increase.=20
Experts pointed to a number of unanswered questions that make it uncertain=
=20
whether a 3-cent hike will bring in sufficient revenue to cover the enormou=
s=20
cost the state has incurred since it began buying power.=20
The state still doesn't know how much its effort to bail out PG&E and Ediso=
n=20
-- which involves a state purchase of the utilities' high-voltage lines --=
=20
will cost. It's also unclear how much the state might wind up spending on t=
he=20
expensive electricity spot market this summer, and whether an additional ra=
te=20
increase would be needed to cover that.=20
``Have we got the number right?'' asked Commissioner Henry Duque, in=20
reference to the 3-cent increase. ``I don't know. But I hope we have.''=20
Roderick Wright, D-Los Angeles, who chairs the Assembly Utilities Committee=
,=20
told the commission that he opposed the idea of approving any rate hike now=
,=20
until the state has a better idea of the total amount that consumers=20
ultimately will have to bear.=20
By establishing a 3-cent increase now, ``we'll be back in a short time,=20
potentially doing it again,'' he said. ``To be nickeled and dimed to death =
as=20
we're doing here, I don't think that does anybody any good.''=20
Signs of confusion=20
Utility officials sounded similarly unimpressed and confused.=20
``While providing a welcome dose of realism,'' PG&E president Gordon Smith=
=20
said in a prepared statement, the rate hike and other actions taken by the=
=20
commission Tuesday ``do not offer a comprehensive solution, fail to resolve=
=20
the uncertainty of the crisis and may even create more instability.''=20
Among PG&E's major concerns is whether the utilities will be compensated fo=
r=20
their debts -- which they claim total about $13 billion -- and whether PG&E=
=20
or the state will be responsible for the cost of power purchased on the spo=
t=20
market.=20
Bruce Foster, an Edison vice president, offered a similar lukewarm=20
endorsement of the increase. ``I'm not saying that it will do it,'' he said=
,=20
acknowledging the possibility of more increases down the road, but he calle=
d=20
the hike ``a step in the right direction.''=20
Rate hike vs. bankruptcy=20
Commissioner Richard Bilas said he feared that if the utilities were forced=
=20
into bankruptcy, the judge overseeing such a case could order much bigger=
=20
rate hikes to stabilize the companies' finances.=20
``A rate increase designed by this commission is far better than one design=
ed=20
by a bankruptcy judge,'' Bilas said, adding that he also was concerned abou=
t=20
how the state appeared to be buying electricity ``like a drunken sailor.''=
=20
But others reacted angrily to the commission's decision. Several protesters=
=20
hoisted signs at the meeting that read, ``we won't pay'' and chanted, ``rat=
e=20
hikes go away, make the energy companies pay.'' Police later escorted them=
=20
out of the meeting after commission President Loretta Lynch became annoyed =
at=20
their noisy interruptions.=20
Instead of raising rates, they and other consumer advocates urged Davis to=
=20
use the state's power of eminent domain to take over the power plants=20
operated by companies accused of gouging the public.=20
``The governor should start seizing plants until these crooks start playing=
=20
by the rules of society,'' said Mike Florio, senior attorney with The Utili=
ty=20
Reform Network in San Francisco. ``They're economic war criminals.''=20
Officials in Davis' office said Tuesday that they intend to review the=20
commission's action and decide over the next few weeks whether to support i=
t=20
or seek changes. But to some people, the governor's claim of ignorance abou=
t=20
the commission's plan -- and his seeming inability to do anything to stop t=
he=20
rate hike from being approved -- severely strained credulity.=20
``Give me a break,'' said Sen. John Vasconcellos, D-San Jose. ``Who appoint=
ed=20
them and who's been giving orders all along?''=20
Davis did say for the first time Tuesday that he might be willing to consid=
er=20
having consumers pay more for electricity. ``If it becomes clear that a rat=
e=20
increase is absolutely necessary for the good of the state,'' he said, ``I=
=20
will support one that is fair.''=20

Impact of increases will vary greatly=20
Posted at 9:44 p.m. PST Tuesday, March 27, 2001=20
BY JOHN WOOLFOLK=20

Mercury News=20


The rate increases approved Tuesday will hit Californians in very different=
=20
ways: The heaviest users of electricity will probably pay the most, and=20
nearly half of residential users will likely see no increase at all.=20
Although the details aren't yet final, state regulators say they intend to=
=20
fashion a ``tiered structure'' to implement the higher rates. Here's how th=
e=20
proposal will affect your bill:=20
When do the higher rates kick in?=20
Regulators consider the increase effective immediately but say it won't=20
appear on bills until May. While regulators agreed that rates will rise, th=
ey=20
still have to approve a structure for how customers will share the cost.=20
Hearings are expected next month. Once the structure is approved, regulator=
s=20
say, utilities can apply it retroactively to Tuesday's rate approval.=20
Do the new rates affect all Californians?=20
No. The Public Utilities Commission, which approved the rate increase, has=
=20
authority over only investor-owned utilities: Pacific Gas & Electric Co.,=
=20
Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric, which together ser=
ve=20
about 10 million homes and businesses. The increase affects PG&E and Edison=
,=20
but not San Diego. Municipal utilities, including Santa Clara, Palo Alto,=
=20
Alameda, Sacramento and Los Angeles are governed independently and exempt.=
=20
How will the new rates work?=20
Regulators are planning a tiered rate structure in which large commercial a=
nd=20
power-guzzling residential customers pay a greater share. Residential=20
customers would pay more according to how much they exceed their ``baseline=
''=20
amount.=20
What is the baseline?=20
The baseline is considered the average household usage. It was established=
=20
years ago to encourage conservation by charging a higher rate for electrici=
ty=20
usage over that amount.=20
Does everybody have the same baseline?=20
No. Customers are assigned different baselines to account for variations in=
=20
electricity needs caused by regional climate, household type and season.=20
How many baselines are there?=20
PG&E residential customers in the San Francisco Bay Area are divided among=
=20
three climatic baseline territories: the coastal areas including San=20
Francisco and the Peninsula, the East Bay and South Bay, and the Santa Cruz=
=20
Mountains.=20
Within those territories, there are separate baselines for single-family=20
homes and multifamily apartment complexes, as well as for homes with only=
=20
electric appliances instead of both gas and electric.=20
In addition, baseline rates are adjusted for summer and winter usage. Summe=
r=20
rates begin May 1, and winter rates begin Nov. 1.=20
How do I find out my baseline?=20
Your electric bill shows the baseline amount in kilowatt-hours and the rate=
=20
you are billed for that amount. It also shows how much power you used over=
=20
the baseline and the rate you were billed for it.=20
How does the baseline affect my bill?=20
Customers already pay about 14 percent more for power they use over their=
=20
baseline. Under the proposed tiered rates, PG&E customers who use no more=
=20
than 130 percent of their baseline amount wouldn't pay any more than they d=
o=20
now. PG&E customers who use up to twice their baseline would see an average=
 9=20
percent increase in monthly bills. Those who use more than twice their=20
baseline would see an average increase of 36 percent. Edison customers woul=
d=20
have similar rates. Almost half of the utilities' customers don't exceed 13=
0=20
percent of their baseline.=20
Why am I hearing different reports about the size of the rate increase?=20
The increase can be calculated many ways. The commission approved an increa=
se=20
of 3 cents a kilowatt-hour, three times the 1-cent surcharge approved in=20
January, which was made permanent Tuesday. Because the 1-cent increase=20
averaged 10 percent, some have said that, plus the 3 cents, amounts to a=20
40-percent increase.=20
Others have added 3 cents to the amount the utilities charge just for=20
electricity, which for PG&E is now 6.4 cents, and come up with a 47-percent=
=20
increase.=20
Because total rates include transmission and maintenance surcharges, others=
=20
have added 3 cents to the average total rate of 11.14 cents for all=20
customers, a 27-percent increase. Under the tiered proposal, the average=20
residential rate would rise 20.8 percent from 12.46 cents to 15.05 cents.=
=20
But average bills for residents' bills would increase up to 36 percent,=20
depending on electricity use.=20
Can my business avoid the rate hike by saving energy?=20
The proposed tiered rate structure based on the baseline use doesn't apply =
to=20
commercial and industrial businesses. In fact, the proposal calls for a=20
proportionately greater increase for businesses, which pay lower rates than=
=20
residential customers. Commercial customers would see a 22.6-percent=20
increase. Industrial customers, generally over 500 kilowatt-hours a month,=
=20
would see a 41-percent increase.=20
But businesses can still get a discount on summer bills by saving power. Go=
v.=20
Gray Davis this month ordered 20-percent rebates for all customers who redu=
ce=20
electricity usage 20 percent over last year between June and September.=20
Residential and small commercial rebates will be based on 20 percent=20
reduction of total consumption, while commercial and industrial rebates wil=
l=20
be based on 20 percent reduction of peak load.=20
If I qualify for assistance in paying my bills now, will I have to pay more=
?=20
Possibly. The proposal calls for exempting customers in the California=20
Alternative Rates for Energy program, and expanding eligibility from 150=20
percent to 175 percent of federal poverty guidelines. But commissioners=20
aren't ruling out tiered rates for those customers to encourage them to sav=

electricity.=20

Energy payments not enough, gas-using generators say=20

The Orange County Register=20
Natural-gas-dependent alternative generators say that even if the major=20

State regulators at the Public Utilities Commission on Tuesday ordered=20
Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric to start paying=20
alternative-energy producers $79 per megawatt-hour. But alternative=20
generators that use natural gas say that's at least $20 below what it costs=

Alternative generators have been paid little, or nothing, the past four=20

The situation has prompted many of the small generators to scale back or sh=

March 28, 2001=20
By JOHN HOWARD
The Orange County Register=20
SACRAMENTO Gov. Gray Davis shifted his position opposing electricity rate=
=20
hikes, saying he would support them "if it becomes clear it is absolutely=
=20
necessary for the good of the state."=20
The governor's statement Tuesday came just hours after the Public Utilities=
=20
Commission, a panel controlled by Davis' appointees, endorsed a plan to rai=
se=20
monthly bills by as much 36 percent. The increase eventually would be tied =
to=20
a flexible rating plan in which light users will pay a little more, medium=
=20
users (those who conserve energy) will pay moderately more, and heavy users=
=20
will pay a lot more. Details of the plan are not yet set.=20
Davis called the PUC's decision "premature," saying scant information was=
=20
available to justify increases.=20
"While I have opposed rate increases, if it becomes clear a rate increase i=
s=20
absolutely necessary for the good of the state, I will support one that is=
=20
fair and do my duty to convince Californians of its necessity," Davis said.=
=20
Boosting electricity rates to help resolve California's energy crisis is=20
likely to increase the state's $10 billion revenue bond sale to $12 billion=
=20
or more, entailing more interest charges and a longer payback.=20
Standard and Poor's, the Wall Street credit-rating agency, called the ratin=
g=20
plan "a complicated formula that will only increase rates on heavy users of=
=20
electricity."=20
"It is unclear exactly how many users will be affected, and whether revenue=
s=20
will slip under the rate-raising formula as consumers respond by conserving=
=20
electricity," S&P said.=20
Also unclear is how the money from increased rates would be divided. The=20
state, which has been buying power on behalf of the utilities, says it has=
=20
first rights to the money. The utilities have challenged that.=20
California hopes to borrow $10 billion by selling revenue bonds in May to=
=20
cover its costs of purchasing emergency electricity since December. Through=
=20
April 7, those costs are expected to total $4.2 billion.=20
The bond money also will be used to pay for power under long-term contracts=
,=20
which is much cheaper than power bought just before it is used.=20
Critics have questioned whether $10 billion will be sufficient. PUC Preside=
nt=20
Loretta Lynch said the increased rates would support at least a $12 billion=
=20
bond sale. Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio and Joseph Fichera, a Davis fisca=

Conserve and save=20
A proposed tiered-billing format is designed to spare low power users from=
=20
the rate increases. Baseline is the bottom line.=20
March 28, 2001=20
By ANNE C. MULKERN
and KATE BERRY
The Orange County Register=20
The state's power crisis hit your wallet Tuesday when state regulators hike=
d=20
electricity rates as much as 36 percent.=20
Your bill could be headed up as a result. Here are answers to some of your=
=20
questions about the rate hike:=20
Q: How much more will I pay?=20
A: Details of the plan haven't been finalized. But the idea is to create a=
=20
three-level rate structure. Those who use more electricity will pay the=20
highest rates and those who conserve will save.=20
Consumers who use less than l30 percent of their baseline power allocation=
=20
will escape any increase. (We explain baseline below.)=20
The rate increase will be distributed across the two higher tiers. The Publ=
ic=20
Utilities Commission over the next 30 days will come up with a plan to=20
determine exact rates for the two higher levels, as well as for different=
=20
types of customers, such as residential and small business.=20
Q: So what is baseline?=20
A: Baseline is the portion of your usage considered necessary for essential=
s.=20
To encourage conservation, it's set below the amount most people use.=20
The percentage of Edison customers who use less than 130 percent of baselin=
e=20
is roughly 48 percent in winter months and 45 percent in the summer.=20
Because baseline is set based on the average household's use, it means a=20
single person living in an apartment can have the same baseline as a=20
homeowner with four children.=20
Baseline varies depending on where you live. Warmer areas get higher=20
baselines. There are different baselines for the summer and winter. People=
=20
who use medical equipment in their homes can get higher baseline allocation=
s.=20
All-electric homes get higher baselines.=20
Q: What's the reason for this rate hike? Are they really doing this to get=
=20
people to conserve?=20
A: Conservation is a side benefit. The primary motivation is money.=20
The state has already shelled out $3 billion buying power in the last three=
=20
months for customers of the near-insolvent utilities.=20
The state plans to issue bonds, which will be paid for by consumers, to cov=
er=20
the power purchases. But Wall Street bankers must have proof of a steady=20
revenue stream - a rate increase - to convince them the bonds can be repaid=
.=20
However, people inevitably will conserve if they are paying more for their=
=20
power, so the plan will also help reduce demand.=20
Q: I'm already conserving. How can I cut my bill further?=20
A: It's nitty-gritty time. Replace your incandescent light bulbs with=20
fluorescent bulbs. Clean those coils at the back of your refrigerator. Turn=
=20
your air conditioner down or off. Reduce the amount of time you use your po=
ol=20
pump.=20
Many items in your house use electricity when they are plugged in, even if=
=20
they're not in use. You can cut consumption by unplugging your television,=
=20
computer, coffeepot, toaster and blow dryer.=20
Q. When will I pay the increase?=20
A: The rate hike takes effect immediately. But it could take Southern=20
California Edison a month to 45 days to implement it, so you could face=20
retroactive charges on a follow-up bill.=20
Q. I live in south Orange County and buy electricity from San Diego Gas &=
=20
Electric Co. Does this plan affect me?=20
A: No. SDG&E has applied for a rate increase, but state regulators have not=
=20
yet voted on that request.=20
Q. I'm outraged. We didn't ask for deregulation and now we're paying more.=
=20
How can I protest?=20
A: Call or write you state lawmakers and the governor. You can also join on=
e=20

But even people who use small amounts of power and do not see their rates=
=20

price increases.=20
Before the rate increases, power costs in California were slightly higher=

Calif. Regulators Raise Power Rates

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ As protesters jeered ``Hell, no, we won't pay!''=20

For the rate increase, the commission said it will create a tiered system=

The rate increase will be on top of the 9 percent to 15 percent hike approv=

by the PUC in January, and a 10 percent increase already scheduled for next=

Ratepayers and consumer groups branded the latest plan a rip-off.=20

Democratic Gov. Gray Davis has said that he opposes rate increases but that=

he has no power over the PUC. However, three of the PUC members are his=20

Residents already pay about $65 per month for electricity _ 7.2 cents per=

The latest rate hike would mean a 42 percent increase for SoCal Edison=20
customers and 46 percent for PG&E customers for electricity alone. Since th=

Spokesmen for both utilities said it is impossible to calculate how much th=
