Hello, members of the RTO West Stage 2 Tariff Integration  Group.
?
Like so many of you, I seem to be in a perpetual state of  triage these 
days.? I apologize it has taken me so long to follow up on our  meeting of 
February 7, but at last I have prepared a summary of the various  assignments 
and tasks we identified at that meeting.
?
Attached for your reference is a "work tracking document"  with the 
information from the February 7 meeting.
?
The work tracking document (along with various other  materials posted since 
the February 7 meeting) is on the RTO West Website  at:

?
Thank you very much!
