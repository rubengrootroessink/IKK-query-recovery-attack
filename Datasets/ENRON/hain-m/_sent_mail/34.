seeks information that is not relevant and (2) seeks information that is 
unduly burdensome to produce.  (Rules of Procedure Governing Rate Hearings, 
Section 1010.8(b).)  WPAG further objects to this Data Request on the grounds 
that it is in improper form, as it does not cite to specific testimony or 
indicate the specific use to which to information sought will be put,  
(Special Rules of Practice, WP-02-O-01.)and was received after the deadline 
for submission of data requests.  Without waiving the foregoing objections,
