No we're not interested in intervening.  This filing is to carry out the 
settlement I negotiated.  I'm the person on the floor who is familiar with 
the services we purchase.

Lysa,

Please view the attachment and download the BPA tariff filing to the p: drive 
and let me know where it is.  If you have trouble downloading fromt the FERC 
site, try BPA (my guess is that it will be easier to get from BPA than 
through FERC).

This can wait until next week.


Thank you,

Alan Comnes

Apparently BPA is filing for new transmission and A/S  rates effective 
10/1/01.  Is there an interest in:

intervening? (I assume no)
getting a copy of the filing? (I assume yes)

Who on our floor is familar with the BPA transmission and A/S services we 
currently purchase?

Alan:

See the first notice regarding BPA

Dan, Dan and Tom:

See the last notice on GridFlorida regarding comments on the revised RTO 
filing due on January 5.  As you know, we've joined in a group asking for an 
extension until February 6 (or at least January 30).  FERC has not acted on 
the request yet.
