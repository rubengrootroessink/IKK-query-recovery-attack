Yes we do care.  The question is: are we going to do anything?  Robin and 
Richard will be discussing this this afternoon.

The CPUC's motion only applied to the generators, not the ISO.  I guess the 
ISO was viewed as cooperating.

The ISO plans to comply with recent EOB and CPUC subpoenas unless FERC or a 
court tells them not to.  DO we care about this?

Question for  Mary and Ron -- Are they trying to get around the FERC-- given 
the CPUC's filing there asking for authority to get info?

Also, as Mary is aware, the WPTF will be submitting a protest to SCE's 
request to FERC to have the ISO's MSC release data to SCE that the MSC claims 
identify those who have abused market power.

To Market Participants and Scheduling Coordinators:

The CA ISO believes it has complied with its obligations under CA ISO Tariff
section 20.3.4 as to the December 4 EOB subpoena and the September 21 CPUC
subpoena.  Our reasoning is explained in the attached letter.  Accordingly,
the CA ISO will comply with the EOB and  CPUC subpoenas on December 20
unless it receives and order to the contrary from a court or the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission.

In addition, the CA ISO has received requests from the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission and the state agencies for information on generator
unit outages.  This information is not subject to tariff section 20.3.4
which protects only Generator Outage programs.  Nonetheless, the CA ISO is
providing this notice as a curtesy matter.  The CA ISO will provide the
requested information to FERC and the state agencies.  The CA ISO has in the
past requested confidential treatment for information on the cause of an
outage and projected in service date since this information could be used by
Market Participants to manipulate the market, and it will make such a
request as to cause and in service dates in the context of the current
requests.

Jeanne M. Sol,
Regulatory Counsel
California ISO
