Sue, etal --

Not sure if you had seen this.  How should we follow these issues (people, 
time, etc.)?  Is this important?  I'd appreciate any comments.

Jim

Attached is a summary of the California FTR product, how to schedule, and
the timeline.  To access the issues around the Seams between California,
Northwest, and the Southwest, we need to understand the FTR characteristics
for all the three RTOs.  This is a starting point for discussion during next
weeks conference call and the Dec meeting.
