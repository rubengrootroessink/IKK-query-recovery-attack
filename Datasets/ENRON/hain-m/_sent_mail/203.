Joshua:    Your boss did a great job yesterday and I thought the exchange 
between Steve Kean and he was very effective.  We would love to work with you 
and would be happy to draft some legislative language for your consideration 
which would address the issue.  Plus, I can be helpful in gaining bipartisan 
support for the provision.  Have you discussed this with Valerie at all?  
Since Tim Beldon in our Oregon office has met with Ronnie Euchas on 
disclosure, I want to include him on the drafting.  Thus, it might take me a 
day or two longer to get something to you.  Hopefully, I can have something 
drafted by Monday and I'll call you to see if I can come up and meet with you 
to discuss the draft lanuage, strategy, next steps, etc.  Thanks.

Cynthia,

Thanks for getting me the Q&As for the hearing.  Senator Wyden is interested 
in
following up on the issue of electricity information disclosure and would like
to work with Enron on this.  I would appreciate any input you could provide on
how best to go about this through legislation, what sort of information should
be disclosed, to whom and when, whether financial information as well as
operating information should be included, and any suggestions for a Republican
on the Committee who you think would be good for Senator Wyden to work with on
legislation.

Thanks again for your help and I look forward to working with you further on
this.

- Joshua
