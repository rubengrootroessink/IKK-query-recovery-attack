Here's the right version.  I've deleted the earlier version.  Sorry about any 
confusion.

Thanks for sending the letter along.  I forwarded it to Mitch Taylor for his 
information and review.  I'm comfortable sending the letter (assuming Mitch 
agrees).  I want to call Steve Oldham first and warn him of the problem.  

I am uncomfortable taking any further formal action at least until we have a 
meeting with Sierra on the PGE transaction that was scheduled for this week 
and may take place next week.    Do we have any idea on what further delay is 
costing us (i.e., $__/month)?

Priscilla

Attached find a letter to Sierra Pacific about our transmission and 
interconnection requests.  Due to Nevada Power's dilatory tactics to date and 
the pendancy of financing for the project, Ed, Don, Stan, Jim G., and I agree 
that the letter takes the necessary tone and should ask Sierra to file with 
FERC the agreements (unexecuted) if Sierra doesn't give EPMI an executable 
contracts by 2/28/01.  If we are going to make this demand we need to send 
this letter ASAP.
