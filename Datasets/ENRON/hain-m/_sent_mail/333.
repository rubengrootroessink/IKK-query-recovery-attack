> sought by other parties served.  Third, the Commission has filed its
> motion before FERC seeking an order compelling the production of the data
> from those other parties that have objected and seeking an expedited
> hearing and production schedule.  We note that the reasons stated in the
> motion before FERC as the basis for the production are materially
> different than the reasons originally stated in the ex parte application
> to the Commission's own Administrative Law Judge who issued the subpoenas.
> Finally, FERC itself has completed its investigation and has issued a
