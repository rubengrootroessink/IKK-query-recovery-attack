Subject: Chairman Hoecker Tenders Resignation Effective Jan. 18

At the FERC Commission meeting this morning, Chairman Hoecker announced his 
resignation from the Commission effective January 18.  

Other Items at the Meeting:
Hoecker summarized the meetings that occurred last night with Cal. Gov. 
Davis, Energy Sec. Richardson, Clinton Administration officials and industry 
representatives.  He said that the parties had produced a statement of 
principles on resolving the Calif. issues.  Specifically, he mentioned that 
the principles include a discussion of the regional nature of the market.
Order on GridFlorida.   When GridFlorida made its RTO filing, they asked the 
Commission for an expedited order providing guidance on certain independence 
and governance matters.  This order provides guidance on:
The process for selecting the RTO board
The process for selecting a CEO and directors
Rules for financial holdings by RTO board members.
Items Struck form Agenda:  The Commission did not act on Illinois Power's 
requests to leave the Midwest ISO or the Alliance second RTO  filing.  
Commissioner Massey criticized the Commission for being slow to act on these 
items.  He said that at the heart of both of these filings is the issue of 
scope/configuration of RTOs.   He shared his belief that the Midwest must be 
treated on a regional basis.
El Paso v. CPUC complaint.  This proceeding involves CPUC's complaint that 
affiliate El Paso Merchant is improperly hoarding El Paso Natural Gas 
capacity to California.   The Commission did not discuss the draft order.  
However, Hebert noted that he had dissented from the order.
