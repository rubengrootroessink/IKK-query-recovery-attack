I am going to be the Senior Regulatory Counsel at ISO New England starting on 
April 9, 2001.   My last day in the Portland area will be March 31, 2001.  I 
enjoyed working with you and wish you the best of everything.  I'm having a 
pot luck at my house Friday, if you and Steve want to come over. 

My new address will be:

Mary Hain
Senior Regulatory Counsel
ISO New England Inc.
One Sullivan Road
Holyoke, MA  01040-2841
