RE: NERC Summit
      ? Wednesday, April 18, at 10 a.m.

The NERC Board of Trustees is scheduled to have a very important meeting on 
Friday, March 30th, on the future organization of NERC-the so-called "NERC to 
NAERO transition."  NERC is poised to eliminate its traditional board 
structure, long dominated by its regional councils, and adopt an independent 
board along with some form of a stakeholder advisory committee.  This 
watershed event provides an opportunity for EPSA, and its member companies, 
to carefully evaluate participation in NERC, its committees and the 
activities in the regions.

Specifically, we want to focus on what matters, if any, NERC is presently 
addressing that warrant the continued attention and participation of EPSA 
and/or its members.  For those issues that are affecting, or could 
potentially affect, the business interests of EPSA's members, what is the 
most efficient and effective role EPSA could play?  What is the best forum 
for resolving reliability-related technical issues beyond FERC's expertise?

To facilitate this discussion, EPSA will be hosting a half-day summit to 
discuss the outcome of NERC's March 30th meeting and its implications for 
EPSA's allocation of resources to NERC activities on Wednesday, April 18 at 
10 a.m.  We encourage members to attend in person at the new EPSA offices at 
1401 New York Ave., 11th Floor, Washington, D.C.  However, we will also make 
participation by conference call available.  We encourage all companies, 
whether or not they are currently active in NERC, to participate in this 
important meeting.

Please RSVP for the meeting using the form below to Jackie Gallagher either 
by fax (202-628-8260) or e-mail (jgallagher@epsa.org).
