Rick --

I agree with Mary that it may make sense if this guy is able to be on at our 
next meeting (if space/time permits).  If it's ok, maybe Ginger can work with 
Mary to arrange.

Jim

This is not public information yet but, assuming Tim gives his final okay, a 
guy will be joining the trading floor to develop a renewable market including 
a portfolio, trading, an index, auction, an Enron Online product, etc.  He 
wants to formulate a well developed regulatory policy approach and has agreed 
to draft up some bullet points for our use and has had preliminary meetings 
with various groups in Houston including Jeff Keeler.  He also wants to 
enlist the assistance of government affairs.  I suggested he do a 
presentation at our next government affairs meeting.  Are we still having 
people do presentations at our meetings?  Could we fit him in?
