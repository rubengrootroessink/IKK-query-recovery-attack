I hope you caught Lysa's error in transcribing this message.  I said you 
should say, "It doesn't mean the FERC has not accepted 
a rate or that a rate isn't on file.  Sorry about the double negative.  FERC 
usually speaks in terms of "accepting" rates rather 
than "setting" rates unless it has had a hearing and found that the rates 
being charged are unjust and unreasonable..

Robin & Jeff:

Mary Hain asked that I advise you she had one change to the information she 
gave you yesterday.  

Instead of saying, "It doesn't mean the FERC hasn't set a rate..."
you should say, "It doesn't mean the FERC has accepted a rate and that a rate 
isn't on file".

If you have any questions about this, you can contact Mary on her cell phone 
(503/807-0928) AFTER 12:45pm Cnetral Time.
