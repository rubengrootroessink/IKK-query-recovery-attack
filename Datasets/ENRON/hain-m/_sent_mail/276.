According to the guys on the desk, EPMI has 5-10 end user customers in 
Montana (for example Smurfit, Stone and others).

FYI.  We have to make this filing and EPMI East has no retail customers.  
Thresa said the west does not either.  We will make the filing from here.  
Thanks.

We should only be including end user sales on the report.

Depends.  Is EPMI making the sales to the UI end users, or is UI?  If the 
former and if it constitutes one of your 20 largest sales not for resale, 
then it must be included.

Dan -- Do we need to include our UI deal on this filing now for 2000?
Thanks.
