In addition to the ISO derating its own available transmission capacity 
(exporting) at the California Oregon Border (so that people can't buy 
transmission from the ISO to export power) the ISO is now threatening to cut 
our exports from California using transmission rights that we have purchased 
from a muni that is not part of the ISO's grid.
