Is EES asking for too much here (especially extending the rate freeze)? =20
Wouldn't it be better to get this thing resolved (assuming that's possible)=
?

Jim.  I like your suggestions and suggest the following enhancements:
We should integrate this solution into the CPUC process. ie Keep rate freez=
e=20
in effect until the Mar 02.  Make state agency take over as ESP to all=20
bundled customers at 110% of frozen rate.  This solution keeps the current=
=20
Rate Freeze in place and keeps us in the game to not lose our negative ctc.=
 =20
It also corresponds to your minimal changes goal.  It also puts government=
=20
agency in the same place as us in having exposure to negative ctc as us.  I=
t=20
also accomodates the problem of RFP's taking longer than expected.  It also=
=20
solves the liquidity problem immediately and avoids the need for=20
forbearance.  And furthermore it keeps the utility exposed to bankruptcy=20
which minimizes their negotiating power.
I don't understand how this proposal addreses what happens with the existin=
g=20
assets of PG&E.  The worry I have is that PG&E gets to keep 50% of the=20
benefits of nuclear sales and 10% of the benefits of hydro sales, post rate=
=20
freeze.  If we damage 1890, the utilities are now in the drivers seat.
re "ESPs should be able to buy from UDCs at the current weighted average=20
generation rate from 1/1/01 =01) 12/31/02 to serve any competitive load in=
=20
California"  This suggest a replacement to AB 1890 which suggests significa=
nt=20
changes.  Would it not be better to say "After the rate freeze, the=20
government entity would take over the obligations of PG&E and continue them=

Attached please find three documents that outlines the economics of LT=20

Call me with any questions.

Great idea.  My strategy was solve the immediate problem of solvency quickl=

by getting the government to step in while the rules of the RFP are defined=

then do the auction, but if you think we could go straight to an RFP for=20

I believe that we do not have time for an RFP (6 months) so that we should=

get the government entity to step in to give us the time.

And auction by rate class would be good but noone would want the large=20
classes because their rate increase will be higher and they will be less=20
likely to stay.

What about something different?

If we asked for an Auction by rate class that would allow a different compa=
ny=20
to market the default service.  The competitive bids would be used to reduc=
e=20
the overall undercollection.  So in your ST point #1, replace Government=20
entity with a Competitive ESP that has paid the most to win that right.
