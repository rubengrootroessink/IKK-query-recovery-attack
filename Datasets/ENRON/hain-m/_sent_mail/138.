Greetings, members of the RTO West Stage 2 Tariff  Integration Group.
?
This e-mail is just to let you know that two items posted  last week on the 
Tariff Integration Group page on the RTO West Website  
(http://208.55.67.64/Stage2TariffIntGrpMain.htm)  have been updated to 
incorporate section headings related to Generation  Interconnection and 
Integration.? The two documents are the Tariff outline  and the tariff 
working document.? Thank you Connie Westadt for providing  the generator 
section headings!
?
I have also posted a draft agenda for our Wednesday  (February 21) meeting.
?
We hope to post a revised draft of the "Description of RTO  West Services" as 
soon as it is available.
?
Thank you, and 'see you all Wednesday!
