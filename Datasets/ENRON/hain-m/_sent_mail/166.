AReM Team:

Here is report from Hertzberg news conference:

Democratic Caucus announced a package of bills to increase the supply of
electricity and cut down on demand through energy efficiency.

The package being introduced will produce more than 750 megawatts and save
1,200 megawatts over the next few years. 

Said the energy efficiency package may save as many as 500 megawatts,
equivalent to a new power plant. 

Demos presented a four bill package aimed at rapidly increasing and
stabilizing the supply of power available to the demands of residents and
businesses. The bills would:

Provide $50 million to establish an incentive program to encourage business
to install clean and modern on-site generation.

Provide $150 million to develop clean and efficient renewable energy supply 

Allow plants up to 100 megawatts to be cityby local government andnot
through Energy Commission review 

Ensure power by requiring new power plants to enter into purchasing
agreements with the state. 

They also introduced five bills to provide funding to" 

Replace energy inefficient appliances like refrigerators and air
conditioners; 
Give schools grants and loans to decrease consumption 
Provide 50 percent grants and 50 percent loans to local governments to
retrofit buildings; 
Establish a Mobile Efficiency Brigade with $100 million in grants to
nonprofits to hire a team of people to distribute low-energy lightbulbs to
residences, saving 125 megawatts, but help other conservation programs get
started twell before the summer by providig people to do the work while
learning new skills.
