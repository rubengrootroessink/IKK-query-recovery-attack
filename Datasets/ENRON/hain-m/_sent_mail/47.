WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Bush nominated Pennsylvania Public Utility
Commissioner Nora Mead Brownell to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on
Tuesday.
Brownell, a member of the state panel since 1997, would serve on the federal
commission through 2006 if confirmed by the Senate.
The five-member Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulates wholesale power
markets and interstate natural gas pipelines.
During her time on the state commission, Brownell helped oversee
Pennsylvania's electricity deregulation, which has been praised as a national
model.
She has supported research into renewable sources of energy and was
instrumental in having the commission create a $21 million fund to be used for
investment in clean energy projects including wind, solar and biogas ventures.
The 53-year-old native of Erie, Pa., previously served as executive director
of the Regional Performing Arts Center in Philadelphia and was a senior vice
president of Meridian Bancorp Inc. She attended Syracuse University.
