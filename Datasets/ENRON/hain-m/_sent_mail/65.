We're flying back East on Sunday.  You are invited to come over Friday 
evening, if you like.  Some of our other friends have asked to get together 
so we're inviting people for pot luck.  we'll supply the beer.  Feel free to 
bring your mom too. Or we could do something else, before Sunday.

You're welcome.  I talked to Janet last night - would you and Pete be able to
make dinner at our house next weekend - perhaps Sunday night?  dn

Hi,

Over the past weeks, I have been staying at home with my new daughter (a
picture is attached, though it does not do her justice).  Monday, March 12,
I intend to return to the office.

My sense is that Paul Mohler has been doing a fine job running the rate
case.  I hope you agree -- if not, please tell me.  I intend to start
reintegrating myself into the RTO West/TransConnect work, and will call to
discuss -- I'm writing now to get you thinking about it.

Stan
