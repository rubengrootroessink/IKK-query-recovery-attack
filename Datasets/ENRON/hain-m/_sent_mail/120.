Gary Porter of Sierra called.  He was very apologetic about not sending us an 
interconnection agreement sooner.  Attached is a draft that has not been 
reviewed by Sierra's executives yet, but I talked Gary into giving it to us 
anyway.  

Concerning our transmission request, Gary indicated that Sierra will have to 
perform a study because some other parties are supposedly ahead of us in the 
queue that would affect the available transmission capacity.  He referred me 
to a table on the following OASIS cite showing the competing transmission 
requests.  Stan or Don - please look at this table to see if you think 
Sierra's position has any merits.  I'll give you more details in person.  
Some tariff interpretation issues may also be involved depending upon whether 
other parties are actually ahead of us in the queue.
