Steve Walton has suggested the following definitions concepts for definitions 
of "Congestion Zone" and "Flowpath"

Congestion Zone - Segment of Electric System within which there is minimal 
congestion between busses.

Flowpath - A facility or set of facilities that represent commercially 
significant constraints within the transmission system.

As we discussed, Steve affirmed that these are terms of art.
