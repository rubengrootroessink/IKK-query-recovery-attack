I'm looking into whether we have to make a filing for EES too.

Dan,
At some point in the incremental meltdown of the PX process, perhaps when we 
default on payment of the large chargeback bill we will receive today or 
tomorrow and the PX takes our remaining collateral, the question will 
suddenly be:  how does one make sure one is not the last man standing?  It 
would seem that if it is possible to ever become a  "former"   participant in 
the PX and not a "current" one, ("current" being  the word used in the tariff 
to describe who the chargebacks go to) that we would have had, at a minimum, 
to have given notice of termination of our participation in both the Core and 
CTS markets.  Please review this documentation and help us prepare for a 
possible extradited extraction from the PX.  Thanks.----cgy

I have attached ready-to-file drafts of the letters necessary to terminate 
EPMI's Participation Agreement with the CalPX.  In addition to the letter to 
the CalPX, I am reasonably certain that a FERC filing is required to 
terminate the Participation Agreement because it is a power purchase/sale 
agreement, the form of which is on file with FERC.  Just to be safe I 
prepared the transmittal letter, notice of termination, and notice of filing 
necessary to file with FERC.  Among other things, I requested waiver of the 
60-day notice period.

I'll wait for further instruction before doing anything else on this matter.

Steve
