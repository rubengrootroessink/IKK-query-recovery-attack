I heard through the grapevine that you have concerns about what we are doing.

Just to clarify:  We are planning to file on 3/22 in response to the ISO's 
filing to continue to calculate but not charge the penalty.  We will oppose 
the ISO and ask that the ISO charge it.

We are not going to withdraw our previous filing in support of the utilities.

If you have any concerns, please contact me before the end of today.  Or I 
can set up a conference call if you like.
