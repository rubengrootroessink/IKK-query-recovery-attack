Month-Long Trial of Transmission Week -- No Cost

The most important -- and most unpredictable -- piece of today's electric
power market?

Easy. Transmission. It's confusing, complex, and troublesome to follow. Add
in the secondary markets, and things become even more complicated.

But now there's TRANSMISSION WEEK -- and you can try it for 4 weeks risk
FREE!

TRANSMISSION WEEK is an electronic newsletter from the publishers of
Megawatt Daily, Generation Week, Gas Daily, and other top energy
publications. It will keep you informed on every regional transmission
organization -- what's working and what's not.

Get the lowdown on settlement systems, bidding rules, price caps, generation
interconnections, seams issues, and other controversies. TRANSMISSION WEEK
makes sense out of new and evolving markets for transmission rights and
congestion contracts.

It keeps you up to speed on:

* New transmission line projects and how they'll change the markets.
* Merchant transmission lines and private transmission companies.
* Security coordination and reliability initiatives.
* Transmission outages.
* Secondary markets.
* Enabling agreements and terms.
* Pricing schemes.
* Forecasting and seasonal transmission availability.
* FERC policies, plus transmission disputes there and at the state
commissions.
* OASIS developments.
* New varieties of firm and non-firm services, and how they compare.
* Technology developments to ease transmission bottlenecks.
