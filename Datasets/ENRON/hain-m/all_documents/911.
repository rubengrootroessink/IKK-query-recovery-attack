  ISO Market Participants:
  Governor Gray Davis has identified a goal of bringing an
additional 1,000 megawatts of new peaking resources on line to meet summer
2001 demand across the state of California.  The California Department of
Water Resources (CDWR) intends to purchase a significant amount of capacity
and associated energy from these new resources.  In order to help identify
potential new resources and describe the means available to accelerate the
schedule for development of these resources, CDWR in cooperation with the
Governor's office, has scheduled a workshop with key representatives of
state agencies and the investor owned utilities.  The workshop will be on
March 15, 2001 from 2:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. at the Doubletree Hotel in
Sacramento and will be followed by a reception/networking session.
  Attached is the agenda for this meeting along with sources
of additional information.
