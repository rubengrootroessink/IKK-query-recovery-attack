In discussions with Ruth Bennett at BPA's Transmission Business Line this 
morning I learned that BPA is entertaining imposing a moratorium on ALL new 
requests for System Impact Studies and Requests to Reserve Transmission. BPA 
indicated they have over 33,000 MW's of such studies and requests in the 
queue and are overwhelmed at this point. They have got to put the skids on 
this quickly. 

On a related matter, BPA does not presently draw a distinction between 
connecting small generating units (1-25 MW) from the larger generating 
projects. They do understand the importance of allowing small units to get 
connected for production as early as this summer. Unfortunately, at this 
point they are obligated to take all requests on a first-come, first-serve 
basis. 

The Washington PUD Association has scheduled a meeting with BPA at SeaTac 
this Friday at 2 p.m. to discuss this situation. If anyone on this list wants 
to attend that meeting I will get more details. In the mean time, if your 
thinking of putting generation on the Northwest Federal transmission Network 
any time in the next few years, you should not delay applying to BPA.
