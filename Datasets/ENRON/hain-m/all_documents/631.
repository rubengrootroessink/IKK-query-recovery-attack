I submitted the following RCRs for CA:
Intervention in Support of Strategic Energy
Enron supported Strategic's complaint against the CA ISO, regarding its 
request to require the ISO release OOM (out of market) data publicly. ENA 
(Tim Belden) has always had as a number one priority, release more data 
sooner, and this filing offered an opportunity promote that concept.  The 
filing was made on 3/20/01.

Opposition to ISO Compliance Filing On Creditworthiness Standards
The ISO made a compliance filing that greatly expands its creditworthiness 
exemptions, far beyond what FERC had ordered in its 2/14/01 order.  The ISO's 
tariff language can be read to allow the utilities to count the credit status 
of third parties as their own, without the third parties' approvals.  Enron 
will oppose.  The filing is due 3/22/01.

Also Bracewell is making or has made the following CA filings (these are all 
I know about anyway):

Tucson Electric Complaint   Intervention -- vanilla 3/19   Done for Sanders 
-- no RCR
PNM Complaint   Support   3/22 Done for Sanders -- no RCR
FERC Staff Report  Support EPSA/WPTF 3/22 Plan to do for <$500
      and raise temporal issue of western resources
City of San Diego  Intervene/comment 3/28 Probably will be done for Sanders

The underscheduling filing was put on hold.  We were mistaken when we thought 
that comments on an ISO proposal were due 3/22.   Instead, we've now decided 
to file comments in response to the ISO's filing of tariff changes, which 
should be made soon.

That's all for the rest of March, so far.  I'll be updating Jim's table on 
pending FERC matters.
