Today, I am pleased to announce Factiva.com, the capstone of  our content=
=20
integration products and the powerful new service that will replace  Dow=20
Jones Interactive and Reuters Business Briefing.

You're going to see  some amazing new features in Factiva.com. Many of thes=
e=20
have been driven by the  results of a global research program that included=
=20
input from 300 global customers  and prospects, who also provided feedback =
at=20
every stage of our interface design  process.

What's the result? A new, innovative product that addresses your  need for=
=20
both global and local information. By building upon the DJI and RBB content=
 =20
sets we've created a unique global collection of nearly 8,000 sources from=
=20
118  countries in 22 languages. Through Factiva Intelligent Indexing, we've=
=20
addressed  the need to provide more granular coding. We've also improved=20
power searching,  and concentrated on the personalization and ease of use=
=20
that end users demand  =0F- all to make retrieval more accurate and relevan=
t.=20

The research also  identified that up to 40% of your time is spent assembli=
ng=20
and disseminating information,  so we've designed tools to make these steps=
=20
faster. In an enterprise product you  needed to be able to manage group=20
access to information, so we've added powerful  administration tools.=20

Because Factiva.com redefines how business people  gather the critical fact=
s=20
they need to make good business decisions we believe  you'll want to upgrad=
e=20
to it quickly. We will continue to support DJI and RBB,  but eventually we=
=20
will phase out these products as we devote all of our resources  to the=20
Factiva product set. We will tell you at least one year in advance of this,=
 =20
probably in mid-2002, anticipating a final shut down in mid-2003.=20

I encourage  you to visit our Web site and look at Factiva.com at=20
www.factiva.com/factiva  and find out why we're so excited about its impact=
=20
on improving your awareness  of the external global business environment an=
d=20
increasing the productivity of  your users. Please share your comments with=
=20
me directly at Clare.Hart@factiva.com.

Best  Regards,=20
