U.S. Orders Power Suppliers to Justify Prices in California

By JOSEPH KAHN

WASHINGTON, March 16 =02=05 Federal regulators told power suppliers in=20
California's volatile electricity market today to refund $55 million to sta=
te=20
utilities unless they could justify prices that regulators called excessive=
.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued the refund notice, which=20
affected six leading electricity generators, to cover the month of February=
.=20
Last Friday, it issued a similar order reviewing sales in January. In that=
=20
action, the agency asked generators either to justify or refund $69 million=
=20
in sales.

The refund mandates are part of a new push by the commission to intervene i=
n=20
California's troubled electricity market. State and national political=20
leaders have put pressure on the agency to use its authority =02=05 it has =
the=20
obligation to insure just and reasonable electricity rates nationwide =02=
=05 to=20
limit skyrocketing prices while the state tries to unravel its failed effor=
t=20
at deregulation.

The agency has indicated that it will also scrutinize electricity=20
transactions in March and April, possibly forcing refunds if it finds that=
=20
generators have charged rates above what the agency determines to be their=
=20
highest costs of production.

While the intervention has won support from some California officials and t=
he=20
Bush administration, the agency's orders have been criticized as too narrow=
=20
by some California market watchers and one of the federal agency's=20
commissioners.

The agency decided to apply a so- called rate screen, effectively a price=
=20
cap, to electricity transactions that occur during California's Stage 3=20
emergencies. Emergencies are declared when electricity supplies fall to=20
within 1.5 percent of demand. The agency has said that generators are most=
=20
likely to charge excessive prices when supplies are tightest.

But California has seen similarly high prices even when it is not forced to=
=20
declare a Stage 3 emergency, California officials say. They have criticized=
=20
the agency for effectively blessing the profits generators have made during=
=20
those nonemergency periods by excluding them from the universe of potential=
=20
refunds.

The agency has also imposed a relatively high rate screen =02=05 a proxy nu=
mber=20
intended to simulate the operating costs of the state's most inefficient=20
generating plants =02=05 on all sellers of electricity during crisis hours.=
=20
California officials had urged the agency to investigate the actual costs o=
f=20
individual generators and compare them to the prices they charged, tailorin=
g=20
penalties to the behavior of each generator.

In January, the commission set the rate screen at $273 per megawatt- hour. =
In=20
February, the screen rose to $430 per megawatt-hour. The commission said in=
 a=20
statement that higher natural gas prices accounted for some of the increase=
.

"This sounds like a step backward instead of the aggressive action we need=
=20
from FERC," said Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, referrin=
g=20
to the agency.

"Before the energy crisis started in California, electricity was selling at=
=20
an average wholesale cost of $30 a megawatt-hour," Senator Feinstein said.=
=20
"And now, FERC is saying a baseline of $430 a megawatt-hour is a reasonable=
=20
cost. Something is really wrong here."

Agency officials declined to comment on the rationale behind their order.

The refunds to date are a small fraction of total electricity sales in the=
=20
state. California officials, using a different methodology and a different=
=20
time frame to calculate price abuses, had asked the agency to force refunds=
=20
of $550 million for December and January.

California utility executives have estimated that unless prices are abated=
=20
much more aggressively in coming months, the state could end up paying a $7=
0=20
billion electricity bill in 2001, compared with $28 billion last year.

The latest refund notice named Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, Dynegy=20
Power Marketing, Portland General Electric Company, Reliant Energy Services=
,=20
the Mirant Corporation and Williams Energy Services, six of the country's=
=20
largest power marketers. Dynegy was asked to justify or refund $20.1 millio=
n=20
in sales, and Williams was asked to defend or rebate $21.5 million.

Spokesmen for the companies named have said that their companies operated=
=20
legally and ethically in California. Most of the companies said they planne=
d=20
to accept the agency's invitation to defend their prices.
