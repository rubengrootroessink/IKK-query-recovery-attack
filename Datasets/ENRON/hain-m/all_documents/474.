RE: EPSA Draft Comments on FERC Order Removing
      Obstacles
      ? Conference Call on Wed., March 28th at 2:00 p.m. (EST)
      ? Filing Due on Friday, March 30th

On March 14, 2001, FERC issued an "Order Removing Obstacles To Increased 
Electric Generation And Natural Gas Supply In the Western United States And 
Requesting Comments On Further Actions To Increase Energy Supply And Decrease 
Energy Consumption" (Order).  The Order announced certain actions the 
Commission is taking to promote electric generation supply and delivery in 
the United States' portion of the Western Interconnection, requesting 
comments on those and other, related proposals by March 30th.

Attached are EPSA's draft comments in response to the Commission's Order.  As 
discussed on the last conference call, we endorse many of the Commission's 
proposals, although stressing that infrastructure investment and seamless 
regional markets are the ultimate solutions to California's problems.  We 
also encourage the Commission to take additional steps to allow QF sales into 
the market.

Please review the attached draft and forward any comments or suggestions to 
Julie Simon at EPSA at 202-628-8200 or jsimon@epsa.org as soon as possible.  
We will discuss the draft comments on our conference call this Wednesday , 
March 28th, at 2:00 p.m. (EST). To access the call, dial 1-800-937-6563.  Ask 
for the Julie Simon/EPSA Call.
