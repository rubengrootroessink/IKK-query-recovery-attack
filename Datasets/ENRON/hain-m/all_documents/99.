Hello, Everyone -

This Notice confirms our next RTO West Regional Representatives Group (RRG)
meeting for Friday, June 1.  The meeting will be held at our usual place -
the Portland Sheraton Airport Hotel, Columbian Rooms, from 8:30 a.m. to
11:30 a.m.

The working agenda for the meeting is:

1.      Congestion Management

        The Congestion Management work groups have performed indefatigably in
developing a consensus model that we envision will be the basis for the very
substantial amount of congestion management work that lies immediately
ahead. The model will be presented by Kristi and Barney for full RRG
discussion as the first agenda item.

2.      Stage 2 Filing Plan and Schedule

        We're still putting the plan and schedule together for your review.  
We
appreciate the helpful comments on scheduling that many of you gave us at
our May 4 RRG meeting. We've tried to accommodate your views as much as we
could.  Here are the assumptions that are guiding the Stage 2 Filing Plan
and Schedule:

        a.      There will be an August 31 interim filing and a December 1 
completion
filing.

        b.      The August 31 filing will include information about key 
components of
RTO West, such as the congestion management model, an "illustrative" pricing
model, planning/expansion principles, and lists of facilities for inclusion.

        c.      Work will continue to be sequenced. For example, after 
essential
congestion management work is completed, work on losses, and ancillary
services will commence as soon as possible.  This sequencing will require a
major effort on congestion management with tight deadlines over the next
five weeks.  Work on all items needed for a completion filing in December
will commence as determined appropriate.

        d.      Work on underlying RTO liability issues will continue in 
parallel
throughout the near-term schedule.

We'll have a fuller plan and schedule for your review on June 1.

3.      Report on RTO West Technical Conference with FERC on Liability

        We will give you a report on the RTO West technical conference that is
being held today at FERC on liability.  As you know, in the April 26 RTO
West order, the Commission rejected the entire liability program.  An
objective of the technical conference is to explain the filing utilities'
concerns about risk allocation and liability and try to find an approach
that can resolve these concerns.

4.      Benefit Cost Analysis

        As we previewed at our May 4 RRG meeting, we have initiated 
discussions
with some potential contractors who could assist in developing a new RTO
West benefit-cost analysis.  We will report to you on the status of those
discussions and the next steps to move ahead on this important issue.

This Notice is being sent to you via our new "exploder" system, so I hope it
goes only to those who have told us they want to receive it. Please do not
reply to this e-mail as your reply will go to the entire RRG list of 400+
folks. We've already annoyed enough of you as it is.

Thanks very much, and we look forward to seeing you on June 1.

- Bud
