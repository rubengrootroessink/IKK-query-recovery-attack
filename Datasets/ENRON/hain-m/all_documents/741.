In addition to comments on FERC staff market mitigation plan, motions to 
intervene in  Strategic Energy, PSNM, and Universal Studios complaints are 
due this week.

It seems to me that all merit at least a plain vanilla intervenion, we may 
want to consider requesting that PSNM be consolidated with EPMI's (and 
other's) charge-back complaint.

PS For reference, here is Ron Carroll's list of open Calif. related FERC 
dockets.

Jim -- We need to have a follow-up to our conference call.  Several items 
need leads and we need to finalize who will be the lead of number 7, as we 
discussed.  Also need to include Ray Alvarez on the distribution list.  
Thanks Joe
