I am good all day tomorrow, and after 1:00 (PST) on Monday.  I even have some 
comments, since I spent my quality time on an airplane the last few days 
catching up on my reading.

At Mary Hain's request, the following are times Andrea Chambers and I would 
be available for the call:

- today 3/15: very problematic; possibly after 3:00 Denver time but will have 
to confirm;

- tomorrow 3/16: pretty open until 4:00 Denver time

- Monday 3/19:  OK except between 12 and 3 Denver time

Let me know what works for you; I apologize for being very tied up today.  JM
