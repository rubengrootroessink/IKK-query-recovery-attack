Joe Attached find the report you requested.  Alan - Governor Davis offered a 
highly discounted forward contract ($45-50/MWh) at the FERC settlement 
conference today.  As usual, California is trying to get its refund with or 
without FERC requiring it.  Alan - Tim and Joe will likely need your 
assistance with this settlement negotiation.
