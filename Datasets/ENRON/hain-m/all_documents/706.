Attached is a preliminary first draft of the WPTF comments to be filed on  
Thursday with regard to the FERC Staff's market monitoring proposal.? It is  
essentially based on Ben Zycher's draft paper concerning this issue.? Ben  
has made a number of astute economic arguments in response to their  
proposal.? In several areas, questions?are indicated, or a suggestion  that 
there is a need for additional material to support the statements  made.? 
?
It would be helpful to see the drafts in progress by other WPTF  members.? By 
reviewing them we can make sure that inconsistent observations  are not made 
and WPTF's own filing can be enriched by additional policy  arguments 
concerning the staff proposal.
