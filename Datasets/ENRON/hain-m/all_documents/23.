eSource presents Version 2.0 of eSearch, Enron's research website.   The 2.0 
release features new content, including World Energy Markets, Country 
Watch.com, and MindBranch.  The site has been designed with improved 
navigation and new core components developed by eSource researchers.

Reflecting our commitment to add value and provide you with a competitive 
advantage, we also have substantially increased the amount of information 
available on the site about eSource's services and the eSearch web site.  For 
example, we have added a Hot Topics page to introduce and explain new eSearch 
features and to showcase products, web sites, and publications.  When you 
visit our enhanced site you also will find much that is familiar, including 
the ability to submit your research request online to one of eSource's 
industry specialists.

In the upcoming months, we will continue to introduce many new enhancements, 
including new applications, services, and publications.

Please feel free to contact us on our eSource hotline at 713-853-7877 if you 
have any questions.
