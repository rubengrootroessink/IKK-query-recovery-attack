Hello --

As the Regional Representatives Group meeting tentatively scheduled for June
15th has been canceled, I am jumping into the void and scheduling a meeting to
discuss the development of RTO West planning principles for June 15th from 
9:00
to 3:00 at the RTO West Offices at Kingstad Center.

While this meeting will no doubt involve many of the Planning Content Group
representatives (who have received separate notification), we will discuss
planning principles from a policy perspective and it would be extremely
valuable to have policy representatives attend as well.

If you would like further information about the meeting, including the agenda
and meeting materials, please let me know.  My e-mail address is
kristiwallis@sprintmail.com, so if you would rather that your reply come
directly to me than to the entire RRG list, please e-mail me directly.

Thanks!  Kristi
