Rate hike in the offing

State regulators are weighing a 30 percent hike on electricity rates that=

by the Public Utilities Commission.=20
Still to be determined is the question of who will bear the brunt of the ra=

Loretta Lynch, president of the Public Utilities Commission, said the rate=

electricity from alternative energy companies.=20
The rate increase also satisfies conditions that are needed before the stat=

Lynch also said she will propose a tiered rate structure that would penaliz=

Seen as inevitable by many observers, the politically volatile issue of rat=

Consumer groups, calling the proposed rate hikes a $4.8 billion gift to=20
utilities, responded by saying they would hasten plans to take the state's=

Determine how much of that money will be used to reimburse the state=20

since mid-January. Lynch said Monday that although the state has not yet=20

Order the utilities to pay alternative energy companies, some of which have=

The electricity rate hike proposed Monday by the state's top utility=20

local business leaders.=20
"This is a regrettable necessity," said Justin Bradley, energy program=20

that the administration may be ready to retreat with a plan to hike the=20

increase over the current average rate in the PG&E service area of 6.4 cent=

That didn't faze Allan Zaremberg, president of the California Chamber of=20

rate hike. Higher natural gas costs, along with the dry winter that reduced=

the availability of hydroelectric power throughout the West, were bound to=

Bradley, speaking for tech manufacturers, said Lynch's plan promises to ste=

only one step toward a long-term solution. "We need an overall philosophy a=

Lynch, who described her offering as "merely a proposal to jumpstart the=20

gap between residential rates and those of industrial users, whose average=
=20
bill now logs in at about 3 cents a kilowatt hour less. Lynch suggested tha=
t=20
that differential be shaved by about a penny an hour.=20
That isn't the direction that Kern would like to see things move. "Our main=

concern would be that if there is a rate increase it be (done) equitably an=

But rate hikes promise to remove the cloud of debt -- billions of dollars=

Edison issued a late-day response to Lynch's move that seemed designed to=

Dan Walters: An absolutely incredible tale


(Published March 27, 2001)=20
From the onset of his governorship two-plus years ago, Gray Davis has=20
insisted, by both public words and private acts, that he and he alone would=
=20
make his administration's major policy decisions.=20
Legislators and lobbyists have complained that no one in Davis' office was=
=20
empowered to give an up or down signal on pending legislation, and=20
administration officials have recounted grimly - and very privately - tales=
=20
about Davis' insistence on deciding even minuscule policy matters. The=20
governor once castigated one of his Cabinet appointees before her colleague=
s=20
in the harshest possible language for making an environmental policy change=
=20
without his approval. The most routine action by a state agency is trumpete=
d=20
through the governor's media office. Davis has even joked about his=20
micromanagerial tendencies.=20
It is, therefore, utterly incredible - in the precise meaning of the word -=
=20
that Davis' handpicked president of the state Public Utilities Commission, =
a=20
former political adviser, would raise electric power rates by billions of=
=20
dollars without clearing it through Davis. Yet that's what the governor's=
=20
mouthpiece asserts.=20
On Monday, PUC President Loretta Lynch - acknowledging what anyone with hal=
f=20
a brain knew weeks ago - declared that power rates would have to jump=20
sharply. She is proposing an increase of three cents a kilowatt-hour, about=
=20
40 percent, in areas served by private utilities to cover the massive costs=
=20
associated with the current crisis, with a "tiered" structure to impose mos=
t=20
of the burden on high- volume power users.=20
Even Lynch was fudging, however, when she insisted that the boost - from=20
about seven cents a kilowatt-hour to 10 cents - would be "all that is neede=
d=20
going forward." In fact, as anyone who can do simple arithmetic can=20
calculate, it's only the beginning of a series of rate jumps that will be=
=20
needed to cover past debts and current wholesale costs. It's not improbable=
=20
that ultimately, rates will double (not counting another nickel a=20
kilowatt-hour that's imposed for delivery and other costs).=20
Lynch's public statement came just three days after Davis' aides briefed ke=
y=20
legislators on the likelihood of sharp rate boosts. Throughout, however,=20
Davis' spokesmen have insisted that the governor was not supporting such=20
increases and continues to believe that the supply and price crunches can b=
e=20
handled "within the existing rate structure," as one euphemistic version pu=
t=20
it.=20
The latest spin was issued by Davis' press secretary, Steve Maviglio, after=
=20
Lynch's statement. "The governor has not had conversations with any (utilit=
y)=20
commissioners about a potential rate hike," the Maviglio statement said. "I=
t=20
is still his hope and expectation that this matter can be resolved within t=
he=20
existing rate structure."=20
Clearly, the governor, who has been so insistent on doing things his way - =
a=20
tendency bordering on obsessive-compulsive behavior - has gone into the=20
bunker on this one, allowing Lynch to take the heat from consumer groups,=
=20
which immediately denounced the proposed rate increase as a giveaway to the=
=20
utilities.=20
It's cowardly, especially because the current crisis is largely a product o=
f=20
dithering by Davis and Lynch last summer when the first price-supply proble=
ms=20
appeared. Had they acted forthrightly then, with such steps as long-term=20
supply contracts, it would have been a relatively minor bump rather than a=
=20
full-blown disaster that threatens the state's business climate and its=20
solvency and will cause financial pain for Californians.=20
If California needs a utility rate increase, so be it. But we Californians=
=20
would appreciate not being treated like children who need sugarcoating for=
=20
the bad-tasting medicine. And we'd also appreciate not having our=20

Daniel Weintraub: No crisis is big enough to slow Davis' fund spree=20


(Published March 27, 2001)=20
If Gov. Gray Davis' potential opponents wanted to invent an anecdote to use=

against him when he runs for re-election next year, they couldn't do any=20
better than the one he handed them Friday.=20
While lawmakers desperately in need of leadership deadlocked on crucial=20

The governor's spokesman assures us that Davis did not actually play golf=

Right. Davis may have been in Palm Springs on state business, but it's=20
curious that, wherever he goes, this governor always seems to find a way to=

image of a governor so preoccupied with his own re-election that he can't=

fantasy. Rates will have to rise, perhaps double, to get us out of this,=20
according to the governor's staff. You cannot forever buy a dollar's worth =

This is incredible stuff, especially coming from the governor's own people.=

But what's even more astounding is that this news was delivered to the=20

Davis is not only out of town, it turns out. He's out of touch. Of course, =
we=20

Last week, to put it mildly, was a bad one for the governor, whom critics=

blackouts that would not have happened but for Davis' inattention to a=20

state's already short power supply. Alternative energy producers, including=

cogeneration plants that produce electricity as a byproduct of a=20
manufacturing operation, were going dark because they weren't getting paid=

for their electricity and could no longer afford to buy the fuel that fires=

their plants.=20
It has been widely known for months that the utilities weren't paying these=
=20
power producers. The Legislature has been working on a measure to get them=

paid and lower their rates by roughly half. It's a very important part of a=
ny=20
comprehensive solution to the crisis. But after the blackouts hit, Davis=20
acted as if he'd only just discovered the problem. He was outraged. He said=
=20
it was "immoral" for the utilities to collect money from ratepayers and not=

But that was only the beginning. The battle over getting the small energy=

power purchases Davis has been making since January on behalf of the=20

Energy woes give nuclear plants a life=20




Crisis offers second chance to all-but-discarded industry
By Bruce Lieberman=20
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER=20
March 26, 2001=20
A group of nuclear power advocates and energy experts gathered in an=20
auditorium in Irvine last month to discuss "Nuclear Power: The Option for t=
he=20
21st century?"=20
Their talk was upbeat.=20
Even asking that question would have been laughable five years ago.=20
In 1996, California was heading toward a deregulated electricity market. Th=
e=20
commercial nuclear power industry was heading toward extinction.=20
No way could it compete with coal and natural gas fired plants in a=20
deregulated market. Never would a utility invest billions of dollars to bui=
ld=20
a nuclear power plant when it had no guarantee of recovering that investmen=
t=20
through customer rates, which the architects of deregulation said would onl=
y=20
fall.=20
No one had ordered a nuclear power plant in this country since 1978, the ye=
ar=20
before a partial meltdown at the Three Mile Island plant and eight years=20
before a nuclear reactor blew up at Chernobyl.=20
Political support for nuclear power was all but dead, and electric utilitie=
s=20
in the United States knew it.=20
That was then.=20
Today, the country's nuclear power industry is looking at California's=20
troubled experiment with electricity deregulation, environmental concerns=
=20
over global warming and an unyielding demand for electricity -- and they se=
e=20
one thing:=20
Opportunity.=20
"I'm extremely optimistic about the future of nuclear power in the U.S.,"=
=20
Corbin A. McNeill, Jr., chairman and co-chief executive officer of utility=
=20
giant Exelon Corp., told the Irvine symposium.=20
Nuclear power advocates across the country say the industry is safer, more=
=20
efficient and more economically viable than ever before.=20
"I personally believe there will be a new generation of nuclear power plant=
s=20
in this country," said Ray Golden, a spokesman for Southern California=20
Edison's nuclear power plant at San Onofre. "It's a function of when."=20
Late last month, Senate Republicans introduced an energy bill that could le=
ad=20
to more nuclear power plants.=20
The National Energy Security Act, introduced by Sen. Frank Murkowski of=20
Alaska, would give a big boost to the industry. It would provide nearly $1=
=20
billion in research and development money, financial rewards for operators=
=20
who make nuclear power plants more efficient, and industrywide tax breaks.=
=20
Critics say the bill would just give taxpayer support to a dying industry.=
=20
"Clamoring for new subsidies doesn't help the industry make the case that i=
t=20
is now economically competitive and poised for a resurgence," said=20
Christopher Sherry, research director for the Safe Energy Communication=20
Council, a coalition of environmental groups founded after the 1979 acciden=
t=20
at Three Mile Island.
New lease on life
Two primary changes in the nuclear power industry have given advocates reas=
on=20
to be optimistic.=20
First, commercial power plants have become more efficient.=20
The Nuclear Energy Institute, the industry-backed trade association in=20
Washington, estimates that improvements in output at the nation's 103=20
commercial nuclear reactors have added the equivalent of about 25 1,000=20
megawatt-reactors.=20
The industry, matured by decades of experience, has improved safety and=20
shortened routine shutdowns for refueling and maintenance. Electricity=20
production costs are at an all-time low, at 1.83 cents per kilowatt-hour=20
(down from 3.12 cents in 1987), making nuclear energy competitive with coal=
=20
and natural gas, according to the institute.=20
Second, the federal government has begun extending operating licenses for=
=20
nuclear reactors.=20
Since last March, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has extended the 40-yea=
r=20
operating licenses for five reactors an additional 20 years. The operators =
of=20
five more reactors have applied for license extensions, and an additional 2=
8=20
are expected to seek extensions within the next five years, the institute=
=20
said.=20
Southern California Edison has not decided whether it will seek a license=
=20
extension for San Onofre's two remaining reactors, Units 2 and 3, Golden=20
said. Both are scheduled to be shut down in 2022.=20
In those reactors that obtain license extensions, utilities see new value,=
=20
and a profitable future.=20
Environmentalists see an avoidable danger.=20
Public Citizen, Ralph Nader's consumer advocate group, has called extending=
 a=20
nuclear power plant's license a "high-stakes gamble" that risks safety in=
=20
aging plants.=20
Critical components in a nuclear power plant, including the reactor pressur=
e=20
vessel that holds nuclear fuel and the thousands of steam generator tubes=
=20
that circulate heated and irradiated water, endure extreme stresses and=20
degrade over time.=20
"There was a reason (the nation's nuclear power plants) originally had=20
40-year licenses," said Scott Denman, executive director of the Safe Energy=
=20
Communication Council.=20
New sales, new worries
With license extensions, nuclear power plants are now seen by buyers as=20
profit centers. Six commercial nuclear reactors have been sold since=20
mid-1999, and the sale of eight reactors is pending, according to the Nucle=
ar=20
Energy Institute.=20
The merger of several big utilities has consolidated ownership of commercia=
l=20
nuclear reactors. The marriage of Commonwealth Edison-Unicom in Illinois an=
d=20
PECO Energy Co. in Pennsylvania in October created Exelon Corp. and placed =
17=20
reactors under one corporate roof.=20
McNeill, of Exelon, said the consolidation is creating tremendous economies=
=20
of scale that are bringing down operating costs.=20
Critics worry about a new rivalry between utilities that operate the plants=
.=20
"Electricity deregulation sets up a direct competition between power plants=
,=20
potentially compromising the safe operation of nuclear power plants as owne=
rs=20
attempt to minimize operation and maintenance costs while maximizing=20
electricity production and sales," Public Citizen has written.=20
The environmental group argues that a Feb. 3 electrical fire in the turbine=
=20
room of San Onofre's Unit 3 reactor, which occurred as workers were=20
re-starting the reactor after a routine refueling and maintenance outage,=
=20
shows that the industry is not as reliable as advocates would like the publ=
ic=20
to believe. Damage caused by the failed circuit breaker that caused the fir=
e=20
will keep the 1,100-megawatt reactor shut down through mid-May.=20
"The NRC and the nuclear industry have been skimping on maintenance during=
=20
refueling to improve the profitability of nuclear reactors," said Public=20
Citizen's Jim Riccio, senior policy analyst for the group's Critical Mass=
=20
Energy and Environment Program.=20
Yet, according to reports the company filed Feb. 16 with the Securities and=
=20
Exchange Commission, Southern California Edison, the majority owner of the=
=20
San Onofre plant, will lose between $80 million and $100 million because of=
=20
the Feb. 3 fire.=20
That comes at a rough time for the cash-strapped utility.=20
The San Onofre nuclear power plant is the company's most important asset at=
 a=20
time when it is near bankruptcy because of skyrocketing electricity costs=
=20
from out-of-state power generators.=20
"San Onofre is the only thing that makes the company money," Golden said.
State's nuclear future
California, the most populous state in the country and the world's sixth=20
largest economy, has four nuclear reactors -- two at San Onofre and two at=
=20
the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant near San Luis Obispo. Yet, those four=
=20
nuclear reactors generate more than 4,000 megawatts of electricity, nearly =
18=20
percent of the electricity generated in California.=20
A third plant, Rancho Seco, near Sacramento, was shut down in 1989 when=20
voters demanded its closure. Opponents said it was badly run.=20
Yet, so desperate are state legislators to find sources of power that at=20
least one has discussed turning Rancho Seco back on. On Feb. 22, state Sen.=
=20
Tom McClintock, R-Thousand Oaks, introduced a bill to study whether the sta=
te=20
should buy Rancho Seco.=20
McClintock said the plant could be put back into service in nine months for=
=20
$500 million. And, with new turbines, the plant could increase its producti=
on=20
of electricity from 800 megawatts to 1,100 megawatts -- enough power for mo=
re=20
than a million people.=20
McClintock acknowledges there is little enthusiasm in the state Legislature=
=20
for embracing nuclear energy as one answer to California's energy crisis.=
=20
"Politically, they're scared to death of it," he said.=20
John. P. Holdren, a professor of environmental policy at Harvard's John F.=
=20
Kennedy School of Government, said the high cost of building nuclear power=
=20
plants likely will keep the industry from expanding in the short term.=20
In the longer term, though, Holdren said nuclear energy could offer a real=
=20
alternative to fossil fuels and thereby help combat global warming.=20
In testimony to Congress last June, he outlined several conditions that mus=
t=20
be met before the nuclear energy production can expand. Among them were som=
e=20
high hurdles:=20
?The industry must become competitive with other alternative energy sources=
=20
that do not emit carbon into the atmosphere, such as hydro-electric power.=
=20
?Nuclear power plants around the world must prove they are safe.=20
?The nation must find a permanent repository for nuclear waste and build=20
temporary storage facilities until one opens.=20
?Research into reprocessing used nuclear fuel, which produces a form of=20
plutonium that could be used in nuclear weapons, should be suspended.=20
?Nuclear energy must gain widespread public acceptance.=20
New breed=20
If any power company debuts the next generation of nuclear power plants in=
=20
the United States, it may very well be Exelon Corp.=20
The company is helping to finance research in South Africa into a new type =
of=20
nuclear reactor, called the "pebble bed modular reactor." The 110-megawatt=
=20
reactor, about a tenth the size of conventional nuclear reactors in the=20
United States, would be designed to eliminate the risk of a meltdown, backe=
rs=20
say.=20
Passive safety features would eliminate the need for redundant back-up=20
systems, containment structures and off-site emergency plants, drastically=
=20
cutting costs. Because of their modular design, additional reactors could b=
e=20
added at a single site. McNeill said the new technology could be imported t=
o=20
the United States and Europe within the next few years.=20
"A typical plant should be able to generate a kilowatt of electricity for=
=20
less than a penny," he said.=20
Environmental groups have been extremely critical of the design, saying tha=
t=20
it needs some type of containment structure, such as the concrete domes at=
=20
San Onofre, to keep radiation from escaping into the atmosphere should=20
disaster strike.=20
Meanwhile, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has approved three designs for=
=20
other, more conventional reactors.=20
McClintock said it's only a matter of time before politicians and the publi=
c=20
re-think their positions on nuclear energy.=20
The legislator predicts that a shift in opinions will come this summer, whe=
n=20
projections by the California Independent System Operator show that=20
electricity supply shortages will force blackouts on 6 million people.=20
"By the time the state has survived the summer of 2001," McClintock said, "=
as=20
a practical matter, we'll be forced to take a new look at nuclear energy.=

Top state power regulator proposes 40 percent rate increase=20




By Karen Gaudette
ASSOCIATED PRESS=20
March 26, 2001=20
SAN FRANCISCO =01) California's top power regulator proposed a 40 percent h=
ike=20
in electricity rates Monday, saying such an increase should encourage=20
customers to cut back on usage and conserve enough power to get through the=
=20
hot summer months.=20
Loretta Lynch, president of the Public Utilities Commission, said rates=20
should increase by an average of 3 cents per kilowatt hour. The current rat=
e=20
averages 7.5 cents per kilowatt hour.=20
The higher rates could go into effect as early as Tuesday, when the PUC=20
meets. Lynch and two other members of the five-member PUC were appointed by=
=20
Gov. Gray Davis, and Lynch's proposal is expected to be approved by the=20
commission.=20
Lynch, who repeatedly refused to characterize the hike as a 40 percent=20
increase, said the increase was needed to avoid significant power problems=
=20
this summer.=20
"That number should be all that is needed going forward," she said at a new=
s=20
conference, "to keep utilities solvent and ensure that the treasurer of the=
=20
state can issue bonds."=20
Lynch's proposal is at odds with that of administrative law judge Christine=
=20

.=20
Any increase would be on top of the 9 percent to 15 percent rate increase t=
he=20
PUC approved in January, and an additional 10 percent increase already=20
scheduled for next year.=20
Lynch also supports a "tiered" rate system that would charge residential an=
d=20
businesses customers more if they're large users and fail to cut back, a mo=
ve=20
aimed at encouraging conservation.=20
The governor repeatedly has said he is confident the state's power crisis c=

be resolved without further rate hikes. But Davis aides have concluded that=
=20
rates must rise, given that wholesale power costs remain high. Several=20
lawmakers, including Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg, have said a rate=20
increase is inevitable.=20
"It's obvious to me that unless you rob a bank or win a lottery you are not=
=20
going to be able to do this without raising rates," Senate President Pro Te=
m=20
John Burton, D-San Francisco, said Monday.=20
Southern California Edison Co. and Pacific Gas & Electric Co. both have=20

PUC to Vote on Big Rate Hike; OK Is Likely=20

Electricity: Agency chief urges a boost of about 40% for many, and calls it=
=20
necessary to raise cash and encourage conservation. Higher cost could show =
up=20
in May bills.=20

By TIM REITERMAN and NANCY VOGEL, Times Staff Writers=20

?????SAN FRANCISCO--Millions of Californians would see electricity rates ri=
se=20
by about 40% under a plan presented Monday by the state's top power regulat=
or.
?????Loretta Lynch, president of California's Public Utilities Commission,=
=20
called rate hikes necessary both to raise cash and to encourage conservatio=
n.
?????Her plan would charge some customers of the state's two biggest privat=
e=20
utilities 3 cents more per kilowatt-hour, depending on how much electricity=
=20
they consume. The higher cost would show up in May power bills.
?????Lynch promised to target the increases on heavy users of electricity a=
nd=20
spare nearly half of residential customers from paying more. The commission=
=20
is scheduled to vote on her proposal today, and it is almost certain to win=
=20
approval, according to commissioners.=20
?????It would cost customers of Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas =
&=20
Electric a total of $4.8 billion a year.=20
?????San Diego Gas & Electric is not covered by the proposed rate hikes,=20
though officials there said their utility should be.
?????Nor would the increases affect the customers of municipally owned=20
utilities in Los Angeles, Riverside, Pasadena, Anaheim and elsewhere.
?????Lynch's proposal drew fire from consumer advocates, sighs of resignati=
on=20
from lawmakers and enthusiasm from Wall Street. Stock prices for both=20
companies jumped by nearly one-third.
?????For renters and homeowners, the proposal could cost nothing or as much=
=20
as 40% more per month. Business customers--who now pay lower rates--could s=
ee=20
even higher increases.
?????The latest proposed increase would come on top of an average 10% rate=
=20
hike for all users imposed in January, which would become permanent under=
=20
Lynch's plan. An additional 10% increase for residential and small business=
=20
users is already scheduled for this time next year.
?????"We recognize the utilities are in severe financial distress," Lynch=
=20
said. "For utilities to keep the lights on, we unfortunately came to the=20
conclusion a rate increase was needed."
?????Commissioner Geoffrey Brown, recently appointed by Davis, predicted th=
at=20
the plan will pass. Commissioner Richard Bilas, a Republican appointed by=
=20
former Gov. Pete Wilson, would not say whether he would vote for Lynch's=20
proposal but said "rates need to go up."
?????Davis, who named three of the five commissioners, distanced himself=20
Monday from the PUC action, saying that it's an independent body. He repeat=
ed=20
that it is his expectation that rate increases can be avoided.
?????"I've not seen enough information to persuade me we need a rate hike,"=
=20
the governor said at a news conference after speaking to students at Walt=
=20
Disney Elementary School in Burbank.
?????If the increase is approved today, Lynch said, it will be refined in t=
he=20
30 days it takes the utilities to change their billing processes. The rate=
=20
increase would be subject to refund if it is more than enough to cover cost=
s=20
of energy purchases.
?????Lynch said she cannot finalize the proposal until she gets more=20
information about power supply and cost projections from the California=20
Department of Water Resources, which began buying electricity on behalf of=
=20
the nearly bankrupt utilities in mid-January. That's when some generators=
=20
refused to sell to the utilities for fear of not getting paid.

?????Utilities Earned Substantial Profits
?????The utilities have been burdened by wholesale electricity prices that=
=20
have topped 10 times the levels of those a year ago.
?????Rising demand for electricity across the West, plus fundamental flaws =
in=20
the design of the deregulated market that California opened in 1998, have=
=20
allowed sellers of electricity to earn substantial profits. Since the state=
=20
stepped in to buy electricity for the utilities, it has spent about $3=20
billion covering roughly 34% of the state's power needs.
?????While Davis has adamantly resisted rate hikes, other politicians have=
=20
come to call increases inevitable. The state and utilities need a better ca=
sh=20
flow to cover wholesale power costs expected to soar again this summer, the=
y=20
say.
?????And rate boosts will serve another critical purpose, they say, by=20
prompting Californians to switch off lights, buy efficient refrigerators an=
d=20
shut down hot tubs. Such conservation will be crucial in whether the state=
=20
avoids blackouts, grid operators say.
?????"If it is tiered right, it wouldn't break my heart," Senate President=
=20
Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco) said, adding that he expects that any=
=20
increase will exempt low-income people.
?????Lynch said repeatedly that the 3-cent-per-kilowatt-hour hike she=20
proposed should be all that is necessary to allow the state and utilities t=
o=20
keep buying electricity. The more than $13 billion the utilities claim they=
=20
are owed for power purchases since May must be resolved through negotiation=
s=20
between the governor's office and the utilities, she said.
?????The Legislature already has approved a bill guaranteeing that those wh=
o=20
use 30% more than their minimal allocation, known as the baseline, won't fe=
el=20
the hikes.
?????The baseline is a certain amount of electricity--50% to 60% of the=20
average residential use per month--that varies regionally, so that a=20
homeowner in the desert has a higher baseline amount than one living on the=
=20
temperate coast. Electricity consumed up to the baseline amount costs less.
?????Last year, Edison customers paid 6.2 cents per kilowatt-hour for=20
electricity. (The average home uses about 700 to 1,000 kilowatt-hours per=
=20
month.) The PUC raised that rate to 7.2 cents in January, and Lynch's=20
proposal would boost it to 10.2 cents.
?????Edison customers also pay an additional 5.25 cents for distribution,=
=20
billing and other costs on top of the electricity charge.
?????Lynch projects that under her plan about half of Edison's households=
=20
would have no monthly bill increases, one-fifth would have an 8% increase,=
=20
and fewer than about one-third of the households would have a 27% increase.
?????Rather than welcome the potential rate hikes, Edison officials said th=
ey=20
were frustrated that the PUC proposal does not guarantee that the higher=20
rates will cover all of the utility's and the state's costs.
?????"It helps, but it doesn't solve the problem," said John R. Fielder, a=
=20
senior vice president at Edison. "And it's really vulnerable because if it'=
s=20
not enough, then what do you do?"
?????Fielder pointed out that when Edison argued for higher rates in=20
December, it was turned down, causing the utility to accumulate additional=
=20
billions in debt. Monday's PUC proposal treats that debt as a "stranded=20
cost," which the utility could eventually be expected to absorb, he said.
?????In a two-hour hearing on Lynch's proposal, PG&E lawyer Chris Warner=20
called it a "a step in the right direction."
?????"We agree with President Lynch that it's time to pay the power bills,"=
=20
he said. Warner declined to elaborate until the utility could study the=20
proposal further.
?????Consumer groups immediately attacked the rate hike proposal.
?????Jason Zeller, an attorney with the PUC's independent Office of Ratepay=
er=20
Advocates, complained that "customers had no notice that they would be sock=
ed=20
with the largest rate increase in California history."
?????"My big concern . . . is it imposes massive increases, damages the=20
economy, and there is no guarantee it would do any good," Zeller said.
?????Bob Finkelstein of the Utility Reform Network said: "The focus [of the=
=20
PUC] should be to bring prices down, not rates up."
?????Power sellers in California's market have "an uncanny ability to sniff=
=20
out money," Finkelstein said, and the Lynch proposal "only puts more on the=
=20
table."
?????Lynch blamed the need for rate hikes on exorbitant prices for wholesal=
e=20
electricity, noting that California paid $7.4 billion for electricity in al=
l=20
of 1999, and $5.2 billion last January. She also blamed the Federal Energy=
=20
Regulatory Commission for failing to impose a cap on wholesale electricity=
=20
prices in California, despite its mandate under federal law to assure=20
citizens of "just and reasonable" prices.
?????To plug the $3-billion hole in the state budget and pay for power in=
=20
coming months, lawmakers in February passed a law to sell roughly $10 billi=
on=20
in revenue bonds. The bonds would be paid back with money collected by the=
=20
utilities from their customers.
?????In recent weeks the utilities have argued that little or nothing is le=
ft=20
over after they subtract their own costs of producing and distributing powe=
r=20
from what they collect from monthly bills.
?????But on Monday, Lynch issued a draft decision that would force the=20
utilities to send ratepayer revenue to the state based on a formula set by=
=20
the PUC.
?????Representatives of both PG&E and Edison criticized that proposal at=20
Monday's hearing, saying it gave priority to the state Department of Water=
=20
Resources.
?????Lynch also proposed forcing the utilities to begin paying hundreds of=
=20
small energy producers. Some of those renewable and alternative power=20
generators have not been paid since November. Many have shut down, and thei=
r=20
lost output contributed to rotating blackouts last week.
?????The potential rate hikes were seen as lessening the possibility of=20
utility bankruptcy. That sent investors diving into the stocks of Edison=20
International, parent of Southern California Edison, and PG&E Corp, parent =
of=20
Pacific Gas & Electric Co.
?????Edison rocketed $3.35, or 30%, to $14.55 while PG&E shares leaped $3.1=
0,=20
or 29%, to $13.75. Both stocks have lost considerable value in recent weeks=
=20
as the electricity crisis dragged on with no solution.
?????Investors were not discouraged by PG&E's warning that it might take a=
=20
$4.1-billion after-tax charge against 2000 earnings if it concludes that it=
=20
will not be able to collect its electricity debts through rates. Edison las=

Undermining Gov. Gray Davis' pledge that electricity bills will not go up,=
=20
state regulators yesterday proposed an across-the-board 40 percent rate=20
increase as part of a series of measures to remedy California's energy=20
crisis.=20
The immediate rate increase, to be voted on today by the Public Utilities=
=20
Commission, includes a new 30 percent increase and makes permanent a=20
"temporary" 10 percent average increase approved in January.=20
However, heavier electricity users would end up paying more than lighter=20
users under a so-called tiered system that could be enacted by May, PUC=20
President Loretta Lynch said.=20
"It's time to pay the power bills for California," she said. "We have=20
unfortunately come to the conclusion that a rate increase is needed."=20
Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the governor, insisted that Davis played no=
=20
role in the decision to raise consumers' rates.=20
"He has not signed off on this," Maviglio said. "The PUC is an independent=
=20
body. It does what it wants."=20
However, Maviglio acknowledged that the PUC is controlled by Davis'=20
appointees and that the governor's staff was briefed in advance of=20
yesterday's announcement.=20
Lynch said she does not expect further rate increases this year. But she al=
so=20
said the situation could change depending on current bailout negotiations=
=20
between the governor and near-bankrupt utilities as well as the state's=20
ability to recoup costs from its multibillion-dollar power purchases.=20
Harry Snyder, senior advocate for Consumers Union in San Francisco, said=20
there is no way state officials can avoid additional rate increases after=
=20
confronting sky-high electricity prices this summer.=20
"It's a disaster," he said. "By the end of summer, rates will go up by 100=
=20
percent. They have to because these new increases will barely pay back the=
=20
state for its power purchases."=20
Snyder also criticized the governor for having insisted that consumers woul=
d=20
not be saddled with paying the tab for the bungled deregulation of=20
California's power market.=20
Davis has said repeatedly in recent weeks that rates would not need to rise=
=20
beyond "the existing rate structure," which many observers took to mean=20
January's 10 percent increase plus an additional 10 percent increase next=
=20
year.=20
"It's the Nixon, trust-me school of government," Snyder said. "How can we=
=20
take the governor at his word?"=20
Because Lynch and other Democratic appointees hold a majority on the five-=
=20
member PUC, passage of the rate increase today is all but assured.=20
However, Lynch said consumers probably would not see the change reflected i=
n=20
their bills until a tiered rate system can be introduced within 45 days.=20
Under that system, according to PUC figures, Pacific Gas and Electric Co.=
=20
customers who are light power users would see no change from current averag=
e=20
electricity bills of $60.=20
Medium users -- those who stay within 200 percent of pre-established limits=
=20
-- would see average bills rise by 9 percent to about $65. Heavy users woul=
d=20
see average bills jump by 36 percent to around $132.=20
Rate increases for customers of Southern California Edison would range from=
 8=20
percent for medium users to 27 percent for heavy users.=20
These increases would be on top of January's rate increases, which ranged=
=20
from 9 percent for residential customers to 15 percent for large industrial=
=20
users.=20
Investors saw this as manna from heaven for California's cash-strapped=20
utilities. PG&E's stock soared 29 percent yesterday to $13.75, while Edison=
's=20
shares climbed 30 percent $14.55.=20
The increase would generate about $2.5 billion a year for PG&E and $2.3=20
billion for Edison.=20
Yet many uncertainties remain. For example, the rate increase would not=20
affect about $13 billion in debt racked up by the utilities as a result of=
=20
runaway wholesale power prices.=20
That issue will be left for the governor to tackle in his bailout talks.=20
Maviglio, Davis' spokesman, said yesterday that the negotiations are making=
=20
progress, but he could not say whether a deal at last is taking shape.=20
ALTERNATIVE ENERGY PLANTS
Another wild card is the matter of alternative-energy providers, which have=
=20
cut back production in recent days because they no longer can pay their=20
natural gas bills.=20
The companies -- known as "qualifying facilities" or "QFs" in industry=20
parlance -- say they are owed millions of dollars by PG&E and Edison.=20
The PUC will vote today on forcing the utilities to pay the alternative=20
energy providers for all power received, but only on a forward-looking basi=
s.=20
Past debt would not have to be paid right away.=20
It remains to be seen whether the qualifying facilities, half of which were=
=20
shut down during last week's blackouts, will be able to resume operations.=
=20
"We cannot direct the gas suppliers to sell to them," admitted PUC member=
=20
Carl Wood.=20
The commission also is expected to vote today on requiring PG&E and Edison =
to=20
repay about $4 billion paid by the state Department of Water Resources to=
=20
purchase electricity for the utilities' customers.=20
However, it is not yet clear how revenue from ratepayers will be divvied up=
=20
in the future. The utilities and the Department of Water Resources are at=
=20
odds over which would get first crack at the funds to cover expenses.=20
BLAME GOES TO PROFITEERS
Lynch, the PUC president, laid blame for California's troubles on profit-=
=20
hungry power companies that she said have gouged the state's consumers, as=
=20
well as on a reluctance among federal regulators to limit how much generato=
rs=20
can charge for electricity.=20
"The federal market cops need to get back on the beat because they're nowhe=
re=20
to be found," she said.=20
A spokeswoman for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in Washington, D=
.=20
C., declined to comment.=20
Nettie Hoge, executive director of The Utility Reform Network in San=20
Francisco, questioned the wisdom of raising consumers' rates as long as=20
wholesale prices remain unchecked, especially going into a summer of expect=
ed=20
shortages.=20
"Neither the commission nor the governor are willing to say no to the carte=
l=20
that is gouging us and extracting obscene profits," she said. "Every time w=
e=20
put a burden on ratepayers and ask them to dig deeper in their pockets,=20
the cartel smells money and moves in for the kill."=20
Lynch stressed that the burden on ratepayers would be eased under a tiered=
=20
system that she said would promote conservation.=20
'HOGS' WILL BE SLAUGHTERED=20
"Electricity hogs will need to pay more," she said. "If you want to run you=
r=20
pool pump during peak hours this summer, you will pay for that."=20
Tiered rates have found support virtually across the spectrum, from the=20
governor's office to consumer watchdogs. The PUC is expected to have no=20
difficulty adopting such a system.=20
But Snyder at Consumers Union took issue with Lynch's characterization of=
=20
higher rates as a conservation tool.=20
"That's total bull," he said. "She's just trying to rationalize the increas=
e=20
by saying it's all the consumer's fault.=20
"The governor said there would be a sharing of pain," Snyder added. "This=
=20
isn't sharing. This is nothing but pain for consumers."=20
The Agenda=20
Regulators will vote today on:=20
-- Immediately raising electricity rates 30 percent and making permanent a=
=20
"temporary" 10 percent rate increase adopted in January.=20
-- Forcing utilities to pay smaller power companies for their output. Half =

such generators were shut down during last week's blackouts because they=20
could not afford fuel.=20
-- Requiring utilities to reimburse the state Department of Water Resources=

Sacramento -- Gov. Gray Davis clung yesterday to his expectation that energ=
y=20
rates won't have to go up and insisted that he didn't know one of his top=
=20
political appointees would propose a 40 percent increase.=20
Those comments drew shaking heads from many lawmakers, both Republicans and=
=20
Democrats, who believe that the governor was an active participant in the=
=20
plan announced by the head of the Public Utilities Commission.=20
"I don't believe it," said Sen. Jackie Speier, D-Hillsborough. "I think the=
=20
governor has been real clear from day one how he views everyone else in sta=
te=20
government. He certainly believes his appointees should reflect his vision.=
=20
I'd be very surprised if he isn't communicating. And if he isn't, he should=
=20
be. "=20
Political observers say Davis may have thought he had found a political out=
=20
by having the commission -- which is accustomed to making unpopular decisio=
ns=20
- - take the lead on raising rates.=20
But the strategy could backfire as lawmakers from both parties say the=20
governor's refusal to acknowledge the necessity of rate increases -- a=20
position held by even his top advisers -- is making the energy crisis worse=
.=20
Pollster Mark DiCamillo of the Field Institute said Davis is making a=20
political calculation by keeping to his word on not needing rate increases.=
=20
"I think it may be a public posture he wants to consistently maintain -- he=
=20
may not prevail -- but they may have to drag him kicking and screaming to=
=20
raise rates," DiCamillo said. "But if his will is not carrying the day, he=
=20
may be seen as powerless and that could drag him down."=20
While PUC chairwoman Loretta Lynch announced that that rates will probably =
go=20
up 40 percent, Davis stayed far away from the firestorm enveloping the=20
Capitol, instead handing out academic performance bonuses at a school in=20
Southern California.=20
The governor has often tried to have it both ways with the PUC. Last week h=
e=20
held a press conference to say he was going to direct the commission to act=
=20
on a plan to bail out alternative power generators. Yet yesterday a spokesm=
an=20
insisted Davis knew nothing of Lynch's plans to propose a tiered rate=20
increase.=20
Davis has appointed three members of the PUC, giving his members a majority=
=20
on the five-member board.=20
But this isn't the first time Davis has tried to shy away from PUC decision=
s.=20
In December, when he had appointed just two members, he said, "It doesn't=
=20
matter what I think. The PUC is the legal body that will make a determinati=
on=20
as to what, if any, rate increase is appropriate."=20
Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks, elected to his new=20
leadership role just yesterday, said Davis cannot run away from this rate=
=20
increase.=20
"My guess is he has everything to do with it," Cox said. "My guess is Ms.=
=20
Lynch at the PUC doesn't work independently of the governor."=20
But sources in the governor's office insisted that the governor had no=20
knowledge of Lynch's press conference. In fact, they said the governor was=
=20
frustrated by not knowing the announcement was coming.=20
Lawmakers could only shrug yesterday when told that the governor yesterday=
=20
said in written comments that it is his "hope and expectation that this=20
matter can be resolved within the existing rate structure."=20
Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, the lower house's point man on th=
e=20
energy crisis, called Davis' attempts to keep rates stable "noble."=20
"We are now past the time of pursuing noble goals -- we're at a time when i=
t=20
is important to problem solve," he said. "One of the tools absolutely=20
necessary to solve this problem is to raise rates. I don't like it, I don't=
=20
think there is anybody who does. But to continue now to maintain the fictio=
n=20
that rates don't have to go up, will cause rates to go up more when they do=
=20
go up and will make it take longer to solve the problem."=20
Speier said she believes the problem is "spiraling out of control."=20
"It is a time to take bold steps, such as seizing assets," she said. "This =
is=20
how leadership is tested."=20
Davis has taken pride in being cautious, but in an emergency that lack of=
=20
decisiveness could be his downfall.=20
"As this goes on and the treasury is barren, he is going to be attacked for=
=20
other reasons," DiCamillo said. "As other things get cut from the budget,=
=20
this will loom in the backdrop."=20
One advantage for Davis is that the PUC has often been a scapegoat for=20
unpopular regulatory decisions, DiCamillo said.=20
But on a day when Secretary of State Bill Jones became the first Republican=
=20
to announce that he will oppose Davis in 2002, GOP lawmakers grew bolder in=
=20
their criticism.=20
"Regretably, I don't think the governor even today understands the magnitud=
e=20
of the problem," Cox said. "The governor has to be engaged."=20
Assemblyman Bill Leonard, R-San Bernardino, said ratepayers will be faced=
=20
with a "Davis price surcharge."=20
"The indecision, the lack of a plan for the last four months has resulted i=
n=20
increased costs that have to be laid at the governor's door," he said.=20
Energy Crisis Jolting Sacramento What Gov. Gray Davis has said this year=20
about the possibility of rate increases: . After a plan for the state to=20

Pleas for Warning Of Next Blackout=20
ISO to address customers' biggest gripe about outages=20

Under intense public pressure, state power regulators will try to solve a=
=20
widespread complaint about the rolling blackouts plaguing California: how t=
o=20
warn people that the lights are about to go out.=20
One of the biggest gripes people have about the outages is getting no advan=
ce=20
warning of outages that render everything plugged into a wall socket utterl=
y=20
useless.=20
While many people say they understand blackouts are, for now, a fact of lif=
e,=20
they also want to know when the next one will roll through their=20
neighborhood.=20
Jillian Hom, an employee at a San Francisco branch of Baskin Robbins, said =
it=20
would sure come in handy to get advance notice of a power outage --=20
especially in the ice cream business.=20
"It would give us time to cover up all the flavors of ice cream so they wou=
ld=20
stay colder longer" she said. "It would also give us time to prepare becaus=
e=20
we're not supposed to stay open during a blackout."=20
Although the utilities pull the plug, the decision to start a rolling=20
blackout is made in Folsom by the Independent System Operator, which manage=
s=20
the state's massive power grid. The outages begin whenever California's=20
electricity reserves dip below 1.5 percent, threatening to bring the grid=
=20
crashing down.=20
ISO board member Carl Guardino thinks it might be time for the agency and t=
he=20
utilities to begin warning people before cutting the juice. He plans to rai=
se=20
the issue during Friday's board meeting.=20
Guardino could not be reached for comment but purportedly wants to balance=
=20
protecting the grid with allowing people to prepare for a blackout.=20
"He understands the situation the ISO is in, and he understands that PG&E i=
s=20
doing the best that it can," said Michelle Montague-Bruno, spokeswoman for=
=20
the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group -- which Guardino leads. "He's=20
completely sympathetic to everything everyone is dealing with. But he also=
=20
thinks we have to do something to improve the system."=20
The inconvenience of a sudden outage goes far beyond missing your favorite=
=20
soap opera or even having the ice cream melt. Businesses lose money.=20
Researchers working with radioactive, infectious or corrosive materials fac=
e=20
grave risks. High-tech firms spend hours or even days recalibrating=20
equipment. The list goes on.=20
These hassles could be minimized, if not avoided, if PG&E would tell people=
=20
when and where the outages will strike, Montague-Bruno said.=20
"The more warning they can give, the more we can prepare," she said.=20
Although the outages often come out of the blue, PG&E's 4.8 million custome=
rs=20
have a vague idea of when it's their turn in the rotation.=20
Customers are assigned to one of 14 blocks, and power is cut to each block=
=20
sequentially. Customers can determine which block they're in by looking at=
=20
the lower left corner of their bill.=20
"If you're in block 14 and we're (cutting power) in block 4, you know you c=
an=20
breathe fairly easily," said utility spokesman Scott Blakey. "But if you're=
=20
in block 5, you know you can expect an outage."=20
But the blocks cover vast swatches of the state, and power can be cut to a=
=20
portion of each block. That leaves critics complaining that block numbers a=
re=20
all but meaningless.=20
Brandie Spencer, a shift manager at the Pasta Pomodoro chain in Berkeley,=
=20
said the restaurant's accounting department deals with the power bills so s=
he=20
has no clue what her block number is.=20
"I have no idea when they plan to pull the plug on us," she said. "But I do=
=20
know that it will be bad if it comes as a surprise in the middle of a busy=
=20
day.=20
We don't have back-up generators, so food orders won't be able to be filled=
,=20
cash registers won't work and I can't very well send customers home."=20
PG&E argues providing more specific information could jeopardize public=20
safety. It claims criminals would know which neighborhoods and businesses=
=20
aren't protected by burglar alarms, security cameras and the like.=20
But authorities in Palo Alto and Alameda -- two cities with municipal=20
utilities that actively tell customers where the next outage will strike an=
d=20
roughly when it's coming -- haven't found any evidence supporting that view=
.=20
"I can't think of a major increase in crime during the blackouts," said Age=
nt=20
Jim Coffman, spokesman for the Palo Alto Police Department.=20
Others note that outages typically come during daylight hours, when crimina=
ls=20
are less likely to strike, or early in the evening, when most folks are hom=
e.=20
PG&E also argues there isn't time to alert millions of people to rolling=20
blackouts, which often start with just a few minutes notice from the ISO.=
=20
"We often do not have any lead time," Blakey said. "The last time we had=20
outages, (the ISO) lost two power plants just like that. Bing, bang, boom a=
nd=20
we were in the middle of a Stage 3 alert."=20
Municipal utilities also have a fraction of the customers that PG&E does,=
=20
which makes it far easier for them to notify people, Blakey said.=20
"We have an average of 225,000 people in each block," he said.=20
That's about 10 times as many people as the Palo Alto Utility Department=20
serves. But municipal utilities said notifying customers isn't particularly=
=20
difficult -- or costly -- thanks to the Internet.=20
Alameda Power and Telecom spent about $20,000 creating a system using a=20
telephone hot line, e-mails and faxes to provide information to its 32,000=
=20
customers, said utility spokesman Matt McCabe. The information is available=
=20
within minutes of an ISO call for outages, he said.=20
"It wasn't a tremendous expenditure of money, but it has been a lot of time=
,=20
" McCabe said. "But Alamedans have a very high expectation, and rightfully=
=20
so, that we should keep them apprised of the power situation. That's an=20
obligation that we have."=20

PUC set to give up on rate freeze; increases up to 36% likely=20

BY VBY JOHN WOOLFOLK=20

vMercury News=20


State regulators today are poised to deliver consumers a jolt by boosting=
=20
residential electric bills as much as 36 percent or $47 a month.=20
The California Public Utilities Commission's proposed rate increase comes o=
n=20
top of a 9 percent ``temporary'' increase approved in January and despite=
=20
Gov. Gray Davis' promises to solve the state's crisis without higher rates.=
=20
Regulators plan to make that 9 percent increase permanent as well. The high=
er=20
rates would take effect immediately upon expected approval at today's meeti=
ng=20
and would appear on bills beginning in May.=20
``We have unfortunately come to the conclusion that a rate increase is=20
needed,'' said Loretta Lynch, the commission's president. ``It's time to pa=
y=20
the power bills for California.''=20
Under the tiered-rate proposal, more than half of residential customers wou=
ld=20
see their bills jump by $6 to $47 a month. But energy misers and the poor=
=20
won't see any increase.=20
Industrial customers, who historically enjoyed lower rates than homeowners,=
=20
would see their bills soar more than 40 percent. Commercial customers would=
=20
pay 22 percent more than they do now.=20
Lynch described the plan as a way to encourage conservation and help avoid=
=20
blackouts this summer.=20
``Electricity hogs will need to pay more for the energy they use this=20
summer,'' she said.=20
Davis, who appointed a majority of the utilities commissioners, including=
=20
Lynch, was said to be fuming over Monday's announcement.=20
``It is still his hope and expectation that this matter can be resolved=20
within the existing rate structure,'' Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said.=
=20
Consumer advocates blasted the increase as a betrayal.=20
``It's obviously a huge disappointment for consumers,'' said Robert=20
Finkelstein, an attorney for The Utility Reform Network.=20
``Up to this time, the Davis administration and the PUC, in particular, had=
=20
made encouraging noises about getting the money out of the generators,''=20
Finkelstein said, referring to private companies charging high wholesale=20
rates for power. ``This draft decision seems to be an abandonment of that=
=20
position in favor of taking it out of the consumers' hides.''=20
But most state lawmakers have abandoned hope of avoiding higher consumer=20
rates. In recent weeks, they've seen negotiations to prop up the foundering=
=20
utilities stall and the administration's efforts to secure low-cost power=
=20
contracts fall far short of expectations.=20
Meanwhile, the state has been spending more than $1 billion a month buying=
=20
power for the major utilities, mostly on short-term markets, where prices=
=20
have risen eightfold.=20
``I don't think anybody is fooled about the inevitability of a rate=20
increase,'' said Assemblywoman Carole Migden, D-San Francisco.=20
Assembly Speaker pro tem Fred Keeley, D-Santa Cruz, a central figure in the=
=20
state's efforts to resolve the crisis, called Davis' rate-increase resistan=
ce=20
a noble but unrealistic goal.=20
``We are now past the time of pursuing noble goals,'' Keeley said. ``We are=
=20
at a time where it is important to problem-solve.''=20
Commissioners, who hastily drafted the rate increase over the weekend, said=
=20
it was needed to keep the major utilities from sinking into bankruptcy, whi=
ch=20
they fear could unravel the state's electric system. Pacific Gas & Electric=
=20
Co. and Southern California Edison have been nearly bankrupted by soaring=
=20
wholesale power costs that aren't covered by their state-frozen rates.=20
Officials at PG&E and Southern California Edison were combing through the=
=20
PUC's rate-increase proposal Monday. PG&E declined to comment.=20
Commissioners blamed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for failing t=
o=20
rein in wholesale power costs with price caps despite mounting evidence tha=
t=20
independent energy companies are gouging California consumers.=20
U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said a rate rise could ease approval =
of=20
legislation she is carrying that would force federal regulators to enact a=
=20
regional price cap.=20
``There has been some resistance by members of Congress who feel the people=
=20
of California have not fully faced up to the energy crisis,'' said Feinstei=
n=20
spokesman Howard Gantman.=20
The proposed rate increase of 3 cents per kilowatt-hour, along with the=20
1-cent increase in January, would push California residential rates over 15=
=20
cents, among the highest in the nation.=20
Rates will be based on how much electricity customers use. Power-pinching=
=20
residential consumers who use no more than 130 percent of their ``baseline'=
'=20
allotment, an amount based on regional climate, would see no further rate=
=20
increase at all. Poor customers who qualify for rate assistance also would =
be=20
exempted.=20
But PG&E residential customers who exceed 130 percent of the baseline --=20
currently more than half -- would see their bills rise 9 to 36 percent.=20
State regulators said they needed to quickly boost the utilities' revenues=
=20
with higher rates to keep small energy producers from cutting off supplies.=
=20
Another concern was that the utilities haven't paid the California Departme=
nt=20
of Water Resources for the power it has been buying since January for their=
=20
customers, draining billions from the state's general fund.=20
In approving the rate increase, regulators plan to order the utilities to p=
ay=20
the small generators and the state for their ongoing power costs, and to=20
reimburse the state for its past purchases.=20
PG&E and Edison have received some $400 million in additional revenue from=
=20
the earlier rate increase and now have more than $4 billion in the bank,=20
regulators said.=20
Even so, regulators say utilities still face a cash-flow problem. The new=
=20
increase will add $4.8 billion to their annual revenues.=20
The commission, however, is ordering the utilities only to pay power=20
companies for ongoing costs. It does not address the $1.5 billion owed to t=
he=20
small generators or the billions in debt to large power suppliers.=20
Lynch said no further rate increase should be necessary, and that consumers=
=20
could be refunded if investigations show they've been overcharged.=20

Gov. Davis' hard line against higher rates is fuel for challengers=20

BY DION NISSENBAUM AND HALLYE JORDAN=20

Mercury News Sacramento Bureau=20


SACRAMENTO -- The political sharks are starting to circle Gov. Gray Davis a=
s=20
the state's energy crisis threatens to drain the average Californian's=20
wallet.=20
With energy regulators -- most of them Davis appointees -- preparing today =
to=20
raise rates, opponents on his left and right are beginning to smell blood,=
=20
raising their hopes of making Davis the first one-term California governor =
in=20
more than 50 years.=20
Republican Secretary of State Bill Jones, sounding what is expected to be a=
=20
key theme, announced his long-expected plan Monday to challenge the=20
Democratic governor next year by accusing Davis of putting ``his head in th=
e=20
sand'' during the energy crisis.=20
Consumer groups are vowing a ``ratepayer revolt'' and ballot measure that=
=20
could batter Davis during his re-election campaign.=20
And Davis is facing the growing possibility that a member of his own party=
=20
may view the governor as vulnerable enough to challenge him for the=20
Democratic nomination.=20
``The political danger is in rates,'' said Mark DiCamillo, director of the=
=20
non-partisan Field Institute. ``That's when the political punch hits.=20
``If the rates rise and the governor hasn't been able to hold them back, hi=
s=20
standing would start to crumble.''=20
For weeks, Davis has been expressing his ``hope and expectation'' that ener=
gy=20
bills wouldn't need to rise more than the 20 percent that's already been=20
approved. He has sought to portray himself as a staunch defender of the=20
average Californian.=20
Once again, Monday, even as his own political appointees to the Public=20
Utilities Commission were proposing immediate and stunning rate hikes, Davi=
s=20
again expressed his ``hope and expectation'' that such a move would not be=
=20
necessary.=20
But as the crisis appears to worsen, there seem to be few people left,=20
including those on governor's own staff, who believe the problems can be=20
solved without asking Californians to pay more -- dramatically more -- for=
=20
power.=20
In some ways, Davis has painted himself into a corner much the way Presiden=
t=20
Bush hurt his 1992 re-election chances by breaking his ``no new taxes''=20
pledge.=20
Two options for Davis=20
Davis faces two options: oppose rate increases that nearly everyone else se=
es=20
as inevitable and take continuing hits for failing to lead, or reverse cour=
se=20
and face criticism for abandoning his longstanding opposition.=20
Either choice could hurt his political prospects -- both for governor and a=
s=20
a potential presidential candidate in 2004.=20
In the Capitol, some lawmakers, Democrats included, are becoming increasing=
ly=20
frustrated at his refusal to talk about raising rates and have begun to rai=
se=20
questions about his leadership.=20
Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Santa Cruz, called the governor's stand against=
=20
rate increases ``a noble goal,'' but added, ``We are now past the time of=
=20
pursuing noble goals.''=20
``One of the tools that will be absolutely necessary to solve this problem =
is=20
to raise rates,'' said Keeley, one of the Legislature's key energy=20
negotiators. ``To continue now to maintain the fiction that rates don't hav=
e=20
to go up will cause rates to go up more when they go up and will take longe=
r=20
to solve the problem.''=20
Another senior Democratic lawmaker likened the governor's position to=20
President Lyndon B. Johnson during the Vietnam War when the violent morass=
=20
engulfed his administration, created a national crisis and pressured him to=
=20
abandon his 1968 re-election bid.=20
``There will inevitably be people surfacing who will challenge the governor=
=20
from within the party,'' the lawmaker said.=20
Jones to challenge Davis=20
On Monday, Secretary of State Jones -- the only Republican in statewide=20
office -- said he would challenge Davis next year and used the energy crisi=
s=20
as his major hammer.=20
Jones told reporters in Sacramento that Davis turned a blind eye to=20
skyrocketing energy costs in San Diego last summer, an early warning that=
=20
could have helped the state avert the electrical mess.=20
``Instead, the governor chose not to have a bold, aggressive plan,'' Jones=
=20
said. ``He chose to basically put his head in the sand, and hope that the=
=20
problem would go away.''=20
But Davis still holds some commanding advantages. He has raised an=20
intimidating $26 million for his re-election campaign -- compared with=20
$118,000 for Jones. And he continues to receive strong support from=20
Californians in polls.=20
``I think that one of the reasons that the governor's public standing has=
=20
remained favorable is because the average person out there clearly=20
understands that he has been fighting the good fight on behalf of=20
ratepayers,'' said Garry South, the governor's chief political consultant.=
=20
Even so, more and more lawmakers are urging Davis to take more decisive ste=
ps=20
to bring the crisis under control, which could undermine the image of Davis=
=20
as a methodical, but sure-footed chief executive.=20
``I think the governor should peek out from behind the curtain'' and tell=

Californians what he intends to do to solve the crisis, said Assemblywoman=

Seeing the light in energy crisis=20
Tuesday, March 27, 2001=20
Reality finally seems to be breaking through a little on the electricity=20
crisis: "California's top power regulator proposed a 40 percent hike in=20
electricity rates Monday, saying such an increase should encourage customer=
s=20
to cut back on usage and conserve enough power to get through the hot summe=
r=20
months," AP reported yesterday.=20
"Loretta Lynch, president of the Public Utilities Commission, said rates=20
should increase by an average of 3 cents per kilowatt hour. The current rat=
e=20
averages 7.5 cents per kilowatt hour."
The PUC could vote as early as today to increase rates, with the effective=
=20
date as early as April 1. A rate hike of less than 40 percent also is=20
possible. Although Gov. Gray Davis continues publicly to oppose rate hikes,=
=20
Ms. Lynch is a close political associate of his and was appointed by him.=
=20
"It's a move in the right direction," Robert Michaels, a professor of=20
economics at Cal State Fullerton, told us. But he said he didn't know how=
=20
much prices should go up because of uncertainty in other areas. "Even in=20
Sacramento everybody is saying rates could double in a year. Nobody knows=
=20
what's being spent by the state on short-term energy. Or long-term energy. =
Or=20
knows all the unknowns of the long-term contracts" the state signed earlier=
=20
this month.=20
A 40 percent rate increase also wouldn't cover "all the things from the pas=
t=20
- the bills the utilities have to pay" to the independent electricity=20
generators. But there is one positive aspect, he said: "It will convince=20
consumers that there really is a scarcity in electricity."=20
Unfortunately, a rate increase could come in a politically manipulated form=
.=20
"Gov. Gray Davis, faced with the near inevitability of raising consumers'=
=20
electricity bills, is leaning toward a rate system whereby those who use mo=
re=20
power pay more than those who conserve," reported the San Francisco=20
Chronicle. "Sources close to the governor said he is being lobbied by his o=
wn=20
staff members to accept a so-called structured rate system."
"I am a fan of restructuring rates to exempt conservation," Ms. Lynch told=
=20
the Chronicle. "People who use a whole lot of power should pay more."
"It's an idea we can use rates to redistribute wealth," Mr. Michaels said. =
He=20
also pointed out that the crisis really doesn't involve large, industrial=
=20
users, who use a mostly constant amount of electricity in their business an=
d=20
manufacturing processes year-round. Rather, the problem mainly is with=20
residences, which comprise one-third of usage but which are the "main users=
=20
of the peak time, the evening, when air conditioning is turned on."
Can't the state politicians look beyond the current crisis, for once? As th=
e=20
state heads into a recession, do we really want to charge more to large=20
electricity users, such as businesses? And what if the many new Internet=20
"server" businesses can't cut power, just to name one industry? Businesses=
=20
would begin avoiding this state like a cow avoids an electric fence.
And what about people who stay home because they're retired, sick or for so=
me=20
other reason? Should they pay more if they can't cut back? We don't charge=
=20
more for gasoline for people who drive 50 miles to work than for people who=
=20
drive 10 miles. Why should electricity be different?
Even as the state moves toward more rational pricing of electricity, the=20
mistake would be compounded by a rate structure that might be difficult to=
=20
dismantle as more power plants come on line and the crisis passes.
Finally, this crisis began with a flawed approach to free markets, misnamed=
=20
deregulation, and last fall deepened quickly as Gov. Davis and the=20
Legislature responded with every possible government solution that might=20
avoid the inevitable - higher electric rates. Now, the state faces the wors=
t=20
of all possible worlds: a future with high electrcity prices, inadequate=20
power production particularly for summer, a massive debt for power bills ow=
ed=20
and a potential large deficit blown through what was once a state budget wi=
th=20
a surplus.

By KATE BERRY
The Orange County Register=20
California's top electricity regulator Monday proposed a rate increase of a=
s=20
much as 36 percent that would be shouldered primarily by businesses and=20
energy-guzzling consumers.=20
The plan by Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities=20
Commission, would attempt to solve part of the state's energy crisis by=20
raising electricity rates 3 cents per kilowatt-hour. The plan is expected t=
o=20
be approved by the commission today.=20
The increase would later be subjected to a tiered-rate structure so that th=
e=20
more consumers use, the more they would pay, Lynch said.=20
"Electricity hogs will need to pay more for the energy they use this=20
summer,'' Lynch said at a news conference.=20
About 40 percent of residential customers would not be hit by any rate=20
increase, Lynch said, because their usage is 130 percent or less of=20
"baseline," a subsistence level that varies regionally in the state.=20
Consumers who use between 130 percent and 200 percent of baseline would fac=
e=20
increases of as much as 9 percent, while those who use more than 200 percen=
t=20
of baseline would pay the biggest increases.=20
Since January, the state has put itself in the precarious position of buyin=
g=20
power for the utilities at a rate of $45 million to $66 million a day - wit=
h=20
no mechanism to recoup the funds.=20
The rate increase would pay for the state's current and future power=20
purchases - which are estimated at $23 billion through 2002. It also would=
=20
cover power purchases from independent producers, known as qualifying=20
facilities, whose unwillingness to operate without being paid contributed t=
o=20
last week's rolling blackouts.=20
The proposed rate increase would come on top of January's increase of 9=20

that "it is his hope and expectation that this matter can be resolved withi=
