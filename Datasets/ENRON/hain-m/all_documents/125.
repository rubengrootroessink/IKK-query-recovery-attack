Please remove me from this list.? My email address on the list is: 
m.lamoureux@ieee.org 
I presume this list can be configured to only reply to sender, instead of 
everyone on the list.? With the latter being the apparent case at the moment, 
everyone please forgive my contribution to the large number of emails.
