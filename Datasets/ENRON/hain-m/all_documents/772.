Here is a status update fron Nevada Power on our transmission service 
request. I wouldn't hazard a guess as to whether "very soon" means next week, 
but they seem to be working on our request.

We've completed some studies, but still need to check on a case or two.
Hope to have a breif system impact study report out to you very soon.

Spoke w/ Ops and they indicated the letter will likely go out on 3/19/01.

Larry, I'm checking on the status of the study for our transmission service
request. Per your e-mail below, can we still expect to receive the results
in the immediate future?

Also, Marty had indicated in a March 5th e-mail that we could expect to
receive by March 9 the documentation we had requested of Nevada Power's
policy precluding use of a remedial action scheme in lieu of
reconductoring. What is the status of Nevada Power's Operating Department
in providing that documentation?

Thanks, Larry.

Don-

We'll communicate the results of our analysis regarding your transmission
application by next week.  Per my discussion w/ Brian, we will evaluate
your
request under the premise that the terms of the service may extend beyond 1
year.  We will model all the valid transmission service requests ahead of
ENRON's request in the study.

By now, you should have received Marty's revision to the ENRON plant
interconnection scope. If you have any questions, please drop me a line.

Larry Luna
