I am looking at my physical volume report, and have a couple questions about 
the totals


If I take the total volume, and multiply that by the total hours, I get a 
total of 318,557,665,950.40 mwh.    Is this what was physically flowing?  If 
so, then I think this number is wrong.  If this is our total volume, then I 
am worried because I thought we were just reporting our physical flows.

Can you clear this up for me?
