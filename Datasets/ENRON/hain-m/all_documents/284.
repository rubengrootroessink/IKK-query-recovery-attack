EEI's State Restructuring Service has expanded its coverage of the California 
Energy Crisis and put all its email Action Alerts and a new Chronology of 
Crisis events in one place on its Web site.  As part of your subscription to 
the State Restructuring Web site, you get:

o A regularly updated chronology of crisis events
o All laws responding to the crisis, including important regulatory and court 
decisions
o News of legal, financial, grid operations, federal, and regional 
perspectives
o E-mail notification of noteworthy events

Updated as policy actions and operating events are reported, this is one 
resource you don't want to miss as the crisis heads into the summer!

EEI's State Restructuring Service continues to be your one-stop electronic 
resource for complete information on all the other states that are 
restructuring, including those that are delaying their processes out of 
concern over California's experience.

Consisting of access to our Web-based resource and an e-mail alert service, 
this yearly subscription provides you with timely briefs on important state 
regulatory, legislative, and judicial actions, full analyses of the most 
important policies, and comprehensive background on existing policies of 
restructuring states.

To see a free sample of Action Alerts recently added to the Web site on 
restructuring events in all states, including California, please visit this
