In the next few days, 250 randomly selected U.S.-based employees will receive 
Fortune's "100 Best Companies to Work for in America" survey.  Check your 
home mailbox.  You could be one of the lucky ones to receive this very 
important survey.

The input you provide in this survey is the most important element in the 
evaluation process.  Your honest and open responses, as well as written 
comments about your personal Enron experiences, will help Fortune gain an 
insider's viewpoint. 

So look for the survey in your home mailbox.  Thanks for your participation.
