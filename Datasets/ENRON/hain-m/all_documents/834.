PX's Compliance Filing.  Please forward this draft to any other Enron

Here are supplemental comments that incorporate Tim Belden's additional
comments per request of Steve Hall (for background, see his email of 3/9).

Kimberly or Ron: could you prepare into formal supplemental comments and we
can circulate that version to commercial folks?

Mary Hain, Steve Hall:  please read and make sure this works for you on a
substantive level.  Note that I do not ask for the exact pieces of
information identified by Steve because (1) the breakpoint price is self
evident and (2) the pay-as-bid prices are confidential although we can ask
for the average.

Alan
