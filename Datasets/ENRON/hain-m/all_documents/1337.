A few thoughts:

First, I think it's dangerous for me to walk into any of the PNW Senator or 
Congressman's offices and talk about our interests in legislation on the 
retail side.  Their key focus will be BPA and you (not me) are clearly the 
expert on those issues.  I am planning on handling (or others in the Western 
States Group will handle) non-PNW states, but I think it makes more sense 
for  you to meet with the PNW folks (either with me or without me) because of 
their focus on BPA issues. 

Second, since you are already working so closely with Congressional staffers, 
it may not be necessary to visit with the Senators and Congressmen when 
they're home.  

The only reason to do so, is that you do get better access to the members 
themselves when they're home.   In this regard, you may want to talk with 
Cynthia and Craig Gannett about a visit with Slade Gorton, Gordon Smith, and 
Ron Wyden.  

I've met Smith (who probably won't remember me) and had dinner with Wyden at 
former law partner's house (so he may remember me)--let me know what you 
think.   I'd be happy to join you and talk about state issues, but it only 
makes sense in my mind if you are their to talk about BPA stuff.
