Joe or Jim, how do we "coordinate" with Richard Sanders on this stuff most 
effectively?  Or do we need to on this?

		 Subject: Zycher Paper

BAsed on the conference call we just completed, Ben Zycher will be preparing 
a revised version of his draft paper which will be circulated later today.
 
You should return any comments, in a redlined format, directly to Ben, as he 
will maintain document control of his paper.  Comments will be appreciated as 
soon as possible, but no later than close of business tomorrow.
 
Meanwhile, I will be significantly redoing the draft filing sent out 
yesterday.  It will highlight Ben's findings and attach his paper to our 
filing, which will focus on policy and operational issues raised by the FERC 
staff proposal.  It will go out later tonight and, as with Ben's paper, 
comments will be required no later than close of business Wednesday.
 
In connection with that, I have redceived the draft Williams comments.  Any 
other WPTF member who is planning to file should also send me as soon as 
possible the latest version of your proposed comments, so that I can avoid 
any inconsistent staments in the WPTF filing and support some of the 
positions you are taking.  Thanks!
 
Dan
