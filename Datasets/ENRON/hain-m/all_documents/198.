Hello, RRG members and other interested  parties.
?
As many of you know already, FERC issued on combined order  on the RTO West 
and TransConnect proposal filings on April 26, 2001 (Docket Nos.  RT01-35-000 
and RT01-15-000).
?
Because it can sometimes be difficult to retrieve  documents from the FERC 
Website, we have posted the FERC order (and related  press release) on the 
RTO West Website, both on the RTO West proposal filing  page and on the 
TransConnect proposal filing page.? Those links  are:
?
http://208.55.67.64/Index_Page_RTOWest_FilingUtilities_FERCDocs.htm
?
http://208.55.67.64/Index_Page_TransConnect_Filing.htm
?
Because FERC's April 26 order relating to  a?mitigation and market monitoring 
plan for the California wholesale  electricity markets may also be of 
interest,?we have?posted that  order?and its related press release (in Docket 
No. EL00-95-012, as well as  others) on the Webpage RTO West?set up for 
selected FERC orders and filings  related to California.? That link is at:
?
http://208.55.67.64/FERC_CalOrders.htm
?
Finally,?Avista, Bonneville, Puget Sound Energy, and  Sierra Pacific and 
Nevada Power have made their filings in FERC Docket No.  EL01-47-000 (the 
"Removing Obstacles" docket) available on the RTO West  Website.? Those 
filings are posted at:

Thank you very much!
