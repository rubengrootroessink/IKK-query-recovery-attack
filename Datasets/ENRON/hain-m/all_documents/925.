  Recent occurrences of missing PMI Information and
observations regarding today's 10 minute price data:

* We experienced difficulty with BEEP last evening (3/6/01) with
interval 6 of HE24. The Ex-post Market Information for HE24 and the 10
minute price data for Hour 24 interval 6 is not presently available on
either the OASIS or SI/PMI sites.

* On Monday (3/5/01),  We experienced system difficulty with the SI
system which prohibited us from completing the Hour 18 automated real-time
processes.  Therefore, ex-post data for Intervals 1-3 in the Ex-post 10
minute price information and Ex-post market information for Hour 18 is also
not currently available.

    We expect to publish this missing data later
today, and barring any unforeseen delays, will provide notification upon
completion of the re-publication of the missing data.

* Also, we have observed  in the 10 minute price data for TODAY for
Hour 06:00 Intervals 1 and 2 a negative INC/DEC price (-5.17) is present.
We have verified that this information does reflect the actual dispatches
and is correct.
