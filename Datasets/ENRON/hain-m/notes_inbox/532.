Background

The ISO presently uses the SLIC application in that Outage Coordination
operators manually enter outage information gathered from market
participants via fax, e-mail or phone call.  However, during the recent
power crisis, it was determined that several smaller units were actually out
of service simultaneously with other major outages and the lack of
coordination caused serious operational problems that could have been
avoided had the ISO had forehand knowledge of the market participant
requirements.  As a result, Executive Order D-23-01 was created by Governor
Gray Davis to enhance management of the ISO controlled grid by ordering the
ISO to request and coordinate the information of all generating facilities
within the state of California capable of providing 10MW of power or more.

In response to the critical problem at hand, the re-design and development
of a web-interface SLIC application was implemented to address the way the
outage information is collected and processed. This re-design proposes to
automate as much as possible the verification, management and processing of
outage requests and related information, with the objective of reducing
workload and eliminating the generation of errors.


How to Register as a SLIC user:

To connect to the ISO's SLIC system, all Outage Coordinators and Scheduling
Coordinators must first register their company information as well as
identify a person from within their company to act as a primary contact with
the ISO. The primary contact will be responsible for identifying personnel
from within their company who will be using SLIC and will require digital
certificates.

To register, please do the following:

* Complete and return the attached forms to the ISO (refer to return
address on page 2)

* Upon receipt and verification of this form, the ISO will forward a
Digital Certificate Request Form to the primary contact person identified
from within your company.

* The primary contact will then complete, and e-mail, the Digital
Certificate Request Form back to the ISO, identifying the personnel from
within their company requiring digital certificates.

* The ISO will process the requested Digital Certificates within 10
working days and Fed Ex them, along with the instructions for their use, to
the primary contact in your company.  Detailed instructions on using the
SLIC application will also be included in this mailing.


Full documentation for the program is being developed. The documentation
will include an implementation plan and user instructions. It is highly
important that we begin the security process as a soon as possible. Please
complete and return the forms by cob Friday, March 23,2001.
