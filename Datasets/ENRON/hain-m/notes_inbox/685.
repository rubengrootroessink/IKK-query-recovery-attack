Our current assumption is that we cannot file this Answer in Opposition until 
the automatic stay is modified.  We sent this draft out yesterday evening 
that so we could get the OK from all the parties joining this answer, so that 
we could be in a position to file as soon as the stay is modified.

Kim-- how does this relate to the CalPx bankruptcy? Does the automatic stay
affect this? I would like to check with bankruptcy counsel?
