Mary, did you get this forwarded to Nevada/Sierra? If not, could you please 
do so ASAP? We need to keep this moving with all possible speed. I could do 
this for you, but you have been the principal contact on the Agreement for 
continuity. Let me know if there is something I could do. Also, as we 
discussed the other day, we should be trying to set up a meeting with 
Nevada/Sierra as soon as practicable to work through open items.

Thanks, Mary. If this is already done, let me know.
