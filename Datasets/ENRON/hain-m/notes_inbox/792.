  Owners of Generation Within the State of California:
  On February 8, 2001, the Honorable Gray Davis, Governor of
the State of California, issued Executive Order D-23-01.  For your
reference, an Internet link to a copy of D-23-01 can be found on the
California Independent System Operator (ISO) homepage (www.caiso.com)
<http://www.caiso.com)> .  In that Executive Order, the ISO is directed to
require generators to submit their outage schedules to the ISO.  With those
schedules, the ISO is charged with preparing a coordinated generator outage
plan, and updating it quarterly.
  At the Stakeholder Meeting co-hosted by the ISO and the
Electricity Oversight Board on March 1, 2001, stakeholders expressed great
interest in the process which would ultimately be used by the ISO to meet
the needs of Executive Order D-23-01.  As we receive input from stakeholders
on their concerns in developing the outage coordination process relative to
D-23-01,  we will address those concerns and share the formal outage
coordination procedure when it is available.  Meanwhile, it is critical to
gather outage information to:
1. meet the immediate needs of D-23-01 while more extensive procedures
are being developed for the ultimate coordination process;
2. gain a better understanding of the potential scope of the
coordinated plan as described in D-23-01; and
3. offer to the EOB (as soon in the development process as possible) a
"work-in-progress" for their comment relative to meeting the needs of
D-23-01.
  Accordingly, if you have not already done so, please forward
your existing generator outage plans to the ISO by April 1, 2001.  The
initial report should cover your outage plans from now through December 31,
2001.  Further, in order to permit the ISO to prepare a quarterly state-wide
generator outage plan in accordance with D-23-01, we also ask that you
forward to the ISO by the fifteenth day of each subsequent quarter, starting
on April 15, 2001, your planned outages for the following twelve months.  In
this way, we can prepare a "rolling" twelve-month outage plan as ordered by
D-23-01.  Finally, we ask that you notify the ISO of any subsequent changes
to your latest quarterly submission.
  Until further notice, please forward your Twelve-Month
Generator Outage Plans and updates electronically as a Microsoft Excel file
or other compatible spreadsheet attached to an e-mail addressed to
outage.folsom@caiso.com <mailto:outage.folsom@caiso.com>  with "Generator
Twelve-Month Outage Plan" in the subject line. Each planned outage or
curtailment should include the following information:
  Generator Outage Information
* Resource/Unit Name and Number, as applicable (e.g., Alamitos Unit 2)
* Location (city or county)
* Scheduling Coordinator (as applicable)
* Owner
* Unit Maximum MW (i.e., without curtailment)
* MW available during outage
* MW unavailable during outage
* Equipment out of service (if entire unit, indicate "Unit Out of
Service", if only a partial curtailment, note equipment out of service
causing most restrictive curtailment)
* Cause (note the work being done)
* Date and time scheduled out of service or unavailable for service
* Date and time schedule to return to service or available for service
* Time required for emergency return to service if different from
scheduled return
* Contact person, phone number, and e-mail address
  The ISO plans to transition toward a "web-based" submittal
system compatible with the ISO Database Logging system known as SLIC.  We
will advise you when the method for submittal of outage information changes.

  The ISO appreciates very much your cooperation in this
effort.  Should you have any questions, please contact me by e-mail
(gvanpelt@caiso.com) <mailto:gvanpelt@caiso.com)> .
  Thank you,
  Gregory Van Pelt
