You have been added to the RRGA-L mailing list (RTO West Congestion Model
Content Group) by Keith Dalia <kadalia@BPA.GOV>.

Please save this message for future ?reference, especially if this is the
first time you subscribe to an ?electronic mailing list. If you ever need
to ?leave the ?list, ?you ?will find ?the ?necessary instructions ?below.
Perhaps ?more importantly, ?saving a ?copy of ?this message ?(and of ?all
future subscription notices ?from other mailing lists) in ?a special mail
folder will give you instant access to the list of mailing lists that you
are subscribed ?to. This may ?prove very useful the ?next time you ?go on
vacation and ?need to leave ?the lists temporarily so ?as not to ?fill up
your ?mailbox while ?you ?are away! ?You should ?also ?save the ?"welcome
messages" from the ?list owners that you will ?occasionally receive after
subscribing to a new list.

To send ?a message to ?all the people ?currently subscribed to ?the list,
just send mail ?to RRGA-L@LIST.RTOWEST.ORG. This is ?called "sending mail
to the ?list", because ?you send ?mail to a ?single address ?and LISTSERV
makes ?copies ?for all ?the ?people ?who ?have subscribed. ?This ?address
(RRGA-L@LIST.RTOWEST.ORG) ?is also ?called the ?"list address". ?You must
never try to send any command to that address, as it would be distributed
to all the people ?who have subscribed. All commands must ?be sent to the
"LISTSERV ?address", ? LISTSERV@LIST.RTOWEST.ORG. ?It ? is ?very
important to understand ?the difference between the ?two, but fortunately
it is ?not complicated. The ?LISTSERV address is ?like a FAX ?number that
connects you ?to a ?machine, whereas ?the list address ?is like ?a normal
voice line connecting you to a person. If you make a mistake and dial the
FAX number ?when you ?wanted to talk ?to someone on ?the phone, ?you will
quickly realize ?that you used the ?wrong number and call ?again. No harm
will have been done. If on the ?other hand you accidentally make your FAX
call ?someone's ?voice ?line, ?the ?person receiving ?the ?call ?will ?be
inconvenienced, especially if your FAX then re-dials every 5 minutes. The
fact that ?most people ?will eventually ?connect the ?FAX machine ?to the
voice line to ?allow the FAX to ?go through and make the ?calls stop does
not mean ?that you ?should continue ?to send FAXes ?to the ?voice number.
People would just get mad at you. ?It works pretty much the same way with
mailing ?lists, with ?the difference ?that ?you are ?calling hundreds ?or
thousands of people ?at the same time, and consequently ?you can expect a
lot of people to get upset if ?you consistently send commands to the list
address.

You may leave the list at any ?time by sending a "SIGNOFF RRGA-L" command
to LISTSERV@LIST.RTOWEST.ORG. You can also tell LISTSERV how you
want it to confirm ?the receipt of messages you send to ?the list. If you
do not trust ?the system, send a "SET RRGA-L ?REPRO" command and LISTSERV
will send you a ?copy of your own messages, so that you ?can see that the
message was distributed and did not get damaged on the way. After a while
you ?may find ?that this ?is getting ?annoying, especially ?if your ?mail
program does not ?tell you that the ?message is from you ?when it informs
you that new mail has arrived from ?RRGA-L. If you send a "SET RRGA-L ACK
NOREPRO" command, LISTSERV will mail you a short acknowledgement instead,
which ?will look ?different in ?your ?mailbox directory. ?With most ?mail
programs you ?will know immediately ?that this is an ?acknowledgement you
can read ?later. Finally, ?you can ?turn off ?acknowledgements completely
with "SET RRGA-L NOACK NOREPRO".

Following ?instructions from ?the list ?owner, your ?subscription options
have been set to "NOFILES REPRO" rather than the usual LISTSERV defaults.
For more ?information about subscription ?options, send a ?"QUERY RRGA-L"
command to LISTSERV@LIST.RTOWEST.ORG.

Contributions sent to this list are automatically archived. You can get a
list of the available archive files ?by sending an "INDEX RRGA-L" command
to ?LISTSERV@LIST.RTOWEST.ORG. You ?can then ?order these ?files
with a "GET RRGA-L LOGxxxx" ?command, or using LISTSERV's database search
facilities. Send an ?"INFO DATABASE" command for more ?information on the
latter.

This ?list is ?available ?in digest ?form. ?If you ?wish ?to receive ?the
digested version of the postings, just issue a SET RRGA-L DIGEST command.

Please note that ?it is presently possible for other ?people to determine
that ?you are ?signed up ?to the ?list through ?the use ?of the ?"REVIEW"
command, ?which ?returns ? the ?e-mail ?address ?and ?name ? of ?all ?the
subscribers. If ?you do not ?want your name to ?be visible, just ?issue a
"SET RRGA-L CONCEAL" command.

More ?information on ?LISTSERV ?commands ?can be ?found ?in the ?LISTSERV
reference ?card, which ?you can ?retrieve ?by sending ?an "INFO ?REFCARD"
command to LISTSERV@LIST.RTOWEST.ORG.
