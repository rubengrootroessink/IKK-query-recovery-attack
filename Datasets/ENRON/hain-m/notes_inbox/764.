Thanks for the prompt work, John.  We are going through the agreement now, 
and will get back to you soon.

Your comments are helpful.  I look forward to talking with you and your group 
about options for moving the agreement through on an expedited basis under 
NPC's tariffs.

I will be in Houston and Las Vegas for the first part of this week, but will 
try to get in touch with you from there.

Attached is our initial markup of the above, together with a blackline 
against the new draft you provided from Nevada Power (please open the 
documents as soon as you can so we can be sure they will do so as there were 
some conversion issues to our system - ignore the table of contents, etc., 
for now).  This is still somewhat rough and will need considerable input from 
Don Hammond on the technical issues.  We did not make any changes to the 
schedules and attachments this turn on the assumption that these will be 
addressed as we go forward (and are quite skeletal at this point in any 
case).  We did endeavor to capture most of Mary Hain's comments from the 
prior email but as the new draft is so different from the prior one I am not 
sure we succeeded in all respects.  The good news, of course, is that the new 
draft they sent is vastly superior to the old one for this application.  We 
have tried not to make many "redrafting" changes but let us know if there is 
anything you feel we should revisit.  We are continuing to review some items 
for further changes.  Please note that there are questions in bold in the 
draft which are directed to ENA personnel and internal counsel and are not 
for distribution to Nevada Power and therefore this draft needs to be revised 
by us before it goes out to anyone outside of Enron.  I apologize again for 
the delay in getting this to you but it has been extremely busy hereabouts of 
late.  Please let me know when you'd like to discuss.  I can be reached in 
our San Francisco office after about 10:00 am SF time tomorrow (415-951-1100) 
but should be back in Denver on Friday.  JM
