Greetings,?members of the RTO West Stage 2 Tariff  Integration Group.
?
As those of you who were able to attend the RRG meeting on  March 23 may 
recall, we received a number of suggestions that the Stage 2 work  process be 
restructured to a more sequenced approach.? That is, in the near  term we 
should focus on key critical path tasks and then return to additional  work 
efforts once the critical path items have been more fully  developed.
?
In response to these suggestions, we have substantially  revised the RTO West 
meeting calendar for the remainder of March and for the  entire month of 
April.? The revised calendar has now been posted on the RTO  West Stage 2 
Main Page, which you can view by clicking on the link  below:

?
The specific effect this near-term re-focusing will have on the Tariff  
Integration Group is that?tariff work will be suspended for a time while  
other work takes?first priority.? The Tariff Integration Group  meetings 
previously scheduled for April 4 and April?18 have been  canceled.? The March 
30 conference call that was set up specifically to  discuss ADR will be held 
as planned, however.? If you would like to join  that conference call, it 
will be on Friday, March 30 from 9:30 a.m. to 12:30  p.m. Pacific Time.??The 
dial-in will be 503-813-5808, passcode  964949.
?
I apologize if these changes cause you any inconvenience.?  We?appreciate the 
valuable contributions and dedication you have already  brought to this 
process, and we look forward to getting back to?work with  all of you as soon 
as some of the other critical path items have gotten more  fully developed.
?
Thank you very much!
?
- Sarah?
