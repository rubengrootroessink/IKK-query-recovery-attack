  ISO Market Participants:
  The ISO has posted on its web site a white paper and draft
Tariff language regarding its proposed New Facility Interconnection Policy
(NFIP).  You can find these documents at
http://www.caiso.com/docs/2001/03/05/200103051825008351.html
<http://www.caiso.com/docs/2001/03/05/200103051825008351.html> . These
documents will be the basis of the stakeholder meeting scheduled for Monday,
March 19.
  If, as you review these documents, you have questions or
comments that you would like to have addressed on March 19th, please send
them to me and to Steve Greenleaf (sgreenleaf@caiso.com
<mailto:sgreenleaf@caiso.com> ) by close of business on Wednesday, March 14.
(In your e-mail, use "NFIP Comments" in the subject line.)  We will do our
best to address whatever issues we receive by then.
  The ISO will present an informational briefing on the NFIP
proposal to the Governing Board on March 15.  We will then bring the issue
to them for a decision at their March 30 meeting.  Finally, FERC has
directed the ISO to submit a compliance filing with its NFIP proposal by
April 2.
