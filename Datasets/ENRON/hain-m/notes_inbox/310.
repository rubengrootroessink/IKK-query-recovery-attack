Ms. Hain - 

 Jim Steffes has asked that I help put together the ENA Government Affairs 
Report.  The concept is to make the report a forward document as well as 
reporting on items that have occurred.  The report is due to ENA management 
the first week of each month.

 Please provide information on the current status and upcoming events for the 
following projects by Friday, March 2, 2001.  The report currently indicates 
the following:

PROJECT	KEY ISSUES	STRATEGIES/COMMENTS/NEXT ACTIONS
Antelope Valley	Interconnect ion Agreement.	Reviewing agreement for consistency with business 
objectives and FERC requirements.
		

 Please advise of any questions, comments or concerns.  I can be reached at 
713-853-1711.
