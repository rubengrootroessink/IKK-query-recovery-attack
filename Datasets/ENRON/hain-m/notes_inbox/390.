Greetings, members of the RTO West Stage 2 Tariff  Integration Group!

Attached to this e-mail please find an updated "work  tracking document" to 
follow up on our March 21, 2001 Tariff Integration Group  meeting.? The

At the end of the week after I have received a few items  from other members 
of the group, I will post an updated version of the Tariff  working document 
(including the work we did on the general provisions section at  the March 21 
meeting).
?
Thank you very much!
