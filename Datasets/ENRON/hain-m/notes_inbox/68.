Hello, Everyone -

The RTO West Regional Representatives Group (RRG) meeting tentatively
scheduled for Friday, June 15, has been cancelled.  Good progress continues
to be made on congestion management, planning, pricing, liability, and
"seams" issues.  Additional development of these issues by the work groups
is necessary before they will be ready for RRG consideration.  Thanks, too,
for the suggestions several of you have given us for potential consultants
for the cost-benefit analysis.

Assuming no major conflicts, we have tentatively scheduled Friday, June 29,
for the next RRG meeting.  We will confirm or re-schedule this June 29
meeting date as soon as we can.

Have a pleasant weekend.

- Bud
