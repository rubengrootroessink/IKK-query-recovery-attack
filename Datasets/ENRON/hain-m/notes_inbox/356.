California Regulators Approve Massive Rate Increase:
Who Benefits and Who Doesn't?

by Will McNamara=20
Director, Electric Industry Analysis

California regulators earlier this week approved electricity rate increases=
=20
topping 40 percent, the largest in the state's history. The California Publ=
ic=20
Utilities Commission (CPUC) voted unanimously to raise rates by 3 cents /=
=20
KWh. The rate hikes, which take effect immediately but won't appear on=20
customer bills until May, apply to millions of customers of Southern=20
California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric, the state's two largest=20
utilities. Low-income residents are exempt from the increases. =20

Analysis: For context, keep in mind that it was only two months ago that th=
e=20
CPUC approved its first rate increase in response to the staggering debt of=
=20
SCE and PGOand other factors related to the California energy crisis.  In=
=20
early January, the CPUC approved temporary rate hikes of 9 percent for=20
residential customers (about $5 a month for the average customer) and 7 to =
15=20
percent for businesses. The temporary increases were only to remain in effe=
ct=20
for 90 days and will be expiring shortly. At that time, both PGOand SCE=20
denounced the temporary increase, which was not surprising considering that=
=20
the 9 to 15 percent increase was much lower than the utilities had requeste=
d=20
(PGOasked for a 26-percent increase and SCE had asked for 30 percent). The=
=20
January rate increase was followed by an additional 10-percent increase tha=
t=20
is set to take effect next year. =20

The CPUC's current ruling increases rates by about 42 percent at SCE and 46=
=20
percent at PG&E. However, the CPUC's measure will most likely serve to=20
benefit the state more than SCE or PG&E. The CPUC clearly established that=
=20
none of the additional revenue earned from the rate increases can be used b=
y=20
the utilities to pay for past power purchase costs, which have amounted to=
=20
about $13 billion. In addition, the CPUC adopted a proposal by consumer gro=
up=20
Toward Utility Rate Normalization (TURN) that a rate cap preventing the=20
utilities from charging market rates should be extended. In other words, th=
e=20
portion of the electric rates that PGOand SCE actually receive from=20
ratepayers will remain frozen for the foreseeable future. The CPUC has=20
established that the utilities must still recover billions of dollars in=20
stranded costs before the rate freeze can be lifted. =20

Thus, it appears that most of the revenue accumulated from the rate increas=
es=20
will be used to reimburse the state of California for the power purchases i=
t=20
continues to make on behalf of the utilities and will not be used to pay of=
f=20
any existing debt held by the utilities. PGOalready has responded that the=
=20
CPUC ruling attempts to "completely change the ratemaking rules that are us=
ed=20
to determine the end of the rate freeze under AB1890." PGOhas said that it=
=20
will challenge this and other aspects of the CPUC ruling.=20

However, even though most of the money from the rate increases will go to t=
he=20
state, it is also not presently clear if the increases will be sufficient t=
o=20
reimburse California for the $4 billion it has already spent to procure=20
power, or compensate for the anticipated $14 billion that it will have to p=
ay=20
for power this year. Some of the funds generated by the rate increases must=
=20
be used by PGOand SCE to pay for power that they still obtain from supplier=
s=20
or to cover costs for their own power generation. Consequently, the CPUC ha=
s=20
left open the possibility that additional rate increases may be necessary. =
=20

Although it is still being evaluated how individual customer classes will b=
e=20
impacted by the rate increases, it is fairly clear that large commercial an=
d=20
industrial customers will end up paying the most.  Loretta Lynch, president=
=20
of the CPUC, maintained that an underlying goal of the increase is to force=
=20
what she referred to as "electricity hogs," or those people who excessively=
=20
use power without concern for the state's supply shortage, to conserve. Lyn=
ch=20
has said that conservation is the key to staving off additional rate hikes,=
=20
and that the higher rates should put financial pressure on Californians to=
=20
conserve energy, which theoretically should help to reduce the risk of=20
blackouts in the state this summer. The average residential cost for a=20
kilowatt hour is about 12.5 cents for SCE customers and 10.5 cents for=20
PGOcustomers. The new rate increase will add about 3 cents / KWh for the=20
customers of both utilities, which as noted averages out to about a=20
42-percent increase at SCE and a 46-percent increase at PGO(for electricity=
=20
alone). =20

However, Lynch also established that a "tiered" pricing structure, which ha=
s=20
yet to be fully determined, will be put into place. The tiered pricing syst=
em=20
will reward customers who conserve energy and penalize those who do not.=20
Essentially this means that those customers who use the most power will=20
ultimately pay the most, and could face additional rate increases this year=
,=20
which the CPUC did not rule out as a possibility. Under a tiered pricing=20
structure, those customers who conserve on their power usage may not see=20
their bills increase beyond the rate increase approved this week. =20

The CPUC also ruled that PGOand SCE must pay small independent generators i=
n=20
the state (known as qualifying facilities) for energy within 15 days of=20
delivery. Over the last week, California has again issued Stage 3=20
emergencies, signaling that power reserves have fallen to dangerously low=
=20
levels. Contributing to the problem is the fact that QFs have stopped=20
producing in recent weeks as a result of the financial problems of PGOand S=
CE=20
and the fact that they have been paid only a small percentage of what they=
=20
are owed for power previously produced. Under normal circumstances, the QFs=
=20
can generate as much as 30 percent of the state's electricity needs. The CP=
UC=20
ruled that PGOand SCE must pay the QFs within 15 days of the end of a billi=
ng=20
period, or suffer from penalties equal to the amount of their outstanding=
=20
payment.=20

Gray Davis, who throughout his tenure as California's governor assured=20
Californians that rates would not be increased, attempted to distance himse=
lf=20
from the CPUC's ruling, and in fact issued a statement that he has no contr=
ol=20
over the commission's decision. Further, Davis said that the rate increase=
=20
was "premature" because the state is still evaluating the financial numbers=
=20
that are needed to make a sound decision. In turn, the CPUC's Lynch=20
criticized both the governor and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission=
=20
(FERC) for "failing to act" on energy rates up to this point.=20

In addition to its comments regarding the rate freeze, PGOresponded with a=
=20
mixed reaction to the CPUC's ruling on the rate increase. On one hand, the=
=20
utility said the ruling offered a "welcome dose of realism." However, the=
=20
utility also said that the rate increase "does not offer a comprehensive=20
solution, fails to resolve the uncertainty of the crisis and may even creat=
e=20
more instability." Based on previous statements that PGOhas made, the utili=
ty=20
believes that the state's fundamental problem has its origins in the=20
wholesale market, where prices have often exceeded $300/MWh. =20

Some power generators, many of whom have been lambasted by California and=
=20
federal regulators for alleged price gouging, went on record with a favorab=
le=20
response to the rate increases. Jeffrey Skilling, Enron's CEO, said, "There=
's=20
been a need to balance supply and demand [in California] and to date I don'=
t=20
think anyone has been willing to let the prices rise to help balance supply=
=20
and demand. So [the increases] are a huge step forward in reducing the odds=
=20
of shortfalls."  Keith Bailey, chairman and CEO of Williams, told Reuters=
=20
that he thought the CPUC's rate increase was a rational decision and=20
something that the industry has been suggesting for some time. =20

Naturally, many consumer activists reacted vehemently against the rate=20
increases and protested during the CPUC's proceedings. The main argument of=
=20
the consumer groups is that the CPUC, the governor and FERC have not=20
fulfilled their regulatory responsibilities in bringing down electricity=20
prices in the state and have not acted with enough force to restrict what=
=20
they perceive as excessive prices for power owned by out-of-state generator=
s.=20
This position gained momentum last week when the California ISO reported th=
at=20
electricity wholesalers overcharged state utilities by $5.5 billion over th=
e=20
past 10 months. Consumer groups also continue to oppose any sort of a=20
bail-out for PGOand SCE and believe that the utilities have hidden money=20
under the protection of other subsidiaries within their parent companies.=
=20
Both utilities maintain that any financial restructuring activities they ha=
ve=20
implemented have been legal. =20

Moreover, while the rate increases may help the state to continue securing=
=20
power on behalf of the utilities, other fundamental problems related to the=
=20
state's energy crisis remain unresolved. The CPUC has asserted that part of=
=20
the benefit of the rate increases is to keep the utilities financially=20
solvent. However, at the same time, the commission clearly states that none=
=20
of the extra revenue generated by the rate hikes can be used to pay down th=
e=20
utilities' outstanding debt. Consequently, although the higher rates should=
=20
significantly increase revenues for both utilities ($2.3 billion a year for=
=20
SCE and $2.5 billion a year for PG&E), all of this money apparently will be=
=20
turned over to the state and do little to alleviate the utilities' own=20
financial problems. This issue still remains unresolved and under the domai=
n=20
of the state legislature. However, the likelihood that PGOand SCE would nee=
d=20
to declare bankruptcy remains strong (unless additional rate increases or=
=20
securitization takes place). In addition, other fundamental problems such a=
s=20
the supply / demand imbalance in California and the related volatility of t=
he=20
state's wholesale market continue to wreak havoc on the market's=20
stakeholders. While the CPUC's rate increases may be a positive step toward=
=20
stabilizing the state's financial, the future remains quite uncertain for=
=20
PGOand SCE.=20
