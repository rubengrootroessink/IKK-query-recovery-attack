Jon Wright (and service list)

At clarification we discussed a possible errata to clarify the last line of  
BPA 68 page 2 Section F.1. A.

The sentence reads:  "The LB CRAC does apply to Slice purchases and the 1,000 
aMW power sale portion of the REP Settlement, including where power sales are 
converted to financial benefits under the Settlement."

the proposed correction is revise the final phrase of the sentence to read:  
"..., including where such power sales are converted cash payments calculated 
pursuant to Section %(b) of the REP Settlement Agreement."

Section 5(b) references conversion of power sales to cash at the mid-C index 
under certain situations. This is the circumstance when the delta should be 
calculated off the "CRAC'd" RL rate.

The language change would make clear that the LB CRAC does not apply to a 
company that chooses to convert a firm power sale to all  Monetary benefits 
under Section 4(1)(b) of the REP Settlement Agreement.  In that event, the  
share of the 1000 MW of power turned down by the IOU  taking all financial 
benefits is reallocated to the other IOUs in the same jurisdiction and the 
companies receiving the power pay the LB CRAC for that power.
The Company taking financial benefits receives benefits calculated using the 
38 mills.

Jon-- after you have had an opportunity to review this proposed errata and 
the Settlement Agreement, please let me know whether BPA will file an errata.

Others:  If you have questions, please feel free to call or email Scott 
Brattebo or me.
