Mary,

No I did not receive it but I am not surprised since I did not receive other 
emails.  The solutions team had been in the process of reinstalling my 
applications to a another laptop and somehow my emails were affected.  Please 
forward it to me again.

Thank you so much,

Nancy

Dear Mary,

I spoke to you last week with regards to a sample wheeling agreement our team 
needed.  Please let me know if you need me to supply any information.  I look 
forward to hearing from you.

Regards,

Nancy
