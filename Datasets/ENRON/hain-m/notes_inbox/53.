As part of our continuing communication we would like to inform you that a 
memorial scholarship fund has been established in memory of Chad Garren, who 
died during Tropical Storm Allison Friday night. "The Chad Garren Memorial 
Scholarship Fund" will benefit a student at Weatherford High School, 
Weatherford, Texas attending Texas A & M University. Chad was a Global 
Technology intern, working in ETS.  If you are interested in contributing to 
this fund, please send your donations to Community Relations EB1635a. Checks 
can be made payable to "The Chad Garren Memorial Scholarship Fund".  All 
donations will be matched by Enron, and it is not necessary to fill out a 
matching gift form.

Funeral services for Chad have been set for 10:00 am on Wednesday June 13 at 
the First United Methodist Church (301 South Main St.) in Weatherford, 
Texas.
