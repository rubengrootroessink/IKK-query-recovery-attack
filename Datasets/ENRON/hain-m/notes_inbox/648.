I'm not on the water but close... we have a community easement.  Where is 
your place?

It would be my house and I listed it on Saturday.  Is your place on the water 
or are you looking for one?

Would that be your home?  I actually found one and don't want to move... but 
the right place at the right price might cause me to.

Are you still looking for a home in Lake Oswego?  One on the water?  I know 
one that will be going on the market.
