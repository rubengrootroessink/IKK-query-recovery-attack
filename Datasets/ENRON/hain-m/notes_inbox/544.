FYI.  I think that the press on Gov. Davis is a bit misleading.

Vicki and Mike--

It is true that the CEC "awarded" us a contract for $1.5MM of grants under 
the AB970 program.  I use quotes around the award because we had responded 
only to an RFQ, not an RFP, so the issuance of the "award" based only on an 
RFQ was unusual (perhaps due to urgency of program).  As the RFQ didn't 
include any terms and conditions, after the "award", we started negotiating 
the terms and conditions of the contract.  We have been hung up on 
consequential damages and indemnities, so on March 12 I prepared a mini-TAF 
covering these issues for executive approval.  George Hernandez' assistant 
picked up the mini-TAF on March 13.  I haven't seen it since and so I don't 
know whether the mini-TAF was fully signed or not.  George is out of the 
office and I have just left his assistant a message.  I am hopeful that no 
one has signed the actual contract pending approval of the mini-TAF.

If I can track down the status of the mini-TAF I'll re-send an email with 
status.

> Governor Gray Davis today announced that the California Energy Commission
> has signed 12 grants and contracts totaling almost $9.2 million to install
> "energy smart" technology in commercial and industrial buildings
> throughout the state.
> 
> "Our campaign for conservation and improved energy efficiency will
> translate into real reductions in the summer when we need it most - and
> beyond," Governor Davis said. "With these grants in place, California will
> continue to set the national standard for energy efficiency."
> 
> The agreements signed by Governor Davis will account for about 93
> megawatts of projected savings from buildings outfitted with demand
> responsive building systems technology. Demand responsive building systems
> work by using software that automatically dim lights, reduce air
> conditioning use, and cut other electrical loads. They operate in response
> to signals from the Independent System Operator (ISO) or from an electric
> utility or service provider.
> 
> Under the agreements, commercial electricity customers will agree to shave
> peak loads by 10 to 30 percent upon receiving the signal from the ISO.
> They will be paid by the ISO to curtail electricity load in their
> buildings in real time.
> 
> In addition to these grants, the Governor also announced that an
> additional eight megawatts of electricity would be saved through grants to
> the K-Mart Corporation. K-Mart will use a $2 million grant to replace old
> lighting fixtures with energy efficient ones in its 85 California stores.
> 
> The demand responsive program and the innovative efficiency and renewables
> program covering the K-Mart grant are parts of AB 970, which was passed
> last year. The bill is designed to reduce at least 220 megawatts of peak
> load by June 1, 2001. 
> 
> The Governor has proposed an additional $70 million in his New Demand
> Reduction Initiative program that would yield an additional 160 megawatts
> in savings from demand responsive building systems. 
> 
> For more information, please contact the California Energy Commission.
> 
> Demand Responsive Contracts:
> 1. Sacramento Municipal Utility District, $882,750, target savings: 10
> megawatts
> 2. Roseville Electric, $956,000, target savings: 10 megawatts 
> 3. Pacific Gas and Electric, $1,411,026, target savings: 35 megawatts
> 4. Seiben Energy Associates, $340,245, target savings: 1.3 megawatts
> 5. Apogee Interactive, Inc., $422,915, target savings: 5 megawatts
> 6. Enron Energy Services Op. Inc. , $1,500,000, target savings: 7.5
> megawatts
> 7. San Diego Regional Energy Office, $1,085,476, target savings: 3.125
> megawatts
> 8. Global Energy Partner, LLC, $1,540,000, target savings: 15 megawatts
> 
> Grants:
> 1. Cisco Systems, $40,460, target savings: 1.2 megawatts
> 2. Alameda County, $260,964, target savings: 1.2 megawatts
> 3. Hewlett Packard, $445,693, target savings: 1.8 megawatts
