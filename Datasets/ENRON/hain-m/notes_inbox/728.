Joe, Christi, & Mary --

Do you think that it makes sense for the four of us to sit down with this 
report the day after it comes out and discuss (1) Enron's perspective, (2) 
should/are we participating, and (3) key commercial / regulatory that need 
the information?

I am trying to make sure that everything is covered appropriately and maybe 
this is the right format - unless you guys can think of something else?

Jim
