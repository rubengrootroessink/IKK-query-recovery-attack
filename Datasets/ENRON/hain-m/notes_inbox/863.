Les:
  As you can imagine today was very busy and I apologize that I was unable
to return your messages until now.  The California ISO would like to thank
you for your bids from the Las Vegas Cogen and the Harbor Cogen, but as we
discussed last night, the ISO will not be accepting these bids.  Again,
thank you for your quick response and we hope that the new market structure
will allow you to participate through the markets.
