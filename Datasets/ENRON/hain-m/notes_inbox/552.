Dissension at FERC:=20
Commission Divided On Price Caps, Future Leadership

by Will McNamara=20
Director, Electric Industry Analysis

[News item from Reuters, March 20] The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission=
=20
(FERC) said it remained divided on whether it should impose a temporary cap=
=20
on wholesale prices in the western United States to prevent summer blackout=
s=20
and price spikes. The three FERC commissioners, who regulate interstate=20
electricity markets, testified at a House of Representatives Energy and Air=
=20
Quality subcommittee hearing as California braced for another day of=20
blackouts.=20

Analysis: Since the start of deregulation in the early 1990s, FERC's variou=
s=20
positions on how competition should unfold across the country have been=20
fairly consistent. Despite its changing members, as a whole the five-member=
=20
commission (with two positions currently open) has taken a "hands-off"=20
approach to its regulatory role, preferring instead to allow free market=20
forces to drive competition in the energy industry. In fact, Curt H,bert,=
=20
appointed as FERC chairman in January by President Bush, told me in an=20
interview during his tenure as a commissioner that he envisioned a time whe=
n=20
FERC would step out of its regulatory role altogether. However, significant=
=20
structural and philosophical changes within the FERC have surfaced since=20
January, dovetailing with the departure of former chairman James Hoecker. A=
s=20
the federal regulatory body for the energy industry, FERC has the=20
responsibility for setting price caps in all regions across the country. Th=
e=20
debate over whether or not to take this controversial step seems to have=20
exposed some inherent dissension within FERC at the very time when the futu=
re=20
leadership of the commission has been cast in doubt. =20

At the House of Representatives meeting on March 20, H,bert, a Republican,=
=20
reiterated his objections to price caps. Chairman H,bert has maintained his=
=20
long-standing opinion that wholesale price caps have done and can do=20
"long-term damage." In January, H,bert told me, "I have seen no evidence th=
at=20
price caps will have any positive impact in creating a balanced market."=20
Although still generally opposed to wholesale price caps on a federal or=20
regional level, H,bert is willing to consider them as one possibility among=
=20
other short-term resolutions to the ongoing market problems in California.=
=20
Reuters reported that H,bert said at the hearings that "such controls are n=
ot=20
a long-term solution and would discourage the industry from building more=
=20
power plants to supply the West." Rather, H,bert believes that power=20
generators need the financial incentive to build new power plants, both in=
=20
California and elsewhere. H,bert was quoted at the subcommittee hearings as=
=20
saying, "Market prices will increase supply and reduce demand, thus=20
correcting the current imbalance. Capping prices through regulation or=20
legislation will have exactly the opposite effect."=20

Despite H,bert's opposition to wholesale price caps, fellow Commissioner=20
William Massey, a Democrat, asserted that California and the western region=
=20
were in such a state of disrepair that a temporary "time out" or price cap=
=20
was needed to let the market stabilize. "The commission must act forcefully=
=20
and decisively to reassure market participants, policymakers and consumers=
=20
that jurisdictional wholesale markets will produce consumer benefits and ju=
st=20
and reasonable rates," Massey said. In addition, Massey reportedly also sai=
d=20
that "such a price cap could be calculated on a generator-by-generator basi=
s=20
at each generator's variable operating cost, plus a reasonable capacity=20
adder, perhaps in the range of $25 per megawatt hour." Massey reiterated th=
e=20
severity of the crisis in California, noting that whereas wholesale power i=
n=20
the state cost $7 billion in 1999 it increased to $27 billion in 2000 and=
=20
could exceed $70 billion for 2001. =20

Rounding out the commission's divided opinion was Commissioner Linda Key=20
Breathitt, a Democrat, who said that all possible options should be analyze=
d=20
and debated. Breathitt did not specifically mention any preference for pric=
e=20
controls.=20

Chairman H,bert's stand against price caps is shared by Energy Secretary=20
Spencer Abraham and seemingly the entire Bush administration. In fact,=20
Abraham said that price caps on wholesale energy will "discourage investmen=
t=20
in new generation at a time when it is most needed" and drive power produce=
rs=20
to other regions of the country (and further away from California). The=20
Energy Secretary reportedly issued an even stronger statement against price=
=20
caps during a Senate hearing on the electricity crisis in California. "The=
=20
only action the administration will not take is the implementation of price=
=20
caps," Abraham said. =20

Another House of Representatives Energy and Air Quality subcommittee hearin=
g=20
is scheduled for later this week. Subcommittee Chairman Joe Barton, a Texas=
=20
Republican, noted that the subcommittee will work toward deciding whether o=
r=20
not legislation regarding wholesale price caps should be developed over the=
=20
next few weeks. =20

This is not the first time that clear schisms have become visible within FE=
RC=20
over major issues facing the energy industry. The commission also became=20
divided regarding the scope of regulation regarding regional transmission=
=20
organizations (RTOs). FERC's December 1999 vote on the Alliance RTO=20
illustrated dissension within the commission and the divergent philosophies=
=20
that the FERC commissioners hold regarding how the industry should be=20
regulated. Then-Commissioner H,bert was of the opinion that the Alliance RT=
O=20
met FERC guidelines for RTO formation, and was the sole member who=20
successfully pushed for voluntary rather than mandatory participation in an=
=20
RTO. However, H,bert stood as a minority. The other three commissioners at=
=20
FERC at the time (Hoecker, Massey and Breathitt) preferred to wield a tight=
er=20
regulatory hand and monitor how transmission owners comply with current=20
transmission policy. While H,bert supports the ownership of RTOs by utiliti=
es=20
and letting free market principles rule, the other commissioners at FERC=20
appeared to support only passive ownership of RTOs by utilities.=20

Meanwhile, speculation continues that President Bush will soon appoint Pat=
=20
Wood III, chairman of the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT), to the=
=20
position of FERC chairman. H,bert was named chairman in February by Preside=
nt=20
Bush after James Hoecker resigned shortly before the new Republican=20
administration took office Jan. 20. At that time, the president did not=20
indicate that H,bert's appointment as chair was temporary. Wood was appoint=
ed=20
by then Texas Governor Bush to the PUCT in 1995 and played a primary role i=
n=20
the development of that state's restructuring plan. (Electric choice begins=
=20
in Texas on June 1, 2001, with the start of a pilot program and then the=20
market opens fully to competition on Jan. 1, 2002). =20

The possible shift in leadership at FERC appears to be politically motivate=
d.=20
There are two "Republican" openings to be filled at FERC by President Bush.=
=20
As noted, presently H,bert is the only Republican among the current three=
=20
members. Wood, reportedly a close ally and advisor to the former Texas=20
governor, has been repeatedly named as a strong candidate for one of the=20
Republican openings on FERC for some time. However, the Washington Post and=
=20
Reuters have reported that Wood will be appointed as FERC chairman, forcing=
=20
H,bert to step back into a role as commissioner. The report in Reuters=20
indicated that H,bert, a friend and prot,g, of Senate Majority Leader Trent=
=20
Lott (R-Miss.), is personally "fighting the planned move." The nomination=
=20
would require Senate confirmation.=20

Moreover, as political drivers continue to impact the structure of FERC, th=
e=20
issue of price caps remains unresolved. The debate over price caps also has=
=20
divided others involved, strictly along party lines. Generally speaking,=20
Democrats believe that the federal government should step in to prevent wha=
t=20
has been called "price gouging" on the part of  energy companies. Republica=
ns=20
believe that the government (including FERC and the Bush administration)=20
should maintain a "hands-off" approach and allow the marketplace to determi=
ne=20
prices. Speaking from a non-partisan point of view, some economists now=20
question whether=01*and not just how=01*deregulation of electricity markets=
 should=20
occur at all. For instance, Alfred E. Kahn, the Cornell University economis=
t=20
who helped deregulate other industries, says that electricity markets may n=
ot=20
lend themselves to full competition and that there may be a value in=20
retaining vertical integration among utilities (allowing a single regulated=
=20
power company to produce, transmit and distribute electricity). The movemen=
t=20
toward re-regulation certainly throws an additional wrinkle into the debate=
=20
over wholesale price caps. =20

Yet, in any event, once again California remains the catalyst for=20
decision-making on this issue. As rolling blackouts threaten to continue in=
to=20
a third day in the state, federal lawmakers may be pressured to issue a=20
definitive position on wholesale price caps for California, which of course=
=20
would set a precedent for the rest of the country. As the industry's top=20
agency in charge of wholesale markets, FERC's ultimate position on price ca=
ps=20
carries tremendous influence. Despite the apparent dissension within the=20
commission and possible changes in its leadership, FERC is presently=20
challenged to formulate a solid policy on how wholesale transactions will b=
e=20
conducted, or once and for all absolve itself from jurisdiction in this=20
area. =20
