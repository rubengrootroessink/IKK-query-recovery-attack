				"For  anyone having had the pleasure of researching Order No. 888  
tariff-related issues -- and what energy attorney or rate analyst  hasn't had 
that 'pleasure?' -- Allen's 888  Annotated is a welcome addition to the 
energy library.? My  copy is already dog-eared."? (Electric Co-op Today

interpret OATTs  adopted by the nation's jurisdictional and 
non-jurisdictional electric  utilities.
