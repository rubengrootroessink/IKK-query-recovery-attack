FROM: Jana Martin, Public Affairs Committee Chair

RE: Conference Call on Customer Choice Outreach

Several members have requested that EPSA provide a forum for ongoing dialogue 
regarding a communications/advocacy strategy in support of EPSA's principal 
messages regarding the value of retail electricity competition and customer 
choice.

If this is an area of interest to you or your company, we would encourage you 
to join us for the first of these discussions on Friday, March 23, at 11 a.m. 
EST.  To access the call, dial 1-800-937-6563 and ask for the Samantha 
Slater/EPSA call.

Representatives from Public Strategies Inc. will be available to assist the 
group with a discussion of potential options and resource requirements.  
Other interested retail providers may also be invited to participate.

A specific agenda will be distributed in advance of the call, but if you have 
any questions in the meantime, please don't hesitate to contact Samantha 
Slater or Mark Stultz at 202-628-8200.
