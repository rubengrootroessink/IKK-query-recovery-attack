FPC, FPL and TECO filed a lengthy response to all the protests of its amended 
filing.  Recall that EPMI filed a protest asking GridFlorida to implement a 
real time energy market and remove the day ahead balanced schedule 
requirement.   Dan Staines and Mike Roan are doing a good job because rather 
than replying that the real time energy market is a bad idea, the GridFlorida 
utilities responded that they are not necessarily opposed as a theoretical 
matter, there were some practical considerations that led them not to include 
such a market in their proposal, including "(1) concerns that unbalanced 
schedules will not work without either some form of forward market or a 
centralized unit commitment process; (2) concerns that GridFlorida be able to 
demonstrate the ability to administer a market with balanced schedules before 
considering unbalanced schedules; and (3) concerns about the impact of market 
power in the region on the larger real-time energy market that would result 
from unbalanced schedules."  Grid Florida then stresses that the decision to 
require balanced schedules is not necessarily meant to be permanent and the 
ability to submit unbalanced schedules, if not raised sooner, would be an 
issue for further consideration in the report on market design due within 18 
months after commencement and that GridFlorida has complete freedom to 
propose changes to its tariff, which it could do at anytime (through the 
Advisory Committee.)
