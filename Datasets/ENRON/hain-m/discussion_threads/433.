Currently, (for the East) Thane takes the summaries of Northeast 
orders/filings and sends them to the traders/originators/reg folks, etc.  I 
look at the rest of the East info and send it/take it to the appropriate 
trader/originator/developer/reg person (EPMI and EES).  I also alert someone 
in our group if I think that we need to intervene/protest/participate.  

What I will start doing to make sure the loop is complete is to email the 
report to Joe, Mary, Jim, Rick and Sarah with my comments on what I have done 
(for example, alerted traders/developers to issues, alerted state reg. people 
to retail filings, etc.) and whether I think EPMI or EES need to get involved 
in any of the cases.

Thanks. C.

Joe, Christi, & Mary --

Do you think that it makes sense for the four of us to sit down with this 
report the day after it comes out and discuss (1) Enron's perspective, (2) 
should/are we participating, and (3) key commercial / regulatory that need 
the information?

I am trying to make sure that everything is covered appropriately and maybe 
this is the right format - unless you guys can think of something else?

Jim
