Subject: Talk to Joe Sutton on eSpeak Today!

Log on to ethink.enron.com on Friday, November 19 at 9:30 a.m. (Houston time) 
and talk to Joe Sutton on Enron's first eSpeak event!

What is eSpeak?

eSpeak is an interactive Q&A forum on the eThink intranet site where we will 
be holding scheduled events with a variety of people on a variety of 
subjects.  Joe Sutton is our first guest speaker.

For one hour, you have an opportunity to ask Joe how Enron can break down 
communication barriers.  Share your ideas with him for innovative ways to 
communicate and tell him how you want to receive information.  Also, what can 
Joe personally do to encourage better communication across business units, 
within teams and with your co-workers?
