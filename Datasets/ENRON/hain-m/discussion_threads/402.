Subject:  Happy Birthday


Happy Birthday Mary!  I hope you and Pete and Bosco and doing well!  I'm
doing fine.  As you probably are aware, we are very busy in Rates these
days with all the energy prices going up and California having rolling
blackouts.  They  also are pushing to take care of all the backlog.
Fortunately for me, most of the backlog is in Electric Rates and I am doing
only a few electric cases.  Things seem to have settled down with my
family.

Have a wonderful celebration however you celebrate,

Sandra
