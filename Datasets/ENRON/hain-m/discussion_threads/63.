?
Attached is a copy of the data request for FERC's Bulk Power  Investigation.? 
Please consider this e-mail as our official data  request.
?
As far as the deadline, we'd like to have the information as soon as  
possible but we realize that doesn't give you much time.? As I mentioned,  
some of the information probably won't require much effort, but we are 
asking  for?specifics on generators which may take longer.? Just do the best  
you can.? Also, if you find that you have the information in a different  
format from the way we've requested it, that will probably be fine for our  
purposes.
?
Please feel free to call if you have any  questions.
?
Thanks.
?
