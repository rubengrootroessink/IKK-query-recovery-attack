ECS to ECN Network Interconnection July 14, 2001

This is a notification that the Enron Corp. I/T Networks team will be 
connecting the new building network infrastructure located in Enron Center 
South (ECS) to the existing Enron Center North (ECN) backbone network.  While 
this activity is not expected to produce a disruption to network services, 
this notice is designed to alert the organization to our activities.  No 
network hardware or systems are anticipated to be shutdown.  The actual 
physical interconnection of the networks will be performed in the EB 34th 
floor Data Center.

Interconnection activities are scheduled to occur the evening of July 14, 
2001 starting from 7:00 p.m.(CT) and completing around 11:00 p.m. (CT). 
Application testing activities will begin at 11:00 p.m. (CT) once all network 
testing has completed.

If you have any further questions, please contact Pete Castrejana at 
713-410-0642 for more information.
