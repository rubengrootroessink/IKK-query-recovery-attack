Hello, members of the RTO West Stage 2 Tariff Integration  Group.
?
Attached for your entertainment and other use is the RTO  West Tariff 
"working document" as we put it together today at the Tariff  Integration 
Group meeting (just the sections relating to Part I - General  Service 
Provisions).? The only thing?I added after the meeting was pro  forma tariff 
language on load shedding and curtailment?(because I didn't  want to take the 
time to incorporate such a long provision during the  meeting).
?
I am sending this out now in case you want to review it,  but next week I 
will send out a more fully developed working document with other  materials 
incorporated, as well as an updated "work tracking  document."
?
Please remember that our next meeting will be on  Wednesday, April 4 from 
7:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. at the RTO West  office.
?
We have also scheduled a conference call just to talk  about ADR for Friday, 
March 30 from 9:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Pacific Time.?  I will send an e-mail 
with call-in arrangements after I have made  them.
?
Thank you very much!
