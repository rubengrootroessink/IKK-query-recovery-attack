Linda--Can you find out how much it would cost for the live web cast if we 
wanted to listen in from Houston/Portland?

Electricity Markets:  How Do They Work?

EEI's Energy Delivery Group presents a series of four workshops on the basics 
of electricity market design. Attend in person in Washington DC or in your 
office via live Webcast!

Mark Your Calendars!
April 26, May 18, May 24, and June 14
Hyatt Regency Washington, DC on Capitol Hill

How electricity markets work is vitally important, as California's 
well-publicized restructuring experience vividly demonstrates.  Many regions 
have made great progress in developing these markets to bring customers 
choice, lower cost power and new energy products.  Others are working to 
develop the institutions, regional transmission organizations (or RTOs), and 
the markets needed to support electric competition.

EEI is now offering a four workshop series on the basics of electricity 
market design. These workshops are specifically designed for policymakers and 
analysts developing restructuring policy who would benefit from a better 
understanding of market design basics.

The workshops will focus on the key questions and topics that define how 
markets are designed, evaluate alternative market structures and clarify 
where the industry is headed.  Attendees will benefit from the knowledge and 
expertise of nationally renowned experts dedicated to making complex issues 
understandable.
