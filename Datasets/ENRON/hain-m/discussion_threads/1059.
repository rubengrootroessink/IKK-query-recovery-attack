Hello, Everyone -

This Notice (sent to you by blind copy to save trees) confirms our Regional
Representatives Group (RRG) meeting for this coming Friday, May 4, at the
Sheraton Portland Airport Hotel in Mt. Hood Room C.  Unfortunately, we
weren't able to reserve two Mt. Hood rooms, so it may be a little cramped.
The meeting will start at 8:30 a.m. and end by 12:00 p.m.

As most of you know by now, FERC issued its order on RTO West last Thursday,
October 26.  In case you have not located the order, you can find it by
clicking on the following RTO West website address that will take you to the
order. At the RTO West web page, click on "Link to Documents Submitted to
FERC..." and at the next page click on "FERC Order issued April 26, 2001 in
RTO West...."

www.rtowest.org

The first part of the meeting will be devoted to a discussion of the order
and answering questions.  Mike Coleman from FERC will attend the meeting and
will be pleased to provide his understanding of the meaning of various parts
of the order.

Our working agenda is:

1. Discussion of FERC Order on RTO West

2. Congestion Management Model - Description of Alternatives

3. Stage 2 FERC filing schedule

4. Interregional Coordination

We look forward to seeing you all this Friday.

Warm regards,

- Bud
