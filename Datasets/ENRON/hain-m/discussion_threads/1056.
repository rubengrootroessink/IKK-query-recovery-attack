The American Gas Association Legal Forum Program Planning Committee invites
you to attend the Twenty-Fourth Annual Legal Forum. The Forum will be held
this year from Sunday evening, July 15, through Tuesday evening, July 17, at
The Hyatt Regency Monterey in Monterey, California.

The AGA Legal Forum is regarded as one of the preeminent legal programs for
attorneys in the natural gas industry. It is an intensive two-day seminar
that gives participants the opportunity for in-depth discussion of gas
industry issues with other member company general counsel and senior
attorneys in this outstanding program. This twenty-fourth annual Legal Forum
will focus on the impact of the dramatic changes taking place in the
industry and the new legal challenges facing you and your clients.

The Hyatt Regency Monterey is located directly adjacent to the championship
Del Monte Golf Course, and just a few blocks from the Pacific Ocean and
Monterey Bay. Within minutes is direct access to Cannery Row, Fisherman's
Wharf, Monterey Bay Aquarium, Carmel and Pebble Beach. The Hyatt is 5
minutes from Monterey Airport (with direct or connecting service from
American, America West and United Airlines) or 90 minutes from San Jose
Airport.
