Dear Ms. Hain,

Energy Restructuring in the Southwest conference, co-sponsored by Energy
Newsdata Corporation

When/Where: July 19 and 20, 2001 at the Alexis Park in Las Vegas

While California=01,s electric system stumbles from crisis to crisis during=
 a
continuing state of emergency, states and municipalities throughout the
Western region are reexamining and, in some cases, reversing their policies
regarding restructuring of the electric services industry. This has
resulted in ever-changing and confusing laws and policies affecting
utilities, energy service providers and consumers in Arizona, Nevada and
New Mexico.

This conference will help lay the groundwork for a better understanding of
current market and regulatory conditions in the Southwest, and the faculty
of expert speakers will provide insight as to how evolving policies will
shape markets of the future.

Program Co-chairs: Arthur O'Donnell of California Energy Markets and Fred
Schmidt of Hale Lane Peek Dennison Howard & Anderson.
