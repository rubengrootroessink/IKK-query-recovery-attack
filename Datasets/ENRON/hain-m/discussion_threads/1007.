 Oregon Law Institute, Northwestern School of Law of Lewis & Clark
College is pleased to present a program on =01&A Primer on Consumer Law=018=
 on
Friday, May 4th at the Oregon Convention Center, in Portland.

 You can still take advantage of our =01&early bird=018 price of $140 or $1=
10
for new attorneys (admitted 2000-2001), paralegals, or secretaries. This
price is good through April 30th.

 By now, you should know that attorneys can be considered debt
collectors subject to the Fair  Debt Collection Practices Act =01) even if
the attorney never sends a letter or makes a telephone call, but simply
files a lawsuit.  Litigation against attorneys under the FDCPA is
increasing nationwide, and attorneys are being held liable for even
innocent and technical violations of the FDCPA.  Attend this program to
learn the top 10 ways attorneys violate the FDCPA, and how they can
avoid the violations.  Learning even one new tip could save you in
damages many times the cost of this CLE!

 The brochure is attached in PDF format. You may also contact the Oregon
Law Institute at 503-243-3326 or 800-222-8213 for a brochure or to
register now at the =01&early bird=018 tuition.
