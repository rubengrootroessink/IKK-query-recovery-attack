 Market Participants:

 Please assure that this information is forwarded to your respective
Pre-Scheduling, Real Time Dispatch and Metering Operations!!!

 The transition to Daylight Savings Time is rapidly approaching.  In
preparation ISO Market Operations has provided the following Scheduling
Procedure to help assure a smooth transition.  The Scheduling Procedure is
the same one used in 2000.

  CAISO Scheduling Procedure for Daylight Savings Time
Transition

  The following is a brief explanation of how SC's should
prepare schedules for submission to the CAISO Scheduling Infrastructure (SI)
system for the upcoming conversion to Daylight Savings Time commencing on
4/1/01.

  When submitting preferred or revised preferred schedules for
Trade Date 4/1/01, which is considered a "Short" day because an hour is
lost, SC's should  schedule all 24 hours of information with the data for
HE03 being zeroed out in the template or blanked out when using the CAISO SI
Web Workspace to submit schedules.

  The ISO's System Applications (SA) do not read or write data
from/to the SI database for the "Short" day's HE03.  Therefore, no data will
be sent to settlements for this hour.  Consequently, settlements will have
only 23 records for this "Short" day, Trade Date 4/1/01.

  If you have additional Scheduling questions for this trade
date, please contact Ginger Seitles, ISO Market Operations, @ (916)351-4420.


  CAISO Metering Procedure for Daylight Savings Time
Transition

  The ISO receives all Settlement Quality Meter Data (SQMD) in
PST, year around.

  Therefore, the transition to DST should require no
modification to meter data submission.

  However, please confirm and assure that all SQMD meter data
continues to be submitted to ISO MDAS in PST.

  If you have additional ISO Metering questions for this trade
date, please contact  ISO MDAS OPERATIONS, @ (916) 351-4431.

 For any other questions please contact your Client Representative.
