Hello, Everyone -

This confirms our Regional Representatives Group (RRG) meeting for next
Wednesday, June 27, at the NEW LOCATION.  We will meet at the Shilo Inn -
Portland Airport, 11701 NW Airport Way, from 8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. (We'll
end sooner if we can.)  The meeting will be held in the Mt. Rainer and Mt.
Hood Rooms, and the reader boards will give directions at the hotel and
convention center entrances.  A continental breakfast will be available at
8:00 a.m.

Also, through Judy Welch's excellent advocacy, the Shilo is holding a block
of rooms for $94/night if you identify yourselves as being there for RTO
West.  The regular price is $109.

This meeting is informational and will focus primarily on the items RTO West
intends to submit to FERC by August 31.  Here's our working agenda:

1.      Update on "illustrative" pricing model

2.      Planning/expansion update

3.      Report on Congestion Management

4.      Report on FERC Interregional Technical Conference on June 19

5.      Benefit Cost update

I look forward to seeing you next Wednesday.

- Bud
