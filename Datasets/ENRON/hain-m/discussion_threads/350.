Mary, Alan and Sue:

Although Enron is not part of either the DSTAR Power Marketer Coalition
or the RTOWest Power Marketer Coaltion, I am passing this on to you so
you will know what I would be advocating in RTOWest.  If you see
something problematic (which I doubt, since the DSTAR market monitoring
approach is pretty much a minimalist approach), let me know, so we can
sort out any possible differences privately.

Thanks,

Carl

Subject: Comments on 022801 Draft of DSTAR Market Monitoring Appendix
Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary="------------551C15E7D09"

Arnold, Bill, Bill and Mike:

Attached are my redline comments on the most-recent draft of the DSTAR
Market Monitoring Appendix (Appendix H).  I view all of the comments to
be clarifications - but nonetheless important and worthy of your serious
consideration - rather than significant, controversial changes to the
draft.

Because you have requested that parties provide position papers by next
week to the DSTAR Board regarding their concerns on Appendix H, I would
appreciate your review of the attached comments with the goal of letting
me know which of the proposed changes are unacceptable.  If there are no
substantive issues, then I would not plan to draft a position paper
laying out concerns to the Board, but would instead simply urge both my
clients and the Board to support the approval of Appendix H.

Thanks for your help.

Carl Imparato

-----------------------------
Note to ccs:  I view the current draft, with the proposed modifications,
as basically acceptable.  It defers a number of important market
monitoring issues until after the filing date, but does not prejudice
the resolution of the issues in one way or another.

AT THIS POINT, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT EACH OF YOUR COMPANIES TAKE A GOOD
LOOK AT THE DOCUMENT TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE CONCERNS THAT
YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE RAISED AT THE NEXT DSTAR BOARD MEETING.

Carl
