Hello, Everyone -

Several important meetings conflict with our tentatively scheduled RRG
meeting on Friday, June 29.  Therefore, we've re-scheduled the next RRG
meeting to Wednesday, June 27, AT A NEW LOCATION.  We will meet at the Shilo
Inn - Portland Airport, 11701 NE Airport Way, from 8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.
I understand shuttle service is available from the airport.

We'll be sending out an agenda and any follow-up information next week.

Have a pleasant weekend.

- Bud
