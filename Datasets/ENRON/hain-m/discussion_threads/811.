Mary,

Best of luck in your new responsibilities.  If you hear of any
opportunities for an economist at NE-ISO, please let me know.  I'm
always interested in what might "lie beyond" (but not "beneath").

Actually, I recently responded to an ad at NE-ISO for an economist to
study market structures, but never heard back from them.  Marcia and
I have family or good friends in NY, New Hampshire, Vermont,
Massachusetts, and Connecticut, and occasionally think that we should
move back, notwithstanding the winters  . . .  and the summers!

Lon
