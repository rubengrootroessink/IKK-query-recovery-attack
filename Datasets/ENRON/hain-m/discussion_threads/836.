Market Participants and Scheduling Coordinators:

The CA ISO has received a number of requests for historic unit specific
outage information, consistent with the outage data that is posted daily on
the CA ISO website.  Because the CA ISO has determined that there are no
legal or policy reasons to treat this information as confidential, the CA
ISO will provide such data in response to the requests (and any subsequent
requests).  Unless there is a change to tariff section 20.3.2, the CA ISO
will NOT make publicly available generator outage programs submitted to the
CA ISO (i.e. information on planned prospective outages).  The CA ISO notes
that the historic information on generator outages that is in the CA ISO's
possession is highly unreliable until beginning of 2001.  While the CA ISO
will provide historic outage information in its possession in response to
properly submitted requests, the CA ISO does not and will not vouch for the
accuracy of data for years 1998, 1999 and 2000.

The CA ISO plans to begin disseminating historic outage data in response to
requests on Friday, March 30.  Any questions or concerns related to this
message should be referred to Jeanne M. Sol, at jsole@caiso.com
<mailto:jsole@caiso.com> ; (916) 608-7144.
