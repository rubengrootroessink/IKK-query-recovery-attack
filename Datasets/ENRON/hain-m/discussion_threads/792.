Hi,

Over the past weeks, I have been staying at home with my new daughter (a
picture is attached, though it does not do her justice).  Monday, March 12,
I intend to return to the office.

My sense is that Paul Mohler has been doing a fine job running the rate
case.  I hope you agree -- if not, please tell me.  I intend to start
reintegrating myself into the RTO West/TransConnect work, and will call to
discuss -- I'm writing now to get you thinking about it.

Stan
