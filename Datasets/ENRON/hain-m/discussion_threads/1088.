Energy Infrastructure Crisis in  the West
June 25-27, 2001, San  Francisco, CA
Presented by: Infocast 


[IMAGE] Concerns  regarding the price and availability of electricity have 
brought an urgent  call from state governments, regulators, utilities and 
consumers  throughout the West: Build more power plants, and build them 
quickly!  However, as natural gas prices scale to new heights and with the 
electric  transmission system contributing to power outages in San Francisco, 
it has  become clear that the problem is more complex, and that plant 
developments  alone won't resolve the power crisis in the west. While it is 
clear that  something must be done, and done quickly, it is not nearly as 
clear what  the right combination of "fixes" is. What is the most 
cost-effective  solution to the energy shortfall?  

This conference, Energy Infrastructure Crisis in  the West, will offer a 
comprehensive view of the shortcomings  of the current energy 
infrastructure--generation, natural gas pipelines  and storage, electric 
transmission-and how these shortcomings might be  addressed through 
development. You will hear from legislators, regulators,  and state officials 
how they are encouraging the development of new energy  infrastructure, and 
from developers and utilities what it will really take  to quickly respond to 
infrastructure needs. Specific issues that will be  addressed include:  

Legislative, utility and consumer views on how to solve the energy  crisis  
Developing new generation--what should be done to expedite the  process?  
Electric transmission bottlenecks--can a solution be quickly found?  
Beefing up the region's natural gas infrastructure--comparing  pipeline and 
storage expansion proposals 

If you are considering  the development of energy assets in western power 
markets, attending this  conference is your best opportunity to learn about 
the prospects for  success. Plus, don't miss our exciting half-day 
pre-conference workshops  "Economic Evaluation of Quick Fixes to Local Power 
Supply Problems" and  "Establishing Demand Response Programs that Work".  

Register by Friday, May 25, 2001 to receive a SPECIAL DISCOUNT and attend for 
only $795.00  for the conference and $200.00 per pre-conference workshop.
