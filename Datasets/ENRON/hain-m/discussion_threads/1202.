The Community Relations department would like to thank employees for their 
tireless assistance last week in the wake of Tropical Storm Allison and let 
you know that there are many more opportunities to help Houstonians. 

To continue to volunteer in the community, call Jennifer Milligan ext. 35272 
or go to home.enron.com/flood <http://home.enron.com/flood> for more 
information.

We also wanted to give you an update on all of the efforts made last week to 
the community and our employees.

DONATIONS FOR THE COMMUNITY
Donations to organizations in the community assisting flood victims will be 
accepted in  EB1635a. These donations will not count toward employee matching 
gift limit.

? Enron was a pacesetter company for the community with its corporate 
contribution of $500,000 to the American Red Cross.

? Employees contributed $27,390 to the Houston Flood Relief drive, bringing 
the total donation to $54,780 with the Enron match.


CONTRIBUTIONS FOR OUR ENRON FAMILY
Donations to the employee relief fund, benefiting those Enron employees 
affected by the flood, will be accepted at the Enron Federal Credit Union. 

Also, donations for the Chad Garren Memorial Scholarship Fund will continue 
to be accepted EB1635a. These donations will not count toward employee

To date, the scholarship fund has raised $13,710 with the Enron match.

priority rental cars.
