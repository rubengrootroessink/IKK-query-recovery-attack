Over the past week, many Enron employees have volunteered their time to help 
with the city-wide flood relief efforts. Thank you! 

There are many agencies that need your help this weekend.  We have included a 
list of agencies that are looking for volunteers over the weekend. If you are 
interested in donating your time and energy, please call the individual 
contact phone number listed for each project.

Thank you for volunteering your time to help the Houston community during 
this time of great need. Please feel free to send this information to other
