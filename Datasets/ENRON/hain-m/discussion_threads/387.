> To Market Participants:
>
> The California ISO is initiating a study to increase the rating of Path 26
> (Midway-Vincent 500 kV lines) from its current rating of 3,000 MW
> (bi-directional).  The path rating increase is being initiated in response
> to concerns over the amount of congestion that has historically been
> experienced on Path 26.
>
> A stakeholder group is being formed to provide input into the studies. In
> addition, a draft Study Plan is attached here for your comments.  Due to
> the expedited nature of the study, please provide your interest in
> participating on the study group and/or comments on the study plan to
> David Le (dle@caiso.com) by March 16, 2001.
