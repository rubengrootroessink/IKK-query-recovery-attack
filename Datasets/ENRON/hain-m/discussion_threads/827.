Register now for EEI's Workshop Series on Electricity Markets:  How Do They 
Work?  The first workshop is April 26th.  So don't delay.

Our unique set of workshops, over four one-day sessions,  present the basics 
of electricity market design in a clear, non-technical format.  The workshops 
are designed specifically for industry policymakers who could benefit from a 
clearer understanding of market design issues.

The four workshops are:
?    April 26 - Basic Economics of Electricity Markets That I Need to Know
?    May 18 - The Basics of Electricity Market Design and How to Implement It
?    May 24 - Transmission Pricing and Management
?    June 14 - Market Monitoring and Market Power

You can attend each workshop in person in Washington DC or in your office via 
live Webcast!  You will receive a CD ROM set of the workshop presentations, 
complete with digital video and slide presentations, after the series.
