That's really nice of you Mary.  I'd like to return the favor some time.  I'm
having a medical procedure Friday afternoon that I'd just as soon not describe
- except to say I might not be in too good a shape Friday evening.  Will you
guys be back in town after your trip East long enough to spend an evening with
you?  If not, let's at least do lunch some day next week - I have Tuesday thru
Thur open - and would love to have Pete join us - my treat.  dn

We're flying back East on Sunday.  You are invited to come over Friday
evening, if you like.  Some of our other friends have asked to get together so
we're inviting people for pot luck.  we'll supply the beer.  Feel free to
bring your mom too. Or we could do something else, before Sunday.

You're welcome.  I talked to Janet last night - would you and Pete be able to
make dinner at our house next weekend - perhaps Sunday night?  dn

Thanks for sharing.  She's just adorable!

Hi,

Over the past weeks, I have been staying at home with my new daughter (a
picture is attached, though it does not do her justice).  Monday, March 12,
I intend to return to the office.

My sense is that Paul Mohler has been doing a fine job running the rate
case.  I hope you agree -- if not, please tell me.  I intend to start
reintegrating myself into the RTO West/TransConnect work, and will call to
discuss -- I'm writing now to get you thinking about it.

Stan
