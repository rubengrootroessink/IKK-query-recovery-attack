Enron Stock Drops Amid Concerns About Broadband Business,=20
General Market Trends

by Will McNamara=20
Director, Electric Industry Analysis

[News item from Reuters] Shares of electricity and natural-gas marketing=20
giant Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE) slid further on Thursday (March 22) amid=20
broader weakness in energy stocks, despite a reassurance from the company=
=20
that it would hit its previously stated target earnings for this year. Enro=
n=20
was off $3.34, or 6 percent, at $52.55 on March 22, after falling 8 percent=
=20
on March 21. So far this year, Enron's stock is down about 37 percent, vers=
us=20
a 16-percent decline for Standard & Poor's utilities index and a 20-percent=
=20
drop for the Dow Jones industrial average.=20

Analysis: Over the last several weeks, a growing number of smaller, emergin=
g=20
energy companies have felt the impact from the nation's struggling economy=
=20
and the likelihood of an impending recession. Just recently, start-up=20
companies such as Silicon Energy and Hydrogen Burner Technology have=20
withdrawn their IPO plans, citing an anemic stock market and the lack of=20
positive cash flow. A look across the stock market can send shivers down th=
e=20
spines of most energy company CEOs, as the Dow Jones industrial average=20
tumbled below the 9,200 point for the first time in two years, and the Nasd=
aq=20
composite remains 64 percent off of its March 10, 2000, high of 5,048,=20
putting the economy in bear market territory. =20

However, while the stocks and public offerings of smaller energy companies=
=20
may crash and burn, the giant energy company that is Enron Corp. typically=
=20
has seemed immune from the high and low tides of the U.S. economy. Over the=
=20
course of 2000, Enron shares returned 89 percent and traded at roughly 55=
=20
times trailing earnings, reportedly more than 2.5 times the multiple of its=
=20
some of its main competitors or the S=02?500. Nevertheless, Enron's winning=
=20
streak in the stock market may be eroding, as the waves that are crashing=
=20
around many other energy companies may also be dragging Enron into the same=
=20
whirlpool.=20

For perspective, Enron's closest competitors across its various business=20
lines, Williams and Dynegy, also appear to be taking the hit from the bear=
=20
market. Williams (NYSE: WMB) saw its stock decline $3.34, or 8 percent, to=
=20
$38.10 on March 22. Dynegy (NYSE: DYN) saw its stock drop $2.26, or 5=20
percent, to $44.50. Of course, of the three companies, Enron wields the=20
highest P/E ratio at 49.99 and largest market capitalization at $41.7=20
billion. By comparison, Williams has a P/E ratio of 21.53 and market=20
capitalization of $20 billion, while Dynegy has a P/E ratio of 31.98 and=20
market capitalization of $15.2 billion.=20

Analysts that keep a close eye on Enron's stock say the sudden decline is n=
ot=20
a reflection of any new business developments at the company, but rather a=
=20
market that is struggling in general, and a growing disenchantment among=20
investors in technology and telecommunications in particular. This may be=
=20
having a unique impact on Enron as the company attributed much of its stron=
g=20
stock performance over the last year to its growing expansion into the=20
telecommunications / broadband market. Just as the company has achieved=20
unparalleled success in electricity and natural-gas trading, for the last=
=20
year Enron has been developing a high-speed broadband communications networ=
k=20
to support its planned move into bandwidth trading and marketing. Enron=20
projects a $450 billion worldwide market for communications bandwidth tradi=
ng=20
and services by 2005, and the valuation of its own broadband business at $4=
0=20
a share, or $35 billion. The company plans to trade excess bandwidth=20
capacity, and in order to do so is constructing its own network, which cost=
s=20
a lot of money. Enron has acknowledged that it intends to sell between $2=
=20
billion and $4 billion in assets over the next 12 months in order to reduce=
=20
debt and support the new business in broadband (among other businesses in=
=20
pulp and paper, data storage and advertising).=20

Thus, much is riding on the anticipated success of the broadband business,=
=20
and Enron's role in it. Up to this point, confidence in both the industry a=
nd=20
the company have run high. Some analysts have reported that interest in=20
Enron's expansion into this area, validated by investor interest in new=20
technologies in general, drove an 87-percent rise in the company's share=20
price last year. Yet, once again, the tide may be turning. Investors no=20
longer seem to be as enthralled by emerging technologies that have not=20
resulted in bottom-line profits, much as the year before e-commerce stocks=
=20
also found that their "day in the sun" ended rather abruptly. =20

And, although nearly every other Enron line of business has turned to gold,=
=20
its broadband business has remained immature. In fact, for year-end 2000,=
=20
Enron Broadband Services reported a $60 million IBIT loss, reflecting start=
up=20
costs to build the new business. The company seems to have anticipated the=
=20
slow growth of its broadband business. In fact, Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling=
=20
did not appear concerned over the loss and said that it took between five a=
nd=20
six years for the company's natural-gas business to develop standardized=20
contracts and increase liquidity. Skilling has said that these numbers do n=
ot=20
dilute his belief that bandwidth trading will soon become a strong performe=
r=20
for the company. While Skilling remains optimistic about the potential of t=
he=20
broadband business, investors may not be as patient. (Note that while Enron=
's=20
broadband business took a loss for 2000, the company as a whole reported a=
=20
25-percent increase in earnings per diluted share to $1.47 and a 32-percent=
=20
increase in net income to $1.3 billion).=20

In late January Enron had increased its earnings target for 2001 to between=
=20
$1.70 and $1.75 per share. In response to the sudden drop in stock price an=
d=20
speculation that its broadband business would receive new pressure to becom=
e=20
profitable, Enron issued a brief statement reiterating that it "remains ver=
y=20
comfortable" with the 2001 earnings estimate. An Enron spokesperson also ma=
de=20
references to "information in the market that is inaccurate," suggesting th=
at=20
any speculation about problems in its broadband business were unfounded,=20
including potential layoffs at the broadband unit. According to a report on=
=20
CBS.MarketWatch.com, investors polled by First Call / Thompson Financial ar=
e=20
still expecting Enron to turn in earnings in a range of $1.67 to $1.80 for=
=20
2001.=20

Nevertheless, despite Enron's reassurances that it remains on track to meet=
=20
its earnings estimate, the company's stock continued to drop. As noted,=20
investors began to put downward pressure on the stock, pushing it to $52.50=
=20
(as of March 22), below its 52-week low of $55 and far below its 52-week hi=
gh=20
of $90.56. =20

Some of the decline may be attributed to the fact that many investors remai=
n=20
unclear about what it is that Enron does, exactly. According to a March 5=
=20
article in Fortune magazine entitled "Is Enron Overpriced?", some Wall=20
Streeters are skeptical about how the company makes its money, and the lack=
=20
of clarity has often raised a red flag about Enron's pricey stock. The=20
skepticism did not seem to steal any of Enron's thunder in a bull market, b=
ut=20
that could all change quickly in a bear market. Enron may in fact exacerbat=
e=20
Wall Street's distrust in its business model by not fully disclosing its=20
financial records for what it deems "competitive reasons." The Fortune=20
report, which was published before Enron's stock began to decline, also=20
indicated that investors are concerned about Enron's debt. Although the=20
company continues to promise a reduction in its debt load, Enron carried a=
=20
net $13 billion debt at the end of September 2000. Again, although investor=
s=20
may have been able to look the other way from Enron's debt during a strong=
=20
economy, it appears that investors will use a fine-tooth comb to examine th=
e=20
company's financial records during the increasingly unstable economy.=20

Moreover, in addition to a possible impatience with the growth of technolog=
y=20
and telecommunications stocks, investors may also be concerned that a globa=
l=20
economic slowdown could reduce demand for energy as a whole, resulting in=
=20
lower commodity prices. Drops in the stocks of Dynegy and Williams possibly=
=20
validate this theory. =20

Enron was quick to quell rumors that its stock began to fall as a result of=
=20
problems with its broadband unit. Looking at the big picture, it appears=20
reasonable that the broadband business on its own has not caused the drop i=
n=20
Enron's stock. Rather, Enron shares have mostly likely fallen as a result o=
f=20
several factors. Yes, investors appear to now be less likely to support new=
=20
technologies and telecommunications businesses that have not proven to be=
=20
presently profitable. In addition, Enron is in many ways an enigma. In an=
=20
unstable economy, the uncertainty surrounding Enron's business could prompt=
=20
an unprecedented hesitation about the company's business model. And, lastly=
,=20
Enron is not alone among energy stocks (and stocks in general) that are=20
weathering the fallout of the stock market. On the bright side, Enron still=
=20
remains a very puissant company, despite the sudden drop in its stock price=
.=20
Enron's P/E ratio of 49.99 is still quite strong when compared against othe=
r=20
energy companies. In addition, Enron is a company full of surprises, and it=
=20
is doubtful that any temporary drop in its stock price will keep the compan=
y=20
down for long.=20
