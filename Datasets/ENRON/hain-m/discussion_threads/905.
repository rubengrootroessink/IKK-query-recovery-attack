Enron and Kidventure Camps are proud to bring you Camp Enron Summer 2001.  
Celebrating our third year, Camp Enron  will once again be providing summer 
camp for children, ages 5-13, of Enron employees and contractors. 

This year, camp will be May 29-August 10.  Ten, one-week sessions will be  
available and families may choose to attend any or all sessions.  Each camp 
week is Monday through Friday. 

The cost is $150 per week and includes all transportation, field trips and 
activities.  A deposit of $50 per week is all that is needed to reserve your 
sessions.  

To register, log on to: http://www.kidventurecamp.com/camp_enron.htm.   
Spaces are limited.

Enron parents simply ride to work with  their children and check them in to 
the Energizer room in the morning with the Camp Enron Team.  Enron Campers 
are loaded on Coach USA Buses and transported to our nearby camp. At the end 
of the day campers are brought back to the Energizer for parents to check 
out.  

It's that easy!
