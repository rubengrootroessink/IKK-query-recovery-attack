  ISO Market Participants:
  Last week, we solicited questions for tomorrow's conference
call on implementation issues related to the proposed Market Stabilization
Plan.  Attached are questions we received along with answers based on our
current plans.  We will address these questions and answers - as well as
others that may have arisen since then - at tomorrow's call.
