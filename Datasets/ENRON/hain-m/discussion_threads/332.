Jim - EES is moving forward w/ plans to site mobile generation in AZ - 
hoepfully, by summer (originally, it was locomotive engines, but now may be 
turbines).  They want to have a high level contact between Enron and APS to 
expedite interconnection, but don't know what, if any, business we're doing 
w/ them right now and if any "issues" exist.  Does you have any suggested ENA 
contacts?
