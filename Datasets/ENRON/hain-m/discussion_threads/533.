Sue,

Thanks for letting me know the status of this filing.  I apologize for 
nagging Mary and Alan about this, but it's not everyday that you get a chance 
to make a claim for $50-500 million.  I'd hate to let this one slip though 
our fingers.  If I can help in any way on this, let me know.  There are many 
good reasons to have an underscheduling penalty, and if EPMI happens to get 
paid for accurately scheduling, all the better.

Steve

I heard through the grapevine that you have concerns about what we are doing.

Just to clarify:  We are planning to file on 3/22 in response to the ISO's 
filing to continue to calculate but not charge the penalty.  We will oppose 
the ISO and ask that the ISO charge it.

We are not going to withdraw our previous filing in support of the utilities.

If you have any concerns, please contact me before the end of today.  Or I 
can set up a conference call if you like.
