Hi guys, Jenny Johnson here. My husband and I are running a small bookstore
in space lent to us by Ecclesia Church. I wanted to let you know that they
do have a building permit for the construction going on there; you can see
it in the window of the door that's on the center right as you face the
building. Though they aren't breaking parking codes with their events, they
do realize that they are inconveniencing the neighborhood and will be paving
a lot in the back of their building to alleviate pressure on nearby streets.
They want to be good neighbors and would welcome hearing concerns that
anyone has. 

Also, here's a little plug, while we're at it: The bookstore is called
Strange Land Books. We specialize in classic and contemporary fiction,
culture studies, and Christian theology. We're non-profit, and proceeds
benefit Houston literacy projects. Our opening party is this Fri., Jan. 25,
from 6-9 pm. We'll take twenty percent off all books all night, and have
light refreshments courtesy of the coffeeshop/vegetarian cafe that will also
soon open in the same space.

Please come see us, and if you have any more questions about what's going on
at 2115 Taft, email me with them. If I can't answer, I'll refer you to
someone who can.

Peace,
Jenny
