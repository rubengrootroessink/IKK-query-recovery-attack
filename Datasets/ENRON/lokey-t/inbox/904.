Frazier, in the second sentence I would add "delivery point" after the City of Madison.  Otherwise it looks good to me.  Also, you need to add John Long to any memos about the DVC.  Still haven't talked to Brent Caldwell at Peoples.  Will let you know as soon as we do.  Then we can send out the letter.  Thanks, Tom
