Teb, As we discussed, the Omaha Iron Mountain storage facility contains som=
e 198 boxes of Transwestern documents. These documents came from Transweste=
rn/Houston originally and related to old certificate and rate filings. Beca=
use of the pending acquisition of Northern by Dynegy, Northern needs to iso=
late our storage records. Consequently, were asking you to retrieve and tak=
e ownership of the 198 boxes from the Omaha IM facility. This will involve =
having Houston Iron Mountain initiating the request for shipping from the O=
maha facility and being responsible for the disposition of the boxes when t=
hey are received. The estimated shipping costs to Transwestern for the boxe=
s would be approx. $2,200 - $2,400 . The box numbers for the Transwestern r=
ecords were previously provided to you by letter dated 8/10/01. In addition=
, would you please provide me your cost center #, company #, GL account # a=
nd material # so that the box retrieval fee ($1/box) charged to Northern's =
account by the Omaha Iron Mountain facility can be cross-charged to Transwe=
stern ?=20

If you have any questions or if I can assist in facilitating this request, =
please give me a call.=20
Thanks,=20
