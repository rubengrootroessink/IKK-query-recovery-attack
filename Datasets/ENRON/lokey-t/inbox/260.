It's not about neighborhood issues, but Hilary's complaint reminded me of my
own, which is now two years old.

The police did absolutely NOTHING about a road rage incident where a big
beefy guy came out of his car (during a totally nonmoving traffic jam) and
HIT ME (I'm a little bitty female), then STOLE THE KEYS out of my ignition
and THREW THEM OVER THE EMBANKMENT into the night, then continued to
THREATEN AND HARRASS me for about  20 more minutes until we started moving
again.

We had witnesses, license number, vehicle ID, etc.  I reported it at the
substation.  Nothing.  I followed up with HPD over a period of weeks.
Nothing.  Even went downtown to their office.  Nothing.  Annise Parker even
got pissed off over the story, and tried to use her influence with the cops.
NOTHING.

"To Serve and Protect"   Yeah.  Sure.
