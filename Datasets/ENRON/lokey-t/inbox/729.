Last month we were looking for a sword stand as Christmas gift for our
Rice MBA stockbrokeress who is deeply into Japanese martial arts.  We
finally found an inexpensive one on the Internet.


We may be the only people in the 'hood who hadn't eaten at Texas Chic,
one block west of Leather by the Boots, on the other side of the street
at 712? Fairview.  It's been owned and operated for decades by Teodoro
Gonzalez who lives on Bomar, next to the new townhouses.  He and his wife
make great Puerto Rican food and watching him slice bananas while
carrying on a conversation without taking his eyes off of you is unique
experience.

 <bold><fontfamily><param>Garamond</param>You may have noticed the newly
opened asian antique shop at 807 Fairview, which used to be Leather By
Boots.  Nguyen Brothers, which also converts pots into lamps and frames
pictures by the hour, is run by a hilarious young Vietnamese man named
Theodore.  He is an expert on old Asian things, especially art and china.
 Stop in and talk to him (no need to check with King beforehand...).  You
will be thoroughly entertained!

 <bold><fontfamily><param>Garamond</param>In other news, the owner of
that building is the same man who owns the Hollywood grocery, cigar shop,
and fine reading store on Montrose.  He is going to build a Hollywood
Cafe and Bookstore on Hyde Park and may open a cozy lounge in the
upstairs portion of 807 Fairview.
