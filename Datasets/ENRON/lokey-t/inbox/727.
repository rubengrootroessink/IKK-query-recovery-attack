Attached is a draft agreement regarding the Citizens' contract whereby BP, as agent, has requested the use of an alternate delivery point outside the path.  The tariff permits us to agree to such alternate point and the rate.  We are not required to agree to such alternate point use under the tariff.  Therefore, we do not have to grant this right beyond that which we want, which in this case is a month.  If pressed by BP, we should respond that we are only prepared to agree to such alternate point use for a month.  For those of you unfamiliar with the Global Settlement, the reason we have the right to agree whether we want to amend a customer's  primary or alternates outside the path was to give us the opportunity to recoup the turnback costs.  In other words, by not agreeing in certain instances we may receive incremental revenues to recoup the turnback costs which we are now 100% on the hook for.  


I did not know the Contract No., Lorraine, pls. fill that in.  Given the Dynegy transition, pls. forward any additional comments to Bill Rapp.  Thanks, Maria
