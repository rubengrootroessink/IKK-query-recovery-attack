Shelley,  Tim is looking into these balances.  Tejas has an imbalance we're checking into that developed in December for 211K.  It appears estimates were used for actual flow & we don't have a lot of confidence that that much gas actually flowed.  Mike Wagner tells me the check meter is not working and he has had no luck getting anyone to fix it.  Tim is following up w/Tejas to find out what the actual flow for Dec was.  Also, we're currently working trying to take some of the balances in payback to cover FPL working off their imbalance during the outages we have in process.  We're implementing a process with the team to ensure scheduled quantites are tied out each month so Tim & Cynthia can concentrate on actual flow volumes and reconciliation of any old unreconciled imbalances.  Sheila

I'm concerned about the magnitude of the supply imbalance that we've built up again.  Tim - are these numbers verified and up to date.  Can I get a breakdown of the 1.5 Bcf and the 700 MMcf current month portion.   It seems like we just worked down these balances in the fall and now we're building these balances back up again.  

If these supply imbalances are building up as a result of Phase V outages perhaps the payback gas use should be separately captured and recorded against the project.
