There will be a meeting this Friday with Stan to review the financial forecasts.  No time set.  So we are hustling to get something done by end of today. 

Hey guys, Rod is telling me we have to get the "Business Plan" done soon.  Once we meet with Stan this Friday we will get more guidance on completing the "Business Plan" whose outline is below.  Rod said the Business Plan will need to be completed in the next couple of weeks.  We can review the Plan Outline and assign sections.  Much is Marketing oriented.  Please review the Outline below so it can be discussed on Friday with Stan.

Please treat this as confidential.    Each of you will be responsible for pulling together detailed plans for 2002 and a 5-10 year forecasting model to support a REORG case.  We really need the basic information just mentioned above, yesterday.   Please let me know when I can get it, but I need it tomorrow.   Stan would like to review everything by tuesday next week.    

Assignments for Regulated North America:
Kevin (for Stan):	NNG and Coordination
John(for Bob): 	Citrus/FGT
Tracy(for Steve):	Transwestern
Jerry(for Bill): 	NB Entities
Jim(for Peggy): 	Portland General

For each of you, you will need to pull together the basic information required in the "The Company" part of the Business plan outline for your entity.   Note on the timeline the expectations of the Batchelder people.    Very optimistic, but we probably can get there by early next week.  I will keep you informed as things change.

	
EMAIL FROM Batchelder crew:
	
Attached are two documents:  (1) a time table for the "ReOrg Co" detailed business plan and subsequent valuation calculations and (2) a draft outline for the business plan.  If possible, we would like to meet with each of the business unit heads next week to make sure this time table is reasonable as well as ensure that the various pieces of the business plan are assigned to specific individuals within the business units.  We would welcome any input you have on the business plan outline as well as the overall process. 
	 
I know this is a very large, time consuming project, and we greatly appreciate your continued efforts in this entire process.
	 
Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.
