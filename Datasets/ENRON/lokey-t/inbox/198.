The imbalance becomes part of thecumulative imbalance subject to book-out/cash-out.  The alert day imbalances are treated differently - the alert day imbalances are settled at 200% of the high (weekly) index for overburns on an overage alert day and 50% of the low ( weekly) index for underburns on an underage alert day.

I'm not sure how the mechanics work on OFOs.  I know that there is an OFO penalty bucket.  The customer is charged $10/dth that he is over/under the scheduled quantity.  Section 13A doesn't address how the imbalance on an OFO day is treated but 13.A.5 that states that after Pack/Draft, Alert Day, MSS... are calculated the rest of the imbalance is cumulated into the operator account for the monthly total(should I assume the OFO balance is included in the monthly total?).

In an underage or overage OFO the customer is charged the $10 for the under or over burned amount. Assuming that the customer was in penalty he has to pay $10/dth, but does the imbalance on the OFO day become part of the cumulative monthly balance that the customer can book/cashout?

Teb, is this correct?

Galen, can you have Larry Hill go behind the scene and to see how it was programmed (I know it's a busy day for invoicing but sometime this week?).

Thanks.

Rachel,

To recap one question/answer:

In an OFO situation, the customer faces a $10/Dth penalty.  What happens to
the volume imbalance?  Is it immediately cashed-out as with the Overage
Alert Day, or does it hit the monthly imbalance for cash-out/book-out?

Do I have it right by saying that in an Alert Day situation, the volume is
immediately cashed-out daily?

When you get a minute, please advise.  Thank you!

David
