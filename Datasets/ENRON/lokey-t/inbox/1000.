I am a total procrastinator.

We are leaving for snowy lands this weekend. and as I have never been to Colorado before, it appears that I do not appreciate how cold it is there.  I am looking to borrow appropriate cold weather clothing, women's size 8 or 10, if anyone is willing.  Please let me know ASAP.  Call me at 713-807-7910.

Thanks,

Amy B
