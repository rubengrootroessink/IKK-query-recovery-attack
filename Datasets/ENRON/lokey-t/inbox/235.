I will be walking in the Juvenile Diabetes walk on October 28 and am soliciting sponsors.  If you would like to donate to this cause, please let me know.  For a donation of $25 or more, you will get an Enron JDRF Team T-shirt with our "Mission Possible" theme.  As we all know, Juvenile Diabetes is a disease that affects many children and adults alike.  Insulin is not a cure, only a drug that keeps them alive until a cure is found and a cure is within walking distance.  Please help if you can.

Thanks,
Dortha
