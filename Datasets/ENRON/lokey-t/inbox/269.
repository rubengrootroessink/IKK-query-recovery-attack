Teb:  The following message if from our temporary agency regarding a proofreader for the TW tariff.  Rob wanted to have me print out the tariff from the Unicom database and compare it to a hard copy.  He said he was willing to pay extra for it.  However, Blair thinks he and I could do this a little bit each day.  Give me your thoughts.  (FYI, she would do only straight proofreading.)

Hi Zelda,
 
I believe we may have a candidate for this assignment.
 
Agency said candidate is flexible with pay rate.  Candidate would prefer $19.00 but would work for $18.00.  Agency has said that candidate just coming off a long term assignment where she converted a manual to disk (or vice versa) and then proofread for accuracy.
 
Pay rate $18.00/ Bill rate 30.24
Pay rate $19.00/ Bill rate 31.92
 
Please call me at your earliest convenience.
 
Thanks!
