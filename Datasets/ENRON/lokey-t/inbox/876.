"'Afghanistan will need $10 billion in the next five years, over and above =

Afghanistan today hired Arthur Andersen as its auditor. 'I opened up the Ye=

In a shocking turn of events, Afghanistan today reported that it had a budg=

 country's stunning shift of fortunes to the spirit of the Afghan people, t=
he resolve of the Afghan government and a series of highly complex leveragi=

Thousands of Afghans today cheered as the Eiffel Tower was lowered into pos=

of levity when, shouting orders to the helicopter pilot, he exclaimed, 'Hey=
