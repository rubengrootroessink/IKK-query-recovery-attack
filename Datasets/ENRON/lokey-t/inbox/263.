Bruce Tatro responded quickly and effectively to my needs during a year whe=
n we were living in his district.  That says something about how great it w=
ould be if Neartown had its own council person and state representative, de=
pending on us for votes.  =20

It's funny how different people have different experiences.  We have had nu=
merous problems with the water lines in front of our home--the last resulte=
d in a $798 water bill and we were told to fix it ourselves (get a plumber,=
 actually), even though the city broke and then repaired (?) the line a mon=
th earlier.=20

Anyway, to make a long story short, I used the e-mail list of city councilp=
ersons that Annise supplied to send out an appeal for help.  EVERY councilp=
erson--EXCEPT BRUCE TATRO--responded immediately!  (Annise's office was par=
ticularly caring--Thank you!)  The city repaired the problem within one day=
 and refunded $762 to us.=20

Thanks to EMCA's newsgroup and Annise Parker's list, I guess it IS possible=
 to fight city hall!=20
