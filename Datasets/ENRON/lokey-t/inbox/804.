Daniel works by the hour and is a really hard worker and a nice person.  He 
is from Honduras and speaks only a little English.
To contact him, call me at 713 526-9824  (at 508 Willard).  I will tell him 
you are interested.  He has trapped possums, cleaned floors and done 
gardenign for me.  For others he has done painting, sheetrock,  light 
carpentery, etc.  -- Oakie Domenech
