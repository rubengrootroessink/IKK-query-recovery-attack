The Commission addressed the backhaul issue in Order Nos. 637-A and 637-B.
Bottom line is that backhaul and forward haul cannot overlap.
However, new development is full CD forward haul and full CD backhaul can b=
e delivered at same point.

Here is what the Commission said in Order No. 637-A:

EXAMPLE:

Points:  M=09A=09N=09O=09P=09Q=09R=09B=09=09=09S
___________________________________________________________________________=
____________

=09=09>>>>10,000 FORWARD>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>><<<10,000 BACKHAUL<

=09"Both the releasing and replace shippers also would retain the flexibili=
ty to use their capacity fully to make backhauls.  Thus, the shipper could =
deliver 10,000 Dth from point A to Point B using forward haul capacity and =
10,000 Dth from point S to point B using a backhaul, because there is no ov=
erlap over the mainline.
=09This may require a change by some pipeline with respect to their tariffs=
 regarding backhauls.  The Commission's policy on the use of forwardhauls a=
nd backhauls to the same pont in excess of contract demand has been in the =
process of change.  While the Commission found in 1997 that a shipper canno=
t use the same delivery point for a forwardhaul and backhaul in excess of c=
ontract demand, the Commission recently found that a forwardhaul and backha=
ul to a series of 23 meter station considered as a single point for nominat=
ion purposes did not result in a capacity overlap even though the total amo=
unt received by the shipper exceeded contract demand.  In order to promote =
shippers' ability to use their capacity as flexibly as possible, the Commis=
sion has determined that prior restrictions on shippers' use of forwardhaul=
s and backhauls to the same point should not be followed.  Shippers' segmen=
tation right should not depend on metaphysical distinctions between deliver=
y to a single point or to two points adjacent to each other.  In both situa=
tions, shippers should be permitted to use a forwardhaul and a backhaul to =
deliver gas as long as the mainline contract demand is not exceeded and the=
y can take delivery of the gas."  (Footnotes omitted.)

In Order No. 637-B, the Commission addressed requests of INGAA, Williams an=
d the El Paso pipelines for rehearing of this very point. The Commission de=
nied rehearing, repeating much of what it had said in Order No. 637-A.


NOTE:  Seems like there is more than a "metaphysical" difference between de=
liveries to a single point versus two points.  However, the Commission does=
 recognize that there may be a physical constraint, and maybe even a schedu=
ling constraint.
