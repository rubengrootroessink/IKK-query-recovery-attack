Neighbors, yesterday four cars were vandalized at Bomar St. The  glass 
windows were shatered. My cousin from Michigan was visiting me. The window 
behind the driver's seat was broken. The police was at Bomar and Grant with 
the same problem. I am sick and tired of this abuse. And yesterday I was also 
ashamed. It's not only the broken glass is all the secondary effects that 
this kind of incidents cause to the victim. And the perpetrators are probably 
laughing at all of us. Because for them is probably a joke. I am sorry of 
giving all of you this news in this beautiful day but we need to be aware. 
Happy Holidays. Feliz Navidad. Hedda, 416 Bomar.
