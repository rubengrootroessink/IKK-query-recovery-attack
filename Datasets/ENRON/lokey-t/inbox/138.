Dear Julie,

I don't know if this is in time or not. We just got back from camping 
at Enchanted Rock for the long weekend (the kids were off school 
today).

We had our protest hearing for our set-back application on 9/20
before the Planning Commission. There was one property owner
who protested our application, so we had to go to the public hearing.
The short story is that our application was approved and forwarded 
on to City Council, the last step in the process before Peden is
protected from building closer to the street than the average of the 
existing buildings. We applied from Montrose to Taft on both sides 
of Peden. The Planning & Development Dept. (P&DD) records showed 
that we had 76% in favor, and most of the remaining 24% we couldn't
locate to ask to sign before we turned it in. There were two properties
that we slated to be demolished and converted to new townhouses.
With the new set-back in place, new construction is still allowed and
there are no other restriction placed on properties. We're just one step 
away from being protected for 20 years. The guy who protested said
he was planning to tear down two adjacent single story bungalows 
and build townhouses on the double lot. Mike Yates was the co-
applicant, but there was a lot of support and 20% of the signatories 
showed up at the protest hearing! Sorry if this is disjointed, but
I'm really tired from our backpacking and climbing.

Hope this is in time! Let me know if there are any questions.

Carmen

P.S. We saw your van over in Southhampton a couple weeks ago!
