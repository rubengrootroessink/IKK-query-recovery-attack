Hi Kelly!  You should be receiving two boxes in the morning containing the Red Rock files.  I have included a listing of what is included in each box.  Any questions, please feel free to call me at 7138 here in Omaha.  

As we discussed on the phone, this was a pretty clean order with the following notifications/conditions remaining:
notice of end of construction & in-service date
notice of actual costs
notice of abandonment of original units (Note: We received approval to maintain the ability to operate the existing units up to 6 months after the installation of the new units to insure continuity of service.  The new units and existing units can NOT run simultaneously).
noise surveys at Stations 3 (and 4 if applicable)  (The base noise surveys for Sta 3 & 4 indicated noise levels right at or close to 55 Ldn.   FERC therefore conditioned us with conducting noise surveys on these two stations to ensure the final noise level was within the 55 Ldn limit.  The surveys for Sta 1 & 2 indicated a noise level below 55 Ldn; FERC, therefore, did not condition us.  Larry is still conducting surveys on all stations to ensure levels are within 55 Ldn).
as with all construction projects, any change in the construction or mitigation measures must be requested and director's letter received.

NOTE:  There is a cultural resource site at Station 1 that is suppose to be fenced-in DURING CONSTRUCTION per SHPO and FERC.  As of our conference call on Thursday, this area had not been fenced in yet.   The fencing needs to be permanent and maintained during the ongoing operation of the station.

Also, as we discussed, on November 26, 2001 (I believe that is the correct date) we filed a request for an extension of time to replace the units at Station 4.  We have not heard anything from FERC.  In fact, altho it is included in the Daily Listing of FERC's website, it has not been scanned in on the individual docket site.   Discussions Keith had with Lon Stanton, it was decided to not contact FERC.   

Also, as we also discussed, they are currently planning on overhauling the units at Station 4 during March, April and May 2002.  These units were due for an overhaul, but were postponed as a result of the Red Rock filing.  Since it is unlikely that the units will be replaced at this time, the existing units need to be overhauled to ensure the integrity and continuation of service for Transwestern's system.  The overhauls are NOT A PART OF THE RED ROCK PROJECT.  

Good Luck!!!
