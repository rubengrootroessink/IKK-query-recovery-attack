Well Neighbors,
It has happened to us as well.  We have a guest staying with us for a couple 
of weeks and his car was parked in front of our house.  Sunday morning we 
awoke to his window smashed and his radio missing.   This crime wave is very 
very aggravating.   

We live on the 900 blk of Bomar.  We have filed a report with the police.
