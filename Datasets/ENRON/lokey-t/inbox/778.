Hey guys,

If you read the January EMCA newsletter, you prolly noticed that there were stories that were amazingly similar to what has been buzzing around on our e-mail-internet site.  Well, I often go to our e-group for information that can be printed in the newsletter, but this month your stories practically were the entire newsletter.  

I hope you don't mind that I took this information and wrote it in the newsletter... Actually, for me, the newsletter editor, it was a goldmine, because those are exactly the types of things that make our newsletter newsy and personal.  I have been wanting restaurant and business reviews (Cheryl has been a big help), and I've been meaning to get down to the new little antique store so I could write about it, but haven't made it during business hours.  Your information made it possible to let the neighborhood know about these places.

Thanks guys.

Julie Young
