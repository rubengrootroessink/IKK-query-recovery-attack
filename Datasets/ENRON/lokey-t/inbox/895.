is his dog missing? I had to take that puppy to the spca cause he was an escape artist
somebody told me that a family had taken this dog in for about a week, but it kept getting out and they didn't want the responsibility anymore

  That could be "Zorro" - he lives at 904 Bomar - Gary is his dad.

    anyone missing or know someone who is missing a young, black male lab-mix?
    found him wandering around the street today - not very car-wise...
