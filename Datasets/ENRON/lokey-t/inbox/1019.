The property is on th southwest corner of Welch and Morgan (400 block).  There
are big new townhouses.  I would guess that the plans have been approved by the
City, prior to building.  Two things that we need to keep in mind.  This
property was abandoned building s prior to the new development, and there was
no visible existing sidewalks on Welch or Morgan before the new construction
began.  In fact, the plants that were growing there were offered for the taking
prior to construction.  Also, if you drive by, you will notice a grand old tree
in the public right-of-way, and it would be very difficult to put in a standard
sidewalk without killing the tree.

However, if you want to reach the proper City department to doublecheck, you
can call 311 and they will get you to the right people.
