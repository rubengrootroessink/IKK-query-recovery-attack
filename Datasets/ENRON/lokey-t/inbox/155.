Wow!  EMCA is really getting serious about this communication thing!  Maybe there's a way we can also turn this to use in security matters. 

Speaking of which, Capt. Yorek, who heads Central Division, of which we are a tiny part, and I were at a luncheon together yesterday.  He was there to talk about the month-long anti-vice sweep they ran.  They were particularly trying to break up teenage prostitution and dope dealing in the Neartown neighborhoods.  They made 100 arrests.  They are now doing follow-up sweeps.  He also said that they are trying to cut down the rampant auto burglaries going on in our area.  Emphasized to park under lights where possible and to not leave anything in sight in your car.  We had a car break-in at my house only this week.  They are also working with our storefront to try to reduce graffiti, which has again been very active.

We have an official domain name now, www.eastmontrose.org, and a web site 
for general information and informative links.  I will be managing the 
domain and site, so please let me know if you have any suggestions. 

This will not take the place of our email list server, but be an adjunct to 
it. 

Thanks in advance for any ideas,
