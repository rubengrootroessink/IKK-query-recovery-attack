"If nothing else, John Walker has usefully nailed one of the self-serving m=
yths peddled after the awesome intelligence failure of September 11th: Awfu=
lly sorry we failed to see it coming, said the high-ranking suits, but it's=
 impossible to do any covert deep-cover stuff out in Afghanistan; these fel=
lows are all cousins and brothers-in-law -- a guy from Jersey would stick o=
ut like a lap-dancer in a burqa. As we now know, instead of being full of f=
earsome Pashtun warriors renowned down the centuries, the Omar/Osama ranks =
were like a novelty Gap ad, 'Losers of Many Nations' -- misfit Saudis and P=
akis, Brits and Californians. Anyone can walk in off the street and be assi=
stant supervisor of the third-floor latrine in Tora Bora by nightfall. The =
only distinguishing feature about John Walker is that he's such an obvious =
compendium of clapped-out clich?s from America's Left Coast the wonder is t=
he mullahs didn't automatically take him for a CIA plant.
=20
But no, Mr. Walker is for real -- born John Lindh in 1981, and from that ba=
stion of well-heeled  dopehead progressivism, California's affluent Marin C=
ounty. Following the traditional Marin pattern, his parents divorced, his m=
other converted to Buddhism and the children were taught Native American sp=
irituality. John was sent to an 'alternative' high school. (In the Bay Area=
, all the high schools are 'alternative.' The problem for parents is trying=
 to find any alternative to the alternative.) The set texts included The Au=
tobiography Of Malcolm X, and John liked it so much that like the late Mr. =
X he too decided to embrace Islam and change his name, to Sulayman. His par=
ents, putting their foot down for what seems to be the first and last time,=
 demanded the right to continue calling him John. They had, after all, gone=
 to the trouble of naming him after one of the colossi of the age, John Len=
non. To this, he
 consented. In return, they let him study at the Mill Valley Islamic Center=
.
=20
In 1998, after an awkward trip to their ancestral Ireland in which John tru=
dged dutifully round the auld sod wearing his turban and white robes, Frank=
 Lindh agreed to let his 17-year old son spend a year in Yemen, on the next=
 stage of his 'spiritual odyssey.' He was just another middle-class kid who=
'd gone off to find himself, but, like most of the others, he always knew h=
ow to find daddy when he needed to. Last year, John e-mailed home to say al=
-Qaeda's attack on the USS Cole was justified -- oh, and by the way he was =
off to enroll in a Pakistani madrassa. So Dad wired him a couple thousand b=
ucks, which goes a long way in Bannu. Aside from a glowing school report fr=
om his Imam, that was the last Mr. Lindh heard from Junior until he turned =
up brandishing an AK-47 while battling U.S. armed forces and declaring his =
approval of the events of September 11th.
=20
John Walker's CV bears eloquent testament to his parents' scrupulous observ=
ance of the Bay Area's First Commandment: 'Thou shalt be non-judgmental.' Y=
eah, man, Yemen. Cool. Whatever's your bag. As one headline put it: 'A Prod=
uct Of Bay Area Culture.' Exactly, I thought. But, this being The San Franc=
isco Chronicle, they were applying the label with pride. Rhapsodizing about=
 the area's 'religious tolerance' and the way children are taught 'to accep=
t other cultures' and value 'critical thinking about the U.S. role in the w=
orld,' senior writer Louis Freedberg concluded that Walker's only misfortun=
e was that 'his search for identity intersected precisely with the World Tr=
ade Center attacks.' If not for this unfortunate 'intersection' Walker migh=
t have become an 'idealistic doctor.' The President, he said, should allow =
the boy home 'and let him get his life back on track. We'd want nothing les=
s for our own children, who could easily have found themselves in a similar=
 mess.'
=20
In fairness to the youth of northern California, that last part is an unjus=
t slur. The marvel is that, after labouring under the twin burdens of the e=
ducation system's multicultural orthodoxies and the preening moral superior=
ity of their Boomer parents, no more Bay Area teens have signed on with Mul=
lah Omar. Nonetheless, there is a difference between 'tolerance' of other c=
ultures and the moral inertia displayed  by the Lindhs. We can, in any case=
, guess the limits of Marin County's much-vaunted 'tolerance.' Imagine that=
 the Marinated Muslim had instead announced that he was going to do what th=
e late (CIA agent) Mike Spann did at his age: enlist in the Marines. Would =
Marilyn Walker have seen that as a valid part of her son's 'self-discovery'=
? Or would she have got out her joss sticks and wailed, 'Oh, my God, where =
did we go wrong?'
=20
Mom says she's 'proud' of John, but is taking the line he must have been 'b=
rainwashed.' From the look of him, his brain's the only thing that's been w=
ashed. John Walker resembles one of those hairy, smelly, cadaverous, vaguel=
y deranged guys who stumble up to you late at night at remote Greyhound sta=
tions and demand money for medication. But right now that's shrewd image-po=
sitioning. President Bush seems to have bought the 'misguided' line, descri=
bing Walker as a 'poor fellow' who thought he was fighting for a 'great cau=
se.' 'I can't see him as being unpatriotic,' says a neighbour. 'This is whe=
re his journey led him.' And, anyway, as everyone says, he's just a 'boy.'
=20
John Walker is a 20-year old man -- though one can sympathize if protracted=
 exposure to the Bay Area's 'critical thinking' (if only) has left him in a=
 state of arrested development. For four decades, supposedly 'non-judgmenta=
l' flower-children like Marilyn Walker have reflexively characterized CIA m=
en like Mike Spann as the dark agents of right-wing militarism. We are enti=
tled to judge Marilyn's son, the comrade of Spann's killers, as the dark ag=
ent of left-wing Marinism. Raised by peaceniks and Marinated in 'tolerance,=
' he took up an AK-47 in defence of misogynists and gay-bashers: not an int=
ernal contradiction, but the logical reductio of the new left's moral nulli=
ty. Cocooned in one of the most prosperous enclaves on the planet, he was t=
aught everything -- from Buddhism to Indian spirituality to Malcolm X -- ev=
erything except what it means to be an American citizen.
=20
When a 13-year-old girl wants an abortion, the Marin County crowd insists t=
hat 'a woman's right to choose is sacred (and even parental notification ta=
boo). Twenty-year-old men make choices, too. John Walker chose to go to war=
 against his own country. Americans should respect his 'right to choose' an=
d let him live with the consequences.
=20
I'm not in favour of trying him for treason: Alan Dershowitz and the other =
high-rent lawyers are already salivating over the possibility of a two-year=
 circus with attendant book deals and TV movies. But there is another way, =
suggested the other day by the Sun's Peter Worthington. In 1944, lacking th=
e benefits of an immersion in Bay Area 'critical thinking,' the teenage Wor=
thington volunteered for the Royal Canadian Navy, but, unlike Walker's apol=
ogists, he at least treats him as an adult exercising free will. As Mr. Wor=
thington notes, on page four of John Walker's U.S. passport it states that =
any American who enlists in a foreign army can be stripped of his citizensh=
ip. Mr. Walker wants to be Abdul Hamid: Mr. Bush should honour his wishes. =
Let us leave him to the Northern Alliance and let his fancy-pants 'Frisco l=
awyers petition to appear before the Kabul bar, if there is one. It would, =
surely, be grossly discriminatory to subject Mr. Hamid to non-Islamic justi=
ce."
