The following items were discussed in this week's ETS and Corporate Change Control Items...
Sept. 24	
From 12:00 a.m. through 10/07 at 11:45 p.m., Enron Network Services is implementing a moratorium on all network changes one week prior through one week after the first move of users to Enron Center South.  This moratorium will probably be limited to routing changes, no new networks, no changes to existing networks, etc.  No impact to ETS networks is expected.

Oct. 4		
From 9:00 a.m. - 6:00 p.m., the EDI team will replace the backup EDI server located in Omaha.   The existing server will be de-commissioned.  The new server will take over the dns and IP address of the old server.   No impact is expected as this server is used for disaster recovery.

Oct. 4		
From 11:00 p.m. through 10/5 at 2:00 a.m., the Unix team will rename the edinet.enron.com and ecnet.enron.com systems.  During last Saturday's EDI change, the DNS entries were changes but the actual servers were not changed to reflect their new names.  They will also install patches to the machines during the maintenance.  This change will result in a total disruption of service to EDI Web access only.  EDI will not be affected.

Oct. 5		
From 4:00 - 6:00 p.m., the Monitoring group will bring up the new ITContacts site and disable the old.  We are currently not using this site but there are plans to access it in the future.  No impact is expected.

Oct. 5		
From 7:00 - 8:00 p.m., the Corp server team will perform maintenance on the HR-DB-4 server to add more disk space.  This change will result in a disruption of service to all HR Global applications including eHRonline, GCS, GIS, expertfinder, etc.

Oct. 5		
From 9:00 - 11:00 p.m., Enron Network Services will split the two 8 port gig channels from ECS to ECN into four 4 port gig channels.  This change will fully mesh the ECS core.  No impact is expected.

Oct. 5		
From 9:00 - 11:45 p.m., the Messaging team will Test Upgrade functions of XTND 2.6.  This change affects PDA users who log into XTND.  No impact to ETS users is expected.  X-tend Connect Proxy servers will be unavailable on 10/5/01 from 9:00-11:45pm.  Palm Pilot users who use X-tend Connect Proxy to sync with Outlook will be unable to do so during this time.  

Oct. 5		
From 9:00 p.m. through 10/6 at 1:00 a.m., the Messaging team will reboot all Corp and EI Notes servers.  No impact to ETS users is expected.

Oct. 5		
From 10:00 - 10:15, Enron Network Services will migrate the following Corp servers on the 172.16.63.0 network:  foglight, charon, hyperion, perch, diablo, vision, ricky, dbadmin, worf, riker, europa, titania, pandora, ferrari, pluto, hades, opal, cyclopes, astral, and modena.  No impact to ETS is expected.
