Hi Teb!

It's right around the corner, that special day in February. 
And it's a good time to think of your previous sweethearts.

Take a look now and see if you can find some of those special 
Valentines from your past!

Higher Learning
Go back to the simpler times of keggers, all-nighters and 
more with our new College directory. Add yourself to any of 
more than 30,000 colleges and universities. Who says you 
can't go back to college? Not us!

With our new College directory, finding those old friends 
(and those old more-than-just friends) has never been easier.

So if you haven't already, add yourself to our College 
directory. Once you do, you're just a few clicks away from 
finding even more old friends (and Valentines!)

Wendy Dickerman
