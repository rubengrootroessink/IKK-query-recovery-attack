Please mark your calendars:

Tuesday, December 18th, from 6:30 to 9:00, EMCA will host its first 
December holiday party.  The party will be held at our regular 
meeting place, at 807 Welch.

Dinner will be pot-luck, with Tom Williams of Fox Diner and Cafe 
Zorro providing the main course.  EMCA will provide beverages, and 
entertainment.

Please bring a dish - either a starter/salad, a vegetable, or a 
dessert.

For those who are interested, we will be holding a White Elephant 
gift exchange - a great opportunity to get rid of that what-cha-ma-
jigger that's been sitting around the house (and to get a possibly 
much more interesting thing-a-ma-bob!).

Additionally, clean out your pantries - EMCA will be taking your 
canned good food donations to local charities.

*******

Now, I have a request.  I need some people to help me distribute a 
flyer for the party to the neighborhood, either today, tomorrow, or 
Tuesday.  If you can volunteer, please email me, or call me at 713-
807-7910.

*******

Thanks a million, and we hope to see you next Tuesday!

Happy Holidays,

Amy Barnes
EMCA President
