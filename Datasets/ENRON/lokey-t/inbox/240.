Per Jan's recent Commission meeting summary I just noticed the Commission had added a discussion item on OFOs.  They didn't get to this at yesterday's meeting, but will take up on Oct. 11.  Help Joe -- what is this about?  Is there some possibility of the FERC curbing our ability to use OFOs?  This is an absolutely critical tool for us to keep -- even though we seldom use.  Where/when can we make our case.
