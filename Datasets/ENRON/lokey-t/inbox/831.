I saw you guys down the street on Sunday with the cops out front.  Our other
neighbors said that THREE houses were robbed as well - at 3:00am while they
were asleep.  My details are sketchy but they said that people were breaking
into their back sheds and laundry rooms.  Still very scary ~ since everyone
was home at the time.  We are locking our gate  from now on!

Well Neighbors,
It has happened to us as well.  We have a guest staying with us for a couple

of weeks and his car was parked in front of our house.  Sunday morning we 
awoke to his window smashed and his radio missing.   This crime wave is very

very aggravating.   

We live on the 900 blk of Bomar.  We have filed a report with the police.
