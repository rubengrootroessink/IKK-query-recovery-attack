Hi guys.

I'm working on the February newsletter and would like to include a tiny biography about our new officers.  

About you, and about your ties to the neighborhood, or anything else you would like to include, and which space permits.

For instance, what you do for a living, who you live with, kids, what street you live on, when you moved here, why you choose this 'hood, pets, hobbies, etc.  Doin't worry - we won't be too revealing...There will probably be only a sentence or two per person.  But we think it will make people feel more like they are acquainted with the officers if we can print a little bit about them.

Please erase the EMCA address in the "To:" box, and send your response directly to me at

theJulles@msn.com

AND

theJulles@hotmail.com

or call and leave it on my machine (713) 528-5614

or drop it in my mailslot at 2117 Stanford at Drew.

Thanks

Julie Young
