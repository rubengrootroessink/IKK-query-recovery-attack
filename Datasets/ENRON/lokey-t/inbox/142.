For weeks we've all wondered about that unsightly dirt pile with rebar
sticking up and whether the City would actually do something about it.

Well, I mentioned it last Thursday to Rick Ehrlich, the builder who is
doing that project between Bomar and Peden (and who also did that
terrific renovation of Las  Brisas at Stanford and Fairview).  The next
day he had his crew remove it.  Nice gesture from a local builder  and
neighbor.
