Neighbors - VH-1 are filming a television movie at Lovett and Stanford.  Lulu and I stopped in this morning and they were filming on the sidewalk.  It's interesting (for about 10 minutes) if you've never seen a movie set - lots of people, activity, etc.  We didn't see any stars, but you never know!
