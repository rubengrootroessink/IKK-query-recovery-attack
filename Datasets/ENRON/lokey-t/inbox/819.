Guys from the environmental side, this looks like a no brainer, if all we a=
re goning to do is add a cooler and no horsepower.  Because this will be an=
 increase in capacity it will probably be a 7C project by FERC and require =
an environmental report to be prepared.  The only glitch I see is the noise=
 survey and possibly some abatement or modifications to the cooler to reduc=
e the post construction noise levels. It would also be helpful to know whic=
h facility we are talking about.......

Don't know if you have seen this.....but it looks like it is a hot one.  De=
pending on how the FERC filing was left and how the air permits are current=
ly configured, this may not need any approvals.  Earl, are you in the lead =
on this or is Power Systems like on Station 1??

I would like to pursue as quickly as possible the option of adding the cool=
ers to get the incremental 10,000/d. Please proceed with developing a more =
exact cost estimate and determining from a materials standpoint what  the t=
iming of the project might be. Thanks.

Marketing requested Planning to review any and all possibilities to achieve=
 small volume expansions through the San Juan lateral.  Several facility sc=
enarios were investigated by Planning which are in the attached Excel sprea=
dsheet.  Most if not all are too costly to justify installing.  However, th=
ere is another option that is not listed in the attached that was a late en=
try.  Discussions with Engineering have determined that by cooling the inle=
t air to the turbines would increase the available horsepower.  That in tur=
n would increase the station's overall throughput.  Preliminary studies ind=
icate that approximately 10 MMcf/d of additional throughput could be realiz=
ed if inlet air cooling is installed.  The + 30% estimate for two units wou=
ld be $600,000.  BIG bargain compared to the options in the attached file. =
 The facility installation is not a major job but the FERC approval to util=
ize additional horsepower could take 6 - 9 months.  Other considerations to=
 review would be the air quality permit for the increase in horsepower, and=
 potential environmental clearances to do construction.  Let me know what y=
ou think about this suggestion.  Please feel free to call.
