Rachel, attached is a spreadsheet with SFTS conversion information as you requested.  I sent Frazier and Teb a note to advise if these customers must have consecutive releases in order to keep their FTS-1 contracts active and am awaiting their feedback.  Please let me know if you want to see this in a different format or with additional information.  Also, I did not fill in the date that the FTS-1 contracts revert back to SFTS because it all depends on whether we leave the contracts open for monthly releases.  nb
