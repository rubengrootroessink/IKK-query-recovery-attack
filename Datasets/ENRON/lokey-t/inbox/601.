The following items were presented in this week's corporate change control....

Dec. 14		
From 8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m., the EDI team will install and upgrade Oracle to version 8.1.7 on EDI_QA.   This change will result in a total disruption of service to the EDI_QA environment.

Dec. 14		
From 10:00 - 11:00 p.m., Enron Network Services will clean up routing between ecn-34-prd-dcr7/8 and ecn-34-trd-dcr1/2 which are part of the old ECT networks.  No impact to the ETS users is expected.

Dec. 14		
From 10:30 p.m. through 12/15 at 2:00 a.m., Enron Network Services will remove routing from the 192.168.73.x interfaces on ENA-CR1-ARD and ENA-CR2-ARD. This change will result in an intermittent disruption of service to devices on the ETS Ardmore networks.  This change will not affect devices on the 10.0.0.0 segment.  The outage is expected to last for less than two minutes.  This change is necessary to fully implement the new MAN.  

Jan. 7		
From 7:00 a.m. through 1/11 at 5:00 p.m., Facilities will perform the annual maintenance on the rooftop chillers.  The chillers will be taken down one at a time during the maintenance.  No impact to ETS is expected.
