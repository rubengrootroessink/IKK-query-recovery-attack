Another tidbit to remind us that we see/hear Divinity all around us: 

Just remember, "Our God is an Awesome God!" 

READ This All the Way, and send it back please! 
This will give you the chills.....GOOD Chills! 

A young man had been to Wed. night Bible Study. The pastor had shared 
about listening to God and obeying the Lord's voice. The young man 
couldn't help but wonder, Does God still speak to people?" 

After service, he went out with some friends for coffee 
and pie, and they discussed the message. Several different ones talked 
about how God had led them in different ways. 

It was about ten o'clock when the young man started driving home. 
Sitting in his car, he just began to pray, "God...If you still speak to 
people speak to me. I will listen. I will do my best to obey." 

As he drove down the main street of his town, he had the strangest 
thought to stop and buy a gallon of milk. He shook his head and said out 
loud, "God is that you?"  He didn't get a reply and started on toward 
home. 

But again, the thought, buy a gallon of milk. The young man thought 
about Samuel and how he didn't recognize the voice of God, and how 
little Samuel ran to Eli. "Okay, God, in case that is you, I will buy 
the milk." It didn't seem like too hard a test of obedience. He could 
always use the milk. He stopped and purchased the gallon of milk and 
started off toward home. 

As he passed Seventh Street, he again felt the urge, "Turn down that 
street." This is crazy he thought and drove on past the intersection. 
Again, he felt that he should turn down Seventh Street. At the next 
intersection, he turned back and headed down Seventh. Half jokingly, he 
said out loud, "Okay, God, I will." 

He drove several blocks, when suddenly, he felt like he should stop. 
He pulled over to the curb and looked around. He was in a 
semi-commercial area of town. It wasn't the best but it wasn't the worst 
of neighborhoods either. The businesses were closed and most of the 
houses looked dark like the people were already in bed. 

Again, he sensed something, "Go and give the milk to the people in the 
house across the street." The young man looked at the house. It was dark 
and it looked like the people were either gone or they were already 
asleep. He started to open the door and then sat back in the car seat. 
"Lord, this is insane. Those people are asleep and, if I wake them up, 
they are going to be mad and I will look stupid." 

Again, he felt like he should go and give the milk. Finally, he opened 
the door.   "Okay God, if this is you, I will go to the door and I will 
give them the milk. If you want me to look like a crazy person, okay. I 
want to be obedient. I guess that will count for something, but, if they 
don't answer right away, I am out of here. 

He walked across the street and rang the bell. He could hear some noise 
inside. A man's voice yelled out, "Who is it? What do you want?"   Then 
the door opened before the young man could get away.    The man was 
standing there in his jeans and t-shirt.  He looked like he just got out 
of bed. He had a strange look on his face, and he didn't seem too happy 
to have some stranger standing on his doorstep. "What is it?" The young 
man thrust out the gallon of milk. "Here I brought this to you." 

The man took the milk and rushed down a hallway, speaking loudly in 
Spanish. Then from down the hall came a woman carrying the milk toward 
the kitchen. The man was following her holding a baby. The baby was 
crying. The man had tears streaming down his face. The man began 
speaking and half-crying, "We were just praying. We had some big bills 
this month and we ran out of money. We didn't have any milk for our 
baby. I was just praying and asking God to show me how to get some 
milk." 

His wife in the kitchen yelled out, "I ask him to send an Angel with 
some. Are you an Angel?" 

The young man reached into his wallet and pulled out all the money he 
had on him and put in the man's hand. He turned and walked back toward 
his car and the tears were streaming down his face.   He knew that God 
still answers prayers. 

This is a simple test... 

If you believe that God is alive and well, send this to at least ten 
people and the person that sent it to you!
