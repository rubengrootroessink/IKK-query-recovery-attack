Attached for your review and comments is a revised version of the TransPecos LOI. This version (which reflects comments received from Kim and Mark this afternoon) is red-lined to show changes from the version that I circulated earlier in the week. It's my understanding that we'll be meeting on this at 10:00 a.m. on Tuesday, January 22.
