ETS is developing a web-based Emergency Response Information (ERI) system to provide access to employee contact information including work phone, home phone, cell phone, fax number and pager numbers. To facilitate and manage the collection of personal contact data, a new field has been added to eHRonline. Beginning Monday, October 1, all ETS employees will be prompted to either ACCEPT or DECLINE publication of personal data (i.e., home phone number) when first entering the eHRonline system. All ETS employees should access the eHRonline system at their first opportunity to respond to this new request.

While certain positions within ETS mandate disclosure of personal contact data (i.e., home phone number) for emergency response purposes, in other cases disclosure of this information is at the discretion of the employees. If you are an ETS Operations employee and do not want your home phone number published, please contact your Director prior to electing not to publish your personal contact information. 

To access eHRonline, go to the ETS HRWeb link: https://ehronline.enron.com/ and select eHRonline. Employees must enter their SAP Personnel Number and Password to enter the system.  If you do not know your SAP Personnel Number or Password, please contact the Integrated Solutions Center at (713)-345-4727.
