There have been many questions concerning the United Way contributions.  Enron will not be matching the UW donations and many of you have expressed interest in directing your contribution to another charity.  
If you want to make a change or eliminate your United Way contribution, please send an email to HR Service Connection and indicate if the contribution was for either 2001 or 2002 and which payroll period.  
Please note that no one is encouraging individuals to make changes/delete contributions but, times have changed and employees have a different situations.  Thank you.
