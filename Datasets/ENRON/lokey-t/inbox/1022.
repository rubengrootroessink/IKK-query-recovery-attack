Martin,
Thanks for the facts.  I am amazed at the lengths you've taken to "do the right thing" and greatly appreciate you shedding light on the truth
The homes you built at Welch and Morgan are beautiful and I hope you continue to construct in the Montrose area.  The style, quality and craftsmanship greatly add to the community.  I hope to see more of your work
in the future.
You are the kind of person I'd gladly do business with.
EH
