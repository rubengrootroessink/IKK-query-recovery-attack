Teb and Steve - my comments (from k. allen)

CP01-115 order issued 7/16,2001;  Paragraph D, under Commission Orders, states that all facilities must be in-service within one year from the issuance of a final order.  

It appears from the RR Weekly Report (1/10/02) that Stations for 1 and 2 will not be in-service until mid-June 2002, and Station 3 until July 2002. 

If Lorraine is asking whether TW can use or find existing capacity in order to flow incremental RR volume until Stations 1 and 2 are in-service, I think the answer is yes.   I didn't read anything in the order that prohibits TW  (in fact TW does mention possible in-service delays in the order).  If the TW RR schedule slides, TW should consider filing an amendment requesting additional time to complete construction.

Please note, included in this report is a delayed in-service schedule for Red Rock.

Stations 1/2 June 15, 2002
Station 3 July 1, 2002

Do we want to tell our shippers yet or wait and also do we want to try to use existing space for the Oneok deal so we do not loose out on any revenue?
