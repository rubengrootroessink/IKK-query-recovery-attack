A few oldies being recycled:

1. Don't sweat the petty things and don't pet the sweaty things.

2. One tequila, two tequila, three tequila, floor. 
3. Atheism is a non-prophet organization. 
4. If man evolved from monkeys and apes, why do we still have
monkeys and apes? 
5. The main reason Santa is so jolly is because he knows where
all the bad girls live.
6. I went to a bookstore and asked the saleswoman, "Where's the
self help section?" She said if she told me, it would defeat the
purpose. 
7. What if there were no hypothetical questions? 
8. If a deaf person swears, does his mother wash his hands with
soap? 
9. If a man is standing in the middle of the forest speaking
and there is no woman around to hear him ... is he still wrong? 
10. If someone with multiple personalities threatens to kill
himself, is it considered a hostage situation? 
11. Is there another word for synonym? 
12. Isn't it a bit unnerving that doctors call what they do
"practice"? 
13. What do you do when you see an endangered animal eating an
endangered plant? 
14. If a parsley farmer is sued, can they garnish his wages? 
15. Would a fly without wings be called a walk?
