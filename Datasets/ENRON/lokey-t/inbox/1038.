Can we set up a phone conference sometime next Tuesday.
Rachel and I have some questions.
Is 10:00 am a good time?
If not, how about 2:00 pm?

FYI -  NBPL and MGT are going to proceed with implementing the PAL transactions posting under the Interruptible Agreements Informational Postings as indicated in Geneva Patterson's e-mail dated February 1 and are targeting April 1 as the first day.

Thanks,
