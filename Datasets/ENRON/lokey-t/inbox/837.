To all,

Given today's e-mail traffic, I would like to invite everyone to attend next
month's EMCA meeting.  We will be talking about major projects that we may
want to undertake in the coming year.  I went to the PIP meeting last week
and we discussed the the process involved for setting up an official
citizen's patrol in our neighborhood.  If we, as a group, decide this is
necessary, then we can work with the Storefront to get rained and then the
police will provide us with all of the official signs to post on streets and
patrol cars.  They said  that crime normally shows a significant decrease in
neighborhoods that have taken on the responsibility of a patrol.  Also, my
husband, Bruce Hastings, has volunteered to be the PIP representative this
year, so he will be interested in tracking these trends.

I hope that everyone will try to come on the February 19th for the discussion
of what we want to put on our plate for next year.

See you there!
Cheryl Hastings
