Please plan to attend a meeting to discuss moving forward on the expansion =
of the San Juan Lateral (as stated in Ron's memo below).  The meeting will =
be on Thursday, 1/24 from 2:00 - 3:00 pm in EBN 1336.  Larry - the phone # =
is 713-345-2846.  Thank you.

I would like to pursue as quickly as possible the option of adding the cool=
ers to get the incremental 10,000/d. Please proceed with developing a more =
exact cost estimate and determining from a materials standpoint what  the t=
iming of the project might be. Thanks.

Subject:=09San Juan Expansion Options - Small Volume

Marketing requested Planning to review any and all possibilities to achieve=
 small volume expansions through the San Juan lateral.  Several facility sc=
enarios were investigated by Planning which are in the attached Excel sprea=
dsheet.  Most if not all are too costly to justify installing.  However, th=
ere is another option that is not listed in the attached that was a late en=
try.  Discussions with Engineering have determined that by cooling the inle=
t air to the turbines would increase the available horsepower.  That in tur=
n would increase the station's overall throughput.  Preliminary studies ind=
icate that approximately 10 MMcf/d of additional throughput could be realiz=
ed if inlet air cooling is installed.  The + 30% estimate for two units wou=
ld be $600,000.  BIG bargain compared to the options in the attached file. =
 The facility installation is not a major job but the FERC approval to util=
ize additional horsepower could take 6 - 9 months.  Other considerations to=
 review would be the air quality permit for the increase in horsepower, and=
 potential environmental clearances to do construction.  Let me know what y=
ou think about this suggestion.  Please feel free to call.
