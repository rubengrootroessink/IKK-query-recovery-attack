Great.
Let's meet in Teb's office at 9.
If you bing the standard expansion contract, we can decide which provisions to put in the tariff.
Then, you and I can go through the individual contracts.
Based on our review we can decide if there are any deviations and if any are material.

Staci, 

Teb has a very narrow window to meet with us on material deviations. 
Can you meet from 9 to 10 tomorrow?
