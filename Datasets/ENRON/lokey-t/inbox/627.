A number of you have had a lot of concern about Deferred Compensation that Enron has ceased to pay as a result of the bankruptcy.  Maybe we have some good news -- there is a "rumor" out today, in the event you have not heard, from a reliable source, that the Deferred Compensation creditors have moved up from 4th place to a little higher because of the amount of money involved.  I have heard that Mike Moran has been placed on the "Creditors Committee."  I believe that Mike Moran and Dan Ryser were working together.  Part of the rumor indicates that the largest creditors -- primarily the banks -- may buy out the Deferred Compensation creditors "to avoid having to deal with them."  That is about all that I have heard at this time, except that the "buyout" may not be 100%.
