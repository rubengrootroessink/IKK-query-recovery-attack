Attached is a revised draft Complaint against SoCalGas incorporating comments that I received.  I am faxing the attachments to you separately.  Excuse the numbering and spacing if it is not perfect.  Pls. comment asap.  Once we finalize the documents, we can discuss how we share this with SoCalGas.  Thanks, Maria
