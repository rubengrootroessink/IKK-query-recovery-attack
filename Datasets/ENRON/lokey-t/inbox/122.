The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) Walk is scheduled to take place on Sunday, October 28, at Greenspoint Mall. 

Approximately 35 children are diagnosed with diabetes each day.  Even with insulin, this disease results in a drastic reduction in quality of life and shortens the average life span by 15 years.  

Enron has been the #1 walk team for the Texas Gulf Coast for 6 years in a row, and we need walkers and volunteers to help us continue this tradition.  

EGS' goal this year is to raise $20,000, and we need your help. To participate, donate $5 to any JDRF Team Captain and receive a shoe to be displayed at the Big E Cafe on Friday, October 26.  A donation of $25 entitles you to a t-shirt and a shoe at the Big E Cafe. All donations will be matched by Enron.

Business unit pledge totals can be viewed on the JDRF race track located in the lobby.
