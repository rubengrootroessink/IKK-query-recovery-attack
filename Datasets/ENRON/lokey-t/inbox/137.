THE GREAT WALL --An American Dream !!!!!...

 Three guys, a Canadian, Osama bin Ladin and
 Uncle Sam are out walking together one day.
 They come across a lantern and a Genie pops out
 of it.

"I will give each of you each one wish, that's three
 wishes total," says the Genie.
 
 The Canadian says, "I am a farmer, my dad was a
 farmer, and my son will also farm. I want the land to
 be forever fertile in Canada."
 
With a blink of the Genie's eye, 'POOF' the land in Canada was
forever made fertile for farming.
 
 
 Osama bin Ladin was amazed, so he said, "I want a wall around
 Afghanistan, so that no infidels, Jews or Americans can come into
our precious state."
 
 Again, with a blink of the Genie's eye, 'POOF' there was a huge
 wall around Afghanistan.
 
 
 "Uncle Sam" (A former civil engineer), asks,
 "I'm very curious. Please tell me more about this wall."
  The Genie explains, "Well, it's about 15,000 feet high,
  500 feet thick and completely surrounds the country;
  nothing can get in or out---virtually impenetrable."
 
 "Uncle Sam" says, "Fill it with water."
