I think once this movie comes out we need to have a Hilary
Smith day!  A ticker-tape parade (with a detour down
Avondale!), autograph-signing, red-carpet, etc.  There's no
reason for us to take any further guff from Avondale on this
Hollywood movie star issue.  Clark Gable is not even alive
any more as far as I'm aware; at the very least he hasn't
made a popular film in some time.
