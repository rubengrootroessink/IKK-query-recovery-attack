I had also received the filing and likewise Susan (Scott) Lindberg had received one.  Susan's copy has been forwarded to Blair/Teb for regulatory review as well as being available in Houston for Marketing to review.  It's a bound document about 2 inches thick including the testimony.  Importantly it includes SoCal's proposal for receipt point capacity.  I've only read the transmittal letter thus far but will continue reviewing it for more detail.  

Steve, would you want to designate someone from Marketing to review key sections?  I would offer to let them know which areas or sections of the filing could use input from Marketing before we decide whether or not to comment on SoCal's proposal or to simply intervene at this time, monitor progress and provide input later in the proceeding if necessary. 

Other comments?  gh
