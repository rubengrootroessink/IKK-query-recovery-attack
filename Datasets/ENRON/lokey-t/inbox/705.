When my new house was having its 'settling in' pains and I got a leak in the
roof, I used a guy named Gum? Garcia.  He did a great job, for me and for
several friends.  He was also interviewed by the Chronicle one year when
they did an article on Hot (summertime) Jobs in Houston.   In the Heights
(713) 862-2734, or try the phone book.

PS:  He even put a shingle on my birdhouse.  Doncha love a guy with a sense
of humor?
