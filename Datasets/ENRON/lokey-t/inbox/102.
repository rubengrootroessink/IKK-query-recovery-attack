I'll have Richard Wendt pick up your surplus laptop.

The price on a new Compaq M700 1ghz laptop with 284mb memory and case is approx $1800
For a Docking Station its about $200 more

Send me an email when you are ready to order.

Thanks, Karon

The FGT/TW rates and certificates department no longer has a way of dialing in remotely because of outdated equipment.  Robert Barker tells me that the standard minimum on laptops that would enable us to do so is a 266 MHz processor with at least 128 megs of RAM.  Could you please provide an estimate of the costs involved to purchase such a laptop?  In addition, how long does it generally take to receive the equipment once it is ordered?

Also, I have an IBM ThinkPad that can be returned if you will let me know who handles surplus equipment.

Thank you for your assistance.
