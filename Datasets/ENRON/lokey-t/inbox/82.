Sorry to have taken your time with this. Please thank Zelda again for me for 
helping out and returning my telephone call, which I asked her to do. Hope it 
was okay for her to make the long-distance call here. I'm so pleased to have 
Mother riding to Texas with me, especially since I've been so tired lately. 

Thanks again.
Love,
Sandy
