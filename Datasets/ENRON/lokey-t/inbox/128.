ETS State Government Report:

California

I00-11-002  Adequacy of SoCal System.  Since no parties challenged TW's tes=
timony supporting SoCal's receipt point capacity proposal in Opening Commen=
ts, Transwestern did not file Reply Comments last week.  Most comments by i=
ntervenors focused on other issues such as their open season mechanism, cur=
tailment, backbone transmission capacity addition planning, slack capacity =
and barriers to new interstate pipeline service.

A01-09-024  On Sept. 21, 2001, SoCalGas filed its Biennial Cost Allocation =
Proceeding (BCAP) application.  The purpose of the filing is to revise rate=
s to reflect the updated allocation among customers of non-gas commodity co=
sts of service effective January 1, 2003.  In addition to the required rate=
 revisions, SoCal requested authority to revise and simplify various tariff=
s and to implement several new programs.  Of interest is the proposal for a=
llocation of firm receipt point capacity into their system.  Other  proposa=
ls address procedures for open seasons to expand the backbone system, an in=
-kind fuel charge for transportation and an expansion of the unbundled stor=
age program including gas loaning services.  The application, testimony and=
 exhibits have been distributed to Marketing, Legal and Regulatory for revi=
ew.  Interventions will be due at the time of the pre-hearing conference wh=
ich was proposed by SoCal to be held in late October.

Infrastructure Report.  The California Energy Commission approved its Natur=
al Gas Infrastructure Issues Report on a 4-0 vote after several months of d=
iscussion and revisions to various drafts.  Most recently certain commenter=
s encouraged the CEC to include an assessment of El Paso's impact on prices=
 through market power and manipulation.  Instead the CEC report references =
the FERC proceedings addressing this issue and the fact that the CPUC which=
 filed the complaint will represent the interests of California ratepayers.=
  Numerous factors are addressed as contributing toward the high prices exp=
erienced during the last heating season, these included insufficient receip=
t point takeaway capacity within California, insufficient capacity on the E=
l Paso pipeline system, high demand for gas fired electric generation, low =
storage levels and extremely dry weather conditions which led to lower hydr=
oelectric output.  Recommendations included encouraging additional in-state=
 gas production, re-evaluate design criteria to expand intrastate systems, =
encourage the creation of new and independent storage facilities and revise=
 curtailment rules.

New Mexico

01-121-PL  The rescheduled Sept 12th public meeting on the NMPRC's Safety N=
