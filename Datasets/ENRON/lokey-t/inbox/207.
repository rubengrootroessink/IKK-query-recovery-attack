In order for your system to be updated with any system changes (such as for virus updates) that are made when you login, we recommend that you logoff at the end of each day.  Please remember to leave your CPU powered on!!!!!

There are two ways to logoff your workstation:

First:
Click Ctrl, Alt and the Del keys at the same time
Select Logoff from the options 
You will be prompted to confirm your intention to Logoff

Or, second:
Click Start
Select Shut Down
Click on the Drop Down Arrow and select Log Off (youruserid will be displayed)


Please keep in mind there will be some extra time added to this process if you have made changes to anything stored in your two offline forlders: My Documents and Application Data.

If you have any questions, please feel free to give us a call.
