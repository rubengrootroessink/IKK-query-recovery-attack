FYI


My office followed up on the various emails about this location.  We had a
series of responses.  Below are the definitive ones.

Annise Parker




Marlene,

Our investigator found major unpermitted remodeling and changes in
occupancy. Issued a stop work order today subject to citations. There will
be follow up and plans will be required.

Code Enforcement






Sheila,

We could not find any permits for the work at the above address.  Could you
check your system and see if they have any permits.  They may need parking
but, I can't address the parking until I see the plans.

Marlene Gafrick, Planning Department
