So glad you could come to the party--it would never seem the same
without you.

Debbie called the next day and left a message saying she had planned to
come but had thought it was New Year's Eve.  She never mentioned that I
had called her twice (at least) to ask when I could drop by a small
gift.  I was hoping she would come but not too surprised.  Please stay
in touch with her.

The Mexican star lantern is really wonderful--you were absolutely
right--definitely my kind of thing!  It's been lighted every day since
Don brought it home.  I love telling folks it's my night light, although
I really don't leave it on all night.  Maybe one day I'll decide where
to hang it up.  For now, it's in a fine place.  I really can't thank you
enough for spying it and buying it for me.  It's sort of like the
whirl-a-gig--something you don't know you can't live without until you
see it!

Thanks for the leads on computer help.  I definitely need someone who
makes house calls--to my office.  do these folks do that?
