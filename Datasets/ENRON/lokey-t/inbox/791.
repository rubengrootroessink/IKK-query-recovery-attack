Bill and Rob,

Attached is the latest stab at the referenced LOI.  Please call Kim or myself with any questions about what we were trying to achieve with the new language.

Also, if you are able to get your comments back to us by around 2:00, we'll route this to the rest of the internal "check points" before we present it to Kinder Morgan.

Thanks,

Mark
