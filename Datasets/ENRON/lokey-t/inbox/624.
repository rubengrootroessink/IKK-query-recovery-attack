Hi, Teb:
Here's my flight info.:
Leave Manchester airport on Thurs., Dec. 20, at 5:50 p.m. on Continental Flt. 
1445.
Stop in Cleveland--no change--and arrive Houston Intercontinental at 10:33 
p.m.

Leave Houston on Sun., Dec. 30, at 10:50 a.m. on Continental Flt. 644; arrive 
Cleveland at 2:32; change planes, leave at 3:30 on Flt. 1226, and arrive 
Manchester 5:03 p.m.

If you have any kind of conflict whatsoever, please let me know as I'm sure 
Pres would be able to pick me up Thurs. and take me on Sunday. I don't want 
this to interfere with anything going on in your life.

Ann Demeranville said to give you a big hug and wish you a happy holiday, in 
spite of all you are going through at Enron.

Love,
Sandy
