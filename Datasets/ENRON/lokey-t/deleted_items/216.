Hi there.  I'm new to the neighborhood, and I want to be involved.  I'm 
interested in Citizen's Patrol so sign me up!  I'm not sure how much I'll be 
able to do, due to my work schedule, but I'll do what I can.

Good friends are like stars....you don't always
see them, but you know they are always there.

Don't frown, you never know who
is falling in love with your smile.
