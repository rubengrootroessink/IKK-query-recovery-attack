Neartown neighbors,

This thing w/ Reliant-HL&P (R-H) is not over. Right now I'm talking w/ various officeholders w/ this approach....if R-H has permits and plan approval from all levels of government, how come you didn't tell me/us about what they were going to do in Montrose?

What is this 10 year plan I keep hearing about? What do you know about the plan and how does that impact Montrose?

Expecing answers next week and a response to staging a meeting w/ all of us and R-H to respond to our direct questions. 

Also asked DDanberg to do w/ R-H what she did w/ TX Dept of Transportation and the SW Freeway and the bridges. Bring us all together in one room. Not w/ p.r. people but w/ decision makers.

Need one, maybe two committed volunteers to comunicate w/ R-H and the politicians. Someone(s) I can appoint to a task force on this issue. Maybe a liitle face time, mostly lots of phone and fax work. Need well mannered persistance to contrast my crabby aggression. That's worked w/ other issues.

Call, e-mail to discuss if you would like to step up to this.

Thanks
