I have to admit, this is the first e-mail I have sent to the group, but do
find it necessary to be educated and sometimes enjoy reading about what is
going on in the neighborhood around us.
 
I felt it my duty to alert the association about an ATTEMPTED break in
that occurred at our home.  We have an attached storage room in the back
of our home, with a separate entrance.  It has old paint, some wood, a cat
carrier and a few items of NO value!!  It seems a few night ago someone,
armed with a cordless drill, and obviously nothing better to do, tried to
no avail to drill all the way through the door and break the lock to get
what was inside.  Fortunately our lock and the door are stronger and they
did not get in, but we did not hear them either.

We have filed a police report and tried to block access to the rear of our
house, however, it still steams us!  We are now more aware of our home as
well as the neighborhood.  Hope this helps!!!
