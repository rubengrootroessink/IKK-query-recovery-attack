Yes, he is required to put any existing sidewalks back in place (obviously,
with new ones, if he tears them out).  He's not required to put sidewalks in
where there were none.

Since he's planted grass instead, I suggest you call the City--there's a new
director of Public Works, but Amy has some contact names down there.  If they
don't push the issue, then call your new Council Member, Ada Edwards, because
she's eager to make herself helpful to Montrose.

Good luck.
