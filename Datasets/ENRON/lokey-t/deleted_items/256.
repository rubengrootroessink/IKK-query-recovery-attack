Hi Teb!

Classmates now has more than 27 million members -- with more 
being added every day. And sure, that's great and everything, 
but what does this mean to you? More old friends to find, 
that's what! Find out who's new now!

Pay it forward
If you've received a Classmates Hi Note before, you know 
how exciting that can be. Take a moment today to find an 
old friend. And if you become a Gold member, you can make 
someone's day extra special with a Hi Note email-just to 
say hi!
http://www.classmates.com/go/e/74243541/CC031102BC/CM19

And with all these new members, there are even more chances 
that you could find anyone -- not just friends from schools 
or the military. Try searching for old friends from anywhere! 
Just type in their name and see what happens!

Wendy Dickerman
Director of Member Care
