The following items were discussed in this week's ETS and Corporate Change Control and will be implemented TODAY...

At 1:00 p.m., the Win2000 team migrated the reverse lookup zones from the OTS domain to Corp.  This change included the gas control segment of 155.251.16.0.  During this change the DNS name space for OTS was also migrated to the Corporate domain.  No impact is expected.  However, if you feel you are experiencing problems that may be related to DNS name resolution, please contact Mary Vollmer at 713-709-9414.
