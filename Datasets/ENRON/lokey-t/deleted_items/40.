> When the amended Chapter 42, Development Ordinance, was passed in March,
> 1999, the biggest change made was to divide the City into two parts,
> suburban-everything outside Loop 610 and urban-everything inside Loop 610.
> To create an urban area that was "denser" than the suburban area, the
> ordinance provided for smaller setbacks, smaller lot sizes and less
> compensating open space in the urban area.
>
> For those urban neighborhoods who did not have deed restrictions or whose
> deed restrictions did not address front setbacks, the amended Chapter 42
> provide the Special Building Line Requirement Area (Section 42-163, SBLRA)
> as help.  The SBLRA allows neighborhoods to petition the City to maintain
> their prevailing front setbacks.

> This proposed Prevailing Lot Size amendment to Chapter 42 will work
