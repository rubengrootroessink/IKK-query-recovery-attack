Neartown neighbors,

Turn on Channel 11 news this Saturday afternoon and watch me blither about Reliant-HL&P's installation of the big utility poles.

Thanks to whomever sent the e-mails about the Reliant press release to Ch.11. This resulted in a walk along Peden looking at the poles in front of residences. 

On this beautiful weekend nobody NOBODY is home. Knocked on doors along Peden, nobody answers. Called all around throughout leadership, nobody answers. It was short notice and I would have perferred someone else on camera.

So if you are at home to catch this e-mail in time, let's see how it plays this afternoon, if Ch.11 decides to run the story at all.
Never know.

Thanks,

Ed Gonzales
