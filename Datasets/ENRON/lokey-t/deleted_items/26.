Maybe the City can be called out to fix ALL of the curbs and gutters on 
Welch, when they do the street patch on Welch.  It is a tragedy that COH 
never does a job well.  At least I have some satisfaction that Annise's 
crumbling curb wasn't replaced either.  Oh, forgive me, perhaps it wasn't 
really in need of repair!

Sarcastically yours, Scott
