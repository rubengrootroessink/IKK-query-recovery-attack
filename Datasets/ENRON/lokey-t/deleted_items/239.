Thanks for the additional information - that's way more succinct and clear
than anything I found.
I'm not sure TWRC will test for which kind of distemper it is, if the
treatment is the same.  They're an underfunded non-profit - is there any
other kind? - and I doubt they'll worrry about identifying the exact bug
involved.
I think maybe if your dog's distemper shots are up to date, you're ok. 

A roommate's cat caught FIV from a hostile stray on Fargo - unfortunately I
think we have to assume unknown critters could be a threat to household
pets.  I do foster strays sometimes, but I don't let them near my own cats
until I get clearance from my vet.
