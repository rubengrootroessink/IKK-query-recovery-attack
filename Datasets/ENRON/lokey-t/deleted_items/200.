The 'bar' sort that many people have above their bathroom vanities.  These
have beveled mirror fronts, with chrome accents.  They could be a very
contempory look, or, in another setting, they would appear quite elegant.

Two are 18" long                $15 each

and one is 36" long              $20

Take all three for $45
