Greetings all.  There was a pretty good turn-out last night but far
short of the 20+ I was expecting.  There were quite a few no-shows.  As
I said earlier, we need at least 20 to show the HPD that we are
serious.  Last night we had 14 attendees.

So I need to know:

if  you  still interested in doing this.

if someone would like to be in charge of the citizens' patrol.

If you weren't able to attend last night but are still motivated, how do
you suggest we transmit the introductory information to you?  A lot of
people did not make it and it will be impossible to find a day that's
convenient to everyone's schedule.  Maybe one of you who couldn't attend
the meeting would like to be responsible for providing the introductory
information to the others who couldn't be there but are still
interested.  This stuff is very basic and simple but you have to sign a
sheet showing you've heard it in order to get the training from HPD.

Last call, ya'll.  If it doesn't fly this time, maybe later.

Cheers,

Jaimie Evans
