He can net imbalances together by "booking out" the imbalance of one entity with the imbalance of the other entity.  In other words,  do a book-out with himself.  This can be done without adding the single point as a division to an existing divisional contract.

Importance:	High


	I spoke with Chris Snyder this morning and his request is to add New Smyrna as a 4th Division to his existing 3 Divisions in order to have one Balancing Entity  vs.. Two Balancing Entities so he can net imbalances together. He is not looking for section 11 rights and he knows the New Smyrna lateral is constrained and he can not move any additional volumes there. Chris right now will have to deal with Two Balancing Entities and this is what he is trying to avoid. He will do what ever it takes on his end that we require/request. Please take another look with the one reason (Balancing) in mind. Give me your feedback. Thanks... John.
