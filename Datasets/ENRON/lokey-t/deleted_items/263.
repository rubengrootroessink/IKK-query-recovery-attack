They've Got Mail
Although we love to be surprised, sometimes it's even more 
fun to do the surprising yourself. First you need to become 
a Classmates Gold member, then find an old friend and send 
them a Hi Note. You're certain to make them smile!

Above the Rim
Spring means a lot of things to a lot of people. For us, it 
just wouldn't be the same without some serious college hoop 
action. Check it out now in our Classmates March Mania 
Spectacular!

We hope you enjoy your Spring. And with the warm weather 
approaching, this is the time to start thinking about a 
reunion. Take a moment to see if your reunion has been 
planned yet.
