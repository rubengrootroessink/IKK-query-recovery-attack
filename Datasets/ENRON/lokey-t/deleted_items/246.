Ed,
Great job at actually getting something (almost) in writing from HL&P!

The big poles are just not suitable for neighborhood use, simply too big.  I
am, therefore, selfishly relieved that they are not continuing along my
street.  With all the townhome development, plus these mega-poles, what else
can be done to destroy the traditional appearance of our area?  Maybe
they'll put an environmentally sensitive second deck 20' above Montrose to
bypass the ailing downtown highways?

The attached explanation does however beg the question why there's one of
the new pole holes been dug on the NE corner of Peden and Montrose, when the
line runs down the west side of Montrose Blvd. and then west on Peden.

Neartown neighbors,

The attachment is a response to my information request concerning Reliant -
HL&P's installation of the big poles. Conversations after my letter's
receipt moved in the direction of possible community meetings where R-H
would explain what they were doing and answer our many questions.

Last Tuesday R-H informed me that since the installation project would be
completed by the end of this month, that the attachment would be sufficient
for their communication purposes. A meeting with us was not necessary.

The R-H spokesperson readily admitted that there had been no attempts to
obtain community imput/feedback prior the new pole installation.

I'm disappointed and frustrated. I need your thoughts on how to proceed.

Read the attachment and tell me what you think should happen next.

Thanks
