The following item was presented in this week's corporate change control....
Jan. 3	
	From 6:00 - 6:30 p.m., the Corporate server team will move cluster notes nahou-us06 and nahou-us07.  These two nodes will be evicted out of 		there respective clusters and recreated as an application cluster.  No impact is expected.
Jan. 4
		From 3:00 - 4:00 p.m., the Win2000 team will decommission DFS Server NAHOUTRD to replace existing the DFS NAHOU cluster marked for 		Netco.  No impact to ETS users is expected.
Jan. 5
		From 2:00 - 3:00 p.m., the Corporate server team will split the sysAdmiral Fault Tolerance Databases and Master Services on 				NAHOU-BPMS01P and NAHOU-BPMSFT01P. The NAHOU-BPMS01P Database/Master will be used for Estate Scheduling needs and 			NAHOU-BPMSFT01P will be used for Netco Scheduling Needs. The servers may have to be rebooted during this change but no impact to the 		sysAdmiral application is expected.  After the environments are split there will be no more replication between the two servers or Fault Jan. 		Tolerance.  
Jan. 7		
		From 7:00 a.m. through 1/11 at 5:00 p.m., Facilities will perform the annual maintenance on the rooftop chillers.  The chillers will be taken 		down one at a time during the maintenance.  No impact to ETS is expected.
