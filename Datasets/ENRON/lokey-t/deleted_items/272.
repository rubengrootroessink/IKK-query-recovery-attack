YIKES Joe!!

I was just perusing old e-mails, trying to find a letter from a friend in
France, and, uh, whoops,,, I just came across the note from you to please
announce in the newsletter your direction of the production of The Mikado.

Uh-oh... I'm so sorry.  The newsletter would have been good exposure for
you.  I can't believe I missed it... I usually try to read the EMCA e-mails
several times so I don't leave anything out.

Well, I goofed!  So sorry.

Now that the event is over, how about if you write a synopsis of how things
went, and I'll make SURE that it gets printed in the next newsletter?
