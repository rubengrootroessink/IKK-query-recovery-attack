Scott, Nathalie, Gayle and everyone else involved:

 

This was a great contribution to the project.  We need community memories: someone like you and Candalaria Moreno with good memories and someone with a big hard disk to archive our e-mails.  I discovered a couple of other contributing factors: Mrs. Moreno or someone at 405 Bomar must have had a problem going from their driveway into a slightly elevated Bomar, so they pored a concrete ramp to connect their driveway and the street.  It forms a dam so they put a four inch pipe in the cement. It's too small and is probably filled with debris.  And the 1916 cover for the storm sewer drain at Willard and Morgan has caved in so it now blocks the drain instead of covering it.


I made a little map (based on the HCAD map) which I'm attaching, hoping that it doesn't take too long to download.  Let me know if you see something that should be added or substracted before I take it to Ada Edwards' office.
