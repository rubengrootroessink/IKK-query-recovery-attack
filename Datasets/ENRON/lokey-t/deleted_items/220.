If anyone has seen our dog, Meesha, please call us at 713-522-3644.  
She is brindled (black and brown), about 40 pounds (she's chubby) and 
very friendly - unless you are the mailman.  

She responds to her name or anything else for that matter as long as 
you have food in your hands.  She does have her collar with tags for 
Neartown Vet Clinic.

I accidently left the gate open today and she left.  I found our 
other dog, Zoey, around Morgan and Bomar but there was no sign of the 
little one.

Please, if you have seen her let us know.  We are very upset about 
this.  We lost one of our cats to cancer this past month and losing 
another would be too hard.

Thanks,

Lorraine, Frank and Tyler
