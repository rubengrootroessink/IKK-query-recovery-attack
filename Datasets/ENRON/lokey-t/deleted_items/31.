**********************

Community members,
 
Today (Thursday) the Planning Commission held a public hearing on the Prevailing Lot Size Amendment.  
 
The meeting started at 2:30pm and many, many, many agenda items later, just after 6pm(!), it was our turn to step up & speak in favor of the amendment. Talk we did, and I believe we had a good impact. 
 
Thanks to last year's NTA president & Chapter 42 expert, Jack Rose and past east Montrose president, Carmen Druke for being there for NTA.
 
Also there was Jane Cahill & Billie Mercer from Old Sixth Ward, Theo Fabio and Evalyn Krudy for University Place and BOCA and the president of Southampton CA (didn't get his name). 
 
There were folks there, too, from the Heights, making an altogether well rounded representation of the vitality of the inner-loop. 
 
There's no decision yet from the commission and we'll be watching for that. It was a long grim wait, but it what you have do to gain those little bits that add up to self determination for our neighborhoods and protection and preservation of our communities.
 
Thanks to everyone that make the effort today.
 
Ed Gonzales
Neartown Association, 2001 president
