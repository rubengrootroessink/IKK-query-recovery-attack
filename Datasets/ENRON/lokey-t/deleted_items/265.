Neartown Leaders & Neighbors,

Today, Thursday, March 21st, is the NTA Leadership meeting at 7pm, Cherryhurst Park Community Center, 1700 Missouri.

An open meeting to anyone that wants to watch your community leaders come together to deal w/ neighborhood issues. Please be sure to have someone there from your neighborhood, community or association.

With the CIP early March meetings behind us, NTA turns its attention to your neighborhoods concerns and issues.

A... 1..February minutes.
B....2.. Old Business...CIP, Quick Overview. March 29th is the CIP request deadline. Questions or concerns, call me at 7-616-0800 or Bridget in Council Member Ada's office, 7-247-2001. 
B...3..Keep Houston Beautiful presentation resulting in several groups, including Park Civic, that will pick up litter in their neighborhoods this Saturday as part of as city-wide event. 
B.. 4...CM Annise Parker needs 4 or 5 volunteers for this sat morning for Westheimer & montrose. Call Stephanie in her office at 7-247-2014, to tell her you want to participate. Free lunch & T-shirt, too!

C..1.Task Force Formation: Half-way houses in the neighborhoods. Lesson learned last year...must use the preceding year to a state legislative year to prepare documentation, background and language for any bills expected to be seriously considered in the legislative year. task force to do the above in reference to prohibiting, limiting and/or regulating the placement of all types of half-way houses, facilities for addiction and chemical dependency, and sites for treatment programs in Montrose. State senator Ellis, State representatives Danberg, Coleman and Farrar see the need and without our help, it will not happen.  

C.. 2..Task Force Formation: Meet Your Elected Official Event 2003. To avoid last minute hassles, to maximize the potential of this important event and to add real depth and fun to it, a few volunteers are needed to make this happen next January. I'll continue to do what I do best, get the notables there and the restaurants to donate food.  

D...Crime in the 'hood. What's it like in your area? Have heard really scary things from Park Civic and other areas. East Montrose is responding by organizing a Citizens on Patrol. Why the increase in crime?  What can we do about this w/ HPD?

E...Neartown Little League Opening Game Day Parade & Ceremony this Saturday at Dunlavy Park

F..Civic club/association reports....(the most interesting part of the meeting, I think)

G...Reliant-HL&P update.

What else?  Go home.


Thanks
