Note to EMCA residents:
 
This "follow-up" on the HPD Sweep in our area should be VERY informative and relevant.  Please make time to attend.

Community Leaders & Members,
 
Neartown's monthly meeting is next Tuesday night (10-23-01) at 7pm. Cherryhurst Park Community Center, 1700 Missouri.
 
1....This big agenda item is the return of HPD's command officers to give us an after-action report on the enhanced police presence & foot patrols of September. We'll hear about what citations were made, the number of arrests and HPD's impact on area crime. 
 
We'll also learn what we can do to keep this momentum going.
 
This is also your opportunity to address HPD on any crime or safety issue in your neighborhood.
 
2....Neartown-Montrose Super Neighborhood Council. It's official since last week and the non-residential members will be introduced at the meeting. [Montrose Business Alliance, Neartown Little league, Pride Committee, Montrose Community Church, Neartown Community Partnership & Greater Hou. Gay-Lesbian Chamber of Commerce]
 
3...This is the last meeting before the November 6th election and I'm inviting all candidates for all offices to be there for an introduction. It's an open invitation to all 27 candidates, but with event scheduling getting tighter just before 11-6, I do not expect more than two or three to show up.
 
We'll also talk about the 11-27 Garage Sale and the Prevailing Lot Size Amendment.  Please be there to represent your neighborhood, your community and take this opportunity to talk w/ HPD.
 
Thanks
