To add to the list, there was another break-in this morning (mid-morning)
while the owners were out to breakfast.  Someone used a crowbar to pry open
the garage and a lawn mower and several other things were taken.  The address
is in the 2300 block of Mason, but the access was from a driveway in the 200
block of Fargo.  The incident has been reported to the police.

Not too long after that, two officers came by my house to follow up on some
complaints that I turned in last week.  The urged me to tell everyone that
the more calls and complaints that are filed in our neighborhood, the more
justification they will have to bring more officers into the area to work the
problems.  They need the evidence to show that our problems are growing.  So
keep those phone calls and blue forms coming In!

If you need more forms, I have some (303 Fargo) and also you can get them at
the Storefront.  I will also bring them with me to the next meeting.
