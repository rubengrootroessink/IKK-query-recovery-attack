Hi Teb!

The ways you can find old friends at Classmates keep growing. 
From Kindergarten to College and even the Military, old pals 
are out there just waiting for you to find them. Come find 
out who!

and you can post your photos here for all your old friends

Missing a school or military affiliation?

Make sure that you're finding all the old friends you can. 
Register wherever you've gone to school or served in the 
military. After all, true friends are not always this easy 
to come by.
