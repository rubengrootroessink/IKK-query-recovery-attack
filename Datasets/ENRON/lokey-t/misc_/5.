What a kitty !!!!!!!


Subject:	Big Kitty

Read the story first and then check out the CAT. 
    
Rodger Degagne, a former employee with AECL in Chalk River, may be
embarking on a new career as Feline Breeder. Relaxing in his
spacious home on the shores of the Ottawa River, Mr. Degagne recalls how 15
years ago he befriended two stray young cats on the old AECL research facility
at Chalk River. The kittens had appeared in late summer and apparently had
gotten under a security fence around the old labs abandoned since the late
50's.  With the help of his tuna sandwich, Mr. Degagne was able to coax
the kitties close enough so that he could  pick them up. A self described
animal lover, he did not want to place the kittens in the local Humane
Society. In this largely rural area, cats of all stripes and ages largely
go unwanted and are humanely disposed of after a few days. Later that evening
his wife Louise and their two children, Nicole and Kelly came to a family decision
to keep the kittens which they named Lost and Found. When nature finally took
it's course, a litter of kittens was born 6 years later. One of the litter was
a big white female with a unique black markings on her side and tail. Something 
about the kitten captured the hearts of the family and while her siblings eventually
found homes elsewhere, Snowball stayed with the Degagne's. While Lost and Found are no
longer with us, their progeny live on.  In her 9 years Snowball's size has seemed to snowball.
Put simply, Snowball is no ordinary cat, she measures 69 inches from nose
to tail and weighs in at 87 Ibs.  She started out a big kitty and she just seemed 
to keep growing.  Chicken is her favorite. "Once I left a cooked chicken on the 
table that I was going to use for a boat picnic, an hour later the chicken was gone", Louise said. We knew that snowball wasn't your average cat when the neighbor's
German Shepherd ran yelping away from his first encounter with her. She
just isn't afraid of any animals.  After we found a half eaten raccoon out by
the garage, we decided that maybe Snowball should be kept fenced in. We soon discovered that while we can keep snowball in the yard, we couldn't keep raccoons from Snowball. At least it kept the food bills down. So what does a 87 pound cat eat? Snowball goes through about 3 lbs. of cat food a day, along with cooked chicken, supplemented with deer and
moose that Rodger hunts in the fall. So what do the Degagne's attribute Snowball's 
size to? Rodger says "Well, the vet thinks it could be her thyroid, but she isn't fat, she's just a real big cat. I think maybe her parents got into something at Chalk River
that they shouldn't have". (see photo of Snowball attached!)
