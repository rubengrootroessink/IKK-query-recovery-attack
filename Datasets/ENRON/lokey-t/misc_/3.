It's over!!!!!  It ended about 1:30 this afternoon.  Thank you for
remembering.  Mom and I went out for an early celebratory dinner.  I am
looking forward to my trips - and, believe it or not, returning to work
Have any plans been made yet to celebrate Christi's 25th?  Do you know when
her official anniversary date is?  I want to participate if I'm not too
late.  Should I email Steve?  Also, Teb, while I'm thinking about it . . .
does Estalee need to be notified that I'm returning for sure in June?
Thanks again for everything.

Debbie

I think I recall you saying that your last final was today (Thursday) -
I know your Policy final was Monday.  If you're through -
CONGRATULATIONS - if not - GET BACK TO WORK.  I know you will be busy
getting ready for your trips.  Have a great time and send us a postcard.
Everyone sends their congratulations and best wishes and can't wait for
you to get back.

Have fun and we'll see you June 4, bright and early.

Take care,
Teb
