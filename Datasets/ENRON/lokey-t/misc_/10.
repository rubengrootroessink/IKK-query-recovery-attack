David, only sending to you...because you'll "get" them.   Linda <:)


     Mahatma Gandhi, as you know, walked barefoot most of the time, which
     produced an impressive set of calluses on his feet.  He also ate very little,
     which made him rather frail.  He was also a spiritual leader of the Hindu variety and as such
     was required to eat certain mystic spices believed to contain spiritual powers.  With his
     odd diet, he suffered from chronic bad breath. This made him what: A super
     calloused fragile mystic plagued with halitosis..

     A woman had twins, and gave them up for adoption.  One of them went to
     a family in Egypt
     and was named Amahl.  The other went to a family in Spain; they named
     him Juan.  Years
     later,Juan sent a picture of himself to his mother.  Upon receiving
     the picture, she told
     her husband that she wished she also had a picture of Amahl.  Her
     husband responded, "But
     they are twins......if you've seen Juan, you've seen Amahl."

     A group of chess enthusiasts checked into a hotel and were standing in
     the lobby
     discussing their recent tournament victories.  After about an hour,
     the manager came out
     of the office and asked them to disperse.  "But why?" they asked, as
     they moved off.
     "Because," he said,"I can't stand chess nuts boasting in an open
     foyer."

     Did you hear about the Buddhist who refused his dentist's Novocain
     during root canal work?
     ..........He wanted to transcend dental medication..

     A three-legged dog walked into a saloon in the Old West.  He slid up
     to the bar and
     announced, ........"I'm looking for the man who shot my paw."
