     As many of you know, I have been working at the Enron Body Shop since the fall of 1991.  Way back then, I was fresh out of college with lots of ideas and no experience.  But working here has given me more experiences than I could ever have imagined!  I truly believe that it has helped make me the strong, confident, successful woman I am today.  As Enron has high expectations of you, its' employees, so did you have high expectations for me at the Body Shop.  For these past 10 years, I have strived to meet and surpass these expectations.  I'll never forget those first classes I taught here when my group exercise teaching skills still needed a little "fine-tuning"? okay, a lot!    As I watched some of you pick up your benches and stomp away long before class was over, I vowed to one day be one of the best instructors you have ever had.  In this, and many other ways, you have inspired me to greater heights in my career and life.  
     Now it is time for me to seek new challenges.  Last Thursday, I accepted a position as manager of a fitness center of my own.  My last day at the Enron Body Shop will be Thursday February 1st.  Although I am looking forward to the changes and new challenges, I will always look back at the Body Shop with so many fond memories and good feelings.  But most of all, I will miss you, my favorite members!  And although you have all been "challenging' and? well? downright demanding at times , I am so proud to have had the pleasure of knowing and working with each and every one of you.  You are all such impressive individuals with a dedication to fitness that I do so admire.  Stay healthy and live long happy lives!  I feel so satisfied knowing that the programs and expertise I am leaving behind will help you all to do so.  
May God's richest blessings fall upon you today and every day!
Sincerely,
Ann Patrice Mora
