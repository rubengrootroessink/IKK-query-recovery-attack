Okay, once again, I know this is corny, but I think that it is so corny until it is also funny!!!  -- Constance

Two robins are perched on a telephone wire when one spots a whole bunch of tasty, juicy worms wriggling temptingly in the grass below. They swoop down and hungrily begin eating their fill. After stuffing themselves, they feel so sleepy and full that they can't manage to fly back up to the wire. One robin suggests that they lay in the sun for a bit while they digest their meal. Well, sure enough, a cat comes along and gobbles up both of them.

The cat licks her lips and says, "Man, do I love baskin' robins!"
