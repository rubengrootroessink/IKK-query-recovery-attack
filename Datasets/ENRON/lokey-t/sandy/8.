Hi, Teb:
Here's Ann's response to the Big Kitty email. Steve may be right, but I don't
think so because the cat does look like it's being held end to end. Or does
it???

I'm going to have to make a big decision--give up office here in Depot Square
or rent out apt. What do you think is the better choice?

Love,
Sandy

Hi Sandy,

Steve thinks this is tinkering via Adobe Photoshop. Thinks the guy doesn't
have the posture he would have to hold an object that size.....if it is
true, it is pretty amazing!

Looking forward to seeing you Friday. Am thinking that if I end up working I
will still come up Friday night since it stays light so late. So plan to see
me one way or the other. Had a GREAT weekend in Maine. Really love that
place!! Ann
