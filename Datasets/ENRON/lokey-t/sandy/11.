I opened it! How cute!! Thank you. Wish I could get a copy and hang it in
front of me for inspiration.

It's gorgeous here again today. Everyone is feeling spring-feverish but we
know that April is the cruelest month. The temp is mild, the sky is bright
blue with a thin veil of clouds here and there--and the ground is piled high
with snow. A New England dichotomy. Even the cats were happy to go out this
morning. There's a definite scent and feeling in the air, which both Molly
and Dancer were noticing. What confuses Molly, I'm sure, is that it can be
sooooo mild but she still has to scale these cold, white mounds of snow cone
material. Only patches of bare ground where I shoveled a path from front door
to driveway.

Hope all is well. Any car possibilities? Mother said the bluebonnets have
already gone by. Can that be true? I didn't think the wildflowers bloomed
until late to early April. Oh well, I won't have time to ride through the
countryside anyway.

See you in a few days. I'll bring maple syrple with me. Anything else? A
bucket of snow?

Love,
Sandy
