Happy weekend!

You know, I haven't even heard alot of these

Now that we have a Texan in the White House, we need to be aware of the language
code:

1. The engine's runnin' but ain't nobody driving = Not overly-intelligent
2. As welcome as a skunk at a lawn party =(self-explanatory)
3. Tighter than bark on a tree = Not very generous
4. Big hat, no cattle = All talk and no action
5. We've howdied but we ain't shook = We've made a brief acquaintance,  but not
been formally introduced
6. He thinks the sun come up just to hear him crow = He has a pretty high
opinion of himself
7. She's got tongue enough for 10 rows of teeth = That woman can talk
8. It's so dry the trees are bribin' the dogs = We really could use a little
rain around here
9. Just because a chicken has wings doesn't mean it can fly = Appearances can be
deceptive.
10. This ain't my first rodeo = I've been around awhile.
11. He looks like the dog's been keepin' him under the porch = Not the most
handsome of men
12. They ate supper before they said grace = Living in sin
13. Time to paint your butt white and run with the antelope = Stop arguing and
do as you're told
14. As full of wind as a corn-eating horse = Rather prone to hot air
15. You can put your boots in the oven, but that don't make em' biscuits = You
can say whatever you want about something, but that doesn't change what it is.
