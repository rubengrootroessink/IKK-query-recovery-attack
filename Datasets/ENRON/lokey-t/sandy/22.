Hi, Tebby:
I got to my office earlier than usual today so am playing with email. It's
absolutely gorgeous: brilliant blue sky and cold but not frigid. In fact, I
went home at noontime so I could put the cats out. They wouldn't budge this
morning but I couldn't blame them--it was only 10 degrees! But it must be
near 30 now.

Am feeling good and have been. It's funny though how hard it is to get up in
the mornings now. Used to be that I couldn't get myself to stay there, but
now I'm actually having to set the alarm so I'll not lose track of the time
and still be there come 8:00! Still wake up frequently, look at the clock,
sometimes toss a bit and sometimes just drift right off for another hour or
so, and repeat the same routine. I think part of my reluctance to emerge is
because it's so warm and comfortable under the covers and so chilly outside
of them. For the first time in a long time, Molly slept on my bed last night,
and stayed pretty close by, curled up in the covers. I have two down
comforters on the bed plus Daddy's Army blanket, and two other thin wool
blankets. I get my exercise trying to lift the weight of those many layers
each time I turn over!

May get some fresh snow tomorrow, which I'd love, although I do need to
remember to rake the roof. I haven't done it these last couple of snows so
the iced edge along the north side of the house is getting higher. I have
broken through it, however, and now pour hot water out the bathroom window
and down the roof to keep the channel open. That's my "high" tech way of
dealing with things.

Really enjoyed having pizza and wine with Betsy and John last night. They are
so nice. I know you'd like them and they you. Although they've lived in NYC
for years, he's originally from the Midwest, I believe, and I've forgotten
where Betsy is from--Florida maybe, or perhaps New York. She's Greek, very
attractive, petite, and really sharp but you wouldn't know it at first. John
is huge--6'5", large-bodied but not what you'd call fat; just a little extra
around his middle. Unfortunately, he smokes so I worry a bit about his
health, but he knows what he's doing. Anyway, I'm enjoying meeting new people
and they seem to know EVERYONE. They're always introducing me to someone or
suggesting places to do business or restaurants to go to, etc.

I'm anxious to get my computer set up at home, but am reluctant to until I
get the living room ceiling and bathroom floor fixed. Called the
contractor/carpenter who worked on the rafter plate and rafter ends to come
out and give me an estimate for what it would cost to take down living room
ceiling and pull up bathroom floor. Each time I sit on the commode, it seems
to be lower!! I'd hate to wind up on the big blue couch next time I pee!!
Although I guess there could be worse places to land.

Tom Rush is performing at P'boro Players on April 6 so I've already called
the Folk Music Society to volunteer to make cookies that night. Am waiting to
hear back. What a treat that would be to get free ticket to hear him. I'm
sure lots of people are trying the same thing, but I'll buy a ticket if I
have to. CSB also wants me to attend one of their conferences in Manchester,
NH, that weekend so I know I won't be in Texas at that time--unless there's
an emergency or Daddy decides to move to Treemont then.

Clare's new job involves telecommuting, not telemarketing as I said before.
Sometimes she's at the house and sometimes she isn't. She asked me today
about health insurance because this company doesn't provide medical coverage;
all I could suggest was joining the Author's Guild, which is where I had
coverage before I went on your plan.

Well, I should try to do some work before the entire afternoon gets by me.
Hope your week hasn't been too draining and that you'll have an enjoyable
weekend.

Much love,
Sandy
