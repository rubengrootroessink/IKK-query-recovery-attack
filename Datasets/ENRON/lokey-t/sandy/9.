Hi, Tebby:
Here's something I enjoyed doing. Thought you might also--especially at the
end of a Friday--assuming the day is winding down for you.
Much love,
Sandy

The Dalai Lama said to read it and see if it works for you and he will
tell
you your personality.
Very interesting.
Just four questions and the answers will surprise you ... Do not cheat
by looking up the answers. The mind is like
a parachute; it works best when it is opened. This is fun to do
have to follow the instructions closely.


MAKE A WISH BEFORE BEGINNING THE TEST!

A Warning: Answer the questions as you go along ... There are only four
questions; and if you see them all before finishing, you will not have
honest results. Go down the page slowly and do each exercise as
you scroll. Do not look ahead. Get pencil and paper to write your
answers
as you go along. You will need them at the end.

This is an honest questionnaire, which will tell you a lot about your
true
self
..



















Put the following 5 animals in the order of your preference:

a. Cow b. Tiger c. Sheep d. Horse e. Pig



















Write one word that describes each one of the following:

a. Dog b. Cat c. Rat d. Coffee e. Sea



















Think of someone (who also knows you and is important to you) whom you
can
relate to the following colors. (Please do not repeat your answer twice.

Name
just one person for each color.):

a. Yellow
b. Orange
c. Red
d. White
e. Green



















Finally, write down your favorite number; and your favorite day of the
week.



















Finished? Please be sure that your answers are what you REALLY feel ...



















Last chance ...



















Look at the interpretations below (but first, before continuing, repeat
your
wish).



















This will define your priorities in your life:

Cow signifies CAREER
Tiger Signifies PRIDE
Sheep Signifies LOVE
Horse Signifies FAMILY
Pig Signifies MONEY

Your description of dog implies your own personality.
Your description of cat implies the personality of your partner.
Your description of rat implies the personality of your enemies.
Your description of coffee is how you interpret sex.
Your description of the Sea implies your own life.

Yellow: Someone you will never forget
Orange: Someone you consider your true friend
Red: Someone that you really love
White: Your twin soul
Green: Someone that you will remember for the rest of your life




You have to send this message to as many persons as your favorite
number;
and your wish will come true on the day that you selected as your
favorite
day.

This is what the Dalai Lama has said about the Millennium -- just take a

few seconds to read it and think. Do not put away this message, the
mantra
will come out from
your hands in the next 96 hours. You will have a very pleasant surprise.

This
is true, even if you are not superstitious.

SEND THIS E-MAIL MANTRA TO AT LEAST FIVE PERSONS, AND YOUR LIFE WILL
IMPROVE:
0-4 persons - Your life will improve slightly; 5-9 persons - Your life
will
improve to your liking; 9-14 persons - You will have at least 5
surprises
in the next three weeks; 15 or more persons - Your life will improve
drastically
and all that you have always dreamed, will take shape.

If, at any time, you do not receive the smile you were expecting, be
generous and give that person a smile. Because no one has as much
necessity
of a
smile than the person that does not know how to smile at others.

Love, Jill
