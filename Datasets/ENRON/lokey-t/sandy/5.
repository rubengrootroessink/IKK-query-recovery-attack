Hi, Teb:
Su's son, Bill, sent this to me. Thought you'd appreciate it. Good to talk
with you today. My schedule is so swamped with deadlines I'm feeling
overwhelmed. Had a terrific time with Su, Laura, and Mother, and wish I could
get Mother with someone else while I'm having to work. She's been reading a
lot, though, which helps. Sitting in my office now, where I have an a.c.
We're going to Peterborough Players tonight for opening night of play titled
"Fully Committed." It's a one-person show and supposed to be hilarious. Will
be a nice diversion. Trying to get a lot accomplished beforehand, so I'd
better get back to work. Good luck with kitties. They are lucky you found
them!
Love,
Sandy
