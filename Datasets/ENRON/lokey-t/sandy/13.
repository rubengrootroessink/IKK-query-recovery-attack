Hi, Tebby:
I'm at home, preparing to be snowed in. Went to Crystal Springs this morning
and left around 12:45; stopped in at Depot Square ofc. but didn't stay long.
Picked up two pieces of reduced pizza at 12 Pine (did I tell you the owners
sold it to someone from NY?), bought a few items at Maggie's, and then drove
home. Peterborough was almost deserted because of the impending storm.

Lorraine called me at the Depot Square office to say that work had been
called off for tomorrow so I don't even have to think about trying to get
plowed/snow-blowed(?) out until Wednesday. It has been snowing steadily for
most of the day but not huge accumulation yet--few inches. But, predictions
are for continual snowfall and strong winds tonight. I've filled some large
containers with water, have brought firewood in and even put some in
basement, although I really should get more before it gets dark as I'm not
sure this will last until Wednesday. But I can always shovel my way to the
woodpile, which is dwindling faster than I expected. Still have plenty to get
me through the season.

I feel very secure and able to deal with any emergencies/inconveniences that
might arise like power outage, etc. It will be interesting to see how the
house handles the winds now that my wind-break to northwest has been reduced
quite a bit. The positive side to having had so many trees cut down
surrounding the place is that I might not be as vulnerable to falling timber!

Both cats are in, of course, sleeping through it all. I doubt that even
Dancer will want to get out in this tonight--not that I'd let him. Looks like
Clare may have gone to Mass. so she won't have to travel in bad weather. Keep
hearing references to the Blizzard of '78. I was in New Ipswich during that
one, but N.H. faired quite well compared to other places like Connecticut,
where people lost power for weeks, I believe. Can't recall what happened here
but it must not have been too bad.

I'm forwarding some info. about SDE/CSB that bodes well for employees. I'm
not able to take advantage of any of this right now, but after a year (next
Oct.), I should qualify for participating in their retirement program.
Highlights is a good company to be associated with.

One other thing I keep forgetting to ask about is the money I received from
you in 2000. How do I handle that? As earnings that will be taxed?

Have had CNN on since I got home and have been listening to reports about
Cheney's heart concerns and the shooting at high school in Santee, CA, where
2 people were killed and 13 wounded. A ninth grader, who I believe is in
custody, did the shooting. Will this ever stop? I feel more pangs of
uneasiness listening to news of that kind while being by myself than I do
facing a winter storm alone.

Let me know when late Valentine arrives. You might want to keep it in your
office. I bought one for me, too, and have it at CSB. That's all I'll say as
I don't want to give away the surprise. Again, it isn't anything big or
serious--just some fun.

Better throw a few more logs into the stove. Lines may be tied up tonight so
we may not be able to talk. If not, sleep well and have pleasant dreams.

Love,
Sandy
