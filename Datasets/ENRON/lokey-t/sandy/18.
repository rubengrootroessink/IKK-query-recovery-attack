Hi, Teb:
I just received your envelope with your check and two copies of divorce
decree. Thank you for this. I wonder why I'm getting two copies, though.
Shouldn't we both be getting an  original? I have an original for when Henry
and I divorced and Wade, too. It isn't a big deal, I'm just curious.

Kenneth and Mia left about 2 hours ago. We had lunch in town here, introduced
them to my New York office friends, and then they headed for the airport in
Manchester, giving themselves loads of time--just as you would. I have been
feeling heavy-hearted for a couple of days and almost tearful when I got up
this morning, knowing that they were leaving. It surprises me a bit, and
reminds me of the many times I would say good-bye to Mommy and Mother and
Daddy and know that they were sad to see me go. Guess I'm just getting
old--or reaching the same period in life that they were/are in.

They'll come back, I'm sure, as often as it appeals to them, but in the
meantime, I will miss them. They are so bright and upbeat and
interesting--and interested in so many things. And I enjoyed reminiscing with
Kenneth, and hearing about some of his childhood memories. Once again, I am
reminded of similar times when I was younger and visiting relatives and doing
much the same thing. Haven't noticed this before; now I'm experiencing it
from both an older and younger perspective--as aunt to Kenneth and Mia; as
child to Daddy and Mother. Interesting...

Lots to do so I'd better close. Again, I'm not worried about these
decrees--just curious.

Love,
Sandy
