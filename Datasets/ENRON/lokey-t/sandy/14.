I know I'm starting my 54th year. I just meant I'd rather not look at it that
way!! None of these numbers make sense to me anyway; I could just as easily
be 45 or 35 or 85. I'll never be able to reconcile the reality with the ...
spirituality? Mentality? Physicality???
You know what I mean.

Love,
S.
