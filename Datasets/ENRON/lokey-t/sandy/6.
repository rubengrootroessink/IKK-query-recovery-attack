Hi, Tebby:
Thought I'd send a reminder about getting number/etc. for Teas nursery owner
from woman who knows him--when it's convenient.

Had a message from Daddy which he left at 10:00 a.m yesterday, saying he was
getting ready to take Dorothy to the emergency room as her tremors were so
bad. He said he was calling Pres, too, but wouldn't call Sheryl. Made me
think she might be in really bad shape, so I called him immediately after I
got home and found his message. They were back at home and she was sleeping.
Decided not to stay at hospital as all her signs were normal. Anyway, during
our conversation he said he wished I were there, and I wish I were too as I
know I could provide moral support if nothing more. That got me to thinking
about trying to fly down after all in time for Anthony's and Candice's
graduations. Don't know if it will work but am going to check flights. The
biggest hang-up could be work on the house. Guess I could postpone it until I
get back. I would come for only a week--maybe June 2 or 3 through June 8 or 9
or 10. Just tossing it out as a possibility as I'd love to see both "kids"
graduate, and also give Daddy a little help. Maybe Mother would fly back with
me. She's waiting to have surgery on both hands, though, so...

I did call Macy's in Manchester about mattresses and theirs are MUCH cheaper
than Mattress Discounters. Queen size like the one you and I had in Houston
is $1600 at M.D. but $1439 at Macy's, and if I wait until 4th of July, I
could get it during their sale for $1295!! So I'm heading over there now to
try it out and if there's time, will swing by M.D. in Nashua, just to see if
they do feel the same. Could also go there tomorrow, as I need to be at
neighbor's for dinner at 6:30.

Talk with you later, or tomorrow.

Love,
Sandy
