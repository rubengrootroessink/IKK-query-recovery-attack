Teb, 

Elizabeth, Nancy, Mary, and Jim would like to discuss with you the segmentation identifier.  Tennessee says that they do not use this for identifying a segmented release from a releasing shipper.   And, I believe that the GISB defintion defines it as something else.  We'll bring the definition with us.
