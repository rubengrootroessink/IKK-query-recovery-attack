Amy & Julie - I have sold my house and will be moving to an apt. near Kirby & W. Alabama before the end of the month.  I  am in the process of packing up my house and have several other obligations this weekend so I will not be able to arrange for the newsletter distribution.  I believe I gave Amy a list of the distributors - Deanna will not be able to continue and Martha and Pat have indicated they would like some relief also.  On the positive side, Lorraine(?) in the 300 block of Welch (with the new baby) has said she would like to help.  

I can't remember the new officers so could you all arrange for a transition to a new distributor?  

Thanks,

Teb
