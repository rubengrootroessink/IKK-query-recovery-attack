All,

We are still working on all the details of the proposed interconnect with Questar Southern Trails in the Blanco Hub and will send you a copy soon for your review.  Since the interconnect is fully reimbursable, Questar is proposing to pay us according to the attached payment schedule vs. paying all of it up front.  

Please take a look at this attached schedule and provide me you comments.  If we allow them to pay "along the way" I am interested in making sure it at least matches the timing of our cash outlay of building the interconnect.  The total estimate of $702,000 includes the tax gross up, which may or may not be applicable, so each of these amount may be reduced by the tax amount.


Does anyone have any concerns with the timing of the payment schedule?  

Thanks, Kim.

I have attached the payment schedule for the Interconnect & Operating Agreement.  We thought you should have an electronic copy as well.  We look forward to talking with you on Friday.  Thanks.
