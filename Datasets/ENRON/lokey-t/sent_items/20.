Subject: First military move


A platoon of crack Special Forces soldiers have taken the first steps of
reprisal after the incidents in America.

The heroic force, composed of A&M corps graduates, have broken into the dog
kennel area of the A&M Veterinary Science Building and captured all the
Afghans.

They reported light casualties.
