To EPLF and its sympathizers:   Unless the toaster is returned immediately,=
 SADIST will commence an escalating series of  actions designed to bring al=
l such terrorists to their knees.  We realize there may be some collateral =
damage, and for this we are truly sorry.  But we must end toaster terror fo=
rever.  Beginning at 0900 hours on 10 January 2002, SADIST will commence th=
e following series of actions (each subsequent action will commence 2 hours=
 after the preceeding sanction):
1. All deliveries of new business cards will be suspended
2. Napkins and paper towels will be removed from the kitchens
3. Post-it notes will be confiscated from all locations
4. Paper towels will be removed from all bathrooms
5. Toilet paper will be removed from all bathrooms ( Enron stock certificat=
es will be issued for humanitarian reasons)

If the toaster still has not been returned, SADIST will be forced to remove=
 all COFFEE FILTERS from the building, including the Energizer and Plaza Ja=
va.  Do not doubt our will to use this ultimate weapon, after all we are SA=
DIST. =20

Subject:=09RE: Paper Situation

It has come to the attention of the Dedicated Information Technology Progra=
mmers Addicted to Caffeine that we are somehow getting the short end of the=
 stick in these negotiations.  We are generally used to this, but this is t=
he last straw!  Being an often overlooked faction in these wars, we are how=
ever, very powerful.  Unless you provide us with the affricated drinks we r=
equire to survive, we will sabotage these negotiations.  We start by asking=
 the following questions:  What are your requirements for paper?  Have you =
documented these requirements.  What is the cost justification for ordering=
 this paper?  What printers are you using?  Does IT have to support these p=
rinters?  That will cost extra money.  What were the different requirements=
 surrounding your use of the toaster?  Do you toast bread and waffles?  Wha=
t other uses do you have for the toaster?  Anything not specifically includ=
ed in your written requirements will be rejected as a scope enhancement and=
 will cost more money or cause a delay in the return of your toaster.

To avoid further delays in the negotiations, please deliver bribes in 6-pac=
ks of 24-ounce bottles of the following:  Dr. Pepper, Mountain Dew, RC Cola=
, Jolt.  These payments should be left in the kitchen refrigerator so that =
they will be cold when we drink them in the morning.

Remember, paper without a working printer is the wrong print queue.  A toas=
ter without power is a metal storage box.  We have the power and will use i=

We are willing to sit at the table and negotiate.  SADIST has pushed us to =
the brink!  We have infiltrated the SADIST camp and know are in possession =
of a toaster, AND blender.  We have joined sides with EPLF to demand that o=
ur paper supply stays in high demand.  If our demands are not met by the en=
d of today, we will be forced to sign over all our Enron stock options to y=
our organization.  This will cause your organization to implode!!=20

We will never negotiate with toaster terrorists!  We will eat raw bread for=
ever rather than turn over a single sheet of paper - or even a single chad =
- to those who would resort to such extortion.  If we give in now, we will =
only encourage such acts in the future.  First our microwaves, then our fil=
tered water dispenser, then our refrigerators will become targets of these =
evil doers.  Rather, we will hunt down those responsible for this dastardly=
 act, and bring them to justice or justice to them.  We will also go after =
any department supporting the evil doers as well as anyone who partakes of =
bread (or Eggos or pop tarts) toasted in the purloined appliance! =20

EPLF -- you're TOAST!!!!!

We have your toaster!!!  You'll get it back when our demands are met.
Leave 4 boxes of 8 1/2 x 11 paper (no damn 3 hole punch paper either)
under the TV on the west end of the 39th floor and you'll be toasting
away within a few hours.  This isn't from Craig; we've hacked into his
email...
