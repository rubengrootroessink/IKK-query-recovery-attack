Please pay the  $2154.18 invoice from Platts and charge it to the balancing tools account.  This expense was incurred because of changes to our cash out pricing recently approved by the FERC.  FGT's customers felt that Gas Daily's indices were more representative of the pricing into FGT's system than the weekly indices published in Natural Gas Week and we had to incur additional expense to secure Platt's permission to post certain data on our web site.
