I got your telephone and e-mail.  I think 3% is the right amount. Gotta run - have a great day! Talk to you tonite.  Love,  Teb

Morning, Teb:
I just found the message you left yesterday. Am sending you this email to
see if you can get it. Did you get my telephone message this morning about
retirement plan here at SDE? They put in 3% so I think I'll just have to let
that be all that's deducted from my paycheck for the time being. If you
think this is definitely a mistake, let me know. Please reply if you get
this email.
Love,

Sandy
