Teb,
The footnote belongs on the line for Receipt Point Area: San Juan.  It should read as follows:

	SAN JUAN: (a) (3) (4) 

I suppose this is another tariff clean-up item.

On Sheet 5A.03 of the TW tariff there is a footnote that does not have a reference to the upper part of the page, is the footnote an error, or has it been dropped by mistake.  Thanks.
