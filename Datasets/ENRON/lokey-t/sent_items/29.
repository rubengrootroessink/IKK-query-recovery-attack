Subject:	Chairman's Award Nomination for Alice Johnson



I am submitting Alice Johnson for the Chairman's Award and would like your input.  I think the leadership she has shown in support of the UNCF Walkathon demonstrates those core values that are the measurements for the award.   Attached is the Chairman's Award form.  Please complete as much of the form as you can in support of Alice, and return it to me by the end of this week.  Leonard Daily and myself (and any one else who wants to participate) will compile the responses into one form and submit it.

Thanks for your support. << File: nomination_form.doc >>
