We must be able at all times to fulfill our firm obligations through Station 6.  We do not have the option of reducing our certificated capacity without filing an abandonment at the FERC in which we would have to demonstrate that the abandonment would not impair our abilities to meet our firm obligations.

Talked to Buzz about the situation... It seems we "might" not have the option to leave the other 2 units alone due to Firm obligations.  Operationally we could probably handle using just one compressor.  However, we need 3 units fulfil our FT committments.

Teb,
Per our phone message, could you check on the tariff requirements for this issue.  In other words, do we have the option of shutting down 2 compressors @ CS6?
