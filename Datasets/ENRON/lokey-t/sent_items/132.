Let's try Tuesday at 10:00 am.  I will set things up on this end and then contact you, Rachel and Teb with the phone number to dial into.

Can we set up a phone conference sometime next Tuesday.
Rachel and I have some questions.
Is 10:00 am a good time?
If not, how about 2:00 pm?

FYI -  NBPL and MGT are going to proceed with implementing the PAL transactions posting under the Interruptible Agreements Informational Postings as indicated in Geneva Patterson's e-mail dated February 1 and are targeting April 1 as the first day.

Thanks,

Bambi
