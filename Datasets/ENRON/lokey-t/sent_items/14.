This is a mate to another one that was sent around a couple of weeks ago, which said: Note to the Taliban: Hand over Osama Bin Laden or we will take all your women and send them to college. 
 
 

>> As for what to do with Osama bin Laden: Killing him will only create a martyr. Holding him prisoner will inspire his comrades to take hostages to demand his release.

Therefore, I suggest we do neither.

 
Let the Special Forces, Seals or whatever, covertly capture him, fly him to an undisclosed hospital and have surgeons quickly perform a complete sex change operation.  Then return her to Afghanistan to live as a woman under the Taliban.
