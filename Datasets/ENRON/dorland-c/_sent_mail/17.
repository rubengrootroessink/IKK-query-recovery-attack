Rod,

What do you think of the Canadian bank stocks? Relative to their US counterparts they seem cheap. I know that the discount is due regulation (no take overs or mergers) but in a 4% interest rate environment a 4% dividend yield looks pretty attractive. Not to mention they continue to crank out earnings quarter after quarter.
