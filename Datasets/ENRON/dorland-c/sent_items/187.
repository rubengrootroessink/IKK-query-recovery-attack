Hello All 
 
Per the General announcement that went out a couple weeks ago I had requested all Time off (Flex days and Vacation) and Sick days for all employees since June 1st (or your start date).  The information is required to determine your carry forward allocation.  Without an e-mail indicating your time off I will not be able to update the new system and no carry forward dates  will be processed.  Even if you have not taken time off I need to know.  Also if you have any future time off requested and approved please forward those dates.  
 
Thanks in advance for your cooperation and assistance...
 
Send those e-mails...

Thank-you,

Michelle Wells
