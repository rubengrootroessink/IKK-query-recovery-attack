Sorry it took so long to get back to you. My boss has been out this week and I am doing both our jobs. Lots of fun. I'm glad you had a good time on your trip.I need a vacation. Are you over your cold yet? It is funny how many people I know have colds in the middle of July. I didn't do anything exciting of the 4th. I watched the NY fireworks on TV. We were on a big gong show weekend the weekend before in Conroe so I needed rest. Better get back but I'll write back later.

Chris

Hey Chris!!  My trip was great.  We had soooo much fun but it flew by.  I
have a good video you will have to watch.  I got back to work last Thursday
and was thrown immediately into a deal that was closing on Friday and to top
it off I wasn't feeling well once I got back here.  I think someone on the
plane was sick and gave me a cold.  So I rested over the weekend and then I
have had a complete week from hell this week.  I have been meaning to touch
base with you!  I didn't even do anything for the 4th of July.  Did you
watch the fireworks??  I was hoping to get out of here early but I don't
think I am going to have that much luck.  I am in town doggie sitting right
now.  I may actually be moving on the 15th of the month back inside the
loop.  What do you have going on for the weekend?  I am hoping I don't have
to come up here.

Crystal,

How was your trip? I was in Lake Conroe last weekend for a work retreat.
We had a great time but I think Austin would have been a better
destination. Susposed to be 95-100 next week but feel like 110 with the
humidity. Can't wait. Take it easy.

Chris
