Mike,

What's going on? It is hot as shit down here. I had to get a new # because that crazy cougar was stalking me. It is 713-665-8145. Just kidding my old phone company went belly up. I am really looking forward to Matt and Jen's wedding. I bought a new lampshade to wear. Be sure to get Matt all fucked up on the stag. Talk to you later.

Chris
