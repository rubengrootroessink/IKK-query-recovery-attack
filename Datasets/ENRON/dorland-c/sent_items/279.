Hi, Chris,

I am just wondering if you had received my fax from last week regarding the
Power of Attorney form (Form 2848).

Friday, Oct. 5th will be my last day at PwC, and I just wanted to follow-up
with you on this matter before I leave.  If you do not get a chance to fax
the form back to me before then, or if you have any other concerns, please
contact Judy Perdomo @ (403) 509-7470 after next Friday and she will be
happy to assist you.

Best regards,

Vicki Meszaros
