Chris - In order that we are able to set up the transfer of files in an orderly fashion and, more importantly,  maintain security protections for certain directories (e.g. legal) I believe a better approach is to replicate our existing directory tree structure under a new I:/Newco/ directory.  At this level we can then break things out into the required subfolders (e.g. accounting, trading, legal, ...). 

In this regard we have set up the I:/Newco/ directory and started to create subfolders. I ask everyone who has put information in the I:/trading/newco directory to move it to  I:/Newco/ under their applicable subdirectory (which may need to be created).  I apologize that this is a hassle for those who have already transfered files.

If you have any concerns please let me know.

Regards
Chris

Hi everyone!

Once again I find myself being tasked by Geof Storey. Houston has requested that we make lists of all applications that we use and also that we consolidate all of the files (models and data) that are critical to our business (I don't think MP3's count) into one directory on the network. This is so that these items can be included in the proposed deal with newco. The Calgary Trading group has set up a directory on I:/trading/newco and I think if each group did the same that would be great. Each group should probably have one person in charge of the directory so there isn't any overlap. Call me with any ?'s/

Thanx 

Chris
