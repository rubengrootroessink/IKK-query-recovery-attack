Brad,

Back in Canada and up to my eye balls in work already. I don't think I'll be travelling for a while.Can you change my mailing address with Mackenzie to my new address please. I think they have my Houston address on some stuff and mom and dad's address on others. We'll have to get together the next time I am in Red Deer.

Thanx

Chris
