Brad,

I need to top up my RRSP for 2001. My contribution limit from my tax return for 2000 is $10881. I have contributed about $5500 through Enron and Enron has contributed $3200 to my pension plan. Am I correct to assume that I can contribute about $2000. The part I wasn't sure about was the pension contributions. Let me know and I will send you a check.

Chris

PS I am going to Vancouver next weekend to look at buying a sweet Porsche
