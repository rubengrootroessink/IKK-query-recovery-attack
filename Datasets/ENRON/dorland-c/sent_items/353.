Ben, here is where Chris is sitting.  Please drop off the envelope.  If uncertain on where the West Desk is on 32 ask Ina.

I had asked that it be delivered to you by hand before I left Thursday.  Apparently, they tried a few times but I asked Ben to only hand it to you.  We will bring it down today.
