You not working today? I called like 3 times. Did you hear about Jaimie Hawley's litttle brother? She must be a mess. I haven't got anything for Mom's b-day yet. Any great ideas? Did she get her flowers for Mother's day? Father's day is coming up June 17. Maybe we should give Dad that Arnold Palmer flag for father's day. Later...
