Linda,

I found your email address on the internet so disregard the message I left on your cell. The following properties are the type of place I have in mind. I thought that these would give you a better idea the general concept I am looking for. I am starting to think that a townhouse / infill is a better way to go as opposed to an apartement style condo. I look forward to meeting you on Friday. Below are some MLS #'s of properties that interested me and my contact # in Red Deer / Calary.

Thanx

Chris Dorland

I have also heard a lot of good things about Garrison Woods and would like to check that development out.
