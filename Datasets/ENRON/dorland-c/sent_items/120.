   Please be aware that remote connectivity into the  Enron network has
   changed, IPASS is no longer available. Remote Connectivity into Enron
   may be obtained by using the eConnect solution.  Authorization to use
   eConnect may be requested via the eRequest system (you will find a link
   to eRequest on http://itcentral.enron.com).

   Email is accessible from any computer with internet connectivity by
   logging into Outlook Web Access http:\\mail.enron.com with your NT login
   ID and password. Accessing OWA does not require an eConnect connection.

   Please direct all questions or concerns to the Resolution Center at
   713-853-1411
   ETS customers should direct inquiries to the ETS Solution Center at
   713-345-4745

   We appreciate your cooperation in advance
