Hi Chris,

I don't doubt that things have been crazy for you with everything going on
in the US...

I checked the inventory and there are two black Limited units left in
stock - both with tinted windows.

Give me a shoutif you want me to order one in for you or if you have any
questions.

Take care,
Dwayne
