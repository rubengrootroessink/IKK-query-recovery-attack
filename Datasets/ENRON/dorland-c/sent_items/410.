I started with Enron May 1, 1997. I would like to know all options and restricted stock I have received since then.

Thanx 

Chris

Absolutely.  When is you term date here in the USA so I can use this date to run the calculation?

Also, here is the information you requested

401k

When you return to Canada, you can either roll over your 401k to qualified IRA or you can request a distribution from Northern Trust. If you choose to receive the distribution, you will be taxed 20% Federal and then 10% penalty.  Northern Trust @ 800-316-7526

The Cash Balance Plan

If you are vested (at least 5 years with the company) you would be eligilbe for a distribution.  If you go to the HR Web page,
click on Benefits, A New Look For  Benefits, Pension Plan.  Then you will need to type in your ss# and pin  (which is the last four digits of your ss#)  It will lead you to a place where you could see how to calculate this figure.  You can request a distribution by calling x37979  then press Option 2 Cash  Balance Plan.
