Grant,

Who is your contact at Zargon? We have a discrepency between tagg and the confirm on the term of a deal and I need to talk to the marketing contact to figure out what is correct. We sold them a cal 01 crude put (according to the confirm) but the system has it continuing until feb 02.

Thanx Chris
