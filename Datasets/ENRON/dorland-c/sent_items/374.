      Don't forget pink fuzzy dice and chain steering wheel and red
   interior
      lights. Chicks are going to love it. I'm going to get a chick with a
      python
      wrapped around her painted on the side and get those tires that stick
      out 6
      inches from the wheel wells with gold plated rims. SWEET! The funny
      thing
      is that in some neighborhoods in Houston (predominately latin) that
      would
      be a killer ride.

            Listen to this shit. If I want to move my car back to Canada I
         (Enron)
            would have to pay $2000 USD to move it plus 6.1% of KBB value
   in
         import
            duty plus 7% GST plus $200 excise tax plus about $400 in
   permits.
         Looks
            like I am looking for a new car as well.
