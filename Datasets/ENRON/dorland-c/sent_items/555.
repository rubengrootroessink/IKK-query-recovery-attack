To sleep.....I bet the next time you have a couple drinks and no talent is in sight you'll be giving her a call.  Hottie from picture has a large E and blow problem - had to split - too much for this hayseed from RD.  Matt's stag is on Aug long.  I think you told me you weren't going to make it but you are coming to the wedding, right?  I'm just trying to plan how many dudes for golf.

I had to put the cougar to sleep. Too annoying for words. What happened to 
the hot from the picture?

   not a whole lot new - except I went back to banging that broad from the 
   office....I know, I'm weak.  I hadn't seen her for about a month, then I 
   saw her in the office - she got tanned!  I buckled.  Still playing with 
   Cougar?

   I slept (was passed out) through the whole thing. My car is on the 4th 
   floor of the parkade so luckily it was fine. I love the MTV movie 
   awards. 
   Shannon Elizabeth rules. Halle Berry naked in Swordfish. Can't wait. 
   What's 
   new with you?

      Holy shite! 
      A little wet down there apparently...Did your car get flooded out in 
   the 
      parkade? 
      Mike. 
      PS. 
      Did you see Nadia from American Pie on the MTV Video awards?  Wow.
