Good morning Chris:
 
Thank you for using AUTONET.CA to obtain  information on the 2001 Toyota 4Runner Limited.  Due to very limited  availability, please inform me of a particular color choice you desire.   There is currently zero availability in Calgary and I would have to bring one in  for you if possible.  Your email indicated a lease timeframe of within the  next week.  I look forward to helping you further.  Please contact me  directly at the email address or phone numbers listed below for further  assistance.  Thank you.
