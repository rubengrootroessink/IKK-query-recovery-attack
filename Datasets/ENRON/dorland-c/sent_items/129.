I provided that level of detail for calgary trading and marketing. I haven't seen the file Richard Mckeel created so I wouldn't know what is in it. Seems like we have about 3 different people working on the same project. So my answer is I don't know.

Chris:

I've looked over the spreadsheet that Richard McKeel compiled, and noticed that there was not a detailed listing of every file in the set.  Please advise if we still need to get to this level of detail.

Thanks,
