Dad,

Just though I would let you know I talked to a Royal Bank credit specialist this morning and he will get back to me this afternoon. I also talked to Jordan and he is going to take call Linda and get going on the paper work. I think I am going to come back to Calgary September 6-7 to finalize everything. There is an Enron Canada offsite in Banff that weekend (Sept 7-9) that I should go to. Thanx again for all your help this weekend.

Chris
