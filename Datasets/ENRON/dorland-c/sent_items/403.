The colors that interest me most are black, silver, white, burgundy and champagne. I will be in Calgary on Sept. 6/7 and I will give you a call. Are you going to be in the office on those days?

Hi Chris,

I don't honestly know how long they will be available as our first 2002
arrived on Monday, so that would suggest that we aren't receiving any more
2001 models.  There are still several available, but if we didn't have your
2001 in stock, I would locate it at another dealer and bring it in for the
same price.

The next step might also be to give me your top choices for colours so I can
keep an eye out for you.

By the way, my work number is 730-4000, or toll-free 1-866-881-1888.

Take care,
Dwayne
