Matt,

Looking forward to the wedding. Unfortunately, I don't think I will be able to make it August long weekend but say high to Johnny and think of me. Take care and be sure to say hi to Jen.

Chris

Chris buddy!  How's it going?  I was chatting with Dan this morning and
I was able to track down your mailing address, so I can send you a
wedding invitation.  You're still M.C. right?  Just kidding, but it'll
be good to see you.  I hear everything's going good down there, speaking
for the rest of your buddies up north though, I'll be looking forward to
when that career path steers you back a little closer to home.  The
wedding is on August 18th(saturday), Mike & Nate are planning some golf,
camping and a little drinking as well on the August long weekend too if
you were planning on being back then as well, although that sounds like
a lot of travel.  Anyways, I suppose II'll see you at Sue and Dionne's
wedding?  Should be a good time.  Take it easy, Chris.

Matt Engelhardt
