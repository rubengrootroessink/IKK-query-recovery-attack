Sherry, 

This stuff looks perfect. I think I like the 385-B the best. I don't think I want the hutch though. So I guess I need 3 pieces (385-512,519,533). Can please order the pieces you don't have in stock. Also, this Thursday is just fine to deliver that stuff. Can you please remind the guys in the warehouse to pick up that loveseat at Carleton House. Be sure to let me know what it cost to fix that so I can bill the moving company. 

Thanx for all the help!

Chris

We have stock of the  385/522 double hutch, the 385/512 single pedestal desk, 385/513 double pedestal  desk, 385/514 computer desk, 385/530 cabinet, 385/551 30" bookcase, 385/552 48"  bookcase, and finally the 385/553 76" bookcase.  If we special order  any pieces they will take about 6 weeks to arrive.  Further to this, we  will deliver the La-z-boy suite, occassional tables, carpet, bed, etc. on  Thursday Oct 25. We are still waiting for your dining room suite to  arrive.  With any luck it will be here and we will deliver it as well. Any  concerns or questions regarding the above, please call.  Hoping  this info helps!!!!!
