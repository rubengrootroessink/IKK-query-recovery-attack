Hi Traci,

I hope you are having a good week. I am still a little tired from the weekend. Went out with my brother and a bunch of friends friday and saturday. Superbowl on sunday. Made for a very long monday. I have cooking class #2 tonight (soups and stocks). Should be a good time. Starting to get a little busier at work. Hopefully we will be up and trading sometime next week. I am coming to Red Deer this weekend. If you aren't busy we should do something on Saturday night. Have a great week and I will talk to you soon. 

Chris
