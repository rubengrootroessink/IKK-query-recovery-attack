Kim,
 
I just wanted to touch base with you and let you know my schedule. I am in the Houston office this week from Monday to Thursday but I will be in and out quite a bit meeting with movers and clearing up loose ends. If we need to get together before I go we should probably plan to do so Monday or Tuesday as I will be packing and moving much of Wednesday and Thursday. Let me know when you would like to get together. I am sitting at 3208b.
 
Thanx
 
Chris
