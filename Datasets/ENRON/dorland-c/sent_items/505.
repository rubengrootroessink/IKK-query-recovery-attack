Thanx for getting back to me so quickly. I am looking for something about 1300-1500 sq. feet with one bedroom plus den or 2 bedrooms. The price range I was thinking was $225-250 K. Hope that helps. I will give you a call later in the week .

Chris Dorland

Hi Chris!  Thank you for your Email.  My direct line is (403) 264-8086
or via pager at (403) 287-3880.  My web site should be updated with some
new listings within the next few days...maybe you can give me an idea to
some of your requirements (i.e. price range, size, bdrms, etc.)  Most
loft only have one bedroom area, but there are a few which have 2
bdrms.

I look forward to speaking with you and setting up an appointment for
when you are in town!

Regards,


Christina
