Ryan,

Sorry I haven't gotten back to you. As you can Imagine things around here have been a little nuts. Just wanted to drop you a line and say hi. Everything with me is fine and I have several options in front of me. The next few months will probably be pretty frustrating but I am confident everything will work out in the end. As far a snowboarding I'm not sure if I am going to be able to get out before christmas. I am coming to Red Deer on Saturday for the night and will pick up my board but the girl I am seeing is going home for XMas on the 20th and I think it would be bad if I made plans to going skiing next weekend. Hope all is good with you and I'll talk to you soon. Are you going to be in Red Deer this weekend? If so let me know and I will give you a call.

Chris

Chris,

What's your schedule like over the next few weekends...I'd like to go
snowboarding sometime soon, as the hills are open (not all runs though).

Later,
Ryan
