Hi Chris!  Hi Dan!
=20
Surprise, surprise, surprise!  I  just wanted to take a minute and express =
what a fan-tabulous video it was that  ran at the end of your mom's show th=
is year!  Your parts in it were  absolutely wonderful - came off beautifull=
y.  Was a teary ending to a L - O  - N - G show!  Of course, I put Mark on =
the spot immediately following the  show when we saw him and I said "OK Mar=
k, the camera is on you.....what great  things do you have to say about you=
r mom?"  He replied "Are you  serious?  You're not serious are you?"  To wh=
ich I said, "Yes, of  course I'm serious - you should have heard the great =
things Chris and Dan said  about their Mom!"  Well, he didn't let me down..=
...and then I had a few  more tears!  You guys did a great job with your pa=
rt of the video and I was  proud of you.
=20
Well, we are going through some major  changes here as I'm sure you know.  =
We took possession of our new "Red  Deer" home on June 1st and the first th=
ing we did was get Gunner in to install  hardwood flooring.  They just fini=
shed yesterday and it is awesome!   Originally there was hardwood in the fr=
ont entrance way, but we had that all  refinished to match the new stuff th=
at we had installed in the family room,  kitchen, and atrium.  I just love =
it!
=20
Today we meet the painter there and  choose colours and she will get starte=
d on Tuesday.  We'll have the whole  house painted pretty much and then we =
can start shuffling our "stuff" from here  to there.  It's quite overwhelmi=
ng moving everything from a barn, two  oversize double garages and this hou=
se into the city.  We had all the "farm  stuff" to sell and dispose of and =
that is pretty much all done now.  Dave's  tractor was his pool table fund =
and it just sold a week or so ago, so off to Red  Deer Billiards to purchas=
e the pool table.  He is having snooker rails put  on - I guess that's what=
 your folks have too, isn't it?  They tell me it's  harder to play and that=
 I should get practised up at home and then hit the bars,  challenge the un=
suspecting to a game of eight ball and then whoop their butts  (because I'd=
 be so incredibly good after practising on the snooker table).   Makes me l=
augh!  I'm pretty positive challenging anyone for a game would be  a joke o=
n my part, but hopefully I can get into "pool" mode and have fun with it  t=
oo.
=20
The yard at our new home is just  incredible compared to most Red Deer yard=
s.  The home is on a huge pie  shaped lot and has been landscaped beautiful=
ly, so we are quite pleased with  that.  And I LOVE the house.  It's really=
 very nice and I can hardly  wait for the whole move experience to be over =
and to be settled in there with  everything in it's place.  We overspent at=
 Sim's and that's going to be fun  receiving all that new furniture!
=20
Andrea, Michael and Braedon are doing  just fine.  They purchased a home in=
 Clearview Meadows and it's really very  nice!  Has a fenced yard with lots=
 of mature greenery and Braedon just  loves his new swing set and sand box.=
  Andrea & Michael are finding it  a real treat to be back in town and reli=
eves me that Andrea is so much closer to  the hospital.  She usually is wor=
king evening shifts and I always worried  about her travelling the highway =
so late at night, especially in the  winter.  They are expecting baby numbe=
r 2 and it would appear to be a girl  from the ultrasounds she's had so tha=
t is pretty exciting.  Miss Jordyn  Marie will be her name (they haven't de=
cided on a boy's name yet in the event  that Miss Jordyn Marie has a "Mr. W=
iggley" - but are pondering it).
=20
Mark, of course is a whole other  story.  That boy gives me a few new grey =
hairs on a regular basis.   He's no sooner apart from Nikki and "enter Alis=
on".  Alison is 18 years old  and very very quiet, so hard for us to get to=
 know her, but she seems quite nice  so that's a good thing.  (Not sitting =
around with a scowl on her face like  Nick usually did)  Mark and Alison ar=
e "in love" and are just ga-ga over  each other.  We are very nice to see h=
im so happy, although worry that it  all happened a bit soon.  But, what do=
 we know?  Mark has been having  trouble with his health and I'm somewhat c=
ertain it is stress related, however  he denies that.  He experiences such =
severe chest pains that he actually  passes out from the pain.  This has be=
en happening more frequently of late  and he had to leave the job he was on=
 in Fort St. John and return home to try to  get healthy before he moves to=
 Cold Lake on July 1st!  (That's the other  big change)  They've run EKG's =
(or ECG's) on him, taken blood, chest  X-Rays, etc. and results all came ba=
ck clear, so they are unable to determine  what is causing him his problems=
.  I guess he's dropped alot of weight and  is now underweight for his age =
and height.  The Dr. has now determined it  is a muscle related problem and=
 has him on muscle relaxants and apparently they  are helping somewhat, so =
hopefully it will be as easy as that.
=20
I'm sad to see him leaving for Cold Lake  again as it is so far away and we=
 won't get to see him much - but you guys know  all about that!  He, on the=
 other hand is quite excited to get away and get  a "new" start so to speak=
, once again.  Alison is moving up there with them  and they are pretty exc=
ited to set up their own home.  Right now Alison is  in Australia - a trip =
she has been planning and saving for for quite some time,  but she is missi=
ng Mark terribly and trying to come home early.
=20
We are going to the production "Chicago"  with your mom and dad next weeken=
d and I'm really looking forward to the  day.  Dave and I are planning a tr=
ip to Toronto Dan - just a quick 4 dayer  with another couple and I think w=
e've pretty much decided on August 16 - 19th,  but tickets haven't been pur=
chased yet.  We will go see the Lion King and I  want to drive out to Niaga=
ra Falls while we're there also.  Should be  fun.  Hard for us to focus on =
too much until we get this move  completed.  We have until August 1st befor=
e we actually give up possession  here on the farm and thank God for all th=
e time - we seem to be needing it and  it's just flying!
=20
Well boys, I better get off the computer  and get back to my packing.  Will=
 do some packing and then head into town  to run some errands before we hav=
e to meet the painter.  Take care you two  and once again - Great job with =
the video!
