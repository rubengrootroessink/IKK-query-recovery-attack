Hopefully I will be able to make it by then. I have to talk to Fletch and Presto but it makes sense for me to be there by then. I am coming to town on Thursday. I'll probably drop by the office on Friday.

I agree with that.  I actually have short august long Oct for some added kick (hopefully).

When are you getting up here?  I am supposed to plan for that offsite with Holst and Ermis on Sept 7th weekend.  Will you be able to make that???
