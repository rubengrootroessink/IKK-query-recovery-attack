Hey Chris,


     How are you doing? Sorry I haven't gotten back to you sooner regarding
Stickley, but I was doing research to see if I could find any information
about the company.  Unfortunately, I had no success.  I have contacted Mega
group, (our buying group) to see if perhaps they had any information, but...
again another brick wall.  I cannot find a web site, or any listing in
"Furniture Today" (a listing of all manufacturers in the U.S.)  If I come
across anything I will let you know.  Do you know what pieces in particular
this fellow is looking for?  Perhaps we could source another vendor.??
     If I can be of further assistance, please feel free to call, email,
fax, or send message via messenger pigeon; whichever method you perfer.

Looking forward to your next contact.

E.T.   (better known as Sherry).
