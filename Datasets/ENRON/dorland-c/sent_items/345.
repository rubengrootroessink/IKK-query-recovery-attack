Judi,

Did you receive a quote for Williams yet? When I spoke with Terri she said that $5000 USD was a pretty good estimate for my move.

I haven't been given instructions from anyone at Enron in regards to the reimbursement of the car loss and how they want it to be handled,   I will enquire with Dawn and one of us will let you know once it's decided,

Looks OK except that it doesn't include the reimbursement for my car.

Thanx,

Chris

   Good morning Chris,
   Please find attached a Relocation Planner which outlines the estimated
   costs for your move.   I have e-mailed this to Dawn Doucet with a
   request for authorization of the additional costs above the $11,250


   Please call if you wish to discuss,

   Judi During
   Relocation Consultant
