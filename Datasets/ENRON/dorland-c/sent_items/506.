I am going to be moving back to Calgary from Houston in mid september and am looking to buy a loft or condo in the downtown area. I am thinking about 17th ave. and Kensington but I am open to other ideas. I will be in Calgary a couple of times in the next few months and would be interested in getting together to look at properties. If you could send me an e-mail with your contact info. I will call you to arrange an appointment. Thanx for the time.
