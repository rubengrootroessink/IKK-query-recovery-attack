Tamara,

Thanx for the info. I have 17" wheels on it now so I guess I will have to get wheels and tires. Do you know what the 16" wheels look like? Is there somewhere on the net I can see an example. Also I will need to have my car winterized (install a blockheater ect...) when I move back so I will give you a call then.

Chris,

Please disregard my last e-mail. I guess I completely misunderstood your
message. I just need to know if your tires are 16 or 17 inch. If the are 17
inch you will need wheels and tires, but if they are only 16 inch then tires
are all you need. Reason being, it is recommended that the IS300 is driven
with 16 inch tires in the winter time. For pricing you are looking at
$1686.00+gst
(17 inch) and $746.00+gst (16 inch). The brand of tires that are recommended
are Michelin Pilot Alpine Roh extreme wheel.
If you need any other information please e-mail or phone @ (403)291-2111

Al,

I am moving to Calgary from Houston and am wondering if Lexus has a
winter wheel/tire package for the 2001 IS 300. If not could you
recommend a wheel / tire dealer in Calgary who could help me find
something that would work. Thanx for your time.
