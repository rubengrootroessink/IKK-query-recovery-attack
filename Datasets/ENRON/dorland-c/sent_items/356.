When I was 26 I was looking for an 18 year old girlfriend who looks exactly like Britney Spears. Keep your eyes open. 2 Weeks till I am back in Calgary. I can't wait. Sold my car yesterday to a buddy of mine down here. I'm going to buy an Grand Cherokee Limited like my mom's. Black I think. What's new? I can't wait to get this move over and get settled in Calgary. I am really excited to move into my new place. It is going to be sweet. I think I can accomodate your request for a synthetic pillow. Are we going to be able to get some golf in before the snow comes? Talk to you soon.

Chris
