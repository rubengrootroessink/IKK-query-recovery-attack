A woman has been married to her husband for 30 years. Their sex life has
become really dull.  So one day she decides to spice things up by purchasing
a pair of crotchless panties.  One night while her husband was watching TV,
she put on her crotchless panties and hiked her leg up on the TV.

"Do you want some of this?" she asked her husband.

But he replied, "Hell no, look what it did to your panties!"
