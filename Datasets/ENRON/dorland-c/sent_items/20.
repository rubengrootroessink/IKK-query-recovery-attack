What's up? I am still not doing much at work. Waiting for the UBS deal to be finalized and then it is back to work. Really excited for that too happen. You can only surf the net for so long. Kerri's wedding will be fun. Where are they having it? The round-up center or something. Not sure where that is. Hope all is well. Talk to you soon.
