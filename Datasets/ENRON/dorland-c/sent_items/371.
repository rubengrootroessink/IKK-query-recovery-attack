John,

Here is what I think my out of pocket costs of this move will be:

Movers - $7500 CND
Flight - $1500 CND
Temp. Accomodations - $1500 CND
October Rent - $1500 CND

I am already at $12000 CND and I haven't even got to the car or any incidental costs yet.

Chris

I talked to Milly yesterday, he was ok with the concept of covering the 1 month salary.  I talked to Trish and the easiest/non-tax affected way to handle it is to submit expense forms.  The problem is if you sell the car at a loss, then the loss compensation is tax deductible, if you import the car, then the transport costs/imports duties can be submitted as an expense and is not exposed to taxes. I talked to Trish about exactly what you have proposed and she wasn't sure from an equity standpoint between what was given to other employees that she could do that. However, don't worry about it I'll do my best so that you are kept whole in one way or another.  The easiest position for me to push is if you actually want to keep your car, then you can expense the duty.

John,

Did you have a chance to talk to Dawn / Milly? Even if you want to work the flight / hotel / movers the usual way and then pay the balance as a "signing bonus" or something that would probably work. I am going to take a bath on my car in a big way. The option of moving my it back to Canada is out of the question as I just found out I would have to pay 6.1% import duty, 7% GST and about $400 in excise taxes and permits. Let me know.
