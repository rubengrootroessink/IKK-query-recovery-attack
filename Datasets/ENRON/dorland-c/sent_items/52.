What's going on? I hope school is going well. I am sure you have heard but things are getting back to normal around here. I think working for UBS is going to be really good. Seems like the cultures are going to mix really well. I am thinking about buying a porsche. I really like the 993's but I don't really like the 996's. Looking around for a nice low km 1994-97 C4. Anyway don't work too hard and keep in touch.
