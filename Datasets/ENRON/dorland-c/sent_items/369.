Hi Chris.  I have some information for you about how to bring your car into Canada.  You'll have to do a little leg work, but you will get the  answers you're looking for.

First thing... call the Registrar of Imported Vehicles (RIV) here in Canada (1-888-848-8240 toll free U.S. & Canada).    You'll need the make, model, year, and original purchase price of your car.   This agency will tell you if your car is eligible for import and what if any modifications are required.    Costs associated with this can be reimbursed under your relocation package.

Generally you do not have to pay duty on the car if it originates from the U.S.    You'll have to pay 7% GST on the purchase value (less depreciation if you've had the car more than 30 days) converted into CAD$ using the f/x rate on the date of import.  There are some excise taxes for having an air conditioner ($100) or for a vehicle weighing more than 4,425 pounds.  Costs associated with this can be reimbursed under your relocation package.

Once you have an estimate of the costs for bringing your car here please let us know in case your relocation budget needs to be reviewed.


   This document explains the process in more detail and has an example of the cost calculation.

Talk to you later,
