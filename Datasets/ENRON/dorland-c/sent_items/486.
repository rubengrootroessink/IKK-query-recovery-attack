I looked at the MLS listings and there is some stuff on there. I have a
realtor who seems to have her act together. Don't worry about it. How long
would it take me to get to work from there?

      Done. I'm moving in! Can I borrow your lawn mower? I need to decide
   what
      I
      am going to do with my ride. I think I am going to bring it with me
   and
      buy
      a set of winter wheels and some killer winter tires. Don't you have a
      tire
      guy?

            townhouses
            etc. Kerri? Haven't seen here for a while, hear she is pretty
      serious

            I really want to live in Altadore. I hear that is where all the
      fly
            bitches
            hang. I don't know to be honest Killarney / Altadore / West
      Hillhurst
         ?
            Close to downtown. I am thinking infill / townhouse. My mom has
   a
         friend
            who says there are nice brownstone townhomes in Altadore. I am
         thinking
            of
            checking those out. I am looking for minimal maintenance. Do
   you
      have
            any
            ideas? Seen Kerri Murray lately?
