Hi

Sorry if I blew your party girl cover with one of your colleauges. Cooper and I were out on one of our many walks and I thought I would say hi. Hope you are feeling better now. Saturday was fun. I shouldn't have gone to the bar. Ended up losing Max at the drink and going home. He was on a rant about his girlfriend and how women are all screwed up. I imagine he picked up some lonely girl. I would love to do lunch one day next week. Let me know when is good for you and if you like sushi. Take it easy.

Chris

Hi Chris, how's it going? I heard you stopped by yesterday but I wasn't
here...I was actually sick! Not still recovering from Saturday, I try to
keep my weekend binges on the lowdown here, not that they believe me but
I try.
Did you have fun Saturday? How was Crazy Horse? I actually had the same
cabbie as you guys who drove me home, he said he picked up 2 guys that
seemed to be angry with women and looking to go out on the town! That's
not how I figured it out...he said he picked you guys up at the same
house.
We'll have to make plans to go for lunch sometime soon. My work # is
294-3362 ext 224.
Talk to you soon,
Leslie
