What's up? Good to hear from you. I am very happily back in Calgary. Things at Enron are totally fucked up right now. Not really sure how it is going to play out. Anyway life goes on. Tell D'arcy I made less than 10 million last year. Take it easy and I'll right more later.

Hey Chris,

How are you doing?  How are things at Enron.  I was shocked to see the stock
price today.

Are you back in Calgary or still in Houston?

Let me know, are you coming to visit.  Do I have stories for you!!!

Speak to you soon,

Mohammad
