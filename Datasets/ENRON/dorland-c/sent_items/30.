Hi Traci,

I had a very relaxing weekend. Slept 10 hours both nights. Worked out and chilled. Very good weekend except for the weather. No worries about Friday. The highways were ridiculous. My brother is coming to town on Thursday for a week. It will be good to see him. I am planning on being in Red Deer on the weekend of the 8th. Maybe we can get together then. Let me know if you are free.Have a great week and I will speak to you soon!

Chris

Hello Chris.

All appendages still attached?  Hope you enjoyed your cooking class and had
an enjoyable weekend.   Sorry I had to cancel on Friday, weather here is
still awful..

Have a good week!
