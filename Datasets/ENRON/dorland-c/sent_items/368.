Tricia,

I have already spoken to the RIV and Canada Customs. My car was manufactured in Japan and thus would be subject to an import duty of 6.1%, the GST and excise and import costs.

Purchase price = 35000 USD = 54000 CND
Duty on this amount = 3300
GST on this amount = 3800
Excise tax = 180
Permits = 400

Plus costs to convert the speedometer and odometer to the metric system and label all safety systems with french language instructions (from RIV) = approx. 500

That brings us to $8200 CND plus the cost to actually transport it from Houston to Calgary (at least $2000). Total approximately $10000 CND.

Hardly seems like the best option.

Also, I called Williams moving to find out what the cost was to move me down here last year. And the invoice just for the move of my household goods from Calgary to Houston was $4700 USD. Just off the top of my head my out of pocket costs will be:

Movers = $7300 CND (4700 USD)
Flight = $1500 CND
Hotel = $1500 CND
October Rent = $1500 (I have a 1 year lease in Houston that expires at the end of October)

The total of the above is $11 800.

Hi Chris.  I have some information for you about how to bring your car into Canada.  You'll have to do a little leg work, but you will get the  answers you're looking for.

First thing... call the Registrar of Imported Vehicles (RIV) here in Canada (1-888-848-8240 toll free U.S. & Canada).    You'll need the make, model, year, and original purchase price of your car.   This agency will tell you if your car is eligible for import and what if any modifications are required.    Costs associated with this can be reimbursed under your relocation package.

Generally you do not have to pay duty on the car if it originates from the U.S.    You'll have to pay 7% GST on the purchase value (less depreciation if you've had the car more than 30 days) converted into CAD$ using the f/x rate on the date of import.  There are some excise taxes for having an air conditioner ($100) or for a vehicle weighing more than 4,425 pounds.  Costs associated with this can be reimbursed under your relocation package.

Once you have an estimate of the costs for bringing your car here please let us know in case your relocation budget needs to be reviewed.


 << File: Importing a Vehicle.pdf >>   This document explains the process in more detail and has an example of the cost calculation.

Talk to you later,
