What is the specific appeal of distressed debt? If you are going to trade debt or equities GS is the place to be.

Nicely done with the email.

What do you think of my next career move (still a few years away) --
distressed debt trader at Goldman Sachs.

I found a guy who will hire me and I think I want to do it (mostly 'cause
no chicks do), but will have to wait until I am willing to stop partying
until all hours during the week (i.e. a few years away).  You really do
have to come visit while I am here.  I can't see moving any time soon, but
that being said I am thinking about putting some time in in London and/or
Paris at some point, so we'll have to see.  Why don't you do your
Amsterdam/Paris/London trip in late Nov when I am thinking of doing
mine....those are the three cities I was thinking of hitting on mine
anyway.  We oculd meet up.  DIdn't know you were going to that wedding this
w/e.  Say HI to my parents for me.  And TOm and Vicky Liles.  And my little
bro.  Johnny Zuk is engaged too, hey?  Does Dan have a g.f.?  31 isn't too
old...Are you going to go visit her?  I should go save this company from
the depths o fbankrupt despair now.  LAter.

Jill,

Sorry about the brief first reply things have been a little busy. What is
with people (that article) ? Working long hours just for the sake of
working long hours. I am pushing for a 4 day work week.
Why Calgary? Why not? I love Calgary. Actually the guy that ran our trading
operation in Calgary is getting married to an American who works in Houston
so he is moving to accommodate her career. This has left a hole in our
Canadian operation and my boss felt that I was just the cork to fill that
hole. I think it is a promotion. Besides, Houston in the arm pit of the
world. This city has few redeeming features. What it lacks in culture and
sophistication it makes up for by its lack of clean air and any form of
natural beauty. Actually, it isn't that bad. Houston has good restaurants,
decent night life and the people are really friendly but given the choice I
would much rather live in Calgary. In this business odds are that I will
find myself back here sooner than later so might as well enjoy Canada while
I can.

Kerrie got engaged. Good for her. I have a cactus in my bathroom that is
dying from lack of attention. I am not engaged. I was seeing someone for a
while but she took a work assignment in Venezuela. No big loss. Too old for
me anyway (31).

Glad to hear that you are enjoying you time in NY. I am going to have to
visit some time. I know I say that every time we chat but I really would
like to try to get down there before you move on to your next destination.
Or is NY home for a while?

No Vacation plans other than that I am going to Matt and Jen's wedding this
weekend. Should be a good party and I hung out with those guys quite a bit
when I was living in Calgary. Also I am going to look for a place to live
in Calgary in Friday. My friend Mohammed from TO is moving to Rotterdam to
do his MBA so I might try to visit him in the spring. Do a little
Amsterdam, Paris, London whirlwind tour.

My family is doing great. My dad sold Titan to a Comglomerate from the US
and is retiring in January and my mom is up to the same stuff. Dancing and
buying shit for their house. Both of their health is great. My dad has been
playing lots of golf and feeling great.

How is Meg doing? Is she in Australia now? I should get in touch with her.
I saw Reagan Neiss in commercial for her TV show last night. Good for her.
I hope all goes well for her. Dan did go to D's wedding. Said it was really
nice. Still don't get that one?

I have to stop writing now my fingers hurt. Keep in touch.

Chris

(this e-mail is record length for me)

   That's it?  That's all I get after all this time?
   How are you?
   Good to hear you are excited to go back to Calgary, if that is where you
   are headed next.
   I am in Virginia at the moment working at client's office (a troubled
   telecom company; like they're not a dime a dozen).  Nice to stay in a
   hotel
   and live for free for a change.  For the past few weeks I have been
   living
   the life of a consultant, flying to VA for Tues through Thurs and in the
   office Mon and Fri.  I don't mind.  It's good for the pocketbook and for
   the frequent flyer points.  Plus it works out that I get all my weekends
   off that way.

   Why back to Calgary?

   Have you heard the big news?  It is only a few days old so I am sure you
   haven't, but Kerrie got engaged.

   Are you engaged?  Just asking because everyone but me is, it would
   appear.
   Any new news in that department for you?  I have started seeing someone
   new, but it is really casual and really new.  He is another lawyer and
   from
   St. Albert, Alberta of all places!  Met him at a cocktail part for
   Canadian
   lawyers working in New York.  Speaking of which, I am coming up on my
   one
   year anniversary of living here (and of having a real job) and am loving
   both living here and work.  No complaints.  Am off to my best friend
   from
   law school's wedding in Vancouver in Sept so I am taking a week off
   then,
   other than that no big vacay planned for the summer.  And you?  I do
   plan
   on going to visit a close friend who is moving to Paris in the fall so
   I'll
   likely go for American Thanksgiving, but that's about it.

   Meghan was here visiting when she was back in June.  Liles came to town
   the
   same w/e.  Shauna Snow (who is also engaged) and Jackie Boase came here
   for
   a visit as well in early May.  We had a blast, of course.  Liles came as
   well that w/e.  The parents made their first trip to the big city in
   March
   and had a fabulous time and have already planned their top ten things to
   do
   during their next visit.  It has been a good year for having people come
   visit (even though my dorm room at UofA was bigger than my apt, we all
   survived).

   How is your fam?  Dev said he was at Matt's stag party and Danny came
   home
   and surprised him.  That's cool.  I guess that wedding is this w/e.  Did
   he
   go to Dion and Suzanne's wedding?  My mom got a kick out of calling me
   to
   say she was going to my first ex-boyfriend's wedding that day.  What are
   Kent and Judy up to this summer?  How's their health?  (wasn't sure how
   to
   pluralize that).  How is Dan liking TO?

   There.  Now you have no choice but to write back a longer, more
   informative
   email.

   Later

   Hope you're well and not working too hard -- even early retirement isn't
   worth it!

   For me it isn't about fulfillment or finding my life's purpose in my
   work.
   It's all about the $$$. Work hard and retire early.

   Cheers

   Chris

   P.S. I am moving back to Calgary in about a month. Enron continues to
   feel
   free to move me around at will. I am actually really looking forward to
   it.
