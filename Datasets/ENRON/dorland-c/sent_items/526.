>>A Vegas Story  
>>  
>>For anyone who didn't see David Letterman's take on this:  
>>(And it's a true story...)  
>>  
>>On a recent weekend in Atlantic City, a woman won a  
>>bucketful of quarters at a slot machine. She took a  
>>break from the slots for dinner with her husband in the  
>>hotel dining room. But first she wanted to stash the  
>>quarters in her room. "I'll be right back and we'll go  
>>to eat," she told her husband and carried the coin-laden  
>>bucket to the elevator.  
>>  
>>As she was about to walk into the elevator she noticed  
>>two men already aboard. Both were black. One of them was  
>>tall...very tall...an intimidating figure. The woman  
>>froze. Her first thought was: These two are going to rob  
>>me. Her next thought was: Don't be a bigot; they look  
>>like perfectly nice gentlemen. But racial stereotypes  
>>are powerful and fear immobilized her.  
>>  
>>She stood and stared at the two men. She felt anxious,  
>>flustered and ashamed. She hoped they didn't read her  
>>mind but Gosh; they had to know what she was thinking!!!  
>>Her hesitation about joining them in the elevator was  
>>all too obvious now. Her face was flushed. She couldn't  
>>just stand there, so with a mighty effort of will she  
>>picked up one foot and stepped forward and followed with  
>>the other foot and was on the elevator. Avoiding eye  
>>contact, she turned around stiffly and faced the  
>>elevator doors as they closed. A second passed, and then  
>>another second, and then another. Her fear increased!  
>>The elevator didn't move. Panic consumed her. My God,  
>>she thought, I'm trapped and about to be robbed!  
>>  
>>Her heart plummeted. Perspiration poured from every  
>>pore. Then one of the men said, "Hit the floor."  
>>Instinct told her to do what they told her. The bucket  
>>of quarters flew upwards as she threw out her arms and  
>>dove to the elevator floor. A shower of coins  
>>rained down on her. Take my money and spare me, she prayed.  
>>  
>>More seconds passed. She heard one of the men say  
>>politely, "Ma'am, if you'll just tell us what floor  
>>you're going to, we'll push the button." The one who  
>>said it had a little trouble getting the words out. He  
>>was trying mightily to hold in a belly laugh. The woman  
>>lifted her head and looked up at the two men. They  
>>reached down to help her up. Confused, she struggled to  
>>her feet. "When I told my friend here to hit the  
>>floor," said the average sized one, "I meant that he  
>>should hit the elevator button for our floor. I didn't  
>>mean for you to actually hit the floor, ma'am."  
>>  
>>He spoke genially. He bit his lip. It was obvious he was  
>>having a hard time not laughing. The woman thought: My  
>>God, what a spectacle I've made of myself. She was  
>>humiliated to speak. She wanted to blurt out an apology,  
>>but words failed her. How do you apologize to two  
>>perfectly respectable gentlemen for behaving as though  
>>they were going to rob you? She didn't know what to say.  
>>The three of them gathered up the strewn quarters and  
>>refilled her bucket.  
>>  
>>When the elevator arrived at her floor they then  
>>insisted on walking her to her room. She seemed a little  
>>unsteady on her feet, and they were afraid she might not  
>>make it down the corridor.  
>>  
>>At her door they bid her a good evening. As she slipped  
>>into her room she could hear them roaring with laughter  
>>as they walked back to the elevator. The woman brushed  
>>herself off. She pulled herself together and went  
>>downstairs for dinner with her husband.  
>>  
>>The next morning flowers were delivered to her room  
>>- a dozen roses.  
>>  
>>Attached to EACH rose was a crisp one hundred dollar  
>>bill. The card said: "Thanks for the best laugh we've  
>>had in years." It was signed;  
>>Eddie Murphy, Michael Jordan  
>>  
>>PS - This was too funny not to send to you. Pass this  
>>around so others can enjoy.
