If you are bored try to find out what your tire guy thinks of Dunlop Winter Sport M2 tires. Is you tire guy also a wheel guy? I need some winter wheels as well.

I was confused by your use of 2 spellings. Did you like my Austin Power's
reference? "I know. That's how we do it in Belgium. It's called a Belgium
dip" You are back in my good graces. Try not to confuse the dumb fat kid.

      Coming to town Thursday for the weekend and hopefully moving by the
      middle
      of September. Spending Friday house shopping. I think I am going to
   end
      up
      in your neck of the woods. Seems like the best values are in that
   area.
      Are
      we going to get some snow this winter? We need to find Dorland a
   date. I
      am
      going to a wedding this weekend and there should be lots of single
      chicas
      there. I am really looking forward to being back in Cow town. Houston
   is
      painfull.

      Later
