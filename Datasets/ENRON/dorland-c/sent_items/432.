Hi Chris,
Thank you for your quote request  on the Grand Cherokee.
I am just getting some numbers for you and I was  curious if you had decided if you were looking to purchase, finance, or  lease.
Just let me know and I will put together all the options for you  so you can see the different costs and/or monthly payments and decide what works  for you.
Thanks very much,
