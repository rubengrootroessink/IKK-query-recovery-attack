What's going on. When I moved to Houston my e-mail address book got toasted so I am glad you sent your address. What's new? Where are you working now? I am in Houston trading electricity now. I like the job but the city is a dump.
 
Take it easy

Chris

As you know, I gave up  my 3 month vacation as a beach bum a few weeks ago, and have joined the real world again (definately prefer the bum lifestyle!!).   And after a record-breaking move that started at 10pm and ended at 6:00am, I am now settled into a place back on the westside. As always, my door is open (literally), if you are looking for some California sun.
