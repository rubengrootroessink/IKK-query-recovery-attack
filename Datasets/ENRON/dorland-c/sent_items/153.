I hear your sister is looking for a piece of action so I thought you might tell her about the kid.

Graduated in 1997 with an HBA from The Richard Ivey School of Business (University of Western Ontario)

Started at Enron in may 97 as an analyst in the trading group working for Lavorato doing fundament analysis and acting as Lavo's trading assistant (slave)

Started out trading BC Cash desk in June of 98.

Moved over to trade short term Aeco in Sept 99. Did that for a year. Mike McDermott and Laird can let you know if I was any good.

Went to Houston in Sept 2000 to trade east power. Traded Cinergy cash desk and worked next to Fletch Sturm (Cinergy Term Trader) for a year. Learned a little bit about trading from him.

You know the rest.

What are her measurements again. 26 36 26

Can that be right?
