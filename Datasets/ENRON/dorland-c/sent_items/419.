Thank you very much. How long would it take to get something like this in? I will be in Calgary on Sept. 6/7 and will come by and see you. Could you e-mail me your work phone number.

Thanx

Chris Dorland

Hi Chris,

I am attaching the breakdown on a Grand Cherokee that matches your request
as closely as possible.

The MSRP on the unit is $51,570 with pretty well every conceivable option -
I can get you this Grand Cherokee for the cash price of $45,188 including
rebates.

Take a look at the attachment and let me know if you have any questions or
comments.

Have a great day,

Dwayne
