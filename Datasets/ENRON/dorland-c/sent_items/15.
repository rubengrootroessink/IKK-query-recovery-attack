I think I saw her. If it was her she was pretty cute. Dan and I went to Earls last night and then just chilled. His flight was 2 hours late and they lost his bags. We are going back to the Deer tonight and I am going to have some people over tommorow pre-whiskey (around 7:30). You should come by tommorow night. My home number is 214-0454 and my cell is 875-6146. Talk to you later.

Chris

Possibly, she's got dark hair that's just above her shoulders. I don't really
recall if there was anyone else coming in at the same time.
How's Dan? Did you guys do anything last night?
Is there a plan yet for tomorrow?
