I really want to live in Altadore. I hear that is where all the fly bitches hang. I don't know to be honest Killarney / Altadore / West Hillhurst ? Close to downtown. I am thinking infill / townhouse. My mom has a friend who says there are nice brownstone townhomes in Altadore. I am thinking of checking those out. I am looking for minimal maintenance. Do you have any ideas? Seen Kerri Murray lately?

Actually lots. Keep this on the QT for now but this kid is moving back to
cow town. I'll be in town next week shopping for somewhere to live. Just in
time for ski season.

Later
