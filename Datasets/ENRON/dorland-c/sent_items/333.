Carlos,
 
Could you run a report that shows all the deals in my books (Financial and Gas Daily) as of close of business on Friday (Sept.14). I doubt I will do any trading over the next couple of days but you should probably wait until tommorow afternoon to run it.
 
Thanx,
 
Chris

Carlos
 
Thanx for the pos report. Would you mind sending it to me each morning? Also, can you make sure that they have all of the deals (other than the few I have done) transferred out of my book by the end of the week. I talked to Brian? and he said he would look after it but can you make sure it happens.
 
Thanx,
 
Chris
