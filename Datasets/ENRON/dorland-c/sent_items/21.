Hi Chris, yeah I'll be around this weekend and likely up for a drink or two. As long as you don't keep spreading my weekend parties around my office! Just kidding. I actually got an email from Steph at the same time as you telling me about Dan so I don't know who else I would talk to that would care, but I can give it a shot.
Oh yeah...as for the girl I was thinking I should set you up with, she was away last week when you came in but if you're ever wandering around, she sits in the second office in that's behind you when you are standing at the reception desk, her name is Tina and she's one of our financial advisors, really cute & really nice. So you can come check her out and of course stop by and say hi to me.
I'll see you Saturday, if not sooner.
Leslie
