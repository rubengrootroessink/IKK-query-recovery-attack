Kim,

I am going to be moving back to the Calgary office in about a month and I wanted to touch base with you so we can organize any HR issues before I go. In particular I was wondering what happens to my Enron savings plan (401k) when I go back. Let me know if there is anything you need me to do for you.

Chris
