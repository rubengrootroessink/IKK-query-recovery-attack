Mikey,

I am thinking of going with a townhouse / infill as opposed to an apartement style condo. I am going to look mostly in the Altadore / Killarney area. I think you get more house for your $ there as opposed to West Hillhurst. A couple of people have told me to check out Garrison Woods. Have you heard of it? What is the plan for the weekend. You should come down to Red Deer on Friday and have Earl's with the Dorlands. Maybe we could track down Johnny after. Are you taking a chica to the wedding? I am so looking forward to coming home. I got my face ripped off last week. Talk to you later...

Chris
