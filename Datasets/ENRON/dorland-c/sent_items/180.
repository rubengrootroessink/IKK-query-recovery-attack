Mohammad,

What's going on? Hope all you exams went well. Are you coming home for the holidays? If so give me a shout in the office, at home or in Red Deer. Things are a little nuts around here but everything with me is fine and I have a few alternatives to consider. All the best to you and your family.

Chris

MH

What's up? Good to hear from you. I am very happily back in Calgary. Things
at Enron are totally fucked up right now. Not really sure how it is going
to play out. Anyway life goes on. Tell D'arcy I made less than 10 million
last year. Take it easy and I'll right more later.

Chris

   Hey Chris,

   How are you doing?  How are things at Enron.  I was shocked to see the
   stock
   price today.

   Are you back in Calgary or still in Houston?

   Let me know, are you coming to visit.  Do I have stories for you!!!

   Speak to you soon,

   Mohammad
