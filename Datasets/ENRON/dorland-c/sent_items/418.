I bought a brownstone in the River Park / Altadore area. #402 3511 14a St. SW. A really cool area and a great place. We will have to grab some sushi and catch up when I get back.

Talk to you soon.

Chris

Kerrie,

Congratulations! I actually heard the big news last week from Jill (of
course) but I have been meaning to drop you a line. I was in town last
weekend for Matt and Jen's wedding and while I was there I bought a house
in Calgary. I'm moving back on September 15th to trade gas again for Enron.
One again congrats and I'll give you a call when I get back to town.

Chris

   I hope all is well.

   Kerrie
