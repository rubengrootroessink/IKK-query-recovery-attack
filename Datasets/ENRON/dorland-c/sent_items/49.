Traci,

I am really looking forward to my cooking class. My first one is this Saturday morning. I'm a little scared I am going to be the class screw up. Oh well, I won't know untill I try. I think I am going to Yoga on Wednesday but dinner on Friday would be great. Give me a shout or drop me an e-mail and let me know what time you want to eat and I'll make some reservations. Talk to you soon.

Chris

Good Morning!

I am having a crazy week!  At least it is keeping me out of trouble!
I really enjoyed seeing you again as well.  It is good to see that you are
doing so well!

I have two appointments this week in Calgary.  Wednesday I have two and
Friday afternoon another.  If you want to get together either Wednesday for
Coffee (after 7 sometime) or Friday for a later dinner (after 6 sometime)
let me know.

Good luck with your cooking classes! Hopefully all appendages remain
attached.

Talk with you soon!

Traci
