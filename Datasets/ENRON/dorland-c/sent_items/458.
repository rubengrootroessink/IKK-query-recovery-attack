Chris,

Just wanted to touch base before you come down this weekend.  I am going to
Phil's stag in the Shuswap on Friday, but will be coming back on Sunday
around supper time.  Your mom said that you are staying until Monday, so
hopefully you'll be around to go out for supper or grab a movie Sunday night
when I get back.  Good luck house hunting, and I'll give you a phone call on
Sunday on my way home.

Ryan
P.S.  Try to find a place that has a nice guest suite...you know ensuite
with jacuzzi tub etc...
