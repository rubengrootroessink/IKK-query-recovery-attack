The guy who ran our trading operation in Calgary really wanted to move back to Houston because his girlfriend lives hear so that left a hole in our Calgary trading operation so they asked me to come back. See you in a couple of weeks.

Chris,

No, I hadn't heard, but from my end, selfishly, that's great news!  What
happened, because last I heard from your mom, you had signed on for 2 or 3
(poor memory on my part) years in Houston.  We should arrange some golf
while you're back if there's time.  I'll give you a call next week to touch
base...I'm going to Panorama for a few days with Cari tonight, but will be
back next Tuesday.

Talk to you later,
Rye
