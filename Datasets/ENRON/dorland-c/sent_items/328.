Subject:=09accounted for

I just wanted to thank all of you for getting in touch over the past day
and a half and expressing your concern for my well-being and the well-being
of my friends here in New York.  At a time of crisis of such a magnitude it
helped to feel loved even though I am far away from most of you.  I am sure
I will talk to most of you over the next couple of days if I have not done
so already.

Thanks again,

Love Jill
