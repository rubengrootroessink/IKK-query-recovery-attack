Coming to town Thursday for the weekend and hopefully moving by the middle of September. Spending Friday house shopping. I think I am going to end up in your neck of the woods. Seems like the best values are in that area. Are we going to get some snow this winter? We need to find Dorland a date. I am going to a wedding this weekend and there should be lots of single chicas there. I am really looking forward to being back in Cow town. Houston is painfull.

Later

cd
