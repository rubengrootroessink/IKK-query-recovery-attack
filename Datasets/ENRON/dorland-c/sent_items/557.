I slept (was passed out) through the whole thing. My car is on the 4th floor of the parkade so luckily it was fine. I love the MTV movie awards. Shannon Elizabeth rules. Halle Berry naked in Swordfish. Can't wait. What's new with you?

Holy shite! 
A little wet down there apparently...Did your car get flooded out in the parkade?  
Mike. 
PS. 
Did you see Nadia from American Pie on the MTV Video awards?  Wow.
