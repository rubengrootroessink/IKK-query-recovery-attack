I will be moving to Houston by the end of the month. I am actually going to 
be trading electricity so that should be an interesting change from nat gas.
We will have to hook up once I get settled. How much longer are you going to 
be in Boston? How far is Dallas from Houston? 

Keep in touch!

Chris
