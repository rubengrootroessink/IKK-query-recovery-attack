Paul,

I would like the following data (and anything else you can think of):

Daily Power Prices

- PJM West / East (Others?)
- NYPP  
- Cinergy
-TVA
- any other markets that you think are relevant

Temperatures (Max, Min, Mean)

- Philadelphia
- Allentown
- Pittsburg
- Washington DC
- Newark
- Baltimore
- NYC

Gas Prices

- Transco Zone 6 Non- NY and NY
- What other pipes are close to the above cities? 

Supply (Generation)

- Any information you have on generation in PJM (by plant) including:
 - Fuel type
 - Capacity (typical production vs. maximum production)
 - Efficiency (heat rates) / Marginal production costs 
 - Historic outages
 - Forecast Outages
 - Who owns / operates the facilities?
 - Reserves ?
(I am trying to understand what the supply curve for PJM looks like but I am 
not sure if I am asking the correct questions. What parts of the puzzle am I 
missing?)

Demand (Load)

- Historic load information for PJM

Interchanges

- What are the historic imports and exports in and out of PJM
- What are the costs associated with wheeling power in and out of PJM ? 


Thank you for all your help and please include any other info. you think may 
be relevant.
