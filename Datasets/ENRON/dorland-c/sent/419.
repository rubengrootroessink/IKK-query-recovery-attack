Just thought I'd send a quick note to keep in touch and let you know what
I've been up to.  This is a picture from one of my first assignments in
March of last year during spring break in Panama City Fl.  The nice young
lady in the picture is, along with all of the other "competitors", wearing a
BIGWORDS T-Shirt.  Wilson, I'll defer to Grump for a joke.

My next assignment is the national cheerleading championships in Orlando Fl
in two weeks.

Hope everything is going well for you guys,
Talk to you later.
Kramer

 Hey T
Thought you might get a kick out of this one.  Looks like your fellas over
at Big Words are doing a great job with their grass roots marketing
campaigns.
