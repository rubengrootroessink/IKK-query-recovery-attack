What questions? I accidentally deleted your e-mail from yesterday and don't 
remember any questions. I hadn't seen the jokes before but they were pretty 
funny. The sports ones were pretty good. The others were pretty tasteless, so 
they were my favorites. I feel much better today. I'm already getting psyched 
up for the weekend. I am going to play golf and not drink. I hate alcohol. I 
am on the wagon. For good this time. At least for a week anyway.
