Subject: I Am Canadian



   My name is Bob, and I am Canadian.

   I am a minority in Vancouver, Banff, and every casino in this country.

   I was born in 1972, yet I am responsible for some Native's great great
   grandfather who screwed himself out of his land in the 1800's.

   I pay import tax on cars made in Ontario.

   I am allowed to skydive and smoke, but not allowed to drive without a
   seat belt.

   All the money I make up until mid July must go to paying taxes.

   I live and work among people who believe Americans are ignorant.

   These same people cannot name this country's new Territory.

   Although I am sometimes forced to live on Kraft Dinner and don't have a
   pot to piss in, I sleep well knowing that I've helped purchase a nice
six
   figure home in Vancouver for some unskilled Chinese refugee.

   Although they are unpatriotic and constantly try to separate, Quebec
   still  provides my nation's Prime Ministers.

   95% of my nation's international conflicts are over fish.

   I'm supposed to call black people African Canadians, although I'm sure
   none of them have ever been to Africa, or east of Halifax for that
matter.

   I believe that paying a 200% tax on alcohol is fair.

   I believe that same tax on gasoline is also fair.

   Even if I have no idea what happened to that old rifle my grandfather
   gave me when I was 14, I will be considered a criminal if I don't
register
   it.

   I DO know Jeff from Toronto.

   I often badmouth the United States, and then vacation there three times
   a year.

   I'm led to believe that some lazy ass unionized broom pusher who makes
   $30 an hour is underpaid and therefore must go on strike, but paying $10
an
   hour to someone who works 12 hour shifts at forty below on an oil rig is
fair.

   I believe that paying $30 million for 3 stripes (The Voice of Fire) by
   the National Art Gallery was a good purchase, even though 99% of this
   country didn't want it, or will ever see it.

   When I look at my pay stub and realize that I take home a third of what
   I actually make, I say "Oh well, at least we have better health care
than
   the Americans"

   It must bail out farmers when their crops are too wet or too dry,
   because I control the rain.

   My National Anthem has versions in both official  languages, and I don't
   know either of them.

   Canada is the highest taxed nation in North America, the biggest
   military buffer for the United States, and the number one destination
  for fleeing boat people.

   I am not an angry white male.  I am an angry broke taxpayer.

   My name is Bob, and I am Canadian
