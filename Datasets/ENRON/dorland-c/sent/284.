I am sorry I was short with you on the phone. The gas market is a total shit 
show and our economics are out by $1M . I worked until midnight last night 
and I am very tired. We should buy an ice cream cake from DQ and cook some 
steaks on Saturday after golf. Danny and I can leave after dinner or first 
thing in the morning on Sunday. I hope your (and my) work week improves. See 
you tommorow!

Chris
