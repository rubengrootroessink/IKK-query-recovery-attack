I'm done!

I have tied out positions as of June 6 trading. I have to set up the 
economics page but that shouldn't take long.

What about reversals from our currency book? Which way do the reversals from 
the other books go?

The cash deals aren't all in the model (June 1 - June 6) because the physical 
position doesn't balance but I will talk to Mike about that.

I can see a light at the end of the tunnel. Hopefully this makes things 
easier on you.

Thanx for all your hard work!

Chris
