I am organizing a bachelor party and am interested in information on group 
rates and facility availability. 

Our group will require 5-7 tee times, dinner and cocktails. I am hoping to 
book for one of the following Saturdays:

June 24, 2000
July 8, 2000
July 15, 2000
July 22, 2000

Information on transportation to Red Deer would also be appreciated.


Thank you!

Chris Dorland
