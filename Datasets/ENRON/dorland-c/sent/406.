Mike,

Hope you found a great place to live. It is ridiculous how expensive flats 
are in London. Thank god your making pounds now.

Tahoe was too much traveling for that short of a stay.  Good weather, good 
friends, beautiful scenery, all right snowboarding, shitty food, cheesy 
casinos and too much time in fucking airports. That about summarizes the 
weekend. 

Laird is doing fine. Things have been relatively slow and the market is very 
choppy. I've been pretty quiet. No major axes to grind. Just trying to look 
for the next big trade and keep from getting my head ripped off on EOL.

You have to go out for Middle Eastern food. Go to The Lebanese Restaurant. I 
think it is on Oxford street but I'll find out for sure. Also try Ranoush 
Juice for a falafel.

Good luck and keep in touch!

Chris
