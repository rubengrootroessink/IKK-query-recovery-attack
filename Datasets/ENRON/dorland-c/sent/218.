How are you doing? Did you have a good stampede? I had a great stampede but 
got a nasty cold. Work is going good. Do you know Ryan Flemming? He went to 
Riverglen and is a pretty good friend of mine. Anyway, he is getting married 
August 12 so I've been pretty busy organizing his stag and getting ready for 
his wedding. Went to Red Deer this weekend and saw my parents. Did you know 
my brother moved to Toronto? I need to find a smaller place but for now I'm 
staying in Kensington. That is all that is new in my life. We should hit a 
patio and have a drink one night. 

Take it easy,

Chris
