There will be a fridge cleanout on the 34th and 35th floors at 3:00p.m. 
today, Friday, june 2, 2000.  If you have contents in the fridges which you 
wish to keep, please put a note on your container(s) or let me know and I 
won't throw it out.  If there are no names on any containers I will throw 
them out.

Any questions or concerns, please contact me at ext. 6732.

Thanks - Terri
