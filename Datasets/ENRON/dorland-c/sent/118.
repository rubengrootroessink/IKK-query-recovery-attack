Margaret,

I have completed all of the information and am awaiting my University 
transcripts. The copy in my HR file is missing and I have ordered some but 
this may take 2-3 days. Should I send the other info. and forward the 
transcripts when I receive them or wait and send it all together?

Let me know,

Chris
