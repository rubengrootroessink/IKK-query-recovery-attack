Morgan,

Heard through Bugg your in SF now. You should rethink coming up to Kelowna 
for May long. 

Thinking of going to the bay area to visit some friends sometime soon. Send 
me your number and I'll give you a call. 

Any good stock ideas? Check out MSIA on the Nasdaq OTC board. This could be a 
Qualcomm.

Gotta hop,

Chris Dorland
