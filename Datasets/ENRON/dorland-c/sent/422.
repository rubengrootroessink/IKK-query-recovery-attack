Andrew,

Nice to hear from you. Hope all is well in the UK. The millenium came and 
went and I think I had a good time. 

I understand MH has formally resigned his position at ML. Good for him. That 
is a shit business with no future. The broker is the buggy whip of the 
financial 

services industry. 

I have another friend moving to London soon so I have another reason to 
visit. I have to run but I'll keep in touch.

Take care,

Chris
