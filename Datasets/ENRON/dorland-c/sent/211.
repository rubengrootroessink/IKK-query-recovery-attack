Saturday was really fun. Golf was great. Mike and Andrew's group was by far 
the drunkest foursome. Dinner was good and then we went to the Sutter club to 
play pool. That is when things got out of hand. We got Ryan a bright yellow 
T-shirt with "NOBODY KNOWS I'M A LESBIAN" written in big block letters. Call 
me tonight and I'll give you all the gory details. My head still hurts.
