I have to run a bunch of errands today and pick up some decorations for my 
buddy's wedding this weekend so I can't go golfing. That sucks. It is so nice 
outside. Maybe I'll work up the energy to go for a run later. Probably not. I 
am such a lazy piece of shit lately. I am definately going to go running now. 
Self depreciation has motivated me. I need to buy some rollerblades. Where 
did you get yours? Cowan says that K2 are really good and relatively 
inexpensive. Any thoughts? Maybe I'll look for rollerblades when I'm out this 
afternoon. You should be proud of me. I was able to stay out of the bottle 
all weekend. Quite an accomplishment don't you think. One hour to go. Someone 
shoot me!
