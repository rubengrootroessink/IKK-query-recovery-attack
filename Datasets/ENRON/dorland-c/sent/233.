How's it going? Hear you are working pretty crazy hours. Went to NN with the 
boys on Saturday and played golf in Kananaskis yesterday so all in all a good 
weekend. I have a post stampede cold so I won't be doing much other than work 
and sleep for a few days. Take it easy and write back when you get a minute.
