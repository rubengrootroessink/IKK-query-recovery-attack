The wedding was great! Too much fun. Once again I'm hung over on a monday. No 
great stories except that I nearly wiped out while walking down the aisle. I 
tripped on a cord to a video camera. Mildly embarrassing. My friend was a 
rock. I think I was more nervous than him. Ft. Mac is a total shit hole. On 
my tombstone it wil read " He went to Ft. MacMurray, once."  No Houston for 
me. Thank god. I have to go to a party at my boss's on Saturday. I think I 
might try to play golf as well. I will be taking it very easy. No more booze. 
My liver hurts.
