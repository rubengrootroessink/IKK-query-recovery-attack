It's great that your coming to Calgary to study for a couple of months. 
You'll have to work extra hard in June so you can kick back during Stampede. 
Things here are pretty much unchanged. Working quite a bit and doing a little 
snowboarding and beer drinking on the weekends. Things could definately be 
worse. Going golfing in Playa del Carmen in a couple of weeks. That should be 
fun. Looking forward to chilling out by the pool for a week and doing 
nothing. This year has been a roller coaster ride for my trading profits and 
I need a break. Met a really cool girl recently. Will advise if anything 
interesting devolops there. It's a beautiful Sunday afternoon and I have no 
idea why I am at work. I think I'm going to go to the driving range. Take it 
easy and w/b!
