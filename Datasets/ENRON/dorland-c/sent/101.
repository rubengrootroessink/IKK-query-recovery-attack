Ricardo,

I will be joining the East power desk at the beginning of October and I am 
trying to get up to speed on the PJM market. Kevin Prestor thought you would 
be able to help me find some data. I am looking for the following historics 
in excel format (send as much data as you have and feel free to include 
anything else that you think might be relevant):

- Daily prices for PJM( West), Cinergy, NEPP, NYPP, TVA and ERCOT
- HDD's and CDD's for Philedelphia, Allentown Washington DC, Baltimore, 
Pittsburg, Newark, New York City, Cinncinati and any other cities that are 
relevant ?
- Supply outage data for PJM
- Daily Import / Exprot data for PJM
- Historic daily nat gas prices Transco Zone 6 ( NY and Non-NY), Chicago, ... 
???

Again, please feel free to make any suggestions. I am very new to the world 
of power and it is likely that I have overlooked something very obvious.

Thanx,

Chris Dorland
