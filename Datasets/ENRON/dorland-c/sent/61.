Subject: Market Opening Dates

Hey Chris,

I am doing some research on historical prices in surrounding power markets 
and I am trying to determine the wholesale market-opening dates for NE power 
markets. I am also interested in dates when locational marginal pricing (LMP) 
was implemented (if at all).

I was able to get dates for every market but Cinergy and ECAR. Please let me 
know if you can tell me who to contact, and/or if someone in Houston can dig 
this up for me.

I don't mean to be a burden, but Jeff Borg was hoping I could come up with 
this for a 3:00pm meeting today.

Thanks bro,

Dan
