Scott,

I think your EOL report was incorrect regarding the Henry Hub gas daily deals 
from Mar.28th.

Mike and I had a total of 3 sales at 2.945

2 done by Mike

EOL ID #'s
132116
132569

and 1 done by me

EOL ID #
132967

The trade I did was done late in the day and you might have missed it.

We added the deal back to our model. 

Let me know if there are any problems.

Chris
