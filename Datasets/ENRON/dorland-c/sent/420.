Kramer,

How are things going? We are thinking of coming to SF on a golf / party trip 
sometime in the  next few months.

Things in Calgary are relatively unchanged. No chicks. Work is going great. 
Cowan and I are trading Alberta and having a great time. 

Poker and buying electronics have become the hobbies of choice around here. I 
am terrible at poker but good at buying electronics.

Take it easy and w/b,

Dorland
