Kramer, 

Cowan is trading Alberta cash and I'm trading the front of the curve. Lavo 
still trades the term in Alberta but is never around. As for Benny, after an 
unfortunate incident at September's craw fish boil, he has moved to Houston 
to trade power. No shit! 

Drop me a line with a number where you can be reached. I have an idea, like 
everyone else in the world, for an internet start up and want to pick your 
brain about the process of doing a business plan, getting VC $'s and such. I 
don't know if you know much about that stuff but your thoughts would be 
greatly appreciated. I have a friend in the Internet group at Goldman Sach's 
and I've talked to him about it but I want insight from someone inside the 
industry.

There is a revolution going on and I think I am the only one not getting rich 
off of it. 

Check out enron stock (ENE). We announced an alliance with Sun Microsystems 
to build a bandwidth network and the stock has doubled in a month. Not bad 
for a small Texas pipeline company. You would need a sand blaster to get the 
smile off of Lavorato's face. However I don't think I'm going to retire on my 
Enron options any time soon.

Gotta hop!

Dorland

(PS You should send Wilson a Bigwords t-shirt. The Jannon's would do the logo 
justice.)
