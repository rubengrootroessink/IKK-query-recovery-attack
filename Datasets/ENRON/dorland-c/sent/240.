How are things going? Learning lots? Went to the rodeo and then to Nashville 
North yesterday so feeling a little fuzzy today. I'm not doing anything today 
but tommorow I am going to the rodeo and then to a big industry party so that 
should be good for a headache. Friday I'm going to the Chick Wagon party and 
Saturday to Nashville North with the boys. Weather has been good and looks 
like that will continue. Did you find a gym yet?
