Dear Ann Landers:

I am a sailor in the merchant navy. My parents live in Mississauga and one
of my sisters, who lives in Toronto, is married to a natural gas trader from
Calgary. My Father and Mother have recently been arrested for growing and
selling marijuana and are currently dependent on my two sisters, who are
prostitutes. I have two brothers, one who is currently serving a life
sentence in a Winnipeg prison for the rape & murder of a teenage boy in
1994, the other is currently being held in the Kingston jail on remand for
charges of incest with  his three children.

I have recently become engaged to marry a former Thai prostitute who indeed
is still a part time "working girl" in a brothel, however, her time there is
limited as she has recently been infected with an STD. We intend to marry as
soon as possible and are currently looking into the possibility of opening
our own brothel with my fianc, utilising her knowledge of the industry
working as the manager. I am hoping my two sisters would be interested in
joining our team. Although I would prefer them not to prostitute themselves,
it would at least get them off the streets and hopefully the heroin.

My problem is this: I love my fianc, and look forward to bringing her into
the family and of course I want to be totally honest with her.

Should I tell her about my brother-in-law being a gas trader?
