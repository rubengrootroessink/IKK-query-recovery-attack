> electricity.
> The system, expected to go online next week, will be offered to
> Spectron's clients via a secure platform. It follows similar
> initiatives for coal and industrial metals.
> "We will effectively be offering the same service as we already offer
> our gas and electricity clients, but via an internet connection
> instead of the phone," said Jim Martinek, a partner at Spectron.
> The broker believes customers increasingly want to be able to conduct
> business while away from the office, Mr Martinek said. Internet-based
> trading allows them to process bids and offers from a remote point.
> The online system could also encourage increased trading of gas and
> electricity in continental Europe.
> Consumption of gas and electricity in continental Europe is about 10
> times the amount consumed in the UK, but only about 5 per cent is
> traded, Spectron said.
> That contrasts with the UK market, where brokers trade twice the
> volume of natural gas consumed. In Scandinavia, where there is a
> highly developed electricity market, brokers trade five times the
> amount of electricity consumed, Spectron said.
> "Working via an internet connection breaks down barriers such as
> language and time differences, which we hope will help boost trading,"
> Mr Martinek said.
> Spectron has 2,000 subscribers to its internet-based coal trading
> system, and claims to have captured 15 per cent of the US-brokered OTC
> coal market.
> It also provides online trading facilities for specialist metals.
