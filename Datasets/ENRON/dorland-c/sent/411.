Mike,

Good to hear you arrived safely. Reno was very average. Too much travel. I 
guess you know all about that.

Hope that work is going well. I am trying to take it relatively easy on Rob.  
Benson's email is Rob.Benson@enron.com, if that doesn't work try

Robert.Benson@enron.com. Let me know if those don't work.

Gotta hop! 

Keep in touch,

Chris
