Mike,

What's going on? I'm coming home Nov.22 for a few days. Ryan and I are going 
to go snowboarding on Friday the 24th. You should come. I am really happy 
with my car. It is a silver/black IS 300. I was suffering a little post 
purchase anxiety but I'm over it. Fuck it! You live once. Things here are 
pretty good. It helps having a couple of good friends who have been here a 
while. How are things in Calgary? I hope you have pictures from Halloween. 
Send me you address and phone #'s. I lost my old address book. I am loving 
this palm pilot. You have to get one of these things. I am going to buy a 
playstation sometime this week. Should I buy Tony Hawk 1 or 2? Better hop. 
I'll call you one night this week.

Chris
