Listen up,

Let me know if anyone of you is interested in getting one...
One of my friends has started his importing business selling handfree kits
for mobile phones.  Basically, this new product from Turkey can work with
Ericission, Motorola, Nokia and all kind of mobile phones including any new
WAP phones.  As a promotion item it costs only $2 each with limited stock
available.  For your reference, I've attached a picture showing the product.

Please let me know if you would like to buy one
