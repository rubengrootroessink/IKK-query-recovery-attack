Margaret,

Thank you for all you help getting my Visa application prepared. Do you know 
what documentation I need to have with me at the border? I was planning on 
bringing the following:

Passport
Driver's License
Birth Certificate
University Transcripts

Is there anything else that I need to bring?

Chris Dorland
