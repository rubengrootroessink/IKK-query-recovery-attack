Dawn,

How long does it usually take Blue Cross to refund $ for the flexible 
spending account? I sent in a claim form a month ago and haven't seen 
anything yet. The reason I'm concerned is that when my brother moved he did a 
change of address and my mail has been screwed up ever since.

Thanx,

Chris
