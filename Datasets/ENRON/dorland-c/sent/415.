Jeremy,
In the last few months our intramonth books have seen very large swings in 
their P&L due simply to currency positions.  The traders want to be able to 
hedge this risk but the problem is that there are no reports in ERMS that 
meet their currency information requirements.

We need reports similar to those reports which we are able to produce for our 
term books

Crv Shift (Implicit)  - to show price curve shift by pub code
Curr Hedge   - to show currency curveshift by month
Implicit Position Report  - to show gas and USD positions by month
Top Page Canada  - to correctly bucket price curveshift verses currency 
curveshift

We need these reports to work for all of our intramonth books (physical, 
financial, gas daily).  

physical postids:  accued: 698871, MTM: 698872
financial postid:     698876
gas daily:   698877


All of these reports currently work for our term books (698669) but none of 
our intramonth books (there reports come out blank)

This issue  is of CRITICAL importance to us - our IM book is seeing 
SIGNIFICANT swings in p&l due to currency exposure.  We had originally asked 
for currency reports from you approx 6 months ago (requested by Walt).  We 
now need this ASAP.

The most important IM book which we need reports for is the IM financial book 
and the most important report we need in the Implicit Position Report.
I understand that this will take a considerable amout of your time but this 
is VERY important to the profitability of Enron Canada.  Please call be to 
dicuss a timeline.
