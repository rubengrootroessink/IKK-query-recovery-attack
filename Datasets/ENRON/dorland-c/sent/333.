Hey buddy,

 What were you doing in Mexico?  Must have been really nice!  As far
as tomorrow is concerned, I think that we may have a few drinks before the
club scene, so you are more than welcome to stop over for a few. I would love
to introduce you to some of my "single" friends.  Actually, pretty much all
of them are single right now. (Teehee). Anyhow, I imagine that we will begin
at about 8 or so, hope to see ya there. I live in Marda Loop in the SW. It's
just off off Crowchild. My address is #2, 2106, 35th ave SW. Exit onto 33rd,
and it's easy from there. If you have any ques'ns, call me @ 249-1571.
Depending on which way you come, it is really easy to find. You can also get
there by 14th, or 17th, but in either case, you will still turn onto 33rd.
Talk to you soon!
