Hey Dad and Chris,

How's it going? I was just wondering if I could ask for you and mom's help on 
a few things before the end of the summer. First, I want to start advertising 
my Jeep for sale, so I was hoping you might spruce it up a bit for me. It 
just needs a good cleaning inside and out (i.e. Lazerwash) before getting its 
picture taken for the ads. Also, the sticker on the rear window should be 
removed and it probably wouldn't hurt to have it Mr. Lubed one more time.

There are a couple of other things, but I think you said not to worry about 
them: Windshield is very cracked and tint on back window has a scrape on it. 
Don't worry about $$$ because whatever it costs you, I'll reimburse you from 
the proceeds.

I was thinking I'll list it in the Red Deer and Calgary Auto/Canada Trader 
magazines. If you call them, they set up an appointment with you to take a 
picture and get the vehicle listed. I have their phone numbers in both Red 
Deer (346-1969) and Cowtown (250-2122), but I think we should get the surfing 
machine tuned up first.

Second, I was hoping I could get a few things sent out here asap. As I 
mentioned before, I want to get involved in some adventurous stuff on the 
weekends, if possible. I found that I can take my Advanced PADI scuba here in 
one weekend, so I was hoping to get my fins, mask, snorkel and booties sent 
out here. I think they are in the basement. 

I would also love to get that box of movies from Chris and my golf 
clubs/shoes, si possible. Don't worry about the golf clubs if they are a 
hastle though b/c I probably wouldn't use them more than once or twice.

I hope this is not a big inconvenience to you guys. I just wanted to get the 
ball rolling on this before the summer's end.

Thanks alot and I'll talk to you soon,

Dan
