Did you notice the stock market is a little lower today. The fucking nasdaq 
is down 10 % today and the dow  was down almost 5% at one point. The TSE was 
down 770 to 8880 at one point. I think that a lot of margin positions got 
squeezed out of teck length. I say buy the solid stocks CSCO, LU , MSFT, ENE 
all look great.
