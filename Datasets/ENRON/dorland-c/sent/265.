Dear Chapters Customer,

Included in this e-mail is the electronic coupon we told you about during 
your recent visit to Chapters.ca.
By following the steps listed below, you will be able to receive $5 off your 
next purchase on the site!
A $10 minimum order amount before tax and shipping applies to this offer.

Your coupon number is:

ETYLE618IG636980185

?  First, return to www.chapters.ca
?  Select your title(s) by adding them to your Chapters.ca Shopping Bag.
?  When you're ready to pay for your order, go to the Shopping Bag page.
?  On this page, you'll find a space for your coupon number.
?  Enter your coupon number here, then click "Checkout".
?  On the next page (the Order Summary), you'll see that your $5 coupon will 
be applied to your purchase.
?  Click "Purchase" to complete your order.
?  Minimum purchase of $10 applies (minimum amount refers to order sub-total).

Before redeeming your coupon, please read
the following carefully:

1. These coupons expire on the earlier of either midnight
on September 30, 2000 or the date Chapters Online terminates the offer,
whichever comes sooner. Limit of one coupon per customer.

2. Chapters.ca coupons can only be redeemed with orders
placed through the checkout process. Coupons cannot be redeemed
with QUICK BUY orders.

3. Chapters.ca coupons do not have a cash value and can
only be redeemed on this Web site. These vouchers will not be
accepted at any Chapters, Coles or SmithBooks  stores.

4. You can redeem only one coupon per order. You cannot combine
the value of several coupons for use with one order. Chapters.ca
coupons are worth the amount indicated upon delivery to you.

5. Only the person to whom the coupon was issued (the person
who received the coupon by e-mail), can redeem it. At present,
coupons are non-transferable.

6. The order is free if the value of your purchase - including
shipping - is less than the value of the coupon. No cash back,
refund or "change" is given for a redeemed coupon.

7. In the case of a multiple-item order, the value of the coupon
is applied against the title or titles which can be shipped
immediately.  Any remaining coupon value is then deducted from the total
of the back-ordered items.  If a back-ordered book is unavailable, a new
coupon equal to the redeeming value of the original coupon can be issued to 
you.
Please e-mail us at info@chapters.ca for details.


If you have any questions about redeeming your coupons,
please send an e-mail to promotions@Chapters.ca.


Thank you for visiting Chapters.ca!
