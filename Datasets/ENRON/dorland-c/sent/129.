I am wondering if you know which moving company Enron uses to move people to 
Houston. Despite the fact that I haven't seen the formal offer I think I 
should book a  mover so I don't get stuck. Let me know if you know or if 
there is someone in Houston I should talk to (Jennifer?). 

Thanx,

Chris
