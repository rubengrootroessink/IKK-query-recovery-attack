I never get any good jokes which is why I haven't been sharing any. I am 
having a shitting week. Sick and tired. I can't wait for the weekend. I am 
going to sleep and golf. Where are you going on vacation? There aren't many 
weekends left in the summer and that sucks! Out of the weekends that are left 
I have two weddings and one stag, a trip to Houston and a trip to Toronto. I 
am never going to play any golf.
