Ryan,

Good to hear things are going well. I am still with Enron but I am in the 
process of moving to Houston. I'm going down there to trade electricity so 
that should be interesting change from nat gas. No wife. No house. No liver. 
That's about it. Hope India was a good time. 

Keep in touch!

Chris
