Chris,

We have set up a new USERID for you which has all of the same trading rights 
as the old one and is working fine down here. The USERID is ADM40092 and the 
default password on it is "WELCOME6". Just let me know if you have any 
trouble at all with it in the morning. In the meantime, Mark Dilworth and Jay 
Webb are still looking over the old USERID to see what exactly is happening 
with it.

Torrey
