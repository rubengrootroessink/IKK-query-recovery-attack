Brad 

Could you cancel my PAC plan after the September contribution.

I have thought more about the leverage idea you suggested and want to talk to 
you. Can I give you a call later this afternoon? What time are you going to 
be in the office until? What is you home phone number. I will be at the 
office late tonight working on move shit.
