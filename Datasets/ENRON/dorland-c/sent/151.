I went to Kelly Blue Book on the internet and they provide 2 values for used 
vehicles, a trade in value (what you might expect to get for a vehicle from a 
dealer on trade in) and a retail value (what you might expect to pay for a 
vehicle from a dealer). The following were the values it came up with for a 
Jeep exactly like mine in Montana (closest state).

Trade In - $15330 USD ($22750 CND)
Retail - $20945 USD ($31061 CND)

The retail number seems way too high. I think something like $23 000 to 
$25000 would be fair.

Let me know what you think.
