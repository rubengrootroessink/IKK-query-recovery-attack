I was not hung over yesterday. I had 3 beers and went home. How about that 
for self control? I watched women's gymnastics olympic trials on saturday 
night and did some laundry. What a loser I am. I am going to Sylvan this 
weekend. My friend Meghan is moving to Sydney Australia and Saturday is her 
going away party. Meg's cabin parties are  generally epic gong shows. I need 
to rest up this week. I bought in-line pants at the Gap yesterday. Now if I 
get some rollerblades I'll have the official pants. I don't think you need to 
take your rollerblades in to get the wheels rotated every week. Can't you do 
it yourself? I could probably even do it and I'm the most mechanically inept 
person in the world.
