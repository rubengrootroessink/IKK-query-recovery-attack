Tasha.

Good to hear from you. I have been quite busy. I am out of town all of next 
week but we should get together some time.
In terms of careers I don't have much in the way of ideas. Have you thiught 
about sales of some sort. I think you would be good at that. Not necessarily 
business to consumer sales but perhaps business to business sales. Just a 
thought.
