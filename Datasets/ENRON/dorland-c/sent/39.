Anne,

I still haven't received any pay stubs since I have been in Houston. Can I 
get copies of those somehow? Could you send my something in the inter-company 
mail so I can see if my mail stop has been really been changed? I haven't 
received any mail of any kind which seems kind of weird. 

Thanx 

Chris Dorland

(P.S. thanx for the PRC info.)
