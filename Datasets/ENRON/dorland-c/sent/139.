Nav,

How are you doing? What are you doing? I am still working for Enron. I have 
been trading nat gas for about 3 years. I am moving to Houston at the end of 
the month. In my next life I am going to be trading electricity in the NE US. 
Should be interesting. Crazy volatility. I will probably have a heart attack 
at 26 but that's life. Hope things are going well for you.

w/b 

Chris Dorland
