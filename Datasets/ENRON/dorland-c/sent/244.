When I think of sunnies I think of those little glasses you wear in tanning 
beds. Your sunglasses are fine. I wore them while I was hangin' around the 
house last night. My neighbors think I am a total freak. Maybe it wasn't the 
sunglasses but the "Sweatin' to the Oldies" I was blaring on my stereo all 
night . I think Richard Simmons is a totally misunderstood genius. I am so 
bored. I'm going to the rodeo this afternoon so that should be good. Better 
get back to doing NOTHING!
