I am 80% going to the rodeo on Thursday. It is the Enron customer party that 
day. As for Nashville North I don't know if we are going there or somewhere 
else after. I am a huge bed wetter when it comes to drinking on school 
nights. I likely won't be going out again until Friday or Saturday. Am I 
going to get an eye infection if I continue to wear your sunglasses around 
town? I hope not. Chicks dig me in those glasses.
