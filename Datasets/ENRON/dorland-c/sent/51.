Patrick,

Good to hear from you. I won't be needing my blubber where I am. I moved to 
Houston at the end of September. Things here are good. I'm trading 
electricity in the North Eastern US and so far things are going pretty well. 
I never did make it to Toronto this summer. Hope things are going well for 
you and keep in touch. 

Chris
