Mike,

How are things going? I trust that you are adjusting relatively easily. 

Things have been relatively quiet lately. Doing a little snowboarding and 
watching lots of movies. Trying to drag my lazy ass to the gym at least 4 
days a week. So far I'm at one in a row. Things are looking good for a repeat 
today.

Laird popped by today and brought us some lattes and saw the office. For all 
your hard work we are actually getting some term business done with Optimum 
now.
I think Lambie helped them out there.

Take care,

Chris
