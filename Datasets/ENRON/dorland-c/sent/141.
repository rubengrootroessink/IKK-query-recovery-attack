I have never done a houseboating trip but they sound like a lot of fun. Was 
the weather good? Houston was hot. Very hot. I better get used to it though 
because I'm moving there. That is why I have been so crazy lately. I am going 
down there to trade power in the North East. Pretty crazy shit. I gotta hop 
but I'll write more later.
