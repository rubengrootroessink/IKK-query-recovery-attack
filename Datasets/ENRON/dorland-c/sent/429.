Just thought I would let you know that we have a prowler in our midst. I had 
about $30 worth of change (loonies and twoonies) taken from my desk drawer 
between Friday and this morning.

Could have been the smed guys, the cleaning staff or the Easter bunny for all 
I know. 

Just thought I would mention it because Milly said he had the same thing 
happen to him last week.
