The stag was a total monkey show. We played golf and pool, ate some dinner, 
took in the ballet and the hit the bars. I did manage to get a couple of 
rounds of golf in between all the drinking. I actually played pretty good. 
Houseboating sounds like fun. I've never done that. I am so on the wagon. I 
can't express to you how little I'm going to drink this weekend. Lots of 
golf.
