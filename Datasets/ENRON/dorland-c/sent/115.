Kim,

I received the benefit book and will look through it tonight. Do you know the 
name of the lady I am susposed to be in contact with at Enron relocation 
services? She called me yesterday but I have forgotten her name. I am 
wondering if I need to have my visa done before she will book the movers. In 
regards to my visa, I have gathered pretty much all the info. that Margaret 
needs with the exception of University transcripts. I had to order those and 
probably won't get them untill early next week.

Thank you for all your help!

Chris
