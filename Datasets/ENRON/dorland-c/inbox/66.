Hi Chris!

I followed up with the same IRS representative I spoke with in November
regarding your missing cheque.  I wish I had better news for the holiday
season.

Three traces were placed on your missing refund cheque and three times the
trace has been rejected.  The IRS doesn't know why.  They are placing a
formal inquiry into the matter.  The representative I spoke with has
admitted that somebody on the IRS' end isn't doing what they are supposed
to be doing and he promised me they'd get down to the matter.  I can only
tell you that I will follow up again in January of the new year.

In the meantime, have a very Merry Holiday Season and a Wonderful New Year!

Best regards,
