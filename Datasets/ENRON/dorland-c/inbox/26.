Stay with a positive investment approach. =09
 Corporate  accounting and earnings quality issues, high P/Es and fear of a=
dditional terrorism remain a drag on the market. Another  restraint: Dynami=
c leadership is absent and may not be seen until signs  of improvement in i=
nformation technology spending breathe new life into  that deeply depressed=
 sector.  But  barring dramatic new financial irregularity disclosures, the=
 chances  are good the market will soon start moving forward again. The dri=
ving  force, we believe, will be an improving economy.  S&P  chief economis=
t David Wyss feels that if inventory rebuilding accelerates  sharply in the=
 period just ahead, it is possible the first quarter will  show strong GDP =
growth and the second quarter a relapse into negative  territory. He points=
 out that the 1990-91 recession was the only one  since the 1950s that did =
not have a positive quarter sandwiched between  down quarters. Wyss thinks =
the more likely scenario, however, is a smoother  pace of inventory accumul=
ation and rising quarter-to-quarter GDP growth  through 2002. This forecast=
 implies upward-trending earnings this year  and next.  Investors,  burned =
badly by the 2000-2001 bear market, are in a show-me state of  mind. Short =
sellers and others who bet stocks will fall have become  bolder lately, and=
 institutions have been moving cautiously. All of  this suggests that a goo=
d deal of fuel for an advance exists.   It  wasn't a good omen that the S&P=
 500 index slipped in January, losing  1.6%. As mentioned a week ago, of th=
e 19 times in the postwar period  that the "500" has fallen in January, the=
 index then went  on to score a gain for the full year only seven times and=
 suffered a  loss for the year 12 times. That was against a backdrop of 2.4=
 up years  for each down year for the 56 years from 1946 through 2001.   On=
  the other hand, a decline in the S&P 500 this year would be the  third in=
 a row, and that hasn't happened since 1941.=09
