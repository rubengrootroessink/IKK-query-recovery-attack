Ryan and Chris, the last payments we made to Zargon were on January 9, 2002.  These were for January gas options VH6370.1 and .2 in Canadian dollars and for December oil swap QD2986.1 in US dollars.  We have not been able to invoice the oil swap for January as we will not have NXAVCPROMPT until early Feb.  Call me if you need more info.

Hi Laura,

Chris and I are working on the Zargon termination calculations, and we need to know what we owe them or what they owe us as of today? I think we owe them money for some Crude Oil put options we sold them, but need just wanted to confirm.

Thanks,
Ryan
