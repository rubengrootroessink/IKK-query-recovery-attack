Glad to hear from ya toughguy.  I was just kidding about the grumpy jab.   I
could just tell Houston wasn't in your top 300 places to live in.    Glad to
hear your keeping it real up there.   Keep in touch.   I let you know about
stampede plans as we get closer.   Thanks again for the call.

Mr. Wonderful
