***********************************************************************

LOOKING FOR THE VALUE IN ENVIRONMENTAL STRATEGIES

Corporate leaders often found it difficult to determine if environmental
strategies are paying off. As a broader set of corporate stakeholders
influences the shape of environmental strategy, corporate leaders regularly
encounter conflicting evaluations of their performance and frequently lack the
evidence to justify changes in strategy.

*  Increasing shareholder value is the ultimate success factor but corporations
cannot easily demonstrate a direct link between how an environmental strategy
is implemented and shareholder value.

*  Corporations are searching for proxy indicators that often blend the
quantitative and the intuitive from both internal and external sources.

*  Recognizing that a broader set of evaluation tools are required reduces the
frustration of searching for the perfect performance measure and, in the long
term, improves assessment efforts.
