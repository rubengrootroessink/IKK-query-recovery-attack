Title: Hydro and Gas Storage Dampen Western Winter Markets
URL(s):

http://www.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2908;


***********************************************************************

CONTINUED WESTERN MARKET SOFTNESS
High gas storage levels and western power storage in the form of growing
hydroelectric reserves will dampen prices for both commodities through
the winter and potentially deep into next year. Milder weather, retail
electricity price increases, economy-related demand reductions, improved
western hydroelectric conditions, generating capacity additions, and a natural
gas price decline will keep winter markets soft. Henry Hub prices have held
relatively strong in the face of extremely bearish fundamentals. Over the
next month, gas storage inventories will eventually weigh down prices, as that
near-term impact overshadows long-term concerns about declining US production
and weakening rig counts.

* Compared to first quarter 2001, power fundamentals in first quarter 2002 will
be characterized by 30 percent higher hydroelectric output and 8 percent lower
electricity demand.

* Western gas storage inventories remain very strong and increasing supply in
the Rockies and exports from western Canada will lower Rockies and San Juan gas
prices.

* Poor winter 2000/2001 precipitation left the Pacific Northwest vulnerable to
tight power supplies at the start of this winter, recent storms have eliminated
reliability concerns.
