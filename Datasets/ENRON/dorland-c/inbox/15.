Hello Chris,

Sorry I didn't get back to you yesterday, swamped here at work.

How was cooking class?  Are you going to be the next up and coming Emrill?
I am interested to here how they recommend making stock.  For me it has
always been good 'ol Campbell's broth and add from there! Pathetic or what?

Saturday sounds good.  Open for suggestions.

Talk with you soon!

Trace
