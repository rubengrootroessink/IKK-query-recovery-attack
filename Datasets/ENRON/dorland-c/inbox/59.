HEY!  How are ya?  What a great surprise!
we're all good here.  Working as per usual - snore.....teaching part time

How's Calgary?  Are you glad to be back in Canada?
I talked to your Mom just after New Years - sounds like you guys had fun in
Fernie.

I heard about you taking that photo of Maddy - isn't it funny??  She's
pretty much a character - I know you're wondering where she gets is from.

What's new with you?

Al
