Hi Chris,

I will have Tamara Utsch reply to you on your refund - I believe she
updated you last week, but we'll see if there's new news this week.

Can you please send me your current home address so we can send you an
organizer?

Thanks,

   Hi Chris,

   We would be happy to prepare your 2001 returns.   My understanding is
   that
   you moved back from Texas to Canada in 2001, so you will require both a
   US
   return and a part year Canadian return.

   Our fee for this service is $2,600 Cdn. funds + GST.

   Please provide your current address, home phone number, etc. so we can
   add
   you to our list and send you an organizer.

   Kind regards,

   Tamara,

   Any updates on my IRS refund? Also I need a contact for my 2001 returns.
   As
   I will now be working for UBS I will probably be paying privately to
   have
   my return done but I would still like PWC to do both my US and Canadian
   returns for 2001. Please advise.

      Hi Chris!

      I followed up with the same IRS representative I spoke with in
   November
      regarding your missing cheque.  I wish I had better news for the
   holiday
      season.

      Three traces were placed on your missing refund cheque and three
   times
      the
      trace has been rejected.  The IRS doesn't know why.  They are placing
   a
      formal inquiry into the matter.  The representative I spoke with has
      admitted that somebody on the IRS' end isn't doing what they are
      supposed
      to be doing and he promised me they'd get down to the matter.  I can
      only
      tell you that I will follow up again in January of the new year.

      In the meantime, have a very Merry Holiday Season and a Wonderful New
      Year!

      Best regards,

      Tamara L. Utsch
