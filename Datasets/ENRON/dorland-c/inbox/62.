Title: India-Pakistan War? Risks and Implications
URL(s):

http://www.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2923;


***********************************************************************

INDIA-PAKISTAN WAR? RISKS AND IMPLICATIONS

Prospects are growing that a short, sharp war could occur between India and
Pakistan over the next several weeks. It is not inevitable; diplomacy could
still pull the two parties back.

*  Such a war--if it does occur--need not prompt doomsday predictions or
excessive global concern so long as both countries see short-term political
advantages accruing from a tightly contained conflict.

*  It would have a complicating but manageable impact on the American-led
counterterrorism effort in south and central Asia.

*  A very limited-duration conflict could even lead to intensive multilateral
efforts to solve the Kashmir dispute, the central dispute between India and
Pakistan.
