Investment ideas
-----------------------------------------

1. Strong buys: Enterprise is looking up
There is cautious optimism among enterprise software developers.

By Shannon Swingle, contributing editor

Business could be picking up for enterprise software companies, but only a few analysts
are moving into upgrade territory. The most recent quarterly reports for a handful of
companies showed strong results, but only time will tell.

This week, two enterprise software companies in Multex's Internet index have moved
into the "strong buy" territory among the average recommendations. Those companies are
Mercury Interactive (MERQ) and Siebel Systems (SEBL). So what is making analysts
take notice of these companies?

2. Broadly viewed: What is the value of the digital home?
Comcast is paying approximately $5,830 for each AT&T Broadband household. Is this a fair price?

By Ben Macklin, senior analyst, eMarketer

Comcast (CMCSA) is in the process of acquiring AT&T's (T) broadband unit and its 12
million cable households for approximately $70 billion. Comcast's investment equates to
approximately $5,830 per AT&T Broadband household.  Is this a fair price?

As has been widely reported, this deal will create the largest cable company in North
America, with 22.3 million subscribers. The current value of the digital home is far less
than what Comcast is currently paying, but the future digital home may hold great
potential.

3. Take a bow: Can eBay give investors an encore?
The company is confident that it can maintain super-fast growth, and analysts agree.

by Dave Sterman, equity research columnist

The economic landscape is littered with the carcasses of dot-coms that tried but
failed. Only one firm can say that it consistently delivered on its initial growth
metrics: eBay (EBAY). In 1998, when the online auction company went public, it
was set to bag some $86 million in revenue. Three years later, that figure has
exploded to $749 million, and operating profits have risen thirteen-fold.

With shares of eBay trading at lofty heights, investors are clearly expecting more strong
growth to come. Can eBay deliver? The answer, according to those who analyze the
company, is a resounding "yes."

4. E-commerce insights: E-commerce comes out from under the shadows
Companies used to be reluctant to discuss Internet sales, but are now breaking the silence

By Steve Butler, senior analyst, eMarketer

Until recently, many companies were reluctant to discuss e-commerce because
they did not want to share their strategies with competitors. Today, however,
companies announce e-business initiatives to show that they are in tune with the
times and prepared to face tough competition in the future.

By comparing a company's e-commerce activity to that of its competitors, shareholders
may gain insight into how well management has grasped the main issues of e-business,
developed an integrated technology strategy, and executed its vision.
