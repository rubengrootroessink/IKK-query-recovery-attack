Investment ideas
-----------------------------------------

1. INVESTING STRATEGIES
Why $30 and not $130?
Buying stocks without knowing why prices are what they are is
dangerous to your financial health.

By Marc Gerstein, director of investment research

Here's the moral of the story. You should always, always, always, always
be able, in your mind, to construct some sort of logical connection
between today's stock price and a stream of future dividends. The logical
chain might be long: you might assume years of startup losses will be
followed by more years of all profits being reinvested. But you should be
able to envision some connection between today's stock prices and a
stream of dividends that will commence someday in the future. You don't
actually have to do the math. But you should feel comfortable that the
numbers are such that if you wanted to take the time to do it as an
interesting exercise, you could come up with some plausible set of
assumptions that make the present-day price seem somewhere in the
ballpark.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
A tale of two values
This pair of wireless infrastructure stocks offers long-
term growth--don't let the prices fool you

By Ben Mattlin, equity research columnist

Over the past two years, as the market's become more
challenging, investors are learning to be more selective than they
used to be. Rather than seizing momentum and growth, which
worked well in the '90s, successful investors are adopting a value
orientation.

But which discounted stocks represent true value and which are
inexpensive simply because the company they symbolize is no
good? In telecom, where most stocks have gotten hammered, it
can be especially difficult to distinguish between duds bargains.
