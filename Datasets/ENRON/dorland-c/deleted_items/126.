ANNOUNCING A FLEXIBLE NEW WAY TO REDEEM YOUR STARPOINTS!

With "Cash & Points Award Nights" from Starwood Preferred Guest(R),
you can enjoy a few rounds of golf in Los Cabos ... take the kids to
Orlando for the weekend ... or plan a romantic getaway to Bali with
just a few Starpoints(R) and a little cash!

Depending on the hotel category, you can purchase Award Nights for
either 2,800 Starpoints and $45 USD per night, or 4,000 Starpoints
and $60 USD per night. Participating hotels outside of the U.S.
feature the same Starpoint values combined with the local currency
equivalent of $45 USD or $60 USD at time of reservation. To take
advantage of these savings, make your reservations by April 30, 2002
and travel through December 30, 2002.

Terms & Conditions:
Offer is valid for members with at least 2,800 Starpoints in their
accounts. Reservations must be made by April 30, 2002, for travel
through December 30, 2002. Guest is responsible for all taxes and
service charges associated with the award reservation. Local
guarantee and cancellation policy applies. Guest will not receive
Starpoints or airline miles for their stays. Due to local currency
fluctuations for hotels outside of the U.S., the cash component for
these hotels will be quoted at the time of reservation and will
remain static until the reservation is consumed.
