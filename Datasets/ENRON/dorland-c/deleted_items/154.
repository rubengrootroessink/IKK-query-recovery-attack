This $4.50 stock does more sales per year than Amgen, Yahoo and
eBay combined. This stock's net profit last year was almost as much
as eBay's entire gross sales in 2000. No wonder this stock is a
prime takeover target! It was trading around $60 last July and is
now a steal. Buy low!

Investment ideas
-----------------------------------------

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
The spillover from Enron
New issues to watch for this earnings season

By Rick Wayman, CFA

This earnings season should prove to be especially interesting not only
because of what the bottom lines may indicate, but also because of the
"spin" that companies will be using. There are several key factors that
will impact earnings in 4Q01 and fiscal year 2001 and seeing how
management will spin these factors should be a learning experience.

To cut through the spin, investors will need to be especially focused on
margins, both gross and operating, and footnotes. The impact will vary
among companies (even in the same sector) depending on their
accounting policies.

Europe: E-business leader?
How do results from SAP (SAP) reflect world markets for e-business

By Steve Butler, senior analyst, eMarketer

many technology industry observers last week with its preliminary
announcement of strong fourth quarter software license sales. Revenues
for the quarter were expected to exceed 1 billion euro, contributing to
