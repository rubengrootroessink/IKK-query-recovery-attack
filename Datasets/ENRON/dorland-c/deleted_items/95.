1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Hell freezes over (on a pro forma basis)
Could Amazon be pulling an Enron?

By Rick Wayman, CFA

I always thought that hell would freeze over before Amazon.com (AMZN)
posted a profit. This company, and the market's love affair with it, has
always amazed me. After all, how could a market (even an irrational one)
price this stock near $120 at a time when it was losing $0.44 on every
dollar of sales, which is what happened in 1999?

Ever since Jeff Bezos, the Prince of Pro Forma, announced that AMZN
would post a profit by the end of 2001, I eagerly awaited the release so I
could see how, not if, he would concoct the desired result.

I was not disappointed.

Consolidation and content
Wireless semiconductor stocks wrestle for share of a shrinking market

By Dave Sterman, equity research columnist

As we saw in the IPO market in recent years, fast-growing industries
attracted a number of new players. But now that those industries have
matured, growth has slowed and many smaller players are looking to
merge in order to compete against the top tier players. As we noted a
few weeks ago, wireless service providers in particular look set to
engage in a merger orgy.

It now appears that the same could be said for the wireless
semiconductor industry. As growth in wireless handset sales has slowed,
chip vendors are also looking to march down the aisle. In mid-December,
Alpha Industries (AHAA) and Conexant (CNXT) announced plans to
merge their wireless chip divisions.

And more deals may emerge in the months to come. "We wouldn't be
surprised to see additional activity as companies work to reach critical
mass at a much higher level than in the past," says CIBC's Dale Pfau.
Many players added factory capacity just as the industry slowed.
