Investment ideas
-----------------------------------------

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Bubble-free bullishness
Has the NASDAQ come too far too fast? Who cares! There are lots of other
great ideas available.

By Marc Gerstein, director of investment research, Multex Investor
Not everybody agrees with my generally bullish views of the stock
market. That, in itself, is not a big deal. Every day there are both buyers
and sellers, so you can never expect to see unanimity of opinion. What is
interesting is the sort of reasoning I often hear from bears. "Look how far
Juniper (or any one of countless other circa 1999 market superstars) has
come. It's way ahead of itself." "There's been so much overbuilding in
telecom, it will take years before supply and demand come back into
balance." Etc.
Such sentiments are fine, and for the most part, I agree with them. The
problem I have is that so many bears seem to confine their discussion to
the same group of stocks that mesmerized so many investors during the
bubble days. That's unfortunate. The same mistake that causes so much
financial pain on the way down seems likely to strike again. The source
of the pain: an inappropriately narrow view of the market that focuses
too much attention on too few stocks that often have too little investment
merit.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Amid industry funk, satellite radio makes dazzling debut
Analysts expect near-term pullback, but like the segment's
potential

by John Filar Atwood, equity research columnist

Perhaps you missed it. Amid the turmoil and growing economic uncertainty
of late 2001, XM Satellite Radio (XMSR) completed one of the most
successful consumer electronic product launches in years.

The company completed the national rollout of its digital audio radio
service, which delivers digital quality radio to cars via satellite. XMSR now
offers 100 channels coast to coast for a fee of $9.99 per month.

The company launched regionally in September and nationally in
November. By year-end, it had more than 30,000 subscribers. Analysts
agree that this level of success for a discretionary subscription-based
service during a severe economic downturn is exceptional.

Monthly matters
-----------------------------------------

What rate of return should you use when planning?
The whole point of financial planning is to ensure that you will have
what you need when you need it. In order to do this accurately, you need
a good idea of the anticipated rate of return you should use when
planning.
