Investment ideas
-----------------------------------------

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Analysts predict solid 2002 for cable TV stocks
Consolidation and EBITDA growth will be the year's major themes

by John Filar Atwood, equity research columnist

Investors relying on cable television stocks as a defensive investment were
disappointed in 2001, as the group fell by about 20 percent, compared with
the a drop of "just" 13 percent for the S&P 500. But investors who now
abandon the industry may find themselves even more disappointed in 2002.

Analysts are projecting a strong year for cable companies, predicting
revenue growth of 13 percent and EBITDA growth of 14 percent. They also
believe most of the stocks are more fairly valued heading into 2002 than
they were at the outset of last year, when a late-2000 runup left them
overpriced.

Adding to analysts' enthusiasm is the recent completion of Comcast's
(CMCSK) purchase of AT&T's (T) broadband unit. The merger
underscores the value of broadband and its ability to offer voice, data and
video over the same pipe.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
E-commerce across platforms--PC wins hands down
Wireless platforms have a role to play, but not in nailing sales

By Ben Macklin, senior analyst, eMarketer

Much has been made of the potential for e-commerce on mobile devices
and TV, but two leading research firms, Gartner and Forrester, predict
that in both Europe and the US, the PC will be the platform of choice for
e-commerce.

Gartner forecasts that by 2005, 72.6 percent of the US population will
access the Internet via PC, compared to 37 percent through an Internet
phone, and 16.5 percent through TV. They add that 42 percent of US e-
commerce buyers will regularly use multiple platforms.

WORD FROM OUR SPONSOR

Fixed-income funds finished the week only slightly down

Taxable income funds delivered a very narrow range of returns last week, with
the average fund nearly breaking even with a loss of only .01 percent.
International funds fared worse due to a weakening Euro.

The clock has counted down and the New Year has
