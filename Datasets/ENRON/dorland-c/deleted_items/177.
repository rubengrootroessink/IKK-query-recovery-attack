In today's edition of the Daily Update, Multex Investor's director of
investment research, Marc Gerstein, explains why he values Varian
Medical Systems (VAR) so highly.

Also, equity research columnist Dave Sterman has no tax advice to offer,
but he does have a take on a couple of companies taking divergent paths
along the tax advice road.

Morgan Stanley believes that the future of online banking is sure, and
thinks investors who agree should think about Digital Insight (DGIB),
which provides Web services to that industry. Members like you can
benefit from the firm's free research trial to read more.

Investment ideas
-----------------------------------------

1. INVESTING STRATEGIES
Varian Medical Systems (VAR)
Varian stock could flourish if investors focus on the company as
effectively as its x-rays focus on cancer.

By Marc Gerstein, director of investment research

Don't feel let down by the fact that VAR today isn't really a heavyweight
airport security play. The company's core business activities are really
quite attractive. The mere fact that VAR is in the healthcare sector starts
it off with a favorable presumption. You know the drill: aging
population, long-term secular growth in demand for all sorts of health-
related products and services. Obviously, not every healthcare stock will
be a winner. But as we'll see below, VAR has solid financial
fundamentals, thereby causing it to easily pass the tests that cause many
firms in this area to falter.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Taxes-dot-com
Two widely different strategies for navigating the tax Web

By Dave Sterman

For the last four years, the number of people filing their taxes online has
risen by at least 20 percent annually. And the folks at Intuit (INTU)
deserve a bunch of credit for the trend. Intuit's TurboTax software has
made it increasingly easy to complete and files taxes electronically,
eliminating the mistake-filled pen and paper process.

Curiously, H&R Block (HRB) has gone a different route. The tax prep
giant has stuck by its bricks and mortar model of handling taxes in
person. Block's TaxCut software also enables people to do their taxes on
a PC, but the company has done little to create a commanding Web
presence.
