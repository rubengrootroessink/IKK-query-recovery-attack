Investment ideas
-----------------------------------------

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
The long and the short
Economic factors that will impact the market and investors--and vice
versa

By Charles Payne, principal analyst, Wall Street Strategies

Last year capped the worst two-year stock tumble since 1973-1974, and
effectively eliminated all the hype and hope that mobilized individual
investors during the late 1990s. (Although it is unlikely that the
individuals who remain in the market continue to expect the returns of
yesteryear, investors probably still expect too much from the broad
market.)

Today, investors are understandably concerned about the market, and are
leery of chasing stocks. However, there will be a time during the year
when you've just missed the boat (as most missed it last year). And I'm
just as sure that something will test the resolve of the market--an event or
series of events that will send stocks tumbling.

However, I think it is a big mistake for investors to wait for it, or to wait
for some type of testing of the bottom. By the same token, however, I
think it is still important to take profits and maybe be a little more
flexible with stops. I suspect that after two years of depression, this
market will still suffer from bouts of mental instability. Let those bi-polar
moments work for you. There are tons of funds on the sidelines waiting
to chase this market. Keep a steady head, don't panic, and stop worrying
about the worse case scenarios. Fundamental change cannot happen until
we see a change of mind among investors.

Below are my thoughts on leading economic indicators, market trends,
my picks of the year, and some sector ideas.

2. INVESTMENTOR
Economic check-up
Seven economic indicators that point to a mid-year recovery

By William Valentine, CFA

Going to the doctor is not always a pleasant experience, but it's always
good to get a check-up. I'm reminded of the contrasts of such
experiences by the goings-on around the Valentine household. In the
same week that we're going to see our healthy in utero baby on an
ultrasound monitor, my Labrador retriever is going to see the doggy doc
in order to have his sireship extracted.

And it's with these visuals (you're welcome), that I lead you to my point
about check-ups and the economy. For it's time to check in on my "Big
Seven" indicators in order to see whether we'll get the mid-year recovery
that everyone seems to be counting on, or if this check-up leads to a dog-
on forecast.
