Chris,
 
I can't do February 2nd.  As it turns out my gal made  dinner arrangements a while ago with another couple for the evening of the  2nd.  Is there anyway you could either come a week earlier or later? I'd  love to have a few with you.  Let me know.  Have you called Bill  Ryan?
 
Regards,
 
Matt B. Walker
